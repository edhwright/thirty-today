That is what the Boston College basketball season has been reduced to, a game in the opening round of the Big East tournament that could lead to another game that could lead to something more; a high-stakes series of circumstances that must begin with Villanova on Thursday night.

There is the chance to continue the positive steps the Eagles have shown in a 9-9 Big East season, the most Boston College conference victories in a decade. There is the means of measuring progress from that painful night two years ago, when a 1-15 team lost a 10-point lead to Villanova on Thursday night. N.C.A.A.

Once again the anti-Communist hero, President Yeltsin, is fighting for political survival against a hostile, holdover Congress of People's Deputies, elected in the waning days of the old Soviet Union and packed with former Communist apparatchiks.    Despite the trappings of melodrama, extremely serious issues are at stake. President Yeltsin claims that his own political future and the future of reform are one and the same. Congressional leaders insist that they represent a more grass-roots version of reform and that Mr. Yeltsin's real aim is personal dictatorship. Mr. Yeltsin's authoritarian tendencies are undeniable.

Mr. Faddis, improvising with the arrangements and the instrumentation, created full-blown, distinct pieces that hadn't existed before. By pulling together a collection of riffs and vamps, and calling on soloists to improvise and compete against each other, he created something that had suspense.   The concert, the third in Carnegie Hall's jazz series, moved around a bit to build a historical narrative, linking Mr. Puente's extraordinary early orchestrations with pieces by another Latin-jazz pioneer, the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Mr. Puente's music, rife with elements of the more advanced be-bop composers and the rhythmic drive of Afro-Cuban music, merged perfectly with Mr. Gillespie's own Latin-influenced pieces, including \"Manteca\" and \"Woody 'n' You.\" The historical connection was there and easy to see.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"Nobel Laureate Warns, Don't Learn Too Much","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/education/nobel-laureate-warns-don-t-learn-too-much.html","abstract":"  With eyes bright as new ideas, with a slouch that failed to camouflage his intellectual swagger, the Nobel laureate James D.

There is little more painful or less inspiring of song than watching as someone you love is cut off from life by illness. But the curious thing about \"Wings,\" an 80-minute musical adaptation of Arthur Kopit's 1978 play, is how faintly it evokes the devastating emotions of the experience. I arrived at the New York Shakespeare Festival, where this production has been imported from the Goodman Theater in Chicago, with a pocketful of Kleenex. It was at once a relief and a disappointment to discover that its occasional and ineffectual stabs at sentimentality notwithstanding, \"Wings\" is more concerned with the mind than the heart.    Indeed, that is literally the case: like the Kopit play, to which it is largely faithful, this quasi opera is obsessed with the collapse of brain functions that is known as aphasia. In the opening scene, the elderly heroine, Emily (Linda Stephens), an aviator who long ago was an air-show wing walker, has her stroke, and the audience is immediately transported into a mind in which memories are obliterated, language is garbled, logic is short-circuited. Some of that voyage is accomplished visually, by shattered images projected on sliding screens, and some of it by the evocative Sensurround-style sonic effects created by Richard Woodbury. Most impressive, however, is Jeffrey Lunden's score, which uses the scrambling of a consciousness as a cue for musical experimentation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"BASEBALL: METS Notebook; Injury List for Mets In Midseason Form","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/sports/baseball-mets-notebook-injury-list-for-mets-in-midseason-form.html","abstract":"  There is no surgery scheduled, and so for the Mets there should perhaps be no cause for panic.

Simon & Schuster. $27.50.   In his classic study, \"An American Dilemma,\" published 49 years ago, Gunnar Myrdal wrote that the problems confronting disadvantaged blacks in a dominant white society put a spoke through the wheels of democracy. Yet the Swedish economist recognized that despite slavery and adversity, blacks helped to hold the country's social fabric together. In his chapter on black family life in the rural South, he said that blacks had built up their own kind of close-knit family organizations that were conducive to social health.   Now in \"Climbing Jacob's Ladder,\" Andrew Billingsley, a respected black sociologist, builds on Myrdal's work and offers his own surprisingly optimistic study about the inner strength and stability of black families. Professor Billingsley, chairman of the family studies department at the University of Maryland and visiting scholar in residence at Spelman College in Atlanta, finds that like white strivers on the lower rungs of society, blacks also want to gain entry into the American middle class. The new book, a sequel to his \"Black Families in White America,\" published in 1968, continues his argument that black families are born survivors and contain the seeds of their own rejuvenation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"In Europe, Musicals Get Varying Reactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/theater/in-europe-musicals-get-varying-reactions.html","abstract":"  Cole Porter may have epitomized dapper American sophistication between the world wars, but his image had a Gallic aura.

It seemed like punk bands couldn't age; they wouldn't allow themselves the luxury. But growing up doesn't have to mean settling down, as the Gang of Four proved in its show at the Limelight on Tuesday night.   The band gained fame in the late 1970's as one of the most intellectual punk groups, criticizing consumerism while creating a nearly irresistible product. Songs like \"I Love a Man in Uniform,\" \"Anthrax\" and \"Natural's Not in It\" (all heard Tuesday) are dialectical arguments transformed into sparse, insistent dance rock.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Review/Fashion; In Milan, a Costume Party","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/style/review-fashion-in-milan-a-costume-party.html","abstract":"  Score some more points for the costume-party look.

Hill & Wang, $25. \n\nIn 14 years of environmental reporting at The New York Times, Philip Shabecoff saw American environmentalism rise and fall and rise again. He met colorful characters from James Watt, Ronald Reagan's fundamentalist Interior Secretary, to David Brower, the grand curmudgeon who brought the Sierra Club to political life. On his beat the world reached an agreement to save the ozone layer and the Audubon Society fought about keeping the egret as its symbol.\n\nRecognizing how crucial the experience of the American land has been in shaping American environmental thought, Mr. Shabecoff begins his book with an east-to-west eagle flight over the continent as it would have appeared at the time of Columbus 500 years ago: occupied by natives, but virgin to a European eye, and blessed with passenger pigeons, buffalo, pristine waters and unbelievable riches in timber, minerals and soil.\n\nThe story continues through the Lewis and Clark expedition, through Daniel Boone, John James Aububon, Emerson, Thoreau and George Perkins Marsh in Woodstock, Vt., setting down in the 1860's the first principles of sustainable resource management. There is the strange association of President Theodore Roosevelt with Gifford Pinchot, the forester, and John Muir, the mountain man, whose interacting passions produced the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the preservation of Yosemite Valley as a national park and the flooding of Hetch Hetchy Valley, Yosemite's twin, to provide water and power for San Francisco. Already the battle between development and preservation was joined.\n\nThere is a parade of personalities: Rachel Carson, William O. Douglas, Lois Gibbs, the embattled housewife of Love Canal, and Aldo Leopold, the ecologist and game manager who appears to be one of the few people able to embrace both sides of the use-it-conserve-it dilemma. Mr. Leopold gave Mr. Shabecoff his title, in a passage that describes his own ecological conversion. \n\nSome years ago Mr. Leopold and some friends had found a mother wolf with her cubs and had shot them. \"We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce, green fire dying in her eyes,\" Mr. Leopold recalled in his book \"Sand County Almanac.\" \"I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes -- something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch. I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean a hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.\"\n\nMr. Shabecoff throws in this quote without connecting it to his title, but his position is not that the fierce, green fire of American environmentalism is dying. Rather, he sees it surging up and down in waves, three so far: first, the Roosevelt-Pinchot conservation movement of the early 1900's; second, the burst of landmark environmental legislation around the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, and third, the professionalism and pragmatism of the present.\n\nHis last chapter offers advice for the fourth wave. Get political, Mr. Shabecoff says. We have green publications, green technology, green products. Now we need green politics.\n\n\"To make the political breakthroughs necessary to achieve their goals,\" Mr. Shabecoff writes, \"the environmentalists \n\nmust \n\nmake common cause with other sectors of our society that have a stake in changing the political and economic status quo.\" That alliance is natural, he points out, when you look to see who gains from polluting, and who gets polluted. He makes the interesting observation that \"the Black Caucus . . . has the best voting record, year in and year out, on environmental issues of any interest group in Congress.\"\n\nIt's too bad that Mr. Shabecoff's courageous advice comes at the end of his book, not at the beginning, and that the early parts of the book are written in a plodding style that may not carry readers through to the end. Mr. Shabecoff admits that he is a journalist, not a historian. Until he gets to history that he himself witnessed, he does not make his story come alive. It's as if he were working through a list of names and ideas that need to be mentioned, describing each one dutifully, but rushing to get to the good stuff: the Reagan Administration and Anne Gorsuch Burford, the Bush promise and disappointment. He doesn't even tick off the history list in chronological order, so one can get confused about whether Barry Commoner might have been influenced by Rachel Carson or vice versa.\n\nThere is one more problem with this book, one that might have arisen from 14 years of environmental reporting under constant pressure to be objective. Mr. Shabecoff lets his bias loose in this book. Too loose. There are too many preachy sentences about \"the urbanized, overcivilized materialism that is engulfing late 20th-century America\" and about human beings having \"for the first time . . . the ability to make the world uninhabitable for their own species.\"\n\nIt would have been better to tell the story of the settlement and degradation of a glorious continent, of political corruption and senseless waste of resources and of the eloquent voices raised against that folly, and to let readers come to their own conclusions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-961993.html","abstract":"  Ngoc Lam and Que Lam Music of Vietnam Metropolitan Museum of Art    Vietnamese music, as played by Ngoc Lam and her daughter Que Lam on Sunday afternoon, is a sphere of pristine melodies, openwork counterpoint and an occasional delicate swirl.

Each tune, from his own complicated originals to \"Embraceable You\" and \"Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You,\" moved easily from lush, almost overripe chordal bursts to an austere formal mathematics in which a three- or four-note idea, running through permutations, slashed apart a piece's harmony.

Most of the actors graduated from the Juilliard School, where they presumably studied with Mr. Langham, until recently the head of its drama division. The result is a closer responsiveness between the performers and the director than is often found at Theater for a New Audience. The cast evokes memories of that earlier group of Juilliard graduates who became the charter members of the Acting Company.   In his distinguished career, Mr. Langham has staged a number of productions of \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" in England, at the Stratford Festival in Canada and at Juilliard. He is a master of the play's gently satiric humors. This time, he views the comedy as more autumnal than vernal. Russet colors dominate the palette in Douglas Stein's attractive set.

Her beheading still strikes terror into the hearts of those who witnessed the rise and empowerment of the Nazi regime, which reached its height of brutality in those days of 1943 and 1944, when its leaders realized the war was lost. Stalingrad had just become the nemesis of the Eastern front, and the air bombardment of German cities had begun, bringing home that the supposed invincibility of the German Reich was a myth.   Mildred Harnack-Fish, I presume, was married to the son of Dr. Adolf von Harnack, the theologian and humanist, once director general of the Prussian State Library and president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (after World War II, the Max Planck Institute). Adolf von Harnack was a scientist of great distinction, who represented the best of German culture and thinking. It is no wonder that in such an environment as the young Harnacks lived, Nazi ideology kindled active resistance.   Almost concurrent with Mildred Harnack-Fish's death, Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl, brother and sister students at the University of Munich, were executed at Stadelheim Prison in Munich. They and several more students and a professor were members of the White Rose, a secret society whose main sin had been to print and distribute leaflets and other material to appeal to the conscience of academic circles in Bavaria and to counter the lies of German victories on the many war fronts.    These young people, like the July 20, 1944, resistance group, were victims of the Volksgerichtshof (the People's court) under Judge Roland Freisler. All were condemned to death. Luckily for Freisler, he died in an air raid, instead of at the Nuremberg war crimes trials, where he belonged.

An overstaffed and grossly inefficient state was balanced by a dynamic and inventive private sector led by the likes of Fiat and Olivetti. While the former piled up debts and handed out patronage, the latter carved out an international reputation and kept the economy more or less buoyant.   It was not an ideal system. The lost mail, the useless factories and the general waste of time and money by the state cost the country dearly. But the system limped along, sustained by the endless elasticity of Italians. Now, however, the bribery and corruption scandal enveloping the nation has struck both the public and private sectors, undermining both and casting the country's future into doubt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Sports of The Times; Manhattan's Own Shining Moment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/sports/sports-of-the-times-manhattan-s-own-shining-moment.html","abstract":"  IT'S known as Manhattan College, but it's in the Bronx, a cluster of red-brick dorms and classrooms perched on a steep hill above Broadway among the now leafless trees of the Riverdale section.   \"All these stairs,\" one of its 3,600 students mentioned yesterday. \"That's why Manhattan has always had good track teams.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Amateur Is Delighted Taking Long Drives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/sports/golf-amateur-is-delighted-taking-long-drives.html","abstract":"  Even as Vicki Goetze has built a reputation as the finest American woman amateur golfer since Juli Inkster, she has been perceived as a weak hitter who must rely on short-game wizardry to be successful.

There are times in rock-and-roll when the visuals count. Elvis had his pompadour, Mick Jagger has his big lips; Iggy Pop of the Stooges had a skinny little body that he cut up with broken glass. The Mummies, a torturous garage band from San Francisco, has mummy costumes. Sometimes the four musicians wear tuxedos and bow ties over the mummy costumes, with space left just for their eyes and mouths; sometimes they mount mohawks on top of their mummified heads. Their raw, crass surf-punk is a beach party gone horror show, with primitive, distorted guitar, shrieked vocals and the ever-present shatter of bludgeoned cymbals. But how much finesse can you expect from a band of guys wrapped head to foot in bandage strips? Tomorrow night's show at CBGB with the Swingin' Neckbreakers, Vacant Lot and Supercharger starts at 9:30; admission is $8. Sunday's show at Maxwell's with Supercharger starts at 9 P.M.; admission is $7. Voices of the City    Television, Academy, 234 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 249-8870. A secret history of New York City is written in Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine's guitars: gray afternoons on the Lower East Side, dark nights at CBGB, an epoch of shadowy moments before and after the punk explosion of 1977. In the glory days, Television released two beautiful albums, \"Marquee Moon\" in 1977 and \"Adventure\" in 1978, then splintered. But Mr. Lloyd never stopped playing guitar and Mr. Verlaine never stopped writing words, and the group reunited last year for a new album, \"Television.\" The spare, desolate guitar notes in songs like \"1880 or So\" and \"Rhyme\" are the sound of a place nobody wants, the story of a city's forgotten voices. Show time is Sunday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $19.50 in advance or $21 at the door.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"2 CALIFORNIA BASES SPARED FROM LIST OF MILITARY CUTS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/us/2-california-bases-spared-from-list-of-military-cuts.html","abstract":"  Throwing a bone to California, an economically depressed and politically crucial state, Defense Secretary Les Aspin has decided to spare two military installations there that had been on the armed services' list of those that should close, senior Pentagon officials said today.

The cool professionalism of a master tailor like Armani is always a pleasure. He did not bother to tinker with proportions or decorations. Jackets just slid over the body in a gently fitted line, accompanied most often with easy, comfortable-looking trousers. Colors were mild, with the emphasis on honey shades and light browns. Traditional patterns like checks and herringbones had a pale subtlety. Occasionally, a short vest with a rounded hem peeped from under a jacket. A massive necklace was sometimes worn on the chest, but there was no other jewelry, not even earrings. It was simply the apotheosis of the pants suit as the basic daytime look for the woman of today.  Doing What Works Well    The designer tried a few long, full skirts with his well-cut jackets, and they seemed to work well.

The often compelling, sometimes revelatory exhibition of Ernst's early years at the Museum of Modern Art, the first major examination of the artist's work to be held in New York City in nearly 20 years, confirms the German-born Surrealist as an astoundingly inventive, even protean artist.   Beginning with two derivative yet beautifully colored Cubo-Futurist compositions and several examples of a touchingly sweet, emotionally dark Expressionism, the show follows Ernst's rapid development from 1912 to 1927 through 170 works in painting, drawing, prints and most of all collage. A pioneer of Dada and Surrealism, Ernst helped divert Cubist collage, which was implictly abstract, into Dadaist territory in 1919, fusing unrelated images into recognizable yet hauntingly unfamiliar realities. Inspired by the dreamscape that Giorgio de Chirico opened for exploration just before World War I, Ernst then began converting these collages into paintings that helped form the basis of Surrealism, the art movement that his friend Andre Breton erected on the ashes of Dada in Paris in 1924. Without the monumental hybrid creatures of Ernst's 1921 paintings \"Celebes\" and \"Ubu Imperator,\" without the mutant plants and jewel colors of his stratified collage landscapes or the reconstituted academic figuration of \"The Tottering Woman,\" with its machine-clad 19th-century circus performer seen against a crystalline blue Northern Renaissance sky, the Surrealist work of Magritte, Dali and Tanguy is virtually unimaginable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"House, Like Senate, Votes To Ban H.I.V.

He ordered the city to place this group in rooms with four or fewer people where beds are at least eight feet apart, and said the city must also provide them with quarters that have adequate ventilation and separate bathrooms and dining areas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"What the Directors Wanted You to See","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/arts/what-the-directors-wanted-you-to-see.html","abstract":"  Directors' cuts of high-profile feature films, which are a video-disk staple, are making their way to videotape.

Meyer, in \"The Roots of Bosnia's Anguish\" (Editorial Notebook, Feb. 28), approvingly cites Rebecca West's \"Black Lamb and Gray Falcon.\" Dame Rebecca contended that, were it not for the Roman Catholic Church's intolerance to the neo-Manichean Bogomils, a heretical sect that had a considerable following in Bosnia, the Ottoman Turks would not have managed to gain a foothold in Europe for five centuries.   But the incursions of the Hungarian rulers to subjugate an emerging Bosnian state had little to do with its religious peculiarities and would likely have occurred anyway. Moreover, the Bogomil ruler, Hrvoje Vukcic-Hrvatinic, responsible for inviting the Turks to help him repel the Hungarian ruler Sigmund, was on very friendly terms with the Catholics in and outside his realm. A Catholic missal that the local Franciscans dedicated to him is one of Croatia's most revered cultural treasures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"The Ones You Never Saw in a Movie Theater","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/movies/the-ones-you-never-saw-in-a-movie-theater.html","abstract":"  If you stumble across a recent video that you've never heard of, there's probably a good reason.

A few warning signals can help you avoid those movies too terrible to be seen in public. Be wary of any package that doesn't contain a single quotation from a critic; even a story about backgammon players in the Rockies could find someone who said \"DAZZLING scenery!!!\" Another telltale sign is the presence of aliens in the plot.

Last week the British advertising magnate went on a shopping spree. The day before an exhibition opened at the Anderson O'Day Gallery in West London, Mr. Saatchi bought out the entire show, five abstract paintings by an unknown 32-year-old British artist named Simon Callery. The works were priced at $:4,000 and $:5,000 each, and Prue O'Day, an owner of the gallery, said Mr. Saatchi spent $:20,000, or about $29,000. Mr. Saatchi first saw Mr. Callery's work a month before, at a new artist's space near King's Cross in London called Cubitt Street Studios, where he bought an abstract landscape painting.   Such sprees are nothing new for Mr. Saatchi. But just as fast as he buys many works by a single artist, he has been known to sell them, sending prices on a rapid roller-coaster ride. This fickle behavior is a subject of great interest to gallery owners, artists, auction-house experts and collectors, who keep close tabs on Mr. Saatchi's dealings because he has been known to inflate an artist's reputation and then deflate it in short order, all single-handed. For example, in the 1980's Mr. Saatchi bought, in bulk, the work of the Italian artist Sandro Chia, and then, shortly after, he sold the work and Mr. Chia's prices tumbled. They have never quite recovered.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"How Many Sexes Are There?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/how-many-sexes-are-there.html","abstract":"  Western culture is committed to the idea that there are only two sexes.

Legally, too, every adult is either man or woman, and the difference is not trivial. It means being available for, or exempt from, draft registration, as well as being subject to laws governing marriage, the family and human intimacy.   But if the state and the legal system have an interest in maintaining a two-party sexual system, they are defying nature. For biologically speaking, there are many gradations running from female to male; along that spectrum lie at least five sexes -- perhaps even more.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"Restaurants; In Morningside Heights, quality outrides many changes.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/arts/restaurants-in-morningside-heights-quality-outrides-many-changes.html","abstract":"  The Terrace restaurant, high above 119th Street at Columbia University in Morningside Heights, seemed a likely victim for the harsh recent recession.

Impersonating most of the movie's characters, from the Wicked Witch of the West to the Munchkins, they turn the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel (59 West 44th Street, Manhattan), where they are appearing through March 27, into a nostalgic time capsule. The medley is so exhaustive it even includes \"The Jitterbug,\" a song that was dropped from the movie. It culminates in an elaborate, semi-barbershop arrangement of \"Over the Rainbow,\" sung a cappella with a recorded chorus of their own voices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"'We're Just Devastated'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/us/we-re-just-devastated.html","abstract":"  The man claiming responsibility for the slaying of an abortion provider has led an unstable life in recent years, relatives say.

Perhaps the association comes to mind simply because \"Touchbase\" was first performed last year in London by the Rambert Dance Company, a British troupe, and because the work's designer is Mark Lancaster, the British artist and former Cunningham artistic adviser who now lives in England again.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"Trade Center Blast Raises Crowding Questions; Making a Smoke Filter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/l-trade-center-blast-raises-crowding-questions-making-a-smoke-filter-863093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The Feb. 26 events at the World Trade Center bring back old memories. I was in the MGM Grand Hotel when it burned in 1980. It is likely that 84 of the 85 people who died there might have lived if they had done what I did.   I walked down 10 flights of stairs, through thick, acrid smoke. But it could have been 110 flights, because I made a wet breathing filter for myself. I took a towel, wet it and wrapped it around my head (to leave my hands free) and draped an end over my head (against flame and falling embers). Some smoke got through, but the filter worked well enough to let me make an orderly descent with my belongings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"Historical Society Tries To Live by Subtraction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/arts/historical-society-tries-to-live-by-subtraction.html","abstract":"  A plan to rescue the financially troubled New-York Historical Society from the brink of dissolution was embraced by the institution's trustees Wednesday, it was announced at a news conference at the society yesterday morning.

You overlook a crucial fact: workers often wait to file because they cannot afford to live off the paltry benefits.   In New York State, for example, the maximum benefit for a total disability (for example, paralysis, advanced lung-disease) is two-thirds of a worker's average weekly wage, up to $400 a week, or $20,800 annually. But only 2 percent of compensation claims are for total disabilities -- the rest are for partial disabilities, for which workers generally receive significantly less money.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"Military Industry Lobbies to Preserve Status Quo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/us/military-industry-lobbies-to-preserve-status-quo.html","abstract":"  While President Clinton unveiled his program today to retrain workers displaced by cuts in Pentagon spending, the nation's big military contractors were lobbying to keep their businesses intact.
