Such are the vagaries of opening-night galas. This one consisted of three separate acts, from three separate operas, united by one theme: the power of the two tenors playing the three roles, who happen to be among the most renowned voices of their generation. The two tenors, in case anybody has missed the best-selling recordings and videos and a generation of hype and well-deserved praise, were Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti (in alphabetical order, to avoid any possible ruffled feathers in their long-term rivalry). Mr. Domingo has the leaner, more pointed voice, able to take on more robust roles in the dramatic category with intelligence and skill; Mr. Pavarotti has had the fleshier, more extroverted (and possibly more popular) instrument, preferring a narrower repertory focused largely on the lyric roles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930929","headline":"How Demand Surged for Prostate Test","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/29/health/how-demand-surged-for-prostate-test.html","abstract":"  DR.

The under-representation of minorities in jury pools is also wrong. That happens because prospective jurors' names are taken from three lists that do not represent the whole population: registered voters, licensed drivers and the state's mailing list of taxpayers.

If he offered too few hints about his own intentions, that's understandable. Stuck with an unpopular (and inherited) operation in Somalia, and still groping with the foggy complexities in Bosnia, Mr. Clinton is hardly the only American who is wary about ever-expanding peacekeeping operations.    Just six years ago, he reminded the General Assembly, there were only 10,000 peacekeepers. That force has now grown to an overstretched blue-helmeted army of 80,000, deployed in 17 operations on four continents. Few would dispute Mr. Clinton's cautionary conclusion: \"If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping, the U.N. must know when to say no.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930929","time":"1993-09-29

advanced to the second round of the European Champions Cup last night in less-than-impressive form. A crowd of 40,000 whistled at San Siro Stadium in Italy as Milan played a scoreless tie against the Swiss champion, FC Aarau, and advanced, 1-0, on aggregate in the home-and-home series. United, in its first home game in the Champions Cup at Old Trafford in 24 years, beat Honved Kispest of Hungary, 2-1, on a pair of goals by Steve Bruce and advanced, 5-3, on aggregate. On a night when 43 European games were played, all five Italian teams advanced. Joining AC Milan were Torino in the Cup Winners Cup and Cagliari, Inter Milan and Lazio in the U.E.F.A. Cup. Scottish champion Glasgow Rangers, which won the first leg at home, 3-2, allowed Nikolai Todarov to score in the final minute, giving Levski Sofia a 2-1 victory and sending the Bulgarians into the next round on away goals. The Spanish champion, Barcelona, led by a pair of goals from Jose Maria Bakero, beat Dinamo Kiev of Ukraine, 4-1, and advanced, 5-4, on aggregate.

The Nets have 15 days after receiving the offer sheet to match it, or they will lose Schintzius to Milwaukee.   \"I guess right now, Dwayne's sort of in limbo, playing for the Milwaukee Nets,\" said Frank Martin of Pro-Exec, Schintzius's agent, who spoke from his car phone on his way to deliver the offer sheet to the Nets yesterday afternoon. \"I don't know if the Nets will match or not, but we're delighted for Dwayne. It's a good offer.\" The Whys Have It    What made Milwaukee pursue a center who played in only 10 games last season and who has a career 3.4 scoring average? There are several factors. Schintzius is 7 feet 2 inches, he turns 25 years old next month, he has ability and the rebuilding Bucks need a young center. Schintzius's work ethic has been the big question mark during his three-year professional career. But he was impressive during summer-league play, and he showed a willingness to improve by attending Pete Newell's Big Man's Camp in Hawaii. Seven-footers with talent are not plentiful, and the Bucks are willing to take a chance on Schintzius.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930930","headline":"New Proposal Would Automatically Limit Secrecy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/30/us/new-proposal-would-automatically-limit-secrecy.html","abstract":"  Trying to establish a post-cold-war policy for classifying Government documents, the Clinton Administration is considering a proposal intended to give the public easier access to sensitive information but still allow officials considerable discretion to withhold some secrets.

While shaking is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. Deeper earthquakes also have less interaction with the surface, and their energy is spread out across a larger volume.

Eleven inspectors were arrested yesterday when they reported to the Buildings Department for what they had been told would be a computer training session. Colleagues looked on in disbelief as the inspectors were taken away about 9:30 A.M. One plumbing inspector who was not arrested said the city was partly responsible for the problem.   \"They create it,\" the inspector said. \"They put you in a position that basically is a no-win situation. They don't give you any increase in salary. Plumbers are making $55,000 a year and the city plumbing inspectors only get $28,000.\" Payoffs at 88 Work Sites    The inspectors, responsible for insuring that pipes, sprinklers and gas lines are safe in buildings being constructed or under renovation, were accused of taking dozens of payoffs and bribes from contractors since 1988, ranging from $50 to $1,000. Prosecutors said they had evidence of payoffs at 88 work sites, including Police Headquarters, the World Trade Center, a condominium development on Staten Island and a row of three-family houses in Queens.    For the bribes, prosecutors said, the inspectors speeded approvals for plumbing work, arranging special appointments for inspections and taking pains to make sure the paper work was done quickly. Because plumbing contractors are generally not paid until their work passes inspection, the contractors were willing to make illegal payments just to speed up the city bureaucracy, prosecutors said.   \"These city inspectors were demanding payoffs to insure that their official duties were performed expeditiously,\" said the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau. \"Their power to extort payoffs lay in the fact that their signatures made the difference between getting paid or not getting paid.\"   The city's Investigation Commissioner, Susan E. Shepard, portrayed the bribes as part of endemic corruption in the plumbing industry. She said plumbing contractors had come to expect that they would have to pay cash bribes to get city inspections done on time and without hassles. Since the plumbing inspectors are required to be licensed plumbers, most come from the companies they regulate, creating a cozy breeding ground for corruption, she said. 'A Real Fraternity'    \"There is a real fraternity here,\" she said. \"A fraternity that practices corruption almost as an art form. Corruption so deeply ingrained it has become common practice. No guns pointed. No strong-arm enforcement. People pay. The contractor gets his sign-off. The job continues. Everyone smiles.\"   About half of the city's 38 plumbing investigators were arrested in the sweep yesterday, crippling the department's ability to perform inspections. In addition to 11 inspectors arrested at the department's headquarters, one was arrested at his office and five others were still being sought. Six retired inspectors were arrested at their homes.   It was not the first time that corruption has cropped up in a building inspection program. In 1991, a similar investigation resulted in the arrest of 14 construction inspectors in the Buildings Department on Federal charges of extorting more than $150,000 over a three-year period from contractors. In 1992, city investigators arrested 30 taxi inspectors at the city's cab inspection center in Queens on charges that they accepted bribes to pass unsafe taxis.   The inspectors arrested yesterday were charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, extortion, receiving bribes and receiving unlawful gratuities. The most serious charge, grand larceny, carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.    Ms. Shepard said the 18-month inquiry uncovered no evidence that the inspectors overlooked or approved work that would create hazards.   Among those indicted were the chief plumbing inspectors for Queens and Brooklyn and the acting chief inspector in Manhattan, Ms. Shepard said. The chiefs were paid between $300 and $500 per inspection and in a single instance, $1,000, for a fast approval, augmenting their income by as much as $25,000 a year, she said. The assistant inspectors and line inspectors were collecting about $5,000 a year in illegal payments, she said.   Mayor David N. Dinkins said he had submitted two bills to the City Council that would replace city-paid inspectors with private inspectors supervised by a board of city officials. He also said the Buildings Department had taken some steps to discourage corruption: computerizing inspection schedules to make sure the sites are visited within three days after a request and rotating inspectors from borough to borough to break down personal relationships with plumbing contractors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931001","headline":"Welfare Fingerprinting Becomes Law in Suffolk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/nyregion/welfare-fingerprinting-becomes-law-in-suffolk.html","abstract":"  Despite possible state opposition, Suffolk County Executive Robert J.

Giuliani, followed by a series of unflattering black and white photos of Mr. Giuliani. As a male narrator's voice is heard over ominous music, blocks of text scroll on the screen repeating his words. At the end, a final question freezes on the screen, with a big picture of Mr. Giuliani and a small picture of Mayor David N. Dinkins, noting his campaign paid for the ad. PRODUCER   Doak Shrum Harris Carrier Devine of Washington. THE SCRIPT   Narrator: \"He was the third-highest official in Washington of the Reagan Justice Department that led an attack on the environment, tried to overturn a woman's right to choose, and turn back the clock on civil rights. He opposed banning cop killer bullets, waffled on gun control, and supported Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. As U.S. Attorney in New York, of the 146 people he hired, only 15 were Latino or black. He was accused of abuse of power, and Federal courts rebuked his conduct. Rudolph Giuliani: Can we elect a man who's fought against everything we stand for. ACCURACY   Mr. Giuliani was the Associate Attorney General, the No. 3 post in Justice, in the early Regan Administration, and the department was widely criticized on the issues the ad cites. In 1983, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee against a ban on armor-piercing bullets, arguing that it was impossible to cover all kinds capable of penetrating a bullet-proof vest \"without being overinclusive,\" and proposed instead mandatory five-year sentences for the use of such bullets in the commission of Federal crimes. In 1981, he called proposed gun-control laws that would impose waiting periods for handgun purchases \"sensible and moderate\" but more recently has said gun control laws are not especially effective. Roughly 10 percent of the laywers Mr. Giuliani hired as United States Attorney in Manhattan were black or Hispanic, comparable to the hiring in the city's Law Department at the time but roughly one-third the average level of hiring there since Mr. Dinkins took office. Many defense lawyers accused Mr. Giuliani of excessive zeal in his years as United States Attorney, Federal judges several times cited him or his office for \"overzealousness\" and some of his most celebrated prosecutions ended in acquittals or reversals on appeal. SCORECARD   This ad, unusually pointed for a low-key politician like Mr. Dinkins, is part of his campaign's continuing effort to paint Mr. Giuliani as a hard-hearted Reaganaut, unyielding and out of step with the liberal swing voters who are likely to help decide the election. It spans issues that have long been liberal touchstones. Virtually all the stands it cites predated the 1989 mayoral campaign, and were issues four years ago, but the Mayor's camp argues that Mr. Giuliani's record is little known or understood by most New Yorkers and must be attacked. The intent of the ad is to make the whole of Mr. Giuliani's sometimes shifting stands greater than the sum of its parts, though voters may find some of his past positions only marginally relevant to the next Mayor's job.

The investigation was started in March 1992, during the run of \"Catskills on Broadway.\"   In a letter made public yesterday, the District Attorney's Office said that despite evidence that $200,000 had been stolen, \"we were not able to develop legally sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt who committed the crime.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931001","headline":"Critic's Notebook; A No-Apologies Woman for the 90's: Harlow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/movies/critic-s-notebook-a-no-apologies-woman-for-the-90-s-harlow.html","abstract":"  JEAN HARLOW represented everything that straitlaced 1930's America was supposed to despise. She played platinum-haired prostitutes, gold diggers and other trashy types with no apologies. In \"Red-Headed Woman,\" she strategically places a picture of her rich, married boss under her garter and says, \"It'll get me more there than it will hanging on the wall.\" In \"Red Dust,\" she decides to take a bath in a rain barrel, the better to get Clark Gable's attention. And in \"Hold Your Man,\" she fights a rival for Gable's affections by belting the other woman with a left to the jaw, twice. Yet in her seven-year career, Harlow was wildly popular with both men and women, who found more to envy than to scorn.   The Harlow retrospective that begins today at the Film Forum is a vastly entertaining reminder of a brief and fascinating career, one that ended when Harlow died of kidney failure in 1937, at 26. And the series suggests something more. Harlow's garishly dyed hair, pencil-thin eyebrows and heavy eye makeup mark her as a sex symbol left over from the day before yesterday. Yet in film after film she sails into the present carrying along her most prized and timeless possessions: a clear conscience and a sense of humor. Harlow was an exaggerated symbol of what middle-class America wouldn't dare embrace in real life: sex without guilt. In the AIDS-aware 90's, the allure of that persona and the wit with which she brought it off hit with the fresh force they must have had five decades ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931001","headline":"Colin Powell, Who Led U.S. Military Into a New Era, Resigns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/us/colin-powell-who-led-us-military-into-a-new-era-resigns.html","abstract":"  Gen. Colin L. Powell, who defined the United States' post-cold-war military doctrine, retired today as popular with America's armed forces as with the average American who never served in harm's way.   That appeal, which has drawn speculation that the final chapter in General Powell's soldier-statesman career may yet be written in the White House, derives from his commitment to the armed services as well as to his stature as the first black to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931001","headline":"Home Video","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/arts/home-video-548393.html","abstract":"  To promote three recent hits, and to frustrate video pirates, Paramount opens a window -- wide.

Lawyers for some of the surviving Branch Davidians were quick to predict that the Treasury review's general depiction of Government failures, confusion and lies would bolster the Branch Davidians' case that bullets fired by cult members during the shootout came in self-defense.

Established as a writer of novels, short stories and plays, Mr. Thomas became a television celebrity in the 1960's on the BBC talk show \"The Brains Trust.\" That's when this dramatization begins, with Anthony Hopkins grumblingly playing the wittily provocative Thomas. \"All writers are liars,\" he declares, explaining that the lie is a compulsory social tactic. Then, with Hopkins assuming the role of narrator, the story goes back to Thomas's adolescence in South Wales.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19931001","time":"1993-10-01
