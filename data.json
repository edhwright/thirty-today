The question of how the parts fit together is asked over and over on a number of levels. In the case of Emanuel Ax, Isaac Stern, Jaime Laredo and Yo-Yo Ma, who played quartets for piano and strings at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday, one began with the strong personalities: how four visible soloists with egos agree on matters of how fast, how loud, how legato or non-legato.   There is also the balance of instrumental skills. Though his sense of style remains impressive, Mr. Stern's violin sound is not as strong as it once was. These players have adjusted with great skill, and with evident enthusiasm and respect.

Ms. Kagan, a pianist, musicologist and critic, is the world's leading authority on the Archduke. She has written an extraordinarily thorough study of his music for Pendragon Press and recorded the Violin Sonata with Mr. Suk for the Koch International label.

But representatives of the film industry in New York say restrictions by the Transit Authority smack of censorship and could harm the health of the city's film industry, which spent $1.3 billion in the five boroughs in 1992. Contrary to Reality?    \"We've been very successful in the last two or three years in reducing violence and increasing ridership.\" said Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman. \"We want to protect our investment and increase ridership.

These exhibitions can create the illusion of broader horizons for the visitor, no mean task in a February like this one, enabling one to traverse a great deal of esthetic terrain in a relatively small amount of space and a minimum of weather. They provide momentary respite from winter's doldrums, when the vision narrows and the mind hunkers down.   In SoHo and on 57th Street there are shows with three or more artists at nearly every turn, in young galleries and blue-chip venues alike. Some focus on one medium; others have a thematic or formal organizing device. Most are in-house efforts, organized by dealers happy to take a break from the steady march of one-person exhibitions; a few bear the imprimatur of independent curators. And one or two even push the envelope of the group show format, suggesting that it can be a provocative art form in itself.  Paula Cooper    \"Pictures of the Real World (In Real Time),\" at the Paula Cooper Gallery (155 Wooster Street, near Houston Street), is an oddly handsome show, organized by Robert Nickas, that measures life and photography, constancy and change. The constants are the austere Conceptual Art date paintings of On Kawara, which here are something akin to wall labels. Announcing dates like \"May 6, 1972\" or \"June 9, 1985,\" these small white-on-black canvases mark off the 28 years of 1966 to 1993 and alternate with 28 photographs, one from each year.   The show's main achievement, other than to give Mr. Kawara's paintings somethings to do, is to trace photography into Conceptual Art and out the other side. It begins with Conceptualists like Dan Graham and Douglas Huebler, includes appropriation artists like Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince and Sherrie Levine and concludes with more idiosyncratic manipulators of the medium like Andres Serrano, Jeanne Dunning and Zoe Leonard. Documentary photographs, primarily by Larry Clark and Diane Arbus, are definitely in the minority. Yet in many ways, reality and how artists with cameras have insinuated it into art are the show's underlying subjects. (Through March 12.) Luhring Augustine    By its very title, \"The Ossuary,\" at Luhring Augustine (130 Prince Street), evokes two of contemporary art's most prevalent subjects: death and the body. The show, which has been organized by Diego Cortez and Arto Lindsay, brings together 26 artists, many of them the usual suspects, like Edward Ruscha, Brice Marden and Philip Taaffe, all intersecting with the show's theme from different angles and tangents. Richard Prince for example, contributes a joke painting about a funeral.   Included are \"Jawbone,\" a powerful, uncharacteristically wordless painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, and an exceptional four-panel painting by Francesco Clemente in which a seemingly living face is progressively readied for burial, winding up dead. But the show's main action is sculptural: impressive objects by Louise Bourgeois, Kiki Smith, Matthew Barney and, most startlingly, a Brazilian Candomble priest named Mestre Didi, create a garden of earthly delights centerstage. (Through March 19.) Jay Gorney    The exhibition at Jay Gorney (100 Greene Street, near Prince Street) includes works by the painter David Deutsch, the photographer James Welling and Douglas Blau, a critic, curator and expert image-gatherer who is giving appropriation art a few new twists. Mr. Deutsch's painting of a small town glimpsed through the lush overgrowth of summer trees plays off the starker realities of Mr. Welling's black-and-white photographs of old houses whose weathered exteriors and hillside settings immediately evoke the harshness of mining-town life.   In the other direction, Mr. Deutsch's \"Double Plaza\" and \"Repository,\" in which pantheons of blurry portraits invoke a rather daunting sense of cultural authority, are relieved by Mr. Blau's \"Views and Vistas.\" This work of 81 found images from sources high and low and ranging through several centuries, concentrates on isolated figures seen from the back, looking at landscapes. After Mr. Deutsch's generic evocations of human achievement, it's nice to see man and woman dwarfed by nature. (Through March 26.) Postmasters    \"Untitled,\" the group show at Postmasters (80 Greene Street, near Spring Street), presents work by five women and reminds us that, contrary to the impression created by the current exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, abstract artists, too, can be \"Bad Girls.\" All it takes is irreverence, a certain raunchiness of style or material and a healthy disregard for the lines between media. Beth Haggart constructs a huge, truculent yet buoyant sphere from cardboard boxes, while Polly Apfelbaum states the colors of the spectrum in radiant terms on strips of white velvet arranged neatly on the floor.   In an especially beautiful work that recalls the early 1970's poured-latex paintings of Lynda Benglis, Lauren Szold creates an in-progress piece of Process Art by swirling color across the floor and letting it drip from the ceiling. Nancy Rubins's rugged graphite drawings and Jessica Stockholder's bristling found-object formalism complete this impressive gathering. (Through March 19.) P.P.O.W.    \"Arabesque,\" at P.P.O.W. (532 Broadway, near Spring Street), follows the curving, undulating and occasionally curlicue lines of arabesques from artwork to artwork, which are good, bad and indifferent and mostly paintings. It gets credit for emphasizing the decorative in art of all kinds, be it the political surrealism of Frank Moore's painting \"Easter,\" with its spiral of blood, or the intimate heraldic shapes of David Moreno's untitled abstract collage.   In Lari Pittman's ferociously decorative \"Untitled No. 4 (Insist),\" the decorative and the political fuse seamlessly. Also engaging are the works of Betsy Friedman, Amy Sillman, Fred Tomaselli, Gregory Crane and Peter Nagy, who has abandoned his black and white palette for pastels. And the overall ambiance of this show -- bright, formally exuberant and, well, a little loopy -- is a pleasant change of pace. (Through March 19.) Lennon, Weinberg    \"An Exhibition in Memory of Raoul Hague,\" at Lennon, Weinberg (580 Broadway, near Prince Street), is a touching meditation on the artist's quest. It brings together six sculptures by Raoul Hague, who died last year at the age of 88, with three or four drawings or paintings each by Arshile Gorky, Bradley Walker Tomlin and Philip Guston, all of whom Hague claimed as friends and inspirers. Each artist's progress toward abstraction and an individual style is briefly indicated, starting with Tomlin's \"Tulip,\" a lovely little painting from 1930, and ending with Guston's lumpily sensuous \"Afternoon II\" of 1963.   Especially noteworthy is Hague's \"Belgian Marble,\" a 1940 sculpture of a standing female nude whose simplified forms reflect the artist's studies with William Zorach and John Flannagan. The figure's face is awkwardly schematized and its arms are poorly resolved, but the abbreviated yet gently swelling torso achieves a balance between the real and the abstract and between flesh and stone that is completely riveting. (Through tomorrow.) Thread Waxing Space    In \"Don't Look Now\" at Thread Waxing Space (476 Broadway, near Broome Street), the critic Joshua Decter creates a picture gallery that is also a slide show. In the process he demonstrates the appeal that strictly limited formats hold for curators. Mr. Decter invited 68 artists (and a few writers) to submit any work they wanted so long as it was in slide form. All are projected high on the walls of a dark narrow space, in alphabetical order.   Some artists simply sent slides of their work. Others, like Jon Kessler, who turned his slide into a work of kinetic art, have bent the format to their particular sensibilities. For some, no bending was necessary. The self-absorbed Sean Landers sent a childhood photograph, while Robert Gober is represented by a slide of an early painting from a work that consists entirely of slides of no-longer-extant early paintings. This show may be a critic's revenge on the art object, or an aside about art in the age of mechanical reproduction. But it's also great fun, perhaps in spite of itself. (Through tomorrow.) Galerie St. Etienne    Not all the artists in \"The Forgotten Folk Art of the 1940's,\" at Galerie St. Etienne (24 West 57th Street), deserve to be remembered. It doesn't seem necessary, for example, to retrieve from obscurity the sentimental, heavy-handed canvases of Abraham Levin or Lawrence Lebduska, although the latter comported himself quite well when painting fish and cactuses on small wood panels. The show is further weakened by poor examples of artists who aren't all that forgotten, like John Kane; and by so many similar snow scenes by Grandma Moses that the term cottage industry gains new meaning.   Still, it's great to see Israel Litwak's dense little landscapes in which careful patterns make every leaf and flower stand out. Also worthy of rediscovery are the paintings of Grandma Moses' younger brother, Fred Robertson, who took up the brush after his sister's success. Sibling rivalry is clearly as effective as any other artistic motivation: at least in this context, Robertson's less meticulous, more emotional landscapes and farm scenes outshine the efforts of his famous sister. (Through March 19.)  Barbara Mathes    The twain that meet in \"Alternative Visions\" at the Barbara Mathes Gallery (41 East 57th Street) are 19th-century French wallpaper and 20th-century Minimal Art, realms of artistic endeavor so disparate that one doesn't even think of them as opposites.   The meeting is more a miss than a hit, partly because many visitors to contemporary art galleries may find the wallpaper designs so unfamiliar and striking, especially in their unusual, often intense color combinations, that the efforts of Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Robert Ryman and Carl Andre may simply be overlooked. There's shared territory: an emphasis on repeating forms and at times a chalky surface delicacy. But the show's only real click is the juxtaposition of three scenic panels and a stripe painting by Agnes Martin, which share a similar grisaille color scheme and sense of restraint. Otherwise, it's a nice try, with the wallpaper doing most of the work. (Through April 2.)

Available from Descarga, 328 Flatbush Avenue, Suite 180, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11238; information: (800) 377-2647. Salsa is a music ruled by its formulas, by the overwhelming power of record companies and their marketing ideas. That isn't always bad: it makes musicians write melodies and work on songs. The commercial pressure has also produced a whole tradition of descarga records, jam-session recordings that allow the musicians to stretch out, usually showing their love for jazz. This is an ambitious two-CD set, does exactly that, letting the musicians have some say. The opening track, nearly 16 minutes long, is the sort of heated, improvised performance that's heard regularly in clubs but rarely on records. The rest of the album features all sorts of music, from pop salsa tracks to a chant for the santeria saint Elegba, from a long homage to the great Cuban bassist and composer Cachao to a few instrumental pieces.

It seems that receiver Chris Burkett's retirement on Wednesday was a pre-emptive move by the player to keep the team from releasing him or trimming his $1.075 million salary for the 1994 season. He earned $925,000 last season.   Dick Steinberg, the Jets' general manager, said they never asked Burkett, 31, to take a pay cut. Instead, Steinberg said they had a general discussion about what the team wanted to do with older players who had high yearly salaries in an effort to make room under the salary cap to sign other players. Those options included having their contracts restructured or being waived and brought back at a lower salary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940225","headline":"TVWeekend; Of a Black's Struggle at West Point in the 1880's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/25/movies/tvweekend-of-a-black-s-struggle-at-west-point-in-the-1880-s.html","abstract":"  In 1880, a West Point Cadet, Johnson C. Whittaker, was brutally attacked by three masked men in his dormitory room and left on the floor, bleeding profusely while tied to his bed. Whittaker, a 21-year-old black man, accused three of his more racist fellow students. West Point adminstrators chose to believe their explanation that Whittaker had staged the attack himself because he was afraid of failing a philosophy course. Whittaker was found guilty in a court-martial and dismissed from West Point.   The story is reconstructed in \"Assault at West Point,\" having its premiere Sunday on Showtime. An older Whittaker (Al Freeman Jr.), now battling bigots who don't want him and his family living in a white Oklahoma City neighborhood, tells his story to a local journalist. The flashback begins as Whittaker's lawyers, the white Daniel Chamberlain (Sam Waterston) and the black Richard Greener (Samuel L. Jackson), prepare their case for the aggrieved cadet (Seth Gilliam).

February has been a month of significant beginnings for George Shearing, a British-born pianist whose first professional job -- playing an old upright piano in a London pub -- began on Feb. 25, 1936, when he was 16. He discovered the quintet sound that made him famous while recording \"September in the Rain\" on Feb. 17, 1948; it featured vibraharp (Margie Hyams), guitar (Chuck Wayne) and Shearing's adaptation of Milt Buckner's locked-hand piano style, in which the two hands, closely aligned, span an octave. Mr. Shearing finally escaped this sound in 1978 by dropping the quintet and forming a duo with Neil Swainson on bass. The duo shares this weekend's program with Kenny Burrell's Trio, in which Mr. Burrell joined by the bassist Marcus McLaurine and the drummer Sherman Ferguson. Shows are at 9 and 11:30 tonight, tomorrow and Sunday. There is a $25 cover and $5 minimum at tables, or $15 admission to the bar area. JOHN S.

However, Rabbi Hertzberg fails to note that even within the pre-1967 borders of Israel this same disparity of birth rates, associated with a declining Aliyah, assures Israel of an Arab majority in Israel (70 years?) unless steps are taken to prevent this from occurring. Ceding the \"West Bank\" to the \"Palestinians\" would, therefore, not solve the problem which Rabbi Hertzberg raises; it would serve only to further jeopardize Israel's security and betray a Biblical trust.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940226","headline":"In Response to Spy Case, U.S. Expels Diplomat Russians Refused to Recall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/26/us/in-response-to-spy-case-us-expels-diplomat-russians-refused-to-recall.html","abstract":"  The United States expelled a senior Russian diplomat today after Moscow refused to withdraw him in atonement for its possible role in employing a Central Intelligence Agency officer who was arrested on espionage charges this week.

Now, 14 days later, she was cradling the sleeping infant to her breast and talking of the loss of her man and the glory of her child.   \"Have I cried?\" said the woman in her basement apartment in Woodhaven, Queens. \"No, not much. In the last two months of my pregnancy I knew I had to concentrate on keeping calm. I didn't want to pass any nervousness on to the baby. I had to be strong so she wouldn't be colicky or troubled.\"   Her daughter, Bianca Alexis, slept peacefully beneath a tapestry of Marilyn Monroe. She has a well-formed face with thick brown hair that has a little red in it, like her mother's. If she grows up to look like her mother she will be a beautiful woman. \"She has her daddy's lips,\" Ms. Gonzalez said, pointing to the photograph of Alexander Ortiz, the man who was shot as they walked back to this apartment from the movies on Nov. 26, three days before his 23d birthday.   She has not repressed the details of what happened that night. She remembers the two men coming toward them. The shot that knocked Alex down. The second shot as she fumbled with buttons to remove her three-year-old shearling coat. She remembers how after the killers fled into a white car, Alex, bleeding on the sidewalk, had told her he was scared. \"I told him to pray and he said he didn't know how. He hadn't been raised in church. I hugged him and prayed.\"      She also remembers how some police officers and some friends and relatives had assumed the gunmen were black. \"Why did they say that? The killers were my own kind. They were Spanish. You know there's plenty of bad in all kinds of people.\" Several times since then she has been at the spot where Alex was killed. It is a shopping area and it is hard to avoid, but in any case, going there did not fill her with dread. \"I am not scared living here. This is not a bad neighborhood. What happened could have happened anywhere from Park Avenue to Florida.\"    She has written down her memories in a letter she plans to give her daughter on her 16th birthday. She wrote how in the seventh month of pregnancy she had gone to the hospital to identify Alex. How she had hugged his body there and later in the morgue. She described how she went home and did his laundry, laying out socks and underwear in drawers where they still remain.   Sometimes, as she waited for birth, she wore his underwear. In the letter she told of her gratefulness to friends, relatives and strangers who offered support. After the funeral she used money sent to her to outfit Bianca's room and decorate it with Mickeys and Minnies and Donalds.    \"I've written everything I could for her,\" said Ms. Gonzalez, 23, who had worked as an executive secretary. \"Mostly about Alex, both the good and the bad.\"   With great joy she recalled her romance with a man who had been unlike any other she had known, a man younger than herself, a man with a prison record, a Bronx tough guy raised mostly on the streets.   They had met at Orchard Beach. \"I remember when I met him I thought men were slime. I had gone out with men with good careers, with prospects. But I wasn't interested in settling down. I didn't want children. I had a good job. I liked traveling. I guess I was a flirt. Then I met Alex and in one day it all changed.\"   Alex was starting to change as well. Under her influence, he enrolled in a course on computer programming. He found a job. He learned to drive and bought a car. \"When I would come to visit him in the Bronx after work, wearing my business suits, it made him so proud. He thought of himself as an uptown man and I was his downtown woman.\"   They went to Cancun together. They took the apartment near where she grew up in Woodhaven and they talked of one day having a house on Long Island. Ms. Gonzalez's parents, at first troubled by the young man, started to see in him some of what their daughter saw.     \"We decided to have a baby,\" she said. \"Bianca was no accident. We talked about it and Alex wanted me to have his child. He really wanted a girl. We stopped using protection and we decided on the name. Now he's gone but she is here and when I look at her I see him. Would my life be better if he had lived and I never had her? There were things about him that hurt me to know, including things I found out after he died, but I loved him and he loved me. I am religious. I went to Catholic schools and I really believe that what happened was meant to be.\"   \"If you measure life in years, you could think I was shortchanged. But if you look at it as experience or the intensity of experience, the year and a half Alex and I were together were complete. There was nothing missing. Everything we did was right and now there is Bianca.\" Lovingly, zestfully, and with more grace of spirit than you might expect to find in someone of her age, she placed the sleeping girl in her crib.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940226","headline":"Review/Music; Orchestra Shows Off Its Ellington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/26/arts/review-music-orchestra-shows-off-its-ellington.html","abstract":"  Jazz performances can start in all sorts of ways, and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra opened its show at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night burning.
