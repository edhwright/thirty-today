But it is also a venture onto uncharted ground, since no Senator in modern times has contested a Senate subpoena for his private papers.   By tonight's overwhelming vote, the full Senate has given its Select Committee on Ethics the right to what the panel has been seeking: thousands of pages of Mr. Packwood's personal diaries. The panel's aim is not only to clear up accusations of sexual harassment against the Oregon Republican, but also to investigate possible criminal activities, which it thus far refuses to specify.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931103","headline":"BEARD BAN RULED UNFAIR TO BLACKS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/us/beard-ban-ruled-unfair-to-blacks.html","abstract":"  In the latest upset to an employer's prohibition against beards, a Federal appeals court in St. Louis has ruled that Domino's Pizza must waive its ban for black employees who have a common and sometimes painful skin ailment.

Any and all covered medical expense, including drugs, hospitalization, consultations and surgery, are paid for out of this account. At the end of each year, any unused portion of the fixed payment that the primary care physician has received from the insurance company is split between the physician and the company.

Olivier Nadal, a co-owner of his family's import and export business, one of the largest in Haiti, said his volume had decreased so much that unless gasoline was available soon, he would have to close his doors, throwing more than 600 employes out of work. As a result of the embargo, foreign pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell him goods for fear that they may not be able to get paid. Furthermore, Mr. Nadal said, his agricultural products are rotting in the countryside because of a lack of gasoline to transport them to Port-au-Prince, the capital.

If the break-even point is that high, WPIX would most likely reject the proposal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931103","headline":"Jordan Visits Bulls Practice, Oprah and Larry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/sports/on-pro-basketball-jordan-visits-bulls-practice-oprah-and-larry.html","abstract":"  \"Don't make it out to be anything,\" Jerry Krause was saying yesterday on the telephone from the general manager's office at the Chicago Bulls' training center in Deerfield, Ill., a northwest Chicago suburb. \"Michael's not coming back.

The work, which shows two dancers taking a curtain call, doubled its low estimate of $3.5 million. The action for the painting wasn't in the salesroom, but on the telephones.

In 1930, he sold his wife's car and borrowed some money to buy, for $2,300, a one-third interest in the Smithweld Company. He later became president of the company, before merging it with another firm. He has been retired from the welding business since 1965, but hardly idle.

Bossi, in her Oct 23 letter, states that within PruCare's network of doctors and pharmacies, many are situated within local neighborhoods. What she leaves unstated is that there is a campaign by PruCare with respect to pharmacies to bypass the small individually owned pharmacy and make member prescriptions reimbursable only when filled at chain pharmacies.   This effectively puts individually owned pharmacies at peril and is similar to the campaign by health maintenance organizations to buy up practitioner groups, thus positioning themselves to own conglomerates favored by the Clinton health plan. In short, the individual practitioner and the individual pharmacy can go the way of the dinosaur.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931103","headline":"Mantra for the Mayor: Deficit, Deficit, Deficit, Deficit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/opinion/mantra-for-the-mayor-deficit-deficit-deficit-deficit.html","abstract":"  Congratulations, Mr. Mayor-elect!

In other words, you're already in deep fiscal trouble.   It is not unusual for the victor to be rewarded with immediate fiscal woes. In 1974, Abe Beame found that John Lindsay had left him a sizable deficit. In 1978, Ed Koch inherited a billion-dollar deficit and a four-year plan designed largely by others to eliminate it. In 1990, he left City Hall with a $300 million hole to fill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931103","headline":"Reno Dusts Cobwebs Out of Justice Dept.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/opinion/l-reno-dusts-cobwebs-out-of-justice-dept-300193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As one whose Congressional responsibilities require working daily with the Department of Justice, I must disagree with the views expressed in your Oct. 26 front-page report of doubts about Attorney General Janet Reno in that department.

They'll have no part it. They respect the Cowboys, but they are not in awe of them. The Giants even seem to be a little cocky, if you go by some of the comments they made today. And they drew a critical response from Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson as the two teams turned up the volume in anticipation of their meeting Sunday in Texas.   Giants players talked about last year's Thanksgiving Day game at Texas Stadium, a 30-3 blowout won by the Cowboys. Toward the end of the game, with the Cowboys in complete control, they were blitzing quarterback Dave Brown, then a rookie. The Giants interpreted that as an attempt to humiliate them.   Call it trying to find emotional incentives for Sunday's game, call it whatever you wish, but some of the Giants talked about that game as if it were one of the greatest insults of all time.   \"You don't forget things like that,\" said defensive end Keith Hamilton. \"Dallas is the type of team that if you go down, they are going for the jugular. That left a bad taste in my mouth. They had us down and just tried to kick us. You don't forget that. I know I didn't.\"   Linebacker Corey Miller said: \"Jimmy Johnson is a coach that when you're down, he'll keep kicking and stomping. We remember what happened last year.\"   Johnson, told later in the day of those remarks, was clearly irked. \"It's a simple deal,\" said Johnson. \"They were trying to score, we were trying to stop them. I did not see their quarterback take a knee. If the quarterback takes a knee, we stop blitzing. I didn't see anybody pull back on us in 1989.\"   Johnson was referring to the Cowboys' 1-15 season in 1989, when teams were pummeling the sorry Cowboys.   Miller was the most vocal of the Giants players. And he can probably talk all he wants since he is having an outstanding season. Miller can back the talk. And although he didn't say anything shocking, his comments are indicative of how many of the Giants feel. That is, people are already awarding the division crown to Dallas. Miller said he believes that the Cowboys are a great team and do have a shot at winning the rest of their games. But he also said they are \"definitely beatable\" and \"not as good as they were last year.\"   \"I think defensively they're not as strong,\" said Miller. \"I don't think their linebackers are playing as well as they did last year. I think with our linemen, they can power them. But they're a good football team.\"    Dallas has dropped off slightly from last season. It ranks seventh in the National Football League in total defense. The Cowboys spent much of last season as the league's No. 1 ranked defense. Cowboy Vows Defense Will Improve    \"I'm getting tired of hearing about our run defense,\" said Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson. \"We've struggled the last couple of weeks, but we can play better than that. We will prove it this week. You can quote that.\"   Miller said that one of the reasons for the defensive dropoff was the loss of defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt, now the head coach of the Chicago Bears.   \"To me, they're just not as good,\" Miller said. \"That's my opinion. They're a great football team. I'm not saying they're not. But it's not like they can't be beat.\" An Endorsement From Smith    They're not likely to be beat if running back Emmitt Smith has the kind of day he did against the Eagles -- 30 carries for 237 yards, the sixth-highest single-game total ever. The Giants know that Dallas has only two or three running plays -- the problem is, no one can stop them. That's because of Smith.    But he isn't taking the Giants' defense for granted.   \"I think they're playing with a lot more confidence this year,\" said Smith. \"I think they have a great defensive scheme over there. They're pursuing the ball, they're getting after the ballcarrier. They're forcing some bad plays, and they're making a bunch of great plays also.\"   The Giants have allowed just one rushing touchdown this season and only 87 rushing yards a game, second in the conference.   \"I just don't see him getting 200 yards against our defense,\" Miller said. EXTRA POINTS    LAWRENCE TAYLOR spent most of practice Wednesday riding a stationary bike as he tries to rest his hamstring injury. Coach DAN REEVES said he was doubtful for Sunday's game, but the Giants will know more tomorrow. Running back RODNEY HAMPTON practiced for the first time since injuring his left knee almost a month ago. He looked fine and Reeves said he expects him to start.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"Chinese Issuing What May Be Deng's Final Book","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/chinese-issuing-what-may-be-deng-s-final-book.html","abstract":"  China's top Communist Party officials appeared to be preparing for the death of their paramount leader this week by issuing what is likely to be the final volume of Deng Xiaoping's private speeches.

But the honors of the evening went to an artist of a rather different kind, Carmen de Lavallade, whose choreography and performing were a highlight of the enjoyably varied program.    Both Trisler, who died in 1979, and Ms. de Lavallade were trained in dance technique and the art of the theater by Lester Horton, a West Coast dance original.

Many more will be there to watch the Tigers' star running back, Keith Elias, than Penn's quarterback, Jimmy McGeehan.   The unheralded McGeehan doesn't mind. He is thrilled to be a part of the mild turbulence that has been mounting in his home city this week. \"It's great,\" he said. \"A little excitement will help. I was reading in the paper the other day where college football in Philadelphia is way down.\"   It is fitting that McGeehan will be playing such an important role in this game between two 7-0 teams whose likely prize is the Ivy League championship. He is all Philadelphia, from the East Falls section up near City Line, a graduate of Roman Catholic High School downtown and a Phillies fan.   His brother, John, also a quarterback, helped Penn win two Ivy championships, in 1983 and 1984, and is now a district attorney in Philadelphia. His father, John, works as a power director for Philadelphia Electric and his mother, Mary, is a legal secretary. A Key Role    McGeehan's role on Saturday is important because he must sustain the Penn offense to keep the Princeton offense off the field. Princeton's Elias has been running through defenses for three years and if the Quakers are to win this game they cannot allow the Tiger tailback to have the ball 30 times, or even 20 times.   McGeehan is ready for the task. A senior, he has had a superb season as a cool director of an offense that has averaged 33 points a game and made few mistakes. There have been only 12 turnovers and just 34 punts.   \"He may now be the best quarterback in the Ivy League,\" said Steve Tosches, the Princeton coach. That's a real tribute because the competition includes such good quarterbacks as Dartmouth's Jay Fiedler, Harvard's Mike Giardi, Cornell's Bill Lazor and Princeton's Joel Foote.   There is nothing fancy about McGeehan, a 6-foot, 190-pound drop-back passer good at reading defenses and getting the ball to the right receiver. He has two excellent targets in Chris Brassell and Miles Macik. Brassell averages 20 yards a catch and Macik has averaged seven receptions a game in a balanced offense that also features a 156-pound tailback, Terrance Stokes, who averages 111 yards rushing each game.   Stokes is an inside power runner. \"He's tough,\" says McGeehan, free with his compliments. \"Our offensive line has been great. I have hardly been touched in seven games.\"  An Upset of Dartmouth    The first game, an upset of defending Ivy League champion Dartmouth in which McGeehan outperformed Fiedler, gave a hint of what the Penn quarterback had become.   There had been more downs than ups in his first two seasons. He was benched late in his sophomore year as the coach, Gary Steele, went with a senior, Fitz McKinnon, in an effort to win some games and keep his job.   Last season, a new coach, Al Bagnoli, was skeptical and McGeehan did not start at first. The other day, Bagnoli said: \"A lot of his improvement came in the last couple of games last season. Our primary tailback was hurt and we had to go more with the pass. Jimmy stepped up. We've made some subtle changes in how we're throwing the ball and he's been comfortable and confident from the start.\"   McGeehan has twice played Princeton and is 0 for 2 in close games, losing, 20-14, last year and, 17-12, in 1991 when he had 47 pass attempts. \"Both times we just didn't get the job done,\" he said. \"Now here comes another chance.\"   EXTRA POINTS    In the Division I-AA weekly poll, conducted by The Sports Network, Princeton is ranked No. 16 and Penn No. 22. It is the first time in the history of the poll that two Ivy teams have been in the top 25 in the same week. . . . The last time Penn and Princeton met as unbeaten teams was 99 years ago. The Quakers had outscored nine opponents, 330-10, and Princeton its seven, 192-0. Penn won, 12-0. But Princeton leads this series, 59-24-1. . . . The last Princeton team to win its first seven games was the undefeated 1964 team.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"Pornography's Role : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/opinion/IHT-pornographys-role-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"The Professor Declares War on Free Speech\" (Opinion, Oct. 28): .George F.

Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. Howard Korder's play \"The Lights\" is set in an unnamed \"large city\" of \"the modern era\" that would have been right at home in Rudolph Giuliani's campaign commercials. Crime, drugs and garbage are rampant. The homeless are always underfoot. Civic corruption is ubiquitous. The good old immigrant values that once built the town are in rout.    And Mr. Korder's prescriptions for salvation are vague. \"The Lights\" is a two-hour, 40-minute wallow in the mess that would rather curse the familiar darkness with Expressionist flourishes than light any candles. It is the second urban nightmare play to arrive Off Broadway this week -- following \"The Treatment\" at the Public -- and it often seems indistinguishable from recent productions of Jose Rivera's \"Marisol\" and Sophie Treadwell's \"Machinal,\" not to mention the doomsday Gotham of Tim Burton's \"Batman\" films.

After her partner opened one heart, she charged ahead with Blackwood. A Tempting Save    The final contract of seven hearts would have been a lay-down, but East saved in seven spades. This action would be less tempting today, for since the beginning of this year the laws of social bridge conform to duplicate and nonvulnerable penalties for defeats of four tricks or more are heavier. In this case the save was due to cost 1300, since the defense scores a diamond ruff.

In addition to \"Dreams and Shadows\" at the National Academy of Design (review on page C31), there are several group shows, large and small, all of which offer seldom-encountered work.   Two of the exhibitions are at the Metropolitan itself. \"Master Drawings of the Hudson River School\" is a selection of some three dozen works on paper. In broad outlines, the history of American landscape painting is here in a nutshell, from its sleepy topographic beginnings to Thomas Cole's romantic \"Fountain\" (1843), as atmospheric as an opera set. In the tenderly rendered tree studies of Jervis McEntee one finds the blend of pragmatism and poetry that defined the American landscape at its best, a mixture also evident in the work of Frederic Edwin Church. His \"Tequendama Falls Near Bogota, Colombia\" has a gestural burst of white gouache for falling water, but beside it are color notions rendered in a precise, penciled script.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"DO'S AND DON'TS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/style/IHT-dos-and-donts.html","abstract":"One-Parent Family Trips","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Murder Indictment Given In Bucket-Tossing Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/nyregion/murder-indictment-given-in-bucket-tossing-case.html","abstract":"  Citing \"circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,\" a grand jury handed up an indictment of second-degree murder yesterday against the man who threw a bucket from a Washington Heights rooftop that killed a police officer in the street below.

There's a ring of Mother Superior authority that may stir some childhood memory of being caught with one's fingers where they shouldn't be. The words also have an almost thrilled conspiratorial tone, as if one had been apprehended by a fellow traveler who wants all the details.

At its core, the Clinton plan would create a web of regional \"health alliances\" to pool the purchasing power of consumers and negotiate on their behalf for lower prices for health insurance. The Clinton system would not necessarily produce new costs -- indeed it is intended to operate more efficiently than what Americans have now -- but it will almost certainly reshuffle the deck in who has to pay the costs of medical care. Sharing Cities' Burdens    The states, not Washington, are to create these new purchasing pools and decide their boundaries. What is critical, though, is that the regional alliances that include big cities with costly health care burdens will be forced to charge their residents more than those that do not.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Athlete Is Butcher's Ticket to Press Pass","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/nyregion/our-towns-athlete-is-butcher-s-ticket-to-press-pass.html","abstract":"  DUST off a seat in the press box, boys.

Like most fans, I wonder why you retired so impulsively, apparently without a goal in mind. It is undoubtedly true that you must have wanted to get away from the pressure and attention of being the N.B.A.'s premier performer. Was it also perhaps a case of emotional ambivalance of the sort that often accompanies fears of being unable to perform up to previous standards?\n\nYou understand your prowess as a player better than anyone else. But like a great warrior, you know that many young warriors aspire to dethrone you at the first sign of weakness. To a warrior, the result is death. In basketball, the punishment is perhaps more brutal: being in the middle of the pack (or, in your case, being just one of the top 10 players). Faced with the inevitable return of mortality, coupled with the emotional turmoil you have endured and the physical drain of a championship season and the Olympic Games, it is no wonder that you said \"no mas!\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Review/Film; Finishing Symphony Called Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/movies/review-film-finishing-symphony-called-life.html","abstract":"Composer with writer's block meets healer.

Some of the Mayor's friends and aides say that when he returns he will begin to confront important questions about his future, ranging from where he and Mrs. Dinkins will live to what the Mayor will do when he leaves office in January.   Mr. Dinkins, 66 years old, has not talked yet about his plans, several close friends and senior aides said yesterday. \"David Dinkins is not going to retire,\" said Basil A. Paterson, the former New York Secretary of State, who is one of the Mayor's oldest friends. \"He'll stay in the city and he'll stay active.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Strawberry to the Royals?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/sports/sports-people-baseball-strawberry-to-the-royals.html","abstract":"  DARRYL STRAWBERRY may get to move from Los Angeles after all.

Some $8 million remains over the last two years on Strawberry's contract, but that is said to be no problem for the Royals in the wake of GEORGE BRETT 's retirement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Diversity's Down Side; Image and Reality Clash in a New Jersey Town, and Hispanic Residents Feel the Impact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/nyregion/diversity-s-down-side-image-reality-clash-new-jersey-town-hispanic-residents.html","abstract":"  The men who used to gather in front of stores here to shoot the breeze are gone, brushed off the streets in recent weeks in police sweeps that made loitering seem like a major crime.

But Federal Emergency Management Agency failures, along with a program of heavily subsidized insurance that has delighted the real estate industry, is having exactly the opposite effect.\n\nIn creating the national flood insurance program, Congress hoped to promote state and local land-use controls that would minimize loss from floods and guide development away from flood-prone coastal, river and lake areas. In exchange for subsidized insurance, communities were to reduce the concentration of flood-prone structures. New construction would be a safe distance from erosion and flood zones so that disaster relief would become less and less necessary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Breaking Impasse on Crime Bill, Senate Supports $22 Billion Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/us/breaking-impasse-on-crime-bill-senate-supports-22-billion-plan.html","abstract":"  In a breakthrough on a big anticrime measure, the Senate tonight voted 94 to 4 to set up a $22 billion trust fund to provide localities with 100,000 new police officers over five years and money to build regional prisons to house the nation's most violent inmates.

A few senators concocted a civil liberties case against compelling Senator Packwood to produce diaries that he himself had invoked in his own defense against sexual misconduct charges. Only the final vote of 94 to 6 to enforce the Ethics Committee's subpoena redeemed the distasteful two-day debate.    The Ethics Committee should not reward Senator Packwood's intransigence; it ought to seek an early court hearing to enforce the subpoena.
