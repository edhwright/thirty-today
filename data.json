Disconnected from any particular reality, satire becomes merely a demonstration of eccentric behavior, which is a fairly accurate description of \"Barjo,\" the new French comedy opening today at the Film Forum.   The film's provenance is impressive. It was directed by Jerome Boivin and written by him with Jacques Audiard. They had collaborated on the ghoulishly funny \"Baxter,\" a first-person (first-dog?) account of the rise and fall of a dirty-white bull terrier in search of the perfect master. Like the exemplary \"Baxter,\" which was inspired by a novel by the American writer Ken Greenhall, the new film has as its source material an involving, seriously lunatic American novel, \"Confessions of a Crap Artist\" (1975) by Philip K.

Reuters reported that the couple were on their way to the Eden Roc Hotel in Cap d'Antibes when a car swerved in front of their vehicle, forcing it to stop. Four men with semiautomatic pistols surrounded the limousine, grabbed the chauffeur and took the keys to the trunk, where they found the jewelry and cash in a handbag, the report said. The incident occurred so quickly that bodyguards following in a car had no time to intervene, it added.    The police said the robbery had been meticulously planned. They said they later found the getaway car, containing some of the Davises' personal documents, and arrested two French passengers, said to be accomplices in the robbery. The police said the two would be taken before a judge today to be placed under investigation -- a prelude to criminal charges -- for receiving stolen property.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930707","headline":"An End to Nuclear Testing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/07/opinion/an-end-to-nuclear-testing.html","abstract":"  For nearly half a century, test explosions in the Nevada desert were a reverberating reminder of cold war insecurity.

Yet too often, the medicine cabinet holds four brands of toothpaste but nothing for a sting or scald. Only after an accident or onset of illness does a panicky hunt begin for items to clean, cure and comfort.   Medical experts say that while a wisely stocked, convenient and orderly first-aid kit may not fully treat a health crisis, its value is in helping to limit pain and complications until a doctor's examination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Health"},{"date":"19930708","headline":"U.S. Programs Will Pay Bulk Of Storm Costs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/08/us/us-programs-will-pay-bulk-of-storm-costs.html","abstract":"  The Government is expected to pay for most of the more than $800 million in insured losses from flooding in the Midwest, Federal officials and industry experts said yesterday.

Unlike most early bop drummers, who worked in small groups, he preferred playing with big bands and in 1980 formed Superband. He now splits his time between a descendant of that big band, Superband II (a 17-piece group that played on Wednesday at Yardbird Suite, the new club at 35 Cooper Square, in the East Village), and a five-piece group called Persipitation, which features Sue Terry, an imaginative young saxophonist who has been with Mr. Persip for several years. Persipitation, which includes Carlton Holms on piano, Leon Lee Dorsey on bass and Eli Fountain on percussion, is at Birdland tonight and tomorrow for shows each night at 9 and 10:30 P.M. and midnight. There is a $10 music charge at tables and a $10 minimum. At the bar, the music charge is $5 and the minimum is one drink.

Then he returned to his original trade, sign painting, for 24 years until he was lured back to music by an appearance in a film for which he played an enthusiastically received concert at the Public Theater in 1980. Since then he has been performing regularly with the bassist Gary Mazzaroppi. One of their earliest engagements was at Zinno, where they still play several weeks a year.

His father reminds him to practice his music; he makes a friend of a young man his age, and they both have crushes on a girl from a neighboring estate.
