How well did he do it? Was it worth doing? If Mr. Roche's design for the Jewish Museum's new expansion brings to mind Goethe's standard formula for critical appraisal, that may be because the design itself is somewhat formulaic. It is an appealing formula, and Mr. Roche carries it off with devotion and skill. The building does not lack conviction. But it does lack depth.   This Sunday's long-awaited reopening of the museum after two and a half years of renovations brings to fulfillment an ambitious plan, conceived in 1989, to give the Jewish Museum a home worthy of its mission. With a permanent collection of more than 27,000 objects -- ranging from archeological artifacts to contemporary paintings -- this is the major American museum devoted to Jewish culture and history. The museum has grown in stages since its founding in 1904, when it was provisionally housed in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary. Since 1947, it has occupied the former Warburg Mansion on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street. The choice of Mr. Roche, an internationally celebrated architect whose achievements include the master plan for additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, insured that the museum would assume an even grander presence on Museum Mile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Restaurant Critic Is Named","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/arts/restaurant-critic-is-named.html","abstract":"  The appointment of Ruth Reichl as restaurant critic of The New York Times was announced yesterday by Warren Hoge, assistant managing editor for cultural news and style coverage.

There's some unevenness among the three inaugural exhibitions: \"From the Inside Out: Eight Contemporary Artists,\" an overly tame group show of contemporary art; \"Collecting for the 21st Century: Recent Acquisitions and Promised Gifts,\" a wide-ranging display of recent acquisitions, and \"Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey,\" an epic presentation of objects from the museum's permanent collection, whose final sections will not be completely installed until later this summer.

M. Rosenthal (column, June 1): Americans of my generation, children of the Depression years, who grew up during World War II and were very active and centrist Democrats, voted for President Clinton because we believed he was an intelligent and practical professional politician who had learned from his McGovern activist days and his governorsip of Arkansas that we as a nation are people of the center. Many of us had voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush in 1988 because we did not agree with the ideology of the Democratic Party or feel represented by its shrill, often faddish culture. We voted for President Clinton.   I am at a loss to understand how this intelligent man could have misunderstood the \"centrist\" message he conveyed during the campaign and made a first priority of the sexual roles of military personnel; then the firing of the travel bureau of the White House in what appeared to be a failure of due process, and then getting a haircut in a plane on a runway while holding up traffic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Review/Theater; Reviving an Intimate Musical With Romantic Intentions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/theater/review-theater-reviving-an-intimate-musical-with-romantic-intentions.html","abstract":"  THE first time I ever walked out of a Broadway show was to see \"She Loves Me\" a second time. It was Christmas week of 1963, and \"She Loves Me,\" a sensitive flower among hard-edged comic blockbusters like \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" and \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,\" was surely a goner with the New Year. It was now or never. I bolted out of the 2 o'clock matinee of another flop (remember \"Jennie,\" anyone?) to take one last look at \"She Loves Me\" at 3.   Though I didn't know much about anything else in 1963, time has borne out my youthful infatuation with \"She Loves Me.\" The proof is at the Roundabout Theater Company, where this musical has finally received the exquisite revival of its fans' dreams and where surely new fans will soon be made by the legion. An intimate work with nothing on its sophisticated mind other than romance, \"She Loves Me\" is no less an anomaly on Broadway today than it was 30 years ago. Given how the world has aged since then, audiences may be hungrier than ever for this summons to a continuously melodic evening of sheer enchantment and complete escape.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"If Roles Were Reversed : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/opinion/IHT-if-roles-were-reversed-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding Japan's continuing trade surplus with the United States, I wonder what the American attitude would be if the United States had the trade surplus? .Would Americans be any more willing than the Japanese to reduce the trade gap?

Not only is one restaurant's tandoori chicken barely distinguishable from another's, but menus themselves also begin to appear interchangeable.   So it is a pleasure to find a restaurant like the six-week-old Al Hamra, which stands out not so much for the quality of its cooking -- although the food is fresh and lively -- as for the incredible value it offers.

And he certainly didn't think he would someday have this job: Coach of his hometown Montreal Canadiens, the most storied franchise in National Hockey League history, a team that he led to an unparalleled 24th Stanley Cup in his first year as head coach.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"NEW U.S. PROGRAM OF STUDENT LOANS CLEARS KEY PANEL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/us/new-us-program-of-student-loans-clears-key-panel.html","abstract":"  The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee today approved a modified version of President Clinton's proposal to put the Federal Government in the business of lending money directly to college students.

Tomorrow, seventh-seeded Wichita State (58-16) will be in its fourth championship game in six trips to the Division I baseball championships. The Shockers will play the winner of today's game between fifth-seeded Louisiana State (51-17-1) and fourth-seeded Long Beach State (46-18). The Shockers, who beat Oklahoma State 12-7 with a late rally in their regular-season meeting this year, took the lead early this time. Walks to Joey Adams, Richie Taylor and Darren Dreifort, his an intentional one with two out, set up Joey Jackson's two-run double in the third. Blake then drove in two with a single and Adam McCollough followed a single by Tommy Tilma with another single to drive in a fifth run off Cowboys starter Jake Benz (9-2). Joe Wallace doubled and Ernesto Rivera drove him home with a single in the bottom of the inning, but Wichita State matched that when Jackson walked with the bases loaded in the fourth. (AP) TENNIS  3 Big Names Move to Quarterfinals  Three former Wimbledon champions, Stefan Edberg of Sweden and Germans Boris Becker and Michael Stich, all advanced to the quarterfinals with victories yesterday at the Queen's Club grass-court championships in London.

Edberg defeated Reneberg for the sixth time in seven meetings but did not gain control until he came back from 40-0 to break serve and take a 3-1 lead in the final set. Becker defeated the 14th-seeded Frenchman, Guillaume Raoux, by 6-4, 6-4, in 80 minutes. Stich marched past 12th-seeded David Wheaton of the United States, 6-4, 6-3. In another match, Grant Stafford, Wednesday's upset winner over top-ranked Pete Sampras, ended his run with a 6-4, 6-3 loss to No. 16 Marc Goellner. (AP) Shriver Rallies to Win: The former champion Pam Shriver found some of her former magic yesterday, recovering from a breakdown in the final set to defeat Mana Endo of Japan, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, at the women's grass-court championships at Edgbaston, England. Shriver, seeded No. 7, won the event from 1984-87. She fell behind by 3-1 in the third but fought back to win on her first match point when Endo netted a backhand. \"I'm grateful I dug this match out,\" Shriver said. \"This is the kind of player on grass I would have chewed up and spat out a few years ago.\" Second-seeded South African Amanda Coetzer joined Martina Navratilova on the sidelines after losing by 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 to Chanda Rubin, seeded 15th.

Hialeah that a city's prohibition of ritual animal sacrifice violated the constitutional right to free exercise of religion. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which was joined in full by Justice John Paul Stevens and in most respects by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Byron R. White. Justice David H. Souter wrote a separate opinion, as did Justice Harry A. Blackmun, whose opinion was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. BY JUSTICE KENNEDY, For the Court    The principle that government may not enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice is so well understood that few violations are recorded in our opinions. Concerned that this fundamental nonpersecution principle of the First Amendment was implicated here, however, we granted certiorari.    Our review confirms that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand, failed to perceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the nation's essential commitment to religious freedom. The challenged laws had an impermissible object, and in all events the principle of general applicability was violated because the secular ends asserted in defense of the laws were pursued only with respect to conduct motivated by religious beliefs. We invalidate the challenged enactments and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.   This case involves practices of the Santeria religion, which originated in the 19th century. When hundreds of thousands of members of the Yoruba people were brought as slaves from eastern Africa to Cuba, their traditional African religion absorbed significant elements of Roman Catholicism. The resulting syncretion, or fusion, is Santeria, \"the way of the saints.\" The Cuban Yoruba express their devotion to spirits, called orishas, through the iconography of Catholic saints. Catholic symbols are often present at Santeria rites, and Santeria devotees attend the Catholic sacraments.    The Santeria faith teaches that every individual has a destiny from God, a destiny fulfilled with the aid and energy of the orishas. The basis of the Santeria religion is the nurture of a personal relation with the orishas, and one of the principal forms of devotion is an animal sacrifice. The sacrifice of animals as part of religious rituals has ancient roots.                    . . .         According to Santeria teaching, the orishas are powerful but not immortal. They depend for survival on the sacrifice. Sacrifices are performed at birth, marriage and death rites, for the cure of the sick, for the initiation of new members and priests, and during an annual celebration. Animals sacrificed in Santeria rituals include chickens, pigeons, doves, ducks, guinea pigs, goats, sheep and turtles. The animals are killed by the cutting of the carotid arteries in the neck. The sacrificed animal is cooked and eaten, except after healing and death rituals.                    . . .         The religion was brought to this nation most often by exiles from the Cuban revolution. The District Court estimated that there are at least 50,000 practitioners in South Florida today.    Petitioner Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye Inc. (Church), is a not-for-profit corporation organized under Florida law in 1973. The Church and its congregants practice the Santeria religion. . . . In April 1987, the Church leased land in the city of Hialeah, Fla., and announced plans to establish a house of worship as well as a school, cultural center, and museum. . . .   The prospect of a Santeria church in their midst was distressing to many members of the Hialeah community.                    . . .         In September 1987, the City Council adopted three substantive ordinances addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Ordinance 87-52 defined \"sacrifice\" as \"to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture or mutilate an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption,\" and prohibited owning or possessing an animal \"intending to use such animal for food purposes.\"                     . . .         The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" The city does not argue that Santeria is not a \"religion\" within the meaning of the First Amendment. Nor could it. Although the practice of animal sacrifice may seem abhorrent to some, \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.\" Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div. (1981). Given the historical association between animal sacrifice and religious worship, petitioners' assertion that animal sacrifice is an integral part of their religion \"cannot be deemed bizarre or incredible.\" Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security (1989). Neither the city nor the courts below, moreover, have questioned the sincerity of petitioners' professed desire to conduct animal sacrifices for religious reasons. We must consider petitioners' First Amendment claim.   In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990).                    . . .         Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible, if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation, the law is not neutral (see Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith) and it is invalid unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest. There are, of course, many ways of demonstrating that the object or purpose of a law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct. To determine the object of a law, we must begin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face. A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or context. Petitioners contend that three of the ordinances fail this test of facial neutrality because they use the words \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual,\" words with strong religious connotations. We agree that these words are consistent with the claim of facial discrimination, but the argument is not conclusive. The words \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\" have a religious origin, but current use admits also of secular meanings. The ordinances, furthermore, define \"sacrifice\" in secular terms, without referring to religious practices.                    . . .         The record in this case compels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of the Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances. . . . No one suggests, and on this record it cannot be maintained, that city officials had in mind a religion other than Santeria.   It becomes evident that these ordinances target Santeria sacrifice when the ordinances' operation is considered. Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object. To be sure, adverse impact will not always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting. For example, a social harm may have been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart from discrimination. The subject at hand does implicate, of course, multiple concerns unrelated to religious animosity, for example, the suffering or mistreatment visited upon the sacrificed animals and health hazards from improper disposal. But the ordinances when considered together disclose an object remote from these legitimate concerns. The design of these laws accomplishes instead a \"religious gerrymander,\" Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.                    . . .         In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santeria adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular killings, and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below committed clear error in failing to reach this conclusion.   We turn next to a second requirement of the Free Exercise Clause, the rule that laws burdening religious practice must be of general applicability. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 879-881. All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice. . . .   The principle that government, in pursuit of legitimate interests, cannot in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief is essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause. . . . In this case we need not define with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a prohibition is of general application, for these ordinances fall well below the minimum standard necessary to protect First Amendment rights.                    . . .         We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah's ordinances pursues the city's governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief. The ordinances \"ha(ve) every appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to impose upon  [ Santeria worshippers ]  but not upon itself.\" The Florida Star v. B. J. F. (1989). This precise evil is what the requirement of general applicability is designed to prevent.   A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny. To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must advance \"interests of the highest order\" and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests. . . . A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It follows from what we have already said that these ordinances cannot withstand this scrutiny.                    . . .        BY JUSTICE SOUTER, Concurring   This case turns on a principle about which there is no disagreement, that the Free Exercise Clause bars government action aimed at suppressing religious belief or practice. The Court holds that Hialeah's animal-sacrifice laws violate that principle, and I concur in that holding without reservation.   Because prohibiting religious exercise is the object of the laws at hand, this case does not present the more difficult issue addressed in our last free-exercise case, Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990), which announced the rule that a \"neutral, generally applicable\" law does not run afoul of the Free Exercise Clause even when it prohibits religious exercise in effect. The Court today refers to that rule in dicta, and despite my general agreement with the Court's opinion I do not join Part II, where the dicta appear, for I have doubts about whether the Smith rule merits adherence. I write separately to explain why the Smith rule is not germane to this case and to express my view that, in a case presenting the issue, the Court should re-examine the rule Smith declared.   According to Smith, if prohibiting the exercise of religion results from enforcing a \"neutral, generally applicable\" law, the Free Exercise Clause has not been offended. I call this the Smith rule to distinguish it from the noncontroversial principle, also expressed in Smith, though established long before, that the Free Exercise Clause is offended when prohibiting religious exercise results from a law that is not neutral or generally applicable. It is this noncontroversial principle, that the Free Exercise Clause requires neutrality and general applicability, that is at issue here. But before turning to the relationship of Smith to this case, it will help to get the terms in order, for the significance of the Smith rule is not only in its statement that the Free Exercise Clause requires no more than \"neutrality\" and \"general applicability,\" but in its adoption of a particular, narrow conception of free-exercise neutrality.                    . . .         While general applicability is, for the most part, self-explanatory, free-exercise neutrality is not self-revealing. A law that is religion neutral on its face or in its purpose may lack neutrality in its effect by forbidding something that religion requires . . . . A secular law, applicable to all, that prohibits consumption of alcohol, for example, will affect members of religions that require the use of wine differently from members of other religions and nonbelievers, disproportionately burdening the practice of, say, Catholicism or Judaism. Without an exemption for sacramental wine, Prohibition may fail the test of religion neutrality.   It does not necessarily follow from that observation, of course, that the First Amendment requires an exemption from Prohibition; that depends on the meaning of neutrality as the Free Exercise Clause embraces it. The point here is the unremarkable one that our common notion of neutrality is broad enough to cover not merely what might be called formal neutrality, which as a free-exercise requirement would only bar laws with an object to discriminate against religion, but also what might be called substantive neutrality, which, in addition to demanding a secular object, would generally require government to accommodate religious differences by exempting religious practices from formally neutral laws. If the Free Exercise Clause secures only protection against deliberate discrimination, a formal requirement will exhaust the Clause's neutrality command; if the Free Exercise Clause, rather, safeguards a right to engage in religious activity free from unnecessary governmental interference, the Clause requires substantive, as well as formal, neutrality.   Though Smith used the term \"neutrality\" without a modifier, the rule it announced plainly assumes that free-exercise neutrality is of the formal sort. Distinguishing between laws whose \"object\" is to prohibit religious exercise and those that prohibit religious exercise as an \"incidental effect,\" Smith placed only the former within the reaches of the Free Exercise Clause; the latter, laws that satisfy formal neutrality, Smith would subject to no free-exercise scrutiny at all, even when they prohibit religious exercise in application. The four Justices who rejected the Smith rule, by contrast, read the Free Exercise Clause as embracing what I have termed substantive neutrality. The enforcement of a law \"neutral on its face,\" they said, may \"nonetheless offend  [ the Clause's ]  requirement for government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.\" Id., at 896 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.) The rule these Justices saw as flowing from free-exercise neutrality, in contrast to the Smith rule, \"requir(es) the government to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" Id., at 894 . . . .   The proposition for which the Smith rule stands, then, is that formal neutrality, along with general applicability, are sufficient conditions for constitutionality under the Free Exercise Clause. That proposition is not at issue in this case, however, for Hialeah's animal-sacrifice ordinances are not neutral under any definition, any more than they are generally applicable. This case, rather, involves the noncontroversial principle repeated in Smith, that formal neutrality and general applicability are necessary conditions for free-exercise constitutionality. . . .   In being so readily susceptible to resolution by applying the Free Exercise Clause's \"fundamental nonpersecution principle,\" this is far from a representative free-exercise case. While, as the Court observes, the Hialeah City Council has provided a rare example of a law actually aimed at suppressing religious exercise, Smith was typical of our free-exercise cases, involving as it did a formally neutral, generally applicable law. The rule Smith announced, however, was decidedly untypical of the cases involving the same type of law. Because Smith left those prior cases standing, we are left with a free-exercise jurisprudence in tension with itself, a tension that should be addressed, and that may legitimately be addressed, by re-examining the Smith rule in the next case that would turn upon its application.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930612","headline":"1918: Warning to Labor : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/12/opinion/IHT-1918-warning-to-labor-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON - President Wilson has sent to the American Federation of Labor and to the American Alliance of Labor a telegram: \"The war may be lost in America as well as on the battlefields of France, and unreflecting suspensions of work may render vic","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930612","headline":"Moscow Won't Send More Troops to Balkans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/12/world/moscow-won-t-send-more-troops-to-balkans.html","abstract":"  Despite requests from Britain and France, Russia declined today to commit troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force that is to defend six \"safe havens\" for the beleaguered Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

By whatever name, it has to do with getting to an opponent's mind, upsetting his concentration, disrupting his psychological equilibrium.   Some sports purists condemn it as unsportsmanlike. They claim a game should be won solely on physical merits, sheer talent, and perhaps a lucky bounce. But games are played in the mind every bit as much as with the body. The proliferation of sports psychologists on today's scene proves that. It follows then that if the mind is in the action, it's as open to intimidation or coercion as the second baseman is to the runner trying to break up the double play with a spikes-high slide. A Needle Nonetheless    In baseball, basketball, football and hockey, the jockeying of an opponent is usually verbal, very direct, often crude; and, as when Jackie Robinson broke into the major leagues, viciously mean and racist. In golf, jockeying is more subtle, in keeping with the sport's courteous ambiance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/travel/c-correction-610293.html","abstract":"  An essay on May 30 about rediscovering a Jewish heritage while traveling omitted part of a sentence.

The roster of artists ranges from Odetta, Tommy Makem, Pete Seeger and Livingston Taylor to dozens of other solo and group performers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Albania Fears 'Ethnic Cleansing' May Spread to Kosovo Next","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/world/albania-fears-ethnic-cleansing-may-spread-to-kosovo-next.html","abstract":"  On the other side of the border checkpoint in the wooded mountains a half hour's drive from this ragged town, a village of neat white houses is all that is visible of Kosovo, a Serbian province largely populated by ethnic Albanians.

That was in 1960. Now he's back in a touring production of the show about the Knights of the Round Table and their ladies fair. Only this time he's appearing as King Arthur. Among other things, that means he'll be singing \"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight\" instead of \"If Ever I Would Leave You.\" Steve Blanchard and Patricia Kies are featured as Lancelot and Guenevere.

The director is John Tillinger, who has staged such successful McNally dramas as \"Lips Together, Teeth Apart\" and \"The Lisbon Traviata.\" Currently in previews; opens June 27.

Philip Glass is composing new music for the play, and George Tsypin is designing the scenery. Previews begin July 8; opens Aug. 1. Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center.

You've got to hand it to the director and lyricist Martin Charnin, the composer Charles Strouse and the book writer Thomas Meehan: they don't give up. Harve Presnell is playing Daddy and Donna McKechnie will be his secretary, Grace.

The latter piece, the curtain-raiser, involves a young man and a fraudulent fortuneteller. The former is about a sculptor, hoping to exhibit his wares to a wealthy buyer, until the lights in his apartment go out. Mr. Shaffer's trick is to reverse light and dark. When the electricity is on, the stage is dark. When it goes off, the stage lights come up, allowing the audience to observe a variety of characters stumbling over one another and the furniture. Gerald Gutierrez directs. Previews begin Aug. 10; opens Aug. 26; closes Oct. 10. Roundabout Theater Company at the Criterion Center, 1530 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan.

The book, just published, is hardly a rabble-rousing tract.

In America, at least, photojournalists with long lists of awards to their names have trouble finding assignments, especially assignments that deal with difficult and depressing subjects. It may be that television news is so full of harrowing events that magazines are putting their money on reassurance. People can get bad news and appeals for pity for free; why would they pay extra at the newsstands? At all events, in a field where some sort of mass venue is essential, many \"concerned photographers\" find themselves playing to small audiences, devising projects primarily for books, or shifting into the business of celebrity portraiture.   Sebastiao Salgado is an exception. Not only has he been showered with awards, he has also been lionized by museums and widely published in the last few years. In 1991, his work seemed to be everywhere. This is a testament in part to his talent, which is undeniable and impressive, in part to the importance of his subjects and his evident sympathy for them, and in part to a comfortingly old-fashioned esthetic and belief in the goodness of humanity and its capacity to survive. Even his photographs of famine in the Sahel, the drought-plagued region south of the Sahara, generally played up the dignity, the classical grace and resignation of the starving rather than the horrors of their plight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Lisa Johannessen and Robert Hoak Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/style/weddings-lisa-johannessen-and-robert-hoak-jr.html","abstract":"  Elizabeth Ann Johannessen, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John E.

For a while, during the mid-1960's, it outshone the Modern and the Whitney and the Guggenheim as the New York institution most committed to the cutting edge in art, organizing exhibitions of up-and-comers like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns and Kenneth Noland, and the show credited with launching Minimalism, \"Primary Structures.\"   Then its trustees decided to turn away from a program that had little or nothing to do with Jews and Judaism. When the director of the museum, Sam Hunter, resigned in 1967, he cited as the cause of his discontent the \"increasing emphasis on Judaica at the expense of contemporary art.\" Thereafter the museum, while becoming more central to the Jewish community, often seemed like a backwater in the bustling New York art scene; for many in the art world, it virtually ceased to exist.

The film's central notion -- that arrogant, unscrupulous or unthinking scientists might bring long-extinct dinosaurs back to life -- has clearly struck a chord.   The faint of heart may rest assured that even the maddest of scientists will not have the capability any time soon of resurrecting the dinosaurs. The movie, like Michael Crichton's book on which it was based, hypothesizes that blood-sucking mosquitoes dined on the dinos, and immediately afterward got stuck in tree resin that later hardened to amber, preserving the mosquitoes and the dinosaur blood for tens of millions of years. Modern scientists are then able, in the movie, to extract the blood from the amber, isolate a fragment of dinosaur DNA, stick it into an egg, and presto -- out comes a new dinosaur.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"A Fitting Tribute to Nation's History","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/theater-review-a-fitting-tribute-to-nation-s-history.html","abstract":"  IF historical accounts are to be trusted, the process of any revolution is as much about bureaucratic wrangling as is it about fire-and-brimstone rebellion.

With little formal training and a resolute refusal to play by the rules the second-generation New York School artist innovated a bold development in postwar art. Thirty-six years ago Mr. Chamberlain ripped two fenders off a 1929 Ford at the home of Larry Rivers in Southampton and welded them into an abstract sculpture called \"Shortstop.\" In so doing, he invented a method and medium for which he is well known.    His work is in the collections of institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Exhibitions attract fans from the Parrish to Paris. Mr. Chamberlain is in a position to savor success, but he continues to sniff out new challenges.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"New Strength for U.N.

In the most northwesterly corner of Italy, the Valgrisenche lies almost flush with the French border, a remnant of the ancient state of Savoy, an area culturally and linguistically French but held by Italy at various times from the 16th century onward. French Savoy was ceded to France by the Italian region of Piedmont in 1860. Tucked away between the celebrated Olympic ski resorts of the French Savoie such as Val d'Isere and Tignes to the west and Italy's popular Gran Paradiso national park to the east, it is often overlooked, attracting the few hikers and cross-country skiers in the winter who know its quiet old villages, profusion of Alpine wildflowers, pure air and good trails.   My husband and I drove up the Valgrisenche last July, on our way to the Gran Paradiso; the park border runs along the mountains separating the valley from the Val di Rhemes to the east. We had come to hike and decided to spend a few nights in each of the valley's three hamlets.   Our first stop was Planaval, whose old stone farmhouses, with slate roofs and wooden balconies, are tightly clustered below a waterfall-streaked cliff. Planaval is set among its fields, like a medieval village in its perfect simplicity: it consists only of a church, a few houses and one small hotel a moment's walk from the village.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Variety Marks Summer Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/theater-variety-marks-summer-season.html","abstract":"  FRIDAY'S convergence of openings marked the end of the winter season (\"Phantom\" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn) and the start of summer (the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's \"Taming of the Shrew\").

Although scores of early American potteries produced functional items from their local clay, most were displaced during the 20th century by inexpensive manufactured goods. The Seagrove potteries were an exception. Spurred by a lively wholesale trade, they hung on through the 1920's and 30's before demand declined and they dwindled to only five in the 1960's.   A revival began in the 1970's, however, fueled by a renewed market for handcrafted items. Today, some of Seagrove's potteries are owned by eighth and ninth generation artisans, others have been started by newcomers from out of state. Many operate out of weathered log cabins scattered only minutes from town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/connecticut-guide-235793.html","abstract":"  HUNTERS AND JUMPERS   The 64th annual Ox Ridge Horse Show will take place this week in Darien, running from Monday through Sunday at the Ox Ridge Hunt Club, 512 Middlesex Road.

Opens July 23.   \"RISING SUN.\" Sean Connery is the only Los Angeles detective who understands the Japanese character, and Wesley Snipes is the partner he leads through a murder investigation involving a powerful Japanese corporation. If you've read the Michael Crichton novel (the one he hates to hear called a Japan-bashing book), be prepared for a change: same murder, different murderer. Directed by Philip Kaufman (\"The Right Stuff\"). Opens July 30.   \"ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS.\" Mel Brooks spoofs the Robin Hood legend and tries to do for swashbucklers what he did for westerns in \"Blazing Saddles\" and monster movies in \"Young Frankenstein.\" Opens July 30.   August    \"THE FUGITIVE.\" In this remake of the television series, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, falsely accused of murdering his wife, on the lam and searching for the one-armed man. Opens Aug. 6.   \"HEART AND SOULS.\" This is described as a fantasy-comedy, and considering the plot, thank goodness. After Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodard, Kyra Sedgwick and David Paymer are killed in a bus accident, their spirits attach themselves to a newborn baby, who growns up to be Robert Downey Jr. Directed by Ron Underwood (\"City Slickers\"). Opens Aug. 6.   \"THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE.\" The first film directed by Mel Gibson. He stars as an outcast man with a badly scarred face (that's one way to change an image), who befriends an unhappy 12-year-old boy. Opens Aug. 20.   \"MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY.\" This is the film Woody Allen was directing last summer when the story of his messy personal life exploded in the tabloids. Diane Keaton replaced Mia Farrow and Anjelica Huston replaced a much younger actress as Mr. Allen's on-screen love interest. The title explains the plot, but the real mystery is how moviegoers will react to the post-scandal Woody. Opens Aug. 20.

An essay by Peter Haiko, an architectural historian who teaches at the University of Vienna, provides a competent and accessible introduction to the historical events and theoretical issues for those unfamiliar with the architecture of the period. The heart of the book, however, is the fine color and black-and-white photographs of more than 30 structures documenting the metamorphosis of Vienna from a Baroque capital draped in the mantle of historicist styles to the stern, uncompromising forms of the modern city. In addition to civic and religious structures, the building types surveyed include private villas, apartment buildings and municipal structures like gasworks, water towers and bridges. Like the finest examples of human portraiture, Roberto Schezen's photographs reveal character as well as physiognomy. While his treatment of facades and major interior spaces conveys the public decorum and grand scale of urban architecture, his photographs of building details and eccentric spaces reveal intriguing facets of his subjects. Mr. Schezen possesses a wonderful eye for decorative details. The result is an unusually subtle and nuanced description of architecture. This photographic paean to Vienna vividly testifies to architecture's ability to transcend the requirements of mere shelter and evoke the spirit of an age and the character of a place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"In the Region: New Jersey; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/realestate/in-the-region-new-jersey-recent-sales-776793.html","abstract":"  Alpha  $126,800   745 Pursel Street  3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath, 56-year-old ranch; covered back porch, move-in condition, full basement; taxes $2,664.

Yet it's possible to do so, and not just because he and Martha Graham created \"Episodes\" in 1959. That project was a pairing, rather than a collaboration: two independently choreographed works to music by Webern that were performed on the same program.    Balanchine, the familiar argument runs, was a product of ballet's most classical traditions. But this stance overlooks the questing spirit that led him to what was known from the 1920's onward as Absolute Dance. Among the milestones along Balanchine's journey toward that form are \"Apollo\" (1928), \"Concerto Barocco\" (1941), \"Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2\" (1941) and \"The Four Temperaments\" (1946). All four have been splendidly danced by the New York City Ballet during its current \"Balanchine Celebration.\" To see these works at the New York State Theater and to compare them with the way they were said to look when new is to gain insights into how Balanchine developed his own Absolute Dance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"'Humane' Isn't The Right Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/sports/l-humane-isn-t-the-right-word-541793.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   George Vecsey hints that the thoroughbred racing business \"carries the fin de siecle gloom of being yesterday's sport\" (The Times, June 6).

Bernstein's 75th birthday, on Aug. 25, will be celebrated worldwide, beginning on Monday with the New York Philharmonic's weeklong tribute to its former music director. Sony Classical is scheduled to complete its massive 119-CD \"Royal Collection\" of Bernstein recordings by the end of the year, and Deutsche Grammophon's release of his final recordings is now complete. With all the Bernstein videos flooding the market, it is only a matter of time before someone in Nashville, where Bernstein's archives now reside, \"sights\" him leaping passionately into the air at the climax of Mahler's \"Resurrection\" Symphony.   Passion is what Bernstein's music-making was all about. In his concerts, recordings, teaching, writing, speaking, one always sensed a life-or-death need to communicate the composer's message. Always controversial, he was damned in many quarters for exhibitionism on the podium, for exaggerating the music's emotional content at the expense of its structural integrity, for vulgarizing a dignified art form. In his early days and well into his Philharmonic tenure, critics labeled his interpretations brash and immature. Yet his audiences grew inexorably. Today, listeners to his recordings from that era join Stravinsky in saying \"Wow!\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"'Menace II Society' Stakes a Claim to Bleak Turf","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/movies/film-view-menace-ii-society-stakes-a-claim-to-bleak-turf.html","abstract":"  When two black teenagers, Caine and O-Dog, walk into a Korean grocery at the start of \"Menace II Society,\" the store owner and his wife see a dangerous pair. Quite possibly, the audience does, too. O-Dog's pants are slung fashionably low, showing several inches of his boxer shorts; the boys shuffle in as if they own the place, and O-Dog opens his quart bottle of beer while walking toward the cash register. They look and act like what they are -- members of the hip-hop generation, where attitude is everything -- but the Koreans obviously think they are about to be robbed.    It takes no time for the difference between Caine and O-Dog to become clear, though, and for viewers to realize that the violent, provocative \"Menace II Society\" is about seeing beyond stereotypes. O-Dog (Larenz Tate) shoots the grocer because the man has said, \"I feel sorry for your mother.\" Then he kills the wife. Caine (Tyrin Turner) doesn't kill anyone until days later, and then only as revenge for his cousin's murder. Though Caine grew up in Watts, the son of a drug-addicted mother and a drug-dealing father, he had never killed before. \"I never had a reason,\" he says.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Long Island Q&A;: David Bouchier;\nA Sociologist's Quizzical View of L.I.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/long-island-qa-david-bouchier-a-sociologists-quizzical-view-of-li.html","abstract":"FANS of public radio are getting a twice-weekly dose of the offbeat commentaries of a journalist and sociologist from Long Island, David Bouchier.
