Barkley led the Suns with 24 points and was able to sit out most of the second half after the game turned into a rout. (AP)   FIGURE SKATING  Harding Takes Lead  Tonya Harding of Portland, Ore., the 22-year-old former United States champion, skated the best technical program of her life last night to take the lead after the preliminariy program at Skate America in Dallas over the reigning world champion, Oksana Bayul of Ukraine. Harding skated deliberately but cleanly last night, landing a triple Lutz, double-toe combination, a double loop and a double axel. The four-minute long program will count for 66 percent of the total score. GOLF  Top Players Fall  Seeded players and par took a beating yesterday in the quarterfinals of the world match play championships in Virginia Water, England. Corey Pavin scored a 2 and 1 victory over Nick Price of Zimbabwe. Colin Montgomerie had two eagles on the way to a 6 and 4 upset of Bernhard Langer, and David Frost made a late charge to defeat Ian Woosnam 2 and 1.

This by no means ends American involvement in a United Nations operation, since 6,300 U.S. troops remain in Somalia, and 3,600 U.S. marines are deployed offshore. But Mr. Clinton seems finally to realize that commando raids and the civilian deaths that result from them can't cure what is ailing Somalia.    Taken together, the changed approach suggests that Mr. Clinton has heeded an aroused Congress and widespread bafflement over a humanitarian mission that by degrees turned into a bloody vendetta. Washington's new course does not mean Americans reject U.N. peacekeeping, but rather its muddled misapplication.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"Senate Ethics Panel Seeking To View Packwood Diaries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/us/senate-ethics-panel-seeking-to-view-packwood-diaries.html","abstract":"  The Senate ethics committee's inquiry into accusations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon boiled over today into a public feud over whether the panel has an unfettered right to read the Senator's voluminous private diaries.

Where other repertory groups might change the emphasis in an interpretation, or open up solo space beyond the constraints of the original three-minute recording of a piece, the Carnegie Hall band radically rewrote the material.   The historical and creative liberty the band took comes not a moment too soon. It happened during the second half of the show, when the band began to play some Goodman tunes newly arranged by its pianist, Jim McNeely. It started with \"Air Mail Special,\" then moved into \"Stompin' at the Savoy\" and \"King Porter Stomp.\" Each of these pieces featured odd touches, and some nice, sly dissonances that seemed to cram too many notes into too small a space; \"King Porter Stomp\" had two clarinets harmonizing on the melody.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"Administration Is Fighting Itself On Haiti Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/world/administration-is-fighting-itself-on-haiti-policy.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration appears to be at war with itself over policy toward Haiti and the Haitian leader supported by the White House, the Rev.

The voices could be hushed and ethereal with little vibrato, as in medieval music, or clear and hearty. Then, suddenly, a downward slide or a yelp or a yodel would make clear that the choir had its own sonic traditions.

The IRA aimed to assassinate the leadership of the loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA), supposedly attending a meeting above Frizzell's fish shop on the Shankill Road, Belfast. Two IRA members disguised as deliverymen entered the shop carrying a bomb, which detonated prematurely. Ten people were killed: one of the IRA bombers, a UDA member and eight Protestant civilians, two of whom were children. More than fifty people were wounded.

And they are crisscross-laced with about a dozen flat-wound, cotton athletic shoestrings, in sky blue, purple, argyle or gold, tied in large, loose, loopy bows. WHERE THEY'RE FOUND: On the 53-year-old feet of George Clinton, the zany godfather of funk music. The foot-stomping, blues-based, rock-and-R-and-B-fused sound has made him the funkiest man on the planet (and sometimes off). And so go his shoes.   The shoes are also featured in the album art of Mr. Clinton's latest recording, \"Hey Man . . . Smell My Finger,\" on Prince's Paisley Park Records. (And Prince is someone else with a fetish for uplifting footwear.) WHAT THEY REALLY, REALLY ARE: Attitude with sole. Like Elvis's (late Vegas period) oversize belt buckle, Louis Armstrong's handkerchief, James Brown's conked kinks and the omnipresent scarf that Aerosmith's Steven Tyler clings to when he sings, Mr. Clinton's shoes, no matter which ones he wears, are a show-biz-hyped distillation and projection of his style. And what a style: from a pair of five-inch-high platform sneakers to feathered, mid-calf-length, hand-stitched trapper boots.   Mr. Clinton, a former hairdresser in Newark who likes to wear his hair these days in a freaked-out, funny fright wig of braids, tresses and coiled multicolored yarn, was recently quoted in Interview magazine as saying, \"I can wear any style -- or have no style -- and it doesn't bother me.\" WHY: Funk feeds the deep nostalgia of inner-city baby boomers and the insatiable hunger of members of the hip-hop generation, who've sampled songs like Mr. Clinton's \"Atomic Dog,\" \"Flash Light\" and \"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)\" with abandon and reverence. And thus Mr. Clinton is high-stepping the pace of his almost-30-year recording career.   A resurgence of 1970's-era disco and funk music is also sweeping the nation, stirring a storm of interest and dollars in Mr. Clinton's various musical incarnations, including his solo act and his role as leader of the eccentric Parliament-Funkadelic funk mob. Re-releases of early albums are planned, as well as a major Clinton tour, record executives said. ADDITIONAL CLINTON PROPS: Funky eye wear, diapers, United States Army-surplus fatigues, chains, rings, wacky T-shirts, knit caps, broad-brimmed hats, capes, cloaks, face paint and, of course, his concert flying saucer, the Mothership. SHOE-IN: Mr. Clinton's ability to transform the ordinary -- like the pair of boxing shoes -- into a highly personalized statement \"speaks to his strength as an artist,\" said Susan Nininger, the Los Angeles-based costume designer who was the stylist on Mr. Clinton's \"Smell My Finger\" album shot and provided the shoes.   \"I was basically asked to bring the wildest stuff I could find and he would be able to wear it,\" she continued. \"I let my imagination go and meld with his outrageousness, and it worked.\" CLINTON'S STYLE CREDO: \"Colors don't clash; people do,\" from Mr. Clinton's new single, \"Paint the White House Black.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Barbara Nonas, Robert Hunter Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/style/weddings-barbara-nonas-robert-hunter-jr.html","abstract":"  Barbara Nonas, a daughter of Dr. Gerson Nonas of New York and the late Marjorie Crystal Nonas, was married yesterday to Robert Wallace Hunter Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs. Hunter of Sarasota, Fla.

The contrasting textures, shadings and points of view of the 213 crisp black-and-white photographs arouse much esthetic pleasure. But beyond his delight in form, the photographer seems to have stared at surfaces to capture substances and scrutinized the esthetics of characters for clues about their identities and contexts. Toward the end of the book, Mr. Friedlander, whose previous photography books include \"The Jazz People of New Orleans\" and \"Like a One-Eyed Cat,\" shows complete words and sentences: some graphically advertise the stuff of everyday life (chicken, a shoeshine parlor, books); most express beliefs and yearnings. From a white wall, an elongated black \"Sin\" heckles passers-by; a black-marker diatribe against Ronald Reagan defiles a model's smiling face; messages about love and sex are shouted in spray paint or whispered in tiny scratches. The photographer's homage to human ingenuity of expression is clear. Mr. Friedlander also emphasizes the power and mystery of his symbols. A dark spray-painted \"No,\" surmounted by a question mark and underlined three times, seems to be crying out in anguish -- but about what? To whom?

Its sinuous ornamentation was marked by strong, irregular accents; the chant was clearly influenced by African and Middle Eastern music.   One preoccupation of Mr. Reich and his wife, Beryl Korot, who created the video portions of \"The Cave,\" is the transformations and interpretations of sacred texts, including such traditional musical settings as Mr. Isaac's.

Flavia carefully reconstructs the dead expert's scholarship, in which she discerns tantalizing clues about an obscure Renaissance art scandal and dark hints of corruption within the Titian committee, whose surviving members are now being killed at an alarming rate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Buffalo Gals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/books/buffalo-gals.html","abstract":"BOOTS OF LEATHER, SLIPPERS OF GOLD\nThe History of a Lesbian Community.\nBy Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy\nand Madeline D.

When they leave the room, perhaps late in the night or early the next morning, they will have brought joy to the two cities they selected for expansion franchises and sadness and frustration to the three losers.   Of the five bidding cities, the favorites are St. Louis, Baltimore and Charlotte. The outsiders are Jacksonville and Memphis. The situation is further complicated because if St. Louis does not receive an expansion franchise, the New England Patriots may move there. Even insiders are unsure how the voting will go.   The two new teams will start playing in 1995. They will pay a franchise fee of $140 million each, as opposed to the $16 million paid by Seattle and Tampa Bay when the league last expanded, 1974 for the 1976 season. Millions and Millions More    The $140 million franchise cost is only the beginning. Each new team will need at least $70 million in operating funds. By last week, each bidding group (there are two from Baltimore) was required to filea $20 million letter of credit with the league. All complied except for St. Louis, whose letter is expected by Tuesday morning. For the winning groups, the $20 million will represent an installment on the first payment to the league of $42 million, due on Nov. 1.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Leather Everywhere","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/style/evening-hours-leather-everywhere.html","abstract":"  Harley-Davidson Cafe makes its debut, Oct. 19.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/nyregion/c-corrections-401093.html","abstract":"  An article on Oct. 10 about the book \"Homeboys: Portraits of Young Men Growing Up in New Haven\" credited Dru Nadler, the book's photographer, incompletely.

In the amphitheater of the public park, though, a small crowd of hippie-generation couples, plus assorted aunts and uncles and cousins, has gathered for what is surely an unusual event by Tyler standards: a free outdoor concert by the Texas singer and songwriter Jimmie Dale Gilmore.

This story of photography's incorporation and metamorphosis into art amplifies a recurrent theme of this century: a marginal form -- welded metal, factory-made artifacts, rhythm and blues -- shifts into prominence, even predominance.   \"Photographic: Works of the 60's and 70's,\" at the Zabriskie Gallery through Saturday, assembles examples of the many ways photography has progressed through the halls of art and into its living quarters. A couple of museum shows have presented the subject more comprehensively -- \"Photographic\" has only about three dozen objects -- and some have been more generous to photographers than this show, which deals mainly with artists who experimented with cameras. But several of the pieces here are quite satisfying and instructive, and the show touches enough bases to suggest that when photography took up residence in art's inner sanctum, the look of things shifted in just about every direction at once.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Norah K.

In March, the Royal Court Theater, a playhouse best known for promoting new British writing, opened its own \"American season\" with Anna Deavere Smith's \"Fires in the Mirror.\" Under the joint auspices of two longtime admirers of American drama -- Max Stafford-Clark, then the theater's artistic director, and Stephen Daldry, who holds the post now -- Howard Korder's \"Search and Destroy\" and David Mamet's \"Oleanna\" followed. So did an \"American\" play with a difference: it was written by an Englishman.   Martin Crimp, the 37-year-old author, wrote \"The Treatment\" in the summer of 1992, finishing it aptly enough on July 4. His inspiration came from his first-ever trip to the United States in 1991. On a playwrights' exchange between the Royal Court and New Dramatists in New York, he was clearly intrigued by what he found in the New World.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Neighborhood Report: Harlem; Bus Drivers Pay Tribute to the Memory of Mother Hale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-bus-drivers-pay-tribute-to-the-memory-of-mother-hale.html","abstract":"  Drivers from the 146th Street bus depot are taking the memory of Mother Hale on the road.

The opera can become a contest of simply making oneself heard. In a cast change on Wednesday night, Janis Martin was the clear winner over her male rivals, plowing across the lead role in high diva style. (Her tone suffered as a result: notes in the upper range had a rough finish and sometimes broke apart altogether.)   Yuri Mazurok was weaker by comparison. He made the motions of a successful Scarpia, but his burnished baritone got lost in the tumult of the first-act finale. Emil Ivanov, singing Cavaradossi, made more headway; his tenor, while not enormous, came through in rich, dark, Russian fashion.

But classical-music elitism was not yet the whipping boy it has lately become, and it was possible in those days to redefine a supposedly elitist repertory as revolutionary and egalitarian, by virtue of its one-player-to-a-part structure. The folksy charm of the society's founding director, Charles Wadsworth, gave this new populist image a push. By the late 1970's, Mr. Wadsworth and his group were widely credited with starting a chamber music boom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931025","headline":"Plot by Baghdad to Assassinate Bush Is Questioned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/world/plot-by-baghdad-to-assassinate-bush-is-questioned.html","abstract":"  The evidence of an Iraqi assassination plot against George Bush, the basis for a United States missile attack in June on the intelligence headquarters in Baghdad, was significantly weaker than the Clinton Administration asserted, a new article says.

In the performance of Mendelssohn's \"Italian\" Symphony, and even in the same composer's operatically demonstrative Overture to \"Ruy Blas,\" technique and incisiveness were less the point than comradely dedication. It was as if Mr. Masur and his players were saying: \"We are a community in agreement here.
