Something of the sort is suggested by such late works as the Requiem, \"La Clemenza di Tito\" and the F-minor organ fantasia, although proto-Romantic pieces from the same period indicate otherwise. Mozart's Baroque interests were inspired by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, a knowledgeable music patron who worked to buttress the failing reputations of Bach and Handel late in the 18th century. Mozart made arrangements of several Handel works for the baron's Baroque concerts; the last of these, \"Ode for St. Cecilia's Day,\" was performed at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday as part of a Baroque-oriented week of Mostly Mozart.   Adapting the \"Ode\" for Classical forces, Mozart added some inner voices but did not actively re-compose; there is nothing unmistakably Mozartean. Instead, one hears a rather anonymous, high-gloss \"modernization,\" inferior but not detrimental to Handel's original. Gerard Schwarz led an enthusiastic, extroverted account, with broad, operatic vocal work by the tenor Gary Lakes and, commandingly, the soprano Christine Brewer (both singing in German, although not the translation printed in the program). What I missed were the \"sharp violins\" of John Dryden's poem, the exact, passionate articulation on which this music thrives. The same lack of clarity bedeviled Handel's Concerto Grosso in B minor (Op. 6, No. 12), first on the program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940718","headline":"Rioting Evokes Days of Arab Uprising","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/world/rioting-evokes-days-of-arab-uprising.html","abstract":"  It was a scene from the past: Sirens blaring, ambulances carrying scores of wounded to hospitals, hundreds of youths throwing stones at Israeli soldiers who shot back with bullets and tear gas at the edge of the Gaza Strip.

The group used a drum set, two electric guitars, a bank of synthesizers and a bass. The only visual difference between Champloose and other rock bands was the three women in bright, flowing robes who stood at the front of the stage. They sang in a nasal falsetto that set every dog in the vicinity howling, and they danced and drummed indefatigably throughout the concert.

Conducting is entirely a cumulative art, whose outstanding practitioners reveal their mastery over the long haul, not in virtuosic instants. An episode like Leonard Bernstein's famous overnight success with the New York Philharmonic is a glaring exception. Generally speaking, there are no conducting prodigies, and many talents rise to greatness only in old age. A night of good conducting is, after all, merely the average of a hundred musicians' efforts, and a great conducting career the average of many thousands of such nights.   So it is very difficult to draw conclusions from a single set of performances, as the distinguished jury of the American Symphony Orchestra's Stokowski Conducting Competition had to do at a finals concert on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall. Yet it was not a futile exercise. One conductor did clearly stand out from two other finalists, although not enough for the jury to award a first prize. Jan Wagner, originally of Austria and now based in Minnesota, won second prize, and Steven Zike and Sebrina Alfonso shared third prize. Such overnight ranking is risky, but we undeniably need some new way of detecting podium talent; the old European system, with its long apprenticeships in provincial outposts, no longer provides a dependable hierarchy through which good conductors can surface.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Bank Regulator Says Clinton Sought Advice on S.& L.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/us/bank-regulator-says-clinton-sought-advice-on-s-l.html","abstract":"  President Clinton asked the nation's top bank regulator over the last New Year's holiday whether he could provide legal advice concerning the President's personal ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loan, according to an interagency memorandum written by the regulator.

The growth of the suburban elderly population is presenting an array of disturbing new problems for local governments, social service agencies, medical workers, businesses and families, all being forced to deal with the aging in a setting created for the young. A1.   VALLONE PRESSES FOR A POLICE MONITOR   City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said that he wants a permanent independent agency to monitor corruption in the New York City Police Department, and Council leaders said that he has the votes to push it through. A1.  NEW YORK CITY   LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR A TOWER SITE   An over-the-fence squabble between two powerful Bronx neighbors cooled a bit when Fordham University agreed to look for a different place to put its new radio tower, other than directly across the road from the New York Botanical Garden. B3.   TRANSIT POLICE VETO PROPOSED CONTRACT   The union for transit police officers rejected a tentative contract that the city and union leadership had announced last week, making it likely that the dispute will go before a state arbitration board. B3.   ANOTHER LEGIONNAIRES' CASE SUSPECTED   Another traveler on a New York cruise ship to Bermuda has been hospitalized with the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease, and the condition of two of the three of those with confirmed cases has worsened, New Jersey health and hospital officials said. B2.  REGION   BIKER CLASH LEAVES 2 DEAD   Perhaps 150 motorcycling enthusiasts were gathered in the picnic grove of an Elks Lodge in Hackettstown, N.J., on Sunday afternoon when arguments started near an outdoor beer and liquor stand. \"In rapid succession, it went from fists to knives, and from knives to guns,\" said the Warren County Prosecutor, John J. O'Reilly. The violence that erupted between two motorcycle clubs at the charity barbecue left two men dead and three wounded. B4.   YOUTH'S KILLING ATTRIBUTED TO ROUGH SEX   The youth accused of strangling his 12-year-old classmate at a school for emotionally disturbed children told detectives he put his hands around the boy's neck as the two engaged in rough sexual intercourse, investigators testified during a preliminary court hearing. B4.   DETECTIVES PLEAD GUILTY IN $10,000 THEFT   Three grim-faced former detectives of the Mount Vernon Police Department, who were videotaped in May stealing $10,000 in an F.B.I. sting operation, pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in White Plains to charges of theft and conspiracy. B4.

Mr. Murayama, 70, who came into office with about the lowest public approval rating of any postwar Prime Minister, focused on persuading the public that his Government was interested in more than seizing power and that the Socialists' far-left policies were a thing of the past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Another on Cruise Reports Possible Legionnaires' Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/nyregion/another-on-cruise-reports-possible-legionnaires-case.html","abstract":"  Another traveler on a New York cruise ship to Bermuda has been hospitalized with the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease, and the condition of two of the three of those with confirmed cases has worsened, New Jersey health and hospital officials said yesterday.

Goldman. Under California law, a double-murder conviction can warrant the death penalty. But most legal experts say, for a number of reasons, that if Mr. Simpson is convicted he may not be a strong candidate for capital punishment, which in California is by gas or lethal injection, with the choice given to the condemned person.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Scheming in the Interest Of Literacy and a Friend","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/theater/theater-review-scheming-in-the-interest-of-literacy-and-a-friend.html","abstract":"  Mingling old-fashioned innocence and contemporary calculation to charming and purposeful effect is \"The Great Brain,\" the new musical enlivening the summer season at the Promenade Theater, Broadway and 76th Street, under the auspices of the children's theater company Theaterworks/USA.   \"The Great Brain,\" adapted from a semiautobiographical story by John D.

In the greatest mass flight of people in modern times, more than a million Rwandans surged within 48 hours into neighboring Zaire. The town of Goma is now encircled by the world's largest refugee settlement, a distinction held only recently by the town of Ngara in Tanzania, where 250,000 Rwandans, most of them Hutus, fled in terror some weeks ago, fearing massacres by an advancing Tutsi-led rebel army. The total of refugees who have fled Rwanda is now estimated to be 2.1 million.   In Zaire, unlike Tanzania, few aid agencies are operating, and simply providing subsistence rations to the million Rwandans there is a colossal task. President Clinton has taken the right first step in sending Brian Atwood, the official of the American aid agency in charge of humanitarian relief, to Goma. The White House has approved 80 airlift missions and $31 million in emergency funds for food and medicine; this is in addition to $118 million in aid already airlifted to Rwanda.

He was reinstated by USA Track and Field in March 1994 after an appeal and competed in five events this year. But the federation stepped in and reimposed the ban after it realized Harris was running again.   \"Unfortunately, our doping office did not follow this case with sufficient attention,\" Nebiolo said. \"I regard the situation as an unfortunate one and one that caused me great disappointment.

Giuliani faced questions at a town meeting in Queens last night about police conduct, cuts in summer jobs, his Board of Education appointments and a deputy mayor's rhetoric.   The town meeting, Mr. Giuliani's seventh, was the first he had held in a predominantly black neighborhood. During the two hours, he was heckled as he defended Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, who had said City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi \"ought to know the difference between a bid and a watermelon\" during a dispute over whether the city should hire a financial firm owned by a black woman. Mr. Dyson subsequently apologized, saying he had not meant the comment as a racial slur. 'Take Him Out of Office'    \"You say you accept his apology,\" Al Haj Abdus-Alaam said to the Mayor from a microphone in Springfield Gardens High School. \"We say take him out of office.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940720","headline":"Familiar Late-Night Face For New Day: Tom Snyder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/20/arts/familiar-late-night-face-for-new-day-tom-snyder.html","abstract":"  After a 12 1/2-year hiatus, Tom Snyder is preparing to return to late-night network television.
