Ramiro Zaragoza, the young lawyer in charge, hired 33 inspectors, outfitted them in green windbreakers and began training them to take on the malfeasants. In Mexico City, officials announced a new dawn in the country's fight against pollution, new proof that if Mexico was allowed to join Canada and the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement it would not sacrifice its environment to attract business across the border. Toxic Legacy of Decades    But in Tijuana it was not that easy. Other agencies would not lend their files on the city's 700 industrial plants, officials in and outside the enforcement office say. Laboratory studies could not be done for lack of equipment or supplies. Then, for five months and without explanation, paychecks did not arrive. Mr. Zaragoza says he is as determined as ever, but only five of his inspectors are still on the job.   \"We've been bluffing,\" he said, sitting behind his desk and doing his best to smile. \"If they knew how few people we had, they would just laugh at us.\"   Faced with the toxic legacy of four decades of almost unregulated industrialization and desperate to win approval for the pending trade agreement, Mexico has taken extraordinary measures in the last few years to strengthen its environmental controls.   On Friday, Mexico, Canada and the United States also announced supplemental accords intended to insure the enforcement of Mexican labor and environmental standards under the agreement, which would eliminate most barriers to trade and investment among the three countries.   Supporters of the trade pact say the side accords will force compliance by investing three-nation labor and environment commissions with the power to impose fines and trade sanctions as penalties of last resort against Mexican violators. The proposed arbitration process is complicated and long, however, and many environmentalists emphasize that it will ultimately be up to the Mexican Government to see that its goal of rapid economic development for the country's 84 million people does not come at an enormous environmental cost. The Problem Is Huge    But despite hundreds of new inspectors, millions of dollars in environmental projects and many speeches by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declaring Mexico's commitment to protecting the environment, even some in the Government acknowledge that the country has only started, somewhat haltingly, to confront a problem of staggering proportions.   \"We have just begun to scratch the surface of what needs to be done,\" said the director of the National Institute of Ecology, Sergio Reyes Lujan.   Mexican ecological laws are viewed by many environmentalists as good and getting better. But a close look at Government environmental programs suggests that those laws are being undermined for reasons that may persist despite the new threat of trade sanctions.   While new environmental inspectors have fanned out across Mexico, their work continues to be hampered by insufficient and uncertain resources, political considerations and, at least occasionally, by corruption. Where the Government has cracked down on polluting industries, it has barely started to follow up with alternatives for those put out of business or incentives for steady compliance. Glaring Lack of Services    Strategies to limit the use of hazardous materials or otherwise prevent pollution are almost unheard of. And the public disclosure of information about companies' environmental practices is almost unimaginable.   As officials evoke images of a vast consumer market with boundless opportunities for investment, Mexico's lack of basic environmental services is glaring: in the Valley of Mexico, home to the capital and some 16 million people, almost nine-tenths of the waste water still goes untreated, according to Government figures. For some 60,000 industrial companies, there is a single toxic-waste landfill. There are no commercial incinerators for toxic wastes.   Mr. Reyes, a blunt-spoken physicist who has led Mexico's environmental efforts since 1986, can recall an agency that performed no inspections, did not even measure the air in Mexico City and got its first computer when he borrowed it from his 21-year-old son.  He is astonished by \"the rate of change,\" a phrase that has become his public mantra. The Border The Boom Is Clear, So's the Blight    Public debate in the United States is being driven largely by the experience of the border, where Government promises of a better tomorrow have a long, bitter past. Here, the dangers have already been vivid for two decades, as Mexico has drawn hundreds of foreign-owned industrial plants, called maquiladoras, with tariff, tax and other incentives.   In Ciudad Juarez, the problems are as plain as the great brown banks of smog that drift across the Rio Grande into El Paso, Tex. Elsewhere, they are sometimes less visible but more frightening: In Brownsville, Tex., an inexplicably high incidence of babies who are delivered stillborn without brains has led people to suspect contamination from industries just across the border in Matamoros, where the same phenomenon has appeared.   One fear that American environmentalists draw from the industrial boom along the border is that freer trade will mean more traffic, more industry and thus more pollution. But that focus underscores how little the accord's potential impact has been studied and how narrowly it has been seen.   Some economists believe that the crush of industry along the border could actually diminish under the agreement. But scant attention has been paid to the possible environmental effects on the Mexican interior of new activity in areas like agriculture, mining and forestry.   The new \"U.S.A.-style\" dry-cleaning outlets popping up around Mexico City hint at the vast range of problems. Unlike American dry cleaners, which are closely monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly all the Mexican operations dump their hazardous wastes in the trash, a franchise manager, Alberto Shamosh, said. He told of searching for months and then paying dearly to have a waste company from Guadalajara take away his chemical sludge.   Upholding the demands of some American environmental groups for a fuller accounting of the trade agreement's effects, a Federal judge ordered the Clinton Administration last month to provide a complete environmental impact assessment. The Administration has appealed the decision, which could delay carrying out the pact well beyond Jan. 1, when it is supposed to take effect. A ruling on the appeal is expected in late September.   Hoping to dispel pressure for such a study, the Bush Administration released a report last year dismissing the other major fear of American environmentalists: that a trade agreement might turn Mexico into a haven for industries trying to escape tougher environmental regulations to the north.   Environmental Protection Agency officials acknowledge that some furniture manufacturers, automobile paint shops and other businesses have already moved to Mexico for just this reason. They insist, though, that cheaper labor and lower environmental-regulation costs might defray the expense of relocation only for a tiny handful of industries that could be easily controlled. The Newcomers Laws Are Flouted, Reforms Touted    Tijuana is not convinced.   \"They have come here from all over, saying they are going to invest, that they are going to help us,\" said Maurilio Sanchez, a community organizer in Ejido Chilpancingo, a dusty sprawl of tarpaper and brick that sits just below a big maquiladora park on the city's outskirts. \"But when it comes to complying with the ecological laws, they say they cannot speak Spanish.\"    For the most part, Mr. Sanchez said, the authorities ignore him. But they have been paying more attention since March 8, when sewer openings in the neighborhood exploded and he led a clutch of firemen and inspectors to a waste recycling business in the industrial park.   Just as the posse arrived, the company's owner and two workers were pouring barrels of toxic chemicals down a sewer drain. Investigators concluded that they had been doing so for years.   By law, the foreign-owned plants are obliged to ship their hazardous wastes back out of Mexico for disposal. In practice, officials say, there is a flourishing traffic in waste-dumping. A United States Congressional study last year found that fewer than one-third of the plants even reported on their wastes as required and that the reports went virtually unchecked.   Compared with even two years ago, Mexican officials assert, their ability to track and control such problems has taken a giant leap forward.   At one point in 1991, according to Government figures, the country's environmental agency had seven inspectors assigned to 15,000 industries in Mexico City. Under the new agency set up last fall, the office of the Attorney General for Environmental Protection, inspections officially jumped from 1,380 in all of 1989 to 6,937 in the first four months of this year.   While many environmentalists consider those figures suspect, there is no dispute that tens of millions of dollars have been committed to new sewage treatment plants, new landfills, new air-quality monitoring programs. More than 200 new environmental regulations are being written or rewritten with the help of international consultants. The Inspectors Paltry Resources (And No Paycheck)    In their campaign to push the trade accord through the American Congress this fall, Mexican and American officials have promised to channel billions more dollars to clean up both sides of the 2,000-mile border. And World Bank officials say they will lend as much as $600 million to support Mexico's environmental projects and agencies over the next several years.   But to follow two conscientious young federal inspectors on their rounds is to wonder about the effectiveness of the new force.   Puttering up Tijuana's hills in a Volkswagen bug, the inspectors -- Aidee Solano, clad in her green windbreaker and jeans, and Carlos Padilla, clad in just the jeans -- make their way to Bronzart S.A., a maker of bronze statuettes that moved in eight months ago from Southern California.   They tell the plant manager they simply want to take a look around, see the manufacturing process, check on the disposal of wastes.   \"Just like in Los Angeles,\" he says, \"right?\"   But after that welcome comparison, the manager indicates that he expected things to be a little different. Unlike in California, he has not bothered to clean out his waste water or have it treated. He is not sure what to do with the refuse from his smelting operation, he says, so it is piled up in a big mound behind the plant.   Shouting over the roar of machines, Miss Solano, who studied biology in college, questions a supervisor about the chemicals in the big drums. She asks for and receives information on each, but does not bother with samples; there is no laboratory to perform the analysis.   After five months without a paycheck, it seems heroic that the inspectors show up for work at all. In similar straits, two inspectors in the Ciudad Juarez office were recently dismissed after complaints that they unsuccessfully solicited big bribes at a local engine plant.    The head of the Juarez office was dismissed as well. But according to some Mexican and American environmental officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, his more serious failing may have been to push hard for inspections against the wishes of superiors afraid of angering local businessmen on the eve of a national presidential campaign.   Government officials denied that charge. They do not dispute, however, that the minister in charge of development programs and environmental affairs, Luis Donaldo Colosio, is considered a leading contender for the governing party's nomination and many of his subordinates campaign intensely, if quietly, on his behalf.  The Prospects Some Pray the Pact Will Bring Converts    Much as they have complained about the shortcomings of Mexican enforcement, many environmentalists acknowledge that more rigorous inspection of manufacturing plants is only one of the needed improvements in the country's environmental controls. \"The question is whether, when the factories reopen, anything has really changed,\" J. Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said in an interview in Washington.   Among the statistics that Salinas Administration officials routinely hand out, there is no count of follow-up inspections. Efforts are under way to make industries pay for their own waste treatment, and in what supporters of the trade agreement hail as a sign of the environmental cooperation it will encourage, Mexican officials and Los Angeles County prosecutors in June forced an American company to pay $2.5 million to clean up lead wastes from the battery-recycling plant it operated outside Tijuana.   But for now, pollution-prevention efforts are almost nonexistent, and incentive-based solutions to specific pollution problems are just getting off the drawing board.   In a 1991 study often quoted by Mexican officials, two Princeton University economists, Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, conclude that \"economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems once a country's per capita income reaches about $4,000 to $5,000\" -- Mexico's level now.   To many Mexican and American environmentalists, the study, prepared for a conference sponsored by the Mexican trade ministry, smacks of wishful thinking. But if changing attitudes is more complex a matter than the average amount of money in people's pockets, more and more American environmentalists have come to support the trade pact on the ground that it might strengthen Mexicans' environmental awareness along with their economy.   Just across from El Paso, where the pressure is building for binational solutions to the air-pollution problem, a brickmaker in Ciudad Juarez, Pedro Gonzalez, lent support for this thesis. He was describing the Government's insistence that he stop burning tires and sawdust in his kiln and start burning propane gas.   \"The truth is, all of this is happening because the gabachos are pressuring us,\" he said of the move toward cleaner fuels, using slang for Americans. \"But we have families, too.

Thursday night, and he made the most of it. The group -- Mr. Baron on drums, Steve Swell on trombone and Ellery Eskalin on tenor saxophone -- played music that at times seemed to be coming through a stereo operating on half its channels. At other times Mr. Baron tried to sound like a band, full and complete. And since there isn't much literature for this instrumentation, Mr. Baron was referential, drawing on jazz and soul and funk.   It's an old conceit, to be catholic in one's sources, but Mr. Baron pulled it off, in part because he's so gifted a drummer. He would spell out ideas with just a ride cymbal, or use his hands quietly on the skins of the drums, or tap out figures with one wooden stick on a metal rim. Everything he did was small, as if he'd distilled the few gestures it takes to suggest a style.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Amid Maze of Signals, Bats' Brains Can Form Precise Images of Prey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/science/amid-maze-of-signals-bats-brains-can-form-precise-images-of-prey.html","abstract":"  PEOPLE who grew up before television had little difficulty \"seeing\" the Green Hornet, the Lone Ranger or Baby Snooks on radio. But can insect-eating bats, relying solely on sound signals to find food, form comparable mental images of their prey to help them distinguish a delicious moth, say, from the leaves it flutters through?   Neurobiologists at Brown University have found that a bat can in fact form quite precise acoustical images of the many objects in its aerial environment. In the so-called tonotopic area of the auditory cortex, the part of the brain that processes sound signals, the scientists have pinpointed nerve cells that enable the bat to discern the exact size, shape and movements of insects in its path.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930817","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Ronald Searle, the caricaturist is reading \"The Kenneth Williams Diaries,\" edited by Russell Davies. .\"Forty years of diaries left by a popular comic who was, in fact, a suicidal mixed-up loner.

But what was supposed to be a celebration of fruit and free trade is fast becoming a major source of friction between Washington and Tokyo. The apple farmers here in the nation's most productive fruit-growing region, who have spent more than decade setting up 3,500 acres of orchards to meet Japan's standards, now say they have been betrayed. Isolated Apple Orchards    Concerned about protecting its own highly lucrative apple-growing industry, Japan has long insisted that American fruit be free of any insects that might cross the Pacific. American farmers say most of Japan's pest concerns are phony, used as a convenient trade barrier. Still, until now, the Americans have dutifully done everything the Japanese said they would have to do to get their fruit into Japan.   American apple growers planted trees that were isolated from other orchards to minimize possible contact with insects. Special traps for bugs were set up. And some of the fruit has been individually wrapped in paper while still on the tree.   All was set for this year's breakthrough crop. But then, earlier this summer, Japan raised fresh concerns about pests that the American growers say are nonexistent.   Infuriated, the apple farmers of Washington State, who raise half the nation's crop and ship their fruit to 24 countries, including several in Asia, have taken the first step to bring trade sanctions against Japan. They are also talking about smashing Japanese electronic products in symbolic acts of defiance.   And at a recent food fair in Japan, American apple growers had a barren display with a sign that read, \"Empty boxes, empty promises.\"   \"We have gone through every hoop they have asked us to go through, and we're just fed up,\" said Doug Pauly, an apple grower and shipper here. \"We've had people tearing out pear trees and vineyards and rose bushes so they wouldn't be near these special orchards. Then, we get this close and the Japanese move the goal posts again. We can't win.\"   Apples are to Japanese and American trade policy what intercontinental missiles were to the cold war. Both sides have them. They have long been a bargaining chip. And now one side says it is time to put up or shut up.   In Japan, where a single apple can cost up to $5 at a fruit stand, American apples are forbidden by a long-standing agricultural policy that requires importers to prove that the produce is free of insects. The Americans say they have done this, but the Japanese say other scientific concerns remain.   The Americans, from the growers here to the highest reaches of the Clinton Administration, say it is a clear-cut issue. As such, apples have become the symbol of President Clinton's effort to open Japanese markets by appealing to the consumer. Gains for Both Countries    American apples would be a bargain to the Japanese consumer, while bringing huge profits to growers here. The growers had expected to sell up to 700,000 42-pound boxes, offering Japanese consumers the red and golden Delicious variety of apples at roughly half the price of Japan's major domestically grown variety, the Fuji. If, as expected, the growers were to get from $75 to $100 a box, it would bring them more than four times what they would receive in this country.   Two weeks ago, the Administration demanded that Japan take steps to import American apples beginning with next year's crop.   \"The U.S. side, for its part, has bent over backwards to accommodate Japanese concerns,\" Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Mike Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, wrote in a letter to Masami Tanabu, Japan's Agriculture Minister. The American officials demanded a \"written Japanese commitment\" of all the steps needed for apples to get into Japan next year.   The Japanese, who already import a small amount of apples from New Zealand, have yet to respond to the specific complaints of the letter. Nor have they explained why these new insect questions were raised at the 11th hour. In a brief letter to the Clinton Administration they said the recent change in Government in Japan would delay an answer to the questions.   In the past, Japanese agriculture officials raised concerns about the possibility of pests infecting their own fruit if American apples were allowed into Japan. And they have denied that apples were being kept out for political reasons.   \"What Japan needs is for the the United States to prove that its apples are safe,\" KenjiNOr Nakano, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said in an interview. \"This is not a political issue. It is purely a technical one.\"   With the United States running a $50 billion trade deficit with Japan, apples are a relatively small item on the bargaining table. But, as Mr. Kantor said in his letter, the issue has become \"highly symbolic.\"   He raised the issue last month in talks between the two governments during Mr. Clinton's trip to Japan. In the American view, Japan bans United States apples for only one reason: to protect their own farmers.   Washington State's 3,500 apple farmers produce twice as many apples as their Japanese counterparts. But Japan has more than 10 times as many apple farmers, who raise their fruit on small plots and receive high prices for the produce, primarily Fuji apples.   Nor do they see any market logic behind Japanese protectionism. They contend that Washington apples, marketed for lunch buckets and snacks, would not cut into the markets of Japanese growers because the addition of American varieties would complement the more delicate Japanese product, change eating habits and expand the market.   They point to past food barriers on cherries and beef, which were lifted to the satisfaction of farmers in both countries. The success of Pacific Northwest cherries, which sometimes sell for as much as $1 a cherry in Japan, has fueled the drive by American growers to get into the lucrative Japanese market.   \"Here you have an industry that has played by the rules, done everything right, and in the end still cannot get into Japan,\" said Bill Bryant, an agricultural trade consultant in Seattle. \"Now it's becoming symbolic of blatant, unfair trading policies.\"   Of particular concern to the Japanese officials in the past has been whether American apples might carry a pest known as the coddling moth. The growers here say any such pests are killed during cold storage, when the apples, before shipment, are kept in a dark room at near freezing temperatures with almost no oxygen.   But after the coddling moth issue was satisfied, the Japanese raised a new concern about fire blight, a bacteria that typically infects pears. They wanted to make sure that no pear trees were grown near the apples; the Washington growers complied, planting orchards that were at least 500 meters, or nearly 1,641 feet, from pear trees.   Since then, new pest issues have been raised. \"We call it the bug-of-the-month club,\" Mr. Pauly said.   The Japanese say that even if these pests have not shown up in American fruit, their precaution is warranted by the need to protect their own produce from foreign insects.   Although they demanded that Japan take steps that would lead to apple imports by next year's harvest, some growers here have given up hope that diplomacy will work. They want to use the stick of reciprocal trade sanctions.   As for all those well-tended apples fattening on isolated trees near the Columbia River -- perhaps as many as 25 million pieces of fruit -- the growers say they will try to sell them to some other country. But given the cost it has taken to grow them, they say, they may not break even.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/nyregion/c-corrections-902493.html","abstract":"  An article on July 24 about the ouster of an executive of Disabled American Veterans misstated the number of veterans' organizations chartered by Congress.

If Clark finds that the salary cap rules were violated, heavy fines could be levied.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Kidnapped Executive Is Rescued After 13 Days in Manhattan Crypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/nyregion/kidnapped-executive-is-rescued-after-13-days-in-manhattan-crypt.html","abstract":"  The 68-year-old chairman of the nation's largest manufacturer of tuxedos was found buried alive in a barrel-shaped bunker between the Hudson River and a heavily traveled highway in Manhattan yesterday after being kidnapped 12 days earlier, the police said.

In the 20 years that the Clean Air Act has mandated unleaded gas use in the United States, the lead accumulation worldwide has diminished significantly.    A study published recently in the journal Nature shows that airborne leaded gas emissions from the United States were the leading contributor to the high concentration of lead in the snow in Greenland. The new study is a result of the continued research led by Dr. Charles Boutron, an expert on the impact of heavy metals on the environment at the Laboratory of Glaciology and Environmental Geophysics of the National Center for Scientific Research in St.-Martin-d'Heres, France. A study by Dr. Boutron published in Nature in 1991 showed that lead levels in arctic snow were declining.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Enlisting Termites To Fight Infestation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/science/enlisting-termites-to-fight-infestation.html","abstract":"  USING a new technique, exterminators may soon be able to rid homes of destructive termites by turning the wood-eating pests into assassins.   The new method first enlists unwitting subterranean termites by luring them with food, in this case, corrugated cardboard tubes, said Dr. Tim Myles, director of the urban entomology program at the University of Toronto, who conducted the research. When they enter the tube, the termites release hormones, called pheromones, which attract more termites. Within a week, more than 5,000 subterranean termites are in each six-inch-wide, six-inch-long tube at any given moment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930817","headline":"Azinger Arrives At Top","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/17/sports/golf-azinger-arrives-at-top.html","abstract":"  Major championships, for all their importance to the game, are often inconclusive once the cheering stops.

He may not have known why faddish drugs work on credulous patients, but the fact that they do has been borne out by scientists studying the power of the placebo to cure.   New findings show that the placebo effect -- in which patients given an inactive treatment believe it can cure them -- is most powerful when a trusted physician enthusiastically offers a patient a new therapy. In a study of more than 6,000 patients being given experimental treatments for asthma, duodenal ulcer and herpes, two-thirds improved, at least temporarily, even though rigorous tests later found the treatments medically useless.

Gonzalez unloaded a monstrous three-run homer off Perez that spoiled his shutout attempt and ruined the chance for a sweep as the Rangers snatched a 3-2 victory.
