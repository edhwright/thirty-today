It makes a real difference not only to Americans without insurance but also in containing the costs of health care. President Clinton knows that, and surely did not want to delay full coverage. But he evidently chose to do so because he has decided to finance the program out of savings in the cost of health care delivery rather than out of taxes.

A series of hypothetical examples outline the current and projected costs of insurance coverage for a number of families or individuals in varying circumstances. Here are excerpts from the report, with White House's description and cost estimates. TWO-PARENT FAMILY YEARLY COST TO FAMILY NOW: Mary Sampson manages a small law office in San Jose, California. She makes $35,000 a year. Her husband, a minister, makes $30,000 a year. Today, they get their coverage through Mary's employer, who pays half their premium. They pay $2,940 a year, 8 percent of her salary, for their health care premiums alone, not including co-payments and deductibles. CLINTON PLAN: Assuming they choose an average-priced plan, the premium for Mary Sampson and her husband will be around $872 a year, or $73 a month. They could choose a higher cost plan, which would cost them more, or a 1ower cost plan, which would cost them less. COUPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW: Dennis and Barbara Rutherford, who live in Hannibal, Missouri have a combined income of $21,200. Dennis was laid off from his high paying job with a large manufacturing firm in late 1990. At that time, both Rutherfords lost their health care coverage. They have been turned down for other coverage because of preexisting conditions -- Dennis' high blood pressure and Barbara's history of breast cancer. Since then, they have been unable to afford the $9,000 a year ($750 a month) premium offered by the only plan that will accept   them.  CLINTON PLAN: If Dennis and Barbara enrolled in an average priced plan, they would pay 20 percent of the $3,865 annual premium for a couple -- $773 a year, or $64 a month.  SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Sara Bender, a 28-year-old broadcast journalist, lives in Columbus, Ohio, and makes $34,000 a year. Because she works for a firm which gets a lower cost premium for its healthy workers, she has been paying only $300 a year, or $25 a month for her health care coverage. CLINTON PLAN: If Sara enrolled in an average cost plan she would pay 20% of the $1,932 annual premium for a single policy -- $386 a year, or $32 a month. SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Susan Addington is a single parent living in Virginia. She is self-employed with an income of $40,000 a year. Because her son has a serious chronic illness, she paid $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs and $5,000 in insurance premiums in just one year. Because she is selfemployed, she was only able to deduct 25% of her $5,000 premium or $1,250 of these costs. CLINTON PLAN: For the family share of her premium, for an average-priced plan, Susan will pay 20% of the $3,893 annual premium for a single parent family-- $779 a year. She will also pay the employer share for a single parent -- $2,479, for a total of $3,258-a-year or $272 a month. And she will be able to deduct 100 percent of the premium. PROFESSIONAL COUPLE NOW: Michael and Elizabeth Sands work and live in Memphis, Tennessee, and together earn almost $90,000 a year. Elizabeth is a graphic artist, making $40,000. Although Elizabeth's firm offers her health insurance, the couple chooses to receive their coverage through the architectural firm where Michael works, because it provides a more generous, comprehensive benefits package. Today the Sands pay $720 a year, or $60 a month, for this coverage. The total premium costs $4,400 a year, and the architecture firm pays the rest. CLINTON PLAN: The Sands want to stay with their current plan. Under reform, this plan will cost less than it does today because it wiII no longer pay for the uncompensated care delivered to the uninsured, saving 10 percent of the current premium cost. The average cost of a couple premium in the Sands' alliance is $3,865 but the Sands pick a plan that will cost $4,000. They will pay the dffference between 80 percent of the average cost plan, which is $3092, and $4,000, or $908 a year, $75 a month. LOW INCOME FAMILY NOW: Lars and Brenda Gustafson recently had a new baby, and Brenda resigned from her job shortly before the baby was born. Lars works for a messenger service in Minneapolis, Minnesota and takes home about $250 a week, or $13,000 a year. His employer does not offer him health insurance. As a result, he and his family have been uninsured for two years. CLINTON PLAN: Provided Lars and Brenda choose an average price plan, they will pay 20 percent of $4,360 or $872 for a two-parent family policy. But because Lars is in a two-parent family with income less than $14,781 a year, he is eligible for a discount, reducing his premium to $384 a year. FARMERS NOW: James Huggins, a self-employed family farmer in Kansas, makes $25,000 a year and has struggled to pay for health care coverage for himself, his wife and his 10-year-old son. He is only able to deduct one fourth of the $4,000 he pays in premiums each year. CLINTON PLAN: If James enrolls in an average cost plan, he will pay 20 percent of the $4,360 annual family premium or $872 a year. Like a business, James will also pay the employer share of his premium, which would normally be $2,479.

On the face of it, Mr. Glass's two-act piece is an interpretation of an interpretation, a gloss on a gloss. And indeed, there are places in it -- Orphee's pursuit of the Princess on the streets of Paris is one -- that mean little without the corresponding images created on film 43 years ago. Condensing here, implying there, \"Orphee\" the opera follows the train of Cocteau's thoughts on a very ancient myth. It uses much of his dialogue verbatim.   Yet in another sense, Mr. Glass's piece is closer to Gluck than to Cocteau. Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice,\" written in 1762, is opera's most prominent hommage to the Orpheus myth. Although the new opera's reference to an old one is brief and fleeting, the flute solo with orchestra that announces the Princess's entrance from the Underworld seems, intentionally or not, more a comment on the music around it then a passing bow to history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"At Airports, Life in the Slow Lane","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/style/IHT-at-airports-life-in-the-slow-lane.html","abstract":"I HAVE a recurring nightmare of waiting behind two dozen people in the check-in line at a strange airport.

Everything improved: the seating, the service, the size of the portions.

The explanation is that although potential audiences for \"Tennessee\" were eager enough to supply the play with a substantial advance sale, the drop at the box office when the reviews came out -- they weren't terrible, just reserved -- was immediate and huge. Fans of the Irish playwright Brian Friel and his lyrical, understated, obliquely emotional dramas, the theory goes, had already bought their tickets; his reputation had carried the play as far as it was going to, and the show needed the buzz of critical rapture to assume the burden, as it had with Mr. Friel's previous Broadway offering, \"Dancing at Lughnasa.\" On Monday, however, the day after \"Tennessee\" opened, less than $8,000 worth of tickets was sold, a dooming total for a show with weekly operating costs of more than $135,000.

For others, its appeal should be as a cheeky if predictable sendup of erotic obsession and its unhappy consequences.   \"Sex and Zen,\" which opened today at the Cinema Village, is based on Li Yu's novel \"The Carnal Prayer Mat,\" an erotic work that was banned for centuries in China. It follows the sexual swath cut by Mei Yeung Sheng (Lawrence Ng), a knight-errant in fanatical pursuit of ultimate pleasure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"Ballot Issues in Three Regions Debt Questions for New Yorkers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/opinion/ballot-issues-in-three-regions-debt-questions-for-new-yorkers.html","abstract":"  Albany seeks voter approval next week for three constitutional amendments to ease restrictions on New York State and local borrowing.

In its wildly expressionistic opening sequence, Catherine (Jade Leung), a waitress in an eerie, blue-lighted truck stop, goes berserk when a customer makes a pass at her, killing him and a police officer who has been called to the scene. At her arraignment, Catherine shoots her way out of a Los Angeles courtroom in a blitz of gunfire. Moments later, she is kidnapped by the C.I.A., which implants a microchip in her brain and trains her to become a political assassin with the code name Black Cat.   The film, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, makes no pretenses toward realism: the film is a Hong Kong answer to \"La Femme Nikita\" and its American remake, \"Point of No Return.\" \"Black Cat\" is a stylish pop fantasy spun around an invincible female action hero.

Working entirely with the bright and mostly worthless trinkets to be found in souvenir stores, gift shops, toy stores and party-decoration outlets, Mr. Mantello has turned the gallery into maze of zany installations and overloaded assemblage sculptures. He has also painted some walls hot pink, covered others with wallpaper or with blown-up resort photographs, and levitated helium balloons all over the place. Disco music emanates from one work, air freshener from another. With repeated appearances of fake food -- hamburger-shaped yo-yos, plastic bagels, chocolate-kiss pinatas, furry ice cream cones and elaborately iced cakes that the artist makes himself -- there is virtually no sense that isn't aroused, or at least assaulted. Take the young ones, but stick around, for this is a show that grows on grown-ups, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"Review/Film; A Lust for the (Supposedly) Lifeless","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/movies/review-film-a-lust-for-the-supposedly-lifeless.html","abstract":"Zombie's splattering rampage.

But this week Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister-elect, resurrected the threat. That's unfortunate, because renegotiation could bury Nafta -- an important pact that would raise living standards in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. and lock Mexico into its pro-market reforms. The threat is also unnecessary, because Nafta doesn't bear on the trade issues that disturb Mr. Chretien the most.    The dispute is mostly about subsidies the Canadian Government gives industries like wheat and lumber. These subsidies are designed to solve domestic problems, like bailing out flagging industries and developing downtrodden regions.

He will have to lead the fight for more state school aid, while coming up with $1.2 billion to pay for a five-year backlog in school maintenance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931030","headline":"In Burundi, Partition Can End the Bloodshed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/30/opinion/l-in-burundi-partition-can-end-the-bloodshed-182193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The coup and killings in Burundi are regrettable, but were predictable.

On Thursday night in Carnegie Hall, the orchestra that once seemed an extension of Herbert von Karajan's gesturing arms gave the first of three New York concerts conducted by Karajan's successor, Claudio Abbado. It was the first time since 1982 that the orchestra had played in New York under its own music director (visits in 1986 and 1991 were led by James Levine and Bernard Haitink, respectively). And it was the first time New Yorkers could hear how Mr. Abbado has been shaping this great instrument since he became its caretaker and leader in 1989.   The orchestra looks younger, but its sonic tradition has not been radically modified; it was still recognizably the instrument heard in recordings and previous concerts. The famous sleek strings still had an astonishing elegance; the orchestra as a whole could give a polished, glorious three-dimensional body to sound.
