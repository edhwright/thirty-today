The talks, which broke off here Saturday afternoon, were the third consecutive round to end in stalemate. But in contrast to the vows of good faith with which earlier meetings ended, the negotiators accused one another this time of setting the stage for fiercer fighting in a war that is thought to have claimed at least 100,000 lives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/nyregion/bridge-778393.html","abstract":"  The Cavendish Invitational Pairs, including many of America's best players, began Saturday at Loew's Hotel, Lexington Avenue and 51st Street in Manhattan, and continued yesterday . At the midpoint the leaders were: in first place, Bill Eisenberg of Boca Raton, Fla., and Martin Scheinberg of Manhattan, plus 953 imps; in second, Ron Gerard of White Plains and Mike Kamil of Teaneck, N.J., plus 933; in third, Fred Stewart of Accord, N.Y., and Steve Weinstein of Upper Montclair, N.J., plus 840.   In the most interesting deal of the first day's play, Gerard as South landed in five clubs doubled on the diagramed deal. He ruffed the opening heart lead, cashed the club ace and gave up a club to West. Another heart lead was ruffed, and he finessed the spade queen successfully. Dummy's last heart was ruffed and three more trump leads left this ending: [ Diagram ] .   When the last trump was led, West was forced to part with the diamond three. Gerard now threw the spade nine from the dummy and led the diamond ten. West took the ace, but South took the last two tricks with the spade ace and the diamond king. The victims of Gerard's fine play were Piotr Gawrys and Krysztof Lasocki, the Polish partnership that almost won the event a year ago.

But although there were stylistic gulfs between these works, there was a curious undercurrent common to them all. Each work seemed to be propelled by a set of inner conflicts, by competing impulses pulling against each other.    In the case of Donald Martino's Set for Clarinet (1954), those impulses were the desire to draw on popular forms -- jazz and blues -- but to do so within a language of rigorous atonality, and to shine a spotlight on a clarinetist's virtuosity without losing sight of the work's compositional ingenuity.

Elizabeth Brown's \"Memory Palace\" (1990), for flute, cello and piano, uses a tonally freewheeling language (neither strictly rooted nor fully atonal) and an abstract structure to paint a distinct, if fanciful, picture in which thematic relationships come increasingly into focus as the piece unfolds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"Marshak Memorial Service","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/us/marshak-memorial-service.html","abstract":"  City College will hold a memorial service for President Emeritus Robert Eugene Marshak at 3 P.M.

Mr. Matura has moved J. M. Synge's \"extravagant comedy,\" originally set in the County Mayo of 1907, to Mayaro, Trinidad, in 1950. As boisterously animated at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, this tropical community is a little too close for comfort to Gilligan's Island.   Even so, the script, which has been widely produced since its premiere in 1984, is clever and sometimes legitimately amusing. Mr. Matura is an elegant writer whose other plays can recall the novels of his fellow Trinidadian V. S. Naipaul in their ironic political undertow. Here he so faithfully and musically translates the rich Irish language of the original text into a lilting Caribbean patois that his verbal ingenuity recalls Richard Wilbur's stunning English translations of Moliere. For all the alterations, which include the transformation of a pub into a rum shop and of the Widow Quin into a superstitious folk priestess (Michele Shay), \"Playboy\" still tells of a young stranger, now called Ken (Victor Love) instead of Christy, who briefly earns the adoration of an impoverished town by confessing to having committed parricide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"Sports of The Times; There's a Not-So-Secret Word at Shea These Days: Boo!","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/sports/sports-of-the-times-there-s-a-not-so-secret-word-at-shea-these-days-boo.html","abstract":"  In the rottenest of times, when it appeared that the sky over Queens was falling, when his batters couldn't bat, his pitchers couldn't hurl, his players were casually making idiots of themselves on and off the field, and the Shea Stadium fans were like a surly mob, Frank Cashen, then the general manager of the Mets, had a saying: \"Just another day in Paradise.\"   Return with us now to Paradise: The Mets sank three fathoms deeper into last place below the Marlins yesterday as the fresh fish from Miami -- the expansion franchise that is all of one month old -- ate up the Mets again, for the second straight day in their three meetings, this time by a score of 6-4.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"The Papp and Festival Archives Go to New York Public Library","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/theater/the-papp-and-festival-archives-go-to-new-york-public-library.html","abstract":"  The archives of the New York Shakespeare Festival and the personal papers of its founder, Joseph Papp, believed to be the largest and most complete collection ever assembled of a postwar American theater organization, have been donated to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, the library has announced.

Finished in 1883 -- midway between the composition of \"Eugene Onegin\" and \"The Queen of Spades\" -- this merger of historical cataclysm, Verdian love conflicts and Donizettian mad scenes largely abjures the smooth beauties of its two more famous companions.   In \"Mazeppa\" -- which the Opera Orchestra of New York offered in concert at Carnegie Hall the night of May 2 -- the usually fastidious Tchaikovsky gets his hands dirty. It is not the constant presence of Russian and Ukrainian country tunes that is so striking; it is the directness of their presentation: their feeling of sweat and simple labor. Absent is the well-groomed folkloric charm that in \"Onegin\" becomes a kind of prop.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"1 Man Killed, 2 Wounded","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/nyregion/1-man-killed-2-wounded.html","abstract":"  One man was shot to death and two were wounded in the Washington Heights area of Manhattan yesterday, the police said.

The police estimated that the observance drew 73,000 spectators. There were no reports of arrests, though a scattering of demonstrators protested the exclusion of the gay marchers.

The authorities announced that two suspects had been indicted in the murder, and law-enforcement officials said that five others had been arrested in the conspiracy but that the indictments against them had been sealed. A1. The Cali cocaine cartel is a strong and brutal presence in Jackson Heights. B2. 17 MONTHS LATER, ANOTHER SON IS KILLED    A Marine Corps recruiting sergeant home on leave for Mother's Day was shot and killed as he sat on a Bronx park bench a few feet from the spot where his only brother was shot and killed 17 months ago. B3. CHOICE BETWEEN RIVALS TROUBLES DINKINS   An effort to forge a black-Hispanic coalition to bolster Mayor Dinkins's re-election campaign has led to a standoff between a black and a Hispanic candidate for the city's No. 2 office and put the Mayor in a delicate bind between political calculation and old loyalties. B3. A majority of the New York City Board of Education lined up to elect Carol A. Gresser, a longtime parent association leader in Queens, as the next board president, but Mayor Dinkins made a last-minute plea to delay the vote. B3.

B4. DUN & BRADSTREET TO MOVE STAFF   In what Connecticut officials hailed as a victory for their economic-development campaign, Dun & Bradstreet, the financial information company, said that it had accepted a $7.2 million grant from Hartford and would move its headquarters staff of 300 people from midtown Manhattan to Wilton, Conn.

Sampras is playing in his second tournament on clay this season and his first on the slower, red surface in Europe. He was generally satisfied with his game in the 1-hour-39-minute match, especially for having staved off a third set on a hot, sunny day at the Foro Italico. Sampras saved a set point when the 50th-ranked Furlan returned a deep service into the net, and the American later ended the match with an ace in the tie breaker. Fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who is also more accustomed to faster surfaces, defeated Jaime Oncins, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, and then called the victory his best match of his injury-plagued season. Jan Siemerink beat No. 12-seeded MaliVai Washington, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), to score the first upset in the $1.75 million tournament. Scheduled to play their opening matches today are second-seeded Jim Courier, the defending champion at the Italian Open, and third-seeded Boris Becker, who has won only two matches in four clay-court tournaments this spring. Meanwhile, the ATP Tour announced it was conducting anti-doping tests during the Italian Open, the first time since implementing stricter penalties in March.

The individual fibers in yarns are made of long polymer chains, or strands of giant molecules, according to Dr. Lemley, who is a chemist.

Before last night's game against the visiting Florida Marlins, the club was 1-6 in one-run games, without a victory in extra innings and 3-10 in its last 13 games at Shea Stadium. The Mets average stood at .230 and the bullpen was 0-7. So the Mets aren't in last place because of unrealized potential, but because of fully realized shortcomings. Any notion that the Mets can be rehabilitated in 1993 requires a great leap of faith, and the Mets Aren't too good at any kind of leaping these days. MANAGER WATCH    The mananger won't be fired any time soon, or so ownership has said. Jeff Torborg, above, whose relaxed approach has come perilously close to becoming a detached approach, has done nothing to shake up his club. There has been talk of togetherness, of effort. It is only talk, and when it comes from Torborg, the players seem to ignore it. DUGOUT DECOMPRESSION    Bobby Bonilla, right, the Met's first baseman of the future, might benefit from some time on the bench. His strikeout total is escalating disturbingly. The umpires don't have a good word to say about him; Shea fans say mostly boo, and maybe Bonilla and Mike Cubbage need to spend some quality time in the dugout talking over the game's finer points. HEY, BOBBY, SAY HI TO VINCE    Speed. Speed. Speed. Manufactured runs. Menace on the basepaths. New York has heard enough about Vince Coleman's potential threat and seen not nearly enough. The leadoff man had a .285 on-base percentage before last night. Why not sit Coleman, get Joe Orsulak in a more comfortable spot in left, get center fielder Dave Gallagher's bat (.391) in the lineup for a couple of weeks and make the Mets a decent defensive team. TRADE EMBARGO    The Mets say trading any significant player right now is impractical. Howard Johnson, right, has too much to prove at the moment to command from other clubs the value the Mets would want in return. Trading Sid Fernandez, even after his surgery, might net a useful player, but would leave a gaping hole in the No. 3 spot in the rotation. \"The best we could probably do would be one of those change-of-scenery types of deals where both clubs would be taking huge gambles,\" said one official. 30 DAYS OF GOOD BEHAVIOR    The Mets are one month of bad baseball away from 1993 irrelevance. They play the Cardinals and Expos this week and the Pirates and Phillies before the end of May. If they are 12 or more games out by then, the Mets are over and out. ONE MORE STOP BEFORE COOPERSTOWN    The Mets, if they fail to mount an assault on repectability this month, could make the trading of Eddie Murray their first order of bargain-basement business. The first baseman's numbers are still high enough to give him marketplace value. Would the Braves, who need offense and who have a ton of prospects, be interested? AN UNEVEN ODD YEAR    Bret Saberhagen, who began the year with a 74-30 career record in odd-numbered years, has only three victories this season, all against expansion teams. The right-hander has struggled to find his blowaway fastball and has had an occasionally cranky right shoulder. \"I've been pitching stupid and I'm sick and tired of it,\" Saberhagen said last week. \"My 7-year-old son has a better idea of how to pitch than I've had the last month.\" FOR PETE'S SAKE    Perhaps Pete Schourek, the left-hander with the 1-3 record, would profit from a stint in the bullpen, or the minors. Let Eric Hillman start a couple of games, fool some teams, maybe and meanwhile reignite Schourek's focus and talent. And why not promote Kevin Baez and reassign backup infielder Tim Bogar? CHAPTER 11, FILING AT DEADLINE    The Mets, if they are in the middle of nowhere in mid-summer, might declare their season bankrupt and stage a liquidation sale at the trading deadline. Johnson and Fernandez might garner a fair ransom of young talent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930511","headline":"Empire Blue Cross Says Reserves Rose","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/nyregion/empire-blue-cross-says-reserves-rose.html","abstract":"  Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield reported yesterday that its reserves had risen to $205.6 million at the end of the first quarter of 1993 from $39.7 million at the end of 1992.

It happened in the Great Depression: there were 10 years of stagnation that ended not because of any internal dynamic but from the massive spending for the war.
