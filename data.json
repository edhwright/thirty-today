So it comes as a surprise to many people that Larry EchoHawk, a Pawnee Indian and Democrat who counts President Clinton as a friend, is holding a steady double-digit lead in the polls in the race to become Idaho's next governor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940905","headline":"Sports of The Times; Carroll Wins His First Against a Super Team","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/05/sports/sports-of-the-times-carroll-wins-his-first-against-a-super-team.html","abstract":"  PETE CARROLL doesn't remember the exact moment somebody handed him a 1994 National Football League schedule with the notation: Sept. 4, Jets at Buffalo.

That applies abroad, too: Clintonites have reversed 12 years of Reagan-Bush policies denying aid dollars to countries where abortion is included in birth control.   They promised and delivered; that's democracy. But then, in the run-up to the U.N. population conference in Cairo, advocates of abortion rights went a bridge too far.   Trickily avoiding the A-word, U.S. sherpas espoused a U.N. statement calling for governments to provide \"reproductive rights\" including 'fertility regulation\" and \"pregnancy termination\" throughout the world -- as if new verbal compounds could conceal the abortion deed.    The Vatican wasn't fooled by these euphemisms, and cunningly enlisted Muslim fundamentalists to reject imposing \"a current life style of certain opulent societies\" (that's satanic Uncle Sam) on third-world nations.   Fine; brings the battle out in the open. But then the Vatican went too far: not only did the Pope's spokesman condescendingly refer to the U.S. Government as \"this Administration,\" but he publicly attacked Vice President Al Gore by name.   The Pope's representative impugned the sincerity of Gore's conciliatory assertion that the U.S. did not seek an international right to abortion. In delivering that shot, the papal spokesman seemed to suggest that the second-highest official elected by Americans was a hypocrite.   That was a personal insult issued in the Pope's name. Unless corrected, it will stand as unprecedented papal meddling in U.S. politics.    It's overreaching enough for a U.S. bishop to predict the political behavior of co-religionists, as Bishop James McHugh did yesterday with his warning of a \"powerful incentive to American Catholics to walk away from the Democratic Party.\" For the Pope himself to permit his official spokesman to rail against any specific American political figure demeans the Vatican -- or \"this papacy,\" as spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls might put it.   Reached by phone in Cairo yesterday, Gore played it cool: \"In dealing with those who are actually negotiating at this conference,\" he soothed, \"I've found people to be constructive and conciliatory on both sides.\"   He found Bishop McHugh \"statesmanlike in saying, even though they will not accept the view that contraception is all right, nevertheless signaling they fully understand that if other organizations wish to make condoms available, they won't strenuously object.\"   Understandably, after feminists, greens and redistributionists got carried away, Gore has been shifting the focus away from abortion to contraception, and then to a wider area of agreement: education and equality for women. Let's hope he can; Perdita Huston's seminal 1979 book, \"Third World Women Speak Out,\" showed that to be a key to family stability.   My objection to the new Malthusians is their insistence that crowding is the obstacle to economic growth and individual advancement. Hong Kong and Taiwan show that to be as untrue as Thomas Malthus's predictions of world starvation two centuries ago. As nations get richer and people get educated, families get smaller.   \"Yeah, I've heard that 'Development is the best contraceptive' for 20 years,\" counters Gore. \"We're adopting a more holistic approach here in Cairo. Availability of contraception; increase of child survival to encourage smaller families; education and empowerment of women; and the economic development to make it easier to establish the others.\"   Conservatives who put individual freedom first can embrace that quartet. The danger comes from the gender-agenda coercionaries overpopulating global conferences who would make governments the levelers of nations and bureaucrats the makers of family decisions. A \"right to develop\" is not an entitlement to a handout.   The Vatican did well to blow the whistle on the power grab of the new Malthusians; the result is the creative tension of open debate. And moral instruction by preachers has a traditional place in politics. But the Pope should tell his arrogant spokesman that he harmed the anti-abortion cause by getting politically mean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940905","headline":"Yes, Cowboys Will Play For Coach Switzer, Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/05/sports/pro-football-yes-cowboys-will-play-for-coach-switzer-too.html","abstract":"  At first glance, the Dallas-Pittsburgh match up was one of running backs, of Emmitt Smith versus Barry Foster, of which team could run first and run last and eventually trample the opposing defense.

The ban covers only 19 kinds of rapid-fire weapons. There are 600 similar weapons still on the market. Also, guns have long lives. The gun linked to the slaying of an NBC stagehand in midtown Manhattan last week was a Chinese assault rifle that can no longer be imported. But this weapon, a version of the AK-47, was still around to fulfill the deadly business for which it was specifically designed.   All this means the road to firearms sanity is a long one, and the partial ban was worth passing for tactical and symbolic reasons. It was another step in getting Congress in the habit of responding to the broad public demand for gun-free streets.

The violence comes from both sides, but India's obdurate insistence on resolving a political problem by force has increasingly enmeshed it in a campaign of lawless state terrorism. The ugly results are documented in a new study by Human Rights Watch/Asia.    Regrettably, Washington, instead of raising its voice to defend human rights, has lowered it in an effort to improve commercial and diplomatic ties. The U.S. may have little power to deter India from repression. But the Clinton Administration should assert American disapproval more forthrightly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940906","headline":"Officer Is Slain By Brother, Also on Force","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/06/nyregion/officer-is-slain-by-brother-also-on-force.html","abstract":"  After an afternoon at a family barbecue spent drinking and arguing over plans for his bachelor party, a New York City police sergeant was shot and killed by his older brother, himself a police officer, in the older brother's home late Saturday night, the police said.

Dr. Golledge, a geographer at the university, was testing a prototype navigation system for the blind that announced the whereabouts of the objects through stereo headphones mounted to a computer in his backpack, creating a virtual reality landscape. The information came not from some miniature radar but from the signals broadcast by the military's network of global positioning satellites.

But many economists say that any savings would largely disappear if everybody had managed-care coverage.   In large part, these economists say, the savings of managed care -- which come from steering patients to doctors and hospitals that accept lower fees and cost-saving rules -- are illusory for the country as a whole. That is because when a managed-care group negotiates a lower group rate with a hospital, say, the hospital does not simply absorb the loss of revenue. Instead, it makes up the difference from patients with traditional fee-for-service coverage, a tactic called cost-shifting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940906","headline":"Developers Seek Profits in Polluted Land","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/06/nyregion/developers-seek-profits-in-polluted-land.html","abstract":"  If the 166-acre tract of scraggly, garbage-strewn undergrowth here seems an unlikely place for a new shopping mall, consider what lies beneath its scarred topsoil.
