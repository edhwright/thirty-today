Kennedy Center for the Peforming Arts, is a somewhat streamlined, aerated staging of that popular ballet. Mr. Tomasson uses the familiar Prokofiev score, judiciously pruning it with only one cut showing. Jens-Jacob Worsaae's sets are coolly formal with a pleasant period flavor and with Thomas R. Skelton's lighting add a welcome airiness to the ballet.    But this \"Romeo and Juliet\" is nonetheless on the dull side. Mr. Tomasson brings little that is fresh to the choreography, relying on a familiar lexicon of impassioned runs and arabesques, high skewed lifts and cross-stage draggings of the protesting heroine to tell his story in dance terms. And while he has made elements of the story much clearer, it is not until the last act that the characters break loose at all from prescribed behavior.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940525","headline":"Argument Arises Over Transfer of Land to College Trustees","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/25/nyregion/argument-arises-over-transfer-of-land-to-college-trustees.html","abstract":"  New Jersey's nine state colleges and Gov.

Using laboratory techniques that were unavailable at the time of her death in 1985, scientists have performed an autopsy on her brain and come up with a surprising finding.   The researchers said they had expected to learn that the most severe brain damage leading to Ms. Quinlan's persistent vegetative state was in the cortex, the gray outer layer where many higher brain functions take place, because autopsies on others in this state had shown extensive damage in that area. But contrary to expectations, the new autopsy found that the major damage was to the thalamus, a structure that is deep in the brain and whose role is less well defined. There was no damage to the brain stem, which controls heartbeat, breathing and other vital functions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940526","headline":"As Senators Go, So Go College Presidents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/l-as-senators-go-so-go-college-presidents-213560.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Why I Am Leaving the Senate\" (Op-Ed, May 13) by Senator David Boren, I predict:","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Why Economic Systems Need Overhaul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/l-why-economic-systems-need-overhaul-213756.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   No political-economic system or theory is applicable at all times to all situations.

But the details, and the money to actually make good on the cuts, was left to future lawmakers.   The 23-to-11 vote, following approval by the House of Representatives last week, is predicated on the belief that the huge loans taken by the state to pay off its accumulated deficit in 1991 will gradually be paid off as the decade closes out. The cuts would phase in over eight years as that debt is paid off.  Republicans Are Critical    Republican opponents in the Democratic-controlled legislature criticized the plan as insulting to voters, who will see little or no benefit this year or next, and unrealistic in any case because almost every provision will have to be passed again by future legislators under future governors.

And whereas the Snowflake scene used to begin the second act, it now concludes the first, as Tchaikovsky intended.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Black America's Silent Majority","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/black-americas-silent-majority.html","abstract":"For years now, the same regrettable scene has played itself out repeatedly all over the country: a young black man is beaten or killed by the police (usually after having committed a crime), and a large group of black people march on city hall or police headquarters, demanding justice.\n\nConsider Ernest Sayon, who died in police custody on April 29 after he had been arrested at the scene of a drug deal in a public housing project on Staten Island.

She posed some interesting challenges for herself in songs by Poulenc, Griffes and Richard Strauss that rely, to varying degrees, on currents of delicacy and nostalgia.    Had she merely scaled back her sound, she would have seemed restrained, not persuasive. Instead, she followed her instincts and shaped each song on her own terms. She found the perfect lilt for Poulenc's \"Chemins de l'Amour,\" and in Griffes's \"Three Poems by Fiona McLeod\" she suggested the hazy, impressionistic atmosphere without making any sacrifices in power. The Strauss songs were better still: her graceful changes in coloration were entirely responsive to the texts, and made for exquisite, moving accounts of \"Befreit\" and \"Morgen.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"What the Pacers Learned From Game 1","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/sports/pro-basketball-what-the-pacers-learned-from-game-1.html","abstract":"  The Pacers watched film yesterday morning, the good and the bad, of their Game 1 loss to the Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday night, and what they saw was too much ugliness in between and toward the end to topple the focused and hungry Knicks.

Dominant in this music, even in its allusions to folk dance and simple song, is a dour earnestness, one that invents and orders on a high level of originality and according to its own stern terms. Brahms has his moments of seduction, and indeed, the Hungarian flavors of the familiar A-minor Quartet are inviting. Yet asceticism and lean muscle are the real fabric of all three pieces.   In much the same way, an evening with the Juilliard Quartet is rarely a restful experience. These are intensely thoughtful musicians for whom color is a minor priority and hedonism out of the question. Long legato spans are punctuated, often interrupted, by the Juilliard's surging sense of accent. Music, its four musicians seem to be telling us, is an endless source of information for those with the determination and vitality to look for it.

Yet despite its sugarcoating, \"Bring In the Morning,\" which opened on Monday at the Variety Arts Theater, frequently crackles with life. Directed by Sheldon Epps, with music by Gary William Friedman and lyrics by Herb Schapiro, the show features an exceptional cast of young performers who portray a cross section of city youths from 16 to their early 20's.

But it does get trade talks back on track -- a welcome reversal after the breakdown in February. Talks should relieve the friction that has focused undue attention on a secondary issue -- the $50 billion bilateral trade imbalance -- that drives these allies apart rather than on Mr. Hata's stalled agenda of political and economic reforms that can pull them together.   Though Japan's overall trade surplus results from its high savings rate, the imbalance with the U.S. is in part because of barriers that shut out U.S. exports and investment. Most economists agree that the harm to the U.S. economy is small. But Japan's practices undermine confidence in trade rules and, most important for Mr. Clinton and Congress, hurt powerful constituents -- like Motorola in the cellular phone market.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"1944:U.S. Patrols Meet : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/IHT-1944us-patrols-meet-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WITH ALLIED ARMIES IN ITALY [From our New York edition:] American 5th Army patrols, advancing rapidly through the enemy-evacuated Pontine Marshes, made contact with patrols from the Anzio beachhead early this morning [May 25], climaxing a dramatic two-wee","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Riley Still Sees A Tough Series","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/sports/pro-basketball-riley-still-sees-a-tough-series.html","abstract":"  Both the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers are unbeaten at home during the playoffs.

One of New York's institutions, the Monday-night big band at the Village Vanguard gets its annual one-week show. It's a band with all sorts of arranging; its strength is its colors and its soloists. It's also, mistakenly, taken for granted. Shows today and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is no third show on Sunday. There is a $12 cover and an $8 minimum for all shows. PETER WATROUS Jacky Terrasson    Jacky Terrasson, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. The pianist Jacky Terrasson is a master of dynamics, and his trio, with Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Leon Parker on drums, is tight, concise and empathetic. The band is also dedicated to swinging, and it gets a light but furious forward motion going. Mr. Terrasson isn't afraid of strange chords and unusual juxtapositions; he traffics in surprise. Shows through tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.; there is a $15 cover and an $8 minimum. P. W. Little Jimmy Scott    Little Jimmy Scott, the Chestnut Room, Tavern on the Green, Central Park at West 67th Street, (212) 873-3200. Little Jimmy Scott's piercing wail infuses everything he sings with an aura of metaphysical lamentation. The songs are mostly ballad standards that lend themselves to a keening rhythm-and-blues style, suggesting a hybrid of Dinah Washington and Little Anthony. The program focuses on songs from Mr. Scott's forthcoming album, \"Dream\" (Warner Brothers). He is backed by a quartet led by the pianist Ken Ichi Shimazu. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and at 8:30 and 10:30 on Sunday night. There is a music charge of $23.50 tonight and tomorrow and $17.50 on Sunday. S. H. Jazz Album of the Week    Kevin Hays, \"Seventh Sense,\" (Blue Note; CD only, $10.99). For those who love the more experimental albums recorded by Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson and Andrew Hill on the Blue Note label in the 1960's, \"Seventh Sense\" is a jolt of joy. Mr. Hays, a pianist best known for his association with the tenor saxophonist Josh Redman, has assembled an excellent band (including Seamus Blake on saxophones, Steve Nelson on vibes, Doug Wiess on bass and Brian Blade on drums) that wheels its way through his open, moody compositions along with works by -- surprise -- Bobby Hutcherson and Joe Henderson. Although the recording isn't well sequenced -- three slow tunes in the middle make it a bit hard to listen to -- it captures the charge that experimentation had in the mid-1960's, when harmonic and rhythmic exploration merged with a solid grounding of swing. It helps that the rhythm section drives so hard; this is an album built on the relationship between piano and vibes and a roaring bass and drums. P.

Alas, they ran third.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Steady as the Rain, Krickstein Gets the Better of Stich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/sports/tennis-steady-as-the-rain-krickstein-gets-the-better-of-stich.html","abstract":"  Battered by the intermittent spring showers that drenched the French Open today, bolstered by the silver screws that keep the bones in both feet intact and emboldened by his unblemished record against Michael Stich, what else could Aaron Krickstein do but win his second-round match?   In fact, Krickstein positively trounced Stich today, but the 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 upset didn't seem to surprise either the subdued victor or the sullen loser. A lethargic Stich, whose recent first-round Australian and United States Open losses and second-round exit today have provided a stark counterpoint to his No. 2 ranking, committed 10 double faults and 57 unforced errors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Review/Pop; Huey Lewis and the News, Back and Forth in Time","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/arts/review-pop-huey-lewis-and-the-news-back-and-forth-in-time.html","abstract":"  Huey Lewis's big hits from the mid-1980's are now old enough to be oldies themselves. But for his new album, \"Four Chords and Several Years Ago\" (Elektra), he has backtracked even further to perform rock, soul and blues songs from the 1950's and 60's. At Tramps on Wednesday night, Huey Lewis and the News, plus a three-man horn section and two female backup singers, ran through time-honored songs like \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" interspersed with Mr. Lewis's hits from the 1980's.    The lineage was clear. Mr. Lewis's songs, which often promise a happy-ever-after love, are steeped in slow-rolling rhythm-and-blues and chugging 1950's rock-and-roll. As for the vintage songs, the band and Mr. Lewis ran through them without missing a note. But most of the time, they completely missed the point.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Review/City Ballet; Nothing More Than a Frolic? Think Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/arts/review-city-ballet-nothing-more-than-a-frolic-think-again.html","abstract":"  The New York City Ballet danced two quirky works by Jerome Robbins on Sunday night at the New York State Theater.    At first, \"Concertino\" appears to be nothing more than a frolic for three dancers to two compositions by Stravinsky: the Concertino for 12 Instruments and Three Pieces for Clarinet Solo. Like many comparable balletic entertainments, it begins with a scene for everyone in the cast. But contrary to tradition, there is no grand finale. Instead, \"Concertino\" ends with three solos. This makes the ballet trail off in a slightly anticlimactic manner. But Mr. Robbins appears to enjoy breaking with convention and responding to Stravinsky in any unusual way he wishes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Shortchanging Rights in China","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/opinion/shortchanging-rights-in-china.html","abstract":"  Succumbing to enormous pressure from business interests, President Clinton has walked away from his own sensible policy of linking Beijing's trade privileges to modest human rights progress.

As she lay dying neighbors asked me to defend the tumult caused by a dozen television minivans, several large satellite uplink trucks and bright lights playing on the building's Fifth Avenue facade.   The television journalists who had to do the difficult job also felt the loss. They were orderly and respectful. They hoped their lights would not disturb Mrs. Onassis or her family.   Yet it should have been possible to reduce redundant equipment. Pool cameras could have provided adequate coverage at the front of the building.

Smith would immerse himself in his stories, sometimes spending months working on one; his essays, combining equal measures of reportage and sentiment, were hailed as classics of the medium.    Since Smith's death in 1978, at the age of 59, his reputation as a photographer has been somewhat eclipsed by stories of his troubled personal life, which was punctuated by battles with editors and struggles with alcohol and amphetamines.

Sitting on an outsized rocker and wearing children's duds, Edith Ann observed the passing world with that special combination of innocence and mischief reserved for childhood. Her idealism was exceeded only by her determination, signaled by a very visible tongue poking through the corner of clenched lips as she made gloriously opinionated entries in her diary.   Ms. Tomlin went on, of course, to assorted personal triumphs in television, film and the theater, although in recent years her appearances have been far too few to satisfy more ardent fans. Now, coming full circle, she has returned to television and Edith Ann in a series of animated half-hour specials constructed around the little girl and her stress-laden but loving family. Jane Wagner, Ms. Tomlin's longtime collaborator, is the writer. The animation is by Klasky Csupo, best known for the original version of \"The Simpsons.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Police Say Rape of 6-Year-Old Fits Pattern of Other Assaults","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/nyregion/police-say-rape-of-6-year-old-fits-pattern-of-other-assaults.html","abstract":"  A 6-year-old girl was raped on Monday on the roof of a Chinatown apartment building, the police said, and investigators believe the same man has accosted at least four other girls in the area in the last year.
