The main event will be a book-signing by Ron Cohen, who wrote and illustrated the recently published children's book \"My Dad's Baseball\" (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard). The dreamy story is set in 1955, when Mr. Cohen went to his first game, at Yankee Stadium, and the ball landed near his seat. - The show, which includes the original pastels of the book's illustrations and Mr. Cohen's larger baseball paintings of Mickey Mantle, Roy Campanella and Babe Ruth, reveals Mr. Cohen's working process: the text is in sequence on one wall, while on another are drafts and final versions of the drawings.   Children can also see baseball gloves and mitts handmade by the Sports Doctor, who is actually John Golomb, based in Rocky Hill, N.J. Baseball memorabilia is on loan from Scrivener's Collectibles in Maplewood.   Mr. Cohen will sign his books, priced at $15, tomorrow from 1 to 3 P.M. His pastels sell for $625 and his paintings for $3,000. The Sports Doctor's ready-made and handmade gloves and mitts are $95 to $350. The memorabilia are for sale, from $20 to $5,000.

Unless they choose a field of study in high demand, graduate school is not a simple solution.   Indeed, a graduate degree can lessen the chance of finding a job if one does not have substantial experience beforehand. The experience trap is such that most positions that require a master's degree also require two years of experience. Entry-level positions that would enable one to gain experience require only a bachelor's degree. Thus companies are reluctant to consider applicants with advanced degrees because they are perceived as overqualified.   Times of structural shifts in the economy highlight the deficiency of a market economy in matching employees with employers. From an economic standpoint, unemployment and underemployment reduce the productive potential of the economy. From a human perspective, a spiral of rejection can lead to destruction of self-esteem.    Young people leave college with self-confidence, believing they can help change the world. At the end of the humiliating job search they wonder if they can change a light bulb.   Other than through contacts and unethical insider information, the prime way people look for jobs is through newspaper want ads. Many newspapers have yet to enter the computer age, except for a few like your Fast Track service. It is time consuming for applicants to sift through the want ads and for businesses to go through hundreds of resumes. Computerized searches using new software would greatly increase the efficiency of matching applicants with employers.   Therefore, Congress ought to speed approval of the computerized national jobs bank contained in the Clinton Administration's job retraining plan. Putting jobs on line maximizes both economic efficiency and social justice, which cannot be said of too many things.

Tashkin advocates medicinal use of dronabinol, a synthetic cannabinoid in capsule form, instead of smoked cannabis. Most patients who have compared smoked cannabis with dronabinol say that smoking is always more effective. Variations in the absorption of oral cannabis from the digestive tract make it difficult to control the dose. Also, people who suffer from nausea and vomiting find it difficult to take cannabis orally.   Dr. Tashkin reviews some concerns about the long-term effects of cannabis smoking on the lungs. After studying cannabis more than 25 years, I have come to believe, largely due to Dr. Tashkin's work, that pulmonary effects are the only well-documented harm from long-term cannabis use. I believe his letter exaggerates this, but it has little to do with use of cannabis as a medicine.   I would share Dr. Tashkin's concern if medical cannabis users had to smoke many cigarettes a day. But most people who use cannabis as a medicine (for multiple sclerosis, AIDS weight loss syndrome, migraine headaches, epilepsy, menstrual tension, nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy) need a few puffs to relieve symptoms.    Patients who use some of the newer, more potent strains of marijuana need to inhale even less noxious smoke. Dr. David B. Busch of the Department of Environmental and Toxicologic Pathology has demonstrated, examining lung cells, that sinsemilla, a potent form, has fewer of the pulmonary effects Dr. Tashkin describes than standard varieties.    Water pipes can also filter carcinogen substances in marijuana, a practice the Government unfortunately discourages. When marijuana becomes available as a medicine, we should see even more efficient ways to separate noxious from useful constituents of the smoke.   Dr. Tashkin's cautions should be taken seriously in some contexts, but they have little relevance to the use of smoked cannabis as a medicine.

In the last few years, the time lag of nostalgia has caught up with the 1970's, and what seemed a decade ago to be the most embarrassing pop era has been embraced anew, with and without campy irony. At the time, disco's worship of artifice, its unsubtle beat and its superficial lyrics earned the scorn of many rock fans. Yet disco's uncomplicated, pre-AIDS hedonism now strikes some listeners as an Edenic state, before the advent of even more mechanical dance music and even less convincing party anthems. Disco wasn't entirely without variety; the beat carried touches of big bands, doo-wop vocal harmonies, gospel and torch singing.

Enter, Outrage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/arts/modify-beckett-enter-outrage.html","abstract":"  Samuel Beckett's \"Footfalls,\" a 20-minute monodrama that was originally staged in 1976, has become the center of a theatrical tempest. Trustees of the playwright's estate were so enraged by Deborah Warner's revival here that they canceled the rights for a European tour. English critics were diametrically opposed in their assessments, while audiences filled the Garrick Theater. In an unusual venture, the play, starring Fiona Shaw, was performed twice every evening, with theatergoers paying $:4 (about $6) for unreserved seats.   The play closed over the weekend after its one-week run, but the controversy won't subside, with Beckett partisans demanding fidelity to his text and others insisting on greater theatrical license for directorial interpretation. Clearly, the event will have repercussions on how Beckett's plays, and plays by other recently deceased authors, will be done or not done in the future. Although there have been a number of conflicts over productions of Beckett, this is the first significant clash since the playwright's death in 1989. Modernist Collaborators    The production of \"Footfalls\" was the latest in a series of collaborations between Ms. Warner and Ms. Shaw. Having previously worked together on \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"Electra,\" they brought their modernist sensibilities to bear on this pivotal experimental work. Their own stature in the English theater almost guaranteed a successful run.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940326","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/arts/classical-music-in-review-587630.html","abstract":"  Festival of 20th-Century Music  Manhattan School of Music","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940326","headline":"Utility Shares: A Qualified 'Buy'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/your-money/IHT-utility-shares-a-qualified-buy.html","abstract":"ANY movement in interest rates, like this week's inching higher of short- term rates in the United States, places investor focus on the types of equities that are most sensitive to such movements.

Oswald (Nick Borjlind) is an 11-year-old who looks like a somber version of Macaulay Culkin. In 1959, he and his parents spend the summer with relatives in the country. His father, Tjaffo (Rolf Lassgard), is tall and heavyset but his greatness is all in Oswald's mind.   Tjaffo is a hapless drinker and womanizer, the kind who glides through life on charm. Among his most endearing actions, he organizes a local church choir and teaches them Argentine hymns. Oswald's mother (Ann Petren) is patient, understanding and totally without illusions about her husband. The most intriguing aspect of the film is Oswald's understandable hero worship of his father, an identification so thorough that the boy sometimes treats his mother with cruel neglect.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940326","headline":"Election Aide May Succeed Slain Mexican","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/world/election-aide-may-succeed-slain-mexican.html","abstract":"  With their long-ruling party still anguishing over the murder of its presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, Government officials said today that the American-trained economist who ran Mr. Colosio's campaign had emerged as the favorite to succeed him.

It's an impulse as old as the quills, older in fact. In antiquity, young Roman noblemen, touring Greece as part of their higher education, delighted in visiting literary and mythological sites -- the marketplace where Socrates taught, the cliff from which lovesick Sappho leaped to her death, the plain where Troy burned, causing the Trojan hero Aeneas to flee to Italy, where he sired a line that descended to their own emperor Augustus. This last was a piece of mythology that the poet Virgil had made into a kind of holy book to justify Rome's place in history, and his \"Aeneid\" sent hundreds of togaed visitors to Troy, where it all began.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/travel/q-and-a-538752.html","abstract":"  By Freighter Down Under    Q. Can you give me any detailed information about getting to Australia and New Zealand by freighter? -- Stanley Hamer, Sebring, Fla.   A. There are two freighter lines with passenger cabins that make the trip to Australia from the United States, and both can be boarded in Florida.   Columbus Line operates four ships from the East Coast, three with three double cabins and six singles and one with four doubles. The ships are the Columbus America, the Columbus Australia, the Columbus New Zealand and the Columbus Queensland. On the West Coast the Columbus Victoria, with four double cabins, leaves from Los Angeles. All accommodations are in outside cabins with private bathrooms.   The vessels are registered in Germany and have German officers.   The East Coast voyages begin in Jacksonville, Fla., continue to Houston, and then transit the Panama Canal to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in Australia and Wellington, Auckland and Port Chalmers, New Zealand. On the return trip the vessels end the voyage in Philadelphia, sometimes calling at Kingston, Jamaica, on the way.   The round-trip voyages from the East Coast take 68 days; one-way voyages last about a month. Jacksonville departures are made about once a month; from Los Angeles ships leave every 50 days.   Round-trip fares from Jacksonville are $5,450 a person, with two people to a cabin, and $6,070 a person for a single cabin. One-way fares from Jacksonville to Australia are $2,725 a person (two to a cabin) and $3,035 for a single. One-way fares to New Zealand are $3,270 and $3,645 a person.   More information can be obtained from Freighter World Cruises, 180 South Lake Avenue, Pasadena, Calif. 91101; telephone (818) 449-3106. The company acts as exclusive passenger agent in North America for 14 lines and publishes a twice-a-month update of what ships are going where and what the trip will cost. A subscription to the publication, called Freighter Space Advisory, is $33 a year.   The other freighter company with passenger space that makes the run to Australia and New Zealand, the Blue Star line, operates four ships on the East Coast and they, too, leave from Jacksonville. The ships are the America Star, the Melbourne Star, the Sydney Star and the Queensland Star. Its two ships on the West Coast, the Columbia Star and the California Star, leave from Los Angeles. All the ships are registered in the Bahamas.    The East Coast ships transit the Panama Canal and cross the Pacific Ocean to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, continuing to Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, returning to Philadelphia. The West Coast ships cross to Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington and Auckland, coming back through Suva, Fiji, and ending the voyage in Seattle.    The round-trip fare from Jacksonville is from $5,400 to $7,700 a person for two people sharing a cabin, depending on the time of year, with summer sailings at the lower end of the range. The round-trip voyage from Los Angeles, which takes 42 days, is $4,400 a person for two people sharing a cabin or $5,300 a person for a single cabin. The round trip from Jacksonville takes from 65 to 70 days. There are about 20 sailings a year from Jacksonville and 17 a year from Los Angeles.    The Blue Star line, which is represented by the Travltips Cruise and Freighter Association, recently introduced a fly-sail program.    Passengers can fly from Los Angeles to Australia or New Zealand and come back to the West Coast by ship, for a total of 22 days at sea. Fares are about $2,900 a person for two people sharing a cabin or $3,308 for a single cabin. The air fare to Los Angeles would be an additional expense for East Coast passengers.    Passengers can also sail from Jacksonville to Australia and fly back to the West Coast. Fares start at $3,600 a person for two people sharing a cabin. On that trip you would be sea for about 30 days.    Travltips, 163-07 Depot Road, Post Office Box 188, Flushing, N.Y. 11358, (800) 872-8584, puts out a 32-page magazine every other month on news of ships and accounts of trips by association members. The magazine, Travltips, is available for $15 a year. Polish Trains   Q. I will be traveling to Poland soon. Can you give me some information about the availability of trains between Warsaw and Cracow and the approximate travel time? -- J. James, Smithtown, L.I.   A. The two cities are very well served by rail, with a minimum of five express trains every day from Warsaw to Cracow.   In addition, at least three Inter-City trains make the trip from the capital to Cracow every day, with additional Inter-City service once a day from Monday to Saturday, once a day from Monday to Friday and once a day from Sunday to Friday.   On the return trip to Warsaw there are five express trains every day, with an additional daily express from Monday to Saturday, plus four Inter-City trains a day.    The journey by express and Inter-City to Cracow takes 2 hours 40 minutes. One-way tickets for express trains with seat reservations are $13 in first class and $9 in second. One-way tickets for Inter-City trains with seat reservations are $14 in first class and $10 in second. The Inter-City trains, which are part of the European Inter-City network, are newer than the expresses and in first class the price of the ticket includes a small sandwich, fruit and tea, coffee or a soft drink.    Express trains leave Warsaw every day at 6:55 A.M., 9 A.M., 12:55 P.M., 3:55 P.M. and 6:55 P.M. From Sunday to Friday an express leaves at 4:55 P.M.    The Inter-City leaves Warsaw every day at 10:55 A.M., 2:55 P.M. and at 5:55 P.M. An Inter-City also leaves at 7:55 A.M. from Monday to Saturday, at 9:55 A.M. from Monday to Friday, and at 1:55 P.M. from Sunday to Friday.   Expresses, which take 2 hours, 35 minutes for the trip from Cracow, leave daily at 6:10 A.M., 7:10 A.M., 10:10 A.M., 4:10 P.M. and 7:10 P.M. From Monday to Saturday an express also leaves at 8:10 A.M.    The Inter-City trains, which also take 2 hours, 35 minutes to reach Warsaw, leave Cracow every day at 1:10 P.M., 3:10 P.M. and at 6:10 P.M. An Inter-City train also leaves from Monday to Saturday at 9:10 A.M.; from Monday to Friday at 11:10 A.M. and 5:10 P.M. On Sunday an additional Inter-City leaves at 8:10 P.M.  Budapest and Vienna   Q. I will be in Budapest from April 22 for a week and will then go to Vienna for a week. What sort of temperatures can I expect? -- Betty Wilson, Scarsdale, N.Y.   A. Weather conditions in both cities will be strikingly similar, with a slight edge in temperature to Budapest.   Average highs in Budapest in April are 62 degrees and average lows 44. The comparable figures for Vienna are 58 and 42.   The average monthly precipitation is both cities in April is identical at 1.8 inches.

That is when Jim Calhoun, the coach of the Connecticut Huskies, spat out the declaration -- \"This will never happen again\" -- that established the workmanlike approach that helped create a memorable season.   It was not a championship season, because the disappearance of a 10-point lead in the second half became a 69-60 overtime loss to Florida and an abrupt end to a 29-5 season. The first-place finish in the revived Big East -- by a conference-record three-game margin -- is not regarded as a championship. The team that came within one step of matching the longest trip any of Connecticut's 17 N.C.A.A. teams have taken in the tournament became another casualty in an East Regional of surprising results.

The psychiatric literature is filled with commentary about the anguish of depressed patients struggling over the decision whether to live or die, and the tranquillity often seen in patients once they have decided to commit suicide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"Gimbels Condominium Developers Hope to Regain an Investment's Luster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/nyregion/gimbels-condominium-developers-hope-to-regain-an-investments-luster.html","abstract":"It was an audacious plan, fueled by the real-estate boom of the 1980's: take a failed department store a block from Park Avenue, strip it down to its steel framework and transform it into luxury apartments.

I heard in that class that many in Europe had believed that Jews had been taught by the Talmud to poison the wells and that the Black Death had been brought by \"Talmud Jews.\" I learned that in the Middle Ages, it was firmly believed that the Talmud instructed Jews to use the blood of Christians in the ritual of making matzoh, the unleavened Passover bread, and so the manuscripts of the Talmud were often burned by princes on advice of the church. In the required course in literature, we were studying \"The Merchant of Venice.\" The \"enlightened\" teacher made a point of telling us that Shylock's crassness and anger were not an innate characteristic of Jews; it was the unfortunate cast that centuries of obedience to the Talmud had given their character. \n\nEarly in the morning before going to school I studied the Talmud with my father; he was waiting for me when I came home so that we could return to the text. I had no doubt that what I was hearing at school was wrong and hurtful. My problem was: Why had \"they\" been saying such things for so long? The easiest answer was theological bias, deeply ingrained in Western culture. The metaphor the first Talmudists used to explain themselves to themselves -- that the Talmud, the authoritative library of Jewish law, ethics, mysticism and folklore, is an ocean and that those who study it are swimmers who fight great waves to find truth -- has persisted among the students of rabbinic texts for more than 20 centuries. But for the early Christians, the chronicles of the discussions and debates of the rabbis in the great academies of Jewish learning for the seven centuries ending with A.D. 500, which constitute the Talmud, were a Dead Sea, and the Pharisees, who founded those great academies, a sect that preferred the letter of the law to its spirit. Western Christian culture had been embroidering this charge for centuries. In the 1700's and 1800's, many of those willing and even eager to give Jews equal rights made it clear that emancipation would come only if the Jews would free themselves from the separatist rituals and nonsensical tales and doctrines that were recorded in the Talmud. (This enlightened idea even appeared among Jews. Most socialists, many Zionists and almost all Reform Jews believed, only a generation ago, that the Jewish spirit was hobbled by the legalisms of the Talmud.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"The Seven-Month Effort to Rescue NY 1078-93 Is Nearing a Nervous Ending","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/nyregion/about-long-island-seven-month-effort-rescue-ny-1078-93-nearing-nervous-ending.html","abstract":"  YOU wonder if she knows, this whale that swims round and round a tank in the aquarium at Coney Island.

(Of course then as now, necessity drove more women to work than mere opportunity did.) Women won the right to vote in Germany in 1918 and in America two years later.    They also established a sizable presence in the arts. By 1935 an American survey found that about 41 per cent of artists receiving Government assistance were women; presumably that means a pretty fair number were doing all right before the Depression hit. Photography was held up to women as a field where they could make their mark, both as business people and as artists. An ad for a women's magazine in the late 20's asked, \"What has become of the useful maiden aunt?\" and answered, \"She isn't darning anybody's stockings, not even her own.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide.   In an effort to increase the chances of restoring democracy and forcing Haiti's military leaders to step down, Administration officials say the United States plans steps that include tightening the trade embargo on Haiti and jettisoning a United States-backed plan that Father Aristide had rejected because it called on him to make concessions without providing assurances that Haiti's military would cede power.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"An American Original","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/books/in-short-nonfiction-an-american-original.html","abstract":"  If anyone deserved the title American Original, it was Isadora Duncan (1877-1927). She was the preternatural free spirit, the one who dreamed up modern dance as a thing of powerful simplicity and economic means aligned with great music, the one who beat a barefoot path for the likes of Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham to follow. Live free, dance free, be free was her guiding principle. Although many luminaries of her day have described the power of Duncan's dancing, no shred of film footage exists; she steadfastly avoided the movie camera, believing that the absence of an audience would alter her art. The remarkable drawings and photographs in LIFE INTO ART: Isadora Duncan and Her World (Norton, $40) give a vivid sense of Duncan; for example, Abraham Walkowitz's spare, brilliant watercolors and line drawings depict her on stage with her marvelously long curving neck stretched heavenward and her feet kissing the ground. The text -- by Duncan's grandniece, Doree Duncan; Carol Pratl, a dancer and teacher; and Cynthia Splatt, the author of \"Isadora Duncan and Gordon Craig\" -- is, while graceful, a hit-and-run affair that gives minutiae nearly equal rank with major events and screens out such material as Duncan's besotted, suicidal states of mourning. For the grainy details of truth that bring a reader close to this mesmerizing figure, there's still no book to compare to Francis Steegmuller's \"Your Isadora.\" There one finds Gordon Craig, the actor and theatrical producer, commenting to Duncan on a photo of her and their daughter, Deirdre -- on how it misses perfection because mother is not looking down at daughter, but straight ahead at the camera. The same photo in \"Life Into Art\" sheds no such specific light.

It's a sentiment particularly appropriate to Connecticut in 1994, the year of the relentless winter. And there will be a profusion of song, both solemn and joyous, to be heard around the state throughout Holy Week.   Some of it will be presented outdoors, if it doesn't snow. In Wethersfield, at the First Church of Christ, a sunrise service is to be held in the cemetery behind the church on Easter morning, with music by a brass ensemble of young parishioners.  (Caution: Daylight Saving Time goes into effect that day, and dawn will be at 6:34 A.M.)   The South Britain Congregational Church has engaged the Royal Brass Quartet to play a half-hour concert on the green in front of the church at 10 A.M. Easter Sunday, and the First Congregational Church in Old Greenwich will offer a 15-minute outdoor performance preceding each of its services today through next Sunday.   Indoors, at the Church of the Redeemer in New Haven, a \"Messiah\" sing-in will be held on Friday at 8 P.M., reviving a tradition that was popular in the 1980's.    And in Woodbridge, a new music-drama will be given its first performance this evening at 7 P.M. at Trinity Evangelical Free Church. \"The Victor,\" by David T. Clydesdale, Tim Shepherd, David Mullin and Jim Owens, tells the story of Jesus's death and burial through the eyes of Benjamin, a mythical Jewish religious leader of the period.

It was pure slacker attitude; no one was going to mock his song before he did.    Beck wore 1970's detritus: a Pinto cap, a Farrah Fawcett T-shirt. But his music is fascinated with the 1960's. While everyone knows the decade is over, Beck wants to rub it in. Harking back to Bob Dylan, he started his set with a rewritten Woody Guthrie song. Songs on his debut album, \"Mellow Gold\" (Geffen 24634; CD and cassette), echo the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Neil Young and lesser 60's figures. Beck's borrowings aren't sacred relics as they are for 60's idolaters like Lenny Kravitz; they're only junk he found on the cultural sidelines.

But surprise: Against all theatrical logic (if there is such a thing), the performance, two summers ago, turned out to be very good on almost every level. Indeed, the project seemed an unqualified success, at least in the first two acts, and those of us in Europe who staggered out of bed at 6 A.M. for the third act were too busy reveling in our virtuous fortitude to quibble.   Now, with the performance released on video (Teldec 4509-90212; VHS cassette and laser disk), we can check the accuracy of our recollections. The video presentation faithfully matches the live telecast, the liner notes report, except that two gaffes -- a nasty fall by Placido Domingo in the first act and a momentary sighting of a camera in the second -- have been papered over with footage from one of the two dress rehearsals.

The art historians responsible for the exhibition (at the Tate only, through May 8), Elizabeth Cowling and John Golding, have chosen and installed 168 works in terms not of rivalry between painting and sculpture but of a dialogue between stupendous equals.

As organized and introduced by Kathleen Monaghan, the former branch director, and installed by her successor, Eugenia Tsai, the display is undeniably a tribute. But the effect is not reverential -- despite the prominence accorded O'Keeffe's magnificent image of a black cross against a blood red sky.

But many frugal New Jersey diners are setting aside such qualms about meals in culinary school restaurants and are finding savory deals indeed.\n\nAt Careme's, the airy, student-run restaurant at Atlantic Community College in Mays Landing, lunch and dinner are offered on weekdays during the school year from September through mid-May. \n\nOn a more modest scale, the Bergen Room in Paramus is the informal eating place operated by the hotel and restaurant management students at Bergen Community College. Bargain lunches are served there Tuesday through Thursday and dinner on Thursday.\n\nDonald Del Nero, the manager of the Bergen Room, said: \"It's kind of a sleeper. Not many people know about it, yet we get booked up by regulars right away.\"\n\nIn Careme's coolly modern dining room with widely spaced tables, students in the two-year program of Atlantic Community College's Academy of Culinary Arts cook the meals and serve the tables, all under faculty supervision. Many of these future chefs and managers will go on to work not far away in the Atlantic City casino restaurants.\n\nThe young serving staff in white shirts, bow ties and long aprons is trained in formal tableside preparation, and dishes like Caesar salad and orange-scented crepes suzette are usually good bets. Some of the extras, however, like chilled forks for the salad and iced spoons for the sherbet intermezzo are unnecessary gimmicks.\n\nAs you would expect, not every dish is textbook perfect, but the pleasant young staff tries hard, and satisfying choices can be found. Dinner is a la carte, with entrees between $13 and $15. The French-accented menu changes once a week, and a four-course dinner averages $20. Entrees offered recently included walnut chicken, duckling with ginger and cassis, and veal medallions with mushrooms in a flour-thickened brown sauce. The pace is leisurely, and the table is yours for the evening.\n\nSuzanne Faye, whose title is dining room educator, said: \"Part of the students' curriculum is to learn the front of the house as well as the back of the house. This restaurant is really a classroom, and they spend 15 days out here, and then they cook for 15 days.\" \n\nAt lunch, a buffet is offered for $11.95. The dishes change daily, but always include a soup of the day, an assortment of cold pates, fruits, cheeses and Mediterranean-style salads, plus five entrees. For dessert, there's a display of pastries.\n\nThe restaurant is part of the academy's $4.6 million complex, which was completed in 1991 and includes kitchens, classrooms and even a greenhouse on campus where herbs are grown.\n\nReservations are necessary. For lunch, the hours for seating are 11:30 A.M. to noon; for dinner, 6 to 7:30 P.M. This year graduation is on May 13, when the restaurant will close for the summer. There is no liquor license, and no smoking is allowed.\n\nCareme's, Atlantic Community College, 5100 Black Horse Pike (Route 322), Mays Landing. (609) 625-1111.\n\n\nAt Bergen Community College, a corner of the faculty dining room has been set apart with accordion dividers and called the Bergen Room. This somewhat makeshift spot runs on a limited schedule, serving lunch three days a week and dinner one night a week.\n\nProf. Daniel Chadwick said the meals were popular with the college's faculty and students as well as some local residents. \"We've got waiting lists for dinner,\" he said, ading that the menu is priced to cover food costs, not labor or overhead expenses.  With three-course meals averaging $8 at both lunch and dinner, he said, \"if we don't always do the best job, at least it doesn't upset the customer much.\" \n\nThe 13 students in a typical class rotate in the 13 positions, from dishwasher to controller. The school's program is geared toward the management and supervisory ends of the hotel and restaurant business rather than the culinary, said Mr. Del Nero, the Bergen Room manager.\n\nNevertheless, some of the dishes sampled on a lunchtime visit were more than acceptable. Fried calamari with spicy tomato sauce and a pleasantly filling soup of creamed corn and chicken were the starters, followed by a chef's salad (though with bottled-tasting dressing) so large it would have been ample for lunch, not just a salad course.\n\nThe main course was a gingery chicken breast accompanied by soft stir-fried vegetables and fried rice. For dessert, there was a choice of an ice cream parfait or a tasty maple syrup-flavored mousse. \n\nReservations are necessary and are accepted from Tuesday through Thursday between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. The restaurant hours for lunch are noon to 1 P.M. Tuesday through Thursday; for dinner, 7 P.M. Thursday. The semester ends on May 12.\n\nThe Bergen Room, Bergen Community College, 400 Paramus Road, Paramus.

Historians have dealt harshly with the period following the revolutions that swept through the cities of Europe in 1848. Repressive, reactionary, stuffed with overblown eclectic buildings, the third quarter of the 19th century was dominated by bad faith and bad taste. Yet this was also the era that gave us the cosmopolis, the dazzling hub of industrial and imperial prosperity, a place designed to be not only a home to its citizens but also a host to the rest of the world.   The year 1848 is remembered more for barricades than for buildings; in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Spain, workers and students took to the streets to fight for a litany of socialist demands. The year is also remembered as a time of disillusionment, a season when European artists and intellectuals lost their faith in social progress. Many artists adopted the oppositional stance that persists, in somewhat fossilized form, to this day. But something more profound than utopian hope perished in the uprisings of 1848. Neither wholly of the middle class nor fully estranged from it, many artists lost a clear sense of which side of the barricades they were on. That perplexity, the gnawing sense of doubt and displacement underlying the epoch's showy display of confidence, is what is most compelling about architecture and urbanism in the years after 1848.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"The Secret of Angels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/arts/theater-the-secret-of-angels.html","abstract":"  In \"Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,\" Tony Kushner's two-part drama on Broadway, there are verbal and visual references to all sorts of things, including pop and gay culture, Judaism, Mormonism, American history and New York City landmarks.
