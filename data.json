The Good Weather Insurance Agency in Salem, Mass., handled two of the three Connecticut contracts for Reliance National Insurance. Each policy is different, but they all require at least two or three storms before they kick in. East Hartford needs three storms with at least three inches of snow.

The city early on adopted jazz as a spiritual cause, and it was manifested in French films -- the soundtrack for Louis Malle's \"Ascenseur Pour l'Echafaud,\" with its chillingly moody music by Miles Davis, or Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless,\" with music by Martial Solal. Though American jazz musicians moved to Paris early on, and were performing there by 1919, it was after World War II that jazz blended with existentialism and was imported to the United States through film with a European beat sophistication.   But the bohemian vision created by the movies isn't quite right any more, as jazz has blended as easily with bourgeois society as it did with beat culture. In Paris, jazz is all over the city, and its audience isn't enveloped in a romantic Gauloise haze. Parisians still get nostalgic about the golden age, but their city today has an astounding variety and richness to its music. Jazz has become part of the city's consciousness in a way that challenges even New York. People go out, and they go out to relax, and listen. If you want to hear music on Saturday night (weeknights are less crowded), better reserve early.

To Jan. 29. 463-5672. \n\nAs more recognition is given to the spiritual content in midcentury American abstraction, Mark Tobey's substantial reputation becomes even more significant. This small exhibition of 15 prints from the Hofstra Museum collection, all executed in the two years before the artist's death in 1976 at age 86, is valuable as a review of Tobey's achievements and as a demonstration of the range of motifs he explored with the calligraphy-inspired thin marks that are usually termed his \"white writing.\" Frequently reproduced examples from museum collections tend to narrow public conceptions of his imagery, which is unfortunate. This show and a recent exhibition at the Yoshii Gallery in Manhattan suggest the wide scope of his themes and pictorial ideas.\n\nTobey's luminous marks sometimes rush over the entire surface and sometimes are made to seem compressed. Space can be intentionally ambiguous when it is perceived under layers of tangled lines, or it can add pressure when it surrounds a weblike mass.

In \"Patterns and Poetry: No Robes From the Lucy Truman Aldrich Collection\" (through next Sunday), Susan Hay, curator of costume and textiles, sought to make a virtue of limited gallery space by using a compact design that would show the costumes in a dramatic context. Though the original proposals called for concrete structures, David Harvey, the exhibition designer, credits budgetary constraints with forcing an appropriate solution -- the illusion of an architectural setting, in this case a 16th-century No stage at the Nishi Honganji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. In so doing he followed the Japanese principle that finds beauty in the absence or elimination of everything unnecessary. Unlike the designs of museum mega-shows that depend on quantity and showmanship, Mr. Harvey's suggestion of architecture enhances an exhibition devoted to a theater of allusion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/nyregion/c-corrections-933195.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a picture caption on page 1 of the Arts and Leisure section today about UPN, a new television network that will begin broadcasting tomorrow night, renders the full name incorrectly.

No master of the written word, Mr. Schulke is instead an insightful photographer whose shots transcend his sometimes sentimental and awkward prose. Mr. Schulke, a veteran photojournalist, makes the atmosphere -- the despair and the exhilaration -- palpable in his images, which begin with King's funeral in 1968, then backtrack to the 1963 funeral of Medgar Evers, whose death, Mr. Schulke writes, was \"the first murder of a black civil rights leader the media had paid any attention to.\" The iconography of the civil rights movement is hauntingly familiar: beefy, helmeted police officers and sheriffs' deputies, nightsticks at the ready, lips tight and implacable; demonstrators, black and white, seemingly fixed in time and place by their dedication to the cause of equal rights. Mr. Schulke frequently compromised his credentials as an impartial observer; even King once rebuked him with the warning, \"You have to stay back and not listen to your guts.\" His dislike of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace became so intense, Mr. Schulke writes, that he felt compelled to turn down magazine assignments about him. His pictures of Federal marshals, armed segregationists and protesters illustrate his recollections of tear gas, Molotov cocktails and sniper bullets. This is the third book Mr. Schulke has produced about King, with whom his relationship sounds intimate and genuine. \"He'd give you a hug,\" Mr. Schulke writes, \"and you would die for the man.\" LYNN KARPEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"What's Up -- and What's Going Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/realestate/what-s-up-and-what-s-going-up.html","abstract":"  A YEAR ago, Costas Kondylis, one of the city's most employed, most pragmatic apartment tower architects, had 13 people working for him.

It was surely not lost on him that in his first inning he was taking on competition of legendary stature, George Szell's Beethoven recordings with the same orchestra, of 30 years before.   As it turned out, Mr. Dohnanyi and his players produced an exemplary recorded cycle. His tempos and dynamics were more fluid than Szell's, and the orchestra's sound was sometimes better focused and more thrilling.

Johann Heinrich Fuseli's \"Satan Starting from the Touch of Ithuriel's Lance,\" sold to another anonymous buyer for $761,500 (the estimate was $500,000 to $700,000). And a Roman marble torso of the Diadumenos of Polykleitos, estimated to fetch $300,000 to $500,000, sold to an unidentified collector for $310,500. (Final prices include the auction house's commission, which is 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest.

The stars were a pair of well-established dancers, the regal El Camborio and his fiery partner, Lucia Real. They clattered across the floor loudly and rhythmically, their hips and torsos swaying and shaking in creative combinations of classic flamenco moves. Like all outstanding flamenco artists, they kept their arms, hands and fingers in ceaseless, evocative motion. This aspect of flamenco is perhaps the most direct evidence of its roots in southern Asia, the original home of the Gypsies who developed it.    Modeled after the 16th-century popular theaters known as corrales de comedias, Corral de la Moreria is musty with tradition. A full menu is available, but most patrons around me made do with glasses of red wine, counting on the show to provide the evening's sensory delights. They were not disappointed. The dancers overflowed with emotion, and they were expertly accompanied by stylized guitar music and jaleo, the clapping and calling that is integral to the performance. The jaleadores achieved a perfect balance between spontaneity and restraint, keeping rhythm while adding a rustic element that recalls flamenco's rural origins. Theirs is a practiced art, and a patron would no more join in the clapping than he would bring a toy banjo and strum along with the guitarists.   Flashy and colorful, wild but also highly ritualized, flamenco dancing has become an instantly recognized symbol of Spanish culture. Its rich history reflects that of Andalusia, the sunny and fertile region of southern Spain where it was born. It shows influences from the Islamic and Jewish cultures that once flourished in the region, and even from Roman dances, which arrived 20 centuries ago. But it was the Gypsies who were to flamenco \"like rice to paella,\" in the words of the historian Fernando Quinones, \"the unifying and fundamental element.\"    Flamenco has become an international art form, with schools all over the world, including several hundred in Japan. Less overtly erotic than other Latin forms, like the tango and the samba, still it is nothing if not sensual. According to Andalusian tradition, the best dancers are not young or conventionally attractive, but mature and heavy-set, their legs thick and muscular from years of practice.   Foreign interest in flamenco began as part of the wave of fascination with Spain kindled by the Romantic movement, and attracted artists ranging from Gustave Dore to Rimsky-Korsakov to Washington Irving. They and other early tourists in Spain often sought to visit academies where flamenco was taught, and in response to their interest, \"cafes cantantes\" opened in many Andalusian towns. It was their successors that I wanted to find.   My appetite whetted in Madrid, with three companions I set out for Seville, home port of conquistadors and Andalusia's largest and most important city. We traveled aboard the high-speed train that was built to serve visitors to the 1992 world exposition there. The trip, which only four years ago lasted the better part of a day, now takes just two and a half hours. The ride was smooth and the airline-style service courteously efficient as we sped southward.   Romances between dancers and bullfighters are the stuff of countless legends and stories still told in Andalusia, so it was fitting that both of the flamenco bars we visited in Seville were in the shadow of the famous Maestranza bullring. The shows reflected very different aspects of flamenco's modern face.   El Patio Sevillano is a large room decorated in Andalusian patio style, with ceramic tiles and engravings of the city. Patrons are often packed close together, although on the night we visited the place was not crowded. We sat by the side of the stage, near an elegant Spanish gentleman, clearly an enthusiast, who called out encouragement to the dancers at the right moments.   The show was centered on but not limited to classical flamenco. Some of the numbers were closer to ballet; others resembled popular dance. One was even performed to the recorded strains of the overture from \"Carmen,\" which outsiders often take to be the quintessential Andalusian anthem but which was in fact composed by Georges Bizet, who was French, and has little if anything to do with flamenco.   The troupe at El Patio Sevillano totaled 14 dancers, guitarists and jaleadores. As soon as one number was over, the dancers rushed upstairs to change into new costumes while others took the stage. This was a highly polished show, ready to be lifted intact by some ambitious promoter who wanted to introduce Spanish dancing abroad. Purists might scorn some parts of it, but the per formers were accomplished professionals. The jaleadores added an air of authenticity to a show that was aimed mainly at tourists.   The next night we visited a smaller tavern, El Arenal. Housed in a 17th-century building on a small, hard-to-find alley, its walls are covered with drawings of flamenco dancers and scenes of senoritas flirting with bullfighters. While the show was not as seamlessly choreographed as others we had seen, it was probably the most authentic we saw in Spain. The dancers performed with unbridled emotion, seemingly heedless of the audience. \"This time I feel like I'm sitting around a Gypsy campfire,\" one of my companions said as we sipped our sangria.   We were disappointed to find no flamenco being performed in Cordoba during our visit, and traveled with high hopes from there to our final stop, Granada. Home to the legendary Alhambra, the Moorish castle that is the most popular tourist attraction in Spain, Granada is always packed with tourists, and flamenco shows are part of the standard fare.   Following the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel, we chose a place called Jardines de Neptuno. We should have balked when the concierge told us that a bus would pick us up at the hotel. We began to worry when the bus stopped at several other hotels, filled up with tourists, and then parked at our destination behind two other full-sized buses. Inside, the showplace was a three-sided arena with sloping rows like those at a sports stadium, and seats for 800 patrons. As far as we could tell, there was not a single Spaniard in the house, and understandably so. The show was painfully commercial, a virtually unrecognizable mixture of flamenco, salsa and various other Latin styles.   Most of the performers at Jardines de Neptuno were Hollywood-pretty, but the choreographers were evidently unconcerned with authenticity. The spectators didn't seem to mind. They chattered loudly in English and German, and one man in the front row clapped incessantly along with the jaleadores as if he were at a sing-along festival. We confronted the concierge later, and he replied with a philosophical shrug. \"If flamenco is alive today,\" he said, \"it is because of tourists.\"   In 1922, the composer Manuel de Falla and the poet Federico Garcia Lorca, among others, organized a flamenco festival in Granada to revive its classical roots. Aficionados in the city this year for the weeklong Flamenco Encounter in Granada (to be held in either June or October) or in Cordoba for the Flamenco-Guitar Festival (two weeks in July, still to be designated) can follow suit by immersing themselves in the art of flamenco. Those in Seville may catch sight of the filming, beginning next week, of \"Flamenco,\" a movie by Carlos Saura. \"Other forms of popular music come and go,\" he said, \"but flamenco is constantly renewing itself. This is an especially good moment -- lots of exciting new performers.\" WHERE TO GO TO WATCH THE DANCERS    For information about flamenco festivals, write to the National Tourist Office of Spain, 665 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022.

Hotels and cultural sites on the island off the east coast of Africa had fallen into disrepair owing to government neglect. But in the last few years, the Government (Zanzibar and Tanganyika united in 1964 to become Tanzania) has encouraged tourism investment, and improved facilities have begun drawing travelers, many of them adding stops on Zanzibar to longer East Africa tours. One of the island's chief attractions is the Stone Town section of the city of Zanzibar, with its narrow, winding streets and balconied limestone houses with ornately carved doors. Visitors also may tour farms where clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom are grown, or swim at Indian Ocean beaches.    One company that operates East African tours, Wildlife Safari, offers a two-night stay on Zanzibar before any of its trips. Participants stay in the Dhow Palace, a Stone Town house converted to a 10-room hotel.  The cost of $295 a person, based on two in a room, includes breakfast and sightseeing.  Travel to Zanzibar is usually by a flight from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian coast, followed by a 22-mile hydrofoil ride. Round-trip fare is $300, according to the company.

With Dallas trailing, 38-28, midway through the fourth quarter and driving to cut it closer, Troy Aikman's pass to Michael Irvin was incomplete near the 49er goal line.

Its initial reception at the Metropolitan Opera in 1958 was wildly enthusiastic; Dimitri Mitropoulos, who conducted the first performance, exclaimed, \"At last, an American grand opera!\" But the Met lost interest in the work a few years later, and Cecil Beaton's sumptuous sets were destroyed in a 1973 fire. The Washington Opera's visually splendid new staging, a co-production with the Dallas Opera that opened on Saturday at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, is one of very few attempts at this score in recent decades.   The principal reason for the opera's neglect is probably Gian Carlo Menotti's soggy libretto, which aims for the Gothic passions of Isak Dinesen and the subtle epiphanies of Chekhov but instead achieves a kind of uneventful, unpoetic melodrama. Vanessa, the melancholy aristocrat, falls for the young, caddish Anatol, the son of her former lover. Erika, her no less melancholy niece, also sleeps with Anatol, becomes pregnant and aborts her child to avoid compromising her aunt.

All that is moot now, however. The deed is done and it need not be the disaster for the city's homeless that their advocates fear.   For one thing, the old rule -- which stipulated that anyone who applied for shelter by midnight had to be placed by 8 the next morning -- gave housing officials no time to decide whether applicants had a valid case, or whether other solutions could be found. For another, it created a standard no city administration could meet.

She, an Amazon molly fish, had sought copulation with a male, not to obtain his genes and mix them with her own to spawn the next generation, but simply for a quick chemical jump start. She needed his sperm to prod her eggs to split in twain and create clonal progeny, the fry all female and identical to the mother.    For his part, the male, a closely related species of molly fish that propagates through more normal channels of sexual reproduction, also appeared to benefit from the odd affair. As scientists showed last year, the male molly fish that copulates with an Amazon becomes immediately irresistible to the females of his own kind, who then hungrily mate with him and give his seed a chance to sire piscine multitudes. In this way, scientists proposed, a so-called gynogenetic species like the Amazon can persist, gaining the chemical prod of a male's sperm without giving him offspring in return.

Dexter Scott King, 33, the youngest son among the four King children, has succeeded succeed her.   Speaking to nearly 400 people gathered at Ebenezer Baptist Church on the 10th annual observance of the King holiday to mark what would have been Dr. King's 66th birthday, Mrs. King said she saw reasons for hope as crises abated in places like Rwanda, Haiti and parts of the Middle East, even though civil strife continued in places like Nigeria, Bosnia and Russia.   \"The most positive development for the state of the dream worldwide since we last met has been the establishment of a great new democracy in South Africa,\" she said.   Domestically, she said, political leaders seemed focused on budget deficits when the nation had a serious \"compassion deficit.\" Nevertheless, Mrs. King said she was optimistic about the future as she left the leadership of the King center to write about her life after her husband's assassination and to pursue some \"long overdue\" musical projects that would put her conservatory training as a singer to use.   \"I am leaving this ship of hope in good hands,\" she said of her son.   Since taking over last month, Mr. King has been involved in a public dispute with the National Park Service over control of a main site in the King Historic District here and the right to construct a major memorial to his father.   Only oblique mention was made of that dispute today as some who have been critical of the King center in the dispute, like Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta, sat on the dais alongside King family members for the official observance of the holiday.   But a reminder of the dispute was just outside the door of the church and across the street. There stood the half-demolished hulk of the city's Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, which city officials have deeded to the National Park Service over the objections of the King family for the construction of an $11 million visitors' center. If completed, the center is likely to become the gateway to the historic district, setting the tone for an estimated three million visitors a year, and possibly eclipsing the King family's plans for a high-tech, interactive museum.   In a voice strikingly reminiscent of the cadence and phrasing of his father, Dexter King said that Dr. King was part of American history and \"belonged to everyone spiritually\" but that his family was the guardian of his legacy until his dream was fulfilled.   \"My father delivered political freedom and I would like to deliver economic freedom,\" Mr. King said, sketching a goal that he said the King center was likely to pursue under his leadership. \"Had his life not been cut short, I believe economic empowerment would have been the next step and the King center should be the catalyst in that goal,\" he said. \"I'm calling home all those freedom fighters who marched with my father. Dexter Scott King is going to be there with you this time, and we will make it to the promise land.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Is the Future of China in Deng's Iron Hand?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/opinion/l-is-the-future-of-china-in-deng-s-iron-hand-434495.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Deng's Daughter Opens a Long-Shut Door\" (front page, Jan. 13): In anticipating the passing of the ailing Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, some Beijing leaders summoned to see him recently were startled by the harshness of his final bits of advice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Woman Held In Drowning Of Two Sons Is Arraigned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/us/woman-held-in-drowning-of-two-sons-is-arraigned.html","abstract":"  Covering her eyes with her hands at the mention of her dead sons, Susan V.
