It had become hard to define. Who could tell what distinguished the avant-garde from the merely idiosyncratic? Or from the just plain weird?   Now in its eighth season, the Serious Fun festival, which began last Wednesday and is to run through July 30, has spawned the sort of confusion that comes with growth and change. Critics say the whole thing has gotten too serious. Or maybe that it's too much fun. In any case, as Lincoln Center, with a new director of programming, Jane S. Moss, is mulling over a restructuring of all its special-performance series, no one seems entirely certain what Serious Fun is supposed to be. And though Ms. Moss said plans for next year's festival were under way, she acknowledged that performance-art programming under the Serious Fun rubric at Lincoln Center was not immune to change.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940713","headline":"At Issue: What Is Adequate for the Poor?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/nyregion/paying-for-new-jersey-s-schools-impact-issue-what-adequate-for-poor.html","abstract":"  With today's ruling, the New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed the state's duty to provide effective schooling, not just equal spending, for all students, especially those in struggling urban districts.

The players, who have made this work a specialty in recent years, did not bear down on the four notes with portentous solemnity. Instead, after two hours of exploring Bach's inventiveness and spiritual grandeur, in a work in which themes were expanded, contracted, turned upside down, combined with themselves and their variants in an encyclopedia of possibilities, the quartet played the theme with quiet, eloquent simplicity.   The tension immediately increased; it was as if a spring were being pulled back. Two themes had already been heard in the majestic fugue. But this third, signature theme, which has long been used as a tribute to the composer (in German, B is B-flat and H is B-natural), was clearly an announcement of something more sublime than had yet been achieved. A hint of what was to come was heard as the three themes intertwined, awaiting some sort of fulfillment. Then, without warning, the first violin fell mute, the second violin followed, as did the cello, and for brief moments there were only the eighth notes of the viola, which ended in silent space. That is where Bach is said to have left the manuscript at his death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940713","headline":"Cam's Card Shark 3-2 Choice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/sports/cam-s-card-shark-3-2-choice.html","abstract":"  Cam's Card Shark, the leading horse in harness racing who has dominated the 3-year-old division, was installed yesterday as the 3-2 morning-line favorite over nine rivals in Saturday night's $1 million Meadowlands Pace.

Mr. Marsalis's new album, a collaboration with DJ Premier of the rap group Gang Starr called \"Buckshot LeFonque\" (Columbia), further muddles the issue of credibility.

The dwindling and aging membership of Congregation Derech Emunoh somehow found the wherewithal to keep it open, cherishing the moments they could spend praying in the same pews that had supported their parents and grandparents.   But the determination of its 40 members came close to exhaustion yesterday morning when an early-morning fire destroyed much of the synagogue's ceiling and roof. Fire department officials said the two-alarm blaze was suspicious in origin, and because it involved a synagogue, the case was being investigated by the police as a possible bias incident. Though the 600-seat structure could be rebuilt, the president of the synagogue said he did not believe it was worth trying to raise the necessary funds when the congregation was already barely surviving on its memories. 'This Is the End'    \"I doubt very much that we will have a congregation here any longer,\" said Robert Wein, the president, a third-generation member of Derech Emunoh who travels from Manhattan every week to pray next to the memorial plaque with his grandfather's name on it. \"To spend hundreds of thousands on the roof when there is no Jewish community here any longer -- it's just not practical.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide. \"I am afraid of the end results.\" A Long View    Some Haitians said they remained optimistic that a peaceful way could be found out of the impasse that has hardened since army leaders ousted Father Aristide in September 1991.  \"We spent 300 years in slavery,\" said Bayyinah Bello, who works with several local political groups. \"So three years in the life of a people is no time.\"   The Haitian military's campaign of terror has largely been aimed at the local organizations that form the backbone of Father Aristide's support, trying to insure that if the exiled President returns, he will not be able to govern.   The level of intimidation increased on Monday after the army-backed Government ordered all human rights observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States to leave Haiti by today. On Tuesday, about 12 bodies riddled with bullets were dumped into a shallow grave near Leogane, 18 miles west.    In the months that they have been in the country, the 100 or so monitors have concluded that many killings were directly attributable to the army and its allies.  A Sample of Intimidation    Today, two men who said they were supporters of the exiled President walked into Father Tiest's downtown office and told him they needed help. But the priest said he became suspicious when the men showed him a picture of Father Aristide instead of identification.    One man drew a gun and demanded files. Father Tiest said a worker then screamed for help and the men fled. \"These are assassins and criminals,\" the priest said.   With the departure of the international observers, Haitian human rights workers are wondering how effectively they can do their work.    \"We find ourselves alone in the face of the reality of political repression,\" said Jean Robert Vaval, of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights. \"But we will continue to fight for human rights. It's our job.\"   Mr. Vaval and others said that while much attention had been given to the plight of Haitian boat people, the refugeees within the country were an even more serious problem. These refugees, estimated at 350,000, have left their jobs and homes and live in a different city every week, trying to keep ahead of marauding soldiers.   One such refugee, a man in his 30's, said he was a member of a political organization in the Artibonite Valley in northwest Haiti. Since the coup, he said, he has moved from house to house until finding refuge in a Port-au-Prince church.  Pay Attention, World    \"I am not afraid because I have weathered the worst,\" he said, adding that he was arrested several months ago and released because of the intervention of the international observers. \"But too many people have suffered for me and now I don't want to jeopardize their lives.\"   The international monitors have been been reluctant to talk, fearing their comments might upset Haiti's military leaders. But many have voiced sadness at having to leave without completing their task.    \"I hope that the international community thinks this is enough and takes some decisive action to end this crisis now,\" said one member of the mission. \"It's a turning point because some people have perceived before that this was mainly a U.S. problem.\"                     --------------------       Corpses as a Weapon    WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) -- Haiti's rulers are intensifying repression, and their latest tactic is to dump the bodies of murdered political opponents in the streets to terrorize the people, a State Department official said today.    The official, Nancy Ely-Raphel, from the department's human rights section, said that in the past two weeks, several corpses of young men with their hands tied behind their backs had been found in the streets of Port-au-Prince.    Ms. Ely-Raphel said 133 killings had been reported between February and May. But she added: \"We believe we may now be seeing a further ratcheting up of repression. The latest developments include increased dumping of bodies in public areas of Port-au-Prince in an attempt to terrorise the populace.\"                     --------------------       Exercise in Bahamas    WASHINGTON, July 13 (AP) -- Several hundred United States marines began a practice invasion-and-rescue operation today on Grand Inagua Island in the Bahamas, 150 miles northwest of Haiti, Pentagon sources said.

Mr. Williams was a relatively unknown singer based in Chicago, and Count Basie was suffering from the general decline in interest in big bands. Their collaboration, matching a gleaming, industrial-strength orchestra with the dry and clipped singing of Mr. Williams, was a high point in blues culture, and \"Every Day I Have the Blues,\" a single from the album, rose to the No. 2 spot on the rhythm-and-blues charts.   Since then Count Basie has died, and blues culture is fading away as a training ground for younger musicians. But Mr. Williams, who is appearing through Sunday at the Blue Note, backed by the Count Basie Orchestra led by Frank Foster, remains something special, a way into a sound and musical attitude that by and large no longer exist. And on the basis of the first set on Tuesday night, Mr. Williams, 75, is more than able to make a lesson in history seem utterly contemporary, turning his art into something thrilling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940714","headline":"Helping Excite Toronto Over Books for 20 Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/14/books/helping-excite-toronto-over-books-for-20-years.html","abstract":"  It's 8 P.M. on a Tuesday in a cultural center on transformed industrial land along Lake Ontario.

When the doors open on the 65th floor, you find yourself in a long glass, ebony and mahogany hall that makes you feel you have stepped right into a 1930's movie set. No matter what you saw the last time you looked into a mirror, you now feel chic, beautiful and sophisticated.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Changing Young Lives On the Streets of Italy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/movies/changing-young-lives-on-the-streets-of-italy.html","abstract":"The story of a teacher who changes the lives of streetwise students in a Neapolitan village seems utterly predictable. It also sounds totally wrong for Lina Wertmuller, who made her name with savvy, tough-minded films like \"Seven Beauties.\" Yet in the delightful, sweet-tempered comedy \"Ciao, Professore!\" the teacher is transformed in ways that link him to earlier, imperfect Wertmuller characters. By the end of this idealistic teacher's brief stay in the village of Corzano, his most rebellious student tells him: \"You stole a van; you smacked a nun against a wall. A few weeks more, and you'd learn how to live.\" The boy means it as a compliment, and in this case he's right.    The teacher, Marco Sperelli (Paolo Villaggio), was assigned to his rough-and-tumble third-grade class by a minor computer error. He was meant to teach in the more refined northern town of Corsano but instead was assigned to Corzano in the crime-ridden south. In that crowded village, education means nothing next to scraping together a living. Even the children help in the family businesses: hawking stolen cigarettes on the street, or working in restaurants, barber shops and fruit stands.

So why would anyone want to pedal from Manhattan to Montauk? There is, after all, more accommodating and cheery real estate available to the acquisitive cyclist than Long Island, at least that portion of it between the East River and the South Fork, a stretch that many New Yorkers are familiar with only through strategy sessions aimed at devising the quickest, most painless traverses -- via motorized transport, of course -- on Friday and Sunday evenings.   However, as a cyclist who has made big chunks of the trip a dozen times in the last few years of renting a summer house near the beach -- and now the whole thing -- I can report that the journey is a worthwhile enterprise. At more than a century (cycle-ese for a 100-mile ride), it's not a wise endeavor for the physically unprepared. The route has its pitfalls, yes. Long Island isn't exactly Paumonok anymore, the Indians' beach-rimmed woodland in the shape of a fish, and I don't think residents of Nassau County or even western Suffolk should be surprised or offended to learn that for the cyclist, their home terrain is no velodrome.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940715","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/sports/results-plus-671959.html","abstract":"  TENNIS  Lendl Returns, Rallies  Ivan Lendl, sidelined since May with back pain, returned last night and advanced with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Jim Grabb in the United States Pro Tennis Championships in Brookline, Mass. Lendl, who had not played since losing to Arnaud Boetsch in the first round of the French Open, advanced to the quarterfinals. He was down a set and trailing by 2-1 in the second set when he won six straight games.

The defending champion Greg Hamilton of Canoe Brook was the only other player threatening the lead when play at the Metedeconk National Golf Club in Jackson, N.J., was stopped.

Two political parties were formed under military tutelage; two carefully screened candidates were allowed to contest the presidency. Even so, when voters failed to approve the regime's first choice, the military ruler broke his promises, annulled the election and robbed the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, of victory.    The result has been a grass-roots pro-democratic uprising that the current military clique has been unable to quell. The crisis deepened a few weeks ago when Mr. Abiola, a Muslim and millionaire with a following in Nigeria's non-Muslim south, proclaimed himself President on the first anniversary of the canceled election. For that he was charged with treason, held incommunicado and threatened with a life sentence.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee want to know, and over the last three days they have poked into unusual corners of Judge Stephen G. Breyer's life to find out. Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, looked for literary landmarks. Judge Breyer's response spoke volumes.    Q. Tell me your favorite books.   A. Where do people start? They start with Shakespeare. Say why Shakespeare and you say why -- -- this I tell students, you know, a lot of them come from some different school and they'll come from some place, they say, 'What's in Shakespeare for me?' You say, 'Well, if you're willing to put in the time, he's a little bit archaic, you know, the language, but if you put in the time, what you see there is, you see every different person, you see every different kind of person, you see every situation there is in the world. You see people saying things that they would say if only they had that ability to say them. And you see the whole thing in poetry.'   I mean, that's why people turn to that and they turn to that a little bit in literature to get some of the things that Senator  [ Paul ]  Simon was talking about, I think, which is what's in the heart of that person who is leading that different kind of life. And sometimes you can find some of that in literature.   I like Conrad very much. Why? I think because I'm moved often by the way in which he talks about the need for people -- all of us -- to learn from the past and then to give something to the future. Whether that's through our families or whether that's through our careers, we do learn from our parents, we do learn from the past, we do try to transmit things of value. And I think he finds value in human communities. I think he finds human communities to be ultimately the sources of obligations and values toward each other.   I read something that moved me a lot not very long ago. I was reading something by Chesterton, and he was talking about one of the Brontes, I think her \"Jane Eyre.\" He says you go and look out at the city -- I think he was looking at London -- and he said you know, you see all those houses now, even at the end of the 19th century, and they look all as if they're the same. And you think all those people are out there going to work and they're all the same.    He says, but what Bronte tells you is they're not the same. Each one of those persons in each one of those houses and each one of those families is different, and they each have a story to tell. Each of those stories involves something about human passion. Each of those stories involves a man, a woman, children, families, work, lives -- and you get that sense out of the book.    And so sometimes I've found literature very helpful as a way out of the tower.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Hulk Hogan, on Witness Stand, Tells of Steroid Use in Wrestling","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/nyregion/hulk-hogan-on-witness-stand-tells-of-steroid-use-in-wrestling.html","abstract":"  He is famous as the flamboyant wrestler Hulk Hogan.

Roberto Baggio's exit in the 71st minute of the semifinal victory over Bulgaria on Wednesday had appeared more triumphant than ominous. His sentimental journey from the temporary grass at Giants Stadium at the tearful conclusion of the game held no signs of anguish.   It was not until Baggio was asked about the enormousness of his two-goal effort that propelled the Azzurri into the World Cup final for the first time since 1982 that his condition began to become clear. In a sport that transforms victims of the most harmless collisions into apparent candidates for amputation in their pursuit of yellow cards, the potential severity of Baggio's right hamstring injury was somehow obscured. That is, until the first question after Baggio emerged from the dressing room, a standard for lottery winners and heroes:   \"How do you feel?\" No Conclusive Answers    The question had to do with Baggio's joyous sense of accomplishment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Anderson Leaves Knicks for Spain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/sports/sports-people-basketball-anderson-leaves-knicks-for-spain.html","abstract":"  The former University of Indiana forward ERIC ANDERSON, who spent the last two seasons with the Knicks, signed a contract with Andorra of the Spanish League's First Division on Wednesday.

Updated from the 1951 film starring Paul Douglas as George Knox, a hard-hearted baseball coach, the new version has a glowering Danny Glover in the role of Knox, who is now the bitter, scowling manager of the California Angels.    The Angels, who are in last place, are so bad that their playing is buffoonish. But with some unexpected heavenly intervention, they begin performing wondrous feats. What transforms the team from pathetic clowns into heroic ones is a little boy's fervent prayer. When Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an 11-year-old foster child, hears his father, a drifter, sarcastically remark that the chances of the family's reuniting are as good as those of the Angels winning the pennant, the boy takes it as a promise. That night, Roger prays to a star for the Angels to win the pennant, and it twinkles back at him. The very next day, winged, white-robed seraphim, visible only to Roger, appear in the stadium to help the players make impossible catches, hit crucial home runs and throw some of the fastest balls ever pitched.
