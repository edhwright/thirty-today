Although there are daredevils who play the complete set in concert (several have done so in recent New York seasons), most cellists play one suite on a program, surrounded by works in different styles. Indeed, Bach might have looked askance at anyone willing either to play or to hear all six works in a sitting or two.   But on recordings, resistance to the compendium approach is largely futile. The medium imposes the expectation that works of a feather will flock together, concert hall esthetics notwithstanding. Besides, the suites fit handily on two CD's and make powerful calling cards for cellists. And there's a machismo issue. Barring extenuating circumstances, a recording that offers only selections from the series is tacitly regarded as an installment toward a complete traversal or a sign that the musician who made it is an eccentric or a wimp.   This approach puts a strain on cellists' imaginations, which is not necessarily a bad thing. As remarkably varied as these suites are once one looks into them, they are similar in their externals. And however fondly one regards the sound of the cello, it can become monotonous in the two and a quarter hours it takes to play the suites. The challenge for a cellist, therefore, is to magnify the variety Bach wrote into the set.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"Tree Tips Over, and a Block Rises Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-tree-tips-over-and-a-block-rises-up.html","abstract":"  There are 19 trees on 100th Street between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive.

In the largest exhibition of his work ever mounted -- more than 600 works -- the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin is now seeking to portray him as a multitalented figure who skipped effortlessly from expressionism to Dada to realism, not simply a master of painting and drawing but also a photographer, poet, collagist, designer, illustrator, pornographer, dandy and outraged opponent of Nazism.    Grosz was an artist who thrived on contradictions, and many of them are visible in \"George Grosz: Berlin-New York,\" which opened last month and runs through April 17.

Unrepentantly partisan, it has glorified the homegrown and avoided pretension in its mission to frame the humor, poetry and music of what is sometimes called the street, defined as anything American, anything separate from the academy. And the party, which runs Tuesday through Sunday, explains where the club has been: Allen Ginsberg, Shirley Horn, Bobby Short, Dick Gregory, Pete Seeger and Professor Irwin Corey are all showing up to pay tribute and to perform.   That list -- and the staggering lineup of performers over the years, from Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen to John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk -- also suggests that the Vanguard, small, underground and unprepossesing, has been a witness to and participant in a startling transformation: the elevation of its esthetic from the marginal and hip to the mainstream.

James Fox portrays the doctor, who along with Vanya falls in love with the indolent, unhappy Yelena. The play, in a version by Jean-Claude van Itallie, is directed by Braham Murray, an artistic director at the Royal Exchange.

(And the British seemed to know better than anyone every reason in the book for doing nothing.)

As a result we were very interested in \"By Rail Around the North Island of New Zealand\" (Dec. 4). The writer clearly had a wonderful time and presented her experiences very well, but we think the reader will get the wrong impression: Railroads are not the method of choice to see New Zealand. We would urge that anyone wishing to really see the wonders of this country to choose either tour bus or autosince the railroads do not go to many of them. We traveled by both road and rail and there is no question which is preferable. D. LEONARD WERNER  New York, N.Y. Susan Spano, the author, responds: You probably do see more by road travel, but it can also be more costly. While in New Zealand, I spotted a brochure for a low-cost bus tour operated by the Ice Bus Northland, Post Office Box 1553, Auckland, New Zealand. It makes numerous stops across the North Island, allowing passengers to get off and on at will, with reservations at hostels. You pay point to point; for example, $49 from Auckland to the Bay of Islands.

In part, it was the admission price, probably higher because of the loss of grants.    But I was also dismayed that barely five years since one of the most historic events of the second half of this century, there is only minimal recognition that the checkpoint, the symbol of freedom for some and oppression for others, ever stood on Unter den Linden. Only a small sign, not even an official one, reading \"Checkpoint Charlie,\" and a few capitalists offering Cold War relics and chunks of the wall attest that this Berlin intersection has any significance.

Every age believes itself the worst and the last. True music lovers forever stand on a lonely outcrop shored up against the universal deluge of the crass. Even strong-willed futurists like Richard Wagner and Arnold Schoenberg predicated their philosophy on an apocalyptic vision of contemporary culture that only drastic action could redeem. Music is perpetually betraying the great tradition, lowering standards, surrendering to contemporary taste, dumbing down and dying off.   Walking through the aisles of the larger compact-disk emporiums, or reading some of the more impetuous announcements put out by P.R. firms, one is tempted to say, Yes, things always look worse than they are, but this time the world really is coming to an end. Some possible portents of doom: a recording that advertises Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as \"the 'Star Wars' of symphonic music\" and Ludwig van B. himself as the Kurt Cobain of his generation; a famous young virtuoso playing \"The Four Seasons\" in a music video broadcast on the Weather Channel; arousing anthologies of \"Sensual Classics\" aimed at heterosexual or homosexual listeners; disks of Arvo Part's music stamped with a descriptive blurb from Michael Stipe of R.E.M.

Only a small sign, not even an official one, reading \"Checkpoint Charlie,\" and a few capitalists offering Cold War relics and chunks of the wall attest that this Berlin intersection has any significance.

Last week, the New York State Senate approved legislation raising the speed limit. If an agreement on a joint bill is reached with the Assembly, Gov. Geroge E.

There will always be an audience for Slayer's music because there will always be a subculture trying to escape from prosaic day-to-day existence by making a fetish of death and the unknown. And whether Slayer was singing morbidly realistic lines like \"No mercy, no reason, just pain\" or obsessive nonsense like \"Demons are waiting to die for you\" when it performed on Friday night at Roseland, it seemed like a group of entertainers caught on a treadmill of gore.   \"Now we're going to do something we've never done before, a love song,\" Slayer's bassist and vocalist, Tom Araya, announced to a chorus of boos from the audience at the first of two sold-out shows. \"It ends in death,\" he continued as the crowd predictably burst into thunderous applause and Slayer began \"213,\" named after Jeffrey Dahmer's old apartment number. The song is from Slayer's new album, \"Divine Intervention\" (American Recordings), which went straight to No. 8 on the pop charts when it was released last year, proving just how many people share Slayer's morbid obsessions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/nyregion/news-summary-127995.html","abstract":"  International A2-7 PRICE OF A BAILOUT  The U.S. is preparing to announce details of its plan to help rescue Mexico from its currency crisis, including toughened restrictions that will most likely send interest rates in Mexico soaring.

Yet if Washington wants to sustain political support for disarming Iraq, it must be ready to relax the embargo when Baghdad does comply.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950221","headline":"On My Mind; Working in Tijuana","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/opinion/on-my-mind-working-in-tijuana.html","abstract":"  Here I am in Tijuana and instead of buying a rhinestoned sombrero souvenir, licking salt and slugging down a tequila, peering around for Mexicans plotting to sneak into the United States or doing other useful border-type things, I am just wandering around thinking of four fellows I have left in the car -- Rudy Giuliani, Jack Kemp, Mario Cuomo and William Bennett.

Using modern laboratory methods, chemists have recently identified more than 600 carotenoids in plants, including about 40 that are prominent in common fruits and vegetables.

Define the Issue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/us/anti-crime-bill-as-political-dispute-president-and-gop-define-the-issue.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 Most Americans think that having more police officers on the streets is a good way to fight crime. So do most police officers and both political parties. So why, in the recent House debate over crime legislation, did the matter of providing more police become the central dispute and the magnet that drew President Clinton's first explicit threat to veto a bill?   The basic dynamic driving the legislation that emerged from the House last week was this: Mr. Clinton and the Democrats swiped the crime issue from the Republicans. Then the Republicans got it back, not by any bold move but by relentless criticism of the 1994 anti-crime legislation. With last November's elections having left the Democrats in disarray on virtually every front, the President now finds himself fighting desperately to reclaim the issue. - Tony Blankley, press secretary for Speaker Newt Gingrich, summed up the Democrats' situation by quoting an old American position on the Panama Canal: \"You can't take it from us, because we stole it fair and square.\"   Never mind that many criminologists believe that crime cannot be fought with Federal legislation. Never mind that previous efforts from Washington have generally been considered ineffective.   For Republicans, the crime issue has been theirs almost by birthright. It was only when a Democratic candidate for President finally said, as Mr. Clinton did in 1992, that he favored the death penalty -- and allowed the execution of a brain-damaged man to go forward before the New Hampshire primary -- that the Republicans began to lose the issue.   Public opinion polls in January 1994 showed crime overtaking the economy as the biggest perceived problem facing the nation. And for the first time, voters thought Democrats and Republicans could handle it equally well.   Since then, the President has signed into law some popular crime-fighting measures. These include a ban on assault weapons and a three-strikes-and-you're-out provision that imposes life sentences on criminals convicted of a Federal crime after two previous convictions.   The Republicans, who can read polls as well as anyone, did not challenge either the ban or the three-strikes proposal in their Contract With America, their 1994 campaign manifesto.   Nor did the contract directly challenge another major element of last year's anti-crime law -- Mr. Clinton's pledge to put 100,000 additional police officers on the street.   The contract's main thrust on crime was to build more prisons, make prisoners serve longer sentences, prevent criminals from getting off on technicalities and cut the prevention programs that Democrats had stuffed into last year's bill.   While there are deep philosophical differences between the parties over how to fight crime, Republicans in the House did not really object to the Democrats' desire to hire more police officers. Indeed, the contract called for \"additional law enforcement,\" an acknowledgment that this was a good idea.   But they saw the President's pledge for 100,000 new officers as dishonest, saying the bill would not come close to paying for that many and would provide communities with only seed money for five years. They also argued that some communities did not need or want more officers, and that the legislation should have concentrated the new officers in high-crime areas. And they portrayed the prevention programs as wasteful social spending.   So the contract collapsed last year's money for police and prevention into a lump sum, or block grant, of $10 billion over five years for local communities to fight crime any way they deemed fit, including the hiring of more police officers.   Over the last two weeks, this provision became the most contentious in the new crime bill, eclipsing other divisive matters that had blocked agreement on crime legislation for nearly a decade. These included measures to allow officers to make searches without warrants and to speed up carrying out executions, in part by ordering Federal courts to defer to state courts.   The Republican changes brought protests from some liberals and some lawyers, who said the changes were a direct assault on fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. (The Republicans even voted down an amendment, proposed by the Democrats, that contained the exact language of the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unlawful searches.)   But for the most part, the Republican changes sailed through the House. Even Mr. Clinton, who once taught constitutional law, did not put up a fuss.   The fact is that these constitutional safeguards are political losers with a public fed up with criminals getting off on technicalities and tired of waiting years for executions to be carried out. Being against them would put Mr. Clinton on the wrong, \"old Democrat\" side of crime.   He made his stand instead on the 100,000 new officers and, for the first time in his White House tenure, he pledged to use the veto against a specific piece of legislation. It was, after all, one of the most visible of his campaign promises to become law, and to retreat on it now would have been unthinkable.   \"It's one of his few popular accomplishments,\" said a Democratic aide in Congress. \"If he lost that it would be a major blow. The White House has probably already cut their commercials for '96 on the 100,000 cops.\"   Even Republicans concede, if backhandedly, that the veto threat on the police issue worked to the President's advantage.   \"They run an Administration by survey research,\" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. And the research shows that governors, mayors and voters believe that more police officers on the beat, along with keeping criminals in prison for their full sentences, is the most effective way to fight crime.\"   Since the November elections, the Administration has been searching for ways to reassert itself. The crime issue, which Mr. Clinton had turned to his advantage before, provides a logical opportunity.   \"There was a feeling that the best way to differentiate himself from the opposition was to make positive pronouncements and to draw lines in the sand,\" said the Democratic aide. \"There was a feeling that he hadn't done a particularly good job with either, and there has been pressure on him to pick a couple of battles.\"   While the Democrats lost the vote in the House on protecting money for the additional police officers, they had other reasons to rejoice: a vote on a separate amendment indicated that they had the numbers to block any attempt to override a veto.   Moreover, the Democrats appeared to have won the war of words. They were able to frame the debate so that it looked as if the Republicans were eliminating 100,000 police officers -- even though they believed their own bill would provide for more officers than the Clinton measure would if local governments chose to spend all of the money on additional police.   And the veto threat, strengthened by the strong support from House Democrats, also translated quickly into hints of accommodation from Republicans in the Senate, where the bills will be taken up next month.   The Senate seems likely to be more accommodating than the House anyway. Some Republican senators do not like block grants for the same reason that House Republicans once opposed them: the money can easily be diverted from its intended purpose.   But the politics could still prove tricky for Mr. Clinton. The Senate could eliminate money for the 100,000 police officers but send the President an otherwise tough anti-crime package in a single bill.   Mr. Blankley, the Gingrich spokesman, said it would be a bad idea for Mr. Clinton to veto such a measure.   \"The way information gets communicated to a general audience is not in multiple paragraphs, but in snippets of headlines, and I don't think he and his party are currently positioned to win in that snippet-information process,\" Mr. Blankley said. \"If he seems to be fighting the Republicans on crime, most people would correctly assume he's wrong. It's been a Republican issue for over 100 years. It's counterintuitive to think that the head of the Democratic Party is tougher.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950221","headline":"Tribute to Robin Williams","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/movies/tribute-to-robin-williams.html","abstract":"  The American Museum of the Moving Image is to honor Robin Williams at its 10th annual tribute Thursday night at the Waldorf-Astoria.

That sentiment pretty much summed up the season that has come to be known as prefall, when designers show clothes that will hit the stores in June for those customers who just can't wait until September to buy new fall clothes.   As opposed to the runway shows set for next month in Milan, Italy, and in Paris, or the shows scheduled for April in New York, whose real purpose is to drum up excitement in the press, these prefall shows are aimed at store buyers. Their purpose is to sell garments, so they tend to be long on wearable styles and short on drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950221","headline":"An Intersectional Air Dispute","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-an-intersectional-air-dispute.html","abstract":"  Some people in northern New Jersey do not like it when jets rumble overhead on their way to Newark International Airport.

The broadly worded measure would bar the spending of Federal money to promote or carry out any program for Federal workers that somehow encourages the acceptance of homosexuality \"as a legitimate and normal lifestyle.\"    According to the North Carolina Republican, the bill is an attempt to roll back \"special rights\" granted to homosexuals by the Clinton Administration. But Mr. Helms does not specify what those special rights are, and for a very good reason: they are a figment of his imagination. Far from removing \"special rights,\" the Helms bill, if enacted, could deny homosexuals the same use of meeting rooms and bulletin boards for posting notices routinely enjoyed by other employee groups, including black or Hispanic employee organizations, and clubs like Weight Watchers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950221","headline":"A Machine That Bridges 2 Worlds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/science/personal-computers-a-machine-that-bridges-2-worlds.html","abstract":"  FOR the young Macintosh enthusiast, it was agony.

Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket, which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19950221","time":"1995-02-21
