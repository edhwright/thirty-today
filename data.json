The debaters quoted are Robert H. Bork, the former Federal judge (for the resolution), and Prof. Linda S. Greene of the University of Wisconsin Law School (against).   BORK -- Political correctness, I think, is something that is widespread in this society, and it's part of a mood of radical egalitarianism which has taken hold. Of course, equality does not occur for all people without coercion.  And I'm afraid that's what we're seeing. We're seeing it in affirmative action and quotas in the universities.  And we're seeing it in the speech codes, which are judging speech not by what it objectively means, but by how somebody perceives it, over which the speaker has no control.    And I think this kind of leveling in speech and of rejection of the achievement principle for quotas isn't going to work. This kind of thing, I think, leads to hostility, a loss of civility and a rejection of the achievement principle upon which this society is really based.   GREENE -- P.C. is a menace, but perhaps for different reasons than the other side would say. It's a menace because it obscures the real problems and issues that we face as a society.  It's a clever rhetorical phrase which turns a debate about racism and sexism into a debate about censorship.   If you can force us to discuss censorship instead of discussing racial epithets, censorship instead of discussing sexual harassment, censorship instead of discussing the question how we are going to transform our institutions into more diverse places, then you have set the terms of the debate and prevented a discussion of the real issues. And it seems to be a great cause of glee on the right, among conservatives, that they have been able to change this debate.    Let's stop attacking young people who come to college, whose parents send them to college with a reasonable expectation that they won't be the victims of racist, derogatory speech. Let's stop attacking the victims and start attacking the problem of racism. P.C. labels prevent that.  The P.C. charge prevents that, and that's why P.C. is a menace. Let's eliminate the phrase and get on with the unfinished business of transforming our society and transforming our educational institutions.   BORK -- Professor Greene, do you think there is more racism in this society today than there was 30 or 40 years ago?   GREENE -- I think that racism has changed its character. I think that racism still exists but its character is different. I think we have two types of racism going on, or at least two. In one type we see the explicit racist remark or the explicit racial decision, sometimes because of an inadvertent slip. Other times we have a veiled racism, not necessarily the product of a person's specific intent, but an unconscious comfort which we have with the status quo.    What we need to do is not to focus on calling each other racist or sexist, but instead to try to understand how historical racism has affected our lives and consciousness and not make charges but try to understand how we all -- white, black, men and women -- have been affected by our past.   BORK -- Professor Greene, I think none of us on this side of the table disagrees that people could be punished for making open racial or ethnic insults in a university. That is not the question in which this arises. This arises when students steal a student newspaper because they regard it as racist, although it's just conservative, or when a professor is put through sensitivity training for a remark that was not really offensive in the classroom, that's political correctness, and that's what we object to and it's happening. It's not just a question of forbidding talk about racism.   GREENE -- Well, is it political correctness because the university expresses a concern? It seems to me that if we eliminate the label of political correctness from our debate, we can talk more explicitly about what speech we want to empower people to engage in.   Let's stop talking about political correctness and instead talk frankly about what we want people to be able to say at the university. Are we saying that we want students to be able to say anything they wish to another person? Are we saying that we want faculty to be free to make remarks, however offensive or threatening to their students? Are we saying that we want professors to be able to make sexual remarks to their students?   All I am saying is that the P.C. charge prevents us from discussing the rules of decorum in the university. I think that when you mention acts like the stealing of newspapers  [ at Penn ]  or other acts of this nature, we all understand that these acts occur in a context. I don't think we want to continue to focus on these specific incidents. I think what we need to talk about is the way that the characterization of this debate prevents us from really discussing how much freedom a professor should -- we've both been professors. I'm a professor now.  You've been a professor. You know how important it is to be free to speak and to not be misunderstood.   BORK -- Nobody on this side of the table is saying we should not discuss racism or sexism and how to deal with it.   GREENE -- Judge Bork, don't you think that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the free speech debate? We don't have an outcry over the regulation of speech in the context of stock offerings; we don't worry about regulating speech in the area of copyright, plagiarism.   Some of the conservatives are perfectly happy to suppress pornography and obscenity or other types of advertising. So how would you make the distinction between that speech which ought to be permitted and that speech which we ought to suppress?   BORK -- At the core of the First Amendment -- which I take it is the emblem of free speech in our society -- there is concern for political speech, concern for speech about ideas, about social matters, and so forth. There is no concern about speech -- at least there wasn't originally concern about speech which expresses no idea, but merely expresses hatred or obscenity or something of that sort.    If somebody says, for example, that Asian-American students turn out to be better at mathematics and physics than others, I take it a speech code might land them on that person.  That's political correctness, and that's wrong. We've got to be free to discuss differences, abilities, and so forth. But when you get to a code about a stock offering, you're merely saying don't sell somebody a product that you have lied about.   GREENE -- It seems that you're supporting the idea that we can regulate some hate speech ----   BORK -- In a university. In a university.   GREENE -- In the university. And hate speech which might be one person making a personally directed racial epithet at another person. Wouldn't you agree that that ought to be, if not punishable, certainly subject to some type of university discipline and correction?   BORK -- There certainly ought to be. I remember there was an episode at Brown University not long ago in which a drunken student went out in the quadrangle and shrieked anti-Semitic remarks, and the dean had him in and I think he was suspended. I don't have much trouble with that.    GREENE -- How do you explain that there is so much intellectual and political firepower marshaled in favor of people who want to yell epithets and derogatory, hurtful language?  How do we explain this marshaling of energy and intellect in support of people who want to act this way towards others?   BORK -- I think nobody does.   GREENE -- Well, then, would you agree with me that what we need to do is talk about the real issues and stop hurling our charges at each other?    BORK -- Oh, the charges are much more fun.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931211","headline":"Isles Call Up A Goaltender","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/11/sports/hockey-isles-call-up-a-goaltender.html","abstract":"  The Islanders yesterday called up goaltender Jamie McLellan from their Salt Lake City minor league affiliate on an emergency basis because of a back injury suffered by Tom Draper during his off-ice conditioning session on Wednesday.

In the room were two dozen advocates for a wide range of government reforms, including term limits, stronger ethics codes and campaign finance restrictions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931211","headline":"For Lapps, A Hesitant Cultural Flowering","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/11/arts/for-lapps-a-hesitant-cultural-flowering.html","abstract":"  These days, the midnight sun is at the other end of the world.

But there are people here, too: the Samis, as the Lapps call themselves, who once herded reindeer and who are now adjusting, sometimes awkwardly, to modern life. This is the United Nations' International Year of Indigenous People, and Norway, Finland, Sweden and Russia have been full of events celebrating Sami cultural achievement. These celebrations are turned as much inward, toward Sami self-awareness and cultural redefinition, as outward, which would lure even more of the tourists about whom the Samis are profoundly ambivalent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931211","headline":"The Mayor-elect Builds Bridges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/11/opinion/the-mayor-elect-builds-bridges.html","abstract":"  New York City's Mayor-elect, Rudolph Giuliani, started work on two essential bridges this week -- to Washington and Albany.

Accordingly, the play, which has garnered considerable attention since its premiere at the Actors Theater of Louisville, Ky., in March, unfolds as a point-counterpoint presentation of irreconcilable points of view. There are lightning flashes of eloquence but, in spite of a truly shocking denouement, surprisingly few moments of dramatic urgency in this story of a young pregnant woman who is kidnapped from a clinic by members of a militant anti-abortion organization.

On the traditional side is a performance of Bach's \"Christmas Oratorio,\" to be presented in its entirety by the Taghkanic Chorale and Amor Artis Orchestra playing period instruments under the direction of Johannes Somary. The concert will be held at the Paramount Center for the Arts, at 1008 Brown Street in Peekskill.   The first cantata of the three-hour Baroque masterpiece was first performed with Bach himself conducting on Christmas Day, 1734, in Leipzig's St. Thomas Church. The other cantatas were heard on the second and third days after Christmas, New Year's Day and the Feast of Epiphany. Composed as a collection of six cantatas, rather than following a single biblical text as most oratorios do, the work is woven together by recitations.   Soloists in Saturday's performance are Susanne Peck, soprano; Ray Pellerin, countertenor; Patrick Romano and Thom Baker, tenors, and John Eppler, bass.   \"Hallelujah Holidays,\" a family Christmas-Hanukkah-Kwanzaa spectacular by the New Orchestra of Westchester will be performed in the Performing Arts Center Concert Hall at the State University of New York at Purchase. It begins with excerpts from \"The Nutcracker Suite\" by Tchaikovsky, Bach's \"Brandenburg\" Concerto No. 2, with Paul Dunkel, the orchestra's director, doubling as flute soloist, and Robert Fertitta manning the Flentrop organ.   Next on the bill is a mini-version of Dickens's \"Christmas Carol,\" presented by the Phoenix Theater. Miller Lide will serve as narrator; Vernon Morris will portray Scrooge, and Bram Lewis, the theater's artistic director, will be Bob Cratchit. Projections of George Cruikshank's original drawings for the novel will provide backdrops for the costumed actors.   Robert Sherman of WQXR will then narrate \"G.A.G.E. -- The Story of Silent Night,\" accompanied by the orchestra. The letters are the first four notes of the beloved carol.   In addition, a rousing chorus of more than 200 voices from the Westchester Choral Society, the Master Singers of Westchester and the Dobbs Ferry Harmonaires Children's Chorus, with Diana Solomon-Glover, soprano, and Andre Solomon-Glover, baritone, will join in songs from the Caribbean, familiar carols and excerpts from Handel's \"Judas Maccabaeus\" and \"Messiah.\"   The third concert is Westchester Community College's \"Too Hot to Handel,\" a version of the composer's \"Messiah\" featuring rock, rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel and pop. It will have its premiere in Lincoln Center on Thursday and will be performed at the County Center in White Plains on Saturday by the college's Concordia Orchestra, the Morgan State University Choir from Baltimore and Lillias White, soprano; Vivian Cherry, mezzo-soprano, and Thomas Young, tenor. The conductor will be Marin Alsop, the first woman to win the Koussevitsky Conducting Prize and consequently, in 1990, the first woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

Annie's Shells and Cheddar is unusual in the macaroni and cheese market because it uses natural white Cheddar as a base for its cheese sauce, without adding preservatives.

For example, Jim O'Neal exhumes a stereotype when he writes: \"White performers could play the music, sing the lyrics and express personal emotions within a blues framework with all degrees of talent and sincerity, but only those born to the blues culture could deliver the blues as defined by B. B. King's 'Why I Sing the Blues.' \" As other contributors note, however, the blues has served as an \"incestuous\" musical relationship between the races since its beginnings. \"Nothing but the Blues,\" edited by Lawrence Cohn, who compiled the Grammy-winning \"Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings,\" also shows that even the so-called experts cannot agree on what the genre is or where it began. However, besides the photographs, and the inspiring design by Molly Shields, chapters by Mark A. Humphrey and Charles Wolfe are insightful contributions to the scholarship on the blues. Still, some evident prejudices by some of the essayists rankle. The essays by Samuel Charters and David Evans give off the moldy whiff of academia. And Mary Katherine Aldin, writing about \"the blues today,\" manages to give but a single reference to Stevie Ray Vaughan.

To find and photograph white wolves on the open green tundra of Ellesmere Island in the Arctic is one thing, but to do the same with dark wolves in the dark forests of northern Minnesota is quite another. Furthermore, the wolves of Ellesmere were unfamiliar with people and hence were not as wary as are timber wolves everywhere, which are persecuted and avoid us. Because of the elusiveness of his subjects, Mr. Brandenburg did some photography in a facility where the animals are studied. But wolves are no less wolfish in captivity, and the shots of them, along with the photographs of wild wolves, of the landscape and of other animals, make \"Brother Wolf\" a spectacular success.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"How to Play Chopin?

Knowing the pitfalls can help choose materials and techniques.   Almost any flooring can be installed over concrete. Resilient flooring -- sheet vinyl or vinyl tiles -- is a popular and inexpensive choice, but wood flooring and carpet are also possibilities. Stone, clay or ceramic tiles generally lack necessary warmth, both in appearance and underfoot, for most installations. But do not write them off as choices in half-basements receiving ample light from patio doors or large windows.   Before making a selection, test the moisture content of the concrete floor and consider the preparations needed for various materials. Choose three to six spots about two feet square in different locations. At least two spots should be near corners. The others can be in open areas.   Scrub the areas with a dry brush to clean them thoroughly. Cut pieces of plastic sheeting, kitchen wrap or aluminum foil and place them over the cleaned areas, sealing their edges with duct tape.   Remove the tape and check the undersides after 24 hours. If the plastic appears foggy or wet, the floor is too wet for installing any finish flooring.   On a new basement floor, waiting up to two months for the concrete to fully cure may eliminate the moisture problem. On older floors, the foundation may require more effective drainage, which is usually a job for a waterproofing contractor.   Test the floor for evenness. A floor does not have to be level to accept finish flooring, but the surface has to be flat, without bumps or hollows greater than an eighth of an inch in height or depth.   To check for those, place a long straight-edged board on the floor in as many different places and at as many different angles as practical. A board that rocks back and forth indicates a bump. Light beneath the edge of the board indicates a hollow.   Small bumps can sometimes be chiseled away. More often, though, flattening involves filling the low spots with a liquid or paste compound, which is spread with a flat trowel called a float and hardens like cement.   If a concrete floor is dry and flat, any type of flooring except hardwood planks or strips that require nailing can be directly installed.  Resilient flooring, cushion-backed carpet, parquet and wood-laminated flooring are installed with adhesive. Stone, clay and most ceramic tiles are installed by embedding in mortar. Ceramic tiles can also be installed with adhesive.   For insurance against moisture in cases where a basement slab may not have been poured over a vapor barrier of polyethylene -- standard practice at least since the 60's -- such sheeting or an equivalent material should be applied to the surface of the concrete beneath or between layers of flooring adhesive or beneath mortar.   To further flatten a floor, to protect large areas of leveling compound and to permit nailing solid wood-strip or plank flooring, a plywood underlayment is needed. For flooring fastened with adhesive, a single layer of half- or three-quarter-inch-thick plywood is adequate. Where a nailing surface is required, two layers of three-quarter-inch are best.   Use ACX-grade plywood, which has one good face and is rated for exterior use. Do not use particleboard or another manufactured-wood product. They do not hold fasteners well and are easily damaged by water.   On dry floors protected by a vapor barrier beneath the slab, underlayment panels can be fastened directly to the concrete with masonry nails, concrete screws or hammer-activated gunpowder-driven fasteners. Afterward, adhesive can be applied on top or solid wood flooring can be nailed directly to it.   Where a vapor barrier is needed above the slab, there are three ways to proceed. One is to spread a layer of asphalt mastic over the floor with a trowel, allow it to harden and then cover the mastic with overlapping sheets of polyethylene film. On top of that can be placed plywood underlayment panels, fastened by the methods described above.   A second way is to cut underlayment panels into manageable 4 X 4-foot pieces, saw or rout grooves in a grid pattern on their backs and then press them into a bed of mastic applied to the slab. No fasteners are necessary.    The third way, and the most common when installing solid wood flooring or when major flattening is needed, is to bed four-foot lengths of nominal one- or two-inch-thick preservative-treated lumber on the slab with mastic.    The boards, called sleepers, are placed with their wide surfaces against the slab and their ends overlapping by at least four inches. Hollows underneath are filled by adding shims. If desired, closed-cell foam insulation board can be placed between the sleepers for a warmer floor and to deaden footfalls.    Polyethylene sheeting is spread on top of the sleepers and fastened with staples. Solid wood flooring can be nailed directly above the plastic, with nails spaced to enter the sleepers. For flooring requiring full support, first attach plywood underlayment panels.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"800 Teddy Bears and Still Collecting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/nyregion/800-teddy-bears-and-still-collecting.html","abstract":"SCARLETT O'BEARA, Alice in Wonderbear Land, Dr. Killbear, the Vanderbear family: these are just a few of 500 teddy bears that decorate Doris Wagner's every nook and cranny this holiday season, making dusting almost impossible.\n\nTeddies swing from every twig on her Christmas tree and crowd every tabletop, all the cabinets, furniture and staircases.

Yaritza Almedina, 10, ran her fingers along her long pink skirt, delighting in the feel of the fabric. The teacher, Barbara Romero, pulled the string at the waistband as tight as it would go, then turned and helped other girls slip flamenco skirts over their jeans and leggings. She had tucked a pile of the skirts, her own costumes, in her dance bag so her students would have the chance to feel the flow of a pretty skirt as it caught the wind while they danced.\n\nAt the back of the stage, Yaritza began twirling, letting the borrowed skirt flutter as she moved. \"I would like to be a dance teacher when I grow up,\" she said. \"I like to do ballet and dance salsa.\"\n\nYaritza is one of two dozen girls and a handful of boys who are a month into their dance class at Munoz Marin. They are a fraction of the hundreds of students who will ultimately take part in the Connecticut Ballet Theater's Dance Exposure Project, a joint effort of the Southport-based Ballet Theater, the Bridgeport school system and Bridgeport area businesses and community service organizations.\n\nThe goal is to give elementary school students throughout the city a taste of dance, through in-school and after-school classes and through a performance tour by the company of the Connecticut Ballet Theater. Scholarships to the Ballet Theater school in Southport will be offered to promising students.\n\n\"Dance equals culture and it keeps culture alive,\" said the director of the Ballet Theater, Brett Raphael. \"There are 40 languages alone spoken in Bridgeport and dance is a way children can relate on a nonverbal level. It's also a self-esteem builder and if we can interest children who are at-risk early on, we can keep them interested right on up the ladder.\"\nThe Call of the Castanets\n\n The students, who spend an hour each week learning flamenco dance, are an eager, boisterous group. Ms. Romero, a professional flamenco dancer and dance instructor, drives in from Manhattan to teach the class. \n\nAt the start of a recent class, she clacked her castanets and within moments the lines of dancers dissolved, all of them eager to try out the instrument. She gave a quick lesson, slipping into and out of Spanish for the bilingual students. She then tried to corral the group back to some semblance of order and taught a few steps. They danced in a small space, just a curtain's pull away from basketball practice in the adjacent gym as music wafted from a cassette player.\n\n\"I enjoy teaching this class very much,\" Ms. Romero said. \"All kids need culture and dance and I like bringing it to them. It's a lot different from teaching a class in a studio and in that way it's much more of a challenge, but I really like it.\"\n\nAs a group of girls practiced swishing their skirts and clapping their hands, admiring each other's moves, the boys said they liked the stomping. \n\n\"You get to stamp your feet loud,\" Carlos Serrano, 10, said. \n\nHis brother, Anthony, 8, decked out in a string tie, stood next to him, raising his arms overhead in a flourish as he strove to learn Ms. Romero's steps. \n'An Exciting Place'\n\n Carlos said his parents liked to turn the radio up on the weekends and dance to Spanish music. \"We all love to dance,\" he said, adding that he had taken dance classes before at a local boys' club. \"I like coming here after school. My Mom works, so at home there'd be nothing for us to do after school except watch TV.\" \n\nThe dance class is just one element of an after-school program for Munoz Marin students sponsored by the McGivney Community Center, which runs youth programs for the neighborhood. \n\n\"These kids have an exciting place to be after school, a vital, interesting, safe place, and the dance program is just another part of the education,\" said Anthony F. Forni, the center's president. \n\nSusan McDonald, a teacher at Munoz Marin and the coordinator of the after-school program, said she had seen children improve in school after having become involved in the dance program.\n\n\"You see it on their faces as they dance,\" she said. \"They're so happy and they're so proud. What a wonderful thing that is. And it translates into success in the classroom because they feel that way about themselves.\" \n\nThe school's principal, Milagros Vizcarrondo, said the dance program taught self-discipline and gave students hope for the future.\n\n\"Not every child is going to succeed at math or reading but he may be an artist,\" she said. \"We live in a very economically and socially depressed area and this is not something parents can afford to do on their own for their children.\"\nCultural Development Is Goal\n\n Last year, the Connecticut Ballet Theater created a pilot program in four Bridgeport elementary schools, offering classes in flamenco, African and jazz dance as part of the school curriculum. It has expanded the program to include after-school programs sponsored by several community centers. Corporations and foundations like the Chase Manhattan Bank, the General Electric Foundation, the Bridgeport Futures Initiative and the Fairfield County Community Foundation are providing financial support.\n\nBrenda Smith, the president of the Bridgeport Futures Initiative, said one of the organization's goals was to provide children with as much cultural development as possible.\n\n\"Studies have shown that children who engage in artistic as well as cognitive programs when they are young do much better as adults,\" she said. \"It's important for children in the inner city, for children in the suburbs and in rural areas as well. They need that opportunity for self-expression.\"\n\nThe coordinator of the Dance Exposure Project and teacher of modern dance with the Connecticut Ballet Theater, Claire Mastromonaco, said that was why the dance theater had created the program. The Ballet Theater started a program in Stamford in 1991 and some of the students there went on to perform in the Ballet Theater's production of \"The Nutcracker.\"\n'A Fundamental Element'\n\n \"Bridgeport has so many resources,\" Ms. Mastromonaco said. \"The teachers in the schools, the people in the community want so much for their children, I've really seen that through this dance program. It just needs to be more united to get things done and I think that is happening here. The arts are a fundamental element to life and I think people are starting to see that. \n\n\"We've seen it in the kids,\" she said. \"The teachers say their energy level is more even during the school day. Learning to read and do math is so important, but through the arts you get to know yourself.\"\n\nAs the end of the class at Munoz Marin neared, Yaritza showed a series of steps to her younger sister, Marie, 8. \"This way,\" she said, with confidence. Her sister then followed her steps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"James the Ripper?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/books/james-the-ripper.html","abstract":"  THE DIARY OF JACK THE RIPPER Narrative by Shirley Harrison.

Fair sites, in fact, exist as a species of public theater set, where local, national and international dramas play to paying audiences. At the end of the run, the set is struck, save for a few monuments built for permanence, like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the St. Louis Art Museum, and the New York City Building of the 1939 fair, a building in Flushing that later served a stint as a skating rink.  Fortunately, photography was on hand to extend the life of these performances.

But after I moved to Tucson a couple of years ago, I found myself lying in bed, wide awake at 6 A.M., amazed by the incredible array of birds screeching outside my house. I wondered if I wanted to know their names or merely to shoot them so I could go back to sleep.\n\nThese days, my bird-watching skills are still meager. (I prefer the old-fashioned term bird watching to the yuppier \"birding.\" Let's face it, anything you have to get up at 5 A.M. to do is a nerd activity.) Nevertheless, thanks to a course at a local community college and an ornithologist friend named Chris, I've spotted many of the southern Arizona birds tourists fly thousands of miles to see and add to their life lists. Gaps do remain, however. A few months ago, I lost patience with people asking me if I had seen the elegant trogon (Trogon elegans), which can be found in only four places in the United States. To me it was more like the rare invisible trogon, since I had failed to see it, despite repeated visits to one of its major nesting sites.

For the last five years, Orlando Cepeda has been working in community relations for his old team, the San Francisco Giants. It would be easy to sneer that Cepeda is paid to visit the cancer wards and the drug clinics and the youth groups, but we have all seen athletes who are paid to meet the public yet make everybody uncomfortable with their selfishness. By all accounts, Orlando Cepeda lights up a room, which is not surprising, because Cepeda was a sunny ballplayer.    Not only that, but Cepeda was also an excellent player, who played 17 seasons, many of them with a ruined knee, batted .297, hit 379 home runs and drove in 1,365 runs. The Baseball Writers Association of America should vote Orlando Cepeda into the Hall of Fame this month, on merit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"Gift Books: To Hell and Back; Down There","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/books/gift-books-to-hell-and-back-down-there.html","abstract":"  This book is a hell of a bargain. Not only does one get for the price of an extra-large novel more than two score color reproductions of gruesome pictures of the underworld (and more than 40 pages of black-and-white plates) in THE HISTORY OF HELL (Harcourt Brace, $29.95), one also receives an insightful and balanced popular history of the growth and, one might almost say, the flowering of imagination about that place at the entrance of which all hope is abandoned.   As Alice K. Turner, the fiction editor at Playboy, notes, human creativity has been much more fascinated by hell than by heaven, for heaven is clearly a metaphor that attempts to hint at the ineffable, while hell is \"oddly fleshly, with tortures that hurt and an atmosphere that is . . . excessively gross.\" Moreover, as Ms. Turner notes, hell has what Hollywood might call an \"entertainment quotient,\" even in some imaginative work a comic dimension. For these reasons it is no exaggeration to claim, as Ms. Turner does, that \"hell is the largest shared construction project in imaginative history,\" the work of geniuses from Homer to Blake and including St. Augustine, Michelangelo and Hieronymus Bosch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"Raffle Planned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/sports/sports-people-hockey-raffle-planned.html","abstract":"  Taking the lead in a Long Island-wide effort to raise funds for victims of the Dec. 7 Long Island Rail Road shooting, the Islanders will contribute $1 from every ticket sold for the Dec. 17 game against Toronto to the L.I.R.R.

The band's decision to include the song \"Look at Your Game, Girl\" -- recorded by Mr. Manson in the late 1960's when he was trying to launch a folk-rock career -- means the jailed cult leader could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Manson is serving a life sentence in California for his part in the 1969 murders of the actress Sharon Tate and six other people.

(Knopf, $45.) More than 700 lyrics displaying the fresh and inventive rhymes, supple phrasing, intelligence and wit that made Gershwin a lyricist nobody can read for one minute without humming. THE DUKE ELLINGTON READER, edited by Mark Tucker. (Oxford University, $30.) A fascinating anthology of 70 years' worth of writing about (and occasionally by) Ellington, who clearly inspired powerful emotions in even the most sober minds. EXIT INTO HISTORY: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe, by Eva Hoffman. (Viking, $23.) Seeking out the ordinary, a Polish-born writer with a touch of American objectivity makes a tour of Mitteleuropa, returning with subtle insights about a world in transition. EXTRA INNINGS: A Memoir, by Doris Grumbach. (Norton, $22.) Well into her 70's, Ms. Grumbach says she is trying to \"learn to sit still\" and mining what she calls her \"mental compost heap.\" GENET: A Biography, by Edmund White. (Knopf, $35.)

GHOSTS, by John Banville. (Knopf, $21.) Rattling around in this Irish writer's witty, startling and nearly plotless novel are echoes of \"The Tempest,\" entrancing visual elements, an obscure and intricate mystery, violence and a houseful of threatening oddballs. A HISTORY OF WARFARE, by John Keegan. (Knopf, $27.50.) Mr. Keegan, the most readable and original of military historians, argues that war is an omnipresent cultural ritual of mankind, from which the ruthless modern notion of disciplined total war was an aberration.

Miller got another lesson in this particular brand of frustration when he and the Pacers visited Madison Square Garden last night.

Johnny, on the other hand, would appreciate its buzz and no doubt contribute to it. The Pollo Bar is the kind of hangout where one could lapse into werewolf howls of rage, as Johnny does early in \"Naked,\" and virtually be ignored in the crush of other Londoners, wayward or otherwise, who -- for the moment anyway -- have found a home.   That desire for home permeates \"Naked,\" a picaresque chronicle of spiritual homelessness whose cast also includes such rising British actresses as Lesley Sharp and Claire Skinner, playing two London roommates with whom Johnny seeks refuge. At Cannes this year, the film, Mr. Leigh's first feature since \"Life Is Sweet\" in 1990, won awards for best director and best actor and went on to acclaim in October at the New York Film Festival.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"Holiday Meals That Come With Merriment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/nyregion/dining-out-holiday-meals-that-come-with-merriment.html","abstract":"  Not all holiday galas are pegged to hearth and home.

Weisman Museum of Art, designed by Frank Gehry for the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, may remind you of the first time you saw mercury. You were a child, learning to differentiate between one thing and another, and along came this stuff that threw the whole idea of differentiation into doubt. Is it metal? Water? Magic? An adult version of Silly Putty? How come it neither hardens nor flows? Do you call it a piece or a puddle? Call it a lesson: the mind must make room for a world where things will not always fall neatly into place.   The mercurial quality of the Weisman Museum, which opened three weeks ago, isn't solely due to the quicksilver reflections of light that constantly play over its gleaming stainless steel facade. Nor is it just a matter of the mutable images -- a fish, an ice palace, Rapunzel's tower -- fleetingly evoked by the facade's flaring, curving facets. It arises, rather, from an idea about art and its place in the contemporary scheme of things. This is Frank Gehry's first art museum. He has designed some brilliant museum installations over the years, and his Temporary Contemporary, a converted industrial shed, remains one of downtown Los Angeles's enduring joys. But the Weisman is the first art museum Gehry has designed from the ground up, and it invites a closer view of the kinship between art and architecture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"Commercial Property/Rockefeller Center; Surmounting the Hump of Lease Expirations","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/realestate/commercial-property-rockefeller-center-surmounting-the-hump-of-lease-expirations.html","abstract":"  A YEAR or two ago, people seemed ready to sound a death knell for Rockefeller Center.

The student, who was promptly arrested, said later that he was trying to scare off a group of teen-agers from another school who had come to beat him up.\n\nAs a result of that incident, the youth officer for the town's police department, Kelly Fogg, now patrols the halls of the suburban high school near the waterfront villages of Mystic and Groton Long Point, where some of its students live. And while Fitch also draws students from more urban sections of Groton, no one at the school expected to worry about gunfire or the need for police protection.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"Waterfront Vision","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/arts/l-new-york-s-future-waterfront-vision-021793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   We write in response to Herbert Muschamp's essay \"Fear, Hope and the Changing of the Guard\"  [ Nov. 14 ] .

His pedestal in Lub yanka Square is adorned now by a simple wood cross.   Once you could set your watch by the honor guard that goose-stepped to Lenin's tomb on the hour. The ritual has been canceled. And what about all those statues and other monuments paying public homage to Lenin and his Bolshevik cronies? They are vanishing even as the onion domes are being repainted on the old churches once closed under the Communists. Moscow's streets, whose names evoked a pantheon of Soviet heroes, have reverted to names that predate, and puzzle, the city's current inhabitants. But my favorite landmark has been left virtually untouched, and it's still affordable.

The original drugs had many unpleasant side effects, from dizziness and painful dry mouth to weight gain and sluggishness. Doctors, too, were uneasy about the potency of the pills, and thus prescribed the medications for short courses, up to nine months maximum.   Many doctors say they are comfortable keeping their patients on the newer antidepressants for long stretches. They say the drugs are safer than the older generation of pills, are almost impossible to overdose on, have fewer side effects and work wonderfully for patients who were difficult to treat before, including those who suffer from panic disorders, anxiety attacks, bulimia, anorexia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.    Yet the medical portrait of Prozac and related compounds emerging from years of use among millions of patients is not a simple sunburst of unfettered success. The drugs bear their own disturbing consequences and question marks, particularly in their long-term risks. Some doctors worry that, with all the pep talk surrounding the novel antidepressants, the trouble spots are being ignored and the pills being presented as the pharmacological equivalent of a Snackwell fat-free cookie: a chance at bliss without paying the price. 'Deceptively Easy'    \"Drugs like Prozac are so deceptively easy to take and tolerate that they can excuse a physician from respecting the complexity of depression,\" said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.    But that has not stopped some patients. Rebecca L. Morgan of Monaca, Pa., has been on Prozac for three years, since she was 27, and she has no intention of quitting, ever. The drug is the flagship member of a new fleet of antidepressants, and it has transformed her life. Before Prozac, she could not keep a job for more than a few months at a time. For the past year and a half, she has been a counselor for the mental health association in Beaver County. Before Prozac, she suffered five episodes of major depression, during which she could hardly drag herself off her couch or feel enough to realize she was miserable. Now, she still has emotional peaks and troughs, but when she is faced with an adverse event, she does not slide into a depression as she says she would have in the past.    \"I don't know what the long-term effects of the drug are,\" she said, \"but if 20 years from now they say it affects the kidneys or the lungs or whatever, I'm willing to pay the price. Prozac helps me now.\"   Ms. Morgan is not alone in embracing Prozac as a permanent therapy for the chronic problem that is her melancholic nature. Since Prozac was introduced five years ago, its popularity has soared to tropospheric heights. More than 10 million people have taken the drug worldwide, earning for its maker, Eli Lilly & Company, about $1 billion a year. Many other people are using even newer, chemically related drugs called by the trade names Paxil and Zoloft. And while most remain on the medications for less than a year, a sizable minority are staying on the drugs for two years or longer.  Drugs Are Specific    Much of the relative safety of the new class of drugs, called serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, lies in their biochemical specificity. The original antidepressants, introduced in the 1950's and known as the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, jiggle multiple biochemical pathways in the brain and reconfigure the balance of several different types of signaling molecules, or neurotransmitters. By comparison, Prozac and its cousins zero in on one neurotransmitter, serotonin, brightening mood and lessening anxiety by keeping pools of the chemical available in the brain for nerve cells to use and reuse. Greater specificity in the nervous system means fewer side effects throughout the body.    Nevertheless, some researchers warned that serotonin is a muscular chemical and that manipulating it even with exquisite specificity is bound to reverberate in unexpected ways. Although early fears that Prozac may occasionally initiate violent or suicidal behavior have not been supported by extensive clinical studies, new studies show that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have a more severe impact on sexuality than at first estimated, causing symptoms like impotence, an inability to ejaculate, an inability to reach orgasm, a loss of sensation in the vagina, and an all-round loss of interest in one's erotic affairs.    \"The early studies on this suggested an incidence of about 2 percent, but that was based on self-reporting, from the patients,\" said Dr. Peter Kramer, author of the best seller \"Listening to Prozac.\" \"When researchers went out and vigorously interviewed people, they found 40 percent had some sexual dysfunction.\"    Another common side effect of the new antidepressants that had been underemphasized until recently, said Dr. Brian Doyle, director of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program, is sleep disturbances. Perhaps a third of Prozac users suffer severe insomnia, and some who manage to fall sleep report excessively vivid dreams that can verge on nightmares.   For those Prozac users in whom insomnia becomes unbearable, some doctors prescribe small doses of, oddly enough, the older tricyclic antidepressants, which can be sedating. But physicians never mix the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors; that combination can be extremely dangerous, causing rigidity, rapid fluctuations in vital signs, extreme agitation progressing to delirium, coma and even death. Drugs Fail for Some    Researchers also warned that the serotonin compounds do not work for 20 percent to 40 percent of depressed or anxious people who try them, the same failure rate seen with the older antidepressants. Some patients say they find drugs like Prozac disorienting or too amphetamine-like in their properties, causing problems in concentration and memory.    Apart from known side effects, the risks of taking any antidepressant drug for years is not yet clear, for the simple reason so far no one has taken the drug for very long. In studies with mice and pigs, Canadian investigators have found that antidepressants can act as tumor promoters, hastening the growth of nascent malignancies. These preliminary results have yet to be confirmed by others, and there is no evidence to suggest that antidepressants contribute to cancer in humans, but some researchers admit that the long-term risks remain to be gauged.    Because women suffer a disproportionate rate of depression and thus are more likely to be takers of Prozac, a few studies have looked at the effect of the antidepressants on pregnant women. So far, researchers have seen no increase in birth defects from the drugs, but women who take any sort of antidepressant drug, including Prozac, have about twice the rate of miscarriages during the first trimester of pregnancy as do women not on the medications.    Nor can researchers be sure that exposing a fetus to a drug capable of altering the balance of neuronal signaling molecules does not have a subtle impact on the brain that only shows up years later, say, as a learning disorder. In addition, a nursing mother on Prozac may transmit traces of the medication to her infant, again with unknown effects. Long-Term Treatment    The trend toward treating recurrent depression as a chronic disease, deserving of long-term, if not lifetime treatment with antidepressants, is likely to accelerate, doctors said.   \"Eighty to 90 percent of people who had one episode of depression will have another,\" said Dr. David Kupfer, a professor and chairman of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"That realization makes me much more aggressive. People need long-term treatment, and we need to figure out the best strategy.\"   But some researchers observe with concern that the drift toward extended drug regimens is occurring in parallel with another trend: prescribing antidepressants for people who are not really depressed. Prozac is now being given with some regularity to patients diagnosed as \"dysthymic,\" jargon for perpetually crabby, under the weather, insecure, malcontent.   \"Dysthymia has less of a biological feel to it\" than does full-blown depression, said Dr. Doyle of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program. \"There's not as much of the sleep disturbances or the appetite problems. These are people who realize they're more unhappy than the situation calls for, and that meditation, exercise, talking to friends just doesn't do the trick.\"   As it turns out, Dr. Doyle said, many dysthymics do very well on Prozac and its chemical siblings, finding in the drugs a brightening of mood that therapy sessions alone may have failed to bring.    But whether the syndrome is a true disease is a matter of considerable debate among doctors. And to some critics, the idea of people who are not really sick taking potent psychiatric drugs for months or years is a sobering prospect indeed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931213","headline":"MOROCCO TO WIDEN LINKS WITH ISRAEL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/13/world/morocco-to-widen-links-with-israel.html","abstract":"  King Hassan of Morocco has decided to broaden his country's economic cooperation with Israel in a major step toward the eventual normalization of relations, senior Clinton Administration officials say.
