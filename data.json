With a velvety sound that gauged the small playing space perfectly, Mr. Gampel made his New York City recital debut at the Frick Collection on Wednesday afternoon. He thrived on the Scriabin Second Sonata and Chopin's Variations on \"La ci darem la mano,\" but seemed more than a little uneasy in Schubert's Impromptus (D. 899) and the Schumann \"Faschingsschwank aus Wien.\"   When Scriabin's florid, ever-moving detail or Schubert's rhythmic left-hand accompaniments locked Mr. Gampel's melodic movement into place, the pianist became a sound interpreter. When confronted with unadorned melody, however, he seemed at a loss. The Intermezzo from the Schumann, for example, is phrased in one dramatic breath: an upward leap and downward swoop toward dissonance and resolution; Mr. Gampel draws back in mid-plunge, totally dismantling the effect. Similar interruptions undid the tensions of the earlier Romance section. Ritards, accelerations and accentuation, in other words, must sound absolutely necessary to a performance.

Where Mr. Becker and Mr. Fagen could agonize for months over perfecting a smooth transition, hip-hop has brought sudden jump-cuts instead.

My deepest fear is coming true, doctor. I like the Yankees. I actually think they can stay in the pennant race. I see them becoming more than the sum of their parts. I am intrigued by their versatility, their characters. I can't wait to see who's playing shortstop at the moment. I am having fun watching baseball.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Diner's Journal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/arts/diner-s-journal.html","abstract":"  Yes, We Have No Pasta    In Italy, a rosticceria is a combination restaurant and catering shop, with different areas for roasted meats, antipasto dishes and other prepared food, pizza and desserts.

Will the Blue Jays allow themselves to be caught? Can the American League East even be called a two-team pennant race yet? Maybe, maybe and probably not are the answers to the above questions. They are questions that will linger as the final 40 games of the season are played and the Yankees, Red Sox and maybe the Orioles continue pursuing the Jays. The second-place Yankees, who have not spent even a day alone in first place this season, could be boosted or buried by certain developments as they attempt to slice their two-game gap. Ways to Boost Yanks' Chances ABBOTT AND PEREZ   Significant contributions from Melido Perez and Jim Abbott. The excuses are growing old. Solid starts and games that could have or should have been won by these two underachievers are no longer important, only victories are. With about eight starts each left, both Perez and Abbott need to pitch supremely better than .500 for the Yankees to continue contending. They are a combined 15-21 with a 4.38 e.r.a. after both had e.r.a.'s under 2.90 last season. They need at least 10 victories in their last 16 starts to make their winter bearable. GETTING CLOSER TO A CLOSER   Rob Dibble, Rick Aguilera, Dennis Eckersley and Bryan Harvey. Those intriguing reliever names have been floated and others are likely to follow, but none are likely to float onto the Yankee roster before it is set for post-season play in 11 days. General Manager Gene Michael has been adamant about not trading away prospects so the new-look bullpen with Bob Wickman and Paul Assenmacher in prominent roles could remain intact.  DEPENDING ON DON MATTINGLY   Perhaps this is finally his year, the year when he finally plays in the post-season. Perhaps, but his robust bat cannot stop spraying hits just yet. Enjoying a 53-game splurge that has seen him hit .369 with 12 homers and 54 runs batted in, Mattingly must do more and more. Or, at least more of the same over the final 40 games. ROAD WARRIORS   Playing above .500 on the lonesome road. They have lost 16 of their last 25 on the road. They play 22 of their last 40 on the road. Figure out the statistics and the odds are not good for a stylish conclusion to their road schedule, but it is needed. Starting Monday in Chicago, the Yanks must play better than their .475 percentage and win at least 12 of their last 22 away from home. That includes a journey to Toronto on Sept. 24-26, which they hope will still be meaningful. Ways to Bury Yanks' Chances A SLUMP BY JIMMY KEY   He is the best the Yankees have. He is 15-4 with a league-best 2.83 earned run average and is fighting Jack McDowell for the Cy Young Award. But his glorious season has not been so glorious lately. Key is 3-2 with a 4.47 e.r.a. in his last six starts after surrendering 22 earned runs and 50 hits in 44 1/3 innings. For Jimmy Key, he is struggling. The Yankees need him to regain his form he displayed so consistently for much of the season. A LOSING STREAK AT HOME   The Stadium has been a haven for the Yankees. They have won 30 of their last 40 games in the Bronx and have the second finest home record in the league. That cannot change. The Yankees and Blue Jays have a somewhat similar schedule over the final six weeks, with each playing 22 of their final 40 games onthe road but New York stil has to play the A.L. West-contending White Sox, Royals and Rangers 15 times while Toronto plays the lowly A's and Angels and stumbling Mariners 19 games. OFFENSE PETERS OUT   Mike Stanley and Paul O'Neill have provided the Yankees with timely hits all season. Make that until the last two weeks. Stanley, who could end his season today with the best statistics of his professional life, has no homers, three runs batted in and a .205 average in his last 14 games. Is the grind of the season catching up with the former backup catcher? O'Neill, once second in the league in batting, is 5 for his last 31 to shrink 13 points off his average and lower it to .312. Is .300 still within reach? INJURY TO TARTABULL   Manager Buck Showalter can burn inside about Tartabull playing only one game in the outfield since July 15 because of a shoulder injury, but he should really just be thankful that Tartabull can swing a bat. If Tartabull remains healthy enough to hit, the Yankee lineup remains healthy. Do you think Mattingly's resurgence has anything to do with having Tartabull behind him? Sure it does. Since the last time Tartabull played right field, he has hit nine homers and driven in 32 runs to help the Yankees go 21-11. Ignore that Tartabull is clogging up the designated hitter slot and leave him there.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/nyregion/c-corrections-261793.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Wednesday about Thomas B.

The second group performed on Thursday night: Michael Hayes as the itinerant Prince, Laura Claycomb as his spring fling Kathie, and Robert Perry as the doomed Dr. Engel. All three young singers were making their City Opera debuts; given the particular demands of the Romberg manner, it's hard to pass judgment on their general operatic skills, but two of them showed promise.   Mr. Hayes had a confident and accurate tenor, wooden at times but thoroughly idiomatic. His acting was hardly less impressive; alongside his three Heidelberg buddies (of whom Gordon Gietz's Detlef deserves to be singled out), he artfully conveyed the obnoxious collegiate drunkenness crucial to Act II. Ms. Claycomb, a soprano, did not do quite as well, struggling with the high notes and making her character seem strangely feckless. She missed the rousing, buoyant spirit appropriate to a number like \"Come Boys, Let's All Be Gay Boys.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"1943: Fortresses Attack : IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/opinion/IHT-1943-fortresses-attack-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] American Flying Fortresses flew through heavy weather and bitter fighter opposition to attack German airdromes at Flushing and Gilze-Rijen, in Holland, yesterday [Aug. 19], following a day-long assault by lighter Alli","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Review/Film; A Feminist Cross-Dresser in the Old West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/movies/review-film-a-feminist-cross-dresser-in-the-old-west.html","abstract":"Female cross-dresser in Old West.

Although many of its characters are Jews caged in the Czechoslovak ghetto city of Theresienstadt and face imminent deportation to death camps, you wouldn't know it from the way they talk. Musing on their fate, they adopt the sorrowful-to-sardonic tone of Chekhov aristocrats lamenting the boorishness of modern life. Everybody in the movie, including the Nazis, speaks in an impeccable \"Masterpiece Theater\"-style English that rarely rises above the volume of drawing-room conversation.   The mood of calm despair that hangs over the film lends it a disquietingly surreal aura. But it also plays into the story, which describes an attempt to deliver a horrifying message without stating it in words.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Review/Theater; A New Traveler Makes a Classic Journey Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/theater/review-theater-a-new-traveler-makes-a-classic-journey-home.html","abstract":"  It is slightly disconcerting to realize that Ellen Burstyn is now playing old ladies. Like most people who achieved their broadest fame in movies, she seems frozen in memory at the point when that fame was greatest, and one still thinks of her poised resiliently on the cusp of middle age, as she was in her Oscar-winning performance in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" nearly 20 years ago. Still, if Mick Jagger can go ahead and turn 50, why shouldn't Ms. Burstyn -- who has publicly sworn she will do one play a year, come what may -- be allowed to play Alfred Uhry's Miss Daisy, as she did in Chicago five years ago, or Carrie Watts, the slyly willful old woman in Horton Foote's \"Trip to Bountiful\"?   The latter has been revived in a cleanly staged, sincere-minded production that began life at Theaterfest in Upper Montclair, N.J., and has now been brought by the Phoenix Theater Company to its Performing Arts Center on the State University campus here.

But \"Multiple Images: Photographs Since 1965 From the Collection,\" the ambitious show now at the Museum of Modern Art, demonstrates that in recent years artists have worked eagerly and effectively to undermine that assumption.   \"Multiple Images\" shows how pervasive the idea of including more than one image in a single work has become. The show, the first organized by Sheryl Conkelton, the museum's new associate curator of photography, includes work by Jan Groover, Andy Warhol, Robert Cumming, Richard Avedon and many other artists. Judging from the works on view, perhaps the most frequent use photographers have made of multiple images has been to create what are in effect mini-movies, sequences of images that describe an event not in a single glimpse but as a series of moments. Some of these works are explicitly narrative, using dramatic staging and lighting that suggest conventions of Hollywood genre films.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Israel Drops the Veil","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/opinion/israel-drops-the-veil.html","abstract":"  There will be something startlingly different, in form if not substance, when the stalemated Mideast peace talks resume in Washington at the end of the month.

Mr. Rabin says Israel is meeting with individuals, not an organization, but all parties recognize this as a significant change.   There's still a big gap between Israeli and Arab bargaining positions, and Secretary of State Christopher's recent trip to the region didn't do much to narrow it. Yesterday's bloody exchanges with Party of God guerrillas in Lebanon didn't help either.

The contract was headed for defeat on any lead, barring the implausible diamond king.

Even with the pound devalued, cashmere sweaters are still stunningly expensive, and a skirt-length of Harris tweed or Scotch tartan might, for a cost-conscious tourist, involve giving up a long-awaited tea at the Dorchester. (And who do you know who wants a tartan skirt?) Most of the fairly inexpensive trinkets at street stands -- little soldiers in tall fur hats, miniature British flags, dish towels depicting the Tower of London, smart-alecky T-shirts -- are either flimsy or tacky, or both. So what can a traveler on a limited budget find?   Plenty -- not behind the quaint pseudo-Tudor storefront of Liberty's, but in mundane, well-stocked supermarkets such as Sainsbury, Safeway, Gateway, Tesco, Wait rose or Asda. Although London and country towns still abound in small shops, the fruiterer, butcher and baker are hard-pressed by American-style chains, some so ambitious they even include hardware sections, fast-food counters and children's play areas. Inside these emporiums of food and drink, and even in some smaller grocery stores, a souvenir hunter can quickly fill a cart with distinctive reminders of England that cost only a few dollars or less. Since many American supermarkets (and specialty shops in metropolitan areas) carry selected English imports -- After Eight mints, for example, Carr's Water Biscuits, Twining's Earl Grey tea, or Baxter's Orange Marmalade -- I avoid such obvious choices. Many other possibilities await, however, including less ordinary variations on familiar themes: Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade (orange, lemon and grapefruit, $1.70, or Hovis Butter Puffs, 75 cents, or Mint Humbugs, $1, calculated at $1.44 to the pound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"SAUDI STABILITY HIT BY HEAVY SPENDING OVER LAST DECADE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/world/saudi-stability-hit-by-heavy-spending-over-last-decade.html","abstract":"  Saudi Arabia, long seen as one of the world's wealthiest countries, has undermined its financial stability with a decade of unrestrained spending, huge military purchases and irregular banking practices.

To many in photography today, this breezy phrase is better known than the book itself, or even Renger-Patzsch's sharp-focus, geometrical images.    The catalogue for the survey of Renger-Patzsch's work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (through Sept. 26) points out that the book was given this title by its publisher, Kurt Wolff; Renger-Patzsch himself wanted to call it simply \"Die Dinge\" (\"Things\"). For him, photography was a way of recreating the order of things through the order of the photograph. His pictures of factories, mines, architecture, even flowers and animals, have an unwavering precision that is almost painful in its purity, like the obsessions of a saint.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"In the Region: Long Island;\nThe High-End Market Is Coming to Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/realestate/in-the-region-long-island-the-highend-market-is-coming-to-life.html","abstract":"THE 27-acre tract that Angelo and Silvio Pironi are developing in Woodbury is a throwback to another era.

Certainly, many places here have more grace, more age, more harmony than the Palace of Topkapi and its mesh of pavilions and styles.    But there is no single site that has as much to tell us about the values, tastes and aspirations of the Ottoman Empire, which kept its headquarters here for 400 of its more than 600-year reign. The Saray was more than the residence of the reigning Sultan and his court -- his women and slaves, grand viziers and eunuchs, teachers and executioners. This was the center of power. Taxes and tributes poured into Topkapi from an empire that extended from Ethiopia to Central Asia and to Bosnia. Records were kept here, heads rolled here and orders were carried far and wide.

This is not a biography of Austen, Nigel Nicolson explains, but an attempt to help us see the world that she saw. Nonetheless, Mr. Nicolson, who is best known as the biographer of his parents, Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, presents an engaging introduction to Austen's life, as well as a portrait of the architectural styles and taste of the age, engagingly illustrated by Stephen Colover's photographs. Moreover, in guiding us through the houses, estates and landscapes that Austen knew in Kent, Hampshire, Bath and a variety of seaside resorts, Mr. Nicolson succeeds in his purpose of considering her novels \"as a product of her experience.\" Austen (1775-1817) was the daughter of a parson of modest means who nonetheless had frequent social contacts with families on all levels of the social scale, including the nobility. Mr. Nicolson chronicles the Austen family's moves from one part of the country to another, along with Jane's frequent visits to nearby friends and relatives, and describes the ways in which her novels and letters reveal her preference for country over urban life and classical architectural styles over the ornate and romantic. Wisely, he refrains from claiming specific homes as models for any of the fictional residences in Austen's novels, pointing out that they were composites of her imagination's making. Mr. Nicolson, who lives in Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, displays a keen critical eye for architecture and design and a respectful appreciation for Austen's art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Frequent Flier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/l-frequent-flier-306493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Adam Bryant's \"Frequent Flying for Dilettantes\" (Aug. 1) discusses some strategies for accumulating credit in frequent flier programs, but fails to point out what a waste of time the entire procedure can be.

Bjork's ethereal voice and elf-girl image had critics and fans bewitched. Rave reviews predicted imminent world conquest for the Icelandic band. But it didn't happen, and the Sugarcubes never quite scaled the heights of their debut again. Over three albums, the group veered from moderately captivating dream pop to quirky, negligible new wave and gradually whittled down its cult following rather than expanding it.   Now Bjork (who doesn't use her last name, Gutmundsdottir) has gone solo, as some devotees always felt she should. In recent interviews, the 27-year-old singer has professed that she never much cared for the alternative-rock qualities of the Sugarcubes' music. With \"Debut\" (Elektra, 9 61468-2; CD and cassette), she set out to combine her love of jazz with her ardor for rave music. To this end, she hooked up with Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul, who produced most of the album and co-wrote five of the 11 songs. Mr. Hooper's rhythmic expertise provides the kind of groovy settings Bjork's voice has always deserved. The collaboration has proved effective; the album is rapidly climbing Billboard's pop chart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"At SUNY Purchase, 'The Trip to Bountiful'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/nyregion/theater-at-suny-purchase-the-trip-to-bountiful.html","abstract":"  NOTHING much happens in \"The Trip to Bountiful,\" only that a woman replenishes her soul.

By Cecil Brown. 222 pp. Hopewell, N.J.: The Ecco Press. $24.95.  AN ineluctable element of the African-American tradition, and indeed now a part of the American tradition, is the representative nature of autobiography. Well before the slave narratives established an \"I\" as \"we\" in the black experience, the speaker in autobiography spoke for the community in many essential ways. From Frederick Douglass to Arthur Ashe, the record of plight and travail and triumph speaks to \"our\" lives as a group, as Everyman and Everywoman, singing an infinity of riffs on the sorrow and the Gospel. As the tradition has endured, it has continued to create surprising modulations and variations on the themes of racism, struggle, womanhood and manhood.

The free concert is at 8:30 in Heckscher Park (271-8442). Also tomorrow at the Stephen Talkhouse on Main Street in Amagansett, Kris Kristofferson will give performances at 8 and 10 P.M. (267-3117).\n\nTony Bennett, backed by the Count Basie Orchestra, begins a three-day, three-performance gig Tuesday at the Westbury Music Fair. Each concert is at 8 P.M. (334-0800). Also, Tom Jones makes his annual visit to the Music Fair with shows on Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. and next Sunday at 7.\n\nOn Saturday, Michael Feinstein, the pianist-singer, will be at Planting Fields in Oyster Bay at 8 P.M., performing under the banner of the Friends of the Arts (922-0061).\n\nMike Nichols does not sing or even do comedy anymore. But the veteran director does talk, and talk he will on Tuesday at 8 P.M. when he offers a \"Master Lecture\" at the Bay Street Theater Festival in Sag Harbor (725-1108).\nTALL IN THE SADDLE\n\n With more than 150 entries competing in some 60 pleasure, hunter and equitation classes, the lineup at today's fifth annual Nassau Suffolk Horseman's Association Show is packed with potential. The traditional three-ring event is from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. at the Fairgrounds at Old Bethpage Village Restoration on Round Swamp Road (572-8400).\n\nAnother kind of competitive riding, but this time western style, will be featured Saturday, when the Long Island Horsemen's Association holds its Eastern Gymkhana Show. Attracting more than 200 horses and their riders, the event will earn the winners points toward regional titles. The show begins at 6:30 P.M. at the Suffolk County Farm and Education Center in Yaphank and will be preceded by a country-music concert by The Fugitives at 4. (852-4605).\n'CHASING SHADOWS'\n\n During her childhood, Naomi Gryn's father, Hugo, a Conservative rabbi in London, used to tell her stories about growing up in Berehovo in Carpathia, then Czechoslovakia, but later in the Soviet Union. The stories always ended with the inevitable: the Jews who made up half the town's population were shipped to the crematorium at Birkenau.\n\nNow a film maker, Ms. Gryn accompanied her father back to his hometown a few years ago. \"Chasing Shadows\" is the documentary account of that journey. Along with Rabbi Gryn's recollections, it features rare footage of Carpathian Jewish farmers, newsreels of Hungarian troops \"liberating\" Berehovo and the only known film of the selection process at Birkenau. \n\nThe movie will be shown Tuesday at 1 and 8 P.M. at the Peninsula Library on Broadway in Lawrence (239-3262).\nRECALLING 1928 BERLIN\n\n The elegant world of music and dance that flourished in Berlin, circa 1928, comes to Bellport on Wednesday, when the Gateway Playhouse presents the fifth of its six musicals this summer. This time it is \"Grand Hotel,\" the Tony Award-winning tableau set in an elite hotel.\n\nThe musical will run through Sept. 12 and will be performed at 8:30 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays, 5 and 7 P.M. on Saturdays, 2 P.M. Thursdays and next Sunday and 7 P.M. on Sundays. The Gateway is on South Country Road (286-1133).\nPLAYING SCOTTISH\n\n You do not have to be Scottish to enjoy the games scheduled for Saturday at Old Westbury Gardens. It might help, however, to have more than a fleeting knowledge of \"ye tossing of ye bar,\" or caber tossing; \"clachneart,\" or putting the stone, and \"tossing the sheaf.\" These are three of the games to be played from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.\n\nIn addition to the actual games, sponsored by the Long Island Scottish Clan, there will be music by bagpipes, some provided by the F.B.I. Irish Band; the Highland Fling and Sword Dance, performed by the Nassau Scottish Country Dancers; a demonstration of sheep dogs at work and an exhibition of historic battle swords.\n\nThe Gardens are on Old Westbury Road (333-0048).\nCELEBRATING FAMILIES\n\n Family togetherness is on tap Saturday and next Sunday at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor, at least enough togetherness to divert youngsters and their parents at the museum's annual Family Festival. \n\nBesides viewing the current exhibition, \"Long Island Collections: The Gilded Age to the 1990's\" and a juried arts and crafts show, those attending will get to visit a petting zoo, enjoy carnival and pony rides, hear live music and sample international foods.\n\nThe festival is from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. each day at the museum off Northern Boulevard. Admission is $5 a car (484-9338). \nCELEBRATING EARTH\n\n Environmentalists on the East End take their role seriously, so seriously that they have scheduled a 10-day Green Earth Festival to celebrate their successes in preserving the natural beauty and ecology of the South Fork. \n\nThe free festival, mostly at Ashawagh Hall on Fireplace Road in the Springs section of East Hampton, begins Saturday with the opening of an exhibition and sale of antique quilts and the display of the South Fork Natural History Society Quilt, designed and made by local quilters, and the start of \"Imagine Ourselves Richly,\" an ongoing art project for children and adults. The exhibitions can be seen from noon to 6 P.M. daily.\n\nThat first day also brings \"Design for a Green World,\" a panel discussion about environmentally sound architecture, at 10 A.M.; \"Thoreau and Friends,\" readings by the actors Dan Snow and Brooke Johnson, at 4 P.M., and the screening of the film \"Mindwalk\" at 9 P.M.\n\nThroughout the festival will be sessions devoted to subjects like \"Holistic Architecture\" and \"Art and the Environment: The Artist as Visionary,\" both next Sunday; walks and field trips and off-site panels on \"Forever Wild: Preserving Our Pine Barrens,\" Aug. 31 at LTV Studios in Wainscott, and \"What's Next?

If the new tenants refuse to vacate at the termination of their two-month sublease is there anything I can do short of a protracted and expensive suit? . . . Marvin Sochet, Manhattan Answer: Maybe. According to Barry Werbin, a Manhattan lawyer, if the subtenants refuse to vacate the apartment your only option may be to proceed with litigation.   Eviction, however, can be accomplished by way of a summary proceeding, which, in many cases, according to Mr. Werbin, is not terribly protracted or overwhelmingly expensive.   Mr. Werbin added that you should not take matters into your own hands by changing the locks or in any way trying to take back your apartment. If you do, he said, you may expose yourself to a lawsuit from your sub-tenants.   Even though there is no written sublease or agreement, Mr. Werbin noted that the subtenants, by virtue of their occupancy of the apartment for more than 30 days, have what is, in effect, a month-to-month lease and an oral contract. Reserve-Fund Assessment Question: My Brooklyn co-op apartment building has recently been assessed for $150,000 to build up our reserve fund, which was depleted after some capital improvements.   I know assessments for capital improvements are within the board's province, but is is legal for them to assess us just to have a larger reserve fund with no capital improvements pending? . . . Leonard J. Katz, Brooklyn Answer: Yes. According to Carl Schwartz, a Manhattan lawyer, typically, proprietary leases permit a co-op's board of directors to assess shareholders for all of the cash requirements of the corporation.   Cash requirements, Mr. Schwartz added, usually include any so-called \"cash on hand\" that the co-operative's board of directors determines to be necessary and proper. Loan on 5-Unit Building Question: My home is a unit in a five-unit building, which I own. There is no mortgage on the property at present, but it seems to be impossible to secure a home equity line of credit or a mortgage.   The only thing I have found is a very limited mortgage through the Chase Development Corporation.   Bank, credit-union and saving-institution loan officers have told me that the building can only contain four units to qualify for the home equity line of credit or a regular mortgage.   Is this true? Why is this? . . . Constancia Romilly, Manhattan Answer: Yes. According to Margaret Scott, president of the Mortgage Advisory Service, a mortgage broker in Manhattan, lenders generally won't grant home equity lines of credit or make residential mortgages on properties with more than four units.   She said that the four-units guideline has been adopted by most lenders because that is the standard set by Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, a quasi-governmental agency that is the primary buyer of mortgages in the secondary market. Incidentially, Ms. Scott noted, home equity lines of credit are, in essence, nothing more than new mortgages.   Ms. Scott also said that you would might be eligible to apply for commercial loan. This kind of loan, however, would almost always carry a higher interest rate and take longer to process.   Moreover, the income qualification will also be based on your rental income from the units, not your own income.   \"It is a major problem that I deal with,\" Ms. Scott said. \"It is too bad that more lenders won't finance five-unit houses.   \"There used to be a few lenders that used to do that,\" she added. \"But as things have tightened up, they no longer will.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Susan H.

The tours, developed by the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, are all centered around the Castle Dracula, a modern hotel, built on the edge of the Borgo Pass. Highlights include visits to historic castles and monasteries and a heavy dollop of theatricality: masked balls, twilight visits to cemeteries, and \"diplomas\" certifying participants have survived their encounter with the Count. The society also emphasizes the folklore around the Dracula legend. Tours, which range from about $300 to $1,000 a person for 4 to 15 days, including bus and plane transport from Bucharest are custom designed and may be scheduled for any time. Group size is flexible.

And more is coming. A new movie, \"Son of the Pink Panther,\" directed by the Panther veteran Blake Edwards and starring the Italian Roberto Benigni as Clouseau's illegitimate son, opens on Friday. An animated television series, \"The Pink Panther,\" has its premiere on Sept. 13.
