His main challenger, Prime Minister Milan Panic of Yugoslavia, who backs peace efforts, alleged fraud and demanded a new vote.  A1    To some, Mr. Milosevic is a knight; to others, a deluded tyrant.  A16  U.S. WARY OF ACTING IN BOSNIA    News analysis: Although Slobodan Milosevic's victory puts pressure on the West to live up to its warnings on Serbian aggression, the allies seem to have little taste for military action to stop the killing in Bosnia.  A1  SOMALI WOMEN TAKE CHARGE    Though they have suffered enormously from civil war and famine, women are redefining their role in Somalia. They monopolize trade, run relief agencies and sometimes even gain renown as looters in a country dependent on food aid.  A1    The U.N. chief insisted again that Americans disarm Somalis.  A15    Gunmen started moving menacing vehicles out of Mogadishu.  A14  MILITIA FIRES ON PALESTINIANS    About 415 Palestinians exiled in southern Lebanon tried to march back into Israeli-controlled territory but were stopped when Israel's client militia fired at them. Two were reported wounded.  A1    A look at Israel's perilous \"security zone\" in southern Lebanon.  A3  AIR CRASH KILLS 54 IN PORTUGAL    At least 54 people were dead and 4 were missing after a Dutch airliner slammed onto a runway and burst into flames in southern Portugal. But 282 survived through a mixture of luck and safety measures.  A6  RUSSIA TRODS MARKET ROAD    Despite a series of recent setbacks for President Yeltsin's drive to establish a market economy, many Western economists say and that the move toward capitalism may be too far along to be reversed.  A8  CANADA'S DOOR IS CLOSING    Long considered a model of generosity in granting asylum to the world's persecuted, Canada is tightening its immigration rules.

A1  WOMEN'S GROUPS CRITICIZED    Clinton lashed out at groups who have been complaining about the pace of appointments of women to his Cabinet as he named a utility executive, Hazel O'Leary, as Secretary of Energy and former Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina as Secretary of Education.  A1  OUTSIDER FOR ENERGY . . .    Clinton's choice of Hazel O'Leary as Energy Secretary was bound to please groups who had been looking for the inclusion of more women and blacks in his Cabinet, but it may take longer for energy companies and environmental groups to see how they feel.  B9  . . . AND REFORMER FOR EDUCATION    Richard Riley, Clinton's selection as Education Secretary, is a champion of education reform with a knack for getting the changes he wants.

The Chemical Bank ECAC Holiday Festival begins Monday at Madison Square Garden with Kentucky playing Rutgers, followed by St. John's against Manhattan. The next day, Seton Hall kicks off the first Seton Hall-Meadowlands Tournament at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena. The No. 7 Pirates play Cornell, and No. 21 California faces James Madison in the opening round. It will be the first collegiate appearance in the New York City area for the Bears' heralded freshman, Jason Kidd.   Fordham travels to Honolulu for the Rainbow Classic and Marist is off to Hilo, Hawaii, for the Big Island Invitational. Manhattan    Manhattan Coach Fran Fraschilla was as confused as his players after the Jaspers (6-1) traveled to Milwaukee to play Marquette in the Bradley Center, then went to play Bradley in Peoria, Ill., at the Target Center but stayed in the Marquette Hotel. (Traveler's advisory: Manhattan lost to Marquette, but beat Bradley.)   Besides some geography, Fraschilla learned that whatever venue the Jaspers play in, forward Keith Bullock has a good time. Bullock, who is averaging 17.8 points and 7.8 rebounds, is currently fifth in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference in both categories.   But he's not the only threat on the Jaspers, who have three other players averaging double figures. Carey Edwards (13.8), Jamal Marshall (10.3) and Brenton Birmingham (10.2) round out a balanced attack.   As for the game with St. John's in the Holiday Festival, \"it'll be a dream come true for me,\" Fraschilla said. \"I've been inside Madison Square Garden literally hundreds of times, yet this will be the first time I'm a head coach on that floor. It will definitely be special.\" Columbia    Buck Jenkins continues to climb the Lions' career-scoring list. Jenkins (19.8 points per game) is currently third on the list with a career total of 1,308 points. Jenkins is the first Columbia player to crack the school's top-five scoring list since Heyward Dotson did it in 1970. Jenkins replaced him at No. 3 but still trails Jim McMillan (1,758) and Chet Forte (1,611).   The Lions are 4-2. Their next game is Monday against Lafayette, followed by a game against Villanova in Philadelphia Dec. 30. Fordham    Fordham (2-3) will be playing in a tough tournament when it competes in the Rainbow Classic. It will have four Top 20 teams -- No. 2 Kansas, No. 5 North Carolina, No. 6 Michigan and No. 17 Nebraska -- for company, along with Hawaii, Southwest Louisiana and Jackson State.   The Rams play Hawaii Saturday in the first game, with the winner to take on the Kansas-Jackson State winner.   Siena    The Saints (2-3) are coming off a 70-58 loss to Massachusetts and a 74-70 overtime victory over Hartford. Their leading scorer, Lee Matthews, was the M.A.A.C. player of the week after shooting 60 percent from the floor and averaging 17 points and 13 rebounds. He leads the M.A.A.C. in scoring (19 points per game), rebounding (12) and field-goal percentage (65.6). Marist    It's off to the Big Island tourney in Hawaii, where the Red Foxes (3-3) play Ball State on Monday.    Junior guard Izett Buchanan is off to a solid start for the Red Foxes. Buchanan, a first-team all-Northeast Conference performer, is averaging 17 points and 8 rebounds. He was named N.E.C. player of the week after averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds in the Pepsi-Marist Classic.   But the best news for the Red Foxes was provided by senior forward Fred Ingles. Ingles, who missed all but four games last season with ankle-tendon injuries, scored 17 points in the Red Foxes' victory over Central Connecticut State. He is the team's third-leading scorer, averaging 11 points a game. Hofstra    The team without a conference gave St. John's all it could handle last Saturday, losing, 58-56, on a last-second shot by the Redmen's David Cain.   The St. John's game was the first of a five-game road trip for the Flying Dutchmen (2-5), who play 20 of their 27 games on the road this year.   Hofstra plays at Rutgers tonight, then has back-to-back road contests against No. 24 Tulane on Sunday and No. 19 U.N.L.V. on Dec. 30.   Hofstra is on the road so much because the East Coast Conference collapsed after two members, Towson State and Maryland-Baltimore County, joined the Big South, Rider went to the Northeast and Brooklyn dropped its program. Hunter    Senior forward Jose Rodriquez leads three Hawks players who are at the top of Division III statistics.   Rodriguez is first in rebounding (15.5) and Demetrius Patterson and Robert Carter are tied at No. 1 in steals, averaging five a game.   Rodriguez started the season with a 25-rebound performance against York College, the highest individual single-game total in the country thus far. He is also sixth in the nation in blocked shots (3.0). The Hawks are 2-1. Baruch    Gerald Thomas won rookie-of-the-week honors in the City University Athletic Conference for the second consecutive time. Thomas, who never played in high school, is averaging 19 points and 3 rebounds. Baruch is 5-4. York    The Cardinals' record -- 3-6 -- doesn't say much, but Mike Nicholson's performance speaks loudly.  Nicholson was named player of the week after scoring 47 points and grabbing 23 rebounds in the RIT Brodie tournament. Nicholson, a 6-5 sophomore, leads the conference in scoring with an average of 20 points per game, and in rebounding, with a 10.4 figure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19921222","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-92001926912.html","abstract":"Nothing is more crucial to the outcome of the \"Grand Design\" for the European Community than the response of its would-be members to the war in the Balkans.

Created in 1976, \"Pas de Duke\" celebrated the bicentennial, the music of Duke Ellington, and the dancing of Mikhail Baryshnikov, a guest artist, and Judith Jamison, the Ailey star. But the dance is far more than the occasion piece it first seems. Ailey created a modern-dance version of a classical pas de deux, emphasizing its buried element of sexual teasing. He also captured the sassy exuberance of Ellington's music, as well as its fleeting undertone of melancholy and its melodic lushness, in five pieces that suggest Ellington's range and, physicalized onstage, the complexity of his music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921222","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-91706266081.html","abstract":"Do we really need to know anything more about the atrocities being committed in the former Yugoslavia before action is taken?

PRISONER-SCHOLARS' REVOLUTION   A radical new approach to penology is being spawned uninvited from within the system, an approach rooted in a hard fact cited by one of a growing number of prisoner-scholars: \"More than 85 percent of prisoners in the state are black or Latino and -- most phenomenal of all -- that 75 percent of the state's entire prison population comes from just seven neighborhoods in New York City.\" A1.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Presidential Priorities; The First People to Put First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/opinion/presidential-priorities-the-first-people-to-put-first.html","abstract":"  The Bush Administration offered lofty rhetoric about children and education. But President Bush had no real track record on these issues and his legislative achievements were few.    Bill and Hillary Clinton have long been involved with children and education. And Mr. Clinton's choices of Richard Riley for Secretary of Education and Donna Shalala for Health and Human Services suggest that his administration will be marked more by action than words.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Panel Calls for Tougher Tests For Trains Carrying Poisons","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/us/panel-calls-for-tougher-tests-for-trains-carrying-poisons.html","abstract":"  The National Transportation Safety Board called today for tougher standards for the 104,000 railroad cars that transport four billion tons of hazardous material a year.   The board's recommendation for stricter testing and inspections was prompted by two cases this year in which defects in railroad tank cars led to the release of hazardous materials. There were no fatalities in either case.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Jay Leno Criticizes NBC On 'Tonight' Cliffhanger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/arts/jay-leno-criticizes-nbc-on-tonight-cliffhanger.html","abstract":"  Jay Leno, expressing what he called \"surprise and disappointment\" with NBC executives, said yesterday that he believed his performance as the host of the \"Tonight\" show should have more than satisfied the network and that he did not deserve to be threatened with losing the leading show in late-night television to David Letterman.   \"Am I crazy?\" Mr. Leno said in a telephone interview. \"The ratings are going up, the advertisers are happy and so are the affiliates.\" And yet Mr. Leno said he had not received any assurances from NBC executives in New York that he would not be dropped in favor of Mr. Letterman by Jan. 15. That is the deadline NBC is facing to match a CBS offer to give Mr. Letterman about $16 million to star in a nightly talk show at 11:30, the same time as the \"Tonight\" show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/opinion/c-correction-344392.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday misidentified the forum at which President Bush referred to demands by his questioners for more Federal spending.

But caution and competence stir no souls. If there's to be music, all now depends on the conductor. Mr. Clinton will need to define his new direction -- like the promising pro-democracy course he began to chart during the campaign.   Warren Christopher, his choice as Secretary of State, said as much yesterday, citing the global environment and global economic competition among the challenges of this new era. The appointees who will serve closest to Mr. Clinton, Anthony Lake and Samuel Berger at the National Security Council, had a large part in drafting his new direction in the campaign.

In all co-op agreements that allow heterosexual spouses to inherit apartments without being subject to the approval of the co-op board, the agreement must specifically spell out that gay couples have the same right.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Robert A.

By all accounts, Mr. Aspin's strength is his fascination with military issues. In recent years, as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, he has thought hard about the future of the Pentagon, the question of military intervention, and about how to put the weapons industry to civilian use.

If the Giants keep Ray Handley or hire someone other than Parcells, Taylor said he would have to rethink his decision.   Handley's job has been imperiled because of two disappointing seasons as Parcells's successor.

From its invasion of Angola in 1975 -- when, with covert American backing, it came within striking distance of Luanda, the capital -- to many other forays into neighboring countries, the South African military showed time and again that its forces could sweep north with relative impunity in pursuit of what its commanders termed a \"total strategy\" to mold the region to Pretoria's will.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Women Need Better Friends Than Packwood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/opinion/l-women-need-better-friends-than-packwood-347892.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Sexual Politics, the Real Thing\" (Op-Ed, Dec. 2), on charges of sexual harassment against Senator Bob Packwood, Lisa Schiffren, an aide to Vice President Quayle, shows misunderstanding of feminist causes and how personal conduct bears on a public official's record.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"Duke's Bench Has Answer for Its Critics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/sports/college-basketball-duke-s-bench-has-answer-for-its-critics.html","abstract":"  Duke 96, L.S.U. 67  LAHAINA, Hawaii, Dec. 22 (AP) -- It's tough to knock a team that is ranked No. 1 and coming off consecutive national championships.

The land donation by the International Paper Company represents a rare but major environmental breakthrough for New York, whose wilderness preservation program has been all but stymied in recent years by budget shortfalls and voter rejection of a $2 billion environmental bond act in 1990. The tract, along the Raquette River near the village of Tupper Lake, was at the top of virtually every list put together by state officials and environmentalists of areas that should be protected for future generations.

Music from the Viennese Classical period, even the early Romantic, bore the stamp of Haydn.  Earlier in this century, Arnold Schoenberg spread the 12-tone catechism throughout Europe and America. And John Cage, who himself studied briefly with Schoenberg, formed his own topsy-turvy academy in the late 1950's. He taught students and colleagues alike how to be free, and also subtly impressed upon them the importance of self-imposed systems.    On Tuesday night at the Paula Cooper Gallery, 155 Wooster Street in SoHo, the Brooklyn-based S.E.M. Ensemble brilliantly re-created the atmosphere of those years. With the aid of two original participants (Mr. Higgins and Jackson Mac Low), Petr Kotik, the director of S.E.M., followed the letter of the scores without seeming to dryly re-enact them.

But the British Government wouldn't go along and so, in the end, Mr. Bush was right to say no.    Air travel between the U.S. and Europe is swathed in restrictive agreements that prevent strong U.S. carriers from competing head to head with foreign airlines.

But the music itself cast a very strong spell. \"The Abstract and Geometric Tradition in Music and Painting, 1930-1975\" was the theme; while his visual analogies tended to be glib, Mr. Botstein succeeded in linking some of the finest American compositions of the period, tragically obscure music that makes no concession to the classical marketplace or to passing trends.
