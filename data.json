Symphonists before and after him wrote works that might be the centerpieces of concert programs but that nevertheless must share the spotlight. With a couple of exceptions -- the First and Fourth Symphonies -- Mahler's symphonies are so expansive as to require evenings to themselves. It's a good thing, because these works are as emotionally draining as they are long, and they require an involvement that would render the side dishes on the traditional concert menu irrelevant, even irritating.   What Mahler painted on these vast sonic canvases are visions of mortality and the vain struggle to defeat it. These are not visions of heaven (although in the finale of the Fourth, Mahler suggests one view of it), but of life and death in the here and now, with extremes of elation and despair transformed into musical topography. It is music that lends itself to peculiar exegeses: read enough Mahler essays and you encounter theories, advanced seriously, suggesting that Mahler's symphonies embody predictions of both world wars, racial strife and other calamities that have befallen the world since Mahler's death in 1911. It is as if the music's tragic scope is too great to be merely autobiographical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931216","headline":"CLINTON REAFFIRMS POLICY ON YELTSIN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/world/clinton-reaffirms-policy-on-yeltsin.html","abstract":"  President Clinton today played down the importance of the unexpectedly strong showing of anti-reformers in the Russian elections and said there was no need to change Washington's policy toward Moscow.

The orchestra, which performed at Zanzibar in Greenwich Village on Monday night, gets by on Mr. Roccisano's writing, which at times can be enough, especially since his arrangements are so resourceful.   The 13-member band jams high, brittle notes into a piece, creating dissonances, and Mr. Roccisano splits up the players, with the brass and reed sections talking back to each other. He has the horns use mutes or change instruments mid-song to change texture. Odd meters keep the rhythms of the band from going stale, and occasionally the rhythm section cuts out, leaving the band to play without it. Rarely does this ensemble venture into conventional territory; Mr. Roccisano has his own sound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931216","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"In his cynical treatise on Thanksgiving, William Pfaff accuses Americans of absent-mindedly celebrating a holiday that, by virtue of its \"white, Protestant, European, patriarchal origins\" is somehow unseemly, and possibly obsolete. .Perhaps M","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931216","headline":"Frenzy Is Back As Huskies Run and Gun On Their Court","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/sports/baseball-frenzy-is-back-as-huskies-run-and-gun-on-their-court.html","abstract":"  At the point of the season when roles are defined and flaws are addressed, Connecticut's Gampel Pavilion was filled with the type of frenzy that has been missing for the past several years.

Its real importance lies less in its individual provisions than in its vibrant message; the world's trading partners have now pledged to keep marching relentlessly toward liberalized trade. And that, in turn, will bring higher living standards than any other government policy will.    For the first time, agriculture, services, textiles and investment will be covered by international rules of fair trade. Tariffs and trade barriers will tumble. Those changes should drive down consumer prices on everything from clothing to computers.

Chris Ferraro wound up with two goals and Peter had one. The other American scorers were Peter Clavaglia and Darby Hendrickson.

He urged the Clinton Administration to review its policy of turning back every boat that attempts to flee Haiti. He wanted to assure that those with a legitimate claim to asylum get a fair chance to present their cases. What he got was an official rebuke.   So continues the cruel charade that has gone on since the Bush Administration started pretending that all those fleeing the terror unleashed by Haiti's September 1991 coup were economic refugees.

A show that begins with a glimpse into the cultural void of postwar Japan gives way to the queasy sensation that the West has also been swallowed up by a nuclear-age vacuum. This is a beautiful show, and it looks terrific in the great big blond galleries Mr. Isozaki has designed with James Stewart Polshek for the Brooklyn Museum's newly renovated West Wing. But a profound malaise lurks beneath the beauty.   Born in 1931 in Oita, Japan, Mr. Isozaki came of age in a country that was not only physically and economically in tatters but had also been torn from its cultural moorings. With its emperor demoted from a god to a figurehead and many of its ancient social customs outlawed by a new constitution, Japan veered toward the condition of a blank cultural slate. It is apt that the country later cornered the market in cameras, tape recorders and VCR's. With its own culture in a state of partial erasure, it is as if Japan had no choice but to fill the vacuum by recording the sights and sounds of the world beyond its borders.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Review/Art; Agleam With Devotional Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/arts/review-art-agleam-with-devotional-fire.html","abstract":"  \"Spanish Polychrome Sculpture (1500-1800) in United States Collections\" is a hidden-away gem of a show.

Surprising because many of the images gathered here seem far removed from 20th-century Western taste. This isn't art with the Neoplatonic reserve of the Italian Renaissance or with the courtly sweep of the Northern Baroque. Vivacious, minutely detailed and personal, these painted wooden sculptures have folk art in their blood and rapture and torment on their mind.

The annual tradition of holiday dancing in the halls of the Park Avenue Plaza with tea and shortbread on Saturday afternoons in December is continuing this year, with music provided by Panama Francis and the Savoy Sultans. The original Sultans were the house band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem when it was known as \"The Home of Happy Feet.\" Although never a member of the Sultans, Mr. Francis absorbed a keen knowledge of their style while he was the drummer in Lucky Millinder's band when it shared the Savoy bandstand with the Sultans in the 1940's. He revived the band in 1979 and since then it has played the rhythmic, swinging music that kept the Lindy Hoppers packing the Savoy dance floor. Tomorrow the band plays from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. and everything is free: the music is sponsored by Chartwell Booksellers and other stores in the arcade; tea is to be provided by Tetley and the shortbread by Walker's.

The newest jazz club in Greenwich Village opened this week with a group featuring the second generation of Pizzarellis, one of the best known names in jazz of the last 40 years. The guitarist John Pizzarelli follows in the footsteps of his father, Bucky Pizzarelli, who was a big-band guitarist in the 1940's and leader of notable duos and trios since then. John, who plays a custom-made seven-string guitar and also sings, is joined by his brother Martin, who plays bass, and Ray Kennedy on piano. John actually represents the third musical generation in the family -- he was taught by his banjo-playing great-uncles, Peter and Bobby Dominick, who also taught Bucky Pizzarelli. The trio plays tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M.  There is a music charge of $12 and a one-drink minimum at the tables, or a $7 music charge at the bar. J. S. W.

And as conducted by Kurt Masur, its ballet character was clear: the score is full of dances gone awry, slightly twisted waltzes, marches and fox trots, hints of popular cabaret song styles and oblique invocations of classical repertory. The piece is a distinctive original, fresh and unexpected despite its formulaic scorn for what George Bernard Shaw called \"middle-class morality.\" Its eclecticism is still being imitated and so are its themes.    The problem, though, was the packaging. It was part of a thematic program that went both too far and not far enough. Titled \"Brecht, Weill and Berlin, 1929-1935,\" and preceded by a lecture by Michael Steinberg (the San Francisco Symphony's program annotator), the program included only one work aside from the Weill: Berg's Symphonic Pieces from \"Lulu.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Puerto Ricans Are Citizens, Not Immigrants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/opinion/l-puerto-ricans-are-citizens-not-immigrants-918293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   We are pleased by your informative article about Ninfa Segarra on her appointment as deputy mayor of New York City (Woman in the News, Dec. 2), but troubled by the term \"immigrant\" to describe her lineage and family's status.   In this context, the word \"immigrant\" (one who leaves one's country to settle permanently in another) is incorrect, in that Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War under the Treaty of Paris. Furthermore, the Jones Act of 1917 granted citizenship to all Puerto Ricans, whether they are born on Puerto Rico or in the mainland United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Drug Spotlight Falls on an Unblinking Cali Cartel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/world/drug-spotlight-falls-on-an-unblinking-cali-cartel.html","abstract":"  When radio bulletins flashed the news of Pablo Escobar's death, residents of this city celebrated with caravans of horn-tooting cars.

Throughout most of its two acts it lies there on the stage of the Gershwin Theater, where it opened last night, making grandiose pronouncements on the artist's calling, looking pretty and going no place slowly.   The composer Jule Styne, the playwright Marsha Norman and her co-lyricist Bob Merrill (working under the pseudonym Paul Stryker) may once have experienced a burning desire to tell the story of Victoria Page, rising ballerina, caught between the demands of love and stardom. But months of troubled rehearsals and previews, during which the original director, the leading man and two supporting players all got their walking papers, seem to have robbed the creators of their passion.

What has changed in six years? About Mr. Freud, nothing really, except that his work has become progressively bolder and more astonishing as he has undertaken a series of mural-size nudes whose fleshiness and strange humanity have no real parallel. Appropriately, he calls these images of mostly unnamed family members, friends and associates \"naked portraits.\" They have virtually nothing to do with the idealized nudes of art history and everything to do with the swollen, lumpy, pasty reality of the human body, simulated inch by painstaking inch in paint.

Mr. Moody opened his first set on Tuesday night with a blues, and everything he knew seemed to pour out.
