The band didn't use Western instruments to imitate Western rock, but to further explore the music of its own culture. Because of this, Mr. Kina, considered the father of this hybrid Okinawan rock, has become a Bob Marley-like figure in the rest of Japan, where Okinawan music is considered exotic.    The group used a drum set, two electric guitars, a bank of synthesizers and a bass. The only visual difference between Champloose and other rock bands was the three women in bright, flowing robes who stood at the front of the stage. They sang in a nasal falsetto that set every dog in the vicinity howling, and they danced and drummed indefatigably throughout the concert.

Conducting is entirely a cumulative art, whose outstanding practitioners reveal their mastery over the long haul, not in virtuosic instants. An episode like Leonard Bernstein's famous overnight success with the New York Philharmonic is a glaring exception. Generally speaking, there are no conducting prodigies, and many talents rise to greatness only in old age. A night of good conducting is, after all, merely the average of a hundred musicians' efforts, and a great conducting career the average of many thousands of such nights.   So it is very difficult to draw conclusions from a single set of performances, as the distinguished jury of the American Symphony Orchestra's Stokowski Conducting Competition had to do at a finals concert on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall. Yet it was not a futile exercise. One conductor did clearly stand out from two other finalists, although not enough for the jury to award a first prize. Jan Wagner, originally of Austria and now based in Minnesota, won second prize, and Steven Zike and Sebrina Alfonso shared third prize. Such overnight ranking is risky, but we undeniably need some new way of detecting podium talent; the old European system, with its long apprenticeships in provincial outposts, no longer provides a dependable hierarchy through which good conductors can surface.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Bank Regulator Says Clinton Sought Advice on S.& L.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/us/bank-regulator-says-clinton-sought-advice-on-s-l.html","abstract":"  President Clinton asked the nation's top bank regulator over the last New Year's holiday whether he could provide legal advice concerning the President's personal ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loan, according to an interagency memorandum written by the regulator.

The celebrants are not the Red Army Faction or Middle East terrorists but the entire German political establishment, and they will be honoring the 50th anniversary of the attempted assassination of Chancellor Adolf Hitler on July 20, 1944. \n\nIt may seem ironic that a failed attempt at high treason by a group of reactionary German aristocrats is a significant thread holding together the dignity of a proud nation. But the Germans want more than a positive economic balance sheet and a monotonous string of democratic elections: they need a history to be proud of. In the 20th century, that history consists largely of the failed conspiracy to kill a wayward Austrian corporal whose absurd fantasies bathed a continent in blood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Schedule Says It's Minnesota","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/sports/sports-people-basketball-schedule-says-it-s-minnesota.html","abstract":"  Federal District Judge JAMES ROSENBAUM ruled yesterday in Minneapolis that the National Basketball Association may release next season's schedule, invalidating last Thursday's ruling by State District Judge BERNETTE JOHNSON of New Orleans forbidding the release until the Minnesota Timberwolves' sale is resolved.

In the next few weeks, Mr. Garcetti will announce whether he will ask a jury to recommend a death sentence for Mr. Simpson if it convicts him of first-degree murder in the killings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald L. Goldman. Under California law, a double-murder conviction can warrant the death penalty. But most legal experts say, for a number of reasons, that if Mr. Simpson is convicted he may not be a strong candidate for capital punishment, which in California is by gas or lethal injection, with the choice given to the condemned person.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Scheming in the Interest Of Literacy and a Friend","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/theater/theater-review-scheming-in-the-interest-of-literacy-and-a-friend.html","abstract":"  Mingling old-fashioned innocence and contemporary calculation to charming and purposeful effect is \"The Great Brain,\" the new musical enlivening the summer season at the Promenade Theater, Broadway and 76th Street, under the auspices of the children's theater company Theaterworks/USA.   \"The Great Brain,\" adapted from a semiautobiographical story by John D.

Space budgets shriveled. NASA lowered its sights. Instead of venturing onward to Mars, astronauts now cling close to home, working only in low earth orbit. It is as if, critics say, Columbus's epic voyage to the New World had been followed with boat trips around the harbor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940720","headline":"Two Brooklyn Players Hurt in Crash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/20/sports/sports-people-college-basketball-two-brooklyn-players-hurt-in-crash.html","abstract":"  Two California-Irvine basketball prospects from Brooklyn were injured early yesterday when the convertible they were in went over a center divider, hit a tree and overturned near the campus, the police said.

In the greatest mass flight of people in modern times, more than a million Rwandans surged within 48 hours into neighboring Zaire. The town of Goma is now encircled by the world's largest refugee settlement, a distinction held only recently by the town of Ngara in Tanzania, where 250,000 Rwandans, most of them Hutus, fled in terror some weeks ago, fearing massacres by an advancing Tutsi-led rebel army. The total of refugees who have fled Rwanda is now estimated to be 2.1 million.   In Zaire, unlike Tanzania, few aid agencies are operating, and simply providing subsistence rations to the million Rwandans there is a colossal task. President Clinton has taken the right first step in sending Brian Atwood, the official of the American aid agency in charge of humanitarian relief, to Goma. The White House has approved 80 airlift missions and $31 million in emergency funds for food and medicine; this is in addition to $118 million in aid already airlifted to Rwanda.

The same spirited precision buoyed the other movements of the C-major quartet, which is at once the most classically trim and most harmonically adventurous of the middle quartets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940720","headline":"The Incorrect Mr. Kraft","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/20/opinion/the-incorrect-mr-kraft.html","abstract":"  So what does the Yankees' management really think?

The weekend settlement with Microsoft -- whose MS-DOS and Windows programs dominate the market for operating systems that run personal computers -- provides a useful fix to some anticompetitive practices. But it does not take unnecessary whacks at America's premier high-tech company.   The settlement would require Microsoft to abandon several anticompetitive practices. For example, Microsoft would not be allowed to enter contracts with computer manufacturers that prevent them from doing business with Microsoft's competitors. And Microsoft could no longer charge manufacturers of personal computers according to the number of computers they manufactured -- whether or not they were loaded with Microsoft's operating system. This pricing system forced manufacturers who installed a competing operating system to pay, in effect, a second royalty.

(AP)   GOLF  Palmer Joins 2 Others at Top  Arnold Palmer fired a three-under-par 69 in the Senior British Open yesterday in Lytham, England, and tied for the first-round lead with Liam Higgins of Ireland and Alberto Croce of Italy. Palmer played the last 14 holes in six under par, shooting an eagle at the 15th where he used a driver, a 1-iron and one putt. The former British Open champion Tony Jacklin was disqualified for signing an incorrect score card at the Royal Lytham and St. Anne's, the same course on which he won the Open 25 years ago. Making his debut on the British seniors circuit, Jacklin signed for a four at the 13th hole, when he had actually taken five strokes. He also took an eight at the par-5 11th after his ball rebounded onto his chest as he tried to escape from a greenside bunker. Jacklin completed his round in 81, nine over par.
