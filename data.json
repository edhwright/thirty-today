But whenever he questioned his grandmother, the soft-spoken woman would say in a firm voice, \"The war is over.\" \n\nMr. Berkowitz began to piece together his father's past on a trip to Israel during college when he met a cousin who explained how Mr. Berkowitz's father, at the age of 12, had escaped with his parents into the woods in December of 1942, two days before the Nazis murdered the Jewish people in their town or transported them to concentration camps. The family lived in the forest with partisans until the area was liberated about two year later.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Phoenix Tapping Local Acting Pool","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/phoenix-tapping-local-acting-pool.html","abstract":"THIS summer will be a season of firsts for the Phoenix Theater, based at the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase. \n\nOn Thursday the Phoenix will hold a gala benefit at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, featuring performances by Alan Arkin and Ellen Burstyn.

By whatever name, it has to do with getting to an opponent's mind, upsetting his concentration, disrupting his psychological equilibrium.   Some sports purists condemn it as unsportsmanlike. They claim a game should be won solely on physical merits, sheer talent, and perhaps a lucky bounce. But games are played in the mind every bit as much as with the body. The proliferation of sports psychologists on today's scene proves that. It follows then that if the mind is in the action, it's as open to intimidation or coercion as the second baseman is to the runner trying to break up the double play with a spikes-high slide. A Needle Nonetheless    In baseball, basketball, football and hockey, the jockeying of an opponent is usually verbal, very direct, often crude; and, as when Jackie Robinson broke into the major leagues, viciously mean and racist. In golf, jockeying is more subtle, in keeping with the sport's courteous ambiance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/travel/c-correction-610293.html","abstract":"  An essay on May 30 about rediscovering a Jewish heritage while traveling omitted part of a sentence.

In America, at least, photojournalists with long lists of awards to their names have trouble finding assignments, especially assignments that deal with difficult and depressing subjects. It may be that television news is so full of harrowing events that magazines are putting their money on reassurance. People can get bad news and appeals for pity for free; why would they pay extra at the newsstands? At all events, in a field where some sort of mass venue is essential, many \"concerned photographers\" find themselves playing to small audiences, devising projects primarily for books, or shifting into the business of celebrity portraiture.   Sebastiao Salgado is an exception. Not only has he been showered with awards, he has also been lionized by museums and widely published in the last few years. In 1991, his work seemed to be everywhere. This is a testament in part to his talent, which is undeniable and impressive, in part to the importance of his subjects and his evident sympathy for them, and in part to a comfortingly old-fashioned esthetic and belief in the goodness of humanity and its capacity to survive. Even his photographs of famine in the Sahel, the drought-plagued region south of the Sahara, generally played up the dignity, the classical grace and resignation of the starving rather than the horrors of their plight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Lisa Johannessen and Robert Hoak Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/style/weddings-lisa-johannessen-and-robert-hoak-jr.html","abstract":"  Elizabeth Ann Johannessen, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John E.

For a while, during the mid-1960's, it outshone the Modern and the Whitney and the Guggenheim as the New York institution most committed to the cutting edge in art, organizing exhibitions of up-and-comers like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns and Kenneth Noland, and the show credited with launching Minimalism, \"Primary Structures.\"   Then its trustees decided to turn away from a program that had little or nothing to do with Jews and Judaism. When the director of the museum, Sam Hunter, resigned in 1967, he cited as the cause of his discontent the \"increasing emphasis on Judaica at the expense of contemporary art.\" Thereafter the museum, while becoming more central to the Jewish community, often seemed like a backwater in the bustling New York art scene; for many in the art world, it virtually ceased to exist.   But now, when widening ethnic rifts shape urban politics and multiculturalism dominates intellectual debate, the institution's emphasis on ethnic identity and social history has become downright trendy. The museum that reopens today in expanded quarters in the French Gothic Warburg mansion on upper Fifth Avenue, its home since 1947, seems almost perfectly in step with the latest multicultural theories.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Sweet Ottoline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/books/sweet-ottoline.html","abstract":"OTTOLINE MORRELL\nLife on the Grand Scale.\nBy Miranda Seymour.\nIllustrated. 452 pp. New York: \nFarrar, Straus & Giroux. $30.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"They Are All a Lost Nation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/books/they-are-all-a-lost-nation.html","abstract":"SHADOWS\nBy Osvaldo Soriano.\nTranslated by Alfred Mac Adam.\n187 pp. New York:\nAlfred A.

The quickest way to describe the location of the newly named Queen's Bottom reef off Massachusetts where the QE2 ran aground is to say that it lies halfway between this little-known island and Martha's Vineyard.    By the time my wife, Susan, and I headed out to Cuttyhunk on our annual visit late in September, the island had returned to its somnolence. In history texts, the first English settlement in New England, established by Bartholomew Gosnold and his band of pioneers on Cuttyhunk in 1602, occasionally receives a brief footnote. But Gosnold's major mark on history was made when he anchored \"near a great cape, where in five or six hours we had pestered our ship so with codfish that we threw numbers of them overboard again . . . wherefore we named the place 'Cape Cod.' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Saratoga","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/travel/what-s-doing-in-saratoga.html","abstract":"  Unlike the Queen of England, who presides annually at Royal Ascot, modern Presidents of the United States do not frequent the track. Over the years, though, many Presidential families have visited Saratoga Springs, whose race track was called America's Ascot when it opened more than a century ago. And they have discovered this resort's habit, even as it evokes the old, of anointing the new.    As Abraham Lincoln pondered the siege of Petersburg, his son Bob came to Saratoga to celebrate his graduation from Harvard and found this ancient oasis agog over a new race course. Plans were afoot to create the country's finest carriage road, to be decorated with Victorian \"cottages,\" many of which sparkle on today's six-lane Union Avenue. Union Hall, where he stayed, became the Grand Union, one of the largest hotels in the world.

But the doctor was talked out of the transfer after he was asked a series of questions, not by another doctor but by a computer program called PsychPro.

The faint of heart may rest assured that even the maddest of scientists will not have the capability any time soon of resurrecting the dinosaurs. The movie, like Michael Crichton's book on which it was based, hypothesizes that blood-sucking mosquitoes dined on the dinos, and immediately afterward got stuck in tree resin that later hardened to amber, preserving the mosquitoes and the dinosaur blood for tens of millions of years.

In the most northwesterly corner of Italy, the Valgrisenche lies almost flush with the French border, a remnant of the ancient state of Savoy, an area culturally and linguistically French but held by Italy at various times from the 16th century onward. French Savoy was ceded to France by the Italian region of Piedmont in 1860. Tucked away between the celebrated Olympic ski resorts of the French Savoie such as Val d'Isere and Tignes to the west and Italy's popular Gran Paradiso national park to the east, it is often overlooked, attracting the few hikers and cross-country skiers in the winter who know its quiet old villages, profusion of Alpine wildflowers, pure air and good trails.   My husband and I drove up the Valgrisenche last July, on our way to the Gran Paradiso; the park border runs along the mountains separating the valley from the Val di Rhemes to the east. We had come to hike and decided to spend a few nights in each of the valley's three hamlets.   Our first stop was Planaval, whose old stone farmhouses, with slate roofs and wooden balconies, are tightly clustered below a waterfall-streaked cliff. Planaval is set among its fields, like a medieval village in its perfect simplicity: it consists only of a church, a few houses and one small hotel a moment's walk from the village.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Variety Marks Summer Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/theater-variety-marks-summer-season.html","abstract":"  FRIDAY'S convergence of openings marked the end of the winter season (\"Phantom\" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn) and the start of summer (the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's \"Taming of the Shrew\").

Jones began to talk to other Weston residents about bicycle safety, he heard four remarkable stories in just one week. One child, not wearing a helmet, rode his bike directly into the path of an oncoming car, flew right over it and somehow was unhurt. Another, whose mother allowed him to ride down the street on his tricycle without a helmet once, flipped over and had to have stitches in his forehead. And a third, an adolescent not in the habit of wearing a helmet, but doing so, lost control of her bike and smashed into a tree; the helmet was destroyed, but she was fine.\n\nThose stories and a host of attention-grabbing statistics are among the tools Mr. Jones employs in his crusade for safe cycling. With the AAA club in Connecticut and several other sponsors, Mr. Jones recently held a statewide conference on safe cycling at the Waterbury Sheraton. The conference's objective: to put the issue on the legislative agenda and to get the attention of the insurance industry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Janzen and Waldorf Are 1 and 1A in the Buick","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/sports/golf-janzen-and-waldorf-are-1-and-1a-in-the-buick.html","abstract":"  With bogeys remaining far more prevalent than birdies, Lee Janzen and Duffy Waldorf shared a three-stroke lead today after the third round of the Buick Classic.

Opens June 18.   \"SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.\" Tom Hanks is a widower who lives in Seattle with his young son. Meg Ryan is a Baltimore journalist who falls in love when she hears them on a radio call-in show.

An essay by Peter Haiko, an architectural historian who teaches at the University of Vienna, provides a competent and accessible introduction to the historical events and theoretical issues for those unfamiliar with the architecture of the period. The heart of the book, however, is the fine color and black-and-white photographs of more than 30 structures documenting the metamorphosis of Vienna from a Baroque capital draped in the mantle of historicist styles to the stern, uncompromising forms of the modern city. In addition to civic and religious structures, the building types surveyed include private villas, apartment buildings and municipal structures like gasworks, water towers and bridges. Like the finest examples of human portraiture, Roberto Schezen's photographs reveal character as well as physiognomy. While his treatment of facades and major interior spaces conveys the public decorum and grand scale of urban architecture, his photographs of building details and eccentric spaces reveal intriguing facets of his subjects. Mr. Schezen possesses a wonderful eye for decorative details. The result is an unusually subtle and nuanced description of architecture. This photographic paean to Vienna vividly testifies to architecture's ability to transcend the requirements of mere shelter and evoke the spirit of an age and the character of a place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"In the Region: New Jersey; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/realestate/in-the-region-new-jersey-recent-sales-776793.html","abstract":"  Alpha  $126,800   745 Pursel Street  3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath, 56-year-old ranch; covered back porch, move-in condition, full basement; taxes $2,664.

Yet it's possible to do so, and not just because he and Martha Graham created \"Episodes\" in 1959. That project was a pairing, rather than a collaboration: two independently choreographed works to music by Webern that were performed on the same program.    Balanchine, the familiar argument runs, was a product of ballet's most classical traditions. But this stance overlooks the questing spirit that led him to what was known from the 1920's onward as Absolute Dance. Among the milestones along Balanchine's journey toward that form are \"Apollo\" (1928), \"Concerto Barocco\" (1941), \"Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2\" (1941) and \"The Four Temperaments\" (1946). All four have been splendidly danced by the New York City Ballet during its current \"Balanchine Celebration.\" To see these works at the New York State Theater and to compare them with the way they were said to look when new is to gain insights into how Balanchine developed his own Absolute Dance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"'Humane' Isn't The Right Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/sports/l-humane-isn-t-the-right-word-541793.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   George Vecsey hints that the thoroughbred racing business \"carries the fin de siecle gloom of being yesterday's sport\" (The Times, June 6).

Bernstein's 75th birthday, on Aug. 25, will be celebrated worldwide, beginning on Monday with the New York Philharmonic's weeklong tribute to its former music director. Sony Classical is scheduled to complete its massive 119-CD \"Royal Collection\" of Bernstein recordings by the end of the year, and Deutsche Grammophon's release of his final recordings is now complete. With all the Bernstein videos flooding the market, it is only a matter of time before someone in Nashville, where Bernstein's archives now reside, \"sights\" him leaping passionately into the air at the climax of Mahler's \"Resurrection\" Symphony.   Passion is what Bernstein's music-making was all about. In his concerts, recordings, teaching, writing, speaking, one always sensed a life-or-death need to communicate the composer's message. Always controversial, he was damned in many quarters for exhibitionism on the podium, for exaggerating the music's emotional content at the expense of its structural integrity, for vulgarizing a dignified art form. In his early days and well into his Philharmonic tenure, critics labeled his interpretations brash and immature. Yet his audiences grew inexorably.

Quite possibly, the audience does, too. O-Dog's pants are slung fashionably low, showing several inches of his boxer shorts; the boys shuffle in as if they own the place, and O-Dog opens his quart bottle of beer while walking toward the cash register. They look and act like what they are -- members of the hip-hop generation, where attitude is everything -- but the Koreans obviously think they are about to be robbed.    It takes no time for the difference between Caine and O-Dog to become clear, though, and for viewers to realize that the violent, provocative \"Menace II Society\" is about seeing beyond stereotypes. O-Dog (Larenz Tate) shoots the grocer because the man has said, \"I feel sorry for your mother.\" Then he kills the wife. Caine (Tyrin Turner) doesn't kill anyone until days later, and then only as revenge for his cousin's murder.

Clarke, is a novel expanded from a short story published last fall in a special issue of Time magazine entitled \"Beyond the Year 2000.\" Nobody but Mr. Clarke could write such a cheerful tale about an asteroid on a deadly collision course with the earth.   As Mr. Clarke points out in the text itself and in an informative afterword, the scenario he imagines is by no means unlikely. Many scientists now believe that a collision with an asteroid precipitated the climatic changes that killed off the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago. In this century alone, at least three encounters with smaller chunks of cosmic debris have caused localized devastation on a scale matched only by nuclear explosions. Concern over future encounters has prompted the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to propose an international survey program to keep track of all asteroids and comets whose orbits might someday intersect the earth's. NASA's suggested name for this program, the Spaceguard Survey, is borrowed from a fictional effort described in Mr. Clarke's classic novel \"Rendezvous With Rama,\" which was published in 1973.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930613","headline":"Behind SUNY's Choice for New President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/nyregion/behind-suny-s-choice-for-new-president.html","abstract":"  THE lengthy and open process that led to the appointment here last month of Bill Lacy as the next president of the State University of New York at Purchase caused a serious rift between nearly half the members of the presidential search committee and the College Council, the college's board of trustees, who are legally entrusted with such appointments.

I planned to visit the Museum at Warm Springs, which opened in March to showcase a large collection of tribal art, and spend a weekend at Kah-Nee-Ta, a resort built at a hot springs on the reservation.   As Highway 26 crossed the Blue Box Summit, about an hour's drive from Portland, and began its descent off the eastern face of Mount Hood, the narrow, wooded view opened to frame a broad expanse of high desert.

Well, the New York Mets, now plumbing baseball depths unseen since the amazin' summer of 1962, have produced a player who's approaching an 82-year-old record for futility. Anthony Young, a young pitcher of some promise, lost his 21st game in a row yesterday, when he was beaten by the Phillies, 5 to 3.

Mr. Young endures all this with remarkable dignity, acknowledging the pain of his predicament but never giving in to it by whining.

Using a bare brick wall as background and a stage that reaches into the small audience space, Neil Peter Jampolis's design creates spectacle by inference. Portraits are hung and sconces attached. Lighting projections designed by Christopher Akerlind imply grand staircases, towering ballroom spaces or leafy arbors. Such parsimony is turned to musical advantage, directing our attention to the displays of singing on which the opera's uneven virtues ultimately depend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Ferreting Out False Claims For Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/nyregion/ferreting-out-false-claims-for-welfare.html","abstract":"  When Vanessa F. needed money for the security deposit on a new apartment, she thought she had a foolproof solution: welfare fraud.   \"I thought it would be pretty easy to do,\" Vanessa said. \"A lot of people do it by going to the different towns and giving different addresses.

Over the last several months they have reached a rough consensus that the vast plates that comprise the ocean floor sink deep into the earth's mantle, only to be recycled into giant ascending plumes of hot rock. The plumes, driven, some believe, by heat from the earth's core, emerge to form strings of oceanic islands like the Hawaiian chain or to blanket continents with huge sheets of lava.   The discoveries, said Dr. Michael E. Wysession, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who is an authority on the earth's interior, constitute \"a second revolution,\" comparable in scientific terms to the theory of plate tectonics, which, when it came to be accepted three decades ago, showed that the continents had been in constant motion over the course of geological time, carried along by great plates.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Bridge Toll Divides City Of New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/nyregion/bridge-toll-divides-city-of-new-york.html","abstract":"  A seemingly simple dispute over tolls on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has pitted Staten Island against the rest of the city, and is likely to be decided by Congress.

Twenty years later, Mr. Pogorelich made headlines when his elimination before the final round caused a ruckus among the jurors. Mr. Pogorelich ended up far better known than that year's winner, the Vietnamese pianist Dang Thai Son.    Mr. Pollini and Mr. Pogorelich are about to have something else in common: both are involved with new piano competitions, and both are hoping, against the odds, that they can identify pianists who will stand out in the already overcrowded field of contest winners.

In de-fending his decision, he said we have an interest in China's modernization. But this is true only if China's political development goes hand-in-hand with its economic development. A China that grows rich and powerful without becoming democratic will be more of a menace than a blessing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/style/chronicle-039493.html","abstract":"  The invitation carried the first hint that the party tonight for HARVEY LICHTENSTEIN, president and executive director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, would be no staid affair.
