Hillary wants me to cut 45 minutes out of the speech. Tell her there's not a superfluous word in it. \"How about those 6,000 words explaining what GATT is?\" she asks. \"How about those 5,000 words explaining the difference between a macroeconomist and a mackerel sky?\" Luckily we're interrupted by phone call from G. Bush. \"Friendly advice,\" Bush says: \"Whatever you do, don't keep a diary.\" Apparently there's nothing prosecutors like more than spending dozens of millions of dollars trying to subpoena diaries. This is the last diary entry I'll ever make. Not that I'm worried about being prosecuted. It's just that diary pages are too small to hold the forty or fifty thousand words I'll need every night to do justice to the events of my day. Albert Gore's Diary   Worried all day about the rain forest burning. Tipper begs me to give it up for the next 24 hours. She thinks it's worrying about all that burning wood that makes me look so wooden when standing beside Bill. Yes, empathy for the death of trees may be showing up in my posture as rigor mortis. After breakfast tomorrow I'll try to worry about global warming. Senator Nunn's Diary   It could be me up there tomorrow except for those popularity polls -- just one short year ago -- showing no earthly human could possibly beat George Bush. Richard Nixon's Diary   Of course I didn't expect Clinton to offer me a front-row seat for the swearing-in. That would be wrong. Should he ask me to head an emergency program to prevent the former Soviet Union from collapsing into a chaos perilous to the entire world, I shall accept it as a great American uniquely qualified for the assignment -- ought to accept it without pointing out that Clinton was not so quick to recognize my stature when invitations to the swearing-in were being handed out.  Marilyn Quayle's Diary   Dan thinks increasingly of being the next President. This morning he asked, if I became First Lady, would I let him invite Murphy Brown to the White House. I asked why in the world he would want to do that. He said he thinks his attack on Murphy Brown cost votes in the last election and believes inviting her to the White House would show he has nothing against her, thus winning over her supporters and helping himself to get elected. I pointed out that if I were the First Lady he would already have been elected, so wouldn't need the Murphy Brown vote. \"Good thinking, Marilyn,\" he told me, as usual. Barbara Bush's Diary   Keeping my eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole, thank Heaven George will no longer have to prove he's just plain folks by stuffing himself on pork rinds that give him those awful gas pains.  Mario Cuomo's Diary   Sure it could be me up there tomorrow except for those popularity polls showing no human on earth could beat George Bush, in addition to many, many other factors which tempt me to contradict myself and say, No, it could not be me up there tomorrow. Tomorrow! Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace, as Shakespeare observed. But I shall save that for my journal, not throw it away on a flimsy diary. Some think my journal has literary merit, and literature will always outlast the governorship of New York. Its other advantage is that you don't have to go to Albany to do it.  Saddam Hussein's Diary   The hour of glory approaches. The father of evil, the Satan of Satans, the poisonous begetter of mothers of all battles will be forever stripped of his power tomorrow. As I have commanded the author of destiny to write, \"It is writ that when the abominable Bush is struck from power, the rule of Saddam will roll on unbroken upon mighty blasts of heated air.\" Powerful is my prose. Beware thereof, O Clinton!  Ronald Reagan's Diary   There they go again.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/nyregion/c-corrections-056593.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Friday about Josephine T.

This Requiem hid its origins; it had an organic character, with each movement establishing its own pulse and breath. The performance seemed almost improvised, so natural were its gestures.    Yet behind this performance was a six-day workshop run by Mr. Shaw in which participants from 36 states sang sustained monotones, walked around in circles, counted beats like first-year music students and clapped rhythms. Before the Offertorium could create that other-worldly quality, the singers had to learn to sing without accent but with precise articulation. Before the setting of the \"Salva Me\" text could seem a matter of devout respiration, Mr. Shaw tried conducting three beats to the singers' four -- so they would end up feeling only the pulse of the first. Some early readings focused only on rhythms, sung softly: \"one, and, two, and, tree, and\" (the \"tree\" sound being quicker and more precise than an elongated \"three\"). The singers also, unusually, sang the lines of the piano transcription or joined, in unison, on individual vocal parts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/nyregion/c-corrections-055793.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Thursday about Thomas B.

But Gershwin fans interested in peeking behind the scrim erected by the composer's family will have an opportunity to reconsider the composer's life and times in May, when Joan Peyser's biography, \"The Memory of All That: The Life of George Gershwin,\" is due from Simon & Schuster.    The book, like Ms. Peyser's racy 1987 study of Leonard Bernstein, is a psychobiography rather than a musicological study: hints about Gershwin's private and interior life are gleaned from his letters, from his comments as recalled by his associates and from Ira Gershwin's song lyrics, which Ms. Peyser says represent a veiled biography of the composer. Gershwin himself is painted as narcissistic and insensitive, but also insecure and disappointed by his inability to gain a foothold in the \"serious\" music world.  The Unacknowledged Offspring    But there is also a good helping of gossip, and the section of the book that will undoubtedly be most widely talked about is Ms. Peyser's discussion of Alan Gershwin, an impoverished songwriter who was born in 1926, whose original name was Albert Schneider and who grew up convinced that he was the composer's son.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Rumors of U.S. Superplane Appear Unfounded","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/science/rumors-of-us-superplane-appear-unfounded.html","abstract":"  RUMORS and reported sightings of a secret American superplane have been proliferating lately almost as abundantly as yarns about unidentified flying objects.

By acting together, they are even able to bring down big animals like deer, antelopes and African bushbucks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"4 Wounded by Bombs in Palestinian Camp","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/world/4-wounded-by-bombs-in-palestinian-camp.html","abstract":"  Four bombs exploded in the largest Palestinian camp in Lebanon late Sunday night, wounding four people, including two children, in what security officials said was recurring violence between rival guerrilla factions.

One bomb went off outside the residence of a senior P.L.O. official, Moeen Shabaytah. He was not hurt, but two children in a nearby building were injured.

What matters are the sensibilities and skills shaping those formulas. So while set in a fictional Northeastern Ivy League college (actually filmed at the University of Toronto), \"Class of '96\" is not just a next-stage development of \"Beverly Hills 90210,\" Fox's hit high-school drama.    The crucial factor: the drama \"Class of '96\" is created by John Romano, who since the mid-1980's has been associated with Steven Bochco as a writer for \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"L.A.

Cuomo, less than 22 months from the 1994 gubernatorial election, is hoping to construct a different kind of legacy, an invisible legacy built by balancing budgets and improving fiscal practices during a relentless recession.   In proposing his 1993-94 budget today, Mr. Cuomo declared his first significant victory in the form of a $184 million surplus in the 1992-93 budget. He urged the Legislature not to interpret the surplus as a harbinger of recovery, noting that it resulted largely from decisions by New York investors to take capital gains in December rather than risking higher Federal tax rates under President-elect Bill Clinton.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930120","headline":"In Hiring Coaches, Specter of New York May Mean No Sale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/sports/pro-football-in-hiring-coaches-specter-of-new-york-may-mean-no-sale.html","abstract":"  Roger Neilson wanted to make one telephone call before the scheduled news conference that would announce his appointment as the coach of the Rangers.   \"It was to my lawyer,\" said Neilson. \"I'd reconsidered.

The large interdenominational church was, in fact, an ideal place to remember Dr. King and his message: on April 4, 1967, exactly a year before he was killed, Dr. King gave an antiwar speech there, and it was tempting to imagine him standing at the pulpit.    The concert was an interesting but, from a musical standpoint, only partly successful experiment. It seemed to be the kind of thing Mr. Masur has had in mind since he became the music director of the New York Philharmonic, when he spoke of building bridges between New York and Leipzig (where he directs the Gewandhaus Orchestra) and of taking part in New York's musical life beyond the confines of Avery Fisher Hall.

Prezioso, the man charged with bringing order to Westchester County's cumbersome system of overlapping local governments, will celebrate his 80th birthday on Valentine's Day. He will celebrate it, that is, assuming he can squeeze it into his schedule of 12-hour days and 6-day weeks. (He has not taken a vacation in seven years, he said, and he is proud of it.)   \"It's amazing,\" said Dr. Edward J. Mortola, the former chancellor and president of Pace University, who turns 76 next week and who brought Dr. Prezioso to Pace in the 1970's. \"I see no change in his constitution or his ability to work over the past 20 years. No one thinks in terms of age when they think of Sal.\" Westchester 2000    Instead, what many think of is an accomplished problem-solver who has served five Westchester County executives, three New York governors, one mayor of Yonkers and the Rockefeller family, although he has never held elected office. He also found time to earn a doctorate in education from Columbia University and to teach public administration at Pace for 13 years, ending in 1990.   It was his resume, as well as his reputation as a mender of badly damaged political fences, that earned Dr. Prezioso the unenviable job that he has held since 1986: executive director of Westchester 2000, a nonpartisan partnership of government and business that is taking a sweeping look at how the county and its municipalities govern themselves. The project has solicited the ideas of hundreds of people, most notably taxpayers and academics.   Among the questions Dr. Prezioso must address are why, for example, does the town of Greenburgh, population 83,000, need seven police departments -- one for each of its six incorporated villages and one for the town? Why is there a town of Ossining and a village of Ossining? Why must the village of Mamaroneck be in the town of Mamaroneck and the town of Rye, which is separate from the city of Rye?   After seven years of overseeing the collection and analysis of data from the smallest school board to the upper echelons of county government, Dr. Prezioso will issue the group's recommendations in late September.   He will then try to persuade local governments to take the bitter medicine that he is expected to prescribe for the county's 6 cities, 17 towns and 22 villages. That is most likely to include the recommendation -- unthinkable to many residents -- that some villages and towns should cast aside long-held differences and merge.   \"No one wants to give up the throne,\" Dr. Prezioso said. \"But we cannot afford to have that many kings.\" Fierce Identification    The problem, Dr. Prezioso said, is that with revenues shrinking and expenditures rising, it has become an unjustifiable luxury to maintain the quilt of sometimes redundant jurisdictions that is the hallmark of Westchester governance.   Simplifying such interlocking relationships will be no mean feat, in part because Westchester residents, like others throughout the New York metropolitan region and the nation, fiercely identify with the communities where they live.   In Elmsford, an incorporated village of 3,900 that is within the town of Greenburgh, there was talk in the mid-1980's of absorbing the village government into that of the much larger town. The residents of Elmsford shot the proposal down, said Arthur DeAngelis, the village mayor.   \"They wanted their own control,\" Mayor DeAngelis said of Elmsford residents. \"In our village, the police know everyone. When they see kids on the corner and something happens, they know what kids were in the area that could have done it. We'll go to the parents and they take disciplinary action. A small village, you can do that.\"   If consolidation is necessary, Mayor DeAngelis said, then why not eliminate Greenburgh's government, which he believes has been rendered unnecessary by the six \"self-sufficient\" village governments within the town.   Not surprisingly, the Greenburgh town supervisor, Paul Feiner, disagrees. He says Greenburgh's government is needed to oversee an unincorporated section of town, as well as to administer townwide services like tax collection and painting street lines. It would, he said, be too costly for the villages to handle the town functions on their own.   \"I don't think Westchester really needs a county government,\" Mr. Feiner counters.   And so it goes.   While agreeing with Dr. Prezioso that Westchester government has become too costly and layered, Dr. Anthony Cupaiuolo, a professor of public administration at Pace, cautioned against too much consolidation. He said many villages sprang up within towns because many residents felt that they were losing control of their own destinies.    \"It's grass-roots democracy in action,\" said Dr. Cupaiuolo, director of the Michaelian Institute for Sub/Urban Governance at Pace in White Plains. \"A village of 3,000 people -- they elect a mayor! They elect a board of trustees! People can actually show up at the village hall and yell and scream about how government is operating.   \"It's a question of efficiency versus responsiveness,\" he added.   Dr. Cupaiuolo said he would very likely support some of Dr. Prezioso's proposals like consolidating services between municipalities, which has been done elsewhere in the region. Consolidation, he said, would save money without disrupting a community's sense of identity.  Resistance Expected    \"It's very sensitive and delicate material,\" said Sy J. Schulman, former president of the Westchester County Association, a collection of corporations that is a sponsor of Westchester 2000. \"People are ambivalent. On the one hand, they complain about taxes. On the other hand, they are proud of local government. They don't realize that pride has a price.\"   Dr. Prezioso, whose recommendations would be subject to the approval of the individual governments, said he would demonstrate that the plans, custom-tailored for each municipality, have been exhaustively studied and were workable.   \"I expect a battle,\" he said. \"I know quite well there's going to be resistance to change.\"   Asked why he would want a job with such aggravation, Dr. Prezioso said that retirement, to say nothing of a vacation, \"is for sick people.\"   \"There is,\" he said, \"a sincerity of purpose on my part to seek the attention of people, to show them what they're up against so that they can control the future.\"   Told that that sounded a bit stiff, he said, with humor: \"My chemistry is enhanced! My whole body vibrates with excitement in terms of moving people into certain directions!\"   Dr. Cupaiuolo, who was hired at Pace by Dr. Prezioso, says that his former supervisor's enthusiasm is genuine.   \"He has no need to do this in terms of some ulterior motive,\" Dr. Cupaiuolo said. \"Ultimately, he wants to see citizens well-served.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930121","headline":"Report on Melee in Belmar Criticizes Resort and MTV","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/nyregion/report-on-melee-in-belmar-criticizes-resort-and-mtv.html","abstract":"  A commission investigating the civil disturbance that erupted last summer in Belmar after a two-day concert and sports event today criticized the seaside resort and the event's sponsor, MTV, for not providing enough security at the event.

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,   Come, you may stand upon my   Back and face your distant destiny,   But seek no haven in my shadow.   I will give you no hiding place down here.   You, created only a little lower than   The angels, have crouched too long in   The bruising darkness   Have lain too long   Face down in ignorance.   Your mouths spilling words   Armed for slaughter.   The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,   But do not hide your face.   Across the wall of the world,   A River sings a beautiful song,   Come, rest here by my side.   Each of you, a bordered country,   Delicate and strangely made proud,   Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.   Your armed struggles for profit   Have left collars of waste upon   My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.   Yet today I call you to my riverside,   If you will study war no more. Come,   Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs   The Creator gave to me when I and the   Tree and the rock were one.   Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your   Brow and when you yet knew you still   Knew nothing.   The River sang and sings on.

Plant yourself beside me, here beside the River.   Each of you, descendant of some passed   On traveller, has been paid for.   You, who gave me my first name, you,   Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you   Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then   Forced on bloody feet,   Left me to the employment of   Other seekers -- desperate for gain,   Starving for gold.   You, the Turk, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,   You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,   Sold, stolen, arriving on a nightmare   Praying for a dream.   Here, root yourselves beside me.   I am that Tree planted by the River,   Which will not be moved.   I, the Rock, I, the River, I, the Tree   I am yours -- your passages have been paid.   Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need   For this bright morning dawning for you.   History, despite its wrenching pain,   Cannot be unlived, but if faced   With courage, need not be lived again.   Lift up your eyes upon   The day breaking for you.   Give birth again   To the dream.   Women, children, men,   Take it into the palms of your hands,   Mold it into the shape of your most   Private need. Sculpt it into   The image of your most public self.   Lift up your hearts   Each new hour holds new chances   For new beginnings.   Do not be wedded forever   To fear, yoked eternally   To brutishness.   The horizon leans forward,   Offering you space to place new steps of change.   Here, on the pulse of this fine day   You may have the courage   To look up and out and upon me, the   Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.   No less to Midas than the mendicant.   No less to you now than the mastodon then.   Here, on the pulse of this new day   You may have the grace to look up and out   And into your sister's eyes, into   Your brother's face, your country   And say simply   Very simply   With hope   Good morning.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930121","headline":"Wheaton Topples Chang With Humble Approach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/sports/tennis-wheaton-topples-chang-with-humble-approach.html","abstract":"  A year ago, a David Wheaton victory over Michael Chang would not have been considered an upset.
