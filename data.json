Moreover, Council concerns over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's October proposal that much of the cutting be imposed on social services are justified. But the Council's authority to vote its own plan is ambiguous. Both sides should want the courts to clear up the ambiguity, though it would be risky and costly to delay cuts while courts ruminate.   This confrontation is over political muscle, not fiscal details. The revised City Charter gave the Council substantially more power than before. Up to this point, the Council has not exploited that power aggressively. Now its Democratic majority is embarrassed by its failure to press for more changes in the new Republican Mayor's original budget when it could have done so last June.

Beckner, who is 21 years old, was the third-leading rider at Aqueduct's fall meeting when he went down shortly after the start of the third race. His mount, Young and Regal, took a misstep on the backstretch and pitched him to the ground. The jockey was taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I., where Dr. Andy Somma diagnosed his injury as a broken clavicle, and held him for observation because of tingling in his left foot.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941126","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/26/nyregion/inside-931985.html","abstract":"  Giuliani Reverses Some Cuts   Mayor Giuliani accepted some of the City Council's proposals to restore services he had planned to cut, but stopped far short of the $96.6 million the Council sought.

What she offers is a sweet, beautifully manipulated and, in her best moments, seductively sensual sound. But much of the time, this sheer vocal beauty comes at a cost in depth. How serious a problem that is depends on what a listener looks for in a recital. There are times, after all, when one is grateful for ravishing vocalism and willing to overlook everything else.    Perhaps the best example of this transaction at work on Tuesday was Haydn's \"Grande Scena di Berenice,\" a showpiece that draws both its form and its energy from touching on emotional extremes, and which demands considerable vocal flexibility. Flexibility was no problem for Miss Caballe. She moved easily between the scene's recitative and aria sections, regulating color and dynamics in much the same way a master instrumentalist might. It was consistently elegant singing. Yet the work's drama and emotionalism seemed locked behind a patrician veneer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941126","headline":"Warsaw Bourse Weathering Plunge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/26/your-money/IHT-warsaw-bourse-weathering-plunge.html","abstract":"INVESTORS who entered the Polish equity market at the beginning of 1993 probably wished that capitalism had arrived in the Baltics sooner.

List for Gadget Lovers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/travel/practical-traveler-a-wish-list-for-gadget-lovers.html","abstract":"  THE gift-giving season is before us, and some of the most interesting travel gadgets this year are refreshingly no-tech.  Perhaps it's the surfeit of batteries in gift packages that make basics seem welcome, or perhaps it's the monotonous rows of airline passengers poking at their laptops and Game Boys.    A favorite new item, the Aquis super-absorbent hair towel, weighs five ounces, uses roughly the luggage space of a T-shirt and makes a spur-of-the-moment swim feasible.  Compared with a luxury towel, this one, of nylon and cotton, seems skimpy, but it blots efficiently and can be packed damp in its own plastic envelope. The standard version, 18 by 36 inches, is available by mail or phone for $17 plus $4.50 shipping from Traveler's Bookcase, 8375 West Third Street, Los Angeles, Calif. 90048; (213) 655-0575; (800) 655-0053 outside California. This version and a larger 6-ounce one, 18 by 44 inches are sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond in New York for $16 and $20.  Worry-Free Winter Driving    The prettiest new gadget is the Ice Device, a sculptured-looking clear plastic windshield scraper designed to keep the user's wrist out of the action. The stout scraper, said to be unbreakable, flows into a large loop handle that the user puts an arm through, taking pressure off the wrist, putting it on the lower arm.  Sixteen inches long, it probably will not fit into the glove compartment. It was designed by Jonathan Hamilton of Ashland, Ore.; (503) 482-6407. The Northwest Passages catalogue, which offers it at $12 plus $4.95 shipping, calls it the ergonomic ice scraper. Northwest Passages, Box 1548, Medford, Ore. 97501; (800) 727-7243.   Last winter's weather has spurred the creation of devices to help drive the car out of snow. One, the Bear Claw traction mat, is a pair of heavy-duty plastic pads, 6 inches wide and 22 inches long, with studs on both sides. The pads are forced under the tires to give them something to grip.  A pair is $19, plus $4 shipping from Traveler's Checklist, Cornwall Bridge Road, Sharon, Conn. 06069; (203) 364-0144.   The homeliest item is called a Ranger Vest, which looks like those worn by photographers and is really just a vehicle for 11 pockets. Maps can go into the big back pocket of the vest; cameras or lenses, small water bottles, jackknives, wallets or passports go into ones inside and out that zip or close with Velcro. A khaki model, made in China, in small to extra-large sells for $35 at Barson Hardware, 35 West 44th Street, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 944-8181.    Michelin's big new tourist map of the United States reaches as far south as Monterrey, Mexico, and as far north as Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Alaska and Hawaii are cut in. The scale on this highly legible map is one inch to 55 miles, making the map 40 by 56 inches -- useless for the car but good for papering a wall, although that would rule out using the index on the back. Land contours are indicated and roads down to the numbered state level are shown, as well as distances. For a change, this was made in the United States. Rolled or folded, it is $8; a laminated version is $30. The map is at bookstores, or it may be ordered by calling Michelin at (800) 423-0485.    The popularity of impromptu picnics has spurred designers to rethink travel utensils. Zelco, in Mount Vernon, N.Y., is importing Mangia, a full-sized stainless-steel utensil set with a knife that is certainly too sharp to be used by a child, but would deal with apples and roast chicken in short order. The fork and spoon handles slide into the knife handle; a plastic cap, available in four colors, snaps over the working parts, allowing used utensils to be thrown into a pack unwashed. The 6-ounce set costs $11 at Landmark Stationers, 330 Madison Avenue in New York; (212) 687-5885. In the Attitudes catalogue from Sunnyvale, Calif., a set of six is $50 plus $7 shipping: (800) 525-2468.  Shedding Light in Dark    A good safety device for travelers who jog in twilight, or for children who walk home on one-lane roads, is a flattish flashing light three inches in diameter that clips to a backpack, belt or pocket. Turned on, the six little bulbs light in rotation, creating a spinning effect that is said to be visible from half a mile. It uses two AA batteries. The Super Flashing Light is $14 from Barson or Northwest Passages, both listed above.   Fluorescent bulbs, which go easy on batteries, are appearing more often in portable lights. The Micro Fluorescent Lantern, 6 inches long, 1 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch thick, has a three-inch fluorescent wand that folds out straight or can be set at a 90-degree angle to cast light while the case rests on a flat surface. This is a fine hide-under-the-covers light for children, but would also help adults read maps in darkness. The gadget has a flashlight bulb, too. It weighs 5 1/2 ounces empty and uses four AAA batteries. By Zelco, it is available for $30 from the Civilized Traveler in New York or the Brookstone catalogue: (800) 846-3000.    Zelco also makes Lumifier, a tiny pop-out magnifying glass with a red light for reading programs in the theater or phone books on the street. The Museum of Modern Art Design Store in New York carries it, at $20, and it can be ordered by phone from Rand McNally for $15, plus $5 for shipping: (800) 234-0679.    Radio Shack's 6-in-1 Multi-Purpose Lantern, 11 1/2 inches tall, has a fluorescent lamp that casts enough light to read by. It also has yellow and amber flashers to use by the roadside, a spotlight and a steady red light. It stands on end and allows various lights to be operated in combination. This uses six D batteries, or it can be plugged into a cigarette lighter in a 12-volt auto with a plug and cord that are included. It costs $20 at Radio Shack stores. Phone orders should refer to item 61-2743; (800) 843-7422. Shipping costs $4.  Bibs and Talking Frames    If humans had been designed to eat from a tray wedged against their belt buckles, arms locked to their sides, there would be no need for Big Bib, but here it is.

Trithemius's optimism for manuscript production and pessimism for typography were both exaggerations, and many views on the computer revolution evoke this same ambivalence.    Traditional books will always be printed, and in good quantities, for the simple reason that when it comes to actual reading, they are vatly easier to use than a computer and monitor. It is inconceivable that anyone would want to try to read \"The Great Gatsby\" (much less \"Ulysses\" or \"Moby-Dick\") in any form but a printed one. On the other hand, as the essay points out so well, computer technology has already radically transformed the character of research, information management and publication.    When it comes to technological innovation, intellectual evaluation often yields to emotional anxiety. Trithemius was wrong: by itself, print destroyed neither book production nor morality. It did not even eliminate writing by hand. If computerphobes take heart in this, computerphiles might take caution from the fact that the technology they seek to replace was itself once trumpeted as the ultimate solution to problems cognitive, pedagogic and economic.

But right now, all over the city, thousands of New York City residents are flouting the authority of Section 24-221a of the city's Noise Control Code: \"No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated any claxon installed on a motor a vehicle except as a sound signal of imminent danger.\"   While losing your job for being late or suffering a nervous breakdown in midday traffic may fit many people's idea of \"imminent danger,\" technically it still doesn't justify using your car horn.   But, luckily for cacophonous car owners, the city does not pursue offenders rigorously; generally, the Environmental Control Board levies fewer than 10 fines a year for car horn violations.   To register complaints about noise pollution, call the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's 24-hour complaint line, (718) DEP-HELP. Sheriff Fetches Fines Q. I saw a white car marked Sheriff holding up traffic in Central Park. Who is the New York City Sheriff, and what does he do?  A. Despite its folksy moniker and long history, the New York City Sheriff has more to do with tow trucks than with gunfights. Established in 1626, the Sheriff's office in Manhattan and its equivalents in the other boroughs served as a major part of the patchwork of law-enforcement agencies that existed before the city's consolidation in 1898.   After that, the new New York City Police Department took over the responsibility for criminal investigations and arrests. As recently as 1942, the Sheriff was also responsible for manning and administering the city's jails, a duty now carried by the Department of Correction.   Today, the sheriff's primary duties are enforcing court-ordered judgments and fines, including unpaid parking tickets and littering fines, and collecting judgments from reluctant losers in private lawsuits, said John George, the Sheriff's executive assistant.   Sheriff's deputies, outfitted in dark blue uniforms and state-trooper style Stetsons, carry guns and can make arrests if they see a crime in action.   In recent years, the Sheriff's office, though small in comparison to the City Police Department, has been no stranger to attention. The previous Sheriff, Philip A. Crimaldi, found himself in hot water with the City Council and city marshals (who also collect fees for the city) for his tough tactics with parking-ticket scofflaws, which included seizing their cars.   Some residents also accused Mr. Crimaldi's deputies of using tactics reminiscent of the Old West, including brandishing weapons to collect unpaid fines. Mr. Crimaldi denied his deputies acted improperly.   But now there's a new Sheriff in town. Kerry John Katsorhis, a Queens lawyer, was appointed on June 2 by Mayor Giuliani as the 108th Sheriff of New York City.   And as for weapons, Mr. Katsorhis said shortly after his appointment that, frankly, he doesn't like guns. But does he wear a star? More Lawyers, by Far Q. My friend and I (he a litigious drone, I an artist) got into an argument that you might be able to settle. Are there more lawyers or more actors in New York City?  A. The drones have it. As of Sept. 1, the State Office of Court Adminstration shows 63,823 registered lawyers doing business in New York City. By comparison, actors seem practically scarce.   According to Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors Equity, the professional actors and stage managers union, there are about 16,000 professional actors registered with Equity in the New York City area. This figure does not, however, include legions of nonunion actors or actors working only in film or television.   Though more lawyers means more competition, they can take solace in the fact that they're at least registered as \"doing business\"; the average weekly unemployment rate for Equity actors runs at about 83 percent.

When an ambitious scientist diverges from his customary objectivity and loses his way in a jungle of human emotions the repercussions are profound for himself and his family.   \"A matter of love\" is how Jane Orttung today describes the preternatural relationship between her father, the explorer and mammologist Henry Raven, and her sometimes \"sister\" Meshie, who would obey no one else but him. This singular child, as loved and loving as any other growing to adolescence in the Long Island suburbs, rode tricycles and a kiddie car, played with the neighborhood children, indulged at ice-cream parties, went sledding and splashed about in a backyard pool. Meshie, however, was anything but a regular child; she was a chimpanzee.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Widowhood and the Family Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/realestate/widowhood-and-the-family-home.html","abstract":"  EDITH BLANCHARD sat across the table from her friend Lucy Hall in the vast dining hall at Evergreen Woods, a managed-care residence in Branford, Conn.

Sullivan, a former reporter for The San Diego Tribune and The San Diego Union-Tribune, has written an extremely deft first novel, THE FALL LINE (Kensington Books, 850 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022; $20). Not many investigative journalists have the sensitivity and poetry that are exhibited in this book.   The central character is Jack Farrell, a successful investment banker in California who represents a powerful Central American businessman. Farrell finds himself a hunted criminal because of what his job is really all about: laundering money for a drug cartel.   Mr. Sullivan effectively interweaves flashbacks, stream of consciousness and, above all, exciting action. Farrell is a daredevil skier, and heads to the mountains of Utah when he goes on the lam. He accepts a job offer from a mysterious Frenchwoman who is making a documentary film about skiing. Meanwhile, Government agents and drug lords are after him.   All of the characters in \"The Fall Line\" are believable. The reader identifies with the flawed hero, with his wife, even with the smart, civilized drug kingpin who sets Jack Farrell on the wrong course.     The title of Ross Thomas's latest thriller, AH, TREACHERY! (Mysterious Press/Warner, $21.95), is adapted from Plutarch's characterization of Romulus: \"He loved treachery but hated a traitor.\" And treachery is what this novel is all about. Mr. Thomas, a very skillful writer, lets us dangle for a while -- who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? -- as he unfolds his story in natural, free-flowing language laced with humor and sophisticated dialogue.   His protagonist is Edd Partain, a Vietnam War hero who is now a clerk in a Wyoming gun shop. Partain is sitting on a secret that is political dynamite. A figure from his past turns up and puts some pressure on him. Suddenly Partain finds himself working for Millicent Altford, a smart woman who raises money for politicians. A lot of money has been stolen from her, and she wants Partain to help her get it back.   Things get confusing. Something very big is going on. Powerful people want Partain out of the way. The C.I.A.'s dirty-tricks division shows up. Two generals try to outwit each other. Unsavory politics and politicians are laid bare.   Mr. Thomas makes some pertinent observations. He is concerned about the ethics problem that has so many American voters convinced that their elected representatives are puppets on the payroll of lobbyists or the special-interest conglomerates. Millicent Altford knows what to do. This is her response to a Congressman who has asked for advice on how to reform campaign financing:   \"Simple. . . . Do away with soft money. Provide Federal financing. Establish campaign spending limits -- proportional ones, of course -- so somebody running for the Senate in New York can spend more than somebody running for it in South Dakota. You know all the cures. It's just that most of you guys don't want to take them.\"     We have all read a great deal about the Mafia. Now here's another crime family, this one from East India. In Mitchell Smith's novel KARMA (Dutton, $22.95), we are introduced to some especially nasty types.   Evan Scott, an architect in New York, is examining the skeleton of a New York skyscraper his firm is constructing when a woman falls to her death from the building. An accident? Murder? The police actually suspect the architect. When he and his family find themselves in danger, he assumes the initiative. The hunted becomes the hunter, and Scott, aided by a sweet, dignified, elderly Indian, uses the skills he acquired as an officer in the Vietnam War.   Mr. Smith, the author of the thrillers \"Daydreams\" and \"Stone City,\" is good at depicting mounting terror. He has created a monster of a killer, an Indian giant working for the crime family. Toward the end there is a chilling duel on the beams of the skyscraper, and there is a final shoot-out that pushes belief a bit too far. But no matter. \"Karma\" will keep you engrossed.     In IXTAPA (Donald I. Fine, $19.95), E. Howard Hunt brings back Jack Novak, now on special assignment for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Mexico. Novak's objective is to penetrate a drug cartel, which he does in no-words-wasted pulp prose. Everything is predictable, but it's fun in a junky, innocent way. In STONE DANCER (Pocket, $22), the British writer Murray Smith concocts a computer scam that could involve the ruin of the American dollar. The Israeli Mossad, the Sicilian Mafia and the United States Secret Service all make appearances. The novel is unbelievable and cliche-ridden, but it's also lively and action-packed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Grand Dame of the G.O.P.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/nyregion/making-it-work-grand-dame-of-the-gop.html","abstract":"  NEVER mind that it was late November and that Election Day had come and gone and that a victory had been won.

To him, Dino is more than an intelligent, well-trained animal, he is a partner on the job, a pal and a member of the family.

Many deeply religious Americans, Catholics included, are greatly disturbed by the push to obtain public tax funds for New Jersey parochial schools. It is wrong to demand tax financing for parochial schools when there is now tax exemption for the same schools.   Involuntary tax financing for parochial schools that are contrary to the religion of millions of other Americans will polarize the community along religious lines. It will endanger the tolerance and religious peace we have enjoyed in America for over 200 years. Religion is taught in the churches and Sunday schools, in absolute freedom. That is what they are for.   The public school system, which has helped make America the greatest nation on earth, bar none, will be destroyed in time. The public simply cannot support multiple high-quality school systems. The average citizen just can't pay his regular taxes and support his church and support someone else's church, against his will. Let's be very clear and honest about it: this radical plan means stupendous new taxes.    If the idea is such a panacea, and people are so supposedly for it, put it on a statewide ballot. If the people vote \"yes,\" fine. If they vote \"no,\" forget it.   And this is a lay, nonteacher citizen talking.

Kennedy, and almost without realizing it found himself a member of a campaign in those early days when few people bothered to turn out for Kennedy appearances. Only slowly, he recalls, did he come to realize that \"we\" were running for President. The 1960 election won, J.F.K. asked Lowe to stick around and record his Administration. Given carte blanche to roam the White House, Mr. Lowe amassed, in the end, some 40,000 negatives of the Camelot years, what he calls \"the most complete photographic record of any Administration in American history\" in his selection of these shots, JFK REMEMBERED (Random House, $37.50). His commentary, witty and just a bit offbeat, accompanies stunning photographs, some familiar, some never before published. Mr. Lowe lends a new dimension to some of the era's most historic moments: the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Bay of Pigs discussions, the Paris meeting with Charles de Gaulle when the French leader used every ruse to keep the photographer away, the Khrushchev summit in Vienna with the Russian leader totally charmed by Mrs. Kennedy while the President looked miserable with Mrs. Khrushchev. Always at Kennedy's heels, the photographer was inevitably drawn into the private moments; the President insisted that Mr. Lowe take pictures of his daughter, Caroline, knowing that her mother did not want the children photographed. We have finally a personal retrospective on Kennedy history, private and public. In his foreword, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. writes that he recognized in Lowe a fellow historian \"with a passion to record actualities -- not to reconstruct for the sake of a prettier photograph.\" LYNN KARPEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Journal; The Victory Rush","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/opinion/journal-the-victory-rush.html","abstract":"  Of all those saying \"I told you so\" to the Democrats this month, no one is louder than Rush Limbaugh, whose latest best seller is conveniently titled \"See, I Told You So\" and whose voice reaches some 20 million Americans each week.

Were artists really setting down their spontaneous feelings and emotions, or did all putative original sensations come to resemble one another? In other words, did Abstract Expressionism settle into a fixed style in which expression became rather rote?\n\nOne thing is certain. The movement, whether rooted in myth or fact, has endured as a signature style of modern painting. And with its great chameleonlike variety, it is able to express a range of notions from decorative ones to ontological. It can question the essence of being, as is borne out by several works in an engaging group exhibition, \"Abstract Expressionism: An Ongoing Legacy,\" at the Gallery at Hastings-on-Hudson, featuring the work of 12 contemporary practitioners.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Janet Agoglia, Christopher Andolina","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/style/weddings-janet-agoglia-christopher-andolina.html","abstract":"  Janet Agoglia, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Agoglia of Glen Cove, L.I., was married there yesterday to Christopher M.

Mr. Endres is a certified philatelic appraiser and a member of the American Philatelic Society. He has been a dealer in White Plains for two decades and a stamp collector for 29 years.   \"It's not a short-term investment,\" Mr. Endres said, \"and to have a good long-term investment you should collect classical material in very good condition, not large quantities of modern issues.\"   He observed that good buying conditions have existed since 1988 when people started selling their holdings at discount prices during the recession. \"Now we are seeing an increase in price and a shortage of supply,\" Mr. Endres said, because what was purchased in the recession \"is being held by the buyers for future appreciation.\"   The Pacific Rim countries, especially China, are the hot spots for stamp collectors today, Mr. Endres said. \"Some 1970's Chinese issues are extremely desirable,\" he said. \"They were illegal to own or to use as postage in China because they contained inflammatory political slogans. The Government issued other stamps at the time with which to mail letters.\" A MUSICAL UPDATE   Victor Herbert's \"Babes in Toyland,\" produced as a touring holiday show by Troupe America under the direction of Curt Wollan, will be presented at Lehman College in the Bronx next Saturday at 2 and 7 P.M.

JOHN JAY CHRISTMAS   The re-creation of Christmases past at historic sites provides a major source of entertainment, and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah, a New York State Historic Site, always puts on a first-rate show.   It will begin next Saturday with tours of the Federal-style mansion from noon to 5 P.M., continuing Sunday and the weekend of Dec. 10 and 11 at the same hours. The house will be decorated from top to bottom, and a full complement of antique crystal, china, silver and replicated 19th-century foods will be set up in the dining room. The parlor, where it was customary to adjourn for the last course of the Christmas dinner, will display desserts, and in the study, a punch bowl filled with citrus juices and Madeira will stand at the ready.   The decorations and foods have been carefully researched from notes left by the Jay family, and visitors who do not wish to be part of a tour may stroll through the house at will, guided by a descriptive brochure.

After each show, cookies and apple cider will be served.   On Dec. 11 the Bedford Bell Ringers will perform at 1 and 3:30 P.M. in the ballroom, and downstairs in the kitchen a costumed cook will talk about preparing Christmas feasts on an open hearth. Visitors will be offered samples from 19th-century recipes.   More than 5,000 come to the homestead holiday celebrations, and it is wise to arrive for the puppet and bell-ringer performances at least an hour early.   Daily admission is $6, $5 for children and people 65 and older. Proceeds help maintain the historic site on Route 22 off Exit 6 of I-684. Call 232-5651 for more information.

If the sentimental old dears were to come back in an all-star revival today the intelligent modern theatergoing audience would walk out on them.\"   Well, as anyone can see by attending the latest revival of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's 67-year-old musical based on the novel, strong men are indeed weeping as in Magnolia's day, and at least at the performance I attended, nobody showed any inclination to walk out on any sentimental old dears. In fact, audiences at the Gershwin Theater are cheering, and even sober-minded critics more used to unamplified voices in grander-styled music dramas have been swept away in the musical currents. What a difference from Leonard Bernstein's \"Wonderful Town,\" which just finished its run at the New York City Opera; that musical may be three decades younger than \"Show Boat,\" but it seems as creaky as a dilapidated steamship.

Trithemius's optimism for manuscript production and pessimism for typography were both exaggerations, and many views on the computer revolution evoke this same ambivalence.    Traditional books will always be printed, and in good quantities, for the simple reason that when it comes to actual reading, they are vatly easier to use than a computer and monitor. It is inconceivable that anyone would want to try to read \"The Great Gatsby\" (much less \"Ulysses\" or \"Moby-Dick\") in any form but a printed one. On the other hand, as the essay points out so well, computer technology has already radically transformed the character of research, information management and publication.    When it comes to technological innovation, intellectual evaluation often yields to emotional anxiety. Trithemius was wrong: by itself, print destroyed neither book production nor morality. It did not even eliminate writing by hand. If computerphobes take heart in this, computerphiles might take caution from the fact that the technology they seek to replace was itself once trumpeted as the ultimate solution to problems cognitive, pedagogic and economic.

Why isn't it obvious that this writer writes the equivalent of cotton candy? Bite, swallow and there's nothing there.    Having read Mr. Ashbery and having come to the aforementioned candy conclusion, I thought that listening to him read his own work would show me what I was missing, and as director of the International Poetry Forum I invited him to Pittsburgh some years ago. Mr. Ashbery in person gave me the same impression as he did on the page. Here was seemingly sophisticated dullness raised to new heights. Why then this cavalcade of praise for such an opaque writer when there are poets like Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Mona Van Duyn, Linda Pastan, Hayden Carruth, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Barton Sutter, Brendan Galvin, Peter Makuck, Philip Levine, Charles Causely, Philip Booth, Miller Williams and Naomi Shihav Nye -- writers of genuine talent and vision with something to say -- unignorably among us?    I have heard Mr. Ashbery's prominence attributed to everything from another example of the tale of the emperor's new clothes to the influence of a friendly cabal on the East Coast.
