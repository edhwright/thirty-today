One might have asked such a question in 1987, when for the first time there were more people going in and out of London's airports -- a staggering 57 million -- than actually lived in the whole of Britain. But then, just as travel was clearly becoming a commonplace and the world was running out of new areas to explore, suddenly, unpredictably, the Soviet Union broke up, its ebb tide leaving vast tracts exposed. From Estonia to Mongolia, it was potentially a traveler's bonanza. Ancient cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Tashkent, free of the bureaucratic quagmire of Homo sovieticus, winked invitingly at adventurous beachcombers.   Appealingly, this would not turn out to be a one-way traffic. For once, the travel writer, sometimes criticized for being a selfish loner evading domestic responsibilities and plundering poorer countries for the glory of his own ego, could be making a real contribution to the country he was in. These new republics needed stories; their people, in the urgent task of finding new identities, needed reacquainting with both old and recent myths. Because of the often dire economics of these places, and their citizens' lack of experience and research tools, it would be foreigners who would start the process -- as well as communicate what they found to the wider world, in the true tradition of Marco Polo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"IN THE NATURAL STATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/in-the-natural-state.html","abstract":"IT took all the cunning of a 4-year-old to get to my father's desk undetected.

Yet while Chinese regard Mount Tai as one of the most famous places in their land, redolent with a history that goes back to visits by Confucius 2,500 years ago, it rarely appears on tourist itineraries.   It has been about 15 years since China opened up its doors to Western tourists, yet foreigners still crowd into just a few big cities, seeing standard sights, without ever meeting a peasant, even though three-quarters of the nation's 1.2 billion people live in the countryside. The tourism industry, in other words, has fostered a cocoon that allows Westerners to pass through China without ever quite stepping into it. Since returning to the United States after five years in Beijing, I have found that the most common query I get is not about Deng Xiaoping's health but rather about how to escape this cocoon.    What I tell people, to start with, is that it has never been easier to visit the \"real China\" beyond the tourist circuit. Independent travel can be frustrating, but with many hotels offering airport pickup and concierges arranging train and air tickets, few foreigners get irretrievably lost. Certainly it is hard to imagine a safer part of the world in which to roam about. While it is possible to take a regular tour of the main cities in China and then tack on a week of individual travel at the end, my recommendation is to go without a tour group if you are comfortable doing so.   The place to begin a self-guided two-week tour is in a Chinese-style courtyard hotel like the Lu Song Yuan or the Hao Yuan, in Beijing. Both hotels are built in the traditional courtyards that were once home to the aristocracy, and the 17-room Hao Yuan was the residence of the former Chairman, Hua Guofeng, until he was ousted by Mr. Deng at the end of the 1970's. Neither is convenient by Western standards -- the staff usually does not speak English and a request for a bucket of ice may take an hour to convey before it is understood and ignored. But the rooms are comfortable and the courtyards are full of the charms of China. On the other hand, if you place a premium on comfort and convenience, stay at the totally modern Palace Hotel, with its pair of gold Rolls-Royces to ferry you around the city. An alternative, also in the center of Beijing, surrounded by little shops and narrow alleys, is the Sara Hotel.   Any guidebook will tell you what to see in Beijing; my favorites are the Forbidden City, the Tibetan-style Yong He Gong temple and Tiananmen Square (including the Mao Zedong mausoleum; despite the rumors about wax, it really is Mao's corpse on display). You might also notice the high red walls of Zhongnanhai, an old imperial compound on the Avenue of Eternal Peace less than a mile west of Tiananmen. It is the new Forbidden City, the workplace and playground for today's Communist leaders. Visitors are not allowed beyond the soldiers at the gate.    Several Beijing hotels and shops rent bicycles for a dollar or so a day; they are one-speed contraptions but are usually functional, and in any case it is far safer to bike in Beijing than it would be in Western cities. Instead of sticking to the main streets, meander through the hutong, or back alleys, where residents live in one-story housing and share toilets with their neighbors. Rooms are so cramped that people often sit in their doorways, munching on watermelon or chatting with neighbors.   Almost everybody makes a side trip from Beijing to the Great Wall, but instead of going by bus, take a taxi and an interpreter. Your hotel can arrange an interpreter for $2.50 an hour or so, or you may simply run across an English-language student who is willing to accompany you for the day and interpret free of charge.   On the way back from the Great Wall, have the taxi driver take a dirt road randomly off the main route until you find yourself in the middle of a little village. You will find the peasants happy to talk to you, through the interpreter, and they'll be thrilled if you have brought a Polaroid camera and can take their photos.   AFTER a few days in Beijing, take the night sleeper train seven hours west to the much-overlooked city of Datong in Shanxi Province. Fifteen hundred years ago, Datong was the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty, whose legacy is a spectacular cliff of carved Buddhas 10 miles outside the city. The Yungang Grottoes include 53 caves decorated with 51,000 statues and carved reliefs, yet what is most awe-inspiring is the scale of the sculpture: stone Buddhas that soar up to 55 feet high. To me these huge, serene statues in the middle of nowhere are as exhilarating as Europe's Gothic cathedrals, for the offer a similar mix of artistry and spirituality.   While modern Datong itself is a rather grim coal-mining metropolis -- offering a much more realistic slice of urban Chinese life than either Beijing or Shanghai -- it is also less than an hour's drive from the Great Wall. Unlike the reconstructed parts of the wall near Beijing, the wall near Datong is the original -- a crumbling, worn mound of rocks overgrown with shrubbery 2that extends endlessly toward the horizon.   After five or six days in Beijing and Datong, head south to Taian in Shandong Province -- again by train, the means of locomotion for most Chinese traveling between cities. One of your short rail journeys in China should be by hard seat, the cheapest class, which is how ordinary Chinese travel, but the nine-hour journey from Beijing to Taian is not the one to spend jammed in an uncomfortable railroad car as people spit on the floor and converse raucously about the large size of foreigners' noses.   Taian is the town at the base of Mount Tai, or Taishan as the holy mountain is called in Chinese. It is possible to check your luggage by the train station and take a small bag or backpack for the overnight trip up the mountain. Stone steps have been carved up the hillside, so it is not so much mountain climbing as stair climbing. Most people can manage the trek up, with plenty of time for breaks and photographs, in five or six hours. A hotel on the summit, Shenqi Guest House, has private rooms with bath and a decent restaurant; it also offers sleeping bags and rents jackets against the chill. An alarm wakes guests at dawn to see the sun rise and proclaim, as Mao Zedong did, that \"The east is red.\"   Confucius climbed Mount Tai and came from a nearby town, Qufu, that is still dominated by the Kong family (Confucius is a European rendering; Confucius himself went by the name of Kong). Qufu is a typical country town, sleepy and gritty, yet it is chock full of temples and historic sites such as the family cemetery of 78 generations of Confucius's descendants. The town is an easy side trip from Mount Tai, or you can get back on the train for the daylong journey to Shanghai.   After several days of roughing it, you may enjoy the plush luxury of a place like the Garden Hotel, in the old French Concession of Shanghai. For the adventurous, the Chinese-run Red Flag Guest House, which used to accommodate only top party officials, now opens its bungalows to capitalists. A charming location and a sense of history and place are the rewards, but don't expect a concierge to arrange tickets or a maid to put mints on your pillow. Shanghai has some wonderful little privately owned restaurants and astonishing discos replete with Madonna-look-alikes, strobe lights and prostitutes who conduct their business with the help of cellular telephones.   The city also abounds with English speakers eager to ply their skills, and one or more of them will probably strike up conversations when you walk along the Bund, the historic riverfront district. Some are aiming to change money or act as paid tour guides, but others simply want to chat in English, and you may be able to find a terrific unofficial tour guide in this way. There are also con men on the waterfront, however: I once saw a pickpocket run down the Bund, chased by his victim and several onlookers; when a bus stopped on the main avenue, people inside jumped out to join the chase as well. The pickpocket was tackled, beaten up and then handed over to a policeman before the bus resumed its way.    After a couple of days in Shanghai take the two-hour, 20-minute flight to Guilin, a southern city in Guangxi Province that is the jumping-off point for daylong boat trips on the beautiful Li River. Three-day and four-day cruises on the Yangtze River in central China have become popular among foreigners as well, but the Li River is more scenic and eats up much less of a two-week vacation.   The Li River courses through spectacular rocky crags that are the inspiration for much of traditional Chinese watercolor landscapes. Children swim naked in the river as the boats pass, and peasants till the soil with water buffalo. The countryside is enchanting, so hire a taxi driver and an English interpreter for a half-day excursion to a nearby village, where you are likely to find mud-brick homes, a small elementary school with ramshackle desks, tiny backyard plots with pigs and chickens and flocks of little children who will make you feel like the pied piper. If you bring a few trinkets, someone may well invite you to a dinner of stir-fried vegetables and tofu with rice.    From Guilin, take a 60-minute flight to Guangzhou, the bustling southern metropolis also known as Canton. Ever since the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, Guangzhou has been at the front line of interaction between China and the West, and it was partly because of intrigues among Western traders here that the Opium War broke out and Hong Kong was ceded to Britain. The free markets of Guangzhou are among the most vibrant in the nation, and the Cantonese have a national reputation as sophisticates and gourmets. Yet while the Cantonese make great food, they don't know where to draw the line with ingredients.   One interesting but depressing sight is the Qingping Market, where turtles, salamanders, snakes, dogs and just about everything else are sold to be eaten. Afterward, intrepid tourists may wish to go to a snake restaurant or rat restaurant in Guangzhou. Snakes, in particular, are regarded as a virtual health food, a Chinese equivalent of alfalfa sprouts.    For those on a two-week itinerary, it is time to move on toward Hong Kong for the flight back. If you do not have too much luggage, take a bus or taxi for a few hours to Shenzhen, the boom town next to Hong Kong. Fifteen years ago Shenzhen was just a sleepy farming town; now it is a dynamic industrial city with a stock exchange, glass-and-steel skyscrapers, pin-striped lawyers and hundreds of factories churning out televisions, shoes and toys for consumers around the world.   From Shenzhen it is easy to walk across the border into Hong Kong, with only brief formalities with Chinese and Hong Kong immigration officials. On the Hong Kong side, trains take everyone to the urban areas. Alternatively, express trains run direct from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and minimize problems for those burdened by lots of luggage. The overland route is worthwhile simply because it conveys the feel of an endless construction zone; Guangdong Province has the fastest-growing economy in the world, and everywhere you look buildings are going up. Westerners joke that the official local bird is the crane.   For those with an extra week, Tibet makes a delightful side trip from Beijing. But be sure to get out of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and visit smaller towns such as Shigatse, site of a beautiful monastery and the traditional headquarters of the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan hierarchy. As everywhere in China, it is fascinating to visit the nomads and peasants who make up the bulk of Tibetans. Rural Tibet is still one of the most remote places in the world. I once met a Tibetan woman who was puzzled when I asked her whether her village had electricity. It turned out that she had never heard of electricity.   Most flights to Lhasa stop over in Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, the potbelly of China, and Chengdu makes a terrific break for a day or two. It is a somewhat grimy, very typical Chinese city of narrow lanes, tiny family-managed restaurants and, in the outskirts, peasants toiling over doll-sized plots of land. Moreover, Chengdu has, for my taste buds, the best food in China. I once took two Americans to dinner at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near the Jinjiang Hotel, and our table was soon laden with delicious spicydishes; there was more than the three of us could eat, yet the bill -- including beer -- was less than $5.    IN any case, wherever one goes in China, perhaps the most important thing is to spend time with the people.    In many cities, so-called English corners are set up one or more nights a week for local people to get together and practice English. Americans are hugely welcomed. Similarly, university campuses are a good place to meet English-speaking Chinese, and even on the streets you may meet someone who will invite you into a home for dinner.   In particular, spend at least a day in the countryside. My most interesting moments in China were spent in the villages, and the fascination was often mutual. On my first trip to China, in 1983, I was waiting for a train at a station in a rural part of Shandong Province, and so I sat down and began reading my guidebook. A few peasants gathered in front of me, watching me for entertainment, as if I were a movie. Then others approached, and soon dozens of them were sitting in a semi-circle around me, pointing and staring.    Soon nearly 100 peasants were sitting on the ground in front of me, the adventurous ones crawling in front of me to look at the cover of the book I was reading, and the episode ended only when the alarmed authorities led me to a small room and barred the audience from following. It was an encounter between two worlds, and I found it just as extraordinary as they did. IF YOU GO    In Beijing, an interpreter, official or unofficial, can negotiate to rent a regular taxi for the day for about $80 or a minivan (which are not allowed to pick up foreigners up at hotels) for $40. In other cities taxis should be a bit cheaper. Train travel is not expensive: a first-class train ticket from Shanghai to Guangzhou costs about $30.   Hotel prices are for a double room, calculated at the rate of 8.5 Chinese yuan (renminbi) to the dollar. The country code for China is 86.

By David George Gordon. (Sasquatch Books, paper, $5.95.) For gardeners everywhere, slugs are the enemy. Moving by night on trails of slime, they work their mischief wherever they go, leaving hostas and other choice plants in tatters as they chomp their way through the garden, using some 27,000 tiny teeth in a tonguelike organ called the radula. But gardeners in most parts of the country have an easy time with slugs, compared to their counterparts in the Pacific Northwest, where the native banana slug can grow up to 10 inches long and weigh as much as a quarter of a pound.   David George Gordon's \"Western Society of Malacologists Field Guide to the Slug\" (published, fittingly, in Seattle, where the banana slug holds sway) is brief, but gripping in its own way -- from the first paragraph (pointing out, inter alia, that the blood of slugs is green) to the last sentence (\"It is never a good idea to put a slug in your mouth!\"). Mr. Gordon provides a concise introduction to slug anatomy, describes more species of slugs than any gardener really cares to hear about and gives us an almost breathtaking account of the sex lives of these hermaphroditic gastropods. (The cannibalistic great gray garden slugs common to West Coast gardens \"are able to copulate in midair, suspended by stretchy strands of mucus up to 17 3/4 inches (45 cm) long.\")","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Westchester Q&A;: Michael Dowd;\nFurthering the Cause of Battered Women","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/westchester-qa-michael-dowd-furthering-the-cause-of-battered-women.html","abstract":"FROM a sociological point of view, Michael Dowd, a lawyer and director of the Pace University Battered Women's Justice Center, can understand how a judge in Maryland recently sentenced a man to only 18 months in jail after killing his wife, whom he found in bed with another man.

But like much of Los Angeles, the wonders of Hollywood's main strip take some ferreting out -- and require an activity not usually associated with the city: walking. Visitors may be surprised at the somewhat down-at-the-heel, not to say funky, quality of much of this street that is central to Hollywood legend. It has its own appeal, but one far different from, say, glamorous Beverly Hills.    Extending one mile between La Brea Avenue and Vine Street, the Walk of Fame is the heart of the boulevard. (The entire Walk covers two and a half miles, lining both sides of the boulevard from Gower to Sycamore, and both sides of Vine, from Yucca to Sunset.) In every other sidewalk stone, a pink terrazzo star set in a black terrazzo square bears the bronze-engraved name of a celebrity. A bronze symbol indicates the person's claim to fame: movies, television, radio, recording or theater. The tributes now total about 2,000 covering five acres. Four hundred are stars yet to be assigned; criteria is proof of ascendancy in one's field, plus some record of community service. Established by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the Walk is currently administered by them and by the Hollywood Historic Trust.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Focus on the View From the Other Side of the Badge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/focus-on-the-view-from-the-other-side-of-the-badge.html","abstract":"THINGS are usually slow for police officers, except when they are about to bite into a sandwich or to take a sip from the first cup of coffee for the day.

Of course, the list is not that neat, anyway; one biography is a foray in the continuing intellectual struggle over American history, and the memoir is a commentary on the same science taken up in the two scientific books.   The science is, broadly, evolutionary biology or, specifically, sociobiology, which, once it gets into your brain, can really spook you about genetics. For instance, once the list was alphabetized, it suddenly became apparent that the principal subjects of the first two books were both short, loquacious and bowlegged men. More ominously, the alphabet clumped the three books on sociobiology together in the list. There are other patterns here, but perhaps they will not bear thinking about. The writers of the books chose their subjects and titles, and the editors of the Book Review chose the Best Books; none of this was done by a pool of genes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"UConn Debates Ways To Farm the Sea","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/uconn-debates-ways-to-farm-the-sea.html","abstract":"A DEBATE about spending $60 million over the next four years for a marine science center at the University of Connecticut's Avery Point Campus in Groton has become a debate about how to best establish profitable ways of farming the sea.\n\nThe first projects for the planned center would be the cultivation of bay scallops and flounder.

Madonna and Wesley Snipes are not.   So say residents of the photogenic brownstones that line the streets of Hamilton Heights. The well-kept buildings are full of the architectural details producers love: front steps and stoops, wrought-iron railings and window boxes.      But residents complain that many film crews block tenants from their homes, commandeer prime parking spaces and leave litter and damage behind. Some have even become a little aggressive. \"There are people who will lean out their windows and bang pots when they start to film,\" said Christina Lee, a member of Community Board 9.   Fed up, civic leaders are trying to set up a system in which those who film in the community board district would make some kind of contribution: donating library books, planting trees or giving money to neighborhood groups.   \"Residents of the neighborhood make an extraordinary effort to preserve old buildings, to come up with gorgeous front stoops and front gardens, and do whatever is needed to make their neighborhood a lovely place,\" Ms. Lee said.    \"The film makers go in and film, leave their garbage behind, and disappear, never to be heard from again.\"   As incentive to shoot movies and television shows in New York, the city offers free permits and help coordinating productions. The Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting gives producers suggestions for filming sites, clears their plans with the sanitation and transportation departments and even provides protection through a 27-member movie and television police unit. The film makers pay for other expenses they incur, like moving parking meters or changing street lamps.    While film makers are encouraged to notify neighborhoods about their work, they do not have to, said Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the film office. Regarding donations, she said: \"That's an arrangement that would be made outside our office. There is no precedent in our office for this kind of thing.\"    On his own, Mr. Cosby gave $1,000 to the Convent Avenue Neighborhood Association after filming his television mystery show there last summer, and residents say the entertainer kept inconveniences to a minimum. By contrast, residents say the crew of a movie starring Mr. Snipes tried to block residents from their homes on Convent Avenue between 143d and 144th Streets.   Also last summer, when Madonna shot a music video at 270 Convent Avenue, residents say crew members tried to keep them from entering their lobby, and then mistakenly told owners of the co-op apartments that they had gained permission from their landlord to do so.   \"There were some hard feelings and also a confrontation,\" said Wil Buckery, treasurer of the Convent Avenue Neighborhood Association. \"A member of the board of directors of the building had to approach the Madonna people and sit down and talk eyeball to eyeball about what the true situation was.\"   Ms. Lee, an entertainment lawyer, said the community board wanted to begin telling producers that contributions are \"a tradition.\" And board members say they can describe Mr. Cosby's donations and how makers of the television series \"N.Y.P.D. Blue\" sent kindly worded letters to residents before they filmed and thank-you notes afterward.

This, some say, may be the future of cable television. It all depends on your wallet and how much you like to open it in the privacy of your home.   Since August, MTV Networks -- which also owns VH-1 and Nickelodeon -- has been trying out a home-shopping show called \"The Goods\" on all three of its channels. The program is a radical step for television, not just because it's a shopping show direct ed at a market untapped by QVC and the Home Shopping Channel (those rest homes for the eelskin wallet and the two-carat kunzite-stone ring), but also because it's part of regular prime-time programming. Though MTV describes it as a test program -- irregularly scheduled but frequently repeated -- \"The Goods\" has already outlasted the life expectancy of the average sitcom. The next installment, recommending the year's \"best\" records as holiday gifts, will be shown on VH-1 at 8 P.M. on Dec. 15.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/realestate/residential-resales-003956.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

Such notables as the Queen of Bohemia in the 17th century and Mme. de Pompadour in the 18th displayed their accomplishments in this line, and a good drawing style became a virtue on the order of a talent for embroidery or music.

But once we start paying attention to the passing sounds, music is not linear at all. It seems to leap about; our ears find echoes of the past in the present, form expectations about the future, spur recollections of other musical experiences and lead us to interpretations that have nothing to do with music at all. In our minds we pause, rewind, fast-forward, jump and juxtapose. We feel the linear rush of musical events, but we only make sense of them when fighting the sweep of the current.   Now we have a technology that works the way we listen rather than the way we hear: the musical CD-ROM. These disks, which slip into a personal computer's latest, most fashionable accessory, combine image and sound and text. They play music while showing pictures on the computer monitor; their \"pages\" of text contain \"buttons\" that call up other screen images and sounds; colored \"hot words\" can be clicked on, using a mouse, giving definitions and commentary; cursors can change shape from arrows to pointing fingers.   In fact, there is so much that is self-consciously novel about these disks and so much that allows just fanciful romping about, it is almost tempting to dismiss them as no more than pretentious videos for the MTV generation.

The Fontgombault monks belong to the same Benedictine community as Solesmes, but the architecture is much better, since it has a superb well-restored 11th-century Romanesque church far superior to the uninteresting church and ugly 19th-century abbey at Solesmes. In these surroundings, the Gregorian mass at Fontgombault was more impressive than at Solesmes, even though Solesmes was where the Gregorian revival began 160 years ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Peekskill Honors Pataki","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/peekskill-honors-pataki.html","abstract":"  There wasn't any ticker tape, but this aging industrial town on the banks of the Hudson opened its arms today to its favorite son, Governor-elect George E.

A visitor to the magnificent Alberti show at Mantua's Palazzo Te begins to wonder. Joseph Rykwert, the show's curator (along with Anne Engel), refers teasingly in his catalogue essay to \"an early, unhappy romance,\" and Alberti's subsequent career -- in music, mathematics, writing and architecture -- can be perversely read as an epic campaign to shut out feeling. Indeed, one comes away from the show with the strong impression that this great architect of humanism didn't like humans very much and was somewhat disgusted to be one. Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72) wanted to cultivate himself to such utter perfection that he would become virtually a god.   And what a divine show he makes -- the first exhibition ever devoted to this model Renaissance Man! There has never been an Alberti exhibition before, Mr. Rykwert writes, because his achievement \"seemed (if anything) too plain and obvious, over familiar.\" Why rediscover a figure who was never lost to time? For half a millennium, Alberti has occupied a secure niche. The author of \"De Re Aedificatoria\" (1452), the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance, Alberti showed how classical forms could be adapted to the needs of his day. The Roman triumphal arch, for example, instead of being a freestanding structure, could be treated as a facade. When used in a church, the arch would signify the Christian triumph over death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Morocco","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/travel/l-morocco-964360.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: After reading Ty Ahmad-Taylor's article, \"Encountering Morocco Head-On\" (Nov. 6), I am reminded of Larry Blyden, a Broadway actor and game show panelist, who died in an auto accident while on a Moroccan vacation many years ago.

The solidity of architecture is the antithesis of water's fluidity, and some of mankind's most intriguing structures play those contrary elements off each other. Indeed, \"play\" is the operative verb in this enchanting survey by Charles W. Moore, the architect, educator and writer who died last December at the age of 68.\n\nA tireless world traveler, Moore spent his strenuous leisure in pursuit of inspiration for his own architecture, which often incorporated fountains, cascades and pools. Those journeys -- to the Avenue of the Hundred Fountains at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli, Italy; the ritual baths of Sebatu, Bali; the canals and lakes of Suzhou, China; and the flaming waterfall at the Mirage resort in Las Vegas, among many others -- sharpened his superb powers of observation, description and evocation.

The director of the dig, Eric Sjogvist, amused at my reaction, observed how much more exciting it would have been to have found \"the rich glory of the commonplace\" -- you know, the things that would tell us so much more about antiquity than the official pieces -- Helen of Troy's shoe closet or Alexander the Great's collection of drinking cups (he was a notorious boozer in his last year). Had we had in our hands a copy of the imaginative, beautiful book called MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS: Twenty Remarkable Collectors in Pursuit of Their Dreams (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), by Mitch Tuchman, with spectacular photographs by Peter Brenner, we would have dreamed up far better ideas. This amusing and serious book is about 20 real collectors who are most certainly not collecting \"dignified\" things like Renaissance bronzes or Manet paintings, but vast, gorgeous and thoughtful works like Lionel trains, puzzles, toy soldiers and swizzle sticks. The book is a revelation and a joy. Mr. Tuchman, a California collector himself and editor in chief at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Mr. Brenner, the museum's supervising photographer, present the collectors, their beliefs and their pieces compellingly. After reading the lucid and mesmerizing explanations of why these gifted collectors acquire puzzles or aquarium furniture and after looking at the dazzling photographs, you may become as hooked on the book as its subjects are by their satisfyingly strange artifacts.

The film, which stars Demi Moore and Michael Douglas and was directed by Barry Levinson, has a setting as faddish as its subject: Digicom, a high-tech company that builds and programs computers. Tom Sanders (Mr. Douglas) works in a glass office with a door that locks electronically. He carries a tiny cellular phone that holds its charge all day. When Tom receives E-mail, the E appearing on his computer screen is three-dimensional and revolves, like another world.    This is only the beginning. Wearing a headset and standing on a very small trampoline, characters are pitched into virtual reality, an imaginary scenario that looks and sounds like real life. Once they are there, sophisticated computer software enables them to interact with this fake world as if it were real life. Presumably, they could be transported anywhere. And what have the whiz kids at Digicom chosen to represent in their virtual world? A New Orleans whorehouse? The Charge of the Light Brigade? No. A corridor lined with filing cabinets.

Mr. Auchincloss, who like his literary ancestors Henry James and Edith Wharton, feels quite at home with the educated and the rich, has written in DEBORAH TURBEVILLE'S NEWPORT REMEMBERED: A Photographic Portrait of a Gilded Past (Abrams, $60) an admirably concise, witty and yet sensitive history of the Rhode Island summer resort, from the 18th century through its social apogee at the turn of the century to today. Ms. Turbeville's photographs are beautifully shot through fog and cheesecloth, creating partly an aura of an old family album, and partly an atmosphere of decomposition and decay. Artistic distributions of dust, debris, disorder and dead leaves make us expect the sudden appearance of a ghost. But no, the only inhabitants of these images are some pretty fashion models looking uncomfortable, as if they had gate-crashed Mrs. Astor's wake. The book suffers from selective recall. Whereas Mr. Auchincloss pays erudite tribute to the town's distinctive and beautiful architectural heritage from the 17th and 18th centuries, Ms. Turbeville, like most of the tourists, focuses exclusively on the gaudy mansions. She compares them to \"the palaces of the czars . . . of the doges, or Versailles.\" But these houses were not built by America's industrial czars; they only paid for them. They were built for, and ruled over, by their wives, the robber baronesses. Newport was always a matriarchy. Mr. Auchincloss mentions the Touro Synagogue, the oldest in America. It stands within a stone's throw of Trinity Church; its existence is symbolic of the spirit of tolerance that led to the founding of Rhode Island. That spirit is clearly embraced by Mr. Auchincloss, who quotes from George Washington's moving letter to the congregation, but it was certainly not adopted by the owners of the Newport mansions photographed by Ms. Turbeville, or by their descendants. Hence the cobwebs and the decay.

A characteristically simple and lovely theme glides into being, touching on only a few elementary degrees of the scale. But it is all cast in octaves, doubled in the right hand and echoed in the left; this is melody with height and depth, a sound mass that hovers. (Liszt wrote octave doublings to increase the power of his thematic material; Schubert used them to broaden his music in space.) At the end of the phrase, the spell is broken: a trill rumbles low in the bass, casting an inexplicable gray shadow.   Schubert was a composer of beautiful melodies, as the legend goes. He was also something entirely different: a revolutionary who worked with blocks and layers of sound, harmonies adrift in space, jumps and breaks in musical logic, savage shifts of mood. Nowhere is his double personality more evident than in his remarkable cycle of piano sonatas. They show the composer at his most complex, most wayward, most searching; they are the blueprints of a new musical order he did not live to build.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Respite From Holidays: Bach, Haydn and More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/music-respite-from-holidays-bach-haydn-and-more.html","abstract":"  IT takes courage to present non-holiday concerts in December, but several such events are on the week's agenda.

But he came through: in front of a full house, he made a strong case for himself as an intelligent, musically sophisticated and graceful musician. He also proved himself to be a Sonny Rollins surrogate in that the audience was clearly on his mind, occasionally at the expense of his work as a serious musician.   Mr. Redman's best came out in the second tune of the concert, \"Rejoice,\" constructed out of a rhythmic pattern, a repeating bass line, some ambiguous chords and a rapidly shifting chordal passage. Mr. Redman's musicians -- Brad Mehldau on piano, Chris McBride on bass, Brian Blade on drums -- have been playing together regularly and are almost supernaturally empathetic, one of the better working bands in jazz. They made the tune completely pliable, with the rhythm section moving from frozen rubato sections to jet-stream swing. The elements of the composition popped up now and then, seemingly at the players' collective whim, and the whole performance sparkled, as if Mr. Redman had come up with a new group sound and a new way of codifying improvisation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"From Afar, Frier Still A Part of Seahawks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/sports/football-from-afar-frier-still-a-part-of-seahawks.html","abstract":"  They flew in to see his immobile body, hoped they would not weep, and instead he offered them tickets to see Chris Warren play football.   \"I told him, 'No!' \" said Mike Frier's father, Ulysses, today. \"I said, \"We aren't here to see a game, we're here to see you.' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"The Obesity Gene","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/opinion/the-obesity-gene.html","abstract":"  The identification of a genetic flaw that seems to cause obesity in mice -- and possibly in humans as well -- caused ripples of excitement when it was announced last week.

That temporary prior restraint on publication was thought necessary to let the Supreme Court examine the Government's dire warnings of peril to national security -- which the Court dismissed after inspecting the documents.    That experience should have taught judges to deny out of hand virtually any request to restrain publication, even temporarily. Yet over the years judges, almost casually and on flimsy one-sided pleadings, often issue those restraints. Judge Peter Leisure of New York's Federal court acted in that silly tradition the other day, ordering a halt to the distribution of Penthouse magazine's January issue.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"Former Surgeon General Begins Push for Americans to Slim Down","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/us/former-surgeon-general-begins-push-for-americans-to-slim-down.html","abstract":"  Dr. C.

The Goats played politically conscious, free-floating rap with deep roots in Philadelphia, and Big Chief made apocalyptic hard rock influenced almost exclusively by bands from its home state of Michigan.   The Goats are one of hip-hop's best live acts not just because they're actually a band (with a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist and an organist) but also because they find the right balance between their instinct to party and their desire to provide inner-city commentary on Washington politics. On Tuesday, the rappers known as Madd and Swayzack alternated between exchanging lines as if they were in a dialogue and shouting out phrases in unison. The music followed their lead, sinking into a slow funk groove during the dialoguelike verses and swelling into a cacophony of scratching records, riffing guitars and breakbeats during the choruses.    Where the Goats are influenced by lowdown funk and early heavy metal, Big Chief are obsessed by these styles. Its last album, \"Mack Avenue Skull Game,\" was a fake soundtrack that sounded as if it was scored by George Clinton. Its newest, \"Platinum Jive\" (Capitol), is a fake compilation that ranges from hard guitar rock written in the style of late 1960's Detroit bands like the Stooges and MC5 to rap. As the rest of the time-warped quintet alternated riff-filled grooves with coordinated guitar strikes, Barry Henssler sang fierce, proud lyrics about the dregs of society in a scratchy, vintage-sounding voice that sounded as if it belonged on vinyl.

The pianists could probably get an exemption on the grounds that the Australian-born Grainger spent most of his life in England and the United States. Life would continue as before.   The American Composers Orchestra is helping to correct this imbalance by giving over a portion of its programs each year to Latin American composers.

Such programs are banned in some states and only allowed as an experiment in New York.   The logic behind needle exchanges has always seemed plausible. In many cities, addicts who inject drugs have been devastated by AIDS, largely because the AIDS virus can be spread from person to person through the sharing of needles and syringes. One way to slow this spread, the reasoning goes, is to give addicts clean needles in exchange for used needles that may be contaminated. The addicts may remain hooked on their drugs, but at least they are less likely to spread the AIDS virus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941206","headline":"Mr. Clinton's Future and the G.O.P.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/06/opinion/mr-clinton-s-future-and-the-gop.html","abstract":"  Representative Newt Gingrich's freewheeling performance on \"Meet the Press\" and Senator Bob Dole's earlier foray into diplomacy affirm the Republican leadership's ability to dominate the news at the expense of a racked White House.
