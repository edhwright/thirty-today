In the kingdom of 20th-century composition, it has achieved old-master status, and that is how the Arditti Quartet presented it at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night. If the first half of this interesting if elusive program seemed exploratory, Berg's six movements after intermission represented a culture at rest: relaxed and confident in both its message and language.   The \"Lyric Suite\" has dark moments (the ending is marked \"Largo desolato\"), yet it is perhaps the happiest piece of music ever to come out of the Second Viennese School. The blanket description, \"Lyric,\" is accurate; the music literally spills over with a hopeful effusiveness. Berg's passionate heart is never headlong and rarely wild.

Yes and no. On Sunday night here at the Pensacola Civic Center, the band leaders were Led Zeppelin's main songwriters, the guitarist Jimmy Page and the singer Robert Plant, and most of their set was songs they wrote for Led Zeppelin. But they were out to rethink the music that made Led Zeppelin one of rock's most influential bands.   Led Zeppelin officially disbanded when its drummer, John Bonham, died in 1980. Since then, the surviving members have steadfastly refused the lucrative temptation to tour as Led Zeppelin, though they used the name again for one-time appearances at Live Aid in 1985 and at Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary concert in 1988. But its presence lingers. Led Zeppelin's old songs remain staples on rock radio stations, and its music has been the blueprint for numberless hard-rock bands. When this Page-Plant tour was announced, the shows quickly sold out, including the New York City area stop on April 6 at Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.

By concocting a fantasy that white males are a new victim class in the world's richest nation, they see a highway to a pre-emptive lock on the electoral vote. The tipoff came from the 1994 Congressional election, when 62 percent of white males voted for G.O.P. candidates.

I would dare to guess that other aspects of Friday's performance were brighter and fresher than they were in the 1969 original. Have the Met orchestra and its conductor James Levine, for example, ever made more elegantly sensuous music than this? Strauss's score scarcely conceals the carnal luxury and self-indulgent tenderness beneath its thin layers of decorum.

the college basketball season began last November, one of the problems Coach Brian Mahoney admitted his St. John's team would have was learning how to play aggressive, tight defense consistently. Most of his players were young and still operating with the scorer's mentality learned in high school. Selling them on the attention to detail needed to play defense in the Big East has proved to be a slow process.   Only in the last month, and particularly over the last five games, has St. John's played the type of defense Mahoney has been looking for all season. In its last eight Big East games, the Red Storm has given up an average of 78 points per game, a drastic improvement over its first eight Big East games, when St. John's allowed an average of 87.6.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950301","headline":"The Grumbling Gets Louder Over Voting on the Grammys","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/arts/the-grumbling-gets-louder-over-voting-on-the-grammys.html","abstract":"  In this week's issue of Billboard, the leading music-industry trade magazine, a full-page ad bought by Geffen Records lists the many magazines, newspapers, critics' polls and readers' polls that have selected \"Live Through This,\" the latest album by Courtney Love's band, Hole, as the best record of 1994.

Rather, the new findings indicate, prematurity is the principal culprit.

Each year in the United States about 31,000 fetuses die before delivery and 22,000 newborns die during the first 27 days of life. The United States has a higher infant mortality rate than those in 19 other countries, and this poor standing has long been attributed mainly to the large number of babies in this country who are born too small, including a large proportion who are born \"small for date,\" or weighing less than they should for the length of time they were in the womb.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950301","headline":"1945: Tokio Smashed : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/opinion/IHT-1945-tokio-smashed-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ADMIRAL NIMITZ'S HEADQUARTERS, Guam - Two hundred and forty city blocks in the heart of Tokio were burned out by bombs of more than 200 raiding Super-Fortresses in Sunday's [Feb. 25] raid over the Japanese capital, the 21st Bomber Command reported.

Giuliani to monitor police corruption had its first meeting yesterday, even as City Council members and some lobbying groups sharpened their complaints that the Mayor had improperly obstructed the role of the Council by creating the commission.   Nicholas Scoppetta, the chairman of the panel announced by the Mayor on Monday, said the two-hour meeting in his law office dealt mainly with organizational concerns: selecting an executive director, staffing and moving into permanent office space.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950301","headline":"Mr. Giuliani's Police Ploy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/opinion/mr-giuliani-s-police-ploy.html","abstract":"  The Giuliani administration has a well-developed knack for undermining confidence in New York City's Police Department. First Mayor Giuliani said he would ignore a new law, passed by the City Council, that established an independent agency to monitor police corruption. Soon after, the administration dismissed Walter S. Mack Jr., the department's top corruption official -- the first civilian ever to head the post -- and replaced him with an insider. Then Mr. Giuliani seized control of the Public Affairs Department, in a clear attempt to manipulate the flow of police information.   As if all that weren't worrisome enough, Mr. Giuliani has now deepened public distrust by naming his own panel to monitor corruption. It will be accountable to him alone, and thus more susceptible to political pressure than the independent corruption commission created by the Council. It will also be significantly weaker than the independent commission.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950301","headline":"Republicans Modify Parts of Their Overhaul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/us/the-104th-congress-welfare-republicans-modify-parts-of-their-overhaul.html","abstract":"  In response to Democratic criticism, House Republicans today modified some of the most contentious provisions of their welfare bill, including one that would have permanently denied cash assistance to children born to unmarried women under the age of 18.   In a major new addition to the bill, the Republicans instead proposed to pay a cash bonus to states that reduce the proportion of babies born out of wedlock. The formula they proposed would also reward states that reduced the number of abortions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950301","headline":"Mexican Family's Black Sheep Was Often Out of the Picture","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/mexican-family-s-black-sheep-was-often-out-of-the-picture.html","abstract":"  When his younger brother was President of Mexico, Raul Salinas de Gortari was seldom seen, but his presence was often felt in questionable private business deals.
