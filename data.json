Mr. Burke is a gospel singer as well as a soul and rhythm-and-blues pioneer, and as he demonstrated with his vocal style and attitude at Tramps on Saturday night, he can travel from the choir stand to the honky-tonk stage in a millisecond. He leaves you contemplating how few differences there are between the two places.\n\nWhen Mr. Burke sang \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" he articulated a sadness that blew through the room like a cold wind. Throughout the song, he ranged quickly, almost magically, from delicate high notes to low, growly utterances. Afterward he moved on to jaunty and familiar material, but the immense woe of \"Change\" was hard to shake. He performed standards like \"A Rose in Spanish Harlem\" and \"(Sitting on the) Dock of the Bay\" with invigorating, gospel-like fervor, but the torchy numbers -- like \"I Almost Lost My Mind\" -- showcased Mr. Burke's soulful depth best.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931215","headline":"Cheer or Stay Home, Jet Says","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/15/sports/pro-football-cheer-or-stay-home-jet-says.html","abstract":"  Tight end Johnny Mitchell practiced yesterday without wearing his knee brace for the first time in two weeks.

In this drama of a Ukrainian family's struggle to survive a Government-created famine that killed more than seven million (a quarter of the population) in 1933, the suffering is etched in the stony faces of people too weary and weak to raise their voices.   In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them. In the most poignant scene, a little boy who has lost his parents calls for his mother as he wanders panic-stricken through a snowy woodland where the trees are outnumbered by crosses marking the dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931215","headline":"A Condom for Women Is Winning Favor; Among Women First to Use It as a Shield Against H.I.V., the Device Gains Interest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/15/nyregion/condom-for-women-winning-favor-among-women-first-use-it-shield-against-hiv.html","abstract":"  Despite the jokes, warnings and lukewarm endorsements that greeted its approval by the Government, the condom for women is quietly gaining interest and often acceptance among the women who have been the first to try it in the United States as a weapon against H.I.V.

Narrative is the engine for the eccentric surges of movement and for the unexpected twists and turns that go with it. The vocabulary may be symphonic, but the syntax is not. Berlioz's colleagues built pieces of music; he himself imagined characters and situations and set music in pursuit of them.   Indeed, it is the unevenness of \"L'Enfance du Christ,\" which Roger Norrington, the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday, that creates much of its charm. Part 1, given over to King Herod's anxious dreams and the Slaughter of the Innocents, is opera pure and simple. In the first of many pictorial strokes, Roman sentinels pace to bass pizzicatos.

Symphonists before and after him wrote works that might be the centerpieces of concert programs but that nevertheless must share the spotlight. With a couple of exceptions -- the First and Fourth Symphonies -- Mahler's symphonies are so expansive as to require evenings to themselves. It's a good thing, because these works are as emotionally draining as they are long, and they require an involvement that would render the side dishes on the traditional concert menu irrelevant, even irritating.   What Mahler painted on these vast sonic canvases are visions of mortality and the vain struggle to defeat it. These are not visions of heaven (although in the finale of the Fourth, Mahler suggests one view of it), but of life and death in the here and now, with extremes of elation and despair transformed into musical topography. It is music that lends itself to peculiar exegeses: read enough Mahler essays and you encounter theories, advanced seriously, suggesting that Mahler's symphonies embody predictions of both world wars, racial strife and other calamities that have befallen the world since Mahler's death in 1911. It is as if the music's tragic scope is too great to be merely autobiographical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931216","headline":"CLINTON REAFFIRMS POLICY ON YELTSIN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/world/clinton-reaffirms-policy-on-yeltsin.html","abstract":"  President Clinton today played down the importance of the unexpectedly strong showing of anti-reformers in the Russian elections and said there was no need to change Washington's policy toward Moscow.

One of the great noise bands to come out of the Lower East Side experimental tradition, Carbon grinds and rolls away. There is pleasure to be taken from the rawness of its textures, the toughness of its rhythms and the sheer volume of it all. It's modern trance music, urban and informed. This version of the band features Zeena Parkins and David Weinstein, among others. Shows are tomorrow night at 9 and 12. Tickets: $10. PETER WATROUS Hargrove's Horn    Roy Hargrove, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. He's a naturally gifted musician, a trumpeter who can make difficult ideas fall like water from a glass. The blues is his inclination, and everything he plays is redolent of it. His band, tightly arranged, usually features well-conceived arrangements and will boast a new pianist, Cyrus Chestnut. Mr. Chestnut's a powerhouse, a deeply bluesy, hard-swinging pianist who won't let Mr. Hargrove relax for a minute. Shows are tonight through Sunday at 9:30, 11 and 1, with no third set on Sunday. There is a $15 cover and an $8 minimum. P. W. A Touch of Memphis    Charles Thomas, Bradley's, 70 University Place, at 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. Mr. Thomas, a pianist who lives in Memphis, is venerated by the Memphis clan of musicians who live in New York; they'll corner you to sing his praises. If he's half as good as they say he is (and there's no reason to doubt it), it's more proof that creative life can exist outside of New York. And it's hard to imagine a better setting for him than backed by the bassist Ray Drummond and the drummer Alan Dawson in the most intimate club in New York.

A show that begins with a glimpse into the cultural void of postwar Japan gives way to the queasy sensation that the West has also been swallowed up by a nuclear-age vacuum. This is a beautiful show, and it looks terrific in the great big blond galleries Mr. Isozaki has designed with James Stewart Polshek for the Brooklyn Museum's newly renovated West Wing. But a profound malaise lurks beneath the beauty.   Born in 1931 in Oita, Japan, Mr. Isozaki came of age in a country that was not only physically and economically in tatters but had also been torn from its cultural moorings. With its emperor demoted from a god to a figurehead and many of its ancient social customs outlawed by a new constitution, Japan veered toward the condition of a blank cultural slate. It is apt that the country later cornered the market in cameras, tape recorders and VCR's. With its own culture in a state of partial erasure, it is as if Japan had no choice but to fill the vacuum by recording the sights and sounds of the world beyond its borders.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Review/Art; Agleam With Devotional Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/arts/review-art-agleam-with-devotional-fire.html","abstract":"  \"Spanish Polychrome Sculpture (1500-1800) in United States Collections\" is a hidden-away gem of a show.

Surprising because many of the images gathered here seem far removed from 20th-century Western taste. This isn't art with the Neoplatonic reserve of the Italian Renaissance or with the courtly sweep of the Northern Baroque. Vivacious, minutely detailed and personal, these painted wooden sculptures have folk art in their blood and rapture and torment on their mind.

The annual tradition of holiday dancing in the halls of the Park Avenue Plaza with tea and shortbread on Saturday afternoons in December is continuing this year, with music provided by Panama Francis and the Savoy Sultans. The original Sultans were the house band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem when it was known as \"The Home of Happy Feet.\" Although never a member of the Sultans, Mr. Francis absorbed a keen knowledge of their style while he was the drummer in Lucky Millinder's band when it shared the Savoy bandstand with the Sultans in the 1940's. He revived the band in 1979 and since then it has played the rhythmic, swinging music that kept the Lindy Hoppers packing the Savoy dance floor. Tomorrow the band plays from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. and everything is free: the music is sponsored by Chartwell Booksellers and other stores in the arcade; tea is to be provided by Tetley and the shortbread by Walker's. In addition, Mr. Francis will celebrate his 75th birthday on Tuesday. JOHN S. WILSON Jazz Generations    John Pizzarelli Trio, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. The newest jazz club in Greenwich Village opened this week with a group featuring the second generation of Pizzarellis, one of the best known names in jazz of the last 40 years. The guitarist John Pizzarelli follows in the footsteps of his father, Bucky Pizzarelli, who was a big-band guitarist in the 1940's and leader of notable duos and trios since then. John, who plays a custom-made seven-string guitar and also sings, is joined by his brother Martin, who plays bass, and Ray Kennedy on piano. John actually represents the third musical generation in the family -- he was taught by his banjo-playing great-uncles, Peter and Bobby Dominick, who also taught Bucky Pizzarelli. The trio plays tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M.  There is a music charge of $12 and a one-drink minimum at the tables, or a $7 music charge at the bar. J. S. W.

There was no explanation of the significance of the shoes, only that they were found in an F.B.I. search of the Newark apartment of one of the defendants, Mahmud Abouhalima. The casual black shoes, which were inside a plastic evidence bag, were entered into evidence by a Government prosecutor.   Though nondescript, the shoes are seen by the Government as a significant piece of evidence against Mr. Abouhalima, who prosecutors believe to be a pivotal figure in the bombing of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, but against whom the weight of evidence presented so far seems far from crushing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Gladden and Deer To Play in Japan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/sports/sports-people-baseball-gladden-and-deer-to-play-in-japan.html","abstract":"  ROB DEER and DAN GLADDEN agreed to leave the major leagues for Japan yesterday, and three players eligible for salary arbitration -- Atlanta's MARK LEMKE, Florida's JOE KLINK and Minnesota's SCOTT LEIUS -- agreed to contracts with their major league teams.

The recovered works, all paintings, are \"Woman with Blue Collar\" (1941), \"Dragonfly\" (1929) and \"The Painter\" (1930). Their recovery followed the arrest this week of two suspects, identified only as Polish men in their early 20's. Sven-Erik Alhem, a prosecutor, said the paintings were found in Stockholm, but declined to give further details on the recovery. The suspects remained in custody today and had not been charged, he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Article 791093 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/arts/article-791093-no-title.html","abstract":"  Japanese restaurants, particularly those specializing in sushi, are often described as cool, reserved places where the graciously formal service can seem as ritualized as the systematically pretty presentation of the food. But Jo-An, which opened on Broadway in September, is an anomaly, a homey, family Japanese restaurant.   That's because it is a family restaurant, owned by the husband and wife team of Joanne and Sakusaburo Yoshida. Mr. Yoshida, of Oita, Japan, is in charge of the cooking. Mrs. Yoshida, of Freeport, L.I., is in charge of the dining room. The name, Jo-An, obviously a play on Mrs. Yoshida's name, has another meaning, she said, with the Japanese characters connoting \"a place where people feel protected, like a home, with warm feelings.\" Already the restaurant seems to have gained a steady neighborhood clientele, families with children fumbling with chopsticks, couples, Japanese students from Columbia University smoking and arguing, and single people who feel comfortable having dinner with a book or magazine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Adding Police on Streets Will Reduce Arrests","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/opinion/l-adding-police-on-streets-will-reduce-arrests-937993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   What Prof. Todd R.

Her material is her own body and skin. Her medium is plastic surgery, usually performed on her on camera. Her work represents a small step for Conceptual art, and a big step for feminism -- both in the backward direction.   So far, Orlan has endured seven operations in an effort to make her face resemble a composite likeness of five mythic women, ranging from the goddess Diana, as painted by an unknown Fontainebleau artist, to Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa.\" Each operation has been videotaped for posterity: at its center is the artist herself, who always stays awake throughout these procedures, accompanied by costumed assistants and sundry props.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Judge Asks if Law Blocks Race Bias Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/nyregion/judge-asks-if-law-blocks-race-bias-case.html","abstract":"  Final arguments in a school-desegregation lawsuit involving Hartford and its suburbs were suspended today when the trial judge questioned whether a new state law promoting regional integration plans effectively barred him from issuing an order of his own.   The law, proposed last winter while testimony in the desegregation case, known as Sheff v. O'Neill, was being heard, requires every town and city in Connecticut to take part in discussions on drafting regional school integration plans. But it sets no goals and provides no penalties for towns that refuse to cooperate, and thus is far weaker than a court order.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Why Should We Believe Britain on Irish Peace?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/opinion/l-why-should-we-believe-britain-on-irish-peace-930193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The ballyhooed Dec. 15 British-Irish declaration (front page, Dec. 16) is not a step toward peace but a disappointing recipe for more bloodshed in Ireland.

Better late than never. The Freud exhibition now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is startling, moving and unforgettable, and it leaves no doubt that, at 71, Mr. Freud is the greatest living figure painter.    What has changed in six years? About Mr. Freud, nothing really, except that his work has become progressively bolder and more astonishing as he has undertaken a series of mural-size nudes whose fleshiness and strange humanity have no real parallel. Appropriately, he calls these images of mostly unnamed family members, friends and associates \"naked portraits.\" They have virtually nothing to do with the idealized nudes of art history and everything to do with the swollen, lumpy, pasty reality of the human body, simulated inch by painstaking inch in paint. Oliver Cromwell famously asked the portraitist Peter Lely to depict him \"warts and all.\" With Mr. Freud, warts are the least of it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19931217","time":"1993-12-17
