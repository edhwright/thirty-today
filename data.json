The Masked Dancers of Losari, accompanied by a full gamelan orchestra, were led by Sawitri Sumitra, a 64-year-old performer known as Sawitri, who is celebrated for her interpretation of the Losari style, which developed in relative isolation. In addition to a somewhat different handling of the traditional masked-dance repertory and the different placement of the orchestra onstage, Losari dancing is distinguished by an angular, abrupt attack that gives its performers the look of hinged, stylized Indonesian shadow dance puppets. The dancers portrayed characters, in solos and duets, rather than telling fully developed narratives. Their masks, serene, fierce or grotesque, offered clues to whether they were good or evil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931120","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/nyregion/metro-digest-464793.html","abstract":"   ROLLINS EXPLAINS HIS ASSERTIONS   Sometimes expressing bewilderment and at other times turning morbidly plaintive, Edward J.

What these pieces all share is a certain urbane, post-Romantic extension of dancing rhythm: Strauss's pastiche of minuets and courantes, Martinu's stamping, folk-tinged sequences and Ravel's apotheosis of the waltz.   Unfortunately, the Philharmonic didn't seem to be in the mood to dance. The Strauss, at the beginning of the program, received an alarmingly drab and desultory performance. Here is a score marked with instructions like \"grazioso,\" \"galante,\" \"animato\" and, over and over, \"schnell\" -- fast. Yet Mr. Dutoit's tempos consistently sagged, and some crucial shifts of pace were brushed aside.

The mail has its own magic, its own intriguing rhythms, especially when it arrives unaccountably in a distant place. Hardly anything adds more mystery and importance to a trip than the alluring words Poste Restante, Postlagernd, or even General Delivery on an itinerary passed along to potential correspondents. For trips a little closer to home, mail received at summer cottages near the sea or woodland resorts pleasantly interrupts the hot, lazy days, calls for a glass of iced tea on the porch and generates a tingle of excitement at the prospect of real letters -- from elderly aunts, or foreign friends, or kids at camp -- to be read and passed around. And when a witty postcard reports on a giant fiberglass peach or chicken or other roadside oddity, even mere weekend jaunts become travel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Wiring the World for Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/books/wiring-the-world-for-politics.html","abstract":"THE ROAR OF THE CROWD\nHow Television and People Power\nAre Changing the World.\nBy Michael J.

He referred to an immense American \"capacity for enthusiasm\" for all things new, the essence of \"American push\": \"It is as if a boy wished to dive before he could swim.\" At first this characteristic bothered him in his pupils, but then he began to think that the best hopes for American music lay in this \"eagerness to take up everything.\"   Now Dvorak's three-year American residence has inspired a similar enthusiasm in celebrations of its centenary. Recently, the Bard Music Festival, which devoted two weekends to Dvorak in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., in August, followed up with another at Alice Tully Hall. Two excellent books have recently been published: \"Dvorak in America,\" edited by John C. Tibbetts and \"Dvorak and His World,\" edited by Michael Beckerman.

The patients, like Valerie Black, a 31-year-old former heroin user, and Rafael Serrano, a 33-year-old registered nurse, are being confined in New York's first modern-day tuberculosis sanitarium not because they are contagious and might transmit the disease, but rather because health officials say they have repeatedly failed to take their medicines. Strict New Regulations    Their confinement in a ward of the Goldwater Memorial Hospital is the result of strict new regulations that allow city health officials to detain tuberculosis patients for the months and even years it takes to complete a cure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Brutal Secrets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/books/brutal-secrets.html","abstract":"A WHISTLING WOMAN\nBy Louise Shivers.\n156 pp. Atlanta:\nLongstreet Press. $15.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Putting Downtown Back Into Hartford","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/nyregion/putting-downtown-back-into-hartford.html","abstract":"WHEN the downtown Hartford landmark department store G.

More significant beneficiaries of the Viennese revival have been Franz Schmidt, Alexander von Zemlinsky and Franz Schreker, from the brilliant generation born in the 1870's. Schreker's sumptuous Art Deco operas are appearing on the Marco Polo label, Zemlinsky's on Capriccio and Koch Schwann; Schmidt's four symphonies have been recorded by various ensembles.

As his dear friend Howard L. Bingham, a photographer, has said: \"He was born for the camera. . . . No one in the world has a face like Ali.\" For MUHAMMAD ALI: A Thirty-Year Journey (Simon & Schuster, $32.50), Mr. Bingham has selected nearly 200 black-and-white photographs from the one million pictures he has taken of Ali since 1962. The book, like its subject, is exceptional. It includes a fair number of ringside photos, but we also see Ali hanging out in Harlem with Sugar Ray Robinson and Roy Campanella; having his snapshot taken by Malcolm X and his ear bent by Jesse Jackson; playfully sneaking up on the ferocious Sonny Liston in a Miami bar in 1963 (even Elijah Muhammad picked Liston to win their fight the following year); and just generally having a good time, with folks sublime (Duke Ellington, Sam Cooke) and ridiculous (Sonny Bono, Don Knotts). When Wilfrid Sheed was writing the text for a picture book on Ali two decades ago, he pored over thousands of photographs and never came upon a single nasty one. Ali looks angry only once in Mr. Bingham's book, on the day in 1967 when he was indicted for refusing induction into the armed forces. Yet the man who had no quarrel with the Vietcong never seemed to hold a grudge against anybody, not even the bigots and boobs who kept him out of boxing for three and a half years and made sure that no one would see the athlete of the century at his peak. In the private, quiet moments depicted here, past and present, Ali comes across as too nice, too gentle, for bitterness. He used to brag that he could hospitalize a brick. He could probably get one to crack a smile too.

The reason is that nearly all the teams that challenge for the right to represent the United States include a playing sponsor, usually a player somewhat below the top rank who is willing to pay a large amount for a chance to win a world title.    As a result, in recent years there have been no clear favorites and several surprises: Brazil won in 1989, Iceland in 1991 and the Netherlands two months ago in Santiago, Chile. The Brazilian team, cheered on by local enthusiasts hoping for a Latin American victory, came close in Santiago.

Most Hong Kong hotels are clustered on the Kowloon peninsula, or near the Central business district. But recently, developers have ranged across the colony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Green Thumbs Tied in Red Tape","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-green-thumbs-tied-in-red-tape.html","abstract":"  A new wrought-iron fence is the only thing that sets the large lot on Lexington Avenue near 100th Street apart from the scores of other lots that dot East Harlem. That and the residents watching anxiously as the garbage piles up and the rats return.   The lot, a large L that turns the corner and opens onto 100th Street, has been leased by a development group run by several local churches. With a little soil, some trees and a few benches it will become a small park designed by residents of the block and local gardeners in search of a place to wield their green thumbs. But the city finances that the organizers are counting on are mired in bureaucratic reviews.   \"I hope the city will loosen up the funds so we can go ahead,\" said the Rev. Robert V. Lott, chairman of SFDS Development Corporation, which leased the lot. \"It seems like forever.\"   The group has been working with a nonprofit group that promotes green space, the Parks Council, which has lobbied the city to include money to help turn city-owned lots in low-income neighborhoods into pocket parks.  This year's city budget includes $1.25 million for such projects, but the Parks Council is one of several groups vying for the money. And each site must go through the city's land-review process, including many public hearings, so the $40,000 to $50,000 that the garden is waiting for may not be available until spring, or even summer.   Karen Phillips, who works for the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which is involved in another planned garden, called the process frustrating but necessary. \"Unfortunately, it's slow, but it's set up so it's not business as usual, so people in the community have a say in what's done with the land,\" she said.   Depite the delay, Linda Davidoff, the executive director of the Parks Council, said she was optimistic that the money would be available. \"I think this is a perfect opening program for the Giuliani administration, because it takes an existing city resource and mixes it with a very tiny amount of city funding to make a substantial transformation in low-income communities,\" she said.   Neighbors on 100th Street try to match Ms. Davidoff's enthusiasm, but it is hard. The lot was cleared a few months ago, and the fence paid for with private money. But the fence is not enough.   \"Look at that garbage,\" said Charlotte Hodge, a longtime member of the Ebenezer Wesleyan Methodist Church, which is next to the lot. \"It wasn't here a few weeks ago. Why can't people respect it?\" EMILY M.

El Pais has not only been a supporter of the Socialist Government, to which Mrs. Alborch belongs, but was also critical of Mr. Garin, particularly during his last days, when record rains caused conspicuous leaks in the Velazquez galleries.

With the exception of Ossorio, these artists, whether or not they stuck with egg tempera, pursued the Magic Realism to which the medium lent itself. But in the marketplace, their art was soon eclipsed by Abstract Expressionism, the other child of Surrealism.

IDENTITY: Retired chairman of Bloomingdale's; 68-year-old president of Marvin Traub Associates, a consulting and retailing company.    NEW BOOK: \"Like No Other Store . . . The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Evolution in American Marketing,\" (Times Books, $25). The final chapters are devoted to Bloomingdale's period of bankruptcy after Robert Campeau took over its parent, Federated Department Stores, in 1988.    CURRENT CLIENTS: Ralph Lauren, American Express and Saks Fifth Avenue. Marvin Traub Associates also owns Conran's Habitat, the chain of home furnishing stores.    Q.  Do you still shop at Bloomingdale's?    A.  I was there about 10 days ago. I was in the men's store and I ordered some shirts.    Q.  But you don't have to be loyal anymore, do you?   A.  I also shop at Saks as well as Paul Stuart. When I was at Bloomingdale's, 90 percent of my purchases were there, as were Mrs. Traub's. I had a rule: she could shop anyplace she wanted as long as she bought at Bloomingdale's.   Q.  What have you been up to since leaving in 1991?    A.  I've worked with QVC. I originally took Diane Von Furstenburg to QVC, as I say in the book, and through Diane, Barry Diller became very much involved. I've brought a number of different projects to them, including Barbara Taylor Bradford. When it was a great success, the folks at QVC said, \"Marvin, when your book comes out, we'll work together with you on it.\"   Q.  So you're planning to go on the air to sell it?   A.  Yes. It will probably happen sometime in early December.    Q.  Hasn't QVC had too much hype though?   A.  It's interesting to think that the total volume of QVC, Home Shopping Network and all the infomercials that are made is a little more than 15 percent of J. C. Penney's sales. It is a very tiny business, but it will grow. It will not replace people going into department stores or shopping centers.   Q.  What else are you doing?   A.  We started a business with Elizabeth Taylor for costume jewelry, which Avon is making. It's being launched this month. We have another company we started up with Iman, the model. We are doing a line of cosmetics and skin care for women of color.    Q.  What do you think of the direction of Bloomingdale's since you left?   A.  I think I have made it plain in the book that I have a concern that Bloomingdale's maintain a level of uniqueness that excited people to shop there. I know there's an enormous profit pressure that makes it hard to do either a country promotion or some major new idea.    Q.  What do you mean \"concern\"?    A.  The emphasis is on other things. I'm being very measured because I really don't want to seem like sour grapes.    Q.  You do say in the book that you didn't like Michael Gould, your successor as chairman.    A.  Mike was not my first choice for the job, but Mike does have the job, so I'd like him to be successful. For the sake of all the people there and everything we've built.    Q.  You don't mince words about Robert Campeau either. You even imply that he cheats at golf.    A.  He was just driven to win at most any cost. He had some sound ideas and some excesses.    Q.  Having once tried to lead a management buyout of Bloomingdale's, are you disappointedthat you don't own the store?   A.  No. I loved running Bloomingdale's, but with this new second career I am as busy as I've ever been.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"The Renaissance Of an Art Form","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/coins-the-renaissance-of-an-art-form.html","abstract":"  MEDALLIC sculpture began as an art form in Europe during the Renaissance, but since then it's never risen to a position of much prominence.

But its compact mix of west coast harbors and east side sand, with forest trails, volcanic pinnacles, waterfalls and damp gorges in between, make it a favorite among New Zealanders, who consider it one of their most scenic regions. That endorsement -- impressive considering the country's better-known contenders -- led my husband, Gregory Foote, and me to the peninsula eight years ago, when we stopped for a few days in New Zealand on a two-month round-the-world blitz. We were newlyweds, traveling light; but this year, on our third trip to New Zealand, the peninsula's proximity to Auckland -- about a two-hour drive away -- made it a prime draw for us and our two little boys.

The city's historic center is one of the biggest in Europe, and the only one where bomb damage from World War II is still to be found. Heaps of decaying garbage molder next to heaps of decaying stone; crumbling churches and palaces punctuate the Levantine hurly-burly of street markets with their piles of brilliantly colored fish and vegetables, their canvas awnings framing a medieval tower or the iron gratings of a 17th-century convent; dark and lonely alleys are crisscrossed by wooden beams that prop up tottering houses where -- often despite doors sealed by the town government -- clandestine immigrants from the third world exercise squatters' rights.   Cautious tourists dart in from the main thoroughfares just far enough and long enough to visit the neighborhood's churches and museums; food enthusiasts brave the push-and-shove to admire the spectacular displays of the markets and ponder the unfamiliar produce; the adventurous attempt to pursue an itinerary through the maze of narrow streets, or simply wander where they fancy. But everyone, whether fueled by esthetic, gastronomic or sociological curiosity, comes up against padlocked gates and unanswered questions. It is not easy to understand the centro storico's present state, still less to see where its future might lie.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Schools Battle Wide Disparity In Curriculums","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/nyregion/schools-battle-wide-disparity-in-curriculums.html","abstract":"  Maria Lugo's switch this fall from a Brooklyn elementary school to one in Manhattan was not easy.

The I.R.A. seemed to give its answer in October when it bombed a fish shop in a Protestant area of Belfast, killing 10 people. When Protestant gunmen retaliated by killing Catholics, there were a half-dozen more funerals; it was the worst carnage in years in British-ruled Northern Ireland.    On its face, this reciprocal violence appeared to doom a new peace initiative aimed at drawing Sinn Fein and its leader, Gerry Adams, into talks. But the Belfast bombing deceptively obscured deep divisions and a pervasive battle-weariness even within the I.R.A.

NEW YORK CITY  CABDRIVER KILLINGS LEAVE EMPTINESS   Rene Rodriguez, who is 7 years old and proud of learning to rhyme words, insists that he does not keep going to the window to look for a father who never comes. His 10-year-old sister says he does. When the father died behind the wheel of his livery cab in central Harlem in March 1992, he left behind a wife and three children and not much else. He was one of 186 cabdrivers killed in the last five years. The fundamental equation is that $75, the average take in a livery cab robbery, is worth a driver's life to the ones who kill them. But to the families of those slain, almost always poor immigrants, the loss is incalculable. A1.

The aide, Lonna Hooks, said she was never told to offer the ministers any money or to suggest what they should say from the pulpit. Instead, she said, her efforts to win black voters to Mrs. Whitman involved bringing Mrs. Whitman to meet black community leaders and ministers and arranging for her to talk with delegates to the annual meeting of the N.A.A.C.P. During this time, she said, the Florio campaign was largely ignoring black voters and their concerns. A1.

Mark Chesnutt, who performed on Thursday night at Tramps, tries a little of each. His honey-cured baritone is at home in honky-tonk songs about drinking away the pain of a breakup or getting through the morning after the binge. But he also dispenses sentimental ballads and Billy Joel-style bombast. And even in traditionalist country and Cajun songs, his band members pose, swinging their guitars in synch, like video-trained arena rockers; they even brought strobe lights to Tramps.    The country side of Mr. Chesnutt's repertory comes from Nashville's better song factories, turning phrases like \"All my old flames have new names\" and \"My heart's too broke to pay attention.\" Like nearly every other cowboy-hatted young male country singer, Mr. Chesnutt emulates George Jones and Merle Haggard. He sounds appropriately mournful and rueful in songs of barroom self-pity, and his unaccompanied version of \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" captured the song's despondent longing. But despite his considerable skills, and his band's rangy drive, Mr. Chesnutt projects little individuality; he seems determined to cast himself as a simple, stereotyped, lovesick good old boy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931122","headline":"Review/Theater: Cyrano: The Musical; Cyrano's Flights Have Touched Down On West 52d Street","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/22/theater/review-theater-cyrano-musical-cyrano-s-flights-have-touched-down-west-52d-street.html","abstract":"  Credit the many people involved in turning \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" from a lyrical, swashbuckling French play into a Dutch musical into a $7 million English-language musical with at least one success: its plot is as easy to follow as a synopsis laid out in Cliffs Notes.

Under a so-called \"package deal,\" the United States will offer a series of small concessions and larger promises of future aid to North Korea -- and steps toward diplomatic recognition -- in return for immediate, limited inspections of its nuclear sites.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931122","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/22/us/c-corrections-899693.html","abstract":"  An article on Nov. 11 about the World Trade Center bombing trial misstated the location of the Fort Bragg military base, which was apparently the source of an instruction manual that prosecutors say one defendant was carrying.
