A1. THE NEW HEALTH CARE CZAR It is perhaps a logical career move for a political bungee jumper.

Mr. Sekiguchi is the first real business contact corralled by New York State economic development officials to test a program to increase exports by black-owned businesses to Japan. B3.

STABBINGS ATTRIBUTED TO 'RUDENESS' After stabbing a man who was walking with his wife and son in Midtown Manhattan, a Brooklyn man confessed to the crime and two other stabbings, saying that he was moved to attack people because of their rudeness, the police said.

Cutting 3,800 Residencies?    The New York hospitals say they share the Administration's goal: to lower overall costs and train more of the nation's doctors in basic care. But because about 15 percent of the country's medical residents are now trained in New York State, the hospitals say any changes could affect New York disproportionately.

Those fires burning so brightly in the background of so many televised White House gatherings appeared to Mr. Cranberg to result not from the interaction of wood and match but of match and gas jet. The gas flames then play over simulated logs of ceramic or concrete to create \"a fake wood fire,\" he conjectured. If the White House needed coaching in building a true wood fire -- the kind that warms the soul as well as the feet -- he, Lawrence Cranberg, stood at the ready.   Mr. Cranberg's letter promptly ignited an Administration response. The White House has 27 fireplaces, a deputy press secretary said, and they all burn wood. Furthermore, they all draw beautifully. Not for the Clintons and their predecessors, the sudden billow of smoke, the float of ash and the coat of soot that are the occasional lot of most fireplace owners.

This makes it slightly worse than 50 percent, and in this situation one needs slightly better than that to justify the attempt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/arts/classical-music-in-review-979651.html","abstract":"  I Musici   Avery Fisher Hall    There is something paradoxical about I Musici, the conductorless chamber orchestra founded in Rome 42 years ago.

The data, from spacecraft meant to watch for rocket firings and nuclear explosions, were declassified recently by the Defense Department and are to appear later this year in a book.    From 1975 to 1992, the satellites detected 136 explosions high in the atmosphere, an average of eight a year. The blasts are calculated to have intensities roughly equal to 500 to 15,000 tons of high explosive, or the power of small atomic bombs. Experts who have analyzed the data are publishing it in the book, \"Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids,\" say that the detection rate is probably low and that the actual bombardment rate might be 10 times higher, with 80 or so blasts occurring each year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Tennis Center Scores Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/sports/tennis-tennis-center-scores-again.html","abstract":"  The controversial plans for the $180 million expansion of the National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park have survived another hurdle by incurring no legal suits during a four-month period that followed the project's Sept. 23 acceptance by the City Council.

For by then Mr. Shaw, in his inimitably earthy manner, had presided over a weeklong humanistic exercise of the highest order.   It didn't seem so at the start. The first rehearsals of the adult chorus, last Tuesday at the Manhattan Center in midtown, struck an observer who has always admired Mr. Shaw's results as oddly mechanistic affairs. Mr. Shaw's method is to isolate aspects of the music: rhythm, for example, through the singing of beat numbers instead of text; or enunciation, with words chanted on a single pitch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Knicks Not Equal to the Sum of Their Parts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-not-equal-to-the-sum-of-their-parts.html","abstract":"  Charles Smith is back.

Like many forgetful natives and startled visitors, he discovered the fearfulness California can display -- a combination of the sublime and the apocalyptic sufficient to sharpen anyone's sense of an ending.\n\nAnything sublime is terrifying, and anyone who lives in California must sometimes suspect a connection beyond the obvious between the sublimity of the landscape and the terrible events, natural disasters and human calamities it so often witnesses.\n\nCzeslaw Milosz, the Nobel Prizewinner in literature, questioned in a 1980 essay whether anybody belongs in California. Its spirit of place seems intolerant of mere mankind, he said.\n\nThe sense of an ending that broods over the land, especially in Southern California, has preoccupied our best California writers, from Mark Twain to Joan Didion, not to mention opinionated tourists like Henry James and Umberto Eco. But is this eerie sensation a property of the land, some combination of freakish weather and violent, moody geology that communicates itself? Or is it society, equally freakish, projecting itself onto the landscape? Southern California, after all, is a vast polyglot city-state dependent for its water, power and labor on a vast and far-reaching infra structural web whose fragility is devastatingly apparent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"STATE OF THE UNION: The Republicans; In G.O.P.

There is even subversive social comment in the uneasily casual relationship between the Count and his retainers. Add to that some top-drawer Mozart, with hardly a wasted gesture in either the vocal or the orchestral writing, and you have a work that should be a high point of the opera season.   Those considerable joys are tempered at the Metropolitan Opera, where Figaro and his friends enact their drama in the resolutely ugly sets that Jean-Pierre Ponnelle designed in 1985. When the production returned to the house on Monday evening, an interestingly balanced cast and astute conducting by Julius Rudel afforded ample musical pleasures. But it was difficult to avoid either the distractions of the production or, on a cheerier note, the thought that each season carries its crumbling pillars and archways, its unrealistically placed portals and its drab costumes closer to the trash heap.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/nyregion/metro-digest-984540.html","abstract":"  RENO TO PURSUE CROWN HTS.

It goes without saying that stage pieces like \"Mahagonny\" and \"The Threepenny Opera\" made Weill famous in a way that his earlier pursuit of the classical European tradition never would have.   The Quartet smoothly masters old ideas: stretched tonality, imitations of previous forms, studious use of imitative counterpoint and even some impudent use of different meters and speeds playing against one another.  But imbedded in these textures is the signature that was to be read more clearly in just a few years. Popular dance rhythms and balladlike melodies are among them. Listen carefully and you will also hear Weill's celebration of the march, used here with characteristic bitterness and humor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"A Culture of Clique : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/opinion/IHT-a-culture-of-clique-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"A Destructive Culture of Critique\" (Opinion, Jan. 18) by Deborah Tannen and \"Shouting at One Another in Lieu of Useful Debate\" (Opinion, Jan. 20) by William Pfaff:.Has the press really gotten nastier over the past few yea","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"The Biggest Dragon : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/opinion/IHT-the-biggest-dragon-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Don't Trust the Reports of Superheated Growth\" (Opinion, Jan. 19) by Christopher Lingle and Kurt Wickman:.The authors, senior fellows in European affairs at Singapore University, question the accuracy of World Bank estimates of Chi","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/us/inside-984370.html","abstract":"  A Growing Power in Russia   Prime Minister Viktor S.
