In eight patients treated so far, five responded markedly to the therapy, their brain tumors either shrinking or showing signs that tumor cells were dying.

The great interest of Robin Phillips's emotionally gripping, if somewhat muddled, production at the Stratford Festival here is that it makes John its unconditional center and, in doing so, presents him as a disturbingly pertinent statesman for our times. \"Macbeth\" and \"Richard III,\" with their portraits of raveningly ambitious, Machiavellian heads of state, were the perfect choices for politically slanted revivals in the paranoiac heyday of the late 60's and early 70's, the years of Johnson and Nixon. \"King John,\" on the other hand, has vital resonance for an age that often sees its politicians less as monsters than mediocrities, distanced from greatness by all-too-pedestrian frailties.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"Another Despotic Creed Seeks to Infiltrate the West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/opinion/IHT-another-despotic-creed-seeks-to-infiltrate-the-west.html","abstract":"Muslim fundamentalism is fast becoming the chief threat to global peace and security as well as a cause of national and local disturbance through terrorism.

At the Academy on Tuesday night, the crowd sustained the tune of \"Let Love Rule\" while Mr. Kravitz demanded more gusto. \"Ya gotta mean it!\" he shouted, a particularly odd request from a performer so dedicated to posing.    The 28-year-old Mr. Kravitz is a proud throwback. He reclaims rock from the late 1960's and early 1970's, and he steals only from the best: the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Marvin Gaye. (Meanwhile, the opening act for his tour, Raging Slab, revives the Southern hard-rock of the mid-1970's.) Yet Mr. Kravitz still lives in the music-video era, and for him the golden age of rock means the right props and costumes: old guitars and keyboards, bell-bottomed pants, untamed hairdos and postures of artless sincerity, perhaps learned from repeated viewings of the \"Woodstock\" videotape. \"We're just gonna play,\" he said as one tune stretched out, alluding to a late-1960's Hendrix disclaimer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/nyregion/metro-digest-430393.html","abstract":"  ATTORNEY GENERAL ABRAMS TO RESIGN   The New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, his hopes of winning a Senate seat dashed last year and his prospects for the governorship apparently stymied, abruptly announced that he would resign the post that he has held for 15 years to become a partner in a Manhattan law firm at the end of the year.

Ms. King, who is playing a rare New York engagement, has always been a compellingly open-hearted performer. With her vigorous pop-gospel piano and Brooklyn-style \"natural woman\" voice, she projects an unimpeachable honesty, earthiness and musical integrity. Expect to hear many of her standards of the 1960's and 70's, along with selections from her recent album, \"Color of Your Dreams,\" in which her singing and songwriting talents seem firmly intact. Shows are at 8 tonight and tomorrow night. Tickets: $35. Laura Nyro Now    Laura Nyro, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Aspects of this introspective singer and songwriter's personality that might have seemed eccentric in the late 1960's and early 70's have coalesced into a lyrical sensibility that could be described as a radical feminist earth mother. Her musical style has changed little over the years. On her new album, \"Walk the Dog and Lite the Lite,\" it is anchored in doo-wop ballads filtered through Philadelphia soul and trimmed with Broadway. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 11.

A star since 1973, he sings material by the cream of Brazil's songwriters, among them Caetano Veloso, Milton Nascimento and Jorge Ben.

She has not given up on young musicians. Now the concerts she presents on her 94-year-old coffee barge feature ensembles that bring together seasoned performers and talented newcomers.

This conflict fuels his vibrant Expressionist canvases, which sometimes seem about to dance off the walls at the Andre Emmerich Gallery on 57th Street, even while it also renders some of them naggingly unresolved. And this same ambivalence may also have set Jorn restlessly exploring painting's periphery. There, as the non-Expressionist works at Emmerich suggest, he edged into appropriation in ways that make him seem almost prototypically post-modern, a precursor to Sigmar Polke and other stylistically polymorphous painters of today.   Jorn was active, perhaps overactive, in the postwar European art world. He wrote almost compulsively on art and theory (usually from a Marxist stance), lived in Paris and northern Italy as well as in Denmark, and was part of several of the shifting, short-lived art movements that characterized his time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930910","headline":"Talks With Union Continue at The Post","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/nyregion/talks-with-union-continue-at-the-post.html","abstract":"  The union representing news, advertising and circulation employees reported minor progress in contract talks with The New York Post late last night and said it had suspended a strike threat and agreed to continue negotiations with the bankrupt tabloid today and over the weekend.   \"Our intention is to continue bargaining until we have a contract,\" Barry F.

With minimal government subsidies for the arts, which now represent less than 10 percent of the festival's budget, and a discouraging 7 percent increase in ticket prices dictated by Canada's grumble-provoking Goods and Services Tax, the Stratford Festival, which runs a narrowing but continuing deficit, has got to get a very big audience. And the ecdysiast is right: to get that audience -- particularly after repeated productions of the Shakespearean standards that made the festival's name -- you gotta have that gimmick, or, indeed, many gimmicks.   It represents no small achievement that the festival can report that it will probably take in its largest box-office grosses ever this year. While this season offers none of the stars with guaranteed drawing power -- Alec Guinness, James Mason, Maggie Smith and Brian Bedford -- who have trodden the boards here in years past, the festival has inaugurated several popular discount programs. Its gift shop is well stocked with groovy-classical T-shirts (one, showing Shakespeare in sunglasses, reads \"Rebel with applause\"), coffee mugs and umbrellas. And in his last year as artistic director here, David William, who will be succeeded by Richard Monette, has carefully created a something-for-everyone schedule of plays. They are clearly intended for an audience, a majority of which comes from within a 150-mile radius, that Janice Price, the director of marketing and communications, admits is innately conservative.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930910","headline":"Restaurants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/arts/restaurants-174793.html","abstract":"  In Japan an expensive object is prized because of its price.

The buckwheat noodles known as soba have been eaten in Japan for 400 years. As soba restaurants multiplied, the Japanese urge for perfection set in, and soba masters began competing to see who could make the purest soba. This is not easy. Buckwheat is extremely nutritious, but it resists turning into malleable dough. Ordinary soba noodles are made mostly of wheat: to make pure buckwheat noodles that do not shatter and crack apart requires the hand of a true master. The Japanese say it takes a year just to learn to mix the dough, another year to learn to roll it, a third to learn the correct cut. The soba chefs at Honmura An have clearly put in their time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930910","headline":"Abbott Can't Afford to Look Back in Pleasure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/sports/baseball-abbott-can-t-afford-to-look-back-in-pleasure.html","abstract":"  Jim Abbott jogged around Arlington Stadium in the oppressive Texas heat Monday afternoon, soaking his gray T-shirt and trying to complete a cleansing process.

The letters were provided by Mr. Rabin's office. Rabin to Arafat  Sept. 9, 1993    Mr. Chairman,   In response to your letter of Sept. 9, 1993, I wish to confirm to you that in light of the P.L.O. commitments included in your letter the Government of Israel has decided to recognize the P.L.O. as the representative of the Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the P.L.O. within the Middle East peace process. YITZHAK RABIN   Prime Minister of Israel Arafat to Rabin  Sept. 9, 1993    Mr. Prime Minister,   The signing of the Declaration of Principles marks a new era in the history of the Middle East. In firm conviction thereof, I would like to confirm the following P.L.O. commitments:    The P.L.O. recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.    The P.L.O. accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.   The P.L.O. commits itself to the Middle East peace process and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.    The P.L.O. considers that the signing of the Declaration of Principles constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly, the P.L.O. renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all P.L.O. elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent violations and discipline violators.   In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the P.L.O. affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the P.L.O. undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant. Sincerely, YASIR ARAFAT  Chairman Palestine Liberation Organization Arafat to Holst Sept. 9, 1993    Dear Minister Holst,    I would like to confirm to you that upon the signing of the Declaration of Principles I will include the following positions in my public statements:    In light of the new era marked by the signing of the Declaration of Principles the P.L.O. encourages and calls upon the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to take part in the steps leading to the normalization of life, rejecting violence and terrorism, contributing to peace and stability and participating actively in shaping reconstruction, economic development and cooperation.
