A one-year Government income tax surcharge to help pay the costs of absorbing the formerly Communist part of the country apparently led many people to take another look at their finances and give up the church.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19921228","headline":"Am I Mad, or Is This My Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/28/opinion/am-i-mad-or-is-this-my-life.html","abstract":"On Aug. 5, I waited in a line seven miles long for a ferry to take me and my family to the Island of Pag.

North took a shot at four spades, and East had to decide whether to save in five hearts. That contract would obviously have failed by one trick, and did in the replay.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921228","headline":"Barbara F.

The New York Chamber Symphony, under the leadership of Jaime Laredo, makes the experience quite painless. The group has made a sturdy holiday tradition out of the cycle; it was, in fact, first formed in 1976 for this purpose. The performances on Sunday afternoon at the 92d Street Y were not perfect, but neither was creation.   The performance began with the First, Third and Fifth Concertos. The ensemble seemed imprecise at the outset, but the playing had a warm glow of enthusiasm that overcame doubts about preparedness. John Van Buskirk negotiated the harpsichord solos of the Fifth with a facility that fell short of brilliance, but the basic idea came across. While Mr. Laredo's leadership lacked the forward-driving momentum of modern original-instrument performances, it seldom dawdled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921229","headline":"Clinton Delays Trip To Work, Pack Up And Fill More Jobs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/us/clinton-delays-trip-to-work-pack-up-and-fill-more-jobs.html","abstract":"  Pressed by the lofty concerns of assembling a Government and the more mundane business of packing up a house, President-elect Bill Clinton delayed a planned weeklong vacation to the South Carolina coast today to stay home and work.
