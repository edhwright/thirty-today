That is the frightening message of Walter Laqueur's revealing new book, \"Black Hundred.\"    To the inchoate groups on the extreme right who are increasingly influential in the political and social life of Russia, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin are considered enemies of the state. The new nationalistic superpatriots are opposed to rapprochement with the West. Anti-Americanism is very much present in the anti-democratic language used by leaders of the extremist parties.

Analysis of Criminal Investigation    Several people were responsible for the stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum. Only Lemrick Nelson was indicted, tried and acquitted. Deficiencies in the initial investigation created problems with the evidence which subsequent efforts did not overcome. Accordingly, the likelihood that other participants in the attack on Rosenbaum will be held accountable for the murder has been greatly diminished.                    . . .         The improper handling of critical physical evidence compromised its probative value at trial. The bloodstained knife discovered on Nelson, which should have provided persuasive proof in support of the prosecution's case, was not properly handled. Additionally, Nelson's pants could have provided meaningful evidence of his involvement in the attack on Rosenbaum. The stains on the pants should have been properly noted and analyzed by the police. Tests on this evidence were not sufficiently monitored by the prosecution. The Jury's View of the Case    Considering the problems with the evidence presented by the prosecution, there was an ample basis for the jury verdict finding that the people had not proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The reasonable doubts articulated by the jurors arose, to a greater extent, from the inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony and deficiencies in the evidence.                    . . .         During the course of the interviews with the jurors, two themes emerged for why the jury determined that Nelson was not guilty. These themes can be characterized as inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony and as deficiencies in the evidence.                    . . .         The jurors found that the inconsistencies in the police officers' testimony were an overriding consideration in undermining the value of all key prosecution evidence, and in finding that Nelson was not guilty of stabbing Rosenbaum. The prosecution's late discovery of key witnesses exacerbated this problem.   Most significantly, the inconsistencies in the police officers' testimony regarding Nelson's apprehension, Rosenbaum's identification and Nelson's confession seriously compromised the value of this evidence in the eyes of the jury. The jurors had been instructed by Judge Rappaport to evaluate whether the witnesses were truthful in order to determine the facts of the case. The jurors stated that, after considering these factors, they determined that they could not reconcile the contradictory evidence and the inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses. As a result, they disregarded the testimony of some of the main police witnesses whose statements were crucial to proving Nelson's guilt.   The manner in which the Judge conducted the trial appeared to have influenced the jury's decision-making.   Although many of the jurors seemed to have a favorable view of the Judge, his remarks and conduct may have adversely affected their view about the credibility of the police witnesses. He was unable to control the conduct and the comments of the defense counsel, which afforded the jury an opportunity to consider information that was otherwise irrelevant or inadmissible. Further, by continuously interjecting himself in the questioning of witnesses, the jury had concerns regarding the Judge's impartiality. Most significantly, the Judge's reaction to Officer Lewis's testimony highlighted the inconsistencies between Lewis's version of the events surrounding Nelson's apprehension and the version of Officers Hoppe and Marinos and Detective Litwin. The Judge did not remain an impartial arbitrator and instead conveyed to the jury his personal opinions about the evidence.                    . . .       From the Findings    * The failure to record the identities of the individuals present at the scene made it difficult to identify police and civilian witnesses.   * Interviews with the victim and possible suspects were not conducted promptly or recorded.   * The improper handling of critical physical evidence compromised its probative value at trial. The bloodstained knife discovered on Nelson, which should have provided persuasive proof in support of the prosecution's case, was not properly handled. Additionally, Nelson's pants could have provided meaningful evidence of his involvement in the attack on Rosenbaum. The stains on the pants should have been properly noted and analyzed by the police. Tests on this evidence were not sufficiently monitored by the prosecution.   * The jurors found that the inconsistencies in the police officers' testimony were an overriding consideration in undermining the value of all key prosecution evidence, and in finding that Nelson was not guilty of stabbing Rosenbaum. The prosecution's late discovery of key witnesses exacerbated this problem.   * The manner in which the Judge conducted the trial appeared to have influenced the jury's decision-making.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930721","headline":"Dodgers Pressing Fight on Brooklyn Bar's Name","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/21/nyregion/dodgers-pressing-fight-on-brooklyn-bar-s-name.html","abstract":"  The attack of the Los Angeles Dodgers on a little bar in Brooklyn is continuing.

Analysis of Decisions    The report, commissioned by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and overseen by Richard H. Girgenti, the state's Director of Criminal Justice, determined that there was no evidence to support the most extreme charges that have dogged the Mayor since the Crown Heights violence in August 1991: that he or his Police Commissioner at the time, Lee P. Brown, had instructed the police to let marauding youths \"vent\" their rage after a 7-year-old black child was killed by an out-of-control car driven by a Hasidic man.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930721","headline":"Change at the Top for the F.B.I.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/21/opinion/change-at-the-top-for-the-fbi.html","abstract":"  President Clinton finally ended the damaging stalemate over the F.B.I.'s leadership when he dismissed William Sessions, the amiable, proud but ultimately ineffective Director.

From Executive Summary Planning                    . . .         The department's Disorder Control Plans provided a solid basis for guiding its response to the disturbance. However, the plans were not updated annually as required, did not provide an explicit mission statement, nor make clear when they were to be invoked. These plans were not used until Thursday, when the strategy adopted mirrored the principles of the Patrol Borough Brooklyn South Unusual Disorder Plan.                    . . .       Mobilization and Tactics    The mobilization and deployment of officers to the accident scene occurred too slowly to prevent the spread of the disturbance.   Violence erupted at President Street and Utica Avenue soon after the 8:20 P.M. accident. By 9 P.M., 911 callers had reported a riot in the area and the police began to mobilize. However, at first, the response was limited to officers responding to radio calls, about 30 officers stationed at a nearby concert, and the Brooklyn South Task Force. However, 270 of the approximately 400 officers ultimately assigned did not arrive until after 11:30 P.M., and full mobilization was not completed until between 1 and 2:40 A.M.   Because of the slow pace of mobilization, the officers were not in position to control the unruly mob at the accident scene. The mob began to stream down President Street at 11 P.M., shattering windows and damaging cars. Lemrick Nelson, who was acquitted of murdering Yankel Rosenbaum, told detectives he was part of that crowd. Deployment was not completed until sometime between 1 A.M. and 2:40 A.M., at least four hours after the police saw the disturbance at the intersection of President and Utica escalate into violence.                    . . .         The officers in Crown Heights lacked a clear understanding of their mission. While the field commander initially ordered officers to exercise restraint, he was unprepared to alter their tactics when that approach failed.   Initially, Chief Gallagher emphasized restraint, fearing that aggressive action would exacerbate already strong feelings and make the police the focus of the crowd's anger. This approach failed to spell out proactive steps. Containment and dispersal were not consistently implemented, and no other tactical options were substituted.   As a result, field supervisors were forced to improvise or remain passive when restraint failed. The department's response to the first three nights of violence was, consequently, uncoordinated and ineffective.                    . . .         Prior to Thursday, most of the police were deployed to fixed posts, an ineffective way to prevent illegal activity by roving bands.   Because the police were deployed at fixed posts, roving bands were able to move through the neighborhood. These roving bands committed violent acts and moved elsewhere before the police could respond. The Police Department's failure to control roving bands contributed significantly to the riotous character of the disturbance.   On Thursday, the department supplemented its fixed-post strategy with mobile patrols assigned to cover these roving bands. Exhibiting a high degree of coordination, the police ordered these bands to disperse when they became unruly and to arrest people who refused to comply. This approach was successful.   N.Y.P.D. undertook extensive community intervention efforts to mediate hostilities and to thwart rumors contributing to the unrest in Crown Heights.   Community intervention was a significant aspect of the Police Department's response to the Crown Heights disturbance. Several rumors spread throughout the community shortly after the fatal accident. They helped to fuel the anger and deepen the division between blacks and Hasidim. The police repeatedly attempted to dispel the rumors through public meetings and press conferences.   Efforts were made at all levels, from Police Commissioner to the borough commander to community affairs officers, to communicate with the black and Hasidic communities, starting Monday evening. Commissioner Brown, the Mayor and Deputy Mayors and leaders of the community quickly gathered that night at the 71st Precinct. They saw the need to work together to try to calm the situation. Brown requested that community leaders be briefed to help them quell rumors and encourage public order.                    . . .       Command and Control    There was no evidence of an affirmative order by the Police Commissioner to prevent the police from responding to criminal incidents in Crown Heights.   The Police Commissioner and other members of the command structure stated that at no time did they order officers not to make arrests. Commissioner Brown stated: \"I know there was no policy from my level, and I haven't heard anyone below me say that they may have ordered a no-arrest policy.\" Assistant Chief Gallagher, Deputy Chief Gussman and other commanding officers echoed this contention.   Commissioner Brown said his expectation was that arrests would be made for violations of the law where the police were capable of doing so. Assistant Chief Gallagher said police officers were instructed not to take independent action and to stay on their posts to protect the assigned areas. The assignment of most officers to fixed posts and the relative absence of mobile patrols, however, made it more difficult to effectuate arrests.   Personnel changes within the department in early August 1991 placed two key officials in positions and weakened the command structure.   Effective Aug. 15, 1991, the chief of department, Robert Johnston, retired. On Monday, August 19, the new chief of department, David W. Scott, went on a previously scheduled vacation. Chief of detectives, Joseph Borrelli, was named to assume interim duties as acting chief of department. Mario Selvaggi was appointed that day to be chief of patrol. With Selvaggi and Borrelli serving in less than familiar roles, the command structure was weakened. They were inclined to accept the information and plans they received rather than adopting more assertive roles.   A collective failure by top-ranking N.Y.P.D. officials delayed the implementation of appropriate tactics to control this disorder.   Many of our criticisms of the police response to the disturbances are negative judgments about the performance of high-level N.Y.P.D. officials. The Police Department clearly had sufficient resources and knowhow to deal more swiftly and effectively with the disturbance. The individuals who occupied the highest positions in the department must share accountability for its failure to do so before Thursday.   Effective supervision requires that the headquarters command staff insist upon the development of sound tactical objectives, monitor the actions taken by the field commander and judge the effectiveness of those efforts. Commissioner Brown and others should have intervened when a change in tactics was warranted. Instead, the department's oversight of field operations was inadequate.                    . . .         The Police Commissioner did not effectively fulfill his ultimate responsibility for managing the department's activities to suppress rioting and preserve the public peace.   The Police Commissioner's fundamental responsibility is to manage the department to meet the public need for police services. Brown asserted that his job was to make sure that his uniformed commanders had the support they needed. He said the decision how to use the police officers, once they were on the scene, was to be made by those in the field. The Commissioner, himself, told us that he thought the commanders handling the situation had sufficient experience and knew what to do. He considered it the responsibility of his staff to identify problems of resources or tactics and bring them to his attention. He did not closely oversee the police response to the disturbance.   In times of emergency, the public can reasonably expect the Police Commissioner to ask probing questions of key aides on the scene, as well as monitor ongoing developments. The Commissioner should assess operational effectiveness and demand changes where needed. There is no evidence that Lee P. Brown provided this kind of leadership during the first three days of disturbances in Crown Heights. Evaluated against these standards, the Commissioner's leadership and performance were inadequate.   Given the seriousness of the disturbances, it is unfortunate that the First Deputy did not assume a role in coordinating the development and implementation of a different strategy sooner.   As an executive aide to the Commissioner, First Deputy Raymond Kelly was assigned various administrative functions. In an interview, now-Commissioner Kelly said it was made clear to him following his appointment that he was to have no role in operations and that the chief of department would report directly to the Commissioner.   Kelly had the authority to intervene in emergency incidents according to the Patrol Guide procedures. However, because he was not formally in the direct chain of command, Kelly had no responsibility for patrol services. Watching events on television Wednesday, Kelly decided on his own initiative to go to Crown Heights. After meeting with Commissioner Brown, a decision was made that tactical changes were needed. Kelly assumed responsibility for devising the new strategy that ultimately restored calm to the area.    It proved to be a critical shortcoming that Commissioner Brown did not call upon Kelly to assume his ultimate role in coordinating the development and implementation of a new strategy. It is regrettable that, under the circumstances, Kelly did not deem it appropriate to seek an active role prior to late Wednesday.                    . . .         Gaps in communication blocked the flow of critical information through the chain of command.  When asked who would have been reporting directly to him about what was going on in Crown Heights, Brown stated that it was Acting Chief of Department Borrelli. Brown said that he received information from whoever had it during the disturbance, but viewed Borrelli as \"the person there who was in charge of everything.\" However, Chief Borrelli said he had little contact with the Commissioner, except for conversations regarding the Rosenbaum homicide and their mutual presence at meetings with the Mayor.   It appears Brown did not receive a comprehensive account of the events on the streets, nor of the tactics used. For instance, when we spoke with him, the former Commissioner was unaware that on Tuesday Chief Gallagher had ordered his officers to take cover for their safety along the building line because they were outnumbered when crowds began throwing rocks and bottles. When we informed Brown about this crucial incident, he agreed that based upon this information, unknown to him at the time, it would have been appropriate for those at the scene to request reinforcements or devise new tactics.                    . . .       911    During the disturbance, Crown Heights residents relied on the 911 system to alert the police to imminent danger. Callers reported attacks on their homes, unruly mobs on the street and assaults in progress. Many of these callers were not well served by the system.   Many 911 calls reporting large bands of angry demonstrators threatening or engaging in property and personal offenses were erroneously incident-coded as \"disorderly group\" or \"criminal mischief.\" Consequently, they were handled as low priority calls.   When a call is made to the 911 system, the operator classifies the reported incident. This generates a priority level, which influences the speed with which the police respond. In many cases, calls reporting large angry bands of people were incorrectly coded as \"disorderly groups,\" or \"criminal mischief.\" These calls receive a relatively low priority rating. A more appropriate classification would have been \"roving band,\" which receives a high priority classification. Despite intense roving band activity, just two calls received that classification.   The erroneous classification of 911 jobs as duplicates denied police services to some callers.   Many calls were also classified as duplicates even though they reported incidents at different locations. This violated departmental guidelines, which require that calls specify the exact same incident in order to be considered duplicated. The heavy use of duplicate classifications prevented some calls from receiving a police response.                    . . .       From the Findings    * The mobilization and deployment of officers to the accident scene occurred too slowly after violence began to limit the spread of the disorder that night.   * The Police Department lacked a clearly defined and articulated mission to guide its response to civil disturbances. The field commander chose a restraint-oriented approach, but failed to direct proactive measures to end the violence.   * Until a proactive-arrest policy was announced and the unlawful assembly statute was used, the police did not effectively prevent disorderly crowds from forming and engaging in acts of violence.   * N.Y.P.D. undertook extensive community intervention efforts to mediate hostilities and to thwart rumors which had contributed to the unrest in Crown Heights.   * There was no evidence of an affirmative order by the Police Commissioner to prevent the police from responding to criminal incidents in Crown Heights.   * A collective failure by top-ranking N.Y.P.D. officials delayed the implementation of appropriate tactics to control the disorder.   * The Police Commissioner did not effectively fulfill his ultimate responsibility for managing the department's activities to suppress rioting and preserve the public peace.   * Gaps in communication blocked the flow of critical information through the chain of command.   * Many 911 calls reporting large bands of angry demonstrators threatening or engaged in property and personal offenses were erroneously incident-coded as \"disorderly group\" or \"criminal mischief.\" Consequently, they were handled as low-priority calls.   * The erroneous classification of 911 jobs as duplicates denied police services to some callers.   * The N.Y.P.D. has made significant improvement since August of 1991 to enhance its planning and training for future disturbances.

Within this zone, the flooded area totaled around 30,000 square miles (78,000 km2) and was the worst such U.S. disaster since the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, as measured by duration, area inundated, persons displaced, crop and property damage, and number of record river levels. In some categories, the 1993 flood even surpassed the 1927 flood, at the time the largest flood ever recorded on the Mississippi River."},{"title":"Levee","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee","description":"Ridge or wall to hold back water","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Sacramento_River_Levee.jpg/320px-Sacramento_River_Levee.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":213},"abstract":"A levee, dike, dyke, embankment, floodbank, or stop bank is a structure that is usually earthen and that often runs parallel to the course of a river in its floodplain or along low-lying coastlines."},{"title":"Kaskaskia, Illinois","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaskaskia%2C_Illinois","description":"Village in Illinois, United States","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Kaskaskia_Church.jpg/320px-Kaskaskia_Church.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":213},"abstract":"Kaskaskia is a village in Randolph County, Illinois. Having been inhabited by indigenous peoples, it was settled by France as part of the Illinois Country. It was named for the Kaskaskia people. Its population peaked at about 7,000 in the 18th century, when it was a regional center. During the American Revolutionary War, the town, which by then had become an administrative center for the British Province of Quebec, was taken by the Virginia militia during the Illinois campaign. It was designated as the county seat of Illinois County, Virginia, after which it became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787. Kaskaskia was later named as the capital of the United States' Illinois Territory, created on February 3, 1809. In 1818, when Illinois became the 21st U.S. state, the town briefly served as the state's first capital until 1819, when the capital was moved to more centrally located Vandalia."},{"title":"United States Army Corps of Engineers","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers","description":"United States federal agency under the Department of Defense and a major Army command","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/USACE.gif/320px-USACE.gif","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":320},"abstract":"The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an engineer formation of the United States Army that has three primary mission areas: Engineer Regiment, military construction, and civil works. The day-to-day activities of the three mission areas are administered by a lieutenant general known as the commanding general/chief of engineers. The chief of engineers commands the Engineer Regiment, comprising combat engineer, rescue, construction, dive, and other specialty units, and answers directly to the Chief of Staff of the Army. Combat engineers, sometimes called sappers, form an integral part of the Army's combined arms team and are found in all Army service components: Regular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve. Their duties are to breach obstacles; construct fighting positions, fixed/floating bridges, and obstacles and defensive positions; place and detonate explosives; conduct route clearance operations; emplace and detect landmines; and fight as provisional infantry when required. For the military construction mission, the commanding general is directed and supervised by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for installations, environment, and energy, whom the President appoints and the Senate confirms. Military construction relates to construction on military bases and worldwide installations."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930722","time":"1993-07-22

It happened 10 years ago when he was invited to give a series of master classes at Harvard University and found that his students were eager to know about the big-band era, which had ended more than 35 years earlier. Drawing on his experience as a sideman in the big bands led by Lionel Hampton, Cab Calloway and Count Basie, Mr. Jacquet put together the band he has led ever since.

At the same time, for 18 of those years she was producing elevator and supermarket music for Muzak until, in the late 1970's, she dropped these disguises and revealed herself as a jazz pianist strongly influenced by Mary Lou Williams, Earl Hines and Duke Ellington. When she got her first engagement at Zinno 10 years ago, the celebrated bassist Milt Hinton joined her. He has been with her for many of her engagements there for the past decade. They will be together once more tonight and tomorrow; the first of their four 40-minute sets begins at 8 P.M. There is a music charge of $5 and a food and drink minimum of $15 in the Music Room, where dinner is served, and a $10 drink minimum at the bar.  Guises of Golson    Benny Golson Quartet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, East Village (212) 533-7900. Benny Golson moves fast and frequently and in a variety of guises. He is a saxophonist, a composer, a band leader and a writer of scores for films and television, talents that are usually mingled in whatever he may be doing. This weekend at Fat Tuesday's, he will draw to some extent on all of his talents. He will not actually compose a film or television score but his program may include material he wrote for scores for \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Mission Impossible\" or \"Ironside\"; songs he wrote or arranged for Ella Fitzgerald, Mama Cass, Eartha Kitt and Diana Ross, and his now-classic jazz compositions (\"I Remember Clifford,\" \"Whisper Not\" and \"Stablemates\"). And he will introduce the latest in a line of groups that began in 1959, when he shared leadership in the Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet. This one is a quartet featuring a fresh talent, Kevin Hayes, on piano, and two solidly established sidemen: the bassist Rufus Reid and the drummer Marvin (Smitty) Smith. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight, 8 and 10 P.M. on Sunday. There is a $17.50 music charge and a $7 minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930723","headline":"Reviews/Art; In Connecticut, Clothes, Photos and a Yale on Yale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/arts/reviews-art-in-connecticut-clothes-photos-and-a-yale-on-yale.html","abstract":"  From Stamford to Hartford and at points in between, the summer art season in Connecticut includes a provocative look at contemporary art that uses clothing as a metaphor, an examination of the influence of the 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge, a celebration of an important university art program and a consideration of the work of an American master.

That proposition would make Suffolk one of only a handful of municipalities in the country with a public financing law intended to lessen the influence of special interests.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930723","headline":"Free Trade's Fine, as Long as It's Really Free; Environmental Weapon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/opinion/l-free-trade-s-fine-as-long-as-it-s-really-free-environmental-weapon-184793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   On most days, your editorials advocate international cooperation and agreement, and at least once a week you call attention to the proper allocation of functions of our national government.

Anyone in the neighborhood of the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers in Manhattan by day, or outside many of the city's rock clubs at night, can expect to see crowds of well-scrubbed music moguls in training, with their laminated seminar passes around their necks, hanging over T-shirts chosen to make that indelible first impression.    The seminar, which runs through tomorrow, offers discussions of commerce and issues by day and dozens of bands by night. For the approximately 7,000 people who have bought full passes, at up to $380 each, it's an educational update, a job fair, a talent bazaar and a place to make contacts. For fans who haven't made music their business, the fact that the seminar is in town brings an opportunity this weekend to hear a plethora of bands, as clubs switch from double bills to quadruple and quintuple ones. And for all concerned, the seminar is the place to try out the latest pop jargon, whether discussing styles of music or ways to turn them into profit centers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930723","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/nyregion/news-summary-221093.html","abstract":"  INTERNATIONAL A2-8 BRITAIN SETS BACK UNITY TREATY  The British Government of John Major lost a crucial parliamentary vote on the European unity treaty, further weakening his hold on power and leaving the treaty's final ratification in limbo.

Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, cited several instances in the 1980's when the Supreme Court \"cut back on the legal protections against job discrimination.\" He then asked Judge Ginsburg to discuss her view of the Court majority's approach to construing civil rights laws in those cases.   JUDGE GINSBURG My view of the civil rights laws conforms to my views concerning statutory interpretation generally -- that is, it is the obligation of judges to construe statutes in the way that Congress meant them to be construed. Some statutes, not simply in the civil rights area but the anti-trust area, are meant to be broad charters: the Sherman Act. The Civil Rights Act states grand principles representing the highest aspirations of our nation to be a nation that is open and free, where all people will have opportunity.   And that spirit imbues that law, just as free competition is the spirit in the antitrust laws, and the courts construe statutes in accord with the essential meaning that Congress had for passing them.                    . . .         Q.  I note that in a 1979 speech at a colloquium on legislation for women's rights you stated that \"I think discrimination based on sexual orientation should be deplored.\" . . . I'd like to ask you whether you still believe, as you did in 1979, that \"discrimination based on sexual orientation should be deplored.\"   A.  I think rank discrimination against anyone is against the tradition of the United States and is to be deplored. Rank discrimination is not part of our nation's culture. Tolerance is. And a generous respect for differences based on -- this country is great because of its accommodation of diversity.    I mean, the first thing that I noticed when I came back to the United States from a prolonged stay in Sweden -- and after I was so accustomed to looking at people whose complexion was the same -- and I took my first ride on a New York subway and I thought, What a wonderful country we live in -- people who are so different in so many ways and yet we, for the most part, get along with each other. The richness of the diversity of this country is a treasure, and it's a constant challenge, too, to remain tolerant and respectful of one another.    Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, noted later that the courts had frequently deferred to military regulations far more restrictive than would be permitted in civilian law. He then referred to Judge Ginsburg's earlier testimony that she found \"rank discrimination\" deplorable and asked her precisely what she meant by the term.   A.  Yes. I think base discrimination is deplorable and against the spirit of this country -- discrimination, arbitrary discrimination without reason.   Q.  No. Does \"rank\" mean institutional discrimination? Does it mean intentional discrimination? Does it mean arbitrary discrimination? Because as I understand the Constitution, it is permissible to discriminate or to classify provided there is a rational basis for it.    A.  If I discriminated against some person for reasons that are irrelevant to that person's talent or ability, that is what I meant when I said rank discrimination: arbitrary discrimination that's unrelated to a person's ability or worth, unrelated to a person's talent; discrimination because -- simply because of who that person is and not what that person can do.   Q.  Or does? Or does? In other words, do you draw it upon that person's status or conduct? Would it be a difference, in your judgment?    A.  A person's birth status should be -- should not enter into the way that person is treated. The person who is born into a certain home with a certain religion or is born of a certain race, those are irrelevant characteristics to what that person can do or contribute to society.   Q.  What about sexual orientation?   A.  Senator, you know that that is a burning question that at this very moment is going to be before the Court, based on an action that has been taken. I cannot say one word on that subject that would not violate what I said had to be my rule about no hints, no forecasts, no previews.   Q.  Well, it seemed to me that you already did comment on that when you responded to Senator Kennedy this morning. He talked about race, religion, and gender and sexual orientation, and I think your comment was rank discrimination is deplorable under all of those circumstances.   A.  I think rank discrimination for any reason -- hair color, eye color, you name it -- rank discrimination is un-American for whatever reason. If you have a classification, there has to be a reason, as you said, for any classification.   On Capital Punishment   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, asked Judge Ginsburg whether she believed, \"as Justices Brennan and Marshall did,\" that the death penalty was incompatible with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.   A.  At least since 1976, and possibly if you date it from Furman and earlier, the Supreme Court by large majorities has rejected the position that the death penalty under any and all circumstances is unconstitutional.   I recognize that there is no judge on the Court that takes a position that the death penalty is unconstitutional under any and all circumstances; all of the Justices on the Court have rejected that view. There are many questions left unresolved. They are coming constantly before that Court. I think at least two are before the Court next year.   I can tell you that I have -- I do not have a closed mind on this subject. I don't want to commit my -- I don't think it would be consistent with the line I have tried to hold to tell you that I would definitely accept or definitely reject any position. I can tell you that I am well aware of the precedent, and I have already expressed my views on the value of precedent.    Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, cited Herrera v. Collins, in which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the majority, \"was unable to declare clearly and unequivocally that the Constitution forbids the execution of innocent people.\" He asked Judge Ginsburg, \"Do you believe the Herrera case stands for the principle that it is unconstitutional to execute an innocent person?\"    A.  As I understand it -- and the case is not fresh in my mind -- what the Court said was that the evidence in that case was insufficient to show innocence. It did not rule out a different ruling in a case with a stronger record. We heard yesterday from Senator Feinstein, who was expressing her anxiety with the number of cases that go on for years and years.   The colloquy that is occurring here is showing the tremendous tensions and difficulties in this area. Her anxious plight was there must be a time when the curtain is drawn, and your anxiety is that no innocent person should ever be put to death. Those tensions are coming before you, some of them, in the Powell Commission report that you are going to have to address.    My understanding of Herrera is it's concerned with the situation that someone could say, 10 years after a conviction and multiple appeals, \"I didn't do it,\" and then the process would start all over again. I can empathize tremendously with the concern.                    . . .         What the Court said -- and this is to the best of my recollection -- that the evidence was too slim in Herrera to make out that claim, and it left the door open to a case where there was stronger evidence of innocence. That case is yet to come before the Court in the future. So my understanding of this case is it, based on that particular record, said the evidence was too thin to show innocence, that the Court was leaving open the question of whether you could have such a plea on a stronger showing than the one that was made in that case. And that's as far as the Herrera case went. It just left open a case where a stronger showing could be made.    In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Judge Ginsburg declined to discuss her views on the death penalty because, she said, she had never decided a capital case or written about the subject. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, later reminded her that while practicing law she had written a friend-of-the-court brief in Coker v. Georgia, arguing \"that the death penalty for rape was not constitutional.\"   A.  I did not write about the question we've been addressing about the constitutionality of the death penalty. The Coker-against-Georgia brief was a brief that said the death penalty for rape, where there was no death or serious permanent injury apart from the obvious psychological injury -- that that was disproportionate for this reason: The death penalty for rape historically was part of a view of woman as belonging to man, as first her father's possession. If she were raped before marriage, she was damaged goods and she was not someone -- it was a theft of something that belonged first to the father. And if she were a married woman and she were raped, again she would be regarded as damaged goods.   We've seen that most recently in tragedies in many places in the world, where women in Bangladesh, for example, were discarded, were treated as worthless, because they had been raped. And that was what Coker against Georgia came out of, and that's the whole thrust of that brief, that this was made punishable by death because man's property had been taken from him because of the rape of women. And that was the perspective that was taken in the Coker-against-Georgia brief.    Q.  On page 22 of that brief, a heading underlined says, \"The death sentence for rape is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment because it does not meet 'contemporary standards' regarding the infliction of punishment and is inadvisable since it diminishes legal protection afforded rape victims.\" It seems to me it deals directly with the issue of the Eighth Amendment.   A.  Senator Grassley, I urge you to read the entire Coker-against-Georgia brief. I think you will find it to be exactly what I represented it to be. One of the reasons why rapes went unpunished, why women who had been raped suffered the indignity of having the police refuse to prosecute, was statutes of that order.                    . . .         I've written on the subject of women who have been raped and society's attitude toward them. Coker against Georgia fits into that category, and it must not be taken out of context to say anything about any other subject than the one that was addressed in that brief. And that was that the death penalty for rape -- the origin of that and the perpetuation of it -- was harmful to women, far from resulting in convictions.                    . . .         It was a contribution to the proper way to look at this terrible crime. It was a contribution to the end of thinking of women as damaged goods because they had been raped. That's what I think about it. On Free Expression   Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked whether freedom of expression was still an evolving right under the Constitution.   A.  Free expression, I think, was an idea from the start, even before the limitations on it -- the Alien and Sedition Act, which I think never was reversed by the Supreme Court but certainly has been reversed by the history of our country since that time. The idea was there from the beginning, -- though I mentioned the Revolutionary War cartoon, \"Liberty of speech for those who speak the speech of liberty\" -- the idea was always there. The great opposition to the government as censor was always there.   But it is only in our time that that right has come to be recognized as fully as it is today with the line of cases ending in Brandenburg v. Ohio -- truly recognizes that free speech means not freedom of thought and speech for those with whom we agree, but freedom of expression for the expression we hate. I think that there are always new contexts that will be presented but that the dissenting positions of Holmes and Brandeis have become the law that everyone accepts. I think that is the case today.   Q.  What about in the area of entertainment?    A.  Well, now we're getting into more slippery territory. It depends what kind of entertainment, I suppose. You know that the Supreme Court has a series of decisions about the speech that's in the kind of nether land between fully protected speech and unprotected speech. Indecent speech -- you have -- it's not subject to -- that is within the First Amendment but not entitled to the same level of protection as other speech.   The Supreme Court has had decisions about the -- what do they call? -- adult movie theaters, that those can be zoned for the safety of the neighborhood. They can either be -- a municipality can decide to spread them out so they won't be clustered or can put them all together in one combat zone. So there is a difference between the degree of respect of the kind of knowledge, information -- political speech on the one hand; then, as you know, there is this category of speech that is unprotected by the First Amendment called obscenity. And then there is this category of speech that's not out of the ball park but that is subject to regulation, indecent speech.   That's an area that I can't talk about in specific terms because it is something that is -- has come before my court, is coming before the Supreme Court in connection with broadcast regulation. But I do recognize that there are those -- there is that category of speech that does not get the full protection of the First Amendment but is not left out entirely.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930723","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Michael Hepher, managing director of BT PLC, is reading \"Prophets in the Dark\" by David T.

After two and one-half hours of negotiations -- broken up by lunch -- an agreement was reached on a one-year contract worth $750,000, plus incentives based on playing time and starting time, and Nagle had fulfilled his wish to be in camp in time to compete for the starting job with Boomer Esiason.
