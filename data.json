Besides being the only piece in which cans were actually thwacked during the eight-and-a-half-hour program, its underlying philosophy has much in common with that of this eclectic new music series. When Cage composed this percussion quartet 53 years ago, he retained ties to the conventional music world and produced a fully notated score. Eventually, he would grant his interpreters considerable leeway.   But in 1941 he was breaking away from the mainstream in other ways. Advancing the notion that music can be wrung out of anything, he proposed an ensemble in which found objects augment a standard percussion battery. He also celebrated the primacy of rhythm. In \"Third Construction,\" melody is an illusion, suggested by the different pitches of the instruments, and harmony is frozen out entirely. And another of its elements -- its edgy, unflagging energy -- was ably conveyed by the Talujon Percussion Quartet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"Books of The Times; One Disney Character's Real Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/books/books-of-the-times-one-disney-character-s-real-life.html","abstract":"  A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes  My Story  By Annette Funicello with Patricia Romanowski  Illustrated. 237 pages.

If the Devils, who lead the four-of-seven-game series, 3-2, can eliminate the Bruins from the Stanley Cup playoffs, they would have a date with the Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals starting on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Should the Devils lose, Brodeur would guard the Devils' goal in Game 7 on Friday night at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, where he stopped all 22 shots the Bruins fired at him Monday night in New Jersey's 2-0 victory. Seeking an Edge    In these playoffs, coaches and players seek any kind of an edge. That is why Lemaire turned to a goalie tandem in the midst of a series. The coach's assumptions were that Brodeur, the 22-year-old rookie who had played well in nine straight games, might be somewhat worn and that Terreri would regard Boston Garden as an old friend.    The Bruins beat the Devils and Brodeur in the first two games here and then New Jersey won twice at Boston, with Terreri playing back-to-back games for the first time since March 12-13.    Terreri, from Warwick, R.I., said today that he was first taken to the Boston Garden at age 6 by his father for a Bruins game. He knows well the tight rink with little skating space behind the goal from having played there so often in five full seasons with the Devils and in Hockey East games while he played for Providence College.    \"Chris is confident,\" said Lemaire. \"And the players are confident in Chris.\"   Terreri dismisses the reality that his playing time all but disappeared in the last weeks of the regular season. He's flattered that his coach turned to him when the Devils went to Boston down 2-0. 'I'm Having Fun'    \"We were fighting for our lives,\" said Terreri. \"Of course, you want to play. But you respect what he says.    \"I'm thrilled I got a chance to help in the playoffs, that I've got a chance to win this series. It's a team game and I'm having fun.\"   Terreri added that he is as comfortable as he can be for Game 6 and that his teammates want to end the series Wednesday night.   \"Nobody wants to come back here Friday,\" said Terrari.   And nobody is mentioning the Rangers, just yet.    Lemaire's intentions with his two goaltenders in this series were always apparent to Terreri, who approved of them. \"It gives this team another dimension,\" Terreri said. Defensive Gem    According to Lemaire, the Devils played \"probably our best game defensively\" on Monday night.   The teams played evenly with swift up-and-down movement through the first period. After the first goal, by Corey Millen at 1 minute 23 seconds of the second period, Lemaire said: \"There was a difference. At that moment we started to take charge. I could feel it on the bench.\"   With 22 seconds remaining in the period, Bobby Carpenter and Claude Lemieux caught the Bruins on a 2-on-1 break. Lemieux passed the puck to Carpenter, who shot it from near the top of the right circle over Boston goaltender Jon Casey's glove.   The Devils tied up the Bruins at center ice much of the time and Adam Oates, Boston's great set-up man, all but disappeared. The Boston version, as expressed by Coach Brian Sutter, was that the Bruins stood around too much and stopped skating.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/style/chronicle-064041.html","abstract":"  ELIZABETH DE CROY, the Princess of Solre, a descendant of Hungarian kings from the Holy Roman Empire, has a mission that has occupied her for almost 25 years.

Mr. Schembri's lawyer said all his client did in the incident, in which Mr. Schembri confronted Sergeant DeVito over his work outside the police department, was touch Mr. DeVito's cheek.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"Albany Court Backs Ruling On Homeless","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/nyregion/albany-court-backs-ruling-on-homeless.html","abstract":"  The state's top court ordered New York City today to pay more than $3.5 million in fines to 5,000 homeless families that have been forced to spend nights on tables, chairs and floors in city offices rather than in suitable shelters.   Advocates for the homeless said the 7-0 ruling by the Court of Appeals was a stinging condemnation of former Mayor David N. Dinkins's management of homelessness policy, and said that it could undermine plans by his successor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, to overhaul the shelter system. Coming less than a week after Mr. Giuliani announced a tough new homeless plan, the ruling, critics said, served as a reminder that New York's courts will force the city to provide emergency housing immediately to families in need. Advocates Are Confident    Mr. Giuliani said last week that the city would begin denying shelter to homeless families who refuse to participate in drug and alcohol treatment and job training programs. But advocates for the homeless, including those who filed the lawsuit that led to today's ruling, have predicted that New York's courts will not allow homeless families to be tossed into the streets. They said that today's ruling reinforces their case.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"It's Spring Fever For Sports Fans; Hailing Knicks and Rangers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/11/nyregion/it-s-spring-fever-for-sports-fans-hailing-knicks-and-rangers.html","abstract":"  James Rossi felt a little guilty about skipping his daughter's 10th birthday party Monday evening to catch the Rangers on television.

It takes an optimistic nature to believe his administration can raise the city bureaucracy's productivity enough to sustain services while reducing the number of employees. But, as the Mayor points out, he has already accomplished some things his critics claimed could not be done. Most notably, he has persuaded unions to accept a severance plan for city employees and to give him extraordinary authority to transfer employees between agencies.   The budget Mr. Giuliani submitted to the City Council yesterday was his formal plan for fiscal 1995, starting July 1. He faced an awesome $2.3 billion deficit -- the largest since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's. And closing the gap is made more difficult by the public's rebellion against further tax increases. In contrast to predecessors who raised taxes, the Mayor opts to cut them -- only $35 million next year, but $260 million the year after, and more after that. He includes long-overdue relief for apartment owners, who pay higher taxes than owners of houses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940511","headline":"Civic Duty Calls.

Nelson Mandela's inaugural in Cape Town yesterday was all of that and more. Over a billion television viewers around the world, surely a record in this department, saw him take the oath as South Africa's first black President. It was like being alive in the time of Lincoln, whose great address Mr. Mandela echoed in affirming that South Africans finally had a government of, by and for the people.    Most remarkable was the orderly way in which old white political citadels fell overnight to new black majorities in both national and provincial parliaments. Former prisoners mingled civilly with their erstwhile oppressors, and new anthems and flags became part of the rites. In a striking and moving gesture, Mr. Mandela even paused to thank the white warders who had become his friends during his 27 years in prison, forming a bond that surmounted the walls of apartheid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940511","time":"1994-05-11

He has vetoed the contract and wants to have his Labor Commissioner take the lead in negotiations.   This is a complicated issue, raised to a high emotional pitch by the recent budget battle that pitted the Mayor and the Chancellor against each other in a bruising public confrontation. In that battle, we stood squarely behind the Chancellor in his efforts to repel the Mayor's unwarranted intervention.

Championship lead with Dottie Mochrie. Juli Inkster and Noelle Daghe were one shot back, and Laura Davies was one of five golfers to shoot 70 on the wet, wind-blown course at the DuPont Country Club in Wilmington, Del. Play was suspended by darkness at 8:25 P.M. with just three players on the course. Nancy Lopez, a three-time winner of the event, struggled with lower-back pain and withdrew after 14 holes. She shot six over par.

It was a clear act of defiance toward the international community, which last week voted in the U.N. to intensify sanctions against Haiti to force its illegitimate rulers to step down and allow the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In response, some members of Congress and other observers have begun talking more seriously about the use of military force to oust the coup leaders and allow Father Aristide to return.   That would be a mistake. Mr. Jonassaint's appointment does not materially change the situation in Haiti. The new sanctions, set to begin May 21, should be given a chance to work. The pressure they will exert on the country's rulers will be just as uncomfortable, whether or not they are living under the charade of a legitimate government.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940513","headline":"Mexico Invites U.N. to Attend Election to Observe the Observers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/world/mexico-invites-un-to-attend-election-to-observe-the-observers.html","abstract":"  Trampling an ancient political taboo in pursuit of new legitimacy for Mexico's coming presidential vote, the Government has invited the United Nations to evaluate its electoral system and help organize independent groups of election observers.

Those days usually ended at 10 P.M. with dinner at my desk.   There was no time for reflection, no time to exchange ideas with fellow senators.

On one side, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway soars overhead on high trestles, cutting Red Hook off from the rest of Brooklyn. A junkyard stands on a second side, and smokestacks rise from a third, standing witness to the indomitable flowers that grow in this most hardscrabble of fields.   The games are big spectator sport in the neighborhood. Like baseball or basketball, soccer is best watched with food. Around the field is some of the best and freshest street food in New York, sold by families who have simply set up a table and a grill. From all directions, the sizzle of cooking meat cuts through the merengue and salsa music booming from portable stereos, vans and larger amplification devices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940513","headline":"Gift Limits Sought for Attorney General Race","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/nyregion/gift-limits-sought-for-attorney-general-race.html","abstract":"  Challenging her opponents to do the same, Karen S.
