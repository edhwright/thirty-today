The Germans again dominated in diving, winning a fourth gold medal in a row, and Hungary's triple Olympic medalist, Krisztina Egerszegi, coasted to victory in the women's 400-meter individual medley. Guttler, a Hungarian, became the first swimmer to break the 61-second barrier in the 100-meter breast-stroke when he set a world record in a heat before winning the gold. During the first day of racing in the Ponds Forge pool, Guttler clocked 1 minute 00.95 seconds in the final heat. In the final, Guttler went off to a fast first 50 meters and seemed on his way to breaking the record again. He managed 1:01.04, while Nick Gillingham of Britain came in second with 1:02.02. Van Almsick, who won two silver and two bronze medals for Germany at last year's Olympics at age 14, won the 100 meters in European record time, then went on to another gold in the 800-meters freestyle relay. In the diving pool, Germany won its fourth final in a row when Brita Baldus got 541.68 points in the 3-meter springboard final.

The appeals court, which had reopened the case last year on its own initiative, criticized the Justice Department, calling its prosecution \"careless at the very least.\" It also aggressively questioned how Attorney General Janet Reno could have supported the legal position that Mr. Demjanjuk (pronounced dem-ahn-YUKE) should remain banished from the United States while the Federal courts reconsider their earlier order that had stripped him of his American citizenship. A Return to Ohio    The decision today means that Mr. Demjanjuk, a 73-year-old retired auto worker who was extradited to Israel in 1986 to face war-crime charges, will very likely wind up returning to his family in Ohio. He remains in a small prison cell near Tel Aviv for eight more days while the Israeli Government decides what to do with him. American prosecutors asked the court to stay its ruling so it could appeal it.

Giving shelter to people in need has been an Albanian tradition that benefited many Montenegrins and Bosnians before World War II, the Jewish community when our country was occupied by the Nazis and numerous Greeks who fled into Albania in the late 1940's because of the political and military circumstances in their homeland.   Now, as other European, Middle Eastern and Asian countries have done, Albania is receiving thousands of refugees from Bosnia, mostly women and children, despite very limited resources. But this only and nothing else is foreseen in the various Albanian talks and agreements with the Bosnian authorities. The Albanian Government would never allow any use of these camps for other purposes and will provide access there for anybody who might want to check them.   As for the Albanian negative vote to the admission of Macedonia into the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it is only conditioned by the failing of the Macedonian Government to give the Albanian community living there the rights it was committed to give, such as proportional representation in the state apparatus, more schools, an Albanian university and more access in the national news media.   Furthermore, the Albanians in Macedonia are crucially supporting the internal stability of that young state. Many international community leaders have publicly recognized that the Republic of Albania, with its commitment to peace and to easing tensions, its opposition to any violent change of borders and its realistic policy, has made a major contribution to stability in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula.
