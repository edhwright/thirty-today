It also made a star of Mary Pierce, the French-Canadian-American teen-ager who rescued the tennis dress from obsolescence, and whose life story is the stuff of which Grade B movies are made.   The springtime showers that seem intent on pelting Paris daily parted just long enough on Sunday to make space for a pair of French Open finals confirmed Sergi Bruguera, who made a triumphant defense of his 1993 crown, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who reclaimed the title she'd won at 17, as the best clay-court artists in the world. The finals also confirmed what most of the tennis community already knew, that Spain, which produced three of the four finalists, is the undisputed global powerhouse of clay-court tennis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940607","headline":"Knicks Take Off For Final Mission","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/07/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-take-off-for-final-mission.html","abstract":"  Determined to win the franchise's first championship since 1973, the Knicks departed for Houston today -- excited, exhausted and ecstatic about their new status as Eastern Conference champions.

What follows is an update on the 24 teams in the finals. The tournament begins on June 17 when Germany, the defending champion, plays Bolivia in Chicago. The World Cup concludes with the championship game in Pasadena, Calif., on July 17. Argentina    The Argentines concluded their preparatory matches with a disappointing scoreless tie against Croatia in Zagreb on Saturday. They are training at Babson College near Boston. Belgium    Belgium registered a 9-0 triumph over Zambia on Saturday and has a game against Hungary in Brussels tomorrow before arriving at its training site in Orlando, Fla., on Friday. Bolivia    The Bolivians have a game against Peru tomorrow and will arrive at UMass-Dartmouth on Thursday before traveling to Montreal to play Switzerland on Saturday. Brazil    The Brazilians suffered a morale-shattering blow on Sunday in a 1-1 tie with Canada in Edmonton, Alberta. They have a game against Honduras tomorrow in San Diego and a game against El Salvador on Sunday at Fresno, Calif. Their training base is at Santa Clara, Calif. Bulgaria    This is a team in turmoil after the president of the national federation -- who had promised the players large bonuses if they do well in the World Cup -- resigned last week. The team arrived in Dallas last night and will train at Southern Methodist University. Cameroon    For financial reasons, the Indomitable Lions have been training in Haiti instead of Los Angeles. The good news is that the 42-year-old Roger Milla, the hero of the team's run to the quarterfinals in Italy four years ago, is on the roster. Colombia    The new favorite among the South American entries, the Colombians proved in victories over Northern Ireland and Greece last weekend that they are in impressive form. They will be training at Cal-State Fullerton in California. Germany    The defending champion will conclude its warm-up matches with a game against Canada tomorrow in Toronto before moving to Chicago in advance of the tournament's opening match against Bolivia. Greece    Not only were the Greeks outplayed by Colombia in a 2-0 loss on Sunday, their locker room at Giants Stadium was broken into and ransacked, according to their coach, Alkis Panagoulis. Later in the day, the Nassau County, L.I., police reported that three hotel rooms occupied by the players were also burglarized. The team is leaving for Middlesex School near Boston tomorrow, and not a day too soon. Ireland    Despite a 3-1 loss at home to the Czech Republic on Sunday in its last preparatory match, more than 7,000 fans were at the Dublin airport yesterday to give the team a rousing send-off for Orlando, Fla., where it will train. Italy    The Italians will arrive today in New Jersey and settle at their training site, at the Pingry School near Princeton. They edged Switzerland on a questionable goal in Rome on Saturday and will conclude their preparation with a game against Costa Rica on Saturday at the Yale Bowl in New Haven. Mexico    After a 1-0 loss to the United States on Saturday, the Mexicans have one more exhibition left: Saturday in Miami against Northern Ireland, a nonqualifier. The Mexicans will train at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., next week. Morocco    The Moroccans will arrive in Orlando on Saturday to prepare for their opener there, against Belgium. They will train for four days at Rutgers before their game against Saudi Arabia June 25 at Giants Stadium. The Netherlands    Ruud Gullit's departure will have a negative effect on a team that was once one of the favorites to win the World Cup. The Dutch have a game against Canada on Sunday in Toronto before they settle at their training site at the University of Central Florida. Nigeria    They received an official letter of apology from Dallas Mayor Richard Beckert after a report in a local newspaper quoted the city's police chief, James McLaughlin, making racist remarks about Nigerian fans. Norway    The Norwegians lost, 2-0, to Sweden on Sunday in Stockholm and will conclude their preparatory matches against Denmark tomorrow in Oslo. They will arrive at their training base in Princeton, N.J., on Thursday. Romania    A scoreless tie with Slovenia was disappointing. Romania will conclude its preparations in a game against Sweden on Sunday in San Diego. The Romanians arrived at their training site in Los Angeles last Friday. Russia    The Russians are scheduled to arrive at their training site near San Francisco tomorrow to prepare for their opener against Brazil on June 20. Saudi Arabia    The Saudis have been training at Richard Stockton State College in Pomona, N.J., for two weeks. After their scoreless tie against the United States, the Saudis beat Trinidad and Tobago by six goals on Saturday. They will play Northern Ireland tomorrow. South Korea    The South Koreans arrived yesterday in Dallas and will play there against Honduras on Saturday in their last preparatory game. Spain    After a 2-1 victory over Finland last Friday, the Spaniards have a game against Canada in Montreal on Friday, then travel to their training headquarters near Chicago. Sweden    Tomas Brolin scored both goals in the 2-0 victory over Norway on Sunday and could be a star in the tournament. The Swedes will play Romania on Sunday in San Diego before moving to Los Angeles to train. Switzerland    The close 1-0 loss to Italy in Rome on Saturday gives the Swiss some hope. They play Bolivia on Saturday in Montreal before going to their training site in Detroit. They open the tournament against the United States on June 18 in the Pontiac Silverdome. United States    The 1-0 victory over Mexico on Saturday in Los Angeles is the best thing that has happened to the Americans since the 2-0 victory over England last June. The victory lifted their spirits, but it will mean nothing unless they come away with a victory in their opening game of the tournament against Switzerland.

The bacteria, called group A strep, are reported to have caused a dozen deaths in England this year, giving rise to widespread alarm. The microorganisms in their severe, invasive form can cause a fatal drop in blood pressure, toxic shock and organ failure and, in about 25 to 50 percent of cases, in a form known as necrotizing fasciitis can eat away at flesh. Another form, called myositis, eats at muscle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940608","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/nyregion/c-corrections-333859.html","abstract":"  The calendar of events in the Long Island Weekly on Sunday misstated the date of the opening reception for \"A Cartoon Celebration: The Berndt Toast Gang,\" at the Mills Pond House on Route 25A in St. James, L.I.

Lacking any one piece of conclusive evidence that tied the men together, Government lawyers built their case out of fragments and circumstantial evidence involving each defendant that convinced a jury of their collective guilt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940608","headline":"Pianist Promotes Elementary School Focusing on Music","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/arts/pianist-promotes-elementary-school-focusing-on-music.html","abstract":"  Seven years after immigrating to New York from Moscow, the concert pianist Vladimir Feltsman is spearheading plans to open a public elementary school in Manhattan for musically gifted children.

SCHOOLS FIND SPACE IN UNUSUAL PLACES   Most of the children who squeeze into the elementary schools of District 24 in southwest Queens, the most crowded in New York City, seem not to realize that they are learning under extraordinary circumstances. But for their teachers and administrators, life is a scramble of workarounds and compromises. A1. NEW YORK CITY  SYMBOL OF BLIGHT SHOWS PROGRESS   Nothing symbolized quite so powerfully the problem of urban blight in the 1980's as the pictures of curtains and potted plants that were placed on the windows of abandoned apartment buildings in the Bronx.

It is the Ranger defenseman's way to deal with a playoff tension that has grown for weeks. As New York's fortunes have ebbed and flowed, and now, even as they have come within one game of a Stanley Cup championship, the most dominant player on the ice has struggled to keep his emotions under control.    \"When the opportunity is there, get involved,\" Leetch said, \"but otherwise get it off the boards and get it out of the zone.\"    His mindset is part of a spectacular final stage of his continuing development this season. Leetch's goal and three assists became a powerful enough factor in the 4-2 Ranger victory tonight to all but guarantee that an American-born player will win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the finals. Spectaular Playoffs    Leetch has scored four goals with five assists in the series. He has 10 goals, with 22 assists, in the playoffs. Leetch's total of 32 playoff points passed Al MacInnis of Calgary to become second to Paul Coffey's record of 47 points in 1985.    But his presence again extended beyond offensive statistics. On an evening when the Ranger defensive unit struggled at times to deal with the sudden strikes of the Vancouver Canucks, Leetch took advantage of enough opportunitites to help change a game, and perhaps a championship series.    \"It's hard to say that his play has improved since the Islander series, but it has,\" said Coach Mike Keenan. \"He started the playoffs playing his best hockey and he has improved it every series from that point on. He has just been an exceptional player for us. He's making things happen offensively. He's playing exceptionally well defensively. He has been able to withstand a tremendous amount of ice time, and he has the stamina and endurance and drive to lead the hockey team.\"    Leetch's 10th goal of the playoffs, at 4 minutes 3 seconds of the second period, presented a reward for Mike Richter's game-saving goaltending. The play ended with Leetch waiting for Joe Kocur to present a problem in front of the net, a technique he explained was developed in part to compensate for the power that was lost because of an injured shoulder.    But the start of the play underlined the unspectacular but essential part of Leetch's game -- a poke check at the Ranger blue line that sent the flow in the opposite direction.    His smooth pass that helped create Aleksel Kovalev's third-period power-play goal, the game-winning score, was part creativity and part necessity. Leetch felt a slash from the stick of Canuck defenseman Brian Glynn, whom he had just passed to create a two-on-one, with Jyrki Lumme the one Canuck back.    \"I didn't think I could get off a good shot there,\" said Leetch, who had his shoulder iced after the game.    So as the two approached the net, seemingly in slow motion, Leetch made himself into a playmaker. \"I tried to make it look like I was going to shoot,\" he said, \"and I just slid it under the guy's stick.\"    When the game was over and the Cup was a game away, Leetch had one more move to make. Mark Messier was behind a desk in an interview area, already dressed in a suit, sitting in the television lights. Leetch was standing to the side, in the wings, in a blue Ranger windbreaker and shorts. His hair was still matted. He studied the floor as Messier spoke. Finally, the Ranger captain heard the question:    \"Mark, you've won a Conn Smythe Trophy. Is Brian Leetch a Conn Smyth winner?\"    Down the hall, in the Ranger dressing room, Leetch's teammates were already reciting how difficult the final step would be. There is a party line to remember. But near the end of Leetch's remarkable spring, with his team one game away, it seemed the exit polls were all closing early.    \"We're not going to fall into that trap,\" Messier said at first. But then, he skated around it. \"Obviously,\" Messier observed, \"His performance, in the last two games, he has been the best we've all seen in a long time.\"    That is still for the others to say. Maybe it will always be that way for Leetch. He was asked what thought appears in his head when he hears the name Conn Smythe. \"That really doesn't matter to me,\" Leetch said. \"I haven't won the cup before. I haven't been to the finals before.\"   He was keeping it simple to the end.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940608","headline":"Mr. Foley, Still Dancing on Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/opinion/mr-foley-still-dancing-on-reform.html","abstract":"  \"Your ideas,\" House Speaker Thomas Foley tells grass-roots Democrats in a recent fund-raising letter for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, \"will help us formulate a list of our legislative priorities.\"    Mr. Foley does not, however, care to hear from the grass roots on one pressing issue.

It's easy to hear why he's so popular. At 28, Mr. Coltrane is rapidly acquiring a distinctive voice, with a thoughtfulness that sometimes eludes more experienced musicians.   His set on Tuesday night showed him to be an improviser who, in his reticence, forces a listener to follow him. At first he sounded almost timid. But after a few minutes it became clear his improvisations were loaded with turnbacks, repetitions, asides and afterthoughts, as if he were having a conversation with himself. He broke his solos into fragments, short bursts that were always self-referential and oddly balanced. Where jazz instrumentalists often seek a linear flow, Mr. Coltrane's solos were occasionally still, as if he were building a static monument out of ideas, repeated, examined, turned over, turned sideways and then added to a pile of previously used motifs.   He can burn, too. Backed by Billy Childs on piano, Calvin Jones on bass and Cindy Blackman on drums, Mr. Coltrane, on up-tempo tunes, draped harmony over harmony, compressing dense phrases into small spaces. He has the gift of ease and even ideas that should have been unmanageably dissonant, or pitches that sailed way off the mark, floated back into his schema. Mr. Coltrane hasn't yet figured out how to use dynamics, or articulate all his ideas. And he doesn't have a group conception, at least on the evidence of this one set. But he has promise, intelligence and individuality, which is more than half the battle.

Under the cap, mothers who give birth while on welfare would receive no additional money for the care of the additional child. That will do little good and much harm. According to nearly every careful study, family caps do nothing to discourage childbirth but they do victimize innocent children.   Family caps, which are also included in several bills already before Congress, are based on the false notion that larger benefit checks encourage welfare mothers to have more babies and thereby stay longer on welfare. But a welfare mother would have to be crazy to think of babies as an economic advantage. The average extra stipend to welfare mothers who give birth is less than $75 a month -- which does not even cover the cost of diapers and other expenses for the new baby.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/nyregion/news-summary-336327.html","abstract":"  International A3-11  JAPAN BALKS AT SANCTIONS  The Clinton Administration's plan to seek new global sanctions against North Korea for its defiance of nuclear inspectors has run into resistance from Japan.

Giuliani preach his gospel of homelessness and \"mutual responsibility,\" one is struck by its narcotic effect on audiences. Many of us would like to believe, it seems, that the homeless are homeless largely because they refuse to help themselves. Wouldn't it be easier to pass scores of beggars each day, or read about families sleeping in welfare offices, if we knew that they were there not because of economic forces but because they refused to enroll in a drug treatment or job training program?\n\nThe Mayor's new plan would compel homeless people to sign \"independent living plans\" to \"assist them in resolving their crises and in moving towards independent living.\" Never mind that it is almost impossible to place homeless people in effective drug treatment because there are no available beds -- and that scores of beds in these programs are occupied by people who have completed treatment but cannot leave because they have no housing. The major flaw in the Mayor's proposal is the lack of resources committed to getting people up and out of the obscenely expensive shelter system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"Classic Layout Offers a Primer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/sports/golf-classic-layout-offers-a-primer.html","abstract":"  Fred Couples was standing in the rough to the right of the 15th fairway today, looking down at his golf ball. All he could see was the barest sliver of balata, like a bald spot peeking through a thick thatch of poa annua grass.   Ordinarily, PGA Tour pros don't see this kind of lie at regular events. But the Buick Classic, which gets under way Thursday at the Westchester Country Club, is not like many of the other tournaments on tour. On this classic old layout, designed and built by J. Walter Travis in 1919, there are an assortment of blind shots, firm and fast greens, tough lies in heavy rough and enough difficult holes to provide a thorough examination of a player's game.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/world/c-corrections-337471.html","abstract":"  A brief report by Reuters in Business Day on Tuesday about trade in Latin America misstated Chile's association with the Mercosur group of countries.

Security Council in 1950 enabled the United States to counter aggression from North Korea under a U.N. flag. That diplomatic cover was useful; it was not a case of North Korea against the U.S. and its ally South Korea, but of an aggressor against the world.   Though the Korean Conflict was never officially called a war, it cost the U.S. about 150,000 casualties. Because Chinese \"volunteers\" intervened after MacArthur had victory in his grasp, it ended in stalemate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"Call St. John's The Red Storm","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/sports/call-st-john-s-the-red-storm.html","abstract":"  After completing its worst basketball season in 31 years, St. John's has changed its nickname.
