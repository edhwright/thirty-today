When the Jesus Lizard, a quartet based in Chicago, performed on Saturday night at Irving Plaza, its singer, David Yow, dived into the audience repeatedly and sang entire songs while propped up on the arms and heads of his fans. Remarkably, Mr. Yow rarely missed more than a line or two of each song, even when he was accidentally dropped on the floor.   Mr. Yow didn't care much about sound quality when onstage either. He often cupped his hands around the microphone to muffle his voice and dropped the microphone on the ground with a thud. The music was much less freewheeling than Mr. Yow's antics. The Jesus Lizard plays hard, heavy rock in which the guitar, bass and drums are strictly syncopated, providing structure behind Mr. Yow's distorted lyrics about death and mayhem. The bassist, David Wm. Sims, is the lead instrumentalist, plucking his bass incessantly and melodically over the loud, precise drumming of Mac McNeilly and the low-pitched chiming of Duane Denison's guitar. The result is the muddy mixture of industrial music, Southern rock and heavy metal that the Jesus Lizard has been performing almost peerlessly for more than five years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941004","headline":"Viruses or Prions: An Old Medical Debate Still Rages","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/science/viruses-or-prions-an-old-medical-debate-still-rages.html","abstract":"  EVER since James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA in 1953, one thing seemed perfectly clear.

Just last season, Mr. Gergiyev, music director of the Kirov Opera, led the New York Philharmonic in a stunning survey of Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" that was full of daring, imaginative brushstrokes. He also made his Metropolitan Opera debut conducting Verdi's \"Otello,\" and in his empathetic shaping of the score proved to be an ideal accompaniment for the contemporary master of the title role, Placido Domingo.   Last weekend at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Gergiyev brought the Kirov Opera's orchestra here from St. Petersburg as part of a 12-city United States tour, and again showed why he inspires the sort of wonder that used to be reserved for touring Russians during the Iron Curtain days. Mr. Gergiyev (born in 1953) has established the Kirov Opera as the most significant musical organization in Russia (at least for Westerners). Despite flaws in some performances in these two sold-out concerts, he proved again to be one of the most impressive contemporary performers of the Russian orchestral repertory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941004","headline":"One Person's Public Good Is Another's Squeeze Play","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/nyregion/our-towns-one-person-s-public-good-is-another-s-squeeze-play.html","abstract":"  SABATINI'S RESTAURANT, short and plain, sits on a prime corner of Pacific Avenue, dwarfed by glittering casinos.

The orchestra has a long association with the Y and its concert hall, and it has a loyal subscriber base there.

In one calculation of the universe's expansion rate, by which its size and age can be derived, a team led by Dr. Michael J.

Lunch items, to take out or eat in at little cafe tables or at the counter, include sandwiches (roasted vegetables, for example, or French-style ham, $5 to $6), salads (like ratatouille, couscous with vegetables or lentils, mostly $2 to $5 a pound), and main dishes, including roast chicken ($4.50 to $12). There are also dessert tarts, cakes and cookies. The shop is open from 9 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. A Second Porcini Trading    Porcini Trading, a small produce market that opened last fall at 1450 Second Avenue (75th Street), has just opened a second, larger market at 1510 Second Avenue (78th Street). The owners plan to keep both stores open. The new market sells some prepared foods and has a broader selection of groceries and dairy products than the original market. Both now have fresh imported porcini mushrooms from Italy. They range in price from $7.50 to $30 a pound, depending on the size and quality, which for the beefy top-of-the-line ones is impeccable.  Corrado Opens a Market    Joining Corrado, a restaurant at 1373 Avenue of the Americas (55th Street), and its neighboring Corrado Cafe and Corrado Kitchen catering shop is the new Corrado Market. But instead of being clustered with the other Corrado properties, this food market and catering shop is uptown, at 1409 Second Avenue (73d Street). It is a spacious, rather homey-looking food market with a typical array of produce, breads, cheeses and some high-end packaged groceries like olive oils and pasta.   Some of the prepared food items are especially delicious, like the penne pasta with eggplant, baked butternut squash, linguine with shiitake mushrooms, all for $7 a pound, and the fresh salmon salad, $15 a pound. The market is open every day. Telephone: (212) 472-9200. Mail-Order Spices    Adriana's Bazaar, a retail store on the Upper West Side that sold spices and condiments from around the world until it closed earlier this year, has become Adriana's Caravan, a mail-order company in Brooklyn with a catalogue of more than 1,000 items. Copies of the catalogue can be ordered for $3 by calling (800) 316-0820. A condensed version of the catalogue is free. Hot Stuff in Flux    Another source of spiciness may also switch to mail order. Hot Stuff, a shop specializing in spicy ingredients, at 227 Sullivan Street (near Bleecker Street), will close at the end of the year. David Jenkins, the owner, said he hoped to open a new store elsewhere in Manhattan with a small restaurant, to help generate better sales, or to convert it into a mail order house.  The Parlor Set    The younger generation should be more than happy with the fare at Mr. Chips, 27 East 92d Street, a classy new ice-cream parlor owned by Chip Fisher. Mr. Fisher, who has young children and lives in the neighborhood, also owns Fisher & Levy, a cafe and caterer, and Lamalle Kitchenware.    The new ice-cream parlor is sleekly modern, done in blond wood, with low counters and child-height stools in sherbet pastels. A swath of chalk board, with chalk provided, covers the wall above the counter. The ice cream comes in more than a dozen flavors. The restaurant is open from 11:30 A.M to 10 P.M. on weekdays, and from noon to 10 P.M. on weekends. Battle of the Wines    An all-day tasting to compare American chardonnays and pinot noirs with French red and white Burgundies made from the same grapes has been scheduled for Dec. 10 at the International Wine Center, 231 West 29th Street, Suite 210. The tasting, which will begin at 10 A.M. and end at about 4:30 P.M., will cover 42 wines and include lunch. The wines will be tasted blind in groups of three. The fee for the tasting is $235 and must be paid in full to secure a reservation. More information is available from the Wine Center, (212) 268-7517. Indian Feast in Queens    Dinner for 50,000? That is about how many people are expected to show up for an Indian folk and food festival from 8 P.M. to 1 A.M. Friday, Saturday and Sunday and next Friday and Saturday , Oct. 14 and 15, in Flushing Meadow Park, Queens. The festival, called Garba '94, will feature music, dancing and appearances by Indian movie stars. The garba is a kind of dance.    More than 100 food stalls will be selling portions of Indian specialties for $2 to $5. Admission to the festival, which was organized by Rhythm of India, an association of Indian businesses in Jackson Heights, Queens, is $20; those 60 and older will be admitted for $13. More information can be obtained by calling (718) 803-3333.

The $61 billion maker of cigarettes, food and beer has been one of the nation's biggest supporters of culture since 1958, and unlike many companies, Philip Morris has generally given lots of money and asked nothing in return.    Until now. Late last month, writhing in dismay over strong anti-smoking legislation pending before the New York City Council, Philip Morris executives telephoned arts institutions that had benefited from their largess and asked them to put in a good word with Peter F.

The requests were only a small part of a much larger lobbying campaign Philip Morris has mounted against the bill, which at one point led to threats, later retracted, to move its headquarters out of New York City.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941005","headline":"Metropolitan Diary","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/05/arts/metropolitan-diary-443107.html","abstract":"  DEAR DIARY:   My wife, who teaches first grade at the Grace Church School in Greenwich Village, heard one of the boys humming the first few bars of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" She went over to his desk and asked him, \"Scott, do you know what that is that you're humming?\"   \"Yes,\" he replied. \"It's an old baseball song.\" LEE HAYS                    . . .         When is a window not a window? Ask Ann L. Drinan of Manhattan, who was in the Philadelphia airport recently, reading while she waited for her flight to be called. A middle-aged woman approached and very tentatively said, \"I hope I'm not being too bold, but is your name Heloise?\" Ms. Drinan politely said no, her name was Ann.   The woman explained that she saw Ms. Drinan reading a book about cleaning windows and thought she was Heloise, the household-hint columnist. Well, why not?

Dear Diary:   It is a balmy late-summer evening. While walking down West 18th Street, I stumble upon Book Friends Cafe. A quartet is playing a tune from an old Busby Berkeley movie as I walk in. True to its name, the front is a bookstore, the back a cafe.   As I stand, thumbing through Gracie Fields's autobiography, the quartet strikes up a sultry rumba. Two couples, both in vintage evening dress, rise from their tables and take to the floor, dancing with a grace that Fred and Ginger would have envied. I stare, poleaxed with pleasure, at my own private movie.   A moment of perfect bliss in Manhattan. ELISA DeCARLO                    . . .       DREAMS   Someone    should walk the streets    collecting dreams    since those of us    who work at sleep    seem too tired to do the job.   Somewhere   the task of saving memories must   be recorded. Perhaps a storehouse    might hold them in golden barrels.   Sometimes   in the morning, sturdy souls   forget the nighttime fragments of   black and white recollections   that weave in and out of sunlight   like elusive flashy photographs.   There has to be   a permanent collection,   a museum of dreams.   Somehow. ROGER GRANET                    . . .         Dr. William K. Kopp of Rego Park, Queens, who identifies himself as a single man of 55, says that neither he nor Karen Weitz, his companion of 11 years, has ever felt comfortable with the term \"girlfriend.\" But defining the relationship leads to some amusing moments.   Recently, Dr. Kopp reported, \"Karen spotted my daughter with my 16-month-old grandson, Jonah, playing with friends in the park.\"   \"My daughter introduced Karen to her friends as 'my dad's girlfriend,' \" he continued, \"and then turned to my grandson and said, 'Jonah, say hi to Grandma Karen.'

In the front row at a White House rally this week for GATT -- the international trade accord that the House leadership will try to bring to a vote today -- sat Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, and Brent Scowcroft, its national security adviser. Free trade is a bipartisan policy and, after the cold war, the country's foremost foreign policy. Trade binds disparate nations and creates wealth; the GATT accord is expected to raise world income by $500 billion, and American income alone by $100 billion.    That is why it is important for the House to stop stalling and approve the GATT accord today. The Senate -- because of the unconscionable opposition of a single textile-belt Senator, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina -- must wait until after elections to vote. Once the U.S. ratifies the treaty, more than 100 other nations are likely to follow soon. But delay plays into the hands of protectionists abroad.   Besides die-hard protectionists, some environmental and consumer groups also oppose the accord. These opponents worry that international dispute panels, which oversee enforcement of GATT rules, might undermine U.S. health, safety and environmental laws. But the threat is mostly fictitious -- as a ruling this week by such a dispute panel convincingly proves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941005","headline":"Woman Tells Of Retaliation For Complaint On Tailhook","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/05/us/woman-tells-of-retaliation-for-complaint-on-tailhook.html","abstract":"  Paula A.

One daughter, Aggie, is perennially pregnant, and the other, Martha, has gone through two husbands and may have met her third at the check-out counter of a grocery store.

Images flash of a body bag, a chalk outline of a corpse, \"for sale\" signs, a \"going out of business\" sign. Finally, the camera pans across a rubble-strewn city lot, followed by a grim-looking shot of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (the producers say the photographs were all taken in New York over the last week). SCRIPT -- \"This is Mario Cuomo's New York. Cuomo coddles criminals. Day and night, we are in danger -- on the street, at work, in school, even in our homes. Cuomo imposes crippling taxes. Business withers, jobs disappear, families suffer, dreams die. Cuomo plays politics. Working men and women pay the bills. Twelve years of Mario Cuomo. Can you afford four more? Dump Cuomo. Build New York.\" ACCURACY -- It is true that people can often be in danger in New York, that some businesses wither and that some dreams die, but it is difficult if not impossible to make a case that it is true of New York alone or that Mr. Cuomo is solely responsible. But this dark portrait is not meant as history; it is an emotional summation of the three themes that may defeat Mr. Cuomo: crime, jobs and taxes. SCORECARD -- This ad was financed by the real estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld, but it is as if it came from Dante, depicting New York as hell. There has been bad blood between the two men: in 1986, Mr. Cuomo knocked Mr. Hirschfeld off the ballot when he tried to run for lieutenant governor and last year, Mr. Cuomo successfully opposed Mr. Hirschfeld's attempts to buy the New York Post. Though he says it is not revenge, Mr. Hirschfeld says he is spending from $250,000 to $1 million to broadcast this ad, first in New York City and Albany, then perhaps across the state. Mr. Hirschfeld said he supports the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki (who is not mentioned in the ad), but that his primary reason for the ad was \"to help my fellow man\" by presenting his vision of New York State under Mr. Cuomo.    As a bit of television drama, it makes its case with undeniable force. But some viewers might see it as being so negative, its claims so sweeping, that they might dismiss it entirely.
