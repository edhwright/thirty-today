And so what, if beginning in the 1970's, the P.S.A.T. score determined whether you'd qualify for a National Merit Scholarship?   Certainly Katherine is not going to panic just because most her friends, looking for an edge, already took the P.S.A.T. in 10th grade, as a warm-up for this warm-up. And what if they did spend last weekend taking Princeton Review's new P.S.A.T. prep course and ordered the brand new pay-per-view P.S.A.T.-S.A.T. course on cable television? Nervous? Please. \"Yes, I am nervous!\" Katherine said. \"I don't have my Dad's faith in me.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19931013","headline":"Generosity Of Officer Is Recalled At Funeral","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/13/nyregion/generosity-of-officer-is-recalled-at-funeral.html","abstract":"  Officer John Williamson was buried yesterday on a raw, rain-chilled day, as his friends, relatives, and those who knew him only from afar tried to make sense of his death.

When every last whistle-stop and handshake is thoroughly documented in print and on television, can there be anything more for a film maker to find? When D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus set out to chronicle the Clinton campaign, they were treading on familiar territory, taking on a seemingly redundant task. And yet \"The War Room,\" their glimpse of behind-the-scenes maneuvers among Clinton strategists, finds new facets of the story and manages to coax cliffhanging suspense out of a fait accompli.   However much \"The War Room\" reveals about how Mr. Clinton won the election, its real subject is why he won. The true focus of this watchful, frankly admiring film is the Clinton campaign staff, with James Carville and George Stephanopoulos receiving star billing. The film presents these two as tireless new-breed strategists whose fast, aggressive tactics helped to reshape their party's political thinking, and who themselves played a high-profile role in the election.  Theirs was an attitude that promised something different in Presidential politics, and this film examines that attitude in riveting detail.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931013","headline":"Doctors Can't Override Dying Patients' Wishes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/13/opinion/l-doctors-can-t-override-dying-patients-wishes-967093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Those who follow the development of bioethical issues in New York State know Dr. Timothy E.

Spoken by someone black, it can pass as a simple greeting or even a term of endearment. Spoken by someone white, the word is almost universally heard as an insult. Like it or not, blacks have carved out a historical exemption allowing raw talk about race -- though primarily among themselves.

Some players never make that adjustment.   One reason for such a shift is to reach a more productive trump suit, perhaps 4-4 rather than 5-3. Another is to place the declaration in the hand that is protected against a damaging lead.

where Abraham, Sarah and the Patriarchs are buried -- never actually sees a cave. It is covered with layers of construction: a wall erected by Herod, the remnants of a Byzantine church, a 12th-century mosque. Inside that mosque both Jews and Moslems now come to worship, with an Israeli army presence preventing conflict. No one knows what lies underneath the mosque's floor.   In \"The Cave,\" a work of opera, theater and video that received its American premiere at the Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night, Steve Reich and Beryl Korot are preoccupied with the cultural counterparts of such layers of accumulation and appropriation. The work received its first performance last spring in Vienna and was commissioned by seven organizations (including the academy). It is divided into three acts. Each deals with a different group of people -- Israeli Jews, Palestinian Muslims and Americans -- reacting to the same questions: Who for you is Abraham? Who for you is Sarah? Hagar? Ishmael? Isaac? The cave Abraham purchased as a burial site for Sarah is a recurrent image.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931015","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/us/inside-432793.html","abstract":"  Sprayed by Police, Man Dies   A Mount Vernon man died after officers subdued him with pepper spray and he went into cardiac arrest.

Washington Text: (Voiceover) Whitman and Florio. Compare. Christie Whitman wants to cut state spending. Jim Florio increased spending by three billion dollars. Christie Whitman wants to create new jobs with tax cuts. Jim Florio raised taxes billions and he won't rule out raising taxes again. Whitman will clean up state Government. Florio's administration is under two grand jury investigations. Jim Florio. Rising unemployment, corruption, high taxes. We can't afford more. Christie Whitman. A change for the better. Visual: Still photos of Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio appear side by side -- predictably she is smiling engagingly while he is frosty -- while graphics echo the truncated words of the narrator. Her image disappears when the specter of corruption is mentioned, replaced at the Governor's side by stacks of money and news headlines reading \"State Jobless Rate Reaches 7.7 % For Second Rise in a Row\" and \"Lax Ethical Standards.\" Analysis: What's new here is the odor of corruption. In earlier television spots, Mrs. Whitman tried to saddle Mr. Florio with all the bad effects of a prolonged recession while contrasting the $2.8 billion tax increases he pushed through the Legislature in 1980 with her campaign promise to cut taxes by $1.4 billion. (Mrs. Whitman herself refuses to sign a no-new-taxes pledge.) While mention of the two grand juries is fair game, equating them with proof of corruption is not, and Mrs. Whitman's pledge \"to clean up state Government\" not only lacks specifics but means little without evidence that it is dirty. A state grand jury is looking into allegations that $1.5 million in excess state school aid was sent to the Democratic-controlled town of Lyndhurst , which GOP partisans have painted as a political payoff ordered by the Governor's office. Meanwhile, a Federal grand jury has been examining the old practice, unique to neither party, of directing profitable state bond business to Wall Street fat cats who make hefty campaign contributions to the party in power. The fly in Mr. Florio's ointment here is that Joseph C. Salema Jr., his chief of staff and political satrap, was a partner in a bond consulting firm that profited handsomely from state decisions.

Dinkins back on the defensive, Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials and two similar radio ads, harshly attacking the Mayor's record in office and a range of personal or professional lapses dating back two decades. This is one of them. ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with big words on screen \"Maybe we should have known better,\" next to a tiny picture of Mr. Giuliani noting that his campaign paid for it. Followed by pictures of a Comptroller's report, and a quotation from it: \"...serious internal control weaknesses over revenue...\" Then newspaper headlines, title noting that Mr. Dinkins failed to file tax returns from 1969 through 1972, footage of Korean boycott, Crown Heights, asbestos sign on a dumpster, and titles that repeat much of the narration. It ends with a picture of Mr. Dinkins, with a smirky smile, and the words \"It's not my fault.\" Last image: White letters on black background, \"Maybe it was our fault four years ago.\" PRODUCER: Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT:  Male narrator: \"Maybe we should have known better. When David Dinkins was City Clerk, a Comptroller audit found that his office was a financial mess. He also forgot to pay Federal, state and city income taxes four years in a row. You think you'd get away with it? Then he becomes Mayor, and we get the Korean boycott, the Crown Heights riots, the PVB scandal, asbestos in the schools and on top of that, we lose 350,000 jobs. And all David Dinkins says is, it's not my fault. Maybe he's right. Maybe it was our fault four years ago.\" ACCURACY: Two audits by the City Comptroller did fault the management of the City Clerk's office during Mr. Dinkins's tenure from 1975 to 1985. He failed to file income tax returns and pay all taxes due from 1969 through 1972, but he later paid the taxes with penalities and there was no prosecution. As one of the Giuliani radio ads notes, the lapse prevented Mr. Dinkins from becoming the city's first black deputy Mayor in 1973. The school asbestos problem long predated the Mayor's tenure in office, and economists say the city government cannot be held accountable for all the jobs lost in a severe regional recession. Moreover, Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged fault in several of the cases cited, particularly with respect to Crown Heights. SCORECARD: This tough ad attacks Mr. Dinkins for a range of old and new lapses, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink. It is Mr. Giuliani's attempt to counteract the Dinkins ads that have sought to rehash old aspects of his record of service to Republican administrations and link them to his current policy views. Similarly, this ad attempts to paint Mr. Dinkins's entire career as an endless skein of mediocrity and bumbling -- typified by his failure to pay income taxes. The \"You think you'd get away with it?\" line is an indirect echo of a charge the Giuliani camp sometimes makes more overtly: that if Mr. Dinkins were white, he would never have been forgiven such a lapse. That is a way of saying whites need not feel guilty for voting against him now, having given him a break four years ago. By citing the most notable crises of the Dinkins administration, the ad may ring uncomfortably true. But its rapid-fire mix of images and charges, and its final sneering tone of blaming the electorate may also put voters off.<? TODD S.
