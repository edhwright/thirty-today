Deep in the dark recesses of the Presidential mind is clearly the knowledge, albeit a bit rusty, of what it takes to be an improvising musician. \"Well, tunes in 3/4 time have a built-in rhythmic excitement,\" President Clinton said afterwards, casually.  \"You just have to ride them.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930621","headline":"Bolivia's Rain Forest Falls to Relentless Exploiters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/21/world/bolivia-s-rain-forest-falls-to-relentless-exploiters.html","abstract":"  Almost daily here in Bolivia's dense Amazon jungle, above the sound of the rushing river, the squawking of macaws and the scolding of monkeys, the Mojeno Indians hear the buzz of chain saws slicing through six-foot-thick mahogany trees.

But another 35 to 40 party members, who led the rebellion that forced a no-confidence vote against Mr. Miyazawa through Parliament on Friday, is expected to announce later this week that it is also forming a rival party.

The idea that a doomsday rock did in the dinosaurs was first proposed in 1980 by Dr. Walter Alvarez, a geologist at the University of California at Berkeley.

Some of these are honest reformers, outraged at the Liberal Democrats' failure to meet the public demand for a cleaner system. Others are opportunists, betting on political realignment as the quickest ticket to the rewards of high office.    It's high drama -- the fracturing of a system of one-party rule that delivered remarkable economic growth and endured for almost 40 years. But beneath the choreographed rituals of Japanese party politics lie even more dramatic changes in public opinion. A new generation of urban Japanese, raised in affluence, is now turning against big-money politics while it seeks a better balance between producer and consumer interests in Japanese life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930622","headline":"Electrical Emissions: Dangerous Or Not?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/science/electrical-emissions-dangerous-or-not.html","abstract":"ELECTROMAGNETIC fields, linked for more than a decade, however tenuously, with cancer in children, have become the stuff of nightmares. Entrepreneurs have been doing a brisk business selling devices to measure EMF's, as they are known, in the home or office. And utility companies are quietly spending $1 billion a year nationwide to reduce exposures from their power lines and facilities, while preparing to face a barrage of lawsuits holding them responsible for childhood cancers.\n\nBut in a recent lawsuit in San Diego, the first such case to go to trial, a jury rejected a couple's claim that their 5-year-old daughter's rare form of kidney cancer had been caused by the tangle of power lines hanging ominously above their home. The San Diego case raised the question of just how strong the scientific evidence is linking electromagnetic fields and cancer, and whether the public's anxiety is valid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930622","headline":"Supreme Court Roundup; Justices to Decide if Ash Is a Hazardous Waste","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-to-decide-if-ash-is-a-hazardous-waste.html","abstract":"  In a case that could help determine the economics of municipal waste disposal, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the ash left from the burning of municipal solid waste must be treated as hazardous waste, requiring special treatment that could increase the cost of disposal by as much as 10 times.

The vote in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council was 8 to 1. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the dissent. FROM THE DECISION By Justice Stevens    The President has directed the Coast Guard to intercept vessels illegally transporting passengers from Haiti to the United States and to return those passengers to Haiti without first determining whether they may qualify as refugees. The question presented in this case is whether such forced repatriation, \"authorized to be undertaken only beyond the territorial sea of the United States,\" violates Sections 243(h)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (I.N.A. or Act). We hold that neither Sections 243(h) nor Article 33 of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees applies to action taken by the Coast Guard on the high seas.                    . . .         Aliens residing illegally in the United States are subject to deportation after a formal hearing. Aliens arriving at the border, or those who are temporarily paroled into the country, are subject to an exclusion hearing, the less formal process by which they, too, may eventually be removed from the United States. In either a deportation or exclusion proceeding the alien may seek asylum as a political refugee for whom removal to a particular country may threaten his life or freedom. Requests that the Attorney General grant asylum or withhold deportation to a particular country are typically, but not necessarily, advanced as parallel claims in either a deportation or an exclusion proceeding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930622","headline":"Kate Reid Memorial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/arts/kate-reid-memorial.html","abstract":"  A memorial service for the actress Kate Reid is to be held next Tuesday at 11 A.M. at St. Clement's Church Theater, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton.

The cardinals, they said, acted en masse after previous visits to Vatican officials by Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia did not produce any sign that church law might be adjusted or streamlined so that American bishops could act more swiftly and decisively against molesting priests.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930622","headline":"The Politics of Meaning : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/opinion/IHT-the-politics-of-meaning-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Michael Kelly's articles on Hillary Rodham Clinton (May 25 and 26) and her \"politics of meaning\" missed the point.

The Americans went ahead on goals by Chris Henderson in the 20th minute, Peter Vermes in the 36th minute and Dominic Kinnear in the 51st. But Jose Dolgetta scored in the 65th and 77th minutes and Miguel Echanaussi in the final minute. The United States, 2-8-10 this year, was playing for the first time in the America Cup, South America's biennial championship. The Americans, who are missing most of their good players, previously lost to Uruguay, 1-0, and Ecuador, 2-0, and had been the only team not to score in the tournament. The tie clinched advancement to the quarterfinals for Uruguay (1-0-1), which played Ecuador late last night. Venezuela (0-1-2) is unlikely to advance as one of the two-best third-place teams because of a minus-5 goal differential.

The fleet, separated into 14 divisions, managed two races yesterday in 12-23-knot breezes. Dennis Conner, sailing his 60-foot yacht, Winston, crossed the finish line first in both races as an unofficial entry. Conner, four-time defender of the America's Cup, said last week that he was using Race Week as a shakedown series for Winston.

The Blue Jays displayed how pivotal it is to win at home, how crucial it is to remain steady when the deficit is sizable in the early innings, how important it is to rally and how integral it is to win, just win, when you have the lead in the late innings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930623","headline":"Book Notes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/books/book-notes-708793.html","abstract":"  Taking Big Chances   To many publishers, the delay of Oprah Winfrey's autobiography, which was summarily yanked by the talk-show host just three months before its scheduled publication date, was a chilling reminder of the perils of publishing books by celebrities.   Such books can be incredibly lucrative, particularly for a publishing house that hopes to subsidize a strong but unglamorous list with a blockbuster or two. Alfred A. Knopf had planned to print 750,000 copies of Ms. Winfrey's book in hard cover, and people in the industry estimated that the book could have brought in a staggering $15 million to $20 million. But the pitfalls of planning such a book are numerous, not least because many celebrities seem to work in their own orbits, with their own agendas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930623","headline":"Human Rights Would Lose in a Beijing Olympiad","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/opinion/IHT-human-rights-would-lose-in-a-beijing-olympiad.html","abstract":"Among the six cities bidding to be host to the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney and Beijing are the acknowledged front-runners.

Automobile traffic is only part of the problem. Roughly half the world's energy consumption goes into the construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. Architects don't initiate this gross consumption, but some of them have begun to recognize that design can help curtail it.  The choice of building materials, use of renewable resources like natural light and ventilation, and controlled patterns of suburban growth are some of the strategies architects can adopt toward what is called sustainable development: design that provides shelter without environmental or human exploitation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930623","headline":"Legislative Chiefs Agree to Extend Rent Rules Briefly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/nyregion/legislative-chiefs-agree-to-extend-rent-rules-briefly.html","abstract":"  For the second time in a week, Senate and Assembly leaders agreed today to extend the state's rent regulations for a brief period while they continue discussing whether to weaken regulations on certain luxury apartments.
