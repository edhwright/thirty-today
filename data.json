In this 1945 work, which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Monday evening after an 11-year absence, certainties are few and ambiguities abound. That puts it in sharp contrast to most of the Met's fare, operas in which heroes are heroes and villains are villains. Given the straightforward simplicity of Tyrone Guthrie's 1967 production and a strong cast that comes to the music with original, if sometimes debatable, interpretive ideas, this \"Grimes\" makes an unusually provocative evening of theater.   Mainly, it keeps one guessing about Britten's intentions. Grimes, a gruff Suffolk fisherman whose young apprentices are prone to fatal accidents, stands defiantly apart from a hypocritical, oppressive society. Britten identified strongly with that, and there is a degree to which Grimes is shown as that quintessential 19th-century loner-hero, the misunderstood artist. \"I can see the shoals to which the rest are blind,\" Grimes declares, striking the classic pose of the Romantic artist glimpsing truths beyond mortal vision.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"The Pop Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/arts/the-pop-life-105074.html","abstract":"  Down Time for Etheridge    Melissa Etheridge has been on the road for a year and a half without a break.

That program raised the question, echoed tonight, of whether the efforts to save Mr. Otey were a tribute to America's justice system or a waste of time and resources.   In 1978, Mr. Otey was convicted of the murder of a 26-year-old Nebraska woman, largely on the basis of his graphic description of how he had stabbed and smothered her and then hit her a few times with a hammer just to be sure she was dead. Later he said the confession had been coerced, but his volunteer lawyer, who is at the center of tonight's account, does not take that tack. Granting that his client might have done the deed, Victor Covalt argues that Mr. Otey should live because in his years on death row he studied philosophy and wrote poetry and was now a different man from the one who murdered Jane McManus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"In TV Age, Fifth Graders Fall in Love With the Written Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/nyregion/in-tv-age-fifth-graders-fall-in-love-with-the-written-word.html","abstract":"  Something extraordinary happens every day in Kathleen Tolan's fifth-grade classroom at Public School 125, the Ralph J.

This unvarnished view, free of editing and commentary, has not always flattered government. It has also given rise to a new breed of couch potato: the C-Span junkie.   The next House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, adroitly used C-Span in his rise to power.

Yet the sheer oddity of the whole affair left one in a kind of daze. There was the shouting match that broke out in the balconies immediately after the concert began; there was the perplexing presence of Ursula Oppens, the formidable new-music specialist, as accompanist; there was the fluctuating quality of the soprano's own voice, alternately beautiful and bland. Whatever it was, it wasn't dull.   This was Miss Battle's second recital in New York since her abrupt dismissal from the Metropolitan Opera last February. Her operatic engagements have dwindled markedly in the last few years, and it would seem that the notoriously temperamental soprano is concentrating her energies on solo recitals.  When she sang at Carnegie Hall shortly after the Met incident, her accompanist was James Levine; for this occasion, she collaborated with Miss Oppens, who could not be further from the Met's world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"A Woman Within a Wild Child, As Revealed by Jodie Foster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/movies/film-review-nell-a-woman-within-a-wild-child-as-revealed-by-jodie-foster.html","abstract":"Carolina woodswoman.

After unification, the Government loosened some of the restrictions West Germany had placed on abortion, until the country's highest court stepped in.

The crash of an American Eagle Jetstream Super 31 on Tuesday night, killing 15 of the 20 people aboard, increased the pressure for changes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941215","headline":"Meola Signs With Buffalo Pro Team","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/sports/sports-people-soccer-meola-signs-with-buffalo-pro-team.html","abstract":"  TONY MEOLA, the goaltender for the United States World Cup team, signed yesterday with the Buffalo Blizzard of the National Professional Soccer League.

By the T.V.A.'s reckoning, these were the last nuclear units still under construction in the nation. The T.V.A. once had the most ambitious nuclear program in the country, with 17 reactors on order. But as it turned out, the agency built only five nuclear units, of which only three are currently operating.   The reasons for the latest abandonment are the same that curtailed other nuclear construction around the country -- ballooning costs and uncertainty about when plants could finally be brought on line. Although the T.V.A. had already spent $6.3 billion on the units and they were from 57 percent to 88 percent completed, the authority estimated it could cost up to $8.8 billion more to finish the job. That was simply too much when it already felt overburdened with debt, some 44 percent of which had been spent on its nuclear program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941215","headline":"Journal; The Key to the City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/opinion/journal-the-key-to-the-city.html","abstract":"  On New Year's Eve, thousands of revelers, tourists and scoundrels will once again gather in Times Square to watch the ball drop, and millions more will watch on TV.

Inside a flickering candlelit pleasure dome, they are plied with wine and meat by aggressive prostitutes who wear bizarre, towering headdresses. Within minutes, the monks have broken most of the 10 prohibitions that were solemnly taught them by a 10-year-old holy man.    Midway in the orgy, General Shi (Wu Hsin-kuo), a warrior who has disguised himself as a monk, is led by his sometime lover Princess Scarlet (Joan Chen) into an inner sanctum with a bathing pool. As they begin to make love, they are joined by drunken monks and prostitutes laughing and thrashing around wildly. The revels are cut short when the child monk reveals that there is a 10,000-tael reward for Shi's arrest and removal to the imperial capital.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Mexico Sets Up a Panel to Respond to Rebels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/world/mexico-sets-up-a-panel-to-respond-to-rebels.html","abstract":"  The Government has formed a multi-party legislative commission to resolve the conflict with rebels in Chiapas and to ease tensions that have reached their highest level.

Backed by orchestras and choirs or small pop-jazz groups, she shows off the creamy voice that her disco hits never revealed.

Otherwise he risked being entirely marginalized in the legislative combat that begins on Jan. 4 when the Gingrich-Dole whirlwind hits Congress. As the rumblings from the House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt, suggest, Mr. Clinton also faces a crisis of anxiety within his own party. At a minimum, his speech probably showed Democrats that he had the stomach for the difficult task of self-rejuvenation.   Given the size of that task, a speech of only 10 minutes did not bespeak much in the way of confidence, but the President looked more focused than he has in recent weeks. Mr. Clinton must be nagged by a sense of lost opportunities. In 23 months, he has skidded from initiator to imitator.

Yet vastly more plutonium is generated as spent nuclear fuel in civilian power plants. Some of it is being reprocessed for use as fuel for commercial reactors, when in fact low-enriched uranium will do. Plutonium can be used in bombs; its reprocessing needs to be curtailed.    Washington can begin that effort now. It is renegotiating a 1958 agreement with Euratom, the European Union's atomic energy agency, which is due to expire at the end of next year. Under that arrangement, U.S. companies have supplied the Europeans with low-enriched uranium for use in their power plants.

If there is no resolution of the strike, Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner said, \"next Thursday or Friday morning at 12:01 A.M., the implementation process will begin.\" The owners' 25-3 vote today gave the executive council, which Selig heads, the authority to declare an impasse and implement the clubs' final offer, the salary cap they proposed Nov. 17.     The decision was contingent on the union's agreement to postpone two deadlines dealing with player contracts. Donald Fehr, the union chief, said from New York he would recommend to the players' executive board that the union agree to the postponements.   Although Selig and John Harrington, chairman of the negotiating committee, emphasized that the owners acted solely in the interest of negotiating an agreement with the players, the decision raised the possibility at least that the owners became concerned that if they had acted today, they would have been declaring an impasse in the talks prematurely.   When the clubs' negotiators left Rye Brook, N.Y., on Wednesday, they were in the middle of perhaps the most promising period of the talks since negotiations began in earnest six months ago.   If the owners had declared an impasse today, they might have strengthened the union's challenge of the move before the National Labor Relations Board. An employer can declare an impasse in talks any time he chooses, but he has to be prepared to defend the action in the face of a union challenge.   The owners initially had scheduled the meeting to act on implementation for Dec. 5, but they emerged from a bargaining session in Leesburg, Va., on Nov. 30 and announced they had agreed to postpone the meeting for 10 days to give negotiations additional time to work. At the time, it appeared they had acted at the urging of Bill Usery Jr., the mediator.   But some management people since have suggested that the owners themselves wanted to delay the meeting and the vote.   Although Usery said last week that implementation would be \"very, very unfortunate,\" Harrington said today that the mediator had not asked the owners to delay their vote again.   \"He just asked us not to do anything or say anything that would preclude continuing collective bargaining in the spirit we had conducted collective bargaining,\" Harrington said at a news conference at the O'Hare Hilton. \"I think he will be surprised at this move.\"   Selig did not identify the three clubs that voted no. However, Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles was on record as saying he would oppose implementation, and the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers or the New York Mets were believed to be the other two clubs with negative votes.   Obviously, the overwhelming majority of owners are eager to implement the salary cap if the two sides are unable to reach agreement on a new collective bargaining contract. But they also don't want to put themselves at risk legally.   Taking the positive approach, Selig said: \"If there's a scintilla of a chance to have a meaningful solution at the table, you've got to try it. If you fail, you try again.\"   Fehr said it was positive that the owners were willing to continue negotiations without a salary cap in place. But he added, \"I can't tell you what it will lead to.\"   He said the union would hold internal meetings this weekend, then be prepared to resume negotiations on Monday. The talks, he said, could be held in Washington, Usery's home turf.   Reacting to Harrington's characterization of the owners' move as an olive branch, Fehr said, \"I hope it turns out to be one.\"   As to what might have happened to change the atmosphere, he said: \"There were some discussions that seemed to be of a more constructive tone. And I think everybody agrees on that.\"   Talks had been stalled on the union's refusal to accept a salary cap or a luxury tax on payrolls that could act like a cap. The owners removed their latest tax proposal, the one they made last Sunday in reply to a players' proposal 24 hours earlier, from the table Tuesday in Rye Brook.   \"We're back to a salary cap,\" they told union negotiators.   But during a bargaining session late Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, the clubs' representatives, for the first time, indicated that they might have some flexibility on the way they would tax payrolls.    That idea caught the players' attention, and the two sides returned to the table Wednesday afternoon in a more hopeful manner. But while the union offered seemingly conciliatory ideas on elements of the owners' revenue-sharing plan that is linked to a salary cap, it did not produce a proposal the owners' negotiators said they expected and were waiting for.   The management team ended the talks at that point and flew here for today's meeting.   \"On the way in,\" Harrington related, \"we reviewed all the alternatives that were available to us. We met again this morning at 9 o'clock. The committee concluded on a unanimous basis to make the recommendation we made to the full ownership. It was done in the spirit of opening one more window of opportunity.\"   Harrington said the owners' willingness \"to walk through those doors of deadlines and open them again should show we're dead-set to negotiate a resolution of this dispute.\"   The two deadlines in question deal with clubs' salary arbitration offers to retain rights to their free agents plus the players' responses and the tendering of contracts to unsigned players on clubs' 40-man rosters.   The arbitration offer deadline was Dec. 7 and the response deadline on Monday. On Nov. 30, those were pushed back to Dec. 17 and 23. Clubs must tender contracts to unsigned players by Dec. 20. The new deadline for and tenders is Dec. 23. The deadline for players response to arbitration offers most likely will be Jan. 4. But the arbitration offers will become immaterial if the clubs implement a salary cap.   In all of his talk about the clubs' fervent desire to negotiate a new system rather than implementing one, Selig sounded one ominous note.   \"If the union really wants to reach an agreement,\" Selig said, \"we're going to give it more time, but it must address our central issue -- establishing a relationship between revenues and salaries.\"   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Shopping and Weather:The Holiday Mood on City Streets : Hong Kong","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/style/IHT-shopping-and-weatherthe-holiday-mood-on-city-streets-hong-kong.html","abstract":"Christmas is tough for taitais - which means Mrs. in Mandarin but in its common use refers to women who already have time to shop every day of the year.

As the enfant terrible of the New Wave and the alter ego of directors like Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean Eustache and Jerzy Skolimowski, Mr. Leaud remains forever associated with youth: his, theirs and ours.\n\nWhatever damage the image of an aging Mr. Leaud does to our narcissistic fantasies, it is a tribute to his own resources that he has survived the versions of himself imposed by others and can now claim a retrospective of his own. In \"Growing Up With Jean-Pierre Leaud, Nouvelle Vague's Wild Child,\" a 14-film series beginning today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, a new generation of filmgoers will be able to discover afresh this most tantalizingly transparent of actors in his cinematic journey from the wild child of Truffaut to the father of a wild child in Olivier Assayas's \"Paris at Dawn.\" And those of us who, in the context of 1960's and 70's film culture, saw the actor more as an extension of different auteurs than a person in his own right, can now assess what distinguishes Mr. Godard's Leaud from Truffaut's Antoine Doinel, and how both are modified and expanded by Mr. Skolimowski and Eustache, and later by such heirs of the New Wave as Philippe Garrel, Mr. Assayas and Aki Kaurismaki.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Jockeys and Track Group To Meet on Insurance Pact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/sports/jockeys-and-track-group-to-meet-on-insurance-pact.html","abstract":"Amid signs that the two sides are moving closer to a resolution, representatives of the Jockeys' Guild and the Thoroughbred Racing Associations will meet in Manhattan today in an attempt to complete a new contract regarding insurance for the riders.\n\nThe current contract expires at midnight on Dec. 31.

So closely is Josef Albers identified with his influential \"Homage to the Square\" that his lively, varied prints can't help but come as a surprise. There are plenty of straight lines to be seen, but organic curves predominate, from the woodcut titled \"Encircled\" (1933), with its jazzy Art Deco arabesque, to the drypoint titled \"Nippon\" (1942), its squiggly lines looking like threads dropped across a page.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"For Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/arts/for-children.html","abstract":"  'Pierrot and Pirouette'   The Ballroom  253 West 28th Street  Chelsea  (212) 371-6695  Recommended ages: 6 and up  Through Dec. 30    Any children's play with a French title is bound to make you think \"ooh la la.\" This modernized fairy tale, presented by the New York Family Theater Festival, is done with mime, ballet, clowning and recorded music. The story is a blend of happiness and melancholia, with the sadness (there is a death at the end) possibly upsetting sensitive children.

There is a misconception that he is only just this laid-back guy. He can get on you when you need someone to get on you. He has a good feel for when to get on you and when to support you.
