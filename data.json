Improvements in gas mileage have slowed the market's growth, industry experts say, but in the New York area a steady population and abundant mass transit have also kept gasoline consumption down. Retail prices have fallen slightly in the past few years. Disparities in gas prices in different areas are largely due to tax differences and the costs of doing business. State gas taxes in the region vary; New York State also imposes a 4 percent sales tax on gasoline.

By late September, the Republican nomination belonged to a political maverick; the incumbent was running as a third-party candidate, and Mr. Schiliro had taken a leave of absence from his Capitol Hill job, a last-minute replacement for a weaker Democrat in the race.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941031","headline":"Long Shot on Casinos Is Taken Seriously in Florida","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/31/us/1994-campaign-ballot-measures-long-shot-casinos-taken-seriously-florida.html","abstract":"  Half an hour after setting out from Fort Lauderdale, the cruise ship Discovery I crosses into international waters and the casually dressed crowd scatters among the gaming tables and slot machines that suddenly come to life.

It was cold, windy and rainy at Soldier Field on this Halloween night, but none of that was as chilling to the Chicago Bears as the whipping dispensed by the Green Bay Packers. The Bears started slowly and finished that way. The Packers started with a few slips but finished upright, thwarting the Bears by 33-6. - \"I've never played in conditions like that. It was like playing in Hurricane Camille, except it was 80 degrees cooler,\" said Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, who ran for one touchdown and passed for another. \"It was unbelievable. I went out in pregame and said, 'I might not complete a pass,' and I almost lived up to it.\"   Green Bay led by 14-0 at halftime and never looked back in scoring the game's first 27 points. The finishing touches were a 1-yard, third-quarter run by Edgar Bennett and, in the final quarter, a Bennett 13-yard score on a swing pass from Favre and a 9-yard scoring run by Reggie Cobb. For Bennett, it was a three-touchdown night.   Chicago -- which entered this game averaging only 18.4 points scored per game and had not scored more than 22 points in any game this season -- knew it was in trouble after falling behind, regardless of the terrible weather.   Quarterback Erik Kramer was ineffective and was replaced by Steve Walsh to begin the second half. Walsh finally connected, in between the Packers final two touchdowns -- with receiver Jeff Graham on a 5-yard pass that was the Bears' only score.   In this huge game for strong midseason standing in the National Football Conference Central race, Chicago slipped to a 4-4 record and Green Bay matched that mark. Both are tied with Detroit for second place behind the Minnesota Vikings (6-2).   There was one highlight for the Bears: at halftime, in an upbeat ceremony, the numbers of the Bears greats Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers were retired. Chicago finished with five turnovers, the Packers with none.   This was not a game for the faint of heart. At kickoff, the temperature was 43 degrees, the winds gusted up to 53 miles an hour and the windchill factor made the temperature seem 8 degrees. The Bears had their 91st consecutive sellout -- admittedly with 19,563 no-shows -- but more than half the crowd had left by halftime because of the weather.   It was an important and emotional game for Steve McMichael. For the last 23 meetings between these two teams, McMichael had lined up at defensive tackle for the Bears. This time, the 15-year pro, because of a free agent move to Green Bay in the off season, was on the line for the Packers.   It figured that the team that could establish a running game and stick with it would have the upper hand early and late in this 149th clash between the colorful rivals. Turnovers, however, played as large a role in the Packers rumbling to a 14-0 halftime lead.   The Packers found the running on the left side to their liking. The matchup there was left tackle Ken Ruettgers, left guard Guy McIntyre and center Frank Winters versus the Bear right end Alonzo Spellman and right tackle Chris Zorich. It was a matchup the Packers steadily won, with that left side leading Green Bay to a 223-94 lead in rushing yardage.   Favre was 0 for 7 passing until late in the third quarter but he scampered for 36 yards down the right sideline and dove in on the final yard for the touchdown and a 14-0 Green Bay lead with 4:46 left in the half.

But the welfare waiver would involve only 21,000 of the more than one million New Yorkers receiving welfare grants, and the Medicaid help would require Congressional approval that would be difficult to win.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941101","headline":"A Woman With an Eye For Talent and Revolt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/theater/theater-review-a-woman-with-an-eye-for-talent-and-revolt.html","abstract":"  \"Mother of All the Behans\" is one of those celebrations of Irish lore, song and dance that often tend to leave the uninitiated feeling a bit left out.

But six months later, another group of scientists analyzing another Greenland ice sample suggested that the last interglacial period, which began around 130,000 years ago and lasted 10,000 years by most reckonings, appeared stable after all.

Pataki PRODUCER: Russo, Marsh & Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va. VISUAL: Photographs of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Shoreham nuclear plant, plus newspaper headlines and highlights of the script over ominous music. Ends with photograph of Mr. Cuomo scratching his head. SCRIPT: Announcer: \"First, Mario Cuomo cut a cynical deal to buy votes with a $9 billion bailout of Lilco. Now he's cut another deal -- for Rudy Giuliani's support. Just three days after Giuliani's endorsement, The New York Times reported that Giuliani is already counting on $150 million more of your state tax dollars. Billions for Lilco, hundreds of millions for Giuliani and tax increases for us. Don't let Mario Cuomo buy this election with your money.\" ACCURACY: The Governor has proposed a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, which would cost about $9 billion, to be financed through tax-exempt bonds. Politicians of many stripes and the financial markets greeted the idea skeptically. Mr. Cuomo contends a takeover would lead to lower electric rates, by eliminating shareholder dividends and Federal taxes the utility now pays. Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget modification, announced a day after his endorsement of the Governor, does depend on $150 million in new aid from Albany, although he and Mr. Cuomo insist they never discussed any deal, and no governor can deliver much in the way of state aid without the cooperation of the Legislature. Mr. Cuomo has proposed no tax increases. SCORECARD: Mr. Pataki is vulnerable to the charge -- by Mr. Giuliani and other local officials -- that his proposed state income tax cuts would force higher local taxes. This ad tries to turn that attack around, arguing that Mr. Cuomo is the taxer who is pitting different parts of the state against each other. In making that claim, of course, Mr. Pataki seeks to divide the state further, and energize his base in the upstate areas that have provided a growing share of the electorate.  The ad's anti-tax message could hit home, as does its suggestion that the Lilco plan is an election-year gambit. But its conspiracy theory may strike voters as hard to believe, and it does nothing to sketch in Mr. Pataki's own personality or ideas. TODD S.

Cuomo (paid for by the New York State Democratic Committee) PRODUCER Axelrod & Associates, Chicago and Washington ON THE SCREEN Black-and-white scenes of State Senator George E. Pataki, Pat Robertson and a newspaper headline reading \"George is 100 percent 'right' according to Pat Robertson,\" then of assault weapons laid out together, as white letters on black background come zooming into view to highlight parts of script over ominous music. SCRIPT Announcer: \"The more you learn about George Pataki's friends, the more you wonder. As a State Senator, Pataki won the top rating from Pat Robertson's radical coalition, which preaches a ban on abortion and wants creationism taught in our schools. And now, the National Rifle Association's endorsed Pataki, who's opposed tougher gun laws, like the ban on assault weapons. The N.R.A., Pat Robertson and the radical right. If George Pataki's their man, can he really be ours?\" ACCURACY In 1993, Mr. Pataki did receive a 100 percent rating from the Christian Coalition, based on four votes: Medicaid funding for abortions, a bill that finances the Medicaid program through aid to local governments, the section of the budget that provided for postponing scheduled tax cuts and a bill on child pornography. This year, his rating was 83 percent. Mr. Pataki supports abortion rights, though he has voted consistently for restrictions. He says he supports a ban on assault weapons, but in April he voted against an amendment to a gun-licensing bill that included sharp restrictions on a number of assault weapons. At first, he denied the vote, then said it was procedural and now says it was a partisan vote with the Republican majority on a measure that did not go far enough. SCORECARD This is one of the harshest ads of the race, produced and paid for by the State Democratic Committee in part because the Governor's media adviser, David Garth, has opposed making such attacks. But for weeks now, Mr. Cuomo has sought to define Mr. Pataki as out of step with a state that retains a strong plurality of Democratic voters likely to reject a strongly conservative candidate, and polls suggest the Governor's attacks have been working. The risk is that the imputed link between Mr. Pataki and the Christian right is tenuous, and voters may be put off by the tough tone. TODD S.

In an era of sharp cutbacks in government services, and when entitlement programs soak up ever greater portions of government budgets, the net burden of high levels of immigration can no longer be supported. The sentiments of Emma Lazarus's anthem -- to send us your huddled masses -- are simply no longer economically possible or desirable.   American incomes have been stagnant for the last 20 years. The taxpaying population is in revolt and any new taxes to support transfer payments and new social programs are not politically feasible. The impact of population growth on cities and states is demonstrable.   California estimates that the net cost of illegal immigration to the state's taxpayers is more than $3.5 billion. In New York City, the school population has grown by more than 20 percent in the last three years, a phenomenon that is almost entirely immigration-driven.    While immigrants do contribute to the economy, their net impact is negative, especially if they cannot enter the more skilled professions. As welfare reform becomes more urgent, the competition and friction between illegal immigrants and citizens who must integrate into the work force at lower skill levels will become more intense.   The country can no longer support the present legal immigration of 700,000 people annually, let alone illegal immigration levels that push total annual immigration into the millions. Quality of life and environmental and economic realities dictate that even our current population of 260 million consumes too much of the earth's limited resources.   A halt to illegal immigration and a reduction of legal immigration are urgently needed. If both can be accomplished, the natural birth rate of the United States will eventually reverse our population to more sustainable levels.    You place misty-eyed ideology before hard reality in attacking California's Proposition 187. Some of its provisions may be unconstitutional, but its real import is that it is placing the question of out-of-control immigration policy squarely in the center of public discourse where it belongs.

VIRGINIA -- A computer check of state and Federal election commission reports by the Rainbow Coalition has found that more than 40 contributors to previous political campaigns of David Duke in Louisiana have donated a combined $38,000 -- more than twice what they gave Mr. Duke -- to Oliver L. North, the Republican trying to unseat Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat. A North campaign spokesman, Mark Merritt, said the money from Duke supporters was unsolicited and came as something of a surprise. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow Coalition, said the crossover suggested \"an ideological kinship\" between Mr. Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, and Mr. North. Mr. North called Mr. Jackson's assertion \"fear mongering.\"   MARYLAND -- Eighty-two percent of black voters in Maryland back the Democratic candidate for governor, Parris Glendening, preferring him 9 to 1 over his Republican opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, The Washington Post reported. The newspaper said only 9 percent of black voters polled in a random telephone survey of 808 registered voters Oct. 8-11 backed Ms. Sauerbrey, whom white voters supported 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Glendening. Mr. Glendening courted black leaders, winning the early endorsement of Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore by promising expanded state aid and a renewed effort to stimulate economic development in the city. Blacks make up one quarter of Maryland's population.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941102","headline":"Attention, Attention: Anyone There?
