It is a fine machine in many ways, but the little built-in trackball is awkward to use even when it works correctly, which it often doesn't. Microsoft Windows can be operated without a mouse or trackball, but many of its programs cannot.   While it seems that the rest of the world is switching from DOS computers to Microsoft Windows computers, with DOS in the background, I switched back. I deleted the Windows subdirectory, using the DOS Deltree command, removed references to Windows in the autoexec.bat and config.sys files, using the DOS Editor, and put the fairly lean and slightly mean Professional Write 3.0 for MS-DOS word-processing program (the SPC Software Publishing Corporation; $100 or less) on the hard disk. Then I refurbished the chips and hard disk with Memmaker, Scandisk and Defrag, all features of DOS routines.

In their overall configuration, our death penalty statutes facially satisfy the constitutional requirements of the Eighth and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The multitiered pyramid meets the prerequisite of consistency and reliability by guiding the capital sentencer's discretion with clear and objective standards that narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty and by providing a meaningful basis for distinguishing between those cases in which the death penalty is imposed and those in which it is not. The third tier in the pyramid meets the individualization prerequisite by requiring the sentencer to consider any relevant mitigating information so as to enable the sentencer to make the reasoned moral judgment that death is the appropriate punishment in a particular case.                      . . .         We must therefore decide whether contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms compel the conclusion that any death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The question is not whether any one of us would vote to enact a death penalty if our role were that of a legislator. It is, rather, whether the defendant is correct in his contention that the death penalty is so inherently cruel and so lacking in moral and sociological justification that it is unconstitutional on its face because it is fundamentally offensive to evolving standards of human decency. Stated so categorically, we are unpersuaded by the defendant's contention. Judicial evaluation of evolving standards of human decency cannot proceed in a vacuum. Community standards of acceptable legislative policy choices are necessarily reflected in the text of our constitutional document, in our history and in the teachings of our sister states as well as that of the Federal courts. While we should not blindly follow a beaten path, we agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court's cogent observation: \"When, in the course of a decade, 37 states call for the death penalty, the probability that the legislature of each state accurately reflects its community's standards approaches certainty.\" State v.

It's not that the infraction that got him a two-race ban yesterday from the world Formula One championship was so serious. The worst error committed by Schumacher -- the German driver who is now threatened with seeing the wheels come off a smooth ride to the 1994 world championship -- may be that he simply became too big too fast.   Ruling in Paris, the International Automobile Federation said Schumacher, the winner of six of eight Grand Prix races in 1994 and runner-up in the other two, had been penalized for passing the pole-sitter, Damon Hill of England, on the warm-up lap of the British Grand Prix in Silverstone, England, on July 10 and temporarily ignoring a subsequent black flag.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940727","headline":"Back Home, Brogna Is Man of the Year","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/sports/baseball-back-home-brogna-is-man-of-the-year.html","abstract":"  The patrons started filing in shortly after 6 A.M., which is when Joe Ro's coffee shop opens its doors.

Chances are he will sit quietly by his locker nibbling on a Snickers bar, let the other guys do the talking, then go out and stampede for 150 yards. So when Hampton today guaranteed that the Giants would make the playoffs, it was an unusually bold statement for someone who is so quiet.   Quiet but powerful. And it is clear that Hampton, the heart and soul of New York's running game, has quietly become one of the team's most respected players. That might explain the bold prediction. Bold because many people expect the Giants to miss the playoffs because of the loss of so many key players, such as Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, and 75 percent of the starting secondary. Hampton dismissed the doomsayers. His thoughts? The Giants will get in -- count on it. 'We Believe in Ourselves'    \"I heard people say we weren't going to make the playoffs last year,\" Hampton said. \"Then before you know, we were 3-0 and then people were saying we hadn't played anybody. Then we went to the playoffs. I think the same thing will happen this year. We'll get there. People can doubt us if they want to, but we believe in ourselves and we'll be in the playoffs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940728","headline":"Case of Bangladesh Writer Opens Old Wounds; She Endangers Women","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/opinion/l-case-of-bangladesh-writer-opens-old-wounds-she-endangers-women-792705.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your July 16 front-page article on the furor over Taslima Nasrin in Bangladesh notes her failure to attract sufficient support from her feminist and literary peers in the country.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940728","headline":"Close Race in Germany: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/opinion/IHT-close-race-in-germany-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"A News report in your June 25 issue said that opinion polls indicated that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party had \"pulled clearly\" ahead of the rival Social Democrats.

But this year, after an aggressive business lobbying campaign, the President junked his own solution and extended trade privileges unconditionally. Now it is up to Congress to try to repair the damage. It can begin by passing legislation that would re-link tariff rates for certain Chinese goods to minimum human rights standards.   The annual struggles over China's tariffs stem from the outrage many Americans felt when Deng Xiaoping ordered army tanks to mow down students demonstrating for democracy in Beijing's Tiananmen Square five years ago.

It would affect civilians and military personnel who apply for any of the more than two million Government jobs and armed-services billets that require security clearances.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940728","headline":"Backing Mayor, Board of Education Re-elects President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/nyregion/backing-mayor-board-of-education-re-elects-president.html","abstract":"  In a demonstration of the Mayor's control, Rudolph W.

But about 200 of the sect's disabled students are taught with public funds in a school that the State Legislature carved out as a special district in 1989. Hasidic families have thus been allowed to shelter their disabled children from the ridicule and hostility parents fear they would encounter in neighboring public schools because of their distinctive dress and membership in a reclusive community -- while still educating them with public funds.    How far should New York State go to accommodate this group? The U.S. Supreme Court says the state went too far by creating a special district to educate them. Now the Legislature and Gov. Mario Cuomo have approved a law that tries to get around the Court's objections. The new law faces another possible court challenge. But even if it does not violate constitutional barriers against state aid to religion, it represents bad policy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940728","headline":"Financing for Times Square Leads to Harsher Criticism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/nyregion/financing-for-times-square-leads-to-harsher-criticism.html","abstract":"  Less than a week before a critical deadline in the long-delayed plan to redevelop Times Square, a new report from one of the project's most prominent critics suggests that the deal for four huge office towers has created a financial quagmire that could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
