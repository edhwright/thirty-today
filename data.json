They are usually shadows cast on the retina by small structures in the vitreous humor, the jelly that fills the eyeball. Other changes in the vitreous humor may lead to the perception of flashing lights, or flashers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930504","headline":"Classes Improved Gays' Ties to Police","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/opinion/l-classes-improved-gays-ties-to-police-867193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Healing Wounds and Seeking Understanding\" (news article, April 19) performs a valuable service by illustrating the benefits of striving for openness and cooperation between citizens and the police.

That tale of an unexpected friendship has its touching moments, most of which are in the tender, fluttering hands of Brent Carver, the riveting Canadian actor who makes his New York debut as the window dresser, Molina. But the relationship that fascinated and finally moved me most in the show at the Broadhurst is only tangential to its plot: the love affair that Mr. Prince masterminds between Chita Rivera and the audience.   Ms. Rivera plays the title role, a B-movie queen in a Louise Brooks bob who stars in the celluloid reruns that Molina conjures to pass the time of his incarceration. This means that she gets to pop on stage every scene or two in musical parodies of 1940's movie schlock (music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb) and to wear costumes that include a scanty, yellow feathered jungle skirt and headdress, a czarina's silk gown and, most persistently, a horror picture's spider bodysuit befitting her status as the evening's symbolic angel of death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930504","headline":"Observer; A Case Of Eerie Leakage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/opinion/observer-a-case-of-eerie-leakage.html","abstract":"  Does anybody else here have leaking TV cable?

This program has more hands than a sexy Indian deity and distributes pronouncements, from First Amendment absolutism to calls for censorship, like alms. The arguments find academics cheek to cheek with flesh peddlers and religious rightists in bed with radical feminists.   Unfortunately, although many views are advanced, few are joined. The hour is a grab bag of opinions, adorned by pictures of a sort that do not usually show up on the tube until after midnight, and almost never on public stations. And it is stitched together by a machine-made narration: \"Perhaps the most controversial genre of pornography is that group of representations known as sadomasochistic. Complex in its implications, sadomasochistic imagery. . . .\" The juxtaposition of textbook lingo and randy pictures could make a \"Saturday Night Live\" routine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930505","headline":"Reno Moving to Reverse Stiff Sentencing Rule for Minor Drug Crimes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/05/us/reno-moving-to-reverse-stiff-sentencing-rule-for-minor-drug-crimes.html","abstract":"  Emboldened by support from a growing number of Federal judges, Attorney General Janet Reno has begun to take the first steps toward reversing the policy of meting out tough criminal sentences for minor drug offenses.

In much the same way, Mayakovsky's presence on Friday at Lehman College in the Bronx was more or less muffled by another Russian poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who for several hours ate up the stage with extroverted poetry readings (mostly poems by Mr. Yevtushenko), loud asides and athletic, audience-milking shtick. Through the haze of bombast, traces of Mayakovsky's striking imagination did seep into view. The poet died in 1930 and left behind some of the century's most interesting and extravagant imagery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/sports/transactions-952093.html","abstract":"  Basketball  National Basketball Association   NBA -- Fined John Starks and the New York Knicks $5,000 each for a flagrant foul Starks committed against Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers in a playoff game Tuesday night.

The subject of what Arbour referred to as \"just a standard little playoff chat\" was how to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in three easy lessons.    With their Patrick Division series knotted at one game apiece, and with the knowledge that they have already defeated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions four times this season, the Islanders were receptive to Arbour's address.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Elderly Trapped by Pride and Their Ties to the Past; State Repair Money Can Be Scarce for Dilapidated Houses of the Aged in the Catskills","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/nyregion/elderly-trapped-pride-their-ties-past-state-repair-money-can-be-scarce-for.html","abstract":"  Violet Brown, 73, first saw the old house that is her home when the road in front was only a cow path and she was just 12 years old.

Now her longtime home, 200 years old, is in serious disrepair. She treads gingerly in the bathroom, for fear of falling through the floor, and she hurt herself trying to stop the water cascading through a crack in her living room wall during a recent rainstorm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"13 Indicted In Oil Scheme Laid to Mob","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/nyregion/13-indicted-in-oil-scheme-laid-to-mob.html","abstract":"  Thirteen members of the Mafia and of Russian organized crime were indicted today on charges of collaborating in a scheme to evade $60 million in Federal and state taxes on the sale of gasoline and fuel oil, Federal officials said.   The United States Attorney for New Jersey, Michael Chertoff, called it the largest tax-evasion conspiracy of its kind, part of a larger problem nationwide that defrauds the Government of more than $2 billion a year.

Melido Perez was breezing by the California Angels, putting the fans at Yankee Stadium to sleep with consistency. Three straight strikeouts bridging the first and second innings? Maybe the fans should sneak a quick nap before the Yankees batted in the second.   Before anyone could snooze, the second inning had turned disastrous because the bottom third of the California order chipped and chopped away for three runs off Perez. A walk, a bouncing single and Gary DiSarcina's startling three-run homer, all with two outs, powered the Angels to a 6-2 victory last night.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Key Issue for U.S. and U.N.: Who Leads the Peacekeepers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-key-issue-for-us-and-un-who-leads-the-peacekeepers.html","abstract":"  Even as the Bosnian Serbs debated the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States and the United Nations were at odds today over who would control the troops enforcing it.
