To Congress mavens, who have long loved the boisterous, raucous, backslapping, logrolling politics intrinsic to the legislature, this is a startling development. We are used to malign neglect from the public and the press. Instead, for the first time in modern memory, the First Branch of the American Government is getting the attention, and the respect, that normally has gone to the Presidency.\n\nThe reasons are clear. The most significant was the stunning election in November, bringing the first Republican majority to the House of Representatives in 40 years and the return of a rarely seen Republican majority to the Senate. For the first time in nearly 50 years, we have a Democratic President facing a Republican Congress, rather than the familiar opposite combination. Add the twist of the Contract With America: a revolutionary governing platform with explicit promises for action in the opening 100 days and a blueprint for a fast-paced, efficient policy machine in Congress. Then throw in the electrifying choice of the controversial Newt Gingrich of Georgia as Speaker of the House. The result is a spectacle that has mesmerized not just Washington, but many people living outside the Beltway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Deanna Damiano, Joseph Bastianich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/style/weddings-vows-deanna-damiano-joseph-bastianich.html","abstract":"  When it comes to food, Deanna Damiano, 25, and Joseph Bastianich, 27, are opposites.

The Egyptians plastered their houses and tombs with a lime-gypsum material similar to modern plaster. The Greeks and Romans also recognized the sanitary value of lime and coated walls with it to prevent the spread of vermin and disease.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, however, the level of craftsmanship dropped. Instead of lime and gypsum, a mixture of clay and dung with horsehair as a binder was used to plaster walls. But by the end of the 13th century traditional methods and materials resurfaced, and in the 15th century the craft reached new heights as artisans used plaster not simply as a wall covering, but also for ornamental molding and sculpture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Jennifer Babcock, Ashley T.

The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis's achievements in handling those varied demands have brought him considerable success. Judging from its title, one would expect his book, SWEET SWING BLUES ON THE ROAD (Norton, $29.95), to document how he had managed this mix. At its most engaging, it does just that, offering brief vignettes of the days and nights of a touring band: the humor, the petty annoyances and the satisfaction of making music for (mostly) appreciative audiences. There is also a moving chapterlong homage to respected elder jazzmen. Frank Stewart's elegant photographs offer a nice visual counterpoint to the text. Unfortunately, at some point in his career, Mr. Marsalis took on or had thrust upon him the mantle of Spokesman for the Art of Jazz, a mantle that he now wears quite happily. As a result, too much of the book is taken up with transcripts of classroom sessions in which he restates his views on music and culture and his distaste for rap, rock and MTV. Whether or not one agrees with his assessment of popular culture, he has stated these views forcefully in other, more appropriate venues. Those who agree with Mr. Marsalis will undoubtedly be happy to have their opinions affirmed yet again, but readers looking for a more complete picture of road life will be disappointed.\nGEORGE ROBINSON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"The Controversy Over Plans To Trim the State's Budget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/the-controversy-over-plans-to-trim-the-state-s-budget.html","abstract":"  CLUTCHING their handmade suits and dresses, the old women at the Home for the Aged Blind in Yonkers were both proud and frightened -- proud that they had learned to sew again, although this time it was without their eyes, but worried that they would soon be shut out of the day-care program that taught them their new skills.

The exemption was based on the premise, dubious enough in 1922, that baseball was not interstate commerce. Today, of course, almost no one believes that Major League Baseball still qualifies for such an exemption. No other sport, no other entertainment, indeed no other industry anywhere near the scale of baseball, is exempt from antitrust laws.    The baseball owners themselves have not believed it when it was in their interest. In 1966 the owners invoked the Taft-Hartley Act, which prohibited the payment of money by an employer to an employee's organization, to renege on a $150,000 payment to the fledgling Players Association. The union's executive director, Marvin Miller, was delighted because by citing the law the owners admitted to engaging in interstate commerce.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Upper-Upper West: Above 100th Street","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/good-eating-upper-upper-west-above-100th-street.html","abstract":"  BLUE COLLAR CAFE ++ (212) 864-9212; 940 Amsterdam Avenue, at 106th Street; $; no credit cards","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"New Job, Controversy Find Howe Once Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/sports/baseball-new-job-controversy-find-howe-once-again.html","abstract":"  Steve Howe became the first striking major league player to enter a replacement spring training camp this morning when he exited from a white minivan to a maze of reporters, almost tripped over a garbage can and disappeared into the Yankees offices.

In recent months, House Speaker Newt Gingrich has attacked the Government agency for supplying \"patronage for an elite group.\" The N.E.A. has responded by citing evidence of the spiritual, social and economic benefits of the arts for all Americans.   Both the attack and the defense are misguided. Populist conservative critics, in accusing the endowment of \"elitism,\" are echoing a criticism the agency addressed long ago. In 1991, for example, endowment literature pointedly portrayed the agency as nonelitist, boasting that it served 170 ethnic minorities and insured a broad distribution of benefits, taking into account race, ethnicity, sex and geography. Unfortunately, those criteria have little to do with artistic judgment and much to do with social policy. When it comes to art, there is no way of judging even vastly divergent styles without some notion of differentiation and choice -- in other words, elitism. If the N.E.A. is doing its job properly, Mr. Gingrich should be praising it, not condemning it, for being elitist.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"'Resounding Success'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/arts/l-harvey-milk-resounding-success-474795.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Edward Rothstein is entitled to his opinion of our opera \"Harvey Milk\"  [ \"Heroes Make Good Opera; Icons Don't,\" Feb. 12 ] , but we reject his dismissal of its favorable international critical reception.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Reading Between the Emotional Lines","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/making-it-work-reading-between-the-emotional-lines.html","abstract":"  THE man in the mismatched clothes and greasy hair stared into space while explaining to the judge, in an eerie monotone, why he should be released from the mental hospital.

That's when I tell my friends that I have some work to do on the museums and churches of Nauplia and Monemvasia, and head out of town for a few days to take in a little culture and a lot of cuisine.\n\n It may seem odd to link Nauplia (population 10,000), the energetic Peloponnesian harbor town on the east shore of the Gulf of Argos, with Monemvasia, the sleepy island fortress with a year-round population of perhaps 10 perched just off the southeastern prong of the Peloponnesus. Yet the two have geography, history and determination in common: each is built on the slopes of a rocky promontory; for centuries, each was a strategic defense citadel, and recently, each has attracted visitors to a well-preserved past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Votes in Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/votes-in-congress-355595.html","abstract":"  Tally Last Week in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York  House   1.

One, famously, was Carthage. The other was Corinth, leader of the league of Greek cities that had tried to resist Roman imperial expansion. Under the command of the consul Lucius Mummius, the Romans destroyed Corinth's buildings, killed the men, sold the women and children into slavery, and shipped its art treasures back to Italy. For about a hundred years Corinth lay broken and abandoned.   Finally, in 44 B.C., no longer willing to let the site's strategic position go to waste, the Romans founded a colony there. Although the proletarian colonists did not much appreciate the former greatness of their new home (they did grasp the value of the works of art they scavenged among the ruins and shipped back home), by that time more sensitive Romans were well aware of the barbarity of Mummius's act. One historian, writing in the early first century A.D., offers as proof of the man's boorishness his warning to the transporters of paintings and statues by the greatest artists of the Greek world that they would have to replace anything they broke.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Why Law Is No Fun Anymore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/books/why-law-is-no-fun-anymore.html","abstract":"  OVERCOMING LAW By Richard A.

But the picture looks considerably darker from the perspective of the ill-prepared communities next to the bases, where the closings could prove devastating. That is especially true of Long Beach, the big port at the southern end of Los Angeles County, which is suffering from a deep post-cold-war hangover.

It was no accident that Tolstoy wrote the opening of \"War and Peace\" in French. After spending a day talking to delegates at the United Nations, I've been thinking that this old romance between Russia and France might have some modern-day applications.    American officials have been grumbling lately about a budding Russo-French alliance. Russia and France have teamed up against the U.S. to push for an early lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq. They have also worked in tandem at times to ease the isolation of Serbia. The Russians have even probed about joining NATO on the same terms as France -- being part of the alliance but not part of its military command. And the Russians have clearly taken to the French national sport of poking a stick in Washington's eye to assert independence.I don't believe there is any real Russo-French strategic alliance; it's more a coincidence of pragmatism. But I do share the view, first articulated by Sovietologist Stephen Sestanovich, that the future of Russian foreign policy is \"Gaullist\" -- that somewhere in the psyche of the Kremlin is a desire to create the sort of relationship with the U.S. that France enjoys. That is, to be seen as broadly part of the Western camp, but still free to define Russia's interests on a range of issues as different from America's -- without creating a crisis in the relationship every time it does.    I think this Russian impulse should be nurtured. The problem with U.S. policy toward Russia today is that in order to persuade Congress to give aid to Moscow, Presidents Bush and Clinton oversold the relationship. Our aid to Russia, they declared, was intended to make Russia just like us.    When Russia does not behave like us, there are two responses. The \"I-love-the-cold-war\" crowd immediately calls for severing aid. Just last week, Newt Gingrich declared that \"we should cut off all aid to Russia\" if it sells nuclear reactors to Iran.    The Clinton Administration responds with the other extreme -- apologizing for Boris Yeltsin, saying in effect: \"Don't pay attention to that man behind the curtain. He's not really drunk. Chechnya was just an aberration, a speed bump on the road to democracy and blah, blah, blah.\" All of which only signals to the Russians that there is little cost to misbehavior.    In other words, right now we have a conceptual approach toward Russia that does not fit the reality of Russia. We keep checking to see if the Russians have become like us, and when we discover they haven't we want to either punish them in ways that only hurt reformers there, or turn a blind eye. It is time we started thinking of Russia as being more like France and less like us -- but only if the Russians are ready to do the same.    You see, the French may disagree with us on issues. They might even kick our spies out of Paris. But it is virtually unimaginable that France would ever take a position that threatened fundamental U.S. national security interests. It is unlikely that Russia today would take such a threatening position -- but not unimaginable.    The reason for that difference is that France is an established democracy and an established state. It knows exactly who it is and where its borders are. The modern Russian state is basically three years old. It is not an established democracy, and it is not certain about its borders or who its citizens are. Russia today is America in 1779. That is 10 years before we agreed on a constitution and 82 years before we had our own civil war.    It would actually be healthy for us to think of Russia the way we think of France. That is, drawing red lines to define fundamental U.S. interests (and I think banning nuclear reactors for Iran is one of those), while learning to raise our eyebrows in other cases and say of the Russians what we say of the French: \"What else do you expect? It's the French.\"    We have to understand the difference between a pain in the neck and a mortal threat. But we will only be able to treat Russia like France after the Russians learn to respect red lines the way the French do. Russia can only be France in our eyes after Russia decides who Russia is.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Russia, Iran and the Bomb","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/opinion/russia-iran-and-the-bomb.html","abstract":"  The United States, Russia and Iran are tangled in a nuclear thicket that threatens to impede disarming by Moscow while helping Teheran develop atomic weapons. That would qualify as a first-class failure in post-cold-war diplomacy and arms control. President Clinton, President Boris Yeltsin and members of Congress, all contributing to the problem, need to rethink their strategies.     Russia, desperate for hard currency and trying to keep its nuclear industry alive, wants to sell four nuclear reactors to Iran, which could use them to generate plutonium for bombs. The Clinton Administration is trying diplomatically to get Moscow to cancel the deal outright. Not satisfied with the Administration approach, some in Congress are eager to retaliate by cutting all aid to Russia, including help to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"An Inaugural Ride Can Have Its Bumps","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/style/the-night-an-inaugural-ride-can-have-its-bumps.html","abstract":"  The New York Skyride, on the mezzanine of the Empire State Building, isn't a chairlift to the World Trade towers or a monorail to the theme-park restaurants on 57th Street.

In the kingdom of 20th-century composition, it has achieved old-master status, and that is how the Arditti Quartet presented it at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night. If the first half of this interesting if elusive program seemed exploratory, Berg's six movements after intermission represented a culture at rest: relaxed and confident in both its message and language.   The \"Lyric Suite\" has dark moments (the ending is marked \"Largo desolato\"), yet it is perhaps the happiest piece of music ever to come out of the Second Viennese School. The blanket description, \"Lyric,\" is accurate; the music literally spills over with a hopeful effusiveness. Berg's passionate heart is never headlong and rarely wild. Immense technique and taste have grounded his emotions, set them in graspable limits that can be admired as well as loved. The Arditti played this music beautifully.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950227","headline":"Sports of The Times; West Outlasts a Legend and Outsmarts a League","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-west-outlasts-a-legend-and-outsmarts-a-league.html","abstract":"  THE Friday night attendance was 17,505, a sellout, the signal that Jerry West was waiting for.

Bit by bit since the disastrous midterm elections, the President has begun assembling a team -- some old, some new, some borrowed and none, he hopes, blue -- to help him through the complex and potentially contradictory challenge at hand: how to shore up his base among traditional Democratic liberals while wooing back the moderates who helped elect him in the first place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950227","headline":"As Balanced-Budget Vote Looms, Several Senators String Out the Suspense","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/27/us/as-balanced-budget-vote-looms-several-senators-string-out-the-suspense.html","abstract":"  Senators get to be senators because they are good politicians, and so it is not unheard of for one of them to withhold some pronouncement on an issue until the last moment, seeking to increase influence or hog the spotlight.

The vote is on the adoption of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, almost certainly the most important vote of the year.

Yes and no. On Sunday night here at the Pensacola Civic Center, the band leaders were Led Zeppelin's main songwriters, the guitarist Jimmy Page and the singer Robert Plant, and most of their set was songs they wrote for Led Zeppelin. But they were out to rethink the music that made Led Zeppelin one of rock's most influential bands.   Led Zeppelin officially disbanded when its drummer, John Bonham, died in 1980. Since then, the surviving members have steadfastly refused the lucrative temptation to tour as Led Zeppelin, though they used the name again for one-time appearances at Live Aid in 1985 and at Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary concert in 1988. But its presence lingers. Led Zeppelin's old songs remain staples on rock radio stations, and its music has been the blueprint for numberless hard-rock bands. When this Page-Plant tour was announced, the shows quickly sold out, including the New York City area stop on April 6 at Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.

I would dare to guess that other aspects of Friday's performance were brighter and fresher than they were in the 1969 original. Have the Met orchestra and its conductor James Levine, for example, ever made more elegantly sensuous music than this? Strauss's score scarcely conceals the carnal luxury and self-indulgent tenderness beneath its thin layers of decorum.
