These officials said they were told to prepare the report for release next Friday, even though they insisted that it could be ready sooner.

His specialty, both wrenching and uplifting, is the music of Jewish Czech composers who died in Nazi concentration camps, and particularly those who spent time at Theresienstadt, near Prague, the collection point for about 140,000 Jews, most of whom were later deported to other camps. The Nazis called Theresienstadt a \"Paradise Ghetto,\" and used it in a 1944 propaganda film, \"The Fuhrer Presents the Jews With a City,\" which was meant to show that the inmates enjoyed a lively cultural life.    As director of the Terezin Chamber Music Foundation, Mr. Ludwig has been interviewing aging musicians and searching for scores that were either hidden away or entrusted to friends. He has found orchestral works, which the Boston Symphony has performed in Boston and New York, and a great deal of chamber music -- some written at Theresienstadt, some before the war -- which he performs with three Boston Symphony colleagues as a member of the Hawthorne String Quartet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930417","headline":"Bicycle Built for $10,000","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/17/nyregion/bicycle-built-for-10000.html","abstract":"  While farmers in this quiet community in the foothills of the Berkshires prepare their fields for spring planting, one man in a rambling red building is readying his own crop: more than 200 bicycles, some from as long ago as 1820.

You refer to only half the world's people -- females. Of course, every female must have access to birth control, but how can she be in charge of her body if she is not in control of her life? When 98 percent of the world's growth is taking place in third world countries (and unknown percentages in our inner cities), ignorant, exhausted, often abused females cannot possibly be expected to carry this burden alone.   We're told that in China a mother must have an abortion if she has more than one child. Who knows how many abortions that could represent over a lifetime. Why isn't the male ordered to have a vasectomy after he fathers a child? Vasectomies are certainly easier and cheaper.

In fact, the Baltimore Symphony gave a fine performance of Mahler's Fourth Symphony on Tuesday evening under its music director, David Zinman. Mr. Zinman showed decided ideas about the music, and some good ones, and the players seemed eager and mostly able to carry them out.   But, for example, when Mr. Zinman coaxed those arching portamentos out of his strings, the texture tended to fray, with instruments swooping individually.

The line has a modal, medieval feeling. It doesn't go anywhere or resolve anything; it seems to float in melodic space. When parts of the melody are heard later, they carry none of the dramatic weight that much of Western music associates with returning themes. Mr. Tavener, like his Eastern European colleagues Arvo Part and Henryk Gorecki, is after something quite different: an experience of timelessness and devotion rather than contrast and evolution.   \"The Protecting Veil,\" which was given its New York premiere recently by the cellist Steven Isserlis and the New England Conservatory Orchestra conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, is unevenly successful in creating that experience. But its iconlike simplicity, along with its programmatic evocation of the life of the Virgin Mary, has helped make this piece an enormous success in a recording on (yes) the Virgin label. Mr. Tavener's works, like those of his Eastern European counterparts, try to strip away Western music's accouterments of harmony and development, aiming for a premodern spirituality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"When the Twain of Science and God Meet; Einstein's Faith","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/opinion/l-when-the-twain-of-science-and-god-meet-einstein-s-faith-576093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"In Science We Trust\" (Op-Ed, April 8) by Bryan Appleyard, which addresses the relationship of physics to God, makes reference to Albert Einstein in support of its thesis, even calling him \"the godfather of this rhetoric.\" Mr. Appleyard states that \"God, for Einstein, had a certain reality, a moral force.\" These views represent common, serious misconceptions about Einstein's religiosity or lack of it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Playoff Atmosphere Feels Right To Islanders","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/sports/hockey-playoff-atmosphere-feels-right-to-islanders.html","abstract":"  Last season, Vladimir Malakhov represented the former Soviet Union in the Olympic Games and in the world championship tournament.

Big Apple believes it is making demolition history by taking down so large a piece of newly built space that is both structurally sound and economically viable. It is happening at a time when demolition for its more accustomed purpose -- site clearance in preparation for something new -- is at a low ebb.

WHAT ARE THEY Pheromones are chemicals that carry signals that drive the libido to do the lambada, among other things. Animals like pigs and deer and bees and silkworms also use pheromones to stake out territory and send warnings to other members of their species. A male pig, for example, spits in the face of his favorite fertile sow and -- presto! -- she temporarily becomes a nymphomaniac. WHY? The search for human pheromones that, like those of their animal counterparts, would enhance sexuality and excite Eros has long been an obsession of the $4.8 billion fragrance business. Fragrance companies, struggling to heat up stagnant sales with something truly new, have spent millions, if not billions, trying to isolate human pheromones.   If the Erox (echoism intended?) Corporation, a new company in Menlo Park, Calif., has indeed identified human pheromones -- and scientists and fragrance experts are dubious -- and can obtain patents on their synthetic versions, it has stumbled onto a financial mother lode that could take the perfume business into a whole new realm. WHY ELSE? Until a few years ago, scientists took as gospel a 1938 study by an eminent neuroanatomist who contended that humans lacked the proper apparatus, a vomeronasal organ, with which to sense pheromones. And anyway, if we did have one, it was vestigial.   Human pheromones do not have smells, scientists advising Erox say. So unless we had a working vomeronasal organ, we couldn't detect human pheromones, even if they did exist.   But Dr. Larry J. Stensaas, a professor of neuroanatomy and physiologist at the University of Utah who advises Erox, said he had discovered a human vomeronasal organ, which he nicknamed \"the VNO,\" along the septum. Dr. Luis Monti-Bloch, another professor at Utah, has devised a gadget to test whether it works. They say initial studies show it does. WILL HUMAN PHEROMONES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS PIG SPIT? No. Although popular myth and Madison Avenue have suggested that pheromones behave as aphrodisiacs to stimulate the opposite sex, the Erox fragrances are not formulated to attract hordes of libidinous construction workers, for example, to a female wearer. The pheromone compound in the male fragrance was deliberately selected to have the greatest impact on a male wearer, while the female fragrance is steeped with one appealing most to a woman.   Such a state of affairs would seem to defeat the purpose of Erox's grand marketing strategy, which is aimed at heterosexuals, not gays.   In fact, neither fragrance claims to be a sexual magnet for members of either sex. Instead, people who have used the fragrance say it has enhanced their self-confidence and sense of well-being, which, the folks at Erox suggests, may make the wearer more attractive.    \"A sense of confident ease, being more comfortable, may increase sensuality,\" said Pierre de Champfleury, Erox's president and chief executive. \"By feeling more confident, the wearer might feel more free to approach someone he or she might otherwise not approach.\" SOCIAL STUDIES: Remember Musk by Jovan? Perfumers have been using pheromones like musk from deer and castoreum from beavers to concoct fragrances since the pyramids were blueprints. The chemicals act as preservatives and, in some cases, contribute to a scent.   But while advertising often suggests that animal pheromones (or the synthesized equivalents used in modern perfumes) will cast the same spell over humans as they do over animals, pheromones work only on members of the same species. The synthesized pheromones in the new fragrances are clones of extractions from human skin, so they supposedly have an effect on humans. SMELLS FISHY? The experts aren't convinced, either. Their reactions to the notion of human pheromones range from snorts of disbelief to credulity couched in careful language.    \"I've always been extremely skeptical until the last few years,\" said Dr. Gary K. Beauchamp, director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, a leading research institute that studies smell and taste. \"But there have now been a number of investigations suggesting that people do have a vomeronasal organ.   \"Whether it's functional or not is another question.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Perspectives: Use-Based Billing; New Buoys on the Water-Meter Course","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/realestate/perspectives-use-based-billing-new-buoys-on-the-water-meter-course.html","abstract":"  BEWARE the \"extraordinary leak.\" John Alexiou apparently had one in the building he owns at 31-21 23d Avenue in Astoria, Queens, where he runs an insurance business and rents out two apartments upstairs.

Despite the triumph of that tie, the Devils have allowed 19 goals in their last three games and played poorly in the 8-4 loss to the Islanders Friday night that earned them the playoff ticket to Pittsburgh instead of Landover, Md..","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Anarchy and Plain Bad Luck","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/anarchy-and-plain-bad-luck.html","abstract":"  RED SORGHUM   A Novel of China.

Dawn and Basehead, both of whom have just released their second albums, and of performers like Arrested Development, Me Phi Me, Divine Styler and Papa's Culture, the borders of hip-hop have grown fuzzy. Now there's not only hip-hop that speaks to urban teen-agers but hip-hop for students and suburban slackers, for dreamers and for lovers.   The music is no longer just the public sound of street parties and booming car stereos; it can also be the private, playful, sometimes trippy results of musicians toying with instruments and samples and words. Instead of the stark rhymes and basic funk of old-school rap, some hip-hop embraces melody, digressions and introspection. Without speculating on the musicians' drug predilections -- though Michael Ivey regularly mentions smoking joints on Basehead's \"Not in Kansas Anymore\" (Imago 72787 21016; cassette and CD) -- the music might be called psychedelic hip-hop.

After entertaining 11 Presidents, and shaping the tastes of a young James Beard, the Portland Hotel was unceremoniously razed in 1951. The site was paved over as a parking lot.

Yet with only 160,000 inhabitants, Burgos has the atmosphere of a small town, and most attractions are within or in walking distance of its beautifully restored old quarter, leaving plenty of time to enjoy the fine Spanish art of \"doing nothing,\" as the 19th-century English writer Richard Ford once observed. Watching the people parade on the Espolon, reading a book in an outdoor cafe, ferreting out little shops and tapas bars in the back streets, stopping along one of the bridges to watch trout fishermen and admiring the dramatic lighting of the monuments on nightly strolls to the city's relaxed restaurants are perfect counterpoints to the historical riches of Burgos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Thinner Than Thou","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/thinner-than-thou.html","abstract":"THE HUNGER ARTISTS\n\nStarving, Writing, and Imprisonment.\nBy Maud Ellmann.\nIllustrated. 136 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:\nHarvard University Press. $19.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Setting Out on a Toot Through Tuscany","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/travel/setting-out-on-a-toot-through-tuscany.html","abstract":"AT the end of a 10-hour bus ride that had begun before dawn in Tuscany, 50 musicians stumbled into the sharp Swiss sunlight and were shepherded into a frigid church, SS.

Yet, as this first volume of Brian Boyd's biography shows, neither turmoil nor subsequent poverty impeded his writing. \"Nabokov's life reads like a work by a very imaginative creator,\" Sergei Davydov said here in 1990. \"Mr. Boyd gives us that life and ventures many shrewd glimpses beyond it. As a biography his book can hardly be surpassed.\" Princeton University has also reissued Mr. Boyd's second volume, VLADIMIR NABOKOV: The American Years ($16.95), an exploration of the two decades Nabokov spent in the United States. In 1991 our reviewer, Walter Kendrick, said: \"It testifies to Mr. Boyd's skill -- and to his encyclopedic knowledge of his subject -- that he not only weaves his two Nabokovs seamlessly together but also manages to make even a teacher's life fascinating.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"In the Region: Putnam County; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/realestate/in-the-region-putnam-county-recent-sales.html","abstract":"  Port Chester, N.Y.  $205,000   66 Shelley Avenue  3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath, 58-year-old Tudor; dining room, fireplace, sun roomn, stone terrace, 1-car garage; taxes, $3,265.

They range from the essentially frontal and symmetrical \"Afro Phoenix No. 2\" (1964) to the exercise in loose and loopy forms that is \"Dry Days\" (1992).

In flimsy machines built of cloth, wood and wire, the new knights of the air engaged in one-on-one combat during World War I in which skill and luck combined to create a different form of chivalry. LEGEND, MEMORY AND THE GREAT WAR IN THE AIR (Smithsonian Institution/University of Washington, cloth, $34.95; paper, $18.95) both debunks and enriches the myths that developed almost immediately around military aviation. The authors -- Dominick A. Pisano, a curator in aeronautics at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, and Thomas J. Dietz, Joanne M. Gernstein and Karl S. Schneide, all curatorial assistants at the museum -- describe how military commanders developed the strategies that remain part of the doctrine of air warfare to this day, how they learned through trial and error what was effective, and how aviators lost their lives as the subjects of these experiments. The book also details how myths about aerial combat were formulated in contemporary propaganda, posters for movies made a half-generation after the war, and the misty-eyed memoirs of aces. \"Legend, Memory and the Great War in the Air\" is a concise synopsis of the origin of a modern form of combat and its impact on our culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Electoral Reform Is the Focus of Italian Referendums","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/world/electoral-reform-is-the-focus-of-italian-referendums.html","abstract":"  Italians vote in a series of referendums on Sunday and Monday that ostensibly chart the nation's future but also provide a chance to pass a verdict on its past.   The eight proposals -- the most important of which would begin changing the entire electoral system -- offer the country's 47.5 million voters their first occasion to judge the way they are led since a year of ever-widening scandal has shown many of their leaders to be implicated in corruption even beyond cynical expectation and has linked some of them to the Mafia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"This Proposal Is for Status Quo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/style/the-sexes-this-proposal-is-for-status-quo.html","abstract":"  POPULAR entertainments being what they are, attempts to analyze a movie these days may produce the uneasy sense that you are critiquing a cartoon. Still, Hollywood cartoons can impinge on a nerve, activating reservoirs of shame and secret longing, tapping into inadmissible impulses, in the process providing a release for moral and sexual anxiety in much the way that horror movies are said to release other types of tension. Consider \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Basic Instinct\" and, with an opening-week gross of $25 million, the current leading box-office attraction, \"Indecent Proposal,\" a film that begins in the soft focus of a Kotex ad, and goes on to prove that nothing is sacred.   The picture's evocative title instantly telegraphs the link it draws between sex and money, the two issues that even the most sanguine individuals are least sanguine about. This combination is examined through a premise that is as bogus as it is intriguing: can a middle-class marriage survive after a devoted wife sells herself for an evening to a stunning-but-lonely billionaire winsomely played by a guarded-yet-tender Robert Redford? Or, to recycle the question Erich Segal posited more than 25 years ago, does being in love really mean never having to say you're sorry?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"A Reasoned Verdict in Los Angeles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/opinion/a-reasoned-verdict-in-los-angeles.html","abstract":"  The two Los Angeles police officers convicted in the Rodney King beating committed national crimes.

They violated a citizen's Federal right to receive justice in a court of law, not the on-the-scene, summary punishment shown in a shocking amateur videotape.    A city and nation that were alarmed over the beating and torn by riots after last year's state trial are entitled to a new national, collective sense of relief that due process has prevailed. The verdicts are a jury's eloquent answer to a distressed people whose former President, George Bush, rightly dispatched Federal prosecutors to safeguard the national interest.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"CHILDREN'S BOOKS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/childrens-books.html","abstract":"ISHI'S TALE OF LIZARD\n\nBy Leanne Hinton.\nIllustrated by Susan L.

The large bandwidth and low noise of the fiberoptic cable used by both phone and cable companies should make them natural competitors and do more to serve the public than any amount of regulations by public -- read political -- service commissions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"The Dude Is Back in Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/style/the-dude-is-back-in-town.html","abstract":"TOM BROKAW couldn't be at the opening of Big Sky Western Furniture because he was in Big Timber, his ranch in Montana.

Shcherbo, who won six gold medals at the Barcelona Olympics, added the vault and parallel bars titles to the all-around championship he had won Thursday.  Miller, a 16-year-old high school student from Edmond, Okla, floundered on the beam, one of her strongest events, and finished last. But the American won a gold in the floor exercises to add to the all-round and uneven bars titles she had already won. The American women's team wound up with three golds, all won by Miller, and two silver medals won by Dominique Dawes. (AP) TENNIS  Sampras Is King Kong of Hong Kong  Pete Sampras, the world's top-ranked player, won a showdown with second-ranked Jim Courier yesterday, beating the former No. 1 player, 6-3, 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-2), to win the Salem Open in Hong Kong. Sampras, who took over Courier's top ranking last week when he won the Japan Open, won the first set with a service break in the sixth game. Courier squandered two break points in the sixth game of the second set. Both Americans held their serves, with Courier winning the tie breaker, 7-1. Courier saved a match point in the 12th game of the third set to force another tie breaker, but this time it was the 21-year-old Sampras who won it with ease. Sampras hit 15 aces in the final, which lasted nearly three hours. He now has a 7-2 record in matches against Courier.  (AP) A Title for Goellner: Marc Goellner of Germany won his first career title by coming from behind to beat Ivan Lendl, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, in the final of the Nice Open in France. It was the first final on the ATP Tour for the 6-foot-6-inch Goellner, ranked 95th in the world. He had never gotten past the quarterfinals of a pro event before Nice. It was the 143d career final for Lendl, who has won 92 titles.  Goellner had to win three qualifying matches to get into the main draw. He reached the final with a victory over top-seeded Stefan Edberg. Yesterday, Lendl broke Goellner's serve three times in the first set. But after that, Goellner did not lose another serve. In the second set, the 23-year-old Goellner broke Lendl, 33, in the fifth game to take a 3-2 lead and hold it for the rest of the set to even the match. (AP) MARATHON  Martin Is the Man of the Hours  Eamonn Martin of Britain, running in his first marathon, broke free in a dramatic sprint over the last 100 yards to beat Isidro Rico of Mexico and win the London Marathon yesterday. The women's race also went down to the wire with defending champion Katrin Dorre of Germany sprinting away from Lisa Ondieki of Australia over the last 1,000 yards for the victory. The 34-year-old Martin ran shoulder-to-shoulder with Rico over the last four miles before showing the kick that had made him a Commonwealth champion. The winning time was 2 hours 10 minutes 50 seconds. Rico clocked 2:10.53 for second, while Gajdus Grzegorz of Poland was third in 2:11.07. Dorre finished in 2:27.09. Ondieki clocked 2:27.27 and the Briton Liz McColgan 2:29.37. (AP) SOCCER  Team Needs to Practice Celebrating  Steve Morrow scored the winning goal yesterday as Arsenal defeated Sheffield Wednesday, 2-1, to win England's League Cup. But victory had a price, as Morrow ended up being carried from the field with an injury that was sustained when he was tossed in the air in celebration. Morrow's winning goal came in the 68th minute and was his first for Arsenal. But when his teammates tossed him into the air after the game, they failed to catch him. And as they accepted the trophy, Morrow was carried off the field on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face. It was later determined that he had broken an arm. Sheffield Wednesday went ahead, 1-0, on a goal by the American John Harkes in the ninth minute. But Arsenal got the equalizer in the 18th minute when Paul Merson volleyed home a curling 25-yard shot. Harkes, of Kearny, N.J., became the first American to score a goal in a Wembley Stadium final. Two years ago, he became the first American to play in a Wembley final. The two teams will meet again in the final of the more prestigious FA Cup final at Wembley on May 15. (AP) Canada Stays Unbeaten: Canada, behind John Catliff's two second-half goals, beat Honduras, 3-1, yesterday to remain in first place in its qualifying group for the 1994 World Cup. The victory, before a sellout crowd of 6,868 at Swangard Stadium, gave Canada a 2-0-1 record and 5 points in the group representing North and Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico (2-1-0) has 4 points and will play Canada next Sunday in Mexico City. Mexico defeated El Salvador, 3-1, yesterday before a capacity crowd of 120,000 in Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.

Huge boulders act like mounds of Styrofoam, being tilted and lowered on all-too-visible ropes.   But then, a moment later, the Met's production redeems itself, taking on another character. The giant castle gradually sinks until it seems to become part of an underwater world; rocks rise with the Rhinemaidens playfully grasping the magic Ring that has finally been tossed to them. As the music swirls, that rock too lowers, the lighting shifts slightly and in the rear Valhalla can be discerned, engulfed in flames. It is an intelligent and compact solution to Wagner's attempts to show all three regions of his universe in the score's final pages.  The performance of the Met's first \"Ring\" cycle this season, which ended on Saturday afternoon after three previous Saturday matinees, seemed to combine that final scene's mixture of clunky artifice and supple grandeur throughout its 17 hours. Much of the grandeur was heard in James Levine's conducting, which could, at its best moments, be both subtle and sweeping, aware of the score's ambiguous shifts in expression as well as its more blunt invocation of motifs. But there was much else to take pleasure in as well, and there will be two other opportunities to do so: this Otto Schenk production of the \"Ring\" will begin again tonight with \"Das Rheingold,\" with all four works to be seen within the week, as Wagner originally wished; they will repeat again next week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930419","headline":"With an Accent, All-Star Repertory Theater","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/19/arts/with-an-accent-all-star-repertory-theater.html","abstract":"  Often neglected, or at least not fully appreciated, is the role of television as the equivalent of an all-star repertory theater.
