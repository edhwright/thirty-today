One of the judges, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, declared that the book was unreadably bad and said that the awarding of the prize, Britain's most important, was a \"disgrace.\" Simon Jenkins, a conservative columnist for The Times of London, called the award \"literary vandalism.\" Several other critics sniped that the book should have been disqualified because of its heavy use of profanity.   Meanwhile, the British literary establishment huddled together defensively as Mr. Kelman appeared in a business suit at the black-tie Booker affair and, in his heavy Scottish accent, made a rousing case for the culture and language of \"indigenous\" people outside of London. \"A fine line can exist between elitism and racism,\" he said. \"On matters concerning language and culture, the distinction can sometimes cease to exist altogether.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941129","headline":"Parole for a Terrorist : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/opinion/IHT-parole-for-a-terrorist-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"In response to \"Red Army Is Now History, So Germany Orders a Parole,\" (Nov. 18):.She has shown no remorse for her part in a 1972 attack on a U.S. base, but Irmgard MÃ¶ller is to be freed nevertheless.

On the first half, Liszt's arrangement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony; on the second half, music by the Viennese-born American composer Robert Starer. The pianist's exuberance and confident attack on the keyboard tied his unusual program together.   Mr. Starer celebrates his 70th birthday this year. When the history books are written, he will probably land somewhere in the great open middle of American compositional tradition. His language is sometimes dissonant and even 12-tone in orientation, but it is fundamentally consonant beneath the surface, and his liking for open intervals puts him a shade close to Copland than, say, to Elliott Carter. Among other qualities, he has a certifiable gift for melody. Mr. Kolb gave the world premiere of his Sonata No. 3, an unpretentious but possibly overlong work in three movements.

His voice is a deep baritone, full of portentous Jim Morrison mannerisms, and his songs take up Satanism, death, sadomasochism and nearly everything else he could glean from old Black Sabbath records. \"I am a walking screaming hell/A thing of torture to behold\" he vowed as his band, Danzig, started its set on Monday night at a sold-out Roseland. Actually, he was a stocky, long-haired 35-year-old man with Elvis Presley sideburns, black jeans, cowboy boots and a rubber top that might have come from a wet suit, doing his best to glower as seriously as his songs required.   Mr. Danzig first made his reputation in the 1970's leading the Misfits, a punk band with a horror-movie fixation. Danzig is actually more old-fashioned; it draws on the blues-rock and heavy metal that punk-rock wanted to shake up. The four-man band -- with John Christ on guitar, Eerie Von on bass and Joey Castillo on drums -- is breathtakingly predictable. Every riff pounds its appointed number of times, every guitar solo delivers the appropriate squiggles. The band knows its dynamics, inflating Mr. Danzig's pronouncements with measured crescendos; its best gimmick, used sparingly, was to switch suddenly into double-time, which threw the mosh pit into a joyous frenzy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR : Piety and Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-piety-and-politics.html","abstract":"In response to the report \"School Prayer Issue: Conservatives Wary\" (Nov. 21) by Catherine S.

The Serbs' war on Bosnia has exposed deep divisions among the Western powers over NATO's role and the question of European security. Some U.S. policy makers believe that the way to revive NATO is to enlarge it by offering membership and the military guarantees that membership confers to a few countries in Eastern Europe. Their rallying cry is \"Expand or die.\"   That is a questionable idea. If Washington continues to move in this direction, it is sure to generate more trans-Atlantic divisiveness. It will burden NATO's existing members with risky new obligations. Moreover, inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join will affront those who are likely to be left out, like Ukraine and the Baltic republics. Worse yet, expansion could strengthen Russian nationalists opposed to Boris Yeltsin and his Western-oriented reformers.

Some of his friends could endure years between visits with their families, but Nagi Al Qotaini would brood and could not go that long. Sometimes, he would last only four or five months. He had been doing this for nearly 12 years, since he was 18, but it never got any easier.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941201","headline":"RESEARCHERS LINK OBESITY IN HUMANS TO FLAW IN A GENE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/01/us/researchers-link-obesity-in-humans-to-flaw-in-a-gene.html","abstract":"  Lending mighty support to the theory that obese people are not made but, rather, born that way, scientists have discovered a genetic mutation that is thought to be responsible for at least some types of obesity.   The mutation is believed to disrupt the body's energy metabolism and appetite control center, the mechanism that tells the brain one has eaten enough and has sufficient fat stores to meet the demands of the day. Without a working hormonal signal for fullness, or satiety, a person might continue to overeat even when extreme corpulence threatens health and ego.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941201","headline":"Research on Embryos Opens a Pandora's Box","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/01/opinion/l-research-on-embryos-opens-a-pandora-s-box-980129.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Should We Make Research Embryos?
