But Mr. McDowell's is a face you don't quickly forget, even if you may not quickly place it. It has to do with the intensity of his blue eyes and a certain inextinguishable rakishness. It was the face of the rebellious schoolboy Mick Travis in \"If . . . . ,\" Lindsay Anderson's 1969 parable about a revolution at a British boarding school, that in its time was the film of the moment.

Now Mr. Mitchell, one of the few black dancers to reach stardom in American ballet, is returning to the State Theater as the director of an internationally celebrated troupe, renowned for the freshness, integrity and exuberance of its classical dancing -- and for the fact that most of its 49 dancers are black.

I understand that European Gypsies meet in the Camargue in May for two days. Can you supply details? -- Angelo J. Brenna, New York N.Y.     A.  The Gypsy Pilgrimage takes place each May 24 and 25 at Stes.-Maries-de-la-Mer, about 14 miles south of Arles. Provencal legend says the place, in the marshlands of the Camargue, was where St. Marie Jacobe and St. Marie Salome and their servant, St. Sarah, among others, arrived safely on shore after being abandoned in a boat off Palestine. The three saints remained in the Camargue and were buried there. A church was built at their tomb in the ninth century, and the building was replaced in the 12th century. Gypsies (who call themselves Romany) consider Sarah their patron saint, and thousands of them, many of whom still live in caravans in their traditional nomadic life, arrive at the town each year. The pilgrimage events begin May 24 with a mass at 10 A.M. at the church. At 3 P.M. is the descente des chasses, in which the bones of the three saints are lowered by rope and pulley from an upper chapel to an altar in the chancel. At 4 P.M. there is the St. Sarah procession, in which a painted wood figure of the saint is taken to the sea for blessing.

More interesting are his photographs of men gathered in Union Square to argue about world events, of the dining room of a hall for the elderly, and of several clean-cut boys learning the prayers and traditions of the synagogue. Mr. Eagle's photographs do not carry the weight of such ominous images as those taken by Roman Vishniac of impoverished Eastern European Jews shortly before the Holocaust.

Detective Rudolph Zitti and his partner, Officer Raymond Ruiz, received a tip on Friday that the suspect, Jose Batista, 23, had just arrived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, said Sergeant Tina Mohrmann, a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department. Grabbed Detective's Pistol    Eight plainclothes officers began a stakeout in the neighborhood, the police said. Mr. Batista was spotted at 10:54 P.M. Friday as he walked near 2875 Sedgwick Avenue, just south of Reservoir Avenue, the sergeant said. When the officers approached him, he ran and they gave chase, she said.   During the pursuit, Mr. Batista picked up a stick and swung at the officers, the police said. The officers cornered him and tried to subdue him, but he grabbed Detective Zitti's service pistol and fired one shot, grazing the detective on the hand, Sergeant Mohrmann said. Officer Ruiz then fired one shot, striking Mr. Batista in the head, she said. Mr. Batista, whose address is unknown, died at the scene, the police said.   Detective Zitti was treated at Montefiore Medical Center for the graze wound and released. Officer Ruiz was treated at the hospital for trauma and released. Investigation Continuing    Sergeant Mohrmann said a preliminary investigation had concluded that the shooting was justified. She said the investigation is continuing.   Mr. Batista is suspected of being involved in a burglary of a house at 442 Fifth Street in Elmont, L.I., on Dec. 21, 1991, said Detective Frederic Eno, a Nassau County Police spokesman.   Officer Christopher Pohren was one of several officers who responded to a burglary alarm and caught four armed men leaving the house, Detective Eno said.

Robert Silverberg's KINGDOMS OF THE WALL (Spectra/Bantam, $22.95) is a parable about the danger of seeking more intimate contact with the powers that control the universe. On a distant planet a race of people who superficially resemble humans lives at the foot of a mountain so steep and so tall that it is known as the Wall. Their myths tell of a Prometheus-like First Climber who ascended the Wall and brought back useful knowledge from the gods who live at the summit. In honor of this First Climber, the people periodically choose 40 of their best and brightest as Pilgrims, who try to climb the Wall and parley with the gods. Most fail to return; those who do are invariably mad, and their reports of what they have seen at the summit make little sense.   The band of Pilgrims to whom Mr. Silverberg directs our attention has better luck. The Wall turns out to be an entire range of mountains offering trial after trial as horrific as any observered by Dante in the Inferno. Many former Pilgrims have ended up in the clutches of monsters capable of stealing one's body, mind and will. The author makes some attempt to distinguish between these monsters, and there are hints that each Pilgrim's fate is determined by his or her character. But since the only Pilgrims we get to know well are those who escape the monsters, the fate of the less fortunate seems more arbitrary than ordained. Higher up the Wall, the obstacles become more subtle; some regions are so pleasant that the Pilgrims are tempted to settle down and forget their mission. What awaits those who persevere is a revelation that calls into question everything they believe (although it will hardly come as a surprise to the seasoned reader of science fiction).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930314","headline":"THE BLIZZARD OF '93: The Past; '93 Storm Seeks Its Place in History","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/nyregion/the-blizzard-of-93-the-past-93-storm-seeks-its-place-in-history.html","abstract":"  Big as it may be, the Blizzard of '93, is, by far, not \"the mother of all storms,\" as some prognosticators had hyped it.

He called himself Black Francis in 1988 when his group, the Pixies, became the rage of Boston's college radio stations.

If anyone in avant-rock circles cared about coherent storytelling, however, the Pixies would have drawn fire for Black Francis's willfully obscure or trifling song lyrics.  Enigmatic titles like \"Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons\" and amorphous refrains like \"If man is five/ Then the devil is six\" got a free ride on abrasive chords and clustered drumbeats. Ever since hard-core punk obliterated articulation and a mumbling Michael Stipe of R.E.M. triumphed with mood over meaning a decade ago, it has been gauche to demand that a song yield more than an evocative phrase or two.

Before the novel was half done, however, I decided to abandon it.

The alert came as South Korea's military exercises with the United States continued well south of the heavily armed demilitarized zone. North Korea has called the exercises a rehearsal for staging an invasion, and cited them a reason that it became the first nation ever to renounce the treaty. The United States says the annual exercises, which began in 1976, are purely defensive. - Leaders of the South Korean Government of President Kim Young Sam, who took office two weeks ago, spent most of the day in meetings deciding how to respond to North Korea's surprise action. But so far Seoul has said little, other than to say that the action \"heightens the suspicion\" that North Korea is developing nuclear arms. Along with the United States and Japan, South Korea has called on North Korea to retract its decision before it becomes effective in 90 days.   \"There are a lot of discussions about what to do next, but the border is very quiet,\" Ryu Myung Hwan, the spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said this afternoon.   Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Friday that he believed North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty and its refusal to allow inspection of two suspected nuclear sites would likely be taken up by the United Nations Security Council unless the hard-line Communist Government of President Kim Il Sung reversed its course. Today in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, officials repeated their warnings to the United States and other nations not to press for economic sanctions or other pressure in response to North Korea's decision, according to reports on the official state news service monitored in Tokyo.

But for budget-conscious travelers there is an alternative: You can rent an apartment, as we did on three separate occasions last summer, fall and winter, and live like Russians -- for about $15 a night. The advantages go beyond savings: You can experience some of the Russian hospitality that guidebooks celebrate but visitors seldom feel on guided tours or in luxury hotels. Our landlords have invited us for meals in their homes and suffocated us with kindness, as if we were distant relatives from a planet called Amerika. You have a place to entertain Russian friends or business associates, many of whom may find it difficult to get past the tight security at hotels catering to foreigners. Even the most sophisticated Russians, moreover, could feel self-conscious sitting around a dinner table in an upscale restaurant while their countrymen suffer food shortages. Lastly, in a land where greasy borscht, fried meat and potatoes are often the norm, you can cook and drink as you please in your own apartment. For early risers, this means not having to wait until 8 A.M., when most hotel restaurants open, for that first cup of coffee.\n\nSkeptical gourmets can breathe easy, too. Every good-sized city now has dollar-only grocery stores. Most are no larger than a 7-Eleven and are stocked with German milk, Finnish yogurt, British cornflakes and French wine, as well as such sundries as Dutch disposable diapers. Of course, to really feel Russian, there's no substitute for standing in line at the local bakery for a \"baton\" of fresh white bread or one of several coarse brown and black loaves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930314","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/realestate/c-corrections-899093.html","abstract":"  A report in the Postings column on Jan. 31 about a new ornamental pergola for the New York Yacht Club identified the architects of Grand Central Terminal incompletely.

In the 1960's the columns were collected and went through two editions. Some of them have now been translated by William Weaver and will be published in paperback in May by Harcourt Brace & Company as a Helen and Kurt Wolff Book under the title \"Misreadings.\" The excerpts below are taken from a piece titled \"Regretfully, We Are Returning Your . . .\" -- reports from professional readers of manuscripts submitted to publishers by agents or hopeful authors.\n\n\"The Bible.\" Anonymous.\n\nI must say that the first few hundred pages of this manuscript really hooked me. Action-packed, they have everything today's reader wants in a good story. Sex (lots of it, including adultery, sodomy, incest), also murder, war, massacres and so on.\n\nThe Sodom and Gomorrah chapter, with the transvestites putting the make on the angels, is worthy of Rabelais; the Noah stories are pure Jules Verne; the escape from Egypt cries out to be turned into a major motion picture. In other words, a real blockbuster, very well structured, with plenty of twists, full of invention, with just the right amount of piety, and never lapsing into tragedy.\n\nBut as I kept on reading, I realized that this is actually an anthology, involving several writers, with many -- too many -- stretches of poetry, and passages that are downright mawkish and boring, and jeremiads that make no sense.\n\nThe end result is a monster omnibus. It seems to have something for everybody, but ends up appealing to nobody. And acquiring the rights from all these different authors will mean big headaches, unless the editor takes care of that himself. The editor's name, by the way, doesn't appear anywhere on the manuscript, not even in the table of contents. Is there some reason for keeping his identity a secret?\n\nI'd suggest trying to get the rights only to the first five chapters. We're on sure ground there. Also come up with a better title. How about \"The Red Sea Desperadoes?\"\n\"The Odyssey.\" Homer. \n\nPersonally, I like this book. A good yarn, exciting, packed with adventure. Sufficient love interest, both marital fidelity and adulterous flings (Calypso is a great character, a real man-eater); there's even a Lolita aspect, with the teen-ager Nausicaa, where the author doesn't spell things out, but it's a turn-on anyway. Great dramatic moments, a one-eyed giant, cannibals, even some drugs, but nothing illegal, because as far as I know the lotus isn't on the Narcotics Bureau's list. The final scene is in the best tradition of the Western: some heavy fist-swinging, and the business with the bow is a masterstroke of suspense.\n\nWhat can I say? It's a page turner, all right, not like the author's first book, which was too static, all concerned with unity of place and tediously overplotted. By the time the reader reached the third battle and the 10th duel, he already got the idea. But this second book is a totally different thing: it reads as smooth as silk. The tone is calmer, pondered but not ponderous. And then the montage, the use of flashbacks, the stories within stories. . . . In a word, this Homer is the right stuff. He's smart.\n\nToo smart, maybe. I wonder if it's all really his own work. I know, of course, a writer can improve with experience (his third book will probably be a sensation), but what makes me uncomfortable -- and, finally, leads me to cast a negative vote -- is the mess the question of rights will cause. In the first place, the author's nowhere to be found. People who knew him say it was always hard to discuss any changes to be made in the text, because he was as blind as a bat, couldn't follow the manuscript, and even gave the impression he wasn't completely familiar with it. Did he really write the book or did he just sign it?\n\"The Divine Comedy.\" Alighieri, Dante.\n\nAlighieri is your typical Sunday writer. (In everyday life he's an active member of the pharmacists' guild.) Still, his work shows an undeniable grasp of technique and considerable narrative flair. The book, in the Florentine dialect, consists of about a hundred rhymed chapters, and much of it is interesting and readable. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of astronomy and certain concise, provocative theological notions. The third part of the book is the best and will have the widest appeal; it involves subjects of general interest, concerns of the common reader -- salvation, the Beatific Vision, prayers to the Virgin. But the first part is obscure and self-indulgent, with passages of cheap eroticism, violence and downright crudity. But the greatest drawback is the author's choice of his local dialect (inspired no doubt by some crackpot avant-garde idea). We all know that today's Latin needs a shot in the arm -- it isn't just the little literary cliques that insist on this. But there's a limit, after all, if not in the rules of language then at least to the public's ability to understand.\n\"Justine.\" Sade, D. A. Francois.\n\nThe manuscript was in a whole pile of things I had to look at this week and, to be honest, I haven't read it through. I opened it at random three times, in three different places, which, as you know, is enough for a trained eye.\n\nWell, the first time I found an avalanche of words, page after page, about the philosophy of nature, with digressions on the cruelty of the struggle for survival, the reproduction of plants, and the cycles of animal species. The second time: at least 15 pages on the concept of pleasure, the senses and the imagination, and so on. The third time: 20 pages on the question of submission between men and women in various countries of the world. I think that's enough. We're not looking for a work of philosophy. Today's audience wants sex, sex, and more sex. In every shape and form.\n\"A la Recherche du Temps Perdu.\" Proust, Marcel.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a serious work, perhaps too long, but as a paperback series it could sell.\n\nBut it won't do as is. It needs serious editing. For example, the punctuation has to be redone. The sentences are too labored; some take up a whole page. With plenty of good in-house work, reducing each sentence to a maximum of two or three lines, breaking up paragraphs, indenting more often, the book would be enormously improved.\n\nIf the author doesn't agree, then forget it. As it stands, the book is too -- what's the word? -- asthmatic.\n\"Critique of Practical Reason.\" Kant, Immanuel.\n\nI asked Susan to take a look at this, and she tells me that after Barthes there's no point translating this Kant. In any case, I glanced at it myself. A reasonably short book on morality could fit nicely into our philosophy series, and might even be adopted by some universities. But the German publisher says that if we take this one, we have to commit ourselves not only to the author's previous book, which is an immense thing in at least two volumes, but also to the one he is working on now, about art or about judgment, I'm not sure which. All three books have more or less the same title, so they would have to be sold boxed (and at a price no reader could afford); otherwise bookshop browsers would mistake one for the other and think, \"I've already read this.\"\n\nThere's another problem. The German agent tells me that we would also have to publish the minor works of this Kant, a whole pile of stuff including something about astronomy. I would advise against getting involved with a man like this; we'll end up with a mountain of his books in the warehouse.\n\"The Trial.\" Kafka, Franz.\n\nNice little book. A thriller with some Hitchcock touches. The final murder, for example. It could have an audience.\n\nBut apparently the author wrote under a regime with heavy censorship. Otherwise, why all these vague references, this trick of not giving names to people or places? And why is the protagonist being put on trial? If we clarify these points and make the setting more concrete (facts are needed: facts, facts, facts), then the action will be easier to follow and suspense is assured. Genuine writing has to keep in mind the old newspaperman's five questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? If we can have a free hand with editing, I'd say buy it. If not, not.\n\"Finnegans Wake.\" Joyce, James.\n\nPlease, tell the office manager to be more careful when he sends books out to be read. I'm the English-language reader, and you've sent me a book written in some other, Godforsaken language. I'm returning it under separate cover.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930314","headline":"Sports of The Times; New Ice Age Has Struck The Big East","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/sports/sports-of-the-times-new-ice-age-has-struck-the-big-east.html","abstract":"  AGIANT depression looms over the Big East tournament, packing high winds and slippery underfooting, making for hazardous travel conditions.

It halted Bobby Bonilla in his tracks in right field, cleared the outfield fence, kept going right on over the plateau of ground beyond. Darryl Strawberry, months after back surgery, is healthy, dangerous and, of course, eminently quotable.   \"Has anyone asked, and can the Mets ever explain, how they could get rid of all the talent they had?\" asked Strawberry. \"The fans in New York know their baseball. I'm sure they are asking what happened to their players.\"   The players Strawberry was talking about, of course, have gone a lot of places -- into retirement, to free agency, off to other clubs in trades of debatable merit. Others have come in, and the results have not been special. The Mets, who declined to bid seriously for Strawberry after the 1990 season, have finished fifth twice since Strawberry left, and the giant contracts they have handed out to others have generated scarcely any dividends to date.   \"I don't even know who they are,\" Strawberry said of the Mets. 'New York's a Hard Town'    The club's anonymity for Strawberry is not total. He doesn't need to be reminded that Vince Coleman is there, a base-stealer signed for nearly as much as the Mets offered Strawberry. He knows full well Bobby Bonilla is in New York, under siege and all over the headlines.   \"New York's a hard town,\" said Strawberry. \"I think people, over time, have realized how tough I was.\"   He was updated on the details of Bonilla's most recent difficult week. His reaction mixed understanding and advice. It was not, however, exactly suffused with sympathy.   \"You put your hand in the fire, and that's what you are going to have to deal with,\" said Strawberry. \"He's in a fireplace. And he's making big money. They want you to put the club on your back and carry it.\"   Asked if Bonilla were up to the load, Strawberry, who bears Bonilla no personal animus, hedged.   \"You can't judge what kind of player he is,\" Strawberry said of the Mets' current right fielder. \"When the pressure is on, you have to rise above it. And I'm quite sure he's feeling a lot of pressure.\" He Has Heard That Before    He was told of Bonilla's being booed here in spring-training games.   \"It's a town that can make you or break you,\" said Strawberry. \"Hey, they booed me in spring, too. He got the big contract, I didn't. He has to learn to accept the boos.\"   Bonilla's strategy, said Strawberry, should not be to look to escape, but to, by force of will and talent, reverse it all.   \"The way you answer it is put the fans on their feet,\" said Strawberry. \"I didn't run and hide. I had my share of run-ins. But I didn't let it stop me from doing what I had to do.\"   Strawberry believes he can at long last get back to doing what he does best -- manufacturing nearly mythic home runs, like the one he hit today against Frank Tanana.   \"It's been hard days of hard work,\" said Stawberry, who underwent back surgery on Sept. 15. \"When they cut on your back, you never know what's going to happen. When they tried to get me to walk after surgery, it was scary. I thought I might never be able to walk like a normal person. But I worked my way up to be able to walk. And now, I'm almost comfortable out there.\"   Today, Strawberry sounded as if he'd be quite comfortable back in right feld at Shea. He won't be, of course. Bobby Bonilla will be there, and Strawberry had no sure prescription for making that work.   INSIDE PITCH    JOHN FRANCO, the recovering closer for the Mets, pitched to live batters Sunday for the first time this spring. \"It's almost there,\" said Franco. \"I asked the guys I faced in B.P., and they all said my velocity was there.

Poseidon Press. $19.     It's hard not to compare \"The Law of Falling Bodies,\" Jill Ciment's radiant first novel, with Mona Simpson's \"Anywhere but Here\" (1986). Both novels feature impossible, eccentric mothers, who are blinded by the glitter of their own fickle dreams, and their conflicted daughters, torn between filial devotion and a desperate need to make independent lives of their own. Both take place on the road to and in California. And both mark the debuts of writers blessed with an uncommon gift for language.   \"Falling Bodies\" isn't as ambitious a book as \"Anywhere but Here\": it doesn't tackle a whole slice of contemporary history or attempt to reinvent traditional literary myths, as Ms. Simpson's remarkable novel did. Instead, Ms. Ciment (pronounced sih-MENT) contents herself with telling the whimsical story of a single mother and daughter. Yet in fulfilling her modest aims, the book completely beguiles the reader. It is sad, funny and affecting, completely assured in its portrayal of the complicated mathematics of family emotions: one of those novels you want to mail to friends.   Told in first person, \"Falling Bodies\" is the story of Kimberly and her efforts to come to terms with her mother, Gloria. Gloria Gail -- the name seems meant to recall Dorothy Gael, who crossed the rainbow to Oz -- is one of those inveterate dreamers, who's convinced that a gold mine lies just beyond the horizon, that a jackpot has just eluded her reach. She's a kind of female Gatsby, someone eerily attuned to the romantic possibilities of life.   \"My mother didn't care about a bigger house or a swimming pool,\" Kim recalls. \"Possessions, in point of fact, held no interest whatsoever for her. What my mother was after, had always been after, was something outside of material gain, something that rendered the big house empty, the pool drained of meaning. I'd seen my mother standing in front of a gumball machine with prizes, as transfixed by the plastic jewelry, squirt guns and jawbreakers as Cortes was by the Aztecs' gold. Obviously, at 44 years old, it was inconsequential to her what the machine would expel, a tutti-frutti sucker or a brass ring. Yet each time she dropped another copper penny into the slot, her breath caught.\" She lived, dreamed and breathed \"for those exalted moments between the promise and the prize.\"    Charming, compulsive and almost endlessly hopeful, Gloria spends her days and nights drinking coffee and dreaming up schemes that run the gamut from insurance scams to pyramid games to the marketing of bizarre new products. Though she has sold Geiger counters, weight-loss potions and treadmills for pets, Gloria's specialty is an aphrodisiac perfume. For years now, she has driven from town to town in California and Nevada, selling vials of this magic elixir from her car trunk, and she has dragged her daughter with her. By the time Kim is 15, she has attended 12 elementary schools and two junior highs. She has lived in 13 trailer parks and driven over 90,000 miles. She hopes that when the numbers on the car's odometer reach zero again, \"our lives could begin anew.\"    Fate intervenes in the shape of a 40-something widower, a kind, patient man named Arthur, who one day drives smack into Kim and Gloria's trailer. Gloria refuses to go to a hospital -- she's wanted for mail fraud and is scared of talking to the police -- and Arthur sheepishly allows her and Kim to recuperate in his house.   Much to everyone's surprise, the three soon settle into a comfortable domestic routine. Kim feels she has finally found a home. Arthur feels he has finally found a family. And Gloria, well, Gloria feels she can still come up with an idea that will bring her hope and glory.   As the weeks and months pass, however, Kim begins to fall in love with Arthur. Though she knows her mother has already shared Arthur's bed, she makes a clumsy, girlish effort to seduce him. The following day, Arthur abruptly disappears, leaving Kim and Gloria his house. By the end of the summer, they realize he is not coming back.   Kim eventually goes off to college, gets a job and tries to begin a new life. She's tired of her mother's delusions, her self-absorption, her relentless scheming. Gloria, meanwhile, resumes her itinerant life as a peddler of perfume. Her ambition now is to become a guest on the new \"What's My Line\" television show. She dreams of stumping the panel and becoming a cult figure, a kind of Lucille Ball.   Improbably enough, Kim meets Arthur again, and quits her job to move in with him. It is only when her mother suddenly resurfaces, desperate, needy and finally, it seems, willing to abandon her dreams, that Kim realizes she cannot escape her past, that she may very well have to choose between her mother and her new bourgeois life with Arthur.   In summary, such events may feel cartoonish and contrived, but as related by Ms. Ciment, they take on a palpable weight of emotion. There is a sweetness, as well as an acerbic humor, to her writing, and these qualities burnish the story of Gloria and Kim with a warm, affectionate glow.

This was the last of four Bullets games played in Baltimore this season, and Washington's only victory. Harvey Grant's 15-foot jumper with 1 minute 4 seconds left in the game gave Washington the lead for good.   Cleveland shot 64 percent from the field in the first half and took a 58-46 halftime lead. In the second half, the Cavaliers slipped to 44 percent, scoring only 19 points in the fourth quarter.   \"We sat around for three days, and we just came out not sharp, and we did not have any enthusiasm,\" said Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens. \"We did not play well as far as I was concerned.\"   In the Central Division race, Cleveland dropped to two and a half games behind first-place Chicago.   In the fourth quarter, the lead changed hands seven times before Washington scored 10 straight points to take a 99-90 lead with 4:21 left. Cleveland then went on a 9-0 run and tied the game at 101-101 on a basket by John Battle with 2:14 remaining.   Grant hit his go-ahead jumper a minute later.   Tom Gugliotta led Washington with 23 points and 10 rebounds, while Grant added 21 points and LaBradford Smith 20.   Brad Daugherty led the Cavaliers with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Bulls 101, Clippers 94    Because of double-teaming on Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, B. J. Armstrong took charge and scored a career-high 28 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, as Chicago won at home.   Pippen also finished strongly, scoring 11 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Jordan had 23.   After a layup by Stanley Roberts with 2:56 left cut Chicago's lead to 91-90, Pippen countered with a 3-point field goal. Armstrong scored the Bulls' last 7 points -- with a 3-pointer and four free throws. Heat 103, Nuggets 100    Glen Rice scored 30 points, hitting two key 3-pointers in overtime, as Miami rallied from a 7-point deficit in the extra period to win in Denver.   It was the Heat's ninth victory in the last 10 games.   A pair of free throws by Bryant Stith, a 16-foot jumper by Tom Hammonds and a 3-point play by Robert Pack put Denver ahead by 98-91 with 3:25 left in overtime.   But Grant Long hit a pair of free throws, Rice connected on a 3-pointer and Bimbo Coles hit a 14-foot jumper to tie the score at 98-98. After a Denver turnover, Rice hit another 3-pointer with 1:32 left to put the Heat ahead to stay.   Jackson's 22-foot jumper with 1:15 left accounted for Denver's last points. Smith hit a pair of free throws for the Heat with 11.6 seconds remaining, and Stith and Reggie Williams both missed 3-pointers before time expired.   Denver's Dikembe Mutombo had a career-high 23 rebounds but only 8 points. Lakers 92, Spurs 87    James Worthy scored 24 points and Vlade Divac and Byron Scott added 17 each as Los Angeles defeated the Spurs for the Lakers' second victory in San Antonio this season.   Los Angeles, which played three games in four days, finished a five-game road trip at 3-2.   David Robinson led the Spurs with 26 points as San Antonio lost for just the sixth time at home. But the center was held to just 4 first-half points, and San Antonio's power-forward tandem of J. R. Reid and Antoine Carr combined for only 13 points all night.   The Lakers led by 76-71 with five minutes to play when Anthony Peeler hit a 3-point shot and Divac followed with a free throw to put San Antonio 9 points behind.   San Antonio Coach John Lucas, 28-11 since replacing Jerry Tarkanian, attributed the loss to the 23 turnovers. Sean Elliott had 17 points but 7 turnovers.   Lakers center Benoit Benjamin was ejected with 9:16 left in the game for flagrantly fouling Sean Elliott on a drive to the basket. Jazz 109, Mavericks 96    Karl Malone rebounded from one of his poorest performances of the season by scoring 36 points, and Utah won in Dallas to extend the Mavericks' club-record losing streak to 19 games.   The Mavericks have lost the 19 games by an average margin of 20 points.   If Dallas loses to visiting Orlando tomorrow, it will tie the league record for consecutive defeats in a season, held by the 1972-73 76ers.   Malone scored 15 points before being ejected in the fourth quarter of a 104-95 loss to Houston on Saturday. Against Dallas, he hit 12 of 17 field-goal attempts and 12 of 13 free throws, and added 8 rebounds.   With next season's coach, Quinn Buckner, in attendance, the Mavericks turned in a rare competitive first half, trailing by just 49-44 at intermission. Utah broke the game open in the third quarter, using a 21-8 run over the first 6:27 to build a 70-52 lead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"Hwang Play Closes After 8 Previews","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/theater/hwang-play-closes-after-8-previews.html","abstract":"  \"Face Value,\" the troubled $2 million farce by David Henry Hwang that was to open on Broadway on Sunday, has closed after eight previews at the Cort Theater.

At the same time, South Korean officials said they wanted to avoid any action that would corner the Government of President Kim Il Sung or risk military conflicts. \"We must make all efforts to resolve this in a peaceful manner and not to make the situation worse,\" Han Sung Joo, South Korea's Foreign Minister, said today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"Critic's Notebook; Television Catches Up To the Era Of Jazz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/movies/critic-s-notebook-television-catches-up-to-the-era-of-jazz.html","abstract":"  Jazz is humming these days. At home, I find myself returning again and again to a Miles Davis CD called \"Kind of Blue,\" evoking memories of 1960's late-night visits to the old Five Spot bar in the East Village, where a typical bill would include Ornette Coleman and Jimmy Giuffre. Around me, friends are talking enthusiastically about the current jazz series at Lincoln Center. And perhaps most significant, television is plugging in to the jazz boom, just beginning to make up for its shameful decades-long neglect of this country's major original musical form.    Why now? Maybe it has something to do with Bill Clinton and his saxophone. Certainly the Marsalis brothers, especially Wynton and Branford, figure prominently in the renaissance. Or perhaps the deaths of Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie have reminded music lovers of how much they may have been taking for granted about a priceless heritage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"The Cold Facts On TV Skating","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/sports/the-cold-facts-on-tv-skating.html","abstract":"  The women's finals of the world figure-skating championships on NBC scored a 12.4 overnight rating and a 19 share Saturday night in A.C.
