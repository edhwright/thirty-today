Morrison made a singularly bizarre defense of his World Boxing Organization crown last night, scoring a fourth-round technical knockout over Tim Tomashek, a flabby, last-minute replacement. About an hour before the 12-round bout, Mike Williams withdrew, prompting his own manager to call him \"yellow.\" Promoter Bob Arum said Williams refused to take the pre-fight drug test. It was the first defense for Morrison (38-1), who is to fight Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion, in March. He was hoping for a good fight before his hometown Kansas City fans. \"It's an odd feeling; it's a bad feeling,\" Morrison said. \"There's not much I can say. . . . At least it was not my fault.\"   Williams is a former sparring partner of Morrison's who lost to him in a fictionalized fight in the movie \"Rocky V.\" \"The official word is Mike turned yellow and left,\" Williams's manager, Bob Jordan, said. After three rounds, the 28-year-old Tomashek's eyes were puffy and bruised and the ringside physician and referee would not allow him to continue. Fans threw ice chips into the ring when the announcement of the technical knockout was made.

Not a bad sampling for one of this country's most important new-music festivals.   And if some musical styles were underrepresented -- the recent experimentation with vernacular forms, or samplings of new West Coast or Eastern European composition, for instance -- and if too many minor works were included, this was nevertheless an effective farewell for Oliver Knussen, the British composer who began directing the festival seven years ago. Without becoming too clearly identified with any single school, he has given a fair hearing to all. His tenure has been marked by notable highlights and has earned obvious respect from students and colleagues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930831","headline":"A Lukewarm Opening Day For Tennis's Hottest Ticket","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/31/sports/us-open-93-a-lukewarm-opening-day-for-tennis-s-hottest-ticket.html","abstract":"  Under a deadening film of humidity, and under fire for a deadly opening-day program that was nearly seed-free, the United States Open got off to an inauspicious beginning yesterday.

David Letterman's new \"Late Show,\" the version of his talk show reinvented for a larger, presumably more wide-awake audience, turns out to be as savvy and caustic as its NBC incarnation. Although Mr. Letterman began his new stint on Monday night with obviously rekindled energy, the show's actual format was remarkably close to its predecessor's. Actionably close, as a matter of fact, and of course Mr. Letterman made his legal skirmish with NBC one of the night's main sources of fun.   Striding onto the stage of a handsomely refurbished Ed Sullivan Theater, to an introduction wittily patched together from old Ed Sullivan clips (Mr. Letterman was variously \"a fabulous boy prodigy,\" \"my handsome Italian paisano\" and \"the most amazing of all the chimp acts ever to come on the show\"), CBS's new star wickedly took aim at his old employers. \"Legally, I can continue to call myself Dave,\" he explained, while also claiming to have found a peacock's head in his bed. Along came the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, obviously a man who enjoys living dangerously, to wish Mr. Letterman \"reasonably well\" and to confiscate a couple of cue cards, saying they were the intellectual property of NBC. Not surprisingly, Mr. Letterman found a lot to work with there, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930901","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/01/nyregion/news-summary-468793.html","abstract":"  International A2-9  SEPARATE TABLES, SEPARATE TALKS  Mideast peace negotiations resumed in Washington, but the real action was in Europe, where Israel and the P.L.O. worked secretly on statements of mutual recognition.

The darkness, of course, exists only for the people onstage, since everything that happens after the electricity has gone, in the world of the play, is performed in a blaze of stage lights amid John Lee Beatty's vibrant Pop/Op setting.   Since its New York debut in 1967, with a cast that included Michael Crawford, Lynn Redgrave and Geraldine Page, \"Black Comedy\" has had a healthy life in American community and university theaters, and one can see why. It is, for its first half-hour, almost foolproof comically. It not only offers a novel occasion for the eternal gymnastics of elemental farce: people falling down stairs, bumping into doors and furniture and mistakenly groping each other. It also, in showing twittish characters trying to maintain their customary social rituals in a world deprived of visual cues, coaxes the latent absurdity out of those rituals, and even the process of mixing a cocktail courts burlesque disaster.
