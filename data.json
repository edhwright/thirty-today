Scott Fitzgerald said that there are no second acts in American lives, but the Republican Party aims to give it a try. The G.O.P. wants to recreate the glory days of 1981, when President Reagan pushed a budget through Congress by rallying enough conservative Democrats to his side to get a majority. Now the Republican Congressional leaders say they will attempt to persuade a handful of  Democratic senators and at least 55 Democratic House members to provide a two-thirds majority for their seven-year balanced budget plan that could withstand a veto from President Clinton. \n\n     On the surface, the Republican scheme is plausible enough. There are plenty of Democrats in the House who are close to the Republicans on many issues and not too fond of Mr. Clinton. But the odds seem to be against the latest Republican gambit because of an important historical shift that, ironically enough, can be traced back to Mr. Reagan's budget adventures of 15 years ago.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960116","headline":"Australia Knocks on the Door, and Southeast Asia Hears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/16/opinion/IHT-australia-knocks-on-the-door-and-southeast-asia-hears.html","abstract":"Australia's relations with Southeast Asia have taken an extraordinary leap forward in the past month in developments that could have a lasting impact on the region.
