They'll have no part it. They respect the Cowboys, but they are not in awe of them. The Giants even seem to be a little cocky, if you go by some of the comments they made today. And they drew a critical response from Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson as the two teams turned up the volume in anticipation of their meeting Sunday in Texas.   Giants players talked about last year's Thanksgiving Day game at Texas Stadium, a 30-3 blowout won by the Cowboys. Toward the end of the game, with the Cowboys in complete control, they were blitzing quarterback Dave Brown, then a rookie. The Giants interpreted that as an attempt to humiliate them.   Call it trying to find emotional incentives for Sunday's game, call it whatever you wish, but some of the Giants talked about that game as if it were one of the greatest insults of all time.   \"You don't forget things like that,\" said defensive end Keith Hamilton. \"Dallas is the type of team that if you go down, they are going for the jugular. That left a bad taste in my mouth. They had us down and just tried to kick us. You don't forget that. I know I didn't.\"   Linebacker Corey Miller said: \"Jimmy Johnson is a coach that when you're down, he'll keep kicking and stomping. We remember what happened last year.\"   Johnson, told later in the day of those remarks, was clearly irked. \"It's a simple deal,\" said Johnson. \"They were trying to score, we were trying to stop them. I did not see their quarterback take a knee. If the quarterback takes a knee, we stop blitzing. I didn't see anybody pull back on us in 1989.\"   Johnson was referring to the Cowboys' 1-15 season in 1989, when teams were pummeling the sorry Cowboys.   Miller was the most vocal of the Giants players. And he can probably talk all he wants since he is having an outstanding season. Miller can back the talk. And although he didn't say anything shocking, his comments are indicative of how many of the Giants feel. That is, people are already awarding the division crown to Dallas. Miller said he believes that the Cowboys are a great team and do have a shot at winning the rest of their games. But he also said they are \"definitely beatable\" and \"not as good as they were last year.\"   \"I think defensively they're not as strong,\" said Miller. \"I don't think their linebackers are playing as well as they did last year. I think with our linemen, they can power them. But they're a good football team.\"    Dallas has dropped off slightly from last season. It ranks seventh in the National Football League in total defense. The Cowboys spent much of last season as the league's No. 1 ranked defense. Cowboy Vows Defense Will Improve    \"I'm getting tired of hearing about our run defense,\" said Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson. \"We've struggled the last couple of weeks, but we can play better than that. We will prove it this week. You can quote that.\"   Miller said that one of the reasons for the defensive dropoff was the loss of defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt, now the head coach of the Chicago Bears.   \"To me, they're just not as good,\" Miller said. \"That's my opinion. They're a great football team. I'm not saying they're not. But it's not like they can't be beat.\" An Endorsement From Smith    They're not likely to be beat if running back Emmitt Smith has the kind of day he did against the Eagles -- 30 carries for 237 yards, the sixth-highest single-game total ever. The Giants know that Dallas has only two or three running plays -- the problem is, no one can stop them. That's because of Smith.    But he isn't taking the Giants' defense for granted.   \"I think they're playing with a lot more confidence this year,\" said Smith. \"I think they have a great defensive scheme over there. They're pursuing the ball, they're getting after the ballcarrier. They're forcing some bad plays, and they're making a bunch of great plays also.\"   The Giants have allowed just one rushing touchdown this season and only 87 rushing yards a game, second in the conference.   \"I just don't see him getting 200 yards against our defense,\" Miller said. EXTRA POINTS    LAWRENCE TAYLOR spent most of practice Wednesday riding a stationary bike as he tries to rest his hamstring injury. Coach DAN REEVES said he was doubtful for Sunday's game, but the Giants will know more tomorrow. Running back RODNEY HAMPTON practiced for the first time since injuring his left knee almost a month ago. He looked fine and Reeves said he expects him to start.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"Chinese Issuing What May Be Deng's Final Book","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/chinese-issuing-what-may-be-deng-s-final-book.html","abstract":"  China's top Communist Party officials appeared to be preparing for the death of their paramount leader this week by issuing what is likely to be the final volume of Deng Xiaoping's private speeches.

But the honors of the evening went to an artist of a rather different kind, Carmen de Lavallade, whose choreography and performing were a highlight of the enjoyably varied program.    Both Trisler, who died in 1979, and Ms. de Lavallade were trained in dance technique and the art of the theater by Lester Horton, a West Coast dance original.

It veered between traditional and modern styles and from professional to amateur performances. And it portrayed an extremely diverse musical culture, even as singers drew fervent applause when they invoked Albanian unity. There are Albanian communities in the former Yugoslavia, in Greece and even in Italy; one dance from the Arberesh community in Italy suggested a Balkan tarantella.    Musically, Albania is where Eastern Europe meets the Middle East. Singers crooned, quavered or used the tight microtonal ornaments of Middle Eastern music; one singer, Besim Muriqi, put his hand to his ear and sang over his bent elbow in strong, trumpetlike tones, a style once used to project messages from mountain to mountain. The local two-stringed lute, the cifteli, was sometimes used like an Arabic oud, in unison with a voice, and sometimes in fiercely strummed rhythms with drones, which is closer to other Balkan music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"Mr. Giuliani's Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/opinion/mr-giuliani-s-victory.html","abstract":"  The insults flew until the the polls closed, but when the the vote was in, Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani put aside the bitterness that marked their campaign and behaved with a decency and civility that made New Yorkers proud of both men.

Even more impressive was the grudging respect accorded Mr. Kollek by the resentful Arab third of Jerusalem's 550,000 inhabitants.    At 82, having lost an election he reluctantly contested, Mayor Kollek bows out at an awkward moment.

Many more will be there to watch the Tigers' star running back, Keith Elias, than Penn's quarterback, Jimmy McGeehan.   The unheralded McGeehan doesn't mind. He is thrilled to be a part of the mild turbulence that has been mounting in his home city this week. \"It's great,\" he said. \"A little excitement will help. I was reading in the paper the other day where college football in Philadelphia is way down.\"   It is fitting that McGeehan will be playing such an important role in this game between two 7-0 teams whose likely prize is the Ivy League championship. He is all Philadelphia, from the East Falls section up near City Line, a graduate of Roman Catholic High School downtown and a Phillies fan.   His brother, John, also a quarterback, helped Penn win two Ivy championships, in 1983 and 1984, and is now a district attorney in Philadelphia. His father, John, works as a power director for Philadelphia Electric and his mother, Mary, is a legal secretary. A Key Role    McGeehan's role on Saturday is important because he must sustain the Penn offense to keep the Princeton offense off the field. Princeton's Elias has been running through defenses for three years and if the Quakers are to win this game they cannot allow the Tiger tailback to have the ball 30 times, or even 20 times.   McGeehan is ready for the task. A senior, he has had a superb season as a cool director of an offense that has averaged 33 points a game and made few mistakes. There have been only 12 turnovers and just 34 punts.   \"He may now be the best quarterback in the Ivy League,\" said Steve Tosches, the Princeton coach. That's a real tribute because the competition includes such good quarterbacks as Dartmouth's Jay Fiedler, Harvard's Mike Giardi, Cornell's Bill Lazor and Princeton's Joel Foote.   There is nothing fancy about McGeehan, a 6-foot, 190-pound drop-back passer good at reading defenses and getting the ball to the right receiver. He has two excellent targets in Chris Brassell and Miles Macik. Brassell averages 20 yards a catch and Macik has averaged seven receptions a game in a balanced offense that also features a 156-pound tailback, Terrance Stokes, who averages 111 yards rushing each game.   Stokes is an inside power runner. \"He's tough,\" says McGeehan, free with his compliments. \"Our offensive line has been great. I have hardly been touched in seven games.\"  An Upset of Dartmouth    The first game, an upset of defending Ivy League champion Dartmouth in which McGeehan outperformed Fiedler, gave a hint of what the Penn quarterback had become.   There had been more downs than ups in his first two seasons. He was benched late in his sophomore year as the coach, Gary Steele, went with a senior, Fitz McKinnon, in an effort to win some games and keep his job.   Last season, a new coach, Al Bagnoli, was skeptical and McGeehan did not start at first. The other day, Bagnoli said: \"A lot of his improvement came in the last couple of games last season. Our primary tailback was hurt and we had to go more with the pass. Jimmy stepped up. We've made some subtle changes in how we're throwing the ball and he's been comfortable and confident from the start.\"   McGeehan has twice played Princeton and is 0 for 2 in close games, losing, 20-14, last year and, 17-12, in 1991 when he had 47 pass attempts. \"Both times we just didn't get the job done,\" he said. \"Now here comes another chance.\"   EXTRA POINTS    In the Division I-AA weekly poll, conducted by The Sports Network, Princeton is ranked No. 16 and Penn No. 22. It is the first time in the history of the poll that two Ivy teams have been in the top 25 in the same week. . . . The last time Penn and Princeton met as unbeaten teams was 99 years ago. The Quakers had outscored nine opponents, 330-10, and Princeton its seven, 192-0. Penn won, 12-0. But Princeton leads this series, 59-24-1. . . . The last Princeton team to win its first seven games was the undefeated 1964 team.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"Pornography's Role : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/opinion/IHT-pornographys-role-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"The Professor Declares War on Free Speech\" (Opinion, Oct. 28): .George F.

They were: David Burnstine (later Bruce); Oswald Jacoby; Howard Schenken; Waldemar von Zedtwitz; P. Hal Sims; B. Jay Becker; Theodore Lightner; Richard Frey; Michael Gottlieb, and Sam Fry Jr. All played much of their bridge in New York City, although Becker was from Philadelphia and Jacoby migrated to Dallas. Most lived to be octogenarians, but all are now dead.   One of the last links to this cluster of stars was severed Sunday when Mabel Frey, Richard's widow, died peacefully in her sleep in her Manhattan home at the age of 88. Bridge was a major part of her life from first to last. On the diagramed deal, played almost three years ago in a Chicago game at the Cavendish Club, now no more, she held the South cards. After her partner opened one heart, she charged ahead with Blackwood. A Tempting Save    The final contract of seven hearts would have been a lay-down, but East saved in seven spades. This action would be less tempting today, for since the beginning of this year the laws of social bridge conform to duplicate and nonvulnerable penalties for defeats of four tricks or more are heavier. In this case the save was due to cost 1300, since the defense scores a diamond ruff. Today it would cost 1700, still profitable since seven hearts would be worth 2210.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"Packwood Case Shows Women Speaking Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/opinion/l-packwood-case-shows-women-speaking-up-397093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I am surprised and troubled to find that a man so clever in his use of words and in the understanding of the English language as William Safire has permitted himself the lazy luxury of popular vitriol.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931104","headline":"THE 1993 ELECTIONS: Virginia; A G.O.P.

In addition to \"Dreams and Shadows\" at the National Academy of Design (review on page C31), there are several group shows, large and small, all of which offer seldom-encountered work.   Two of the exhibitions are at the Metropolitan itself. \"Master Drawings of the Hudson River School\" is a selection of some three dozen works on paper. In broad outlines, the history of American landscape painting is here in a nutshell, from its sleepy topographic beginnings to Thomas Cole's romantic \"Fountain\" (1843), as atmospheric as an opera set. In the tenderly rendered tree studies of Jervis McEntee one finds the blend of pragmatism and poetry that defined the American landscape at its best, a mixture also evident in the work of Frederic Edwin Church.

At its core, the Clinton plan would create a web of regional \"health alliances\" to pool the purchasing power of consumers and negotiate on their behalf for lower prices for health insurance. The Clinton system would not necessarily produce new costs -- indeed it is intended to operate more efficiently than what Americans have now -- but it will almost certainly reshuffle the deck in who has to pay the costs of medical care. Sharing Cities' Burdens    The states, not Washington, are to create these new purchasing pools and decide their boundaries.

The Celtics, still reeling from the death of Reggie Lewis this past July 27, are in danger of suffering their first losing season since 1978-79, the last time they failed to make the playoffs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Diner's Journal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/arts/diner-s-journal.html","abstract":"  New Places in Old    In the lean atmosphere of the 90's, new restaurants are often retreads, old places recycled instead of elaborate new constructions.
