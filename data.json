Did He not say, having created woman from Adam's rib, that \"therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\"? The singleness of flesh is itself a vivid metaphor for copulation. The organic world is soaked in sex; Lucretius, in his epic \"On the Nature of Things,\" begins by saluting Venus: \"Yea, through seas and mountains and tearing rivers and the leafy haunts of birds and verdant plains thou dost strike fond love into the hearts of all, and makest them in hot desire to renew the stock of their races, each after his own kind.\"\n\nVenus alone, in the rousing translation by Cyril Bailey, is \"pilot to the nature of things\" -- without her aid nothing \"comes forth into the bright coasts of light, nor waxes glad nor lovely.\" Two millenniums after Lucretius and his fellow Latin celebrants of all-powerful love, Freud and his followers have reconfirmed the helplessly sexual nature of humankind and have announced the harmfulness, not to say the futility, of sexual repression. How strangely on modern ears falls the notion that lust -- sexual desire that wells up in us as involuntarily as saliva -- in itself is wicked! With what nervous hilarity did we greet Jimmy Carter's famous confession: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\" Mr. Carter was running for President at the time; his opponent, the incumbent Gerald Ford, was a more typical post-Freudian man.

The optical lesson is that a modest amount of substantive achievement can overcome a whole lot of stylistic failure.

The same taxi driver who insists en route from the airport that there's no better place in the world is the first to curse the sprawling, smog-smothered city. While Athens can be a disappointment, a tangle of cement and wires, congested streets with few reminders of its illustrious past, the patient, open-minded traveler can discover its charms.   The secret is to search for the city's pockets of beauty, its moments of greatness and its idiosyncrasies. One way to do this is to stroll the neighborhoods, from the elegant suburb of Kifissia to working-class Piraeus. Athens is still the megalo horio, the big village. Sit at a ritzy cafe in the Kolonaki quarter: on your left is the hurdy-gurdy player who talks about the civil war as though it were yesterday; on your right, a patrician mother enjoying a frappe with her transvestite son in full gear. Pass a designer boutique in the suburb of Maroussi; a rooster crows from the whitewashed house next door. The nightclubs may resemble those in any other European capital, but after midnight, rock and roll, rap and hip hop give way to the wails of Greek love songs.

It was his first visit to this beguiling sweep of water speckled with 365 oddly shaped islands amid the bleak mountains and boglands of County Mayo. The sun was just setting as the carriage bearing the author-to-be of \"Barry Lyndon\" and \"Vanity Fair\" rounded Croagh Patrick and rumbled along the coast road on into Westport: \"The mountains were tumbled about in a thousand fantastic ways and . . . the bay . . . which sweeps down to the sea, and a hundred islands in it, were dressed up in gold, and purple, and crimson, with the whole cloudy west in a flame. Wonderful, wonderful!\"   In the 150 years since Thackeray -- who was usually more prone to satire than hyperbole -- published his sharply observant travel narrative \"The Irish Sketchbook,\" little has changed along the shores of Clew Bay. A paved road now winds among the villages and resorts along the north-facing coast, spilling out onto the pier at Roonagh Quay, meandering inland through the pub-lined main street of Louisburgh, and skirting the swatch of brilliant white sand against the bay's dark aqua at Old Head Beach. Just to the east, the mottled green and black slopes of Croagh Patrick loom above the ancient path that in pre-Christian times brought crowds of pilgrims to the mountain's base for a festival honoring the Celtic god Lug, long before St. Patrick and his followers spread the new faith to the West of Ireland.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Getting Parents More Involved In Educating Their Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/nyregion/getting-parents-more-involved-in-educating-their-children.html","abstract":"AS the classroom day drew to a close recently at the Morris Street Elementary School in Danbury, Karen Miller's kindergarten was the scene of controlled chaos. Twenty children scrambled for their backpacks, grabbed a last-minute snack of green grapes and lined up at the door. But Ms. Miller's duties did not end when she walked her boisterous charges to the lobby. Fifteen minutes later, she had an appointment across the street for a parent-teacher conference at Ashley Harvey's house.\n\nThe girl's parents, Robert and Jo Harvey, ushered Ms. Miller into their living room, where Ashley settled into her mother's lap on the sofa. The adults discussed Ashley's anxiety about leaving her mother in the morning, her growing interest in spelling and her readiness for first grade. Before leaving, Ms. Miller read Ashley the story \"City Mouse, Country Mouse.\" Such visits are not unusual for Ms. Miller and two other kindergarten teachers at Morris Street. They are participating in an innovative program in the Danbury schools that aims to increase parental involvement, as well as providing more full-day kindergartens and preventing older students from dropping out. Over the last nine months, Ms. Miller has visited all her students' homes at least once. Sometimes she brings an interpreter; many parents are immigrants from the Dominican Republic, South America and Asia. Although most students walk to the neighborhood school, parents seem happier to meet the teacher on their own turf. \"School doesn't seem to have happy memories for them,\" Ms. Miller said.\n\n Last year, after being designated by the General Assembly as one of 12 urban priority districts, Danbury received $1 million from the state for the current school year, to try to reduce the number of students who drop out. The other priority districts are Bridgeport, Hartford, Meriden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, Norwalk, Norwich, Stamford, Waterbury and Windham. The state program manager, Carol Chapin, said that the districts were given a total of $10 million for 1992-93, and that legislators budgeted $11 million for 1993-94. District officials were required to develop three-year programs, with grants to be determined annually. \n\nPreviously, the choice of priority districts was based on test scores and the number of children from families on welfare. In Danbury, only one child in nine comes from a welfare home. But the new rules automatically included the state's eight largest cities, based on the 1990 census. Smaller districts are eligible for aid if they have large numbers of children from families on welfare.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Human Greed Holds the Reins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/sports/l-human-greed-holds-the-reins-566093.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   It took me years to recover from the tragedy of the Ruffian-Foolish Pleasure race, but with the Belmont, I have watched my last race.

Although it collected a sheaf of admiring notices in the spring of 1963 -- \"a bonbon of a musical,\" cooed The Times -- and ran for more than 300 performances, it never recouped its investment. By Broadway's unforgiving yardstick, that makes you a failure in the record books.   I don't know anybody who thinks of the show that way. It's my experience that anybody who thinks at all fondly about past musicals feels passionately about \"She Loves Me\" and yearns for a revival.

Siena?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/arts/art-view-giving-voice-to-the-renaissance-in-siena-siena.html","abstract":"  Sculptor, painter, architect, engineer, theorist and, in general, \"homme extraordinaire,\" Francesco di Giorgio can lay claim to the dubious honor of being the most undervalued artist of the 15th century. Sit through a course on the Renaissance and chances are his name will not be mentioned: he was a nova in that constellation of Italian artists that held all Europe in thrall. The problem is that he was born a Sienese, and as all visitors to that Tuscan city know, Siena and its artists are synonymous with the Middle Ages. Writing on the occasion of a visit in 1873, Henry James remarked that \"other places perhaps may treat you to as drowsy an odor of antiquity, but few exhale it from so large an area.\"   The means of rectifying this neglect has been provided in the form of a lucidly conceived exhibition, \"Francesco di Giorgio and the Sienese Renaissance: 1450-1500,\" on view here through July 31 in the church of Sant' Agostino. The exhibition, which includes 120 paintings, sculpture, drawings and manuscript illuminations, is as rich and multifaceted as the personalities it features. Foremost among these is the great Florentine sculptor Donatello, who spent the years 1457 to '59 in Siena; Francesco's mentor, the sculptor-painter Vecchietta; his associate Nerroccio de' Landi; and the North Italian miniaturists Girolamo da Cremona and Liberale da Verona, who were called upon to illuminate the choirbooks of the cathedral.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"The Perps Are Almost Always Male","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/books/the-perps-are-almost-always-male.html","abstract":"MEN, WOMEN, AND AGGRESSION\nBy Anne Campbell.\n196 pp. New York: \nBasic Books. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Murder Trial in Beating by Detroit Officers Begins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/murder-trial-in-beating-by-detroit-officers-begins.html","abstract":"  A jury that took two painstaking weeks to assemble will have to decide whether the fatal beating of a black motorist was a wild exercise of raw power by the police or the action of committed officers confronted by a struggling man in a high-crime area.

When the gentle Anglican vicar of Winslough dies from eating hemlock root in a meal prepared by a woman who knows her herbs, the gossips have a field day spreading nasty rumors of murder throughout the country parish. The herbalist grows sullen and secretive; the unstable constable who is her lover gets mean and ugly; the woman's 13-year-old daughter acts out sexually; and the local witches fire up their caldrons.

SUMMER'S STORY (Knopf, $17), a seemingly sprightly fable of childhood adventure and discovery by the German novelist Patrick Suskind, whose malevolent first novel, \"Perfume,\" was an international best seller. Unlike most coming-of-age stories, this one explores not only the mysteries of duty and desire, injustice, aging and death -- but also Galileo's laws of falling bodies. Set in a pleasant lakeside village \"shortly after the war,\" the tale is narrated by a nameless boy who loves his typically incomprehensible parents, dotes on his elusive sweetheart and despises his hilariously cranky piano teacher. Gravity (and perhaps gravitas) enters the life of this child \"so light I could fly\" in the form of the mysterious Mr. Summer, an eccentric recluse who spends all his time ferociously striding about the countryside, and whose single utterance is an angry \"Why can't you just leave me in peace!\" Like a force of nature, Mr. Summer pulls the airy narrator down to earth, providing sobering lessons about childhood foibles and grown-up fears. And if the translation by John E. Woods occasionally provides a few thuds of its own (\"They were only dreams, and like all dreams not really emotionally satisfying\"), the accompanying drawings by Jean-Jacques Sempe have the ethereal quality of innocence just on the brink of being lost.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"A Wrong Message For Young People?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/style/l-a-wrong-message-for-young-people-582293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Are you encouraging your readers to get stoned?

However, no matter how the tax is calculated, it would increase the cost of every manufactured item without exception and raise the cost of living substantially.

Depicted in architect's renderings with sunlight streaming through its sparkling glass skin, the arch brings out the primal emotions aroused by the sight of a rainbow after a storm. It may be years before this vision materializes. The $315 million needed to build it is not yet in hand. But Amtrak's proposal to resurrect Pennsylvania Station from a pit beneath Madison Square Garden and enshrine it within the landmark general post office building across the street has aroused more anticipation than any civic project in years.   No wonder, for this project pushes some of the hottest buttons in architecture and urbanism today. Public space. Infrastructure. Mass transit. Regional planning. But the hottest button of all is one that touches off a painful memory: the destruction of the original Pennsylvania Station station 30 years ago. The razing of this station, McKim, Mead & White's 1910 masterpiece of Beaux-Arts design, was one of the greatest traumas New York City ever suffered. Public reaction was profound, and in some ways beneficial. Historical preservation was transformed from a genteel pastime to a nationwide movement with political clout. Architects began to admit that the Modern movement was turning out to be less than a boon for cities. Above all, New Yorkers began to assert a proprietary interest in the city as their collective cultural heritage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"From Bosnian Crisis To All-Out War","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/opinion/from-bosnian-crisis-to-all-out-war.html","abstract":"  The horror in Bosnia will not reach a natural equilibrium at which the fighting will stop.

If, by chance, it was already taken, I walked from car to car until I found a similar seat -- usually with success. Having marked my turf by piling casebooks and notebooks on my lap and on the adjoining seat, I immediately went to work, praying that no one would be desperate enough to want a cramped seat with no window.   At each stop I pretended to be engrossed in my reading, hoping that my intense concentration would discourage even the bravest of commuters from interrupting me and asking that I remove 10 pounds of lawbooks from the seat. Yes, I was selfish. But we're talking law school here. Survival of the fittest.   After graduation from law school, I commuted all summer to a bar exam review course in Manhattan -- again, in my windowless corner seat. I was able to get two of the seven hours of daily studying done before I even got home.   After passing the bar exam, my commuting days ended. But I think fondly of my windowless corner seat, and wonder what desperate souls now covet its graffiti-covered upholstery. Thank you Metro-North. I couldn't have done it without you.

Nearby, Sheldon Harnick was beaming at his wife's 16 watercolors now hanging in the C.F.M. Gallery on Greene Street in SoHo, her first extensive collection to be seen in New York City. Two Long Island exhibitions -- \"more abstract and adventurous,\" Mrs. Harnick said -- are to open, one on Aug. 7 at the Benton Gallery in Southampton and the other on Aug. 21 at the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton.   On a Wednesday afternoon two weeks ago Mr. Harnick was also edgy. The next night, \"She Loves Me,\" the 1963 musical, was to open in a new production on Broadway. Two days later he felt bolstered by the sterling reviews that just might transform from cult to hit status a romantic musical set in a Budapest parfumerie in 1934.    Not that the lyricist of \"Fiorello,\" which had opened four years earlier, and \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" one year later, needs bolstering, but after 30 years it is nice to know that a favorite show's time has come.  Benefit Performance Saturday    Mrs. Harnick, an artist in ascent, and Mr. Harnick, who divide their time between an apartment on Central Park West and a house in East Hampton, will appear in \"A Broadway Medley -- Hampton Style,\" one of 16 events next weekend on the South Fork to benefit Guild Hall in East Hampton.    In their hourlong performance at the house of Lillian Braude in East Hampton, the couple will include two selections from \"She Loves Me\" and two outtakes from \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" \"Dear Sweet Sewing Machine\" and \"The Butcher's Song.\" Their act is an outgrowth of a joint appearance at Rainbow and Stars in Manhattan several years ago.   \"That was a nice detour,\" Mr. Harnick recalled. \"But Margery needed to get back to art, and I wanted to go on writing.\"    Mr. Harnick's numerous works in progress include a 45-minute cantata, a full-scale version of \"Cyrano\" and a musical fantasy adapted from a Russian play.    \"Sheldon's a good director,\" Mrs. Harnick said. \"He knows the essentials he wants from the act.\"  Former Broadway Performer    Once a Broadway performer under the name of Margery Gray, she worked in two of Mr. Harnick's shows with scores by Jerry Bock, \"Tenderloin\" and \"Fiorello.\" \"But we weren't going out together then,\" she said. \"We were married after 'Fiddler.' \"   And then Ms. Gray appeared in, among others, \"Tovarich,\" as the ingenue in the musical starring Vivien Leigh; \"Drat, the Cat,\" as standby for Leslie Ann Warren, and opposite Hal Linden in a revival of \"Anything Goes,\" but no longer in Mr. Harnick's shows. \"Casts can be sensitive,\" she said, \"and we didn't want it to seem like nepotism. So we kept our work apart.\"    After their marriage -- her second and his third -- Mr. Harnick said: \"I respected Margery too much to say, 'I hope you give this up.' But I was delighted when she decided she wanted to be home, not rehearsing, or on the road.\"    They have a son, Matthew, a marine biologist in his 20's who lives in the Hamptons, and a daughter, Beth, from Mrs. Harnick's previous marriage. She is a songwriter in her 30's and lives in Los Angeles.   As a wife and mother who sometimes performed on commercials and voice-overs, Mrs. Harnick tried photography. Mary Rodgers and Tom Paxton, two neighbors in the Hamptons, bought her work, \"but that wasn't hands-on enough,\" she said. Awaiting the \"You're On\" Call    \"I grew up with a respect for art, and it was something to do in the dressing room while I was waiting to go on stage,\" Mrs. Harnick recalled. \"My mother, Mildred Gray, was a fashion designer. She painted, and she's still at it at 88. While other kids had coloring books, she gave us drawing pads and unchewed pencils.\"    Musing on her creative beginnings, Mrs. Harnick said:   \"All those years dancing in front of multimirrors in a rehearsal hall I was fascinated with the reflections' going out into space, the color play between light and people. I didn't realize that would grow into an obsession, and after I had done a piece of art, what an incredible revelation that I composed it, I lit it, I choreographed it. I did it all myself.   \"My work is about nature -- wind, sunsets, things floating in water. People see different things in them, whatever they want it to be, but I know where I'm going before I put it together. It's as if the paper, paper so thin it's translucent when the light comes in, were the paint.\"    Mrs. Harnick uses paper made of papyrus, carrots, Japanese rice, eggplant from South America and bark from trees in California. \"Beth sends those,\" she said.    On the harmony between greasepaint and watercolors in their lives, Mrs. Harnick said:   \"We have a station wagon to constantly schlep canvases from New York to East Hampton. I have my own identity, and we do a lot of benefits. We get to rehearse together and laugh. It's the best of both worlds.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"A Village in the Palm of One's Hand","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/books/a-village-in-the-palm-of-ones-hand.html","abstract":"OBABAKOAK\nBy Bernardo Atxaga.\nTranslated by Margaret Jull Costa.\n326 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living in: Morningside Heights","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/realestate/if-youre-thinking-of-living-in-morningside-heights.html","abstract":"IN a public relations move at the turn of the century, Morningside Heights was named \"The Acropolis on the Hill.\" The name has stuck, at least among guidebook writers and the neighborhood's present enthusiasts.\n\n Then, as now, educational, spiritual and medical institutions dominated the neighborhood, occupying about half the land; one institution -- Columbia University -- owns another quarter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Chekhov in a Lifelike Setting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/nyregion/theater-chekhov-in-a-lifelike-setting.html","abstract":"  BEHOLD an esthetically correct \"Cherry Orchard.\" In the Rushmore mansion at Woodbury in Orange County the audience regards Chekhov's powerless elite through an arched doorway, on a sprawling lawn and in a grand ballroom.

If the paper is strippable, entire sheets should be removable by this method.    Underneath may be a layer of backing paper.

But another 35 to 40 party members, who led the rebellion that forced a no-confidence vote against Mr. Miyazawa through Parliament on Friday, is expected to announce later this week that it is also forming a rival party.

The idea that a doomsday rock did in the dinosaurs was first proposed in 1980 by Dr. Walter Alvarez, a geologist at the University of California at Berkeley.

The vote in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council was 8 to 1. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the dissent. FROM THE DECISION By Justice Stevens    The President has directed the Coast Guard to intercept vessels illegally transporting passengers from Haiti to the United States and to return those passengers to Haiti without first determining whether they may qualify as refugees. The question presented in this case is whether such forced repatriation, \"authorized to be undertaken only beyond the territorial sea of the United States,\" violates Sections 243(h)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (I.N.A. or Act). We hold that neither Sections 243(h) nor Article 33 of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees applies to action taken by the Coast Guard on the high seas.                    . . .         Aliens residing illegally in the United States are subject to deportation after a formal hearing. Aliens arriving at the border, or those who are temporarily paroled into the country, are subject to an exclusion hearing, the less formal process by which they, too, may eventually be removed from the United States. In either a deportation or exclusion proceeding the alien may seek asylum as a political refugee for whom removal to a particular country may threaten his life or freedom. Requests that the Attorney General grant asylum or withhold deportation to a particular country are typically, but not necessarily, advanced as parallel claims in either a deportation or an exclusion proceeding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930622","headline":"Kate Reid Memorial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/arts/kate-reid-memorial.html","abstract":"  A memorial service for the actress Kate Reid is to be held next Tuesday at 11 A.M. at St. Clement's Church Theater, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton.
