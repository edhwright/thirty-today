Playing one rousing song after another, belting choruses until they were red in the face and pounding on their instruments to accentuate every backbeat, the twins Craig and Charlie Reid put on a performance that was as much a sporting event as a music concert. With a four-member backing band, the Scottish brothers conjured up the ghosts of 1950's doo-wop, soul and rhythm-and-blues but substituted muscle and adrenaline for emotion and ache.   The Proclaimers might have been over and done with after they released two well-received albums in the 1980's, but when a four-year-old song of theirs, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles),\" was revived for the film \"Benny and Joon\" last year, these latter-day Everly Brothers returned. Their most recent album, \"Hit the Highway\" (Chrysalis/ERG), crammed with songs about love, religion and family, certainly justifies their comeback.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/c-corrections-825387.html","abstract":"  An article and a picture caption yesterday about a rent dispute at a Manhattan apartment building, the Belnord, misspelled the surname of a tenant.

Preliminary 1994 figures show a further decline: car thefts were down 15 percent in the city and 13 percent in New York State in the first six months of 1994 from the first six months of 1993. Law-enforcement officials credit increased enforcement efforts, the proliferation of alarms and other anti-theft devices, and the growing use of identification numbers on cars and parts as reasons for the drop in auto theft. Bridgeport and Newark have even higher rates of car theft per 100,000 residents than New York City, though reported theft in each of those cities declined more than 20 percent in 1993 from 1992.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"1919:Wet Prohibitionist : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/opinion/IHT-1919wet-prohibitionist-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] The second public appearance of W.E.

They performed a sema, the Sufi ritual of spiritual rebirth, before a sold-out house on Friday night at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. It was a spectacle: six men dressed in white with tall camel-hair hats, with arms outstretched and long skirts twirling, accompanied by music that slowly gathered momentum, from stately extended melodies to more vigorous, more rhythmic tunes.    The white costumes represent death shrouds; the hats, tombstones. In the mystical Islam that was taught by Jalal ad-Din Rumi, sometimes known as Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273), the spinning dancers are a link between earthly existence and rapturous divine love. There was no chaos, no abandon in their ecstasy. As they whirled, the dervishes proceeded in a circle around the stage, comparable to orbiting planets, while their dancing master strolled among them. They never lost direction, collided or showed dizziness when they stopped for ceremonial bows. Yet unlike twirling ballet dancers, they moved their heads along with their bodies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"At 633 License Suspensions, The Top Scofflaw Is Arrested","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/at-633-license-suspensions-the-top-scofflaw-is-arrested.html","abstract":"  He called himself Bobby Leonard or Harvey Linen, Leroy Linden or something else, and he used various addresses, real and unreal, the police said.

Presumably the idea was that much music that did not literally use traditional tonal harmony created its tensions and resolutions with large, vaguer areas of harmonic force. Albert may have written his Second Symphony as an example. It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and received its premiere during the weekend's series of subscription concerts conducted by Hugh Wolff. Albert completed a short score before his death, indicating about half the instrumentation; a colleague, Sebastian Currier, felt very little else was required and orchestrated the piece based on his knowledge of Albert's style.   Much of Albert's previous music was inspired by literary texts, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Riverrun\" (1984). The Second Symphony, though, is a piece of absolute, abstract music. Its three movements last about a half-hour, during which there are identifiable key regions. The third -- a familiar interval in tonal music -- gives the work much of its coloration. There are even, here and there, tonal melodies that echo late Romanticism. The work is full of allusions to earlier styles, including both Mahler (in the sarcastic-sounding second movement) and Copland (in the elegiac passages of the last). The label neo-Romantic was often applied to Albert; this piece deserves to be called his Neo-Romantic Symphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/c-corrections-825328.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about a surge in the Chiron Corporation's stock price misstated the stock's trading activity on Thursday in some copies.

Mr. Deng's death, this theory goes, could lead to a period of instability reminiscent of the palace coup in 1976 that resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of the Gang of Four.\n\nSuch a comparison is tempting but flawed. Mr. Deng is not Chairman Mao. He shares power with a handful of octogenarians -- some in robust health -- and he often needs to compromise on key policy and personnel issues.

For the 1990's, the popular trappings include a buffer of guitars -- often distorted or discordant -- and lyrics that fracture or ignore the romantic verities of older pop. Mere melody can seem too sweet, not tough enough; fierce guitars and booming drums eliminate any wimpiness. On Saturday night at Roseland, Sugar, Velocity Girl and Magnapop were a triple bill of kindred bands, shielding tender feelings in muscular, noisy rock, skipping lead-guitar solos to get to the next riff or accusation.   Bob Mould, who leads Sugar, helped invent the style with Husker Du in the 1980's. After an interlude as a solo performer, using gentler arrangements, he returned to the power-trio lineup with Sugar.

It seized power in what used to be known as Burma by massacring democracy demonstrators in the streets of Rangoon six years ago. Since then it has ignored elections, cooperated with drug lords and waged a relentless war against democratic political leaders, university students, Buddhist religious activists and the ethnic minorities who make up more than a third of Myanmar's population.    This grim dictatorship is now being courted by countries eager for new economic opportunities in the world's hottest boom region. These include many of Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors and much of the European Union. To the east, Thailand makes refugees fleeing the Slorc's repression feel unwelcome. To the north, China provides military aid, consumer goods and diplomatic support. The U.S. stands almost alone in principled opposition to the Slorc, denying it anti-narcotics aid and development assistance, blocking loans from international banks and criticizing it in international forums.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Bosnian Army Fights to Hold Areas Taken From Serbs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/world/bosnian-army-fights-to-hold-areas-taken-from-serbs.html","abstract":"  Fighting continued today in northwestern Bosnia as Muslim-led Government forces battled to maintain their hold on territory captured from Bosnian Serb forces and endured artillery attacks from Serbs in Croatia.

There are basic, unresolved questions about the editing of his manuscripts, the chronology of his output, the validity of his recollections. And a more essential mystery shrouds his process of creation. At an Ives-centered festival presented by the Brooklyn Philharmonic last weekend, a member of the audience asked, \"How did you do it?\" The question was directed at the composer John Adams, who had orchestrated several Ives songs, but one wanted to ask it of Ives himself. How, from a chaos of secondhand material, does great music arise?   The weekend's events at the Brooklyn Academy of Music offered many fascinating insights into Ives, although it also created some new confusions. The theme was \"American Transcendentalists,\" tracing the powerful connection between Ives and the school of 19th-century idealist philosophy centered in Concord, Mass. There was a rich spread of Ives works: \"Three Places in New England,\" \"The Unanswered Question,\" various songs and shorter pieces and, naturally, the \"Concord\" Sonata. In and among them, the actor Donald Moffat read aloud selections from Emerson and Thoreau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"The Rise of a Self-Proclaimed Phenomenon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-of-a-self-proclaimed-phenomenon.html","abstract":"  VAMPS AND TRAMPS  By Camille Paglia  532 pages.

His pained, honeyed voice, with its bluesy turns and its countryish ache, fills every line with sincerity; his unhurried, deadpan delivery gives every line the air of an intimate confession. He uses his Large Band, including horns, strings and backup singers, to add small touches of down-home Americana like gospel harmonies or a Western-swing fiddle solo; it's a virtuosic group that always defers to its leader. While Mr. Lovett always comes across as sympathetic and convincing, his songs leave it up to listeners to decide what's really going on. Sometimes his narrators are genuinely affectionate or heartbroken; sometimes they're the weirdos who appear in \"Creeps Like Me.\"    At Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday night, in the first of two shows, Mr. Lovett played a generous, leisurely concert, 2 hours and 40 minutes long. For its first part, he lavished attention on songs that weren't always worth it: material from his latest, and least, album, \"I Love Everybody\" (Curb/MCA). Mr. Lovett is at the highest plateau of his career so far, after building a dedicated following and then extending his name recognition by marrying the actress Julia Roberts. But to make \"I Love Everybody,\" he dipped into his archive of early songs, and many of them are juvenalia: clever and trivial, built on one-liners (\"Penguins are so sensitive to my needs\") or easy ironies. \"Fat Babies,\" Mr. Lovett explained, was written to embarrass anyone who sang along; the audience enthusiastically joined in.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"Decking the Screen With Lots of Savers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/science/peripherals-decking-the-screen-with-lots-of-savers.html","abstract":"  DEAR Santa,    For Christmas I would like a 21-inch SVGA monitor and a one-gigabyte hard disk drive in a Pentium with 32 megs of RAM.

But far fewer fish than made the trip just a few years ago are being recorded these days by the video camera trained constantly on a narrow underwater passage through which all migrating salmon must pass to get around Gold Ray Dam.   Lately, annual runs of wild coho on the Rogue as they head for their natal waters on tributaries upstream have been about 80 percent below average. Federal officials are expected to announce soon whether they will declare the coho an endangered species throughout much of the Pacific Northwest. Fisheries biologists say, in fact, that most strains of Pacific salmon -- as valued a totem in this region as the bald eagle is in the nation at large -- are in deep trouble as a result of overfishing at sea, natural climatic factors and destruction of freshwater habitat where the big fish spawn and where their progeny grow large enough to return to the ocean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"Political Depression Hits Brunch Belt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/nyregion/political-depression-hits-brunch-belt.html","abstract":"  What did you think of the election?

Tournament   The National Collegiate Athletic Association awarded berths yesterday to 32 teams for the Division I tournament, which will start on campuses this week and conclude with the final four Dec. 9-11 at Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.   In keeping with tradition, the N.C.A.A. divided the country into eight regions for the tournament. But it reduced the minimum number of teams in each region from two to one to make room for more at-large berths.   Virginia (17-3-1) is in quest of its fourth consecutive national title and it appears that the Cavaliers are playing their best right now. Seeded second in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament that was staged over three days at Clemson, the Cavaliers captured the tournament with victories over Wake Forest, Duke and Clemson.   North Carolina-Greensboro (17-4-0) will be Virginia's opponent in the first round, which also includes four other teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference, proof that the conference is the strongest in the country.   North Carolina State (13-6-0), Duke (14-6-1), North Carolina (13-6-0) and Maryland (13-5-1) are also in the tournament, whose first round must be completed by Sunday.   St. John's (14-4-3) earned the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Big East tournament by capturing the tournament for the third consecutive year. This time, the Red Storm did it with a 1-0 triumph over Georgetown on a goal by Huey Ferguson with just under five minutes left.   Georgetown (18-3-0) was the regular-season winner in the Big East for the first time and was awarded its first tournament bid. The Hoyas were the most improved team in the league.   \"The league is getting stronger every year,\" said Dave Masur, the coach at St. John's, who took over the Red Storm three years ago and made it into a powerhouse. \"We've had 5 teams ranked in the top 20 in the country.\"   While St. John's will visit Rutgers, Georgetown will play Maryland. Georgetown was ranked 9th and St. John's 10th in the coaches' final regular-season poll, which has the first nine positions unchanged from the previous week.   Rutgers (11-4-3) is in the tournament as a result of winning the Atlantic 10 and then beating Loyola (Md.), the winner of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.   Boston University (18-0-1) finished atop the coaches' national ranking for the end of the regular season as the only undefeated team in the country. The Terriers ended the regular season with a 3-2 triumph over New Hampshire and will meet Harvard.   Harvard (5-8-2) is in the tournament because of the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Ivy League, where Brown finished with an overall record of 11-3-1. The victory over Hartwick earned Brown a bid, and the Bears will play host to New Hampshire (15-4-2) in the first round.   Indiana (19-2-0) was seeded first in the tournament and will play host to Notre Dame (12-9-2). Indiana took the Big Ten tournament with victories over Wisconsin and Penn State, who both made the tournament.   Wisconsin (14-5-0) will play at Southern Methodist (14-3-1), while Penn State (15-5-1) will meet Robert Morris (15-6-1) in a rematch from last year.   San Francisco (9-6-3) is in the tournament for the 26th time thanks to the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the West Coast Conference. The Dons, who have captured the national title four times, the last time in 1980, appeared to be out of it this season, after winning only twice in their first eight games, but they have lost only once in their last 10 games.   San Francisco will play Fresno State (17-2-1), while San Diego (13-5-0) will be at Fullerton State (12-6-2) in another West Coast match.   In other matches around the country, St. Louis (16-5-0) will play Creighton (14-4-1), Alabama-Birmingham (15-3-1) will play U.C.L.A. (15-4-0) and North Carolina-Charlotte (16-3-0) will play host to Charleston (17-6-0). Women's Division I   North Carolina is a step closer to its 12th overall title , and ninth consecutive N.C.A.A. national title. The Tar Heels reached the semifinals again with a 3-1 victory over Duke, the team that ended their undefeated streak at 101 games last month.   Connecticut (19-3-0) will provide the opposition for the Tar Heels (23-1-1) in the semifinals, which will be staged Friday at the University of Portland (Ore.). The Huskies reached the final four with tournament victories over Brown and Hartford.   Notre Dame (21-0-1), the only undefeated team in the country, will play Portland (16-5-0) in the other semifinal to decide Sunday's finalists for the championship.   Notre Dame reached the final four for the first time in its history with victories over George Mason and William and Mary, while Portland advanced by eliminating St. Mary's and Stanford.

The prosecutor showed that while Mr. Clausell could precisely remember a mundane scene at a mall -- a tall black man getting out of a Lexus and greeting two white teen-agers standing next to a Jeep -- he could not remember the name of his last employer, the jobs he had held for years at a time, or that he had twice pleaded guilty to charges of selling drugs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"Sides Break Bread; No Answers on Table","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/sports/hockey-notebook-sides-break-bread-no-answers-on-table.html","abstract":"  As the bitter National Hockey League lockout lurches through its seventh week, the canceled games are replaced by personal dinner meetings, big boardroom sessions and telephone conference calls.

The Steelers used a battering defense that harried Bills' quarterback Jim Kelly, who was sacked six times, jarred the ball loose from receivers and rendered Buffalo's offense completely ineffective. - Then, that same defense became a spectacular scoring machine with two great individual plays by cornerback Rod Woodson which resulted in two Steeler touchdowns. It even came up with a blocked field goal when defensive end Brentson Bruckner deflected a 32-yard attempt by Bills kicker Steve Christie with 13 minutes 54 seconds to play.   The result was a 23-10 victory for Pittsburgh (7-3), which remains a game behind Cleveland (8-2) in the American Football Conference's Central Division. The loss dropped the Bills to 5-5 and jeopardized their playoff hopes.   Kelly finished with 22 completions in 43 attempts for 212 yards. He threw one touchdown pass, but was intercepted twice.   Woodson scored on a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter. In the third quarter, he jarred the ball loose from Kelly on a sack for an eight-yard loss. The ball bounced around in the end zone and defensive end Gerald Williams fell on it for a touchdown that helped make it 23-10.   For its part, the Steelers' offense served as nothing more than a distraction until the defense could come back on the field. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Steelers offense had converted just 1 of 11 third-down attempts.   Entering the game, the Bills were in an unfamiliar position of fighting for a playoff berth. The last time they were at .500 this late in the season was in 1987. They are tied with the Jets in the A.F.C. East, two games behind the Dolphins. The Steelers, meanwhile, remain one game behind the first-place Browns (8-2) in the Central.   In the first half the Bills certainly didn't play like the team that had dominated the American Football Conference landscape the last four seasons. Sometimes they resembled that team when they switched out of the two-back set they have deployed in the last few games into their no-huddle attack with three wide receivers -- a staple the last four years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"DANCE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/arts/in-performance-dance-832677.html","abstract":"  Painters and Gertrude Stein Provide the Inspiration  Merce Cunningham Studio    Rachel Thorne Germond choreographically reaffirmed the fun of dancing in \"Splendor Again,\" one of the works she presented on Saturday night.

Manley, who was banned from the N.F.L. for violating the league's drug policy, was arrested Sunday night and was released Monday after posting $5,000 bail. Yesterday, he made an initial appearance in court with his lawyer, PAULA ASHER, who said, \"He is anxious to get this matter resolved.\" A Dec. 6 arraignment has been scheduled.   Manley, 36, failed the fourth drug test of his career in December 1991. The defensive end later attempted a comeback, bouncing around the N.F.L. and the Canadian Football League. He played for the C.F.L. Shreveport Pirates earlier this season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941116","headline":"IN PERFORMANCE: THEATER","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/16/theater/in-performance-theater-844314.html","abstract":"  A Candid Self-Portrait Of a Drag Queen in Mufti  Dixon Place    The most amusing riff in \"My Tiny Life,\" a self-portrait written and performed by Mark F.

So what a pleasure it was on Monday night in Carnegie Hall to hear the gold medalist of the ninth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, and to feel that this was the New York debut of a musician rather than a pianist -- not a fully formed musician, perhaps, but a fascinating musician nonetheless. The Italian pianist Simone Pedroni was 24 when he won the contest in 1993, and is the highest-ranking veteran of the Cliburn wars to play in New York in recent months; Frederic Chiu appeared in the spring, Armen Babakhanyan gave a debut concert a few weeks ago that received critical plaudits, and Fabio Bidini, who played here last February, will give a recital at Tully Hall in December.
