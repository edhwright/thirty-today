When it fell on this installment of the Balanchine Celebration, it was 1941. Yet because George Balanchine kept tinkering with productions, none of the three works presented was precisely what audiences saw back then.    \"Slaughter on 10th Avenue\" is a snippet from \"On Your Toes,\" the musical hit that Balanchine choreographed in 1936. Possibly because of the enduring popularity of its score by Richard Rodgers, Balanchine restaged \"Slaughter\" for the City Ballet in 1968. Seen apart from its musical-comedy context, this comic melodrama seems an awkwardly constructed fragment from a longer entity. But it does offer opportunities for effective characterizations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930508","headline":"Sid Fernandez Goes on D.L.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/08/sports/baseball-sid-fernandez-goes-on-dl.html","abstract":"  Left-handed pitcher Sid Fernandez has been placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to May 1 with a small cartilage tear in his right knee, the Mets said yesterday.

To the faithful, Ms. Simone's visits are not just concerts but ceremonial reunions at which \"the high priestess of soul\" returns from a self-imposed exile to bless her flock and to refresh her own sense of self-worth. During one especially boisterous round of acclaim at the Beacon, she stoked the applause by gesturing for more and demanding: \"Feed me!  Feed me! I need it!\"    The ceremony would be ludicrous were Ms. Simone not an astonishingly dramatic performer. When she feels comfortable and appreciated, as she did at the Beacon, she can take a familiar song and virtually reinvent it, sometimes by interpolating her own lyrics, to turn it into an intense, often troubling personal journey. The drama comes from the volatile mix of Ms. Simone's deep, rumbling voice, her elegant classical pianism and her mercurial temperament. A brooding ballad can suddenly explode with anger. An exultant cry of delight can just as suddenly crack with pain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930508","headline":"Gowanus Expressway Should Be Demolished, Not Rebuilt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/08/opinion/l-gowanus-expressway-should-be-demolished-not-rebuilt-571893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I have been following with interest and dismay the public discussion on Brooklyn's Gowanus Expressway reconstruction.

The opera, in English with full orchestra, will be performed at the Lehman Center Theater. The company has long been known for its inventive stagings and impressive casts, mostly drawn from the ranks of young singers. For ticket or other information, the number to call is (212) 408-1661.   Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase, has started a 10-year plan to produce Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas with first-rate soloists, full orchestra, and a professional chorus. The first production will take place on Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. Half of the program will be devoted to a potpourri of songs and choruses and the other half to a complete, staged edition of \"Trial by Jury.\"    The company includes such internationally known artists as Spiro Malas (who starred recently on Broadway in \"The Most Happy Fella\"), Ann Howard of the English National Opera and Eric Roberts, a member since 1988 of the New D'Oyly Carte Company in London.

Now the chorale will present Handel's \"Samson,\" first performed in 1743. The music director, Daniel Paget, is approximating the proportions of the original performance, using about 50 voices and a Baroque-style orchestra, with David Bender, Katherine Johnson, Lisa Monheit, Stephen Bryant and David Shapero as soloists. The concert is scheduled next Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Sommer Center on the Bronxville campus of Concordia College. For more details, the numbers to call are 965-1679 or 969-5786.

Asimov, who died a year ago at the age of 72, published more than 450 books in his lifetime, most of them nonfiction. He was one of the great explainers of his day. Like a missionary sworn to spread the gospel of reason to the unenlightened, he helped introduce an entire generation to the insights of modern science, writing lucidly about everything from the mysteries of matter and energy to the mysteries of the human mind. While he occasionally dabbled in subjects outside his chosen field -- the Bible, say, or the works of William Shakespeare -- he took his self-imposed burden seriously.   No one knew better than Asimov how quickly books about science become obsolete. Even those written from a historical perspective have a relatively short half-life. Twice between 1964 and 1982, Asimov updated his comprehensive Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, revising and adding hundreds of entries; the 1982 edition offered a sampling of \"The Lives and Achievements of 1,510 Great Scientists From Ancient Times to the Present Chronologically Arranged.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Democracy's Obsolete Secrets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/opinion/democracy-s-obsolete-secrets.html","abstract":"  President Clinton has ordered a sweeping review of government secrecy now that the cold war is over.

Its emergency room treats more than 39,000 cases a year.\n\nDr. Glantz, 37, had the right qualifications, of course, but it was also his easygoing nature and sensitive and jovial bedside manner that he extends to co-workers, as well as patients, that made him boss of the E.R.  Dr. Glantz entered the field 10 years ago, when physicians in emergency rooms were still the Rodney Dangerfields of medicine. They got little, or no, respect not only from other physicians, but also from the public. \n\nBut the field was already changing from one populated by many residents, semiretired doctors and those not able to succeed in their chosen fields to high-quality board-certified physicians trained in emergency medicine. E.R.'s were moving from being subsections with little authority to full departments with real power.\n\n\"While I still get asked sometimes when I'm getting a real job,\" said Dr. Glantz, who works 10-to-12-hour shifts three of every six days, \"this has become one of the hottest residencies now.\" \n\n\"We're no longer low man on the totem pole,\" he said. \"It is also one field where doctors don't have to wear beepers or be on call. And I get plenty of vacation, six weeks a year.\"\n\nDr. Glantz had originally wanted to be a surgeon, but he grew to love the action, variety and times when seconds count and the adrenalin surges in emergency medicine. \"I wouldn't do anything else,\" said Dr. Glantz, whose face is lightly freckled and whose brown hair is beginning to gray. \"I don't know how private doctors do it. I'd be bored to tears.\" \n\nIn emergency medicine, doctors have to know something about everything, he said. In one day he might have to treat a head injury, stabilize a heart-attack victim, set broken bones and deliver a baby on a car seat.\n\n\"But every time I get cocky enough to think I can handle everything,\" Dr. Glantz said, \"something comes through the door that we don't understand. It keeps me studying.\"\n\nDr. Glantz's days vary dramatically. Sometimes, business is slow, and just a few of the 22 beds are occupied. \n'We're Very Superstitious' \n\n Sometimes the ambulances never stop arriving. Like that cold winter night in 1990, when an Avianca jet crashed a few miles west of the hospital, sending a stream of ambulances carrying 11 trauma victims, five of them children. Or when the Walt Whitman Mall fire in 1991 sent to the hospital 22 smoke-inhalation victims and one burn victim, who later died.\n\n\"We're very superstitious,\" Dr. Glantz said. \"We follow the moon. Actually, Mondays after holidays are usually bad, and summer is worse than winter, because weekend warriors are some of our best business. And beer and lawn mowers are a terrible combination. We had a guy in here who ran over his foot with one. He had a Meisterbrau in one hand and a lawn mower in the other. True story.\" \n\nThree women arrived in the emergency room in one month, each complaining of unspecified abdominal pain and each in labor. \"One of the women even had other children,\" Dr. Glantz recalled. \"Now that's real denial, when you are in labor and don't even know you're pregnant.\"\n\nOn a recent Monday, which was slow, Dr. Glantz was tending a man who had a grand mal seizure at a friend's house and was taken by ambulance. The man, who had a history of seizures, was using medication to control them, but had forgotten to take it that morning or even for a few days. It was difficult for Dr. Glantz to get a straight story. He hears lies daily, he said, but he does not grow angry, because patients usually lie out of embarrassment.\n\nHuntington Hospital does not treat the same populations as many urban hospitals, but the community has changed dramatically in 20 years.\n\n\"Long Island is no longer a bedroom community, where everyone is a homeowner with a two-car garage and 2.4 kids,\" said Dr. Glantz, who grew up in Rosedale and earned his B.S. in chemistry at the State University at Stony Brook in 1977. \"Now we have the Saturday night knife-and-gun club. We get slashings and knifings and shootings. Not as much as Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, but we get our fair share, if there is such a thing as a fair share.\"\n\nJust after noon on that Monday, a young man accompanied his 12-year-old cousin, who had an earache. After a quick look at the boy's ears and throat, Dr. Glantz found the problem.  The right ear was bright red, a sure sign of an infection. Dr. Glantz told the boy about the eardrops and bubble-gum-tasting antibiotic that he would prescribe and shook his hand, but he gave no hint to the youth or his cousin that children's ear infections belong in a pediatrician's office, not in an emergency room.\n\nDr. Glantz was well aware that the boy, like an increasing number of people in the region, is in the Medicaid program. In the Huntington region, he said, there are virtually no physicians who treat Medicaid patients, because of the paperwork.\n\n\"The nearest clinic that takes Medicaid is pretty far away, in Wyandanch,\" he said. \"And they are so swamped that this boy probably would not have been given an appointment until next week. Others have no health insurance at all. We're the safety net here. No one is turned away, which is one of the beauties of emergency medicine. I can treat everyone equally, from the homeless to someone from Lloyd Harbor who pulls up in a Rolls- Royce.\"\n\nSuddenly a mother carrying a baby who was bleeding from the head rushed in. The woman explained that her car had skidded in Dix Hills and hit a tree. The windows on the driver's side shattered, and the baby, Jake, was in his car seat at the time.  \"Well, that's good,\" Dr. Glantz said. \"Now let's take a look at him.\" \n\nAs the mother let go, Jake began to cry. A nurse took off his diaper, which had glass shards in it. The mother winced and kissed the baby, who was five days away from his 1st birthday. She, too, started to cry. \"He may have just been hit by some flying glass,\" Dr. Glantz said. \"And that would be good.\" \n\nHe held a pen in front of Jake's face and told him to watch the rocket ship.  \"See it come out of mommy's ear,\" he said, as he checked the baby's pupils to see whether his brain was functioning properly. \"Kids respond better when I act like a silly uncle.\"\n\nAn hour later Dr. Glantz was looking at X-rays of Jake's head and chest. \"Looks good,\" he said. \"Now I get to reassure the mom. That's what I like to do.\" Her son needed several stitches. But before Dr. Glantz could sew the cuts on Jake's forehead he had to perform another operation, something that he called \"a parentectomy,\" or removing the parent from the room. \"I have always found that the child does better when the parent is not in the room,\" he said. \n\nWith a large bright light overhead, Dr. Glantz put Jake in a blue papoose, which the baby did not like. Jake began to cry. \"I'm sorry, Pumpkin,\" Dr. Glantz cooed. He injected a local anesthetic, checked for glass in the wounds and began stitching with a tiny curved needle. \"This is where the art of medicine comes in,\" he said, as he sewed nine tiny stitches across two small cuts. He cleaned the baby's head, which was red from numerous scrapes, and dabbed bacitracin on the area. \"So do you hate me?\" Dr. Glantz asked as he took Jake out of the papoose. Jake stopped crying.\n\n\"Now we're buddies?\" Dr. Glantz asked. \"Give me five! Two and a half?\" Dr. Glantz carried Jake to his mother, singing to him all the way.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Kristin Thompson, Christopher Bonacci","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/style/engagements-kristin-thompson-christopher-bonacci.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Richard L.

Even though her beautifully cropped hair is silver and her speech (but not her thinking) slowed somewhat by a stroke, the face is a smooth, Modigliani oval, the jaw clean and strong. Age and illness seem to have taken her back in time: at 88 she looks more like the young woman of Stieglitz's photographs than she did at 70, when Arnold Newman took her picture.    Stieglitz photographed Mrs. Norman repeatedly in the two decades before his death in 1946. They had met in 1926, in his small but influential domain, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue, where she was entranced by a John Marin exhibition. Although both were married and neither was interested in divorce, they gradually fell in love.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Talk and Dance At Spoleto","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/travel/travel-advisory-talk-and-dance-at-spoleto.html","abstract":"  Two new events will be included in this year's Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., which opens May 28.    \"Conversation With . . . ,\" a series of informal afternoon interviews at the Dock Street Theater, begins June 1 with Ginger Rogers, followed by dialogues with the choreographer Murray Louis on June 2, the novelist Josephine Humphreys on June 7 and Gian Carlo Menotti, the festival's founder, on June 8.

Not only is the Freer's great Asian collection back on view (300 of its finest objects) and reinstalled in a warmer, friendlier setting, but so is one of the most extravagant of 19th-century interiors, the Peacock Room designed by James McNeill Whistler -- now cleaned, conserved and utterly dazzling.   Though the Freer stands in the shadows of Washington's other renowned museums and has a reputation for being a somewhat forbidding place, it has always had its ardent fans. Historically, it has the distinction of being the first American public collection devoted primarily to the art of Asia, though its holdings are what make it unique. \"America Meets Asia,\" the working title for the reinstallation, says it all. Charles Lang Freer (1854-1919), the gallery's founder, collected both American and Asian art with equal fervor in the belief that all art springs from the same spiritual roots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Tet and Television","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/books/l-tet-and-television-372293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Picking a network television star to review a serious work of history is always risky.

And what have we received of late? The season ended last weekend with the twilight of Wagner's gods; some people talk about the Met as though it deserved a similar send-off. For all the triumph of the Wagner \"Ring\" performances, overall attendance dropped this season (to 89 percent of capacity, from 92 percent last season), and there was many a mundane evening (including the first performances of Rossini's \"Semiramide\" and Verdi's \"Ballo in Maschera\"). It would be easy to compile a damning list of callow tenors, worn sopranos, uneven casts, dull conductors, misjudged theatrics, neglected opportunities.   But the Met's track record this season was actually one that any company in the world might envy. It included the revival of a 1964 production of Verdi's \"Falstaff\" in a sterling performance that almost made it seem as if Paul Plishka, Marilyn Horne and Mirella Freni were part of a polished repertory company -- alert to one another and to the score. Otto Schenk's new production of Wagner's \"Meistersinger\" was suffused with good sense and exceptional ensemble work; its Nuremburg included Hermann Prey, Donald McIntyre and Karita Mattila. To my ears, \"Die Walkure\" was the musical standard-bearer for the Met \"Ring,\" and the Met orchestra played it nearly seamlessly. And all of these Verdi and Wagner performances were conducted with authoritative breadth and supple energy by James Levine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"Figuring the Cost of Car Rentals in Europe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/travel/practical-traveler-figuring-the-cost-of-car-rentals-in-europe.html","abstract":"  IF you think air fares are confusing, wait till you contemplate renting a car in Europe. Not only are there a multitude of variables to consider (type of transmission, mileage allowance, insurance coverage, taxes, car size and currency exchange), but there are also such questions as whether to make a reservation, whether to prepay, whether to pay a surcharge for the convenience of picking up the car at the airport and whether to choose longer-term leasing over short-term renting.   Even a survey of only three major rental companies with headquarters in the United States -- Avis, Hertz and National -- opens a can of worms. The companies were asked to supply details on the countries where a visitor to western Europe would be most likely to find the least-expensive economy cars for one week in the summer season and, for comparison, the cost of upgrading to the least-expensive car with automatic transmission. Only two of the three companies gave a breakdown of basic rates and rates with the collision-damage waiver (C.D.W.). Avis offered rates as an inclusive package with unlimited mileage, waiver and tax, or as an exclusive package with unlimited mileage only. All three offered unlimited mileage with a weekly rental; not all do for a one-day rental.  The C.D.W. Factor     As most people who have rented cars in the United States know, one complicating factor is the collision- damage waiver (C.D.W.), which is not actually true insurance. The car-rental companies are not selling a policy; they are collecting an extra fee for offering to forgive the cost of any damage. Like the basic car rental rates, the C.D.W. fee can be as much or as little as the traffic will bear.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"For Achievers, Young and Not So","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/style/evening-hours-for-achievers-young-and-not-so.html","abstract":"  Benefits honor leaders in the arts, fashion and social work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930509","headline":"2d Founder Died in Duel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/opinion/l-2d-founder-died-in-duel-393193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In the \"Memorial to Alexander Hamilton\" (April 24) there is an error.

Each work seemed to be propelled by a set of inner conflicts, by competing impulses pulling against each other.    In the case of Donald Martino's Set for Clarinet (1954), those impulses were the desire to draw on popular forms -- jazz and blues -- but to do so within a language of rigorous atonality, and to shine a spotlight on a clarinetist's virtuosity without losing sight of the work's compositional ingenuity. The thematic and harmonic simplicity of John Cage's Six Melodies for Violin and Piano (1950) disguises subtle complexities and elaboration. Elizabeth Brown's \"Memory Palace\" (1990), for flute, cello and piano, uses a tonally freewheeling language (neither strictly rooted nor fully atonal) and an abstract structure to paint a distinct, if fanciful, picture in which thematic relationships come increasingly into focus as the piece unfolds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"Marshak Memorial Service","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/us/marshak-memorial-service.html","abstract":"  City College will hold a memorial service for President Emeritus Robert Eugene Marshak at 3 P.M.

Even so, the script, which has been widely produced since its premiere in 1984, is clever and sometimes legitimately amusing. Mr. Matura is an elegant writer whose other plays can recall the novels of his fellow Trinidadian V. S. Naipaul in their ironic political undertow. Here he so faithfully and musically translates the rich Irish language of the original text into a lilting Caribbean patois that his verbal ingenuity recalls Richard Wilbur's stunning English translations of Moliere. For all the alterations, which include the transformation of a pub into a rum shop and of the Widow Quin into a superstitious folk priestess (Michele Shay), \"Playboy\" still tells of a young stranger, now called Ken (Victor Love) instead of Christy, who briefly earns the adoration of an impoverished town by confessing to having committed parricide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930510","headline":"The Papp and Festival Archives Go to New York Public Library","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/10/theater/the-papp-and-festival-archives-go-to-new-york-public-library.html","abstract":"  The archives of the New York Shakespeare Festival and the personal papers of its founder, Joseph Papp, believed to be the largest and most complete collection ever assembled of a postwar American theater organization, have been donated to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, the library has announced.
