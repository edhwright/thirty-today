Although historical records show Christus was a successful and wealthy painter, admitted to the highest circles of society, quite soon after his death toward the end of the century his art was all but forgotten. In the 1820's he was rediscovered, only to be brushed aside in this century by art historians like Max Friedlander and Erwin Panofsky as a weak hanger-on of van Eyck. PETRUS CHRISTUS: Renaissance Master of Bruges (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $60) teases out the obviously derivative elements of Christus's small oeuvre from his perhaps minor but nonetheless significant contributions to Renaissance Flemish panel painting. As Maryan W. Ainsworth, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows in her scholarly essay, Christus married his intimate knowledge of illumination techniques to the new medium of oil painting. His often diminutive, richly detailed panels shimmer with color. Ms. Ainsworth's painstaking examination of the artist's technique, aided by scientific analyses of the underpaintings, quite conclusively distinguishes Christus's slightly dreamy artistic sensibility from that of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get realism of van Eyck. However, in her zeal to restore Christus's status as an original artist, the author sometimes glosses over his obvious deficiencies -- Christus's portraits (which, although expertly executed, do tend to look alike) are described as \"consistent in their physiognomy.\" However, while the book sometimes plunges the layman deep into the arcane world of art conservation with its abstruse terminology, it does succeed in bringing to life not just the work of Christus, but also his richly adorned (and beautifully painted) world of the 15th century's wealthy and devout.\nSIRI HUNTOON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"DRIVING SMART;\nCleaner Starts for the Catalytic Converter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/automobiles/driving-smart-cleaner-starts-for-the-catalytic-converter.html","abstract":"AUTOMOTIVE engineers have long known that cars do their most serious polluting right after they are started, before their catalytic converters warm up.\n\n\"Three-quarters of hydrocarbon emissions come out of the tailpipe in the first two minutes,\" says Joe Kubsh, an engineer in Novi, Mich., for W.

A replacement league could be on the horizon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"Fare of the 50's: Italian, and Then Some","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/nyregion/good-eating-fare-of-the-50-s-italian-and-then-some.html","abstract":"  AMARCORD * (212) 935-3535; 7 East 59th Street; $$$; all major credit cards    The setting is stylish: wood accents, soft fabric and beautiful flowers, pictures of women's legs adorning the walls.

Book publishers whose primary income comes from games, textbooks and reference books might find new media of long-term interest, but others ought to remind themselves that complexity, subtlety, intellectual rigor and originality have a hard time clearing the economic hurdles of the marketplace -- if new media cost a lot to develop, each title will need a mass audience to make the undertaking viable.

It seems that Paul Tonna of Huntington Station and Nora Bredes of Stony Brook have become personal targets of the powerful cigarette lobbies, simply because they had the courage and foresight to initiate the recent law that bans smoking in most public restaurants. The bottom line is simply this: everyone has the right to breathe clean air, and all other rights are secondary to that of the common good. Ms. Bredes and Mr. Tonna recognized that and did the responsible thing and are now being punished for it. To attempt to harass and threaten these two is unconscionable, but par for the course when dealing with the villainous, unscrupulous monsters Philip Morris and the R. J.

One moment, Mr. Scaggs sounds like a raw Texan blues singer, then with a slight softening of tone he metamorphoses into a patrician San Franciscan pop crooner. The change from one thing into another isn't so much a matter of self-conscious role-playing as it is of allowing different facets of a many-layered musical personality to edge to the fore.    The singer, who performed at Town Hall in Manhattan with a five-member band and two backup vocalists on Saturday and Sunday, started out as a Texan blues-rock singer. He reached his peak of popularity in 1976 with a sophisticated pop-soul album, \"Silk Degrees,\" which had something of a disco ambiance. His best-loved songs include romantic ballads like \"Harbor Lights\" and \"We're All Alone\" in which his reedy, quirky pop baritone projects considerable tension and vulnerability. Although the music on his newest album, \"Some Change\" (Virgin), is tougher and more guitar-oriented than it is on his earlier records, the songs also have a brooding, introspective undertone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"Flawed Characters In the Public Eye, Past and Present","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/movies/flawed-characters-in-the-public-eye-past-and-present.html","abstract":"  Paul Attanasio was born in 1959, the same year the quiz show scandal on television stunned and outraged the nation.

That makes sense -- if the monitors can verify that the embargo is really being enforced. The U.N. imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia to get Belgrade to cut off the Bosnian Serbs.

On Saturday, the Fall was joined by Mr. Smith's ex-wife, Brix, who left the band in 1989 but rejoined it last month. Her sharp, simple bass and guitar lines funneled the band's diverse energies into hard-hitting post-punk.

The suicides, including two last Tuesday, have brought renewed attention to a long-smoldering problem on the police force: the depth of suspicion that troubled officers have for the department's array of counseling services. Most officers shun them for fear of jeopardizing their careers or out of a stubborn attitude that they should deal with their own ordeals. And many sergeants are loath to report tormented officers because they do not want to be looked upon as the heavy.

Congress is likely to limit the growth of Medicaid and Medicare as part of a health care bill. In New York state, where local governments help carry the burden of Medicaid costs, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and county leaders have lobbied heavily -- so far unsuccessfully -- for the state to take over these expenditures.

The accompaniment even seemed a bit charming. One didn't want to get too solemn about this work, which has more than its share of absurdities.

The opera was unfinished when the composer died unexpectedly in 1887 and was then cut, altered and completed by Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov. It still has no definitive edition because the original manuscripts have yet to be studied by contemporary scholars.

International Tournament in Novgorod, Russia. His defeat of his 19-year-old protege was the most imaginative game in the elite, double-round competition, which ended in late August.   It also gave Kasparov, a Russian, a point toward the total of 7-3, which was good for a first place tie with Vasily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. Kasparov led throughout, but when he drew his last three games, Ivanchuk overhauled him. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . W. . . . L. . . . D. . . . Pts. Kasparov . . . 4 . . . 0 . . . 6 . . . 7 Ivanchuk . . . 4 . . . 0 . . . 6 . . . 7 Kramnik . . . 3 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 Short . . . 0 . . . 2 . . . 8 . . . 4 Shirov . . . 1 . . . 3 . . . 6 . . . 4 Bareyev . . . 1 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3   This time Kasparov did not look as though he might have any ambivalent feelings toward the young grandmaster whose career he had done so much to further. He showered the hapless Kramnik, also of Russia, with a veritable cascade of fireworks.     The Pelikan Variation of the Sicilian Defense presents a dramatic confrontation in its chief lines: after 10 Bf6 Bf6 11 c3, Black has the bishop-pair as against White's occupation of the weak d5 square with his knight.   Once Kasparov had revealed his plans for a mating attack with 13 h4!?, Kramnik challenged the d5 knight with 13 . . . Ne7. He was, of course, aware that 14 Nf6 gf damages the black king position, but after 15 Qd2 Bb7 16 Bd3 d5, he counted on using his central pawn phalanx as a counterweapon.   On 17 ed Qd5 18 O-O-O!? e4 19 Be2, Kramnik could have prevented a white mating attack with 19 . . . Qd2 20 Rd2, but with three pawns stopping four black ones on the kingside, while the healthy white queenside pawn majority would eventually yield a powerful passed pawn, the endgame prospects would strongly favor Kasparov. By accepting the pawn sacrifice with 19 . . . Qa2, Kramnik banished endgame worries.   After 20 Qh6 Qe6 21 Nd4, Kramnik might have tried to keep his queen centralized with 21 . . . Qe5, but then 22 f4! ef 23 gf Ng6 24 Rdg1! Kh8 25 Kb1 Rg8 (25 . . . Qf4? loses a piece to 26 Rg6!) 26 Bd3 Nf8 27 Rg8 Kg8 28 Bh7! Nh7 29 Rg1 Ng5 30 hg f5 31 g6! is overwhelming for White.   On 21 . . . Qb6, Kasparov kept mobilizing with 22 Rh3 Kh8 23 Bg4!, which threatened 24 Bf5 Nf5 25 Nf5 Rg8 26 Rd6 followed by 27 Qf6, winning outright. After 23 . . . Rg8, Kasparov produced the fantastic 24 Ne6!, planning to crush 24 . . . fe by 25 Qf6 Rg7 26 Rd7 Re8 27 Rg3 Bc8 28 Re7 Re7 29 Qf8 Rg8 30 Qg8! Kg8 31 Be6 Kf8 32 Rg8 mate.   Moreover, taking the other sacrificed piece with 24 . . . Rg4 is smashed by 25 Ng5! Rg5 (25 . . . fg drops the queen to 26 Qb6) 26 hg Kg8 27 gf. And defense by 24 . . . Qf2 fails against 25 Rf3! Rg6 26 Qg6 Qb2 27 Kb2 Ng6 28 Rf6 fe 29 Be6, which gives White a winning ending.   Kramnik struggled nobly on with 24 . . . Rg6 25 Qf4 Re8 26 Rd6, but it would not have saved him to try 26 . . . Qa5 27 h5 Qa1 28 Kc2 Qa4 29 Kb1 Rg4 30 Qg4 Rg8 31 Rd8! fe 32 Rg8 Ng8 33 Rg3. In this same hypothetical line, 30 . . . fe 31 Qe6 e3 32 Qf6 Kg8 33 Rg3 Ng6 34 Rg6 hg 35 Qg6 Kf8 36 Qh6 Kf7 37 Qh7 would lead into 37 . . . Kf8 38 Rf6 mate.   Kramnik tried 26 . . . Nd5, but Kasparov fired another salvo with 27 h5! Kramnik could not play 27 . . . Rg4 because 28 Qg4 Rg8 29 Qg8 Kg8 30 Rg3 Kh8 31 Rd8! Qd8 32 Nd8 forces 32 . . . h6 to stop 33 Nf7 mate, after which 33 Nb7 puts Kasparov a rook ahead.   So he went ahead with 27 . . . Nf4 28 hg! Qd6 (28 . . . Nd3 is broken by 29 Rhd3! ed 30 gf) 29 Rh7 Kg8 30 gf Kh7 31 fe/Q Ne6, but after 32 Bf5! Kg7 33 Qg6 Kf8 34 Qf6 Ke8 35 Be6, Kramnik was a decisive pawn down and his king was in a wretched position.   He could not even reduce the pawns by 35 . . . e3 because 36 fe Bg2 37 Bf7 Kd7 38 Be8 Kc7 39 Qg7 Kd8 40 Bb5 Bf3 41 Ba4 just loses more material. Not that it affected the outcome of the game, but Kramnik blundered in time pressure with 35 . . . Qf8? and at once, seeing that 36 Bd7 wins his queen, he gave up without waiting for the move to be put on the board.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940913","headline":"Jury Selection in Tailhook Negligence Suit Begins in Nevada","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/13/us/jury-selection-in-tailhook-negligence-suit-begins-in-nevada.html","abstract":"  Jury selection began here today in a civil trial involving one of the most sordid and divisive episodes in the history of the United States Navy.

But lest their singing be dismissed as so much senseless muddle, researchers say the tamarins' vocal repertory of 38 distinct sounds is unusually sophisticated, even by primate standards.
