These are vital issues, especially in the absence of a cold war. Yet resistance remains, and Mr. Clinton will need to move quickly and forcefully to achieve either goal.    The 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty, the bulwark of U.S. efforts to stop the spread of nuclear arms, comes up for review in April. Signed by 168 nations, the treaty has helped keep nuclear power programs from being used to make arms and was a factor in persuading South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Ukraine to give up their nuclear arms or arms-making. It is essential that a substantial majority of countries vote to extend the treaty indefinitely. That outcome is in doubt, to judge from this week's meeting of signatory countries in New York.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950128","headline":"U.S. Exhibit On Bomber Is in Jeopardy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/us/us-exhibit-on-bomber-is-in-jeopardy.html","abstract":"  The Smithsonian Institution is expected to scale back or cancel an exhibit of the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan in World War II, Congressional and Clinton Administration officials said today.

It scotched pretty quickly any ideal of pure, disembodied music, floating free of instruments and performers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950128","headline":"United Suspends Cantona","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/sports/sports-people-soccer-united-suspends-cantona.html","abstract":"  Manchester United suspended ERIC CANTONA, the striker who was last season's Premier League player of the year, yesterday for kicking and punching a fan during a match on Wednesday.

I first read Angus Wilson when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the late 1950's. Nobody had recommended him: I found him for myself. \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\" had appeared in a Penguin paperback in 1958, and maybe this was the novel that introduced him to me -- or maybe it was a volume of short stories, or his first novel, \"Hemlock and After,\" also available in Penguin. However I came upon him, I rapidly read my way through all that was available, and began to wait eagerly for the next volume. I can remember to this day the sheer physical pleasure of sitting on the flat roof outside my tower room at Newnham College, in the warm sunlight, when I should have been studying for some examination or other, reading Angus Wilson instead and knowing myself to be in the company of a master. When I got to the end of \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes,\" I wanted to begin reading the book all over again. And I have since read it many times, and always wished it were longer.\n\nThe excitement of discovery had a subversive element. Cambridge in the 1950's was heavily dominated by F. R. Leavis and his Great Tradition: we were more advanced than Oxford, for we were permitted -- indeed enjoined -- to read and admire D. H. Lawrence. But there all curiosity ended. We were not allowed to read on. Leavis's critical presence was so powerful in the university that it killed all but the most stubborn literary talent: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes survived, but many more withered, or took a diversionary leap sideways into drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Only Doubt Endures","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/books/only-doubt-endures.html","abstract":"  DEATH IN ROME  By Wolfgang Koeppen.

The most recent example is Dick Armey's reference to Representative Barney Frank, who is openly homosexual, as \"Barney Fag.\" Mr. Armey is the House majority leader, and we would have to go back to the days of Earl Butz to find a parallel example of such common behavior by a high Federal official.   His explanation that this was a \"stumbled word\" instead of \"an intentional personal attack\" is not supported in any way by the tape recording of his interview. He spoke with clear intent to defame a worthy opponent. In place of true contrition, Mr. Armey used a ranting speech on the House floor to denounce reporters for refusing to suppress his disgraceful on-the-record remarks made to interviewers assembled by Mr. Armey's staff with the express purpose of taping his words for broadcast. Even those who argue that Newt Gingrich's mother was sandbagged into criticizing the First Lady cannot defend Mr. Armey.

The deal did not signal an appreciation of the record business by the studio head: Reprise -- even with Mr. Sinatra on its roster -- was a loser. Rather, Warner's studio had recently enjoyed a hit with \"Ocean's 11,\" a Las Vegas caper film featuring the singer and several of his \"rat pack\" buddies, and the purchase of the label was part of a broader deal to tie up Mr. Sinatra as an actor. Even if Reprise continued to lose money, it was a cheap way of assuring that Mr. Sinatra would make movies for the studio -- a potential gold mine for Warner Brothers.   The deal did prove a gold mine, but not because of Frank Sinatra. Reprise gave Warner Brothers the services of a man whose ultimate value to the company over 31 years would dwarf Mr. Sinatra's: Mo Ostin.    At 68, the balding, bespectacled and low-key Mr. Ostin looks more like the controller he is by training than the monumental cultural visionary and business tactician he has proved to be. He stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of Warner Brothers Records on Dec. 31 after losing an unusually public corporate power struggle. But long after the dust of his departure has settled, Mr. Ostin's contribution to the record business will endure. Under his direction, Warner Brothers was transformed from a small, struggling label into the world's largest record company and the financial engine that drove Steve Ross's Warner Communications. Most significant, however, was the way Mr. Ostin achieved the transformation: by embracing the rock underground of the 60's when other, more conservative labels were loath to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"How I Survived Off Off Broadway: One Man's Tale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/how-i-survived-off-off-broadway-one-man-s-tale.html","abstract":"  WHEN Aunt Chiche went for her checkbook, I thought I had it made.

But the Philadelphia-born Davis began as a member of the Ashcan School before evolving his own brand of Cubism, which might be called \"Cubism Lite.\" Marsh, who was born in Paris to American parents, studied European history at Yale but it was he who became the street-level chronicler of the American scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Plan to Spread Pain of Medicaid Cuts Draws Wide but Tempered Criticism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/plan-to-spread-pain-of-medicaid-cuts-draws-wide-but-tempered-criticism.html","abstract":"  Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey's proposal to cut Medicaid embraces a simple strategy: make deep cuts, but share the pain.   Ms. McCaughey has proposed cutting $1.2 billion, or 13 percent, from a Medicaid budget that has doubled since 1989. Advocates for patients say the reductions would force many older people who now receive care at home to move to costly nursing homes. Union officials say the plan would mean layoffs of hospital employees and low-wage nursing home attendants. And hospitals and nursing homes say it might force hospital closings and a decline in patient care, especially at poor institutions that depend heavily on Medicaid payments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"What Winter Mulch Really Accomplishes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/l-what-winter-mulch-really-accomplishes-508195.html","abstract":"  This is a reply to \"Mulch Early and Mulch Often\"  [ Letters, Dec. 18 ] .  I agree there are many horticultural old-wives' tales that have no significance in the modern garden. Unfortunately, the timing of the application of winter mulch is not one of them. There are good solid reasons for applying mulch after the first hard freeze. Your roses can distinguish between proper and improper mulching, which may show up in their performance next season.   Plant roots are found in approximately the top foot of soil for herbaceous plants and the top two feet for shrubs. The only reason for roots to grow lower is to find moisture, not for constant temperature. Mulch does not cause roots to grow deeper, but rather allows them to remain at their natural depth by retaining moisture in the upper levels of the soil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living In/Boerum Hill; Restoration in a Mixed Ethnic District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-living-boerum-hill-restoration-mixed-ethnic-district.html","abstract":"  FOR Michael Armstrong, a pioneering town house purchaser in the 60's, Boerum Hill was, when he first arrived, \"more than a conscious neighborhood, more like a state of mind.\"    \"We bought our house at 453 State Street in 1966, a 16-foot-wide four-floor rowhouse where we raised three kids,\" said Mr. Armstrong, spokesman for Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President. \"Before us, 30 people lived in this house.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"AIDS Patients in S.R.O.'s Will Not Be Relocated","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/l-aids-patients-in-sro-s-will-not-be-relocated-263095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The Jan. 22 article \"Pressured, City Quietly Cuts AIDS Patients in S.R.O.'s\" mischaracterizes the Giuliani Administration's plans to house people with AIDS in commercial S.R.O.'s in Manhattan Community Board 7.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Pasta and More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/good-eating-pasta-and-more.html","abstract":"  ALLA SERA ++ (212) 717-5131; 1481 First Avenue, near 77th Street; $; all major credit cards","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Southwestern Snap Moves Into Westport","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/dining-out-southwestern-snap-moves-into-westport.html","abstract":"  WITH the arrival of the Durango Grill, it looks as though Westport finally has a winner and permanent occupant for a hillside location near the railroad station well known for revolving-door tenants.

But operators and agents have found that this approach does not succeed, he said, because gay clients can be perfectly comfortable on a mainstream safari. At the other end of the spectrum, gay clients may not need a guided tour to an easygoing place like New Orleans or Key West. Tour content and assurances of acceptance in areas where gay couples may have been shunned are apparently better selling points.   The owners of Out & About, who say it has a circulation of 6,500, believe that much of the agent interest stems from a need to find loyal clients in hard times. \"Travel agents are delighted to find that this underserved community is so loyal,\" Mr. Kolber said. Out & About is published 10 times a year and a subscription costs $49 in the United States: 8 West 19th Street, Suite 401, New York, N.Y. 10011; (800) 929-2268 or (212) 645-6922.  Focus on 'Community'   When \"gay travel\" became heard in the mainstream world, probably about 1990, the term was presumed to include lesbians, or gay women. But some women began to feel invisible. All-women cruises are increasing, and Alaska is a prime destination.   Charlie Rounds, the new president of RSVP Travel Productions, which until now has aimed at gay men, said the company was offering three all-women cruises on Seaspirit, the company's 100-passenger vessel. One cruise, leaving Feb. 4 from St. Martin, calls at Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, St. Kitts and Nevis. Fares start at $995 in double occupancy. On April 30, the ship will embark on a seven-night cruise along the west coast of Costa Rica, with fares starting at $1,295 in double occupancy. Mr. Rounds said that a seven-night Alaska cruise, leaving July 8 from Juneau at the same fares as the Costa Rica cruise, was selling best and would probably sell out.    Even so, RSVP will not offer all-women or all-men cruises after this year. \"We will focus on community: all of us all the time,\" Mr. Rounds said. Taking his parents on the Seaspirit and seeing them treated royally by his fellow gay passengers, he said, taught him that diversity was the way to overcome prejudice. RSVP's trips are available only through travel agents. RSVP: 2800 University Avenue Southeast, Minneapolis, Minn. 55414; (800) 328-7787 or (612) 379-4697.   Meanwhile, Jan Cooper of Special Expeditions in New Jersey has scheduled a women's cruise in Alaska for July 30 to Aug. 6. Ms. Cooper said, \"We have been operating voyages in Alaska for over 13 years and this is a personal effort to bring women from all over the continental United States to meet with the women of Alaska.\" For this, Elfin Cove, a community run mostly by women because the men are out fishing, is a particular destination. The 70-passenger Sea Lion will sail from Sitka and return to Juneau. The fare, in double occupancy, ranges from $2,860 to $3,980. Special Expeditions: 123 South Avenue East, Westfield, N.J. 07090; (800) 348-2358 or (908) 654-0048.    Olivia Cruises and Resorts in Oakland, Calif., a company catering to lesbians, is offering a seven-night Alaska cruise departing from Seward, Alaska, or Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on June 21 aboard the Royal Cruise Line's Royal Odyssey, with a capacity of 750 passengers. Fares start at $1,595 in double occupancy. Other charter cruises offered by this company are aboard the Seabreeze in the Caribbean, departing April 9, and aboard the Regent Spirit, cruising the French and Italian Rivieras. The six-night fares in double occupancy start at $795 for the Caribbean and $1,895 for the Mediterranean. Since it began in 1990 as an offshoot of Olivia Records, the company has sold 16 charters, 3 in Club Med villages. Olivia: 4400 Market Street, Oakland, Calif. 94608; (800) 631-6277 or (510) 655-0364. Adventure Tours   Toto Tours of Chicago will operate 21 small-group adventure tours this year, having started with one in 1991. New trips include a 16-day yacht cruise of the Greek and Turkish islands, for men only, leaving Aug. 30; a trip to the Netherlands timed for the Queen's birthday at the end of April, which will include the ceremonies marking the liberation of the Netherlands in World War II, and a trip to New Zealand Feb. 15 to March 1, with an available extension to the Gay Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, the following week. Toto Tours: 1326 West Albion Avenue, 3W, Chicago, Ill. 60626; (312) 274-8686.   Pied Piper Travel in New York is in its fifth year of selling blocks of cabins on cruises to gay clients. This year it has three scheduled sailings on the Queen Elizabeth 2: April 27 for a trip from New York or Fort Lauderdale to Southhampton, England; May 15, a five-day cruise from New York to Bermuda and back, and July 3, a seven-day cruise from New York to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and back. The trans-Atlantic prices, which include return air fare, start at $1,696. Pied Piper: 330 West 42d Street, Suite 1601, New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 874-7312 or (212) 239-2412.   A new company is Our Family Abroad. It operated a short season of escorted tours in 1994. In 1995, it will offer 23, 11 of them in Europe. The tours are operated by Globus and are their standard trips, but they are kept separate from the others, according to Peter K. Schulze, Our Family Abroad's president. Specific brochures, maps and coupons are provided to his clients. He uses Globus escorts who have volunteered for his tours, he said, to avoid homophobic guides; they are given special training. The brochure says that the tours are \"discreet by design\" and the groups appear \"no different on the outside\" from the many others touring the world. Single-country tours of Costa Rica, Egypt, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal are offered, as well as multi-country tours. Our Family Abroad: 40 West 57th Street, Suite 430, New York, N.Y. 10019; (800) 999-5500 or (212) 459-1800.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"San Antonio","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/travel/l-san-antonio-197295.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: I had just returned from a conference in San Antonio when your article appeared.

For Eakins, photography was a tool for teaching, for visual record keeping and exploration, but not an end in itself. Especially when compared to his powerful paintings, most of Eakins's photographs are less than remarkable. However, the large number of female and male nudes among his more conventional photographic images -- portraits of family and friends, snapshots of outings, picturesque scenes and farm animals -- attests to the originality of his methods. Eakins loathed polish and, when possible, chose students, friends, even himself for nude models to capture the awkwardness of real life.

The secret is never mentioned by the characters whose lives it threatens to ruin. Having no name, it can't be spoken even on a dare. Instead, it's always referred to indirectly, and with a kind of puzzled Christian innocence that denies the secret's corrosive effects. Mr. Foote's characters say that everything's all right, but he knows better.   After \"Talking Pictures\" and \"Night Seasons,\" the Signature Theater Company continues its season devoted to the playwright with a first-rate production of a work that will haunt you long after the performance. \"The Young Man From Atlanta\" is both quintessential Horton Foote and, in terms of subtext, one of his least characteristic works.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Neo-Fascists Remodel Their Party in Italy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/world/neo-fascists-remodel-their-party-in-italy.html","abstract":"  In the final hour of Italy's neo-Fascist party, which died here this weekend to make way for a more moderate successor, a wave of emotion swept through the delegates to a party congress.

Sir Michael Rose, whose one-year tenure as U.N. commander in Bosnia ended last week, had a thankless assignment. He was supposed to protect civilians in Bosnia's besieged cities, but had neither the mandate nor the means to repulse their Serbian besiegers. In theory, the U.N. is neutral between aggressors and victims in Bosnia's dirty war.   Even allowing for the toughness of the job, General Rose damaged the U.N.'s credibility. His efforts to avoid confrontation and protect his troops went beyond the narrow dictates of neutrality. He began well enough last January, cooperating with NATO efforts to get the Serbs to pull back artillery from the hills surrounding Sarajevo. But when the Serbs shifted their attention to Gorazde, General Rose impeded effective NATO air strikes. Later, he seemed to encourage Serbian military operations around Sarajevo's airport. Most recently, at Bihac, he seemed to ignore the Security Council's instructions to protect civilians.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Clinton Tests Cooler Congressional Waters on Raising the Minimum Wage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/us/clinton-tests-cooler-congressional-waters-on-raising-the-minimum-wage.html","abstract":"  After a month of trial balloons and uncertainty within the Administration over how best to push for a higher minimum wage, this much has become clear: the White House is still grappling with the question of how best to act in a new political world dominated by a Republican Congress.

After that, he was not certain about taking Mr. Greeley to New York, where Lasix and other medications are outlawed.

In a concert performance by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, this tale of a hapless, disturbed soldier beaten down by poverty, sleeping in sordid barracks, earning pennies by subjecting himself to perverse medical experiments and by submissively shaving the beard of a pompous military officer -- this tale of the archetypal modern victim -- actually became hauntingly lovely. Its horrific exclamations, sickly dances and unnerving juxtapositions were not distressing but fascinating; its characters almost seemed to take on abstract roles in a large-scale symphony.    The cast for this unusual exploration of the score was one of the best that can currently be assembled. The singers would have blossomed in a different direction in conventional operatic settings, but here they gave an esthetic polish to the jagged drama. Hildegard Behrens's singing as Marie, the soldier's mistress, was unblemished by the intermittent difficulties that have plagued her during recent seasons; in fact, her voice seems to have passed through a refiner's fire.

Gov. George E. Pataki wants to deny parole to violent felons and change New York's sentencing system so it would impose fixed flat sentences instead of minimum and maximum terms. And last week he signed an executive order barring violent felons from work-release programs. The Governor hopes to avoid the need for more prison space by loosening laws that require jail time for low-level drug dealers. Connecticut abolished parole completely in the early 80's but brought it back because of prison overcrowding and fiscal difficulties. According to the New York State Division of Parole, it costs about a tenth as much to supervise a person on parole as to house that person in prison. Graphs show the number of parolees to parole officers, the number of parole violations in 1993, the parole budgets in New York and New Jersey, and the cost of supervision in N.Y., N.J. and Conn.

The most common type is known as sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin found in red blood cells. This leads to the red blood cells adopting an abnormal sickle-like shape under certain circumstances; with this shape, they are unable to deform as they pass through capillaries, causing blockages. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain in joints, anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, dizziness and stroke. The probability of severe symptoms, including long-term pain, increases with age. Without treatment, people with SCD rarely reach adulthood but with good healthcare, median life expectancy is between 58 and 66 years. All of the major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver, heart, kidneys, gallbladder, eyes, bones, and joints can be damaged from the abnormal functions of the sickle cells and their inability to effectively flow through the small blood
