But there was no letup at the Chinese sports pavilion recently where 17-year-old Chen Lu leaped into her 20th triple jump at an afternoon practice session.   Chen is one of China's youngest female sports stars. National champion at 12, she is the first Chinese figure skater to place in international competition and is China's best hope to take its first medal in figure skating at the Winter Olympics that begin Saturday in Norway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940210","headline":"Rona Is Allowed to Return as Agent","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/sports/baseball-notebook-rona-is-allowed-to-return-as-agent.html","abstract":"  A former adversary of the baseball players union has won the right -- for the second time -- to represent players as an agent.

After rolling up an 11-point first-quarter lead, then an 18-point halftime lead, the Knicks (34-13) blew past the 76ers (20-27) in the fourth quarter on the way to a 114-79 victory at the Spectrum.

It is an understandable assumption, given the current spate of Schnittke performances: the world premiere of his Symphony No. 7 tonight by the New York Philharmonic, the American premieres last week of his Piano Sonata No. 2 by Boris Berman and his Symphony No. 6 by the National Symphony Orchestra, and a forthcoming performance of his \"Faust Cantata\" by the American Symphony Orchestra. Other recent works are being rushed to recordings. Not since Britten has a living composer been given this kind of attention.   But the man who sat patiently through an interview at the Watergate Hotel in Washington on Saturday morning has nothing to do with the world of trends. Soft-spoken, shy and physically frail from two recent strokes, this Russian-born composer is incapable of self-promotion. Unlike many composers before him, he does not conduct, and he has written perplexingly little for his own instrument, the piano.

The \"Frontline\" program recounted how the South African diamond cartel conspired with advertisers to maintain high prices by creating the illusion that diamonds were rare. \"Packaging the New,\" which opened this week at the Cooper-Hewitt, traces the history of an esthetic cartel -- industrial design -- and the mythology devised by designers to enlarge the market for furnishings, appliances and other household goods.   Focusing on the work of six noted American designers, the show traces a 50-year period beginning in the mid-1920's, when industrial design became an organized profession, and culminating in the mid-1970's, when the oil crisis and environmental degradation prompted widespread disillusion with the industrial juggernaut. Donald Deskey, Russel Wright, Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, Walter Dorwin Teague and Henry Dreyfuss: those were the cream of the industrial-design profession. They set a machine-age stamp on everything from cocktail shakers to detergent boxes, airplanes to prefabricated housing, fabrics to World's Fair previews of an utterly transformed world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940211","headline":"Match of Wits Over Jurors For a Senator","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/us/match-of-wits-over-jurors-for-a-senator.html","abstract":"  On one side of the courtroom: United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, listening raptly and smiling occasionally as jury selection in her ethics trial entered its fourth day today.

The Brewers scheduled a news conference for this morning, saying that their team leader would announce his retirement at that time.

But these days the foundation is under scrutiny from many quarters for the way it conducted itself, from the actual fund raising to the way the money was spent. Of $9.7 million collected through direct mail between September 1992 and December 1993, none went to purchase toys, although some toys were bought with corporate donations, said Lieut. Gen. Matthew T. Cooper, a retired Marine commander who was appointed president and chief executive of the foundation last fall. \"It all went to pay the expenses of direct mail,\" he said.  Holes in the Bookkeeping    In April the chairman and president, Jerry L. King, was dismissed after board members discovered he had been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, all unrelated to his foundation work.

Two years ago in a poll of PGA players published in The New York Times, Purtzer was voted the player with the best swing in golf.

To avoid pain while swinging, he changed his motion.

One prominent example is the fate of the alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who turned his back on more adventurous jazz in the early 1960's. He continues to make recordings that, as he puts it, bought him a house: music deep in the popular blues tradition. But he has suffered at the hands of critics. Mr. Donaldson, who is as fine a be-bop saxophonist as exists, is rarely considered a master.   He is performing with a group that includes Lonnie Smith on organ, Peter Bernstein on guitar and Ben Riley on drums. In two performances last week (on Feb. 1 and 3) Mr. Donaldson made the be-bop language pliable, delivering a small sampling of Charlie Parker's innovations with a soft tone and lyricism. Like Parker, he rarely took more than a few choruses, but a lot happened within those few choruses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940212","headline":"U.S. and Allies Send More Planes for Possible Strikes in Bosnia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/world/conflict-balkans-us-allies-send-more-planes-for-possible-strikes-bosnia.html","abstract":"  British and French aircraft carriers headed for the Adriatic today, and the United States prepared to send more fighter bombers to bases in Italy as NATO formally began the countdown on its demand that Bosnia's Serbs lift their siege of Sarajevo within 10 days, military officials said.

A superb English chorus of 10, directed by Peter Philips, the Scholars came fresh from performing this program on the actual death date, Feb. 2, in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, where Palestrina was trained and worked.

Such craftsmanship calls for musical expertise and something beyond technique: remembering that the best songs are made to touch listeners, not to impress.   Ivan Lins is one of those songwriters. Mr. Lins, a major star in Brazil who has lately recorded in English, takes after Milton Nascimento both in musical specifics -- a baritone voice that rises to a yearning falsetto, a gift for ballads and a broad palette of local Brazilian rhythms -- and in the general benevolence that radiates from his songs.
