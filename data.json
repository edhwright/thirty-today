Here! Now!,\" says the white man to the black man in \"Playland,\" the new drama written and directed by Athol Fugard. \"Forgive me or kill me. That's the only choice you've got.\"   With those few sentences, Mr. Fugard not only delivers the crux of his play at the Manhattan Theater Club Stage II but also sums up the crisis in South Africa now that apartheid is finally crumbling. In \"Playland,\" as in so much of his canon, this great writer boils down his country's tragedy to the simplest theatrical essentials: a couple of actors, a barren setting, a single confrontation, one act. It's a welcome return to solid artistic ground for Mr. Fugard after the groping of such recent efforts as \"My Children!

In August 1978, at the urging of a cousin, Stewart L. Udall went to Alamo and listened to mothers tell of the dust and radiation from the blasts that settled over the town in the 1950's and of the children they had lost to leukemia.   \"Until then, there were a lot of people in that country who suspected a link, but they kept it to themselves,\" said Mr. Udall, who once was Secretary of the Interior for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. \"They had been fed a steady diet of lies by the Government that there was no danger.

WITH: Estelle Parsons.   In his plays, Franz Xaver Kroetz takes the most banal of situations and transforms them into strange and haunting theatrical cameos. Slices of life become glimpses into private rituals of despair. In \"Extended Forecast,\" an elderly widow prepares to move to a home for the aged, trying to decide which of her possessions she will take with her. This is the text of the play but not the sum of the experience. As performed by Estelle Parsons at La Mama, the monodrama is stark, simple and poignant in its details.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930609","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/09/nyregion/c-corrections-204193.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Saturday with a theater review of \"Sheila's Day\" misidentified the actress shown.

The score was 3-0 and the loser was St. Joseph by the Sea, a Staten Island school playing its first title game.   Soto, a senior left-hander, walked none, struck out eight and stayed cool despite three errors and a passed ball by his teammates, raising his season mark to 9-0. The victory gave McClancy a 21-4 record and dropped St. Joseph by the Sea, a former all-girls school, to 17-12. In his first year at McClancy, Soto was a member of the city championship freshman team. As a sophomore, he was on the varsity when McClancy beat Brooklyn's Xavierian at Yankee Stadium. As a junior last year, he watched the Crusaders lose the title game to Fordham Prep.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930609","headline":"WHITE HOUSE PICKS ENVOYS TO 3 LANDS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/09/world/white-house-picks-envoys-to-3-lands.html","abstract":"  The White House plans to break the logjam that has delayed the appointment of ambassadors to several major countries, an Administration official said tonight.

Victor Herbert's Second Cello Concerto and Samuel Barber's Second Essay for Orchestra had their world premieres at Philharmonic concerts in 1894 and 1942, and the orchestra gave Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique its first American performance in 1866, 36 years after its world premiere in Paris.    James DePreist conducted the orchestra with mixed but generally pleasing results. His account of the Barber, though on the brisk side, was a picture of lucidity. Details that are usually obscured -- fleeting brass effects, inner wind lines -- were spotlighted without being given an unnatural prominence. And the solo woodwind lines that weave through the essay, and also the Berlioz, were shapely and characterful and did double duty in elucidating the essay's charms and reminding listeners of one of the Philharmonic's strengths.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930610","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/style/chronicle-756693.html","abstract":"  It takes a measure of flexibility to cater a dinner for 1,200 people.

Sting was smart to return to mid-size theaters like the 5,605-seat Paramount for his current tour (although he's also opening some stadium shows for the Grateful Dead), because the music he's making now moves too fast and too subtly for most arena concerts. He writes and sings pop songs, but in concert they're laced with jazzy improvisation, transforming them between the lines of catchy choruses and rolling grooves. For all of Sting's associations with causes, and the earnest moping of many of his lyrics, he has rarely been a preachy performer in concert. And on Tuesday, Sting the musician was triumphant.   While Sting's bands, including the Police, have never been content to play songs by rote, his current group takes on all challenges, from odd meters and harmonic substitutions to the openness and understatement of a ballad. Sting's own bass was both foundation and fulcrum for a nimble four-piece band including Dominic Miller on guitar, David Sancious on keyboards and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums. They don't have the jazz pedigrees of his first post-Police group, but they mesh gleefully and they know which gambits belong where.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930610","headline":"Japan Is Represented by an Artist It Once Rejected","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/arts/japan-is-represented-by-an-artist-it-once-rejected.html","abstract":"  The last time Yayoi Kusama displayed her art at the Venice Biennale was 1966.

Rock's most lapidary songwriters are willing to trade a show of spontaneity for a show of precision and whimsy, demonstrating just how elaborate a song can be.   Jellyfish, a band from San Francisco that performed on Friday night at the Academy, proudly joins pop's lineage of tuneful tricksters. Its songs cheerfully invite listeners to spot the derivations: the bouncy chords from Squeeze, the falsetto voice over rumbling drums from the Beach Boys, the vocal-harmony glissandos from Queen, the arrangements from the Beatles's \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" Its verbal strategies are close to those of Squeeze; songs from Jellyfish's two albums, \"Bellybutton\" and \"Spilt Milk\" (both on Charisma , used big words and fragmented narratives to address topics like the resemblance of rock fan clubs to televangelists' fund-raising (\"Joining a Fan Club\"), getting away with betrayal (\"All Is Forgiven\"), a philandering principal (\"Now She Knows She's Wrong,\" which rhymes \"D.N.A.\" and \"P.T.A.\") or masturbation (\"He's My Best Friend\").","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930610","headline":"Stanley Cup Returns to the Citadel in Montreal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/sports/hockey-stanley-cup-returns-to-the-citadel-in-montreal.html","abstract":"  Aside from a colorful coach and a first-rate goalie, the Montreal Canadiens are sort of nondescript.

How well did he do it? Was it worth doing? If Mr. Roche's design for the Jewish Museum's new expansion brings to mind Goethe's standard formula for critical appraisal, that may be because the design itself is somewhat formulaic. It is an appealing formula, and Mr. Roche carries it off with devotion and skill. The building does not lack conviction. But it does lack depth.   This Sunday's long-awaited reopening of the museum after two and a half years of renovations brings to fulfillment an ambitious plan, conceived in 1989, to give the Jewish Museum a home worthy of its mission. With a permanent collection of more than 27,000 objects -- ranging from archeological artifacts to contemporary paintings -- this is the major American museum devoted to Jewish culture and history. The museum has grown in stages since its founding in 1904, when it was provisionally housed in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary. Since 1947, it has occupied the former Warburg Mansion on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street. The choice of Mr. Roche, an internationally celebrated architect whose achievements include the master plan for additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, insured that the museum would assume an even grander presence on Museum Mile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Restaurant Critic Is Named","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/arts/restaurant-critic-is-named.html","abstract":"  The appointment of Ruth Reichl as restaurant critic of The New York Times was announced yesterday by Warren Hoge, assistant managing editor for cultural news and style coverage.

There's some unevenness among the three inaugural exhibitions: \"From the Inside Out: Eight Contemporary Artists,\" an overly tame group show of contemporary art; \"Collecting for the 21st Century: Recent Acquisitions and Promised Gifts,\" a wide-ranging display of recent acquisitions, and \"Culture and Continuity: The Jewish Journey,\" an epic presentation of objects from the museum's permanent collection, whose final sections will not be completely installed until later this summer.

For the first half of the 20th century, major league baseball teams stayed put. From 1950 to 1970, 10 of the 16 original clubs relocated, mostly to other cities, and the determining factor in the move seemed to have been the tilting of the neighborhood around the ball park from white to black.   The statistics that support this theory were presented yesterday to the fifth Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and the American Culture by Professors Alan Sager and Arthur Culbert of the Boston University Schools of Public Health and Medicine. \"We'd been studying urban hospitals,\" said Sager, \"and we found that race was the biggest predictor of hospital relocations and closings.

Many of us had voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush in 1988 because we did not agree with the ideology of the Democratic Party or feel represented by its shrill, often faddish culture. We voted for President Clinton.   I am at a loss to understand how this intelligent man could have misunderstood the \"centrist\" message he conveyed during the campaign and made a first priority of the sexual roles of military personnel; then the firing of the travel bureau of the White House in what appeared to be a failure of due process, and then getting a haircut in a plane on a runway while holding up traffic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Review/Theater; Reviving an Intimate Musical With Romantic Intentions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/theater/review-theater-reviving-an-intimate-musical-with-romantic-intentions.html","abstract":"  THE first time I ever walked out of a Broadway show was to see \"She Loves Me\" a second time.

It was now or never. I bolted out of the 2 o'clock matinee of another flop (remember \"Jennie,\" anyone?) to take one last look at \"She Loves Me\" at 3.   Though I didn't know much about anything else in 1963, time has borne out my youthful infatuation with \"She Loves Me.\" The proof is at the Roundabout Theater Company, where this musical has finally received the exquisite revival of its fans' dreams and where surely new fans will soon be made by the legion. An intimate work with nothing on its sophisticated mind other than romance, \"She Loves Me\" is no less an anomaly on Broadway today than it was 30 years ago.

A decade ago, when he was still too young to drink legally in a club, Aztec Camera's singer and songwriter, Roddy Frame, cornered a little piece of the pop market. A kind of post-punk Van Morrison, he combined a poetic sensitivity, a soulful voice, melancholy melodies and too much innocence in songs that burst with folkish exuberance; on the 1983 album \"High Land, Hard Rain,\" his words tumbled out as if he couldn't believe how much he had to tell. These days Mr. Frame has mellowed a bit, and the arrangements on his fifth album, \"Dreamland\" (Sire)produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto, are smooth and sophisticated, tending toward synthesizers more than acoustic guitars; his voice is a little deeper and more resonant.

The Four Freshmen, the group of singing instrumentalists discovered by Stan Kenton in Dayton, Ohio, in 1950, are going strong after 43 years. Except for Bob Flanigan, the group's leader, who at 66 still sings and plays trombone, the group is now made up of relative youngsters. But the presence of Mr. Flanigan assures that such old Freshmen favorites as \"It's a Blue World\" and \"Day In, Day Out\" are still performed with the group's original harmonic flair, even though there has been a fifth Freshman for several years. At Fat Tuesday's, which has been a regular stop on Freshmen tours for more than 10 years, they will go on tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight; on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M.

Her repertory is a very special mixture of sophisticated wit and nimble rhythm created partly by such old hands as Cole Porter and Noel Coward but leaning more toward contemporary songwriters: Dave Frishberg, John Wallowitch and Miss Dearie herself. Accompanied by the bassist Ray Kilday, she plays a single extended set at 6:30 P.M. today and tomorrow. There is a $15 music charge and a two-drink minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"A Name and a Date For Letterman Show","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/arts/a-name-and-a-date-for-letterman-show.html","abstract":"  David Letterman cannot take the title \"Late Night\" with him when he moves to CBS this summer because it belongs to NBC.

The Shockers will play the winner of today's game between fifth-seeded Louisiana State (51-17-1) and fourth-seeded Long Beach State (46-18). The Shockers, who beat Oklahoma State 12-7 with a late rally in their regular-season meeting this year, took the lead early this time. Walks to Joey Adams, Richie Taylor and Darren Dreifort, his an intentional one with two out, set up Joey Jackson's two-run double in the third. Blake then drove in two with a single and Adam McCollough followed a single by Tommy Tilma with another single to drive in a fifth run off Cowboys starter Jake Benz (9-2). Joe Wallace doubled and Ernesto Rivera drove him home with a single in the bottom of the inning, but Wichita State matched that when Jackson walked with the bases loaded in the fourth.

Becker defeated the 14th-seeded Frenchman, Guillaume Raoux, by 6-4, 6-4, in 80 minutes. Stich marched past 12th-seeded David Wheaton of the United States, 6-4, 6-3. In another match, Grant Stafford, Wednesday's upset winner over top-ranked Pete Sampras, ended his run with a 6-4, 6-3 loss to No. 16 Marc Goellner.

Shriver, seeded No. 7, won the event from 1984-87.
