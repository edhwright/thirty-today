Indeed, perceived from a distance of 150 years, Chopin, Liszt and Schumann seem somehow all of a piece, as willing cohabitants in that world we have come to call Romantic piano music. Charles Rosen's deftly chosen program of piano pieces at the Kathryn Bache Miller Theater on Thursday night separated the three all over again. Call it, if you will, a kind of musicological optometry.   If time has made it hard for us to see Chopin clearly, familiarity makes it even harder. Chopin's piano music is perhaps the most useful repertory that ambitious virtuosos possess, and its ubiquitous presence dulls the impact of music that ought to startle us. Mr. Rosen's first service here was to find pieces still capable of doing so: the late B-major Nocturne and its catalogue of shockingly beautiful modulations; the Barcarolle, whose smooth surfaces scarcely conceal a dying man's sarcasm and despair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931011","headline":"Mary Gene Tuthill, John C.

Kasparov is cruising to victory with a six-point lead, the score now standing at 10 1/2-4 1/2 in his favor.   Short dug in behind a barrier of almost invisible traps, but Kasparov was not fooled. He patiently sidestepped the venom and methodically strengthened his position. Short at first accepted the necessity for groveling, but when Kasparov had readied all his forces for a storm of the black king position at Move 28, the Englishman could stand it no longer and tried for dynamic counterplay. That only fueled Kasparov's attack and the game was soon over.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931011","headline":"Smoltz Is Perfect No More in Post-Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/11/sports/the-playoffs-smoltz-is-perfect-no-more-in-post-season.html","abstract":"  This night was supposed to be worth the wait.

It is a losing battle. As blacks have been \"integrated\" in the entertainment industry, the bourgeoisie has seen its impact diminish.

Ms. Tharp, accelerating Graham movement in a collage with other idioms, has brought out a new virtuosity and range in the dancers. They, in turn, bring the kind of dramatic projection that Ms. Tharp does not find elsewhere, and this has possibly moved her to strike out in a new direction.

Serious in all the wrong ways, the music often turned its back on jazz's functional past. At Weill Recital Hall last Tuesday night, the composers Marty Ehrlich and Don Byron brought their chamber groups in for a concert, and for the most part the pieces avoided the drab pretension of most music working in the gray area between the two forms. At their best they embraced humor, rhythm and lyricism, and spoke of the possibilities in literate chamber music that wasn't afraid of the richness of American popular-music tradition.   Mr. Ehrlich's group, the Emergency Peace Ensemble, which includes Vincent Chancey on French horn, Eric Friedlander on cello and Lindsey Horner on bass, showed Mr. Ehrlich to be one of the premier melodicists of his generation. Even his more brittle pieces were filled with melodies that blossomed slowly, or exploded. On \"Underground Overground,\" he unwrapped an idea redolent with the blues that seemed to suck the air out of the room with its power. Mr. Ehrlich's gift for arranging kept his pieces constantly changing.

In this disease, the temporal lobes on the sides of the brain, where memory and feelings reside, are intermittently seized by chaotic storms of electrical hyperactivity. Although the seizures may be undetectable to observers, they can prompt symptoms like hallucinations, powerful religious sensations, fury, fear, joy and -- a blessing for those in the arts -- an unquenchable desire to write or draw, a desire that persists even after the seizure is over.   Seizures are different physiological events from episodes of mania or depression, but they can exert on a artists a similar sense of grandeur and mastery. Thom Jones, whose recent collection of extraordinarily original and incantatory short stories, \"The Pugilist at Rest\" (Little, Brown, 1993), is a finalist for the National Book Award, said his temporal lobe epilepsy, which he traces to a brain injury suffered while boxing, profoundly defines his personality and his work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931012","headline":"Simms and Reeves Forged First Links While on the Links","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/12/sports/pro-football-simms-and-reeves-forged-first-links-while-on-the-links.html","abstract":"  The first time Giants Coach Dan Reeves met quarterback Phil Simms was in Hawaii in January 1992.

Did Whitey McCoy, a homosexual and an alcoholic, force young Jack Kahn into bed late one night on Thanksgiving break, or was Jack an accomplice in his own carnal fate?   Mr. Sherman lets the teacher and the student re-enact the incident from each of their clashing points of view, in a pair of scenes that should have a long future in acting classes (and are deftly performed here, by Austin Pendleton as Whitey and Anthony Rapp as Jack). But no sooner does \"Sophistry\" start to resemble David Mamet's \"Oleanna\" than the university sweeps the case under the rug and the playwright does, too. The audience never learns what happened that fateful night in Whitey's bedroom and, a few plot twists notwithstanding, soon stops caring. At which point another play, inchoate but arresting, edges into view.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931012","headline":"With Expectations Low, Yeltsin Arrives in Japan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/12/world/with-expectations-low-yeltsin-arrives-in-japan.html","abstract":"  After twice canceling trips to Japan, President Boris N.
