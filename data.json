As another welcome bonus, the Philharmonic replaced its usual folded flier with a regular program book with complete notes on the music and photos from past summers.   There were musical dividends as well. The first half of the program was devoted to Howard Hanson's \"Romantic\" Symphony (Op. 30), a 1930 work that has been recorded a few times but is rarely heard in concert. It has the makings of a crowd-pleaser: Hanson's melodies have a wonderful sweep, and his plush scoring moves between an Impressionistic shimmer and a brassy heftiness that at times seems downright Brucknerian.

Oh, and those celebrated gold medalists who pioneered the National Basketball Association's penetration to the interior of international competition two summers ago? They may as well accept their places in ancient history with George Mikan and the peach basket that Shaquille O'Neal would dearly love to break into a thousand fragments.   \"As for the Dream Team, I think we'd beat them easily,\" O'Neal crowed today on the eve of the 1994 world basketball championships, after he and some of his teammates tried to tear down a few rims as practice wound down. \"Our legs are a lot younger.\"   By today's flaccid standards, young legs and as-yet undistinguished careers nonetheless actuate huge bank accounts and enormous egos. Coach Don Nelson will send Dream Team II, as the marketing propagandists insist on calling it, into battle Thursday night against Spain in the 16-team, 10-day tournament. The United States pros are the overwhelming favorites to take the gold. Croatia, Brazil, Germany Are Here    Croatia, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist in Barcelona, Spain, is back, with Toni Kukoc, Dino Radja and Stoyko Vrankovic, but, sadly, without the late Drazen Petrovic. Brazil is here, though a movement toward youth forced the eccentric gunner, Oscar Schmidt, off the national team. Germany has Detlef Schrempf and Angola has Herlander Coimbra, whom some may recall as the recipient of Charles Barkley's ceremonial first elbow of the Barcelona Games.   What no country really has, unless Nelson forgets he's not coaching the Warriors and fields an entire lineup of players under 6 feet 4 inches, is a chance to run with the United States for more than a few fanciful moments. And, regardless of what O'Neal and his dunking buddies might believe, the ability to dominate the developing basketball world is about all Dream Team II has in common with the original, which featured three of the best players in the history of the sport.   \"The ignorance of youth, huh?\" laughed Joe Dumars, when asked about O'Neal's boast. Of Championship Caliber    One of three 30-plus veterans sprinkled about the roster, Dumars is the only United States player who owns an N.B.A. championship ring. The two he won with the Detroit Pistons shrink when matched against the total of 12 the original Dream Team had won by the time of the '92 Olympics, thanks to Magic Johnson's five, Larry Bird's three and the two apiece for Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, who added one more.   Dream Team I players had also won four National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament titles (Johnson, Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Christian Laettner to one for Dream Team I (Larry Johnson). And its coach, Chuck Daly, was a two-time N.B.A. champ while Nelson has never advanced beyond a conference final. Beyond that, the original dreamers had Johnson, as a famous athlete who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and Jordan, who had attained Muhammad Ali-like global prominence. The Olympics were a much bigger stage than the world championships and Dream Team I was breaking new ground.   \"I think that's one of the problems for these young guys now,\" said Dumars. \"The N.B.A. has set such a high standard of excellence for entertainment, and now any perceived drop-off is going to seem much worse than it is.   \"You have to look at these guys differently. Most of them are in their second, third and fourth years. Five years from now, Shaquille will have won a couple of titles. Probably Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning. It's not fair to compare these teams.\" Veteran Leadership    Nonetheless, Dumars and his fellow graybeard Dominique Wilkins ride the bus with O'Neal, Mourning, Derrick Coleman, et al., and can't believe what they hear.   \"I'm kind of caught between the two teams,\" said Dumars. \"I played with the older guys in their primes and now I'm with these guys. Believe me, they have some interesting discussions. Like the other day, Alonzo was talking about scoring down low, about this move and that move.   \"Nique told him, 'No big man had more moves than Kevin McHale.' Then I said, 'That's right, McHale could destroy people on the block.' Alonzo said, 'Destroy? Come on.'   \"I said, 'Yeah, all right. Think what you want.' \" REBOUNDS    Given his predilection for small lineups, DON NELSON's starting lineup for the opener against Spain includes three guards, JOE DUMARS, REGGIE MILLER and KEVIN JOHNSON, and SHAQUILLE O'NEAL and SHAWN KEMP. . . . Nelson named Dumars, LARRY JOHNSON and Miller as tricaptains. . . . The United States is in Pool A, with Brazil, Spain and China.

An American cultural icon ever since he won the 1958 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, Mr. Cliburn remains a celebrity, his fame undimmed despite an absence of any real musical achievement since the early 1970's. Abandoning the concert stage in 1978 only increased his allure, and he has performed so rarely since his comeback in 1989 that his every appearance is touted as a historic return. These performances have often been emotional high-wire acts, with word of backstage drama buzzing through the audience.   This was certainly the case on Tuesday evening, when Mr. Cliburn, accompanied by the Moscow Philharmonic and its conductor, Vasily Sinaisky, performed at the Metropolitan Opera House. The concert was part of Mr. Cliburn's first full-fledged tour since what he calls his \"intermission,\" but until the boyish-looking, 60-year-old pianist took the stage, there were doubts about whether he would play. On Thursday, when his 97-year-old mother, Rildia Bee Cliburn, had a stroke, Mr. Cliburn postponed his weekend concerts and flew home to Fort Worth. On Sunday he decided to postpone the Met concert, too, but just before midnight he changed his mind, saying that his mother would want him to go on.

According to Lincoln Center, 10 million people watched the program, and what they heard and saw was a series of performances that moved from the industrial rhythms of Duke Ellington's \"Happy Go Lucky Local,\" a big-band piece based on the rhythms of a train, to \"Blue Port.\" The latter, an introspective, melancholic and spare piece by Art Farmer on fluegelhorn and Gerry Mulligan on baritone saxophone, backed by Ron Carter on bass and Lewis Nash on drums, was a reprise of a group Mr. Mulligan led in the 1950's.

Mr. Hemp hill, a founding member of the World Saxophone Quartet, has one of the most distinct harmonic palettes in jazz. He has put together a sextet, which was a high point of this summer's JVC Festival, and for this series, called Soul Connection, he is investigating just that: jazz's connection to soul music. Sunday's show is at 3 P.M. The concert is free with admission to the museum: $6 for adults, $5 for students and the elderly; children 12 and younger are admitted free when accompanied by an adult. PETER WATROUS Juju, Updated    Sikiru Ayinde Barrister, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. African music, especially from Nigeria, had its moment here almost a decade ago. Musicians in Nigeria haven't heard the news, thankfully, and here comes Barrister, who updates the basic juju sound with a heavier drum section. It's trance music and dance music, and beautiful. It's extremely rare to hear it, so the shows are something special. Sets tomorrow are at 10 P.M. and midnight. There is a $10 cover charge. P. W. Randy Weston    Randy Weston, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Randy Weston is among jazz's great living pianists, and would be just for his touch, which has the percussive qualities of both Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk. He's an exceptional composer as well, having written some of the better ballads of the 1950's; his modern writing is rife with the influence of his African travels. As is his improvising: his rhythms, which he underscores with a judicious use of bright dissonances, can be thrilling. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9, 11 and 12:30 (but no third set on Sunday). There is a $15 cover charge and a $10 minimum. P. W. Marion Brown Benefit    Benefit for Marion Brown, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. Mr. Brown has one of the more limpid alto saxophone sounds to come out of the 1960's and a lyrical approach; his guitar playing is folky. On Sunday, starting at 3 P.M., he is to auction his artwork, to music to be supplied by Archie Shepp, Reggie Workman, Andrew Cyrille, Amina Claudine Myers, Michael Gregory, Abdullah Ibrahim, Pharoah Sanders, Hamiet Bluiett and many more.

In fact, part of the excitement of a Grateful Dead concert is the hope that the band will unveil a new piece in embryonic form.    The Grateful Dead evolves through performances, not records, and isn't afraid to fall on its face during its live improvisations.  On Wednesday night at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in front of a sold-out house of 55,000, the Grateful Dead fell and picked itself up again.
