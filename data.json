During the boycott, a bitter nine-month stalemate between Hollywood producers and New York film unions, the major studios virtually shut down film making in the city.

These latest paintings involve extremely thin fiberglass panels that resemble sheets of vellum, tacked to the walls by tiny nails; the strips of wax paper along the tops of each work are also stapled to the walls. The panels are matte-white with occasional hints of silver and blue, and some of the larger ones have grids lightly drawn onto them.

A blue wisp of cigarette smoke curls into a dim light, its sinuous swirls dancing to a saxophone's sultry phrases. The hour is well after midnight, but the music has suspended time. Rapt lone listeners hang on every note; couples lean over martini glasses and gaze into each other's eyes across tiny tables. They're taking part in a venerable ritual of a New York City weekend: the late set at a jazz club.    The cinematic image has changed hardly at all between \"Young Man With a Horn\" and \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" or \"Mo' Better Blues.\" Yet a late set in early-1990's Manhattan doesn't necessarily take place in the glittering nether worlds of the movies. Wandering among late sets on recent weekends, I've found less haze in the air, more tourists in the seats, the elegant couples replaced by a motley assortment that's likely to include students, bohemian types, couples and groups and plaid-jacketed oddballs. But at clubs that have been around for decades, the late set on a Friday or Saturday night can still be an event of nearly wordless intimacy, where partners onstage and strangers in the audience grow closer than ever, sharing a search for moments of spontaneous musical bliss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930108","headline":"Albany Reaches Accord to Trim Increase in Blue Cross Premiums","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/08/nyregion/albany-reaches-accord-to-trim-increase-in-blue-cross-premiums.html","abstract":"  One week after the Cuomo administration granted a major rate increase to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, New York State officials agreed today to give the company a one-time infusion of cash that would reduce the most severe increases in health insurance premiums.

Kovalenko got his 15th goal of the season at 1 minute 35 seconds of overtime. Claude Lapointe passed from the left boards to the left side of the slot, where Kovalenko one-timed a 30-footer to the left of goalie John Blue.

Dahlen registered his third career hat trick and the first by a North Star in 41 games this season. On Wednesday night, Lemieux left Pittsburgh's game against Boston in the second period, complaining of a stiff back.

Dineen notched the Flyers' first goal at 5:43 of the first period off a scramble in front. Dineen had just two goals in his previous 20 games and 2 points in his last eight contests. His hat trick last night leaves him with 11 goals for the season.

In last night's game, Shanahan took a pass from Nelson Emerson in the right circle and fired the puck past goalie Mike Vernon to give the Blues consecutive victories for the first time since Oct. 31. (AP) Oilers 3, Blackhawks 3: Steve Larmer's second goal of the game with 5:38 left in the third period earned host Chicago the tie. Larmer took a pass from Michel Goulet, who had circled the Oilers' net as goaltender Bill Ranford was shoved into the net, and jammed the puck over the goal line. It marked the 11th straight season that Larmer, playing in his 843rd straight game, has scored 25 goals.

is a sign of the decline of the power of unions in the New York City newspaper industry, highlighting deep and, some say, permanent divisions between unions that once derived their power from unity. News analysis, Page 1.  NEW OWNER'S TOUR OF INSPECTION   The new owner of The Daily News, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, made his appearance among the paper's blue-collar workers at the tabloid's Brooklyn plant the night before the newspaper officially became his. \"It's amazing,\" he said repeatedly as he gazed at his newest $36.3 million acquisition. Page 1.  OLIVE BRANCH OFFERED TO NEWS STAFF   The new owner assumed control of The Daily News with an olive branch for the news staff he had decimated in an economy measure and a firm pledge to restore his new, $36.3 million property to its glory days. Page 26.  DINKINS'S AIDES WEIGHED FOR U.S. JOBS   Four of Mayor Dinkins's chief social policy advisers, including Andrew M. Cuomo, who headed his commission on homelessness, are in the running for high-ranking jobs in the Clinton Administration, officials said. Page 27.  OFFICIAL LEFT NOTEBOOK AFTER DEATH   In the month before his body was found in an Albany motel room, a beleaguered Bronx school district superintendent filled a notebook with complaints about educational policies in the city, law-enforcement officials said. Page 27.  LAWYERS REBUKED IN ALLEN-FARROW FIGHT   The judge in the custody battle between Woody Allen and Mia Farrow has upbraided their lawyers for taking the case to reporters. Page 27.  NO SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FOR CROWN HTS.   Governor Cuomo rejected a request for a special prosecutor in the case of a black man beaten by a group of Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Page 28.  REGION   CHANGE ASKED IN BORROWING   Every year, New York State faces another yawning budget gap. And every year, it comes up with another creative financing maneuver to balance its books. But, to the cautious praise of fiscal watchdogs, Governor Cuomo proposed changing the way the state structures its long-term borrowing. Page 28.  DRAWINGS USED IN SEX-ASSAULT TRIAL   Prosecutors in the Glen Ridge, N.J., sex-assault case being tried in Newark used drawings made by a mildly retarded young woman to press their argument that the four young men on trial forced her to perform sex acts.

FEUD COMPLICATES SEARCH FOR GIRL   Almost two weeks after she disappeared, the Suffolk County police have found no trace of 10-year-old Katie Beers, and the County Police Commissioner said that the search has been complicated by a long-running dispute between the girl's mother and godmother.

One sign of this groping is the very date of the letter -- more than a month after Mr. Clinton's election. The delay reflects a fundamental disagreement between the church and the new Administration over an issue that has generated more than its share of discord over the years: abortion.

But on Wednesday, to the cautious praise of fiscal watchdogs who have long criticized his borrowing practices, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed changing the way the state does its long-term borrowing.  No More Sleight of Hand    Under the proposal, quasi-governmental authorities like the Urban Development Corporation would no longer be able to float bonds to build things they were never intended to build, like prisons.

His memorial piece -- revived by the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night -- was intended for Mstislav Rostropovich, who in 1968 ran into trouble with the Soviet authorities and was unable to travel to Edmonton, Alberta, to play the premiere. The central event, the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had happened earlier that year.   Mr. Morawetz's piece is a kind of oratorio without words in which cello solos and a stringless orchestra -- all winds, brass and percussion -- depict violent death and mourning and intermittently comment on it. The tone is pessimistic in a particularly 20th-century way. Tragedy equals catastrophe; mourning becomes hopelessness without redemption. Brass and timpani are by turns angry and ominous. The cello part emanates in a liquid baritonal legato; the composer has gone out of his way to oblige a player with a big tone and expansive personality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930109","headline":"Rutgers Feels Cuts, but President Won't Cry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/09/nyregion/rutgers-feels-cuts-but-president-won-t-cry.html","abstract":"  Dr. Francis L.

The leading faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has shattered, pointing the way to a realignment that could eventually bring an American-style two-party system. For a time, political infighting could make it harder for Tokyo to deliver on diplomatic deals. In the longer run, democratic competition would be good for Japan, and the U.S.    Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most formidable younger politician and its most fiercely ambitious, forced the split.
