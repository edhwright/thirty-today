Buttery breakfast pastries and moist muffins ($1.25 and up) are served with coffee and fresh juices.   Lunch items, to take out or eat in at little cafe tables or at the counter, include sandwiches (roasted vegetables, for example, or French-style ham, $5 to $6), salads (like ratatouille, couscous with vegetables or lentils, mostly $2 to $5 a pound), and main dishes, including roast chicken ($4.50 to $12). There are also dessert tarts, cakes and cookies. The shop is open from 9 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. A Second Porcini Trading    Porcini Trading, a small produce market that opened last fall at 1450 Second Avenue (75th Street), has just opened a second, larger market at 1510 Second Avenue (78th Street). The owners plan to keep both stores open. The new market sells some prepared foods and has a broader selection of groceries and dairy products than the original market. Both now have fresh imported porcini mushrooms from Italy. They range in price from $7.50 to $30 a pound, depending on the size and quality, which for the beefy top-of-the-line ones is impeccable.  Corrado Opens a Market    Joining Corrado, a restaurant at 1373 Avenue of the Americas (55th Street), and its neighboring Corrado Cafe and Corrado Kitchen catering shop is the new Corrado Market. But instead of being clustered with the other Corrado properties, this food market and catering shop is uptown, at 1409 Second Avenue (73d Street). It is a spacious, rather homey-looking food market with a typical array of produce, breads, cheeses and some high-end packaged groceries like olive oils and pasta.   Some of the prepared food items are especially delicious, like the penne pasta with eggplant, baked butternut squash, linguine with shiitake mushrooms, all for $7 a pound, and the fresh salmon salad, $15 a pound. The market is open every day. Telephone: (212) 472-9200. Mail-Order Spices    Adriana's Bazaar, a retail store on the Upper West Side that sold spices and condiments from around the world until it closed earlier this year, has become Adriana's Caravan, a mail-order company in Brooklyn with a catalogue of more than 1,000 items. Copies of the catalogue can be ordered for $3 by calling (800) 316-0820. A condensed version of the catalogue is free. Hot Stuff in Flux    Another source of spiciness may also switch to mail order. Hot Stuff, a shop specializing in spicy ingredients, at 227 Sullivan Street (near Bleecker Street), will close at the end of the year. David Jenkins, the owner, said he hoped to open a new store elsewhere in Manhattan with a small restaurant, to help generate better sales, or to convert it into a mail order house.  The Parlor Set    The younger generation should be more than happy with the fare at Mr. Chips, 27 East 92d Street, a classy new ice-cream parlor owned by Chip Fisher. Mr. Fisher, who has young children and lives in the neighborhood, also owns Fisher & Levy, a cafe and caterer, and Lamalle Kitchenware.    The new ice-cream parlor is sleekly modern, done in blond wood, with low counters and child-height stools in sherbet pastels. A swath of chalk board, with chalk provided, covers the wall above the counter. The ice cream comes in more than a dozen flavors. The restaurant is open from 11:30 A.M to 10 P.M. on weekdays, and from noon to 10 P.M. on weekends. Battle of the Wines    An all-day tasting to compare American chardonnays and pinot noirs with French red and white Burgundies made from the same grapes has been scheduled for Dec. 10 at the International Wine Center, 231 West 29th Street, Suite 210. The tasting, which will begin at 10 A.M. and end at about 4:30 P.M., will cover 42 wines and include lunch. The wines will be tasted blind in groups of three. The fee for the tasting is $235 and must be paid in full to secure a reservation. More information is available from the Wine Center, (212) 268-7517. Indian Feast in Queens    Dinner for 50,000?

In the front row at a White House rally this week for GATT -- the international trade accord that the House leadership will try to bring to a vote today -- sat Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, and Brent Scowcroft, its national security adviser. Free trade is a bipartisan policy and, after the cold war, the country's foremost foreign policy. Trade binds disparate nations and creates wealth; the GATT accord is expected to raise world income by $500 billion, and American income alone by $100 billion.    That is why it is important for the House to stop stalling and approve the GATT accord today. The Senate -- because of the unconscionable opposition of a single textile-belt Senator, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina -- must wait until after elections to vote. Once the U.S. ratifies the treaty, more than 100 other nations are likely to follow soon. But delay plays into the hands of protectionists abroad.   Besides die-hard protectionists, some environmental and consumer groups also oppose the accord. These opponents worry that international dispute panels, which oversee enforcement of GATT rules, might undermine U.S. health, safety and environmental laws. But the threat is mostly fictitious -- as a ruling this week by such a dispute panel convincingly proves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941005","headline":"Woman Tells Of Retaliation For Complaint On Tailhook","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/05/us/woman-tells-of-retaliation-for-complaint-on-tailhook.html","abstract":"  Paula A.

Images flash of a body bag, a chalk outline of a corpse, \"for sale\" signs, a \"going out of business\" sign. Finally, the camera pans across a rubble-strewn city lot, followed by a grim-looking shot of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (the producers say the photographs were all taken in New York over the last week). SCRIPT -- \"This is Mario Cuomo's New York. Cuomo coddles criminals. Day and night, we are in danger -- on the street, at work, in school, even in our homes. Cuomo imposes crippling taxes. Business withers, jobs disappear, families suffer, dreams die. Cuomo plays politics. Working men and women pay the bills. Twelve years of Mario Cuomo. Can you afford four more? Dump Cuomo. Build New York.\" ACCURACY -- It is true that people can often be in danger in New York, that some businesses wither and that some dreams die, but it is difficult if not impossible to make a case that it is true of New York alone or that Mr. Cuomo is solely responsible. But this dark portrait is not meant as history; it is an emotional summation of the three themes that may defeat Mr. Cuomo: crime, jobs and taxes. SCORECARD -- This ad was financed by the real estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld, but it is as if it came from Dante, depicting New York as hell. There has been bad blood between the two men: in 1986, Mr. Cuomo knocked Mr. Hirschfeld off the ballot when he tried to run for lieutenant governor and last year, Mr. Cuomo successfully opposed Mr. Hirschfeld's attempts to buy the New York Post. Though he says it is not revenge, Mr. Hirschfeld says he is spending from $250,000 to $1 million to broadcast this ad, first in New York City and Albany, then perhaps across the state. Mr. Hirschfeld said he supports the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki (who is not mentioned in the ad), but that his primary reason for the ad was \"to help my fellow man\" by presenting his vision of New York State under Mr. Cuomo.    As a bit of television drama, it makes its case with undeniable force. But some viewers might see it as being so negative, its claims so sweeping, that they might dismiss it entirely.

Realism, of course, is a slippery thing: now that a televised production from Rome has presented the work staged in the actual settings and at the right times of day, Mr. Zeffirelli's grandiose, intensely detailed sets look less like virtual reality and more like theatrical facsimiles. And say what one will about them, they are really distracting only when the singing and acting fail to command the attention.   That was not a problem on Wednesday. Luciano Pavarotti, who has been known to sleepwalk through \"Tosca\" in recent seasons, was in spectacular form as Cavaradossi. His voice sounded younger and fresher than it did a year ago, and he sang with a passion and magnetism that made his Cavaradossi a defiant hero. In his showpieces, \"Recondita armonia\" and \"E lucevan le stelle,\" he found an emotional depth that made the arias moving rather than merely crowd-pleasing. Smaller touches were equally effective: Cavaradossi's brief celebration of Napoleon's victory -- his shouted \"Vittoria! Vittoria!\" in the second act -- rarely has the spontaneity or the chilling power that Mr. Pavarotti brought to it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"From the Early Days, Images of a Voyager Who Died at 24","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/arts/photography-review-from-the-early-days-images-of-a-voyager-who-died-at-24.html","abstract":"  Until recently, the photography of the 19th century was like a lost continent, a semi-mythical place known largely through images whose subjects and makers were equally forgotten. In recent years, though, scholars have begun to retrieve the riches of early photography from the depths of time, assembling substantial bodies of work by major figures, uncovering details about their lives and researching the often arcane processes they used.   The fruits of some of those efforts are on view in New York City this month. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is featuring the work of Edouard Baldus, a French photographer famed for his commanding views of architecture and industrial forms in the 1850's; in SoHo, the James Danziger Gallery, in association with Hans P. Kraus Jr., is presenting the work of John B.

This is a world of androids and robots, created to ape humanity in its daily routines of commerce and domesticity. At its center is Mathew, a walking, whirring, clicking halfway house between sensitivity and automatic response. Within his artificial body stirs unresolved conflict between the human demiurges who have created him and the obedient machine he has become.

Neil Jenney (born in 1945) is one of them, and six of his chilly, immaculately executed paintings have been brought together as part of the Collection in Context series at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Organized by Elizabeth Sussman, the show leaves no doubt that Mr. Jenney is an artist overdue for reassessment, but it also suggests why he remains a marginal figure.    His debt to earlier American art is clear at a glance. His reiterated images of blasted trees and sunset skies, for example, were standard Hudson River School emblems of decay and renewal, fraught with allegorical implications. Mr. Jenney acknowledges the symbolic nature of his own paintings by stenciling their didactic-sounding titles directly onto their frames. The frames themselves -- thick, shelflike and painted black -- recall the prosceniumlike structures used by Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt to turn their landscape paintings into near-cinematic spectacles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"G.O.P.

Last week City Hall told the department to come up with a relatively small reduction of $60 million in its $2 billion budget, an acknowledgment that the police must share in resolving New York City's budget crisis. Then the Mayor seemed to hesitate, saying he hoped the cuts would not be necessary. But they are. The police have their share of bloat and should be asked to shed it at a time when other vital services are being slashed.   It is important, however, that the Mayor make cuts in the right way. News reports suggest budget officials may want to shrink the department's civilian payroll by as much as one-third. That could actually weaken patrol strength, a perverse result of a law designed to strengthen policing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"Clinton Exults in Swift Success Of U.S. Military Force in Haiti","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/world/mission-haiti-washington-clinton-exults-swift-success-us-military-force-haiti.html","abstract":"  The House of Representatives early today passed a resolution approved Thursday by the Senate that gave the White House some measure of support for the American military mission in Haiti.

The lower house of Parliament, dominated by a coalition of former Communists and their allies, overwhelmingly passed a bill called the Official State Secrets Act, which would stifle the lively independent media that have grown up over the past four years. The upper house, with the same parties in control, was expected to approve the bill as well, perhaps as soon as this week.   But the Polish press fought back and, although the danger has not completely passed, the censors are now in retreat. Upper house action is stalled, lower house leaders are having second thoughts and President Lech Walesa promises to veto the bill if it reaches his desk in anything like its present form.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"From Postwar Italy, With Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/arts/art-review-from-postwar-italy-with-style.html","abstract":"  YOU needn't have cruised down the Via Veneto on a Vespa in the 1960's to know what is meant by la dolce vita.

Beginning in the late 50's, the country enjoyed what Italians considered to be a miracle of economic and industrial expansion after the degradation of the Fascist years. But the biggest miracle was the number of talented people who came to maturity after World War II and gave to resurging Italy a culture and style that reached a peak by the mid-60's.   \"The Italian Metamorphosis, 1943-1968,\" which fills the Guggenheim Museum, is a gigantic survey of what they accomplished in painting and sculpture, film and photography, fashion, architecture and design between the fall of Mussolini and the rise of a generation opposed to Italy's new opulence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"John Merriman, professor of history at Yale University, is reading \"Seducing the French\" by Richard F.
