But there they were, the Vietnam dove and the Vietnam hawk, sitting around the White House living room bound together by their shared support of of increased aid to Russia.  A1 ZAIRE'S BATTLING LEADERS   The President and the Prime Minister of Zaire both say they have the authority to rule the large, impoverished African nation. Their battle for control has paralyzed the Government and cast doubt about its future stability.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.84 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 3,469.42.  A1 LESSONS FROM POLICE-KILLERS   Two F.B.I. agents interviewed 50 killers of police officers in an effort to discover what the victims could have done differently. The result is a chilling collection of murderous narratives that could change officers' behavior.

By evening's end, the audience will have seen a husband and wife beat each other senseless, and another husband return home to his wife with welts on his back after a night of flagellation by a transvestite. As a framed dime-store Jesus looks down from the wall, the whipped husband drops to his knees, demanding still more punishment. His wife obliges, pouring alcohol on his open wounds.   Such is the tough theatrical currency of \"Aven' U Boys,\" a work in which the agonized screams of the characters often blend into the apocalyptic metal-on-metal screech of the el roaring above their heads. The audience at the John Houseman Theater, or at least that part of it with strong stomachs, holds on tight. \"Aven' U Boys\" is not for those with a low tolerance for verbal and visual violence, but it can be enthusiastically recommended to anyone who wants to step into a fever dream of urban America 1993, as searingly realized by a new and gifted 29-year-old playwright named Frank Pugliese and as played for keeps by a half-dozen young actors of exciting promise. While Mr. Pugliese's Italian-American Brooklyn overlaps the Brooklyn or Bronx of Richard Price, Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, his gripping style, in which fragmented dialogue and incidents seem to slice through the night like switch blades, casts its own disturbing spell.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Clinton Challenged on Share of U.S. Aid Going to Israel and Egypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/world/clinton-challenged-on-share-of-us-aid-going-to-israel-and-egypt.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration was forced by an influential Democrat in Congress today to confront the delicate subject of whether the United States can afford to pour billions of dollars into Israel and Egypt in light of a shrinking foreign aid budget and President Clinton's determination to resuscitate the American economy.

That is what the Boston College basketball season has been reduced to, a game in the opening round of the Big East tournament that could lead to another game that could lead to something more; a high-stakes series of circumstances that must begin with Villanova on Thursday night. It is a night that for all its traditional stigma -- collecting the bottom of the league in a doubleheader matching the seventh-seeded and 10th-seeded teams and Nos. 8 vs. 9 -- still holds possibilities.   There is the chance to continue the positive steps the Eagles have shown in a 9-9 Big East season, the most Boston College conference victories in a decade. There is the means of measuring progress from that painful night two years ago, when a 1-15 team lost a 10-point lead to Villanova on Thursday night. N.C.A.A. Bid in Peril    And there is time to reverse the tone of a season that has seemed, on the surface, to be increasingly contentious. Jim O'Brien, the coach of the Eagles, understands that his team finished in a four-way tie for fourth place, became the seventh-seeded team as a result of a tie breaker, and could have finished No. 3 if not for an emotional loss here to Providence last Saturday night.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"A Little Pasta With Your Armani Jacket?

There is little more painful or less inspiring of song than watching as someone you love is cut off from life by illness.

It was at once a relief and a disappointment to discover that its occasional and ineffectual stabs at sentimentality notwithstanding, \"Wings\" is more concerned with the mind than the heart.    Indeed, that is literally the case: like the Kopit play, to which it is largely faithful, this quasi opera is obsessed with the collapse of brain functions that is known as aphasia. In the opening scene, the elderly heroine, Emily (Linda Stephens), an aviator who long ago was an air-show wing walker, has her stroke, and the audience is immediately transported into a mind in which memories are obliterated, language is garbled, logic is short-circuited. Some of that voyage is accomplished visually, by shattered images projected on sliding screens, and some of it by the evocative Sensurround-style sonic effects created by Richard Woodbury.

Simon & Schuster. $27.50.   In his classic study, \"An American Dilemma,\" published 49 years ago, Gunnar Myrdal wrote that the problems confronting disadvantaged blacks in a dominant white society put a spoke through the wheels of democracy. Yet the Swedish economist recognized that despite slavery and adversity, blacks helped to hold the country's social fabric together. In his chapter on black family life in the rural South, he said that blacks had built up their own kind of close-knit family organizations that were conducive to social health.   Now in \"Climbing Jacob's Ladder,\" Andrew Billingsley, a respected black sociologist, builds on Myrdal's work and offers his own surprisingly optimistic study about the inner strength and stability of black families. Professor Billingsley, chairman of the family studies department at the University of Maryland and visiting scholar in residence at Spelman College in Atlanta, finds that like white strivers on the lower rungs of society, blacks also want to gain entry into the American middle class. The new book, a sequel to his \"Black Families in White America,\" published in 1968, continues his argument that black families are born survivors and contain the seeds of their own rejuvenation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"In Europe, Musicals Get Varying Reactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/theater/in-europe-musicals-get-varying-reactions.html","abstract":"  Cole Porter may have epitomized dapper American sophistication between the world wars, but his image had a Gallic aura.

Hill & Wang, $25. \n\nIn 14 years of environmental reporting at The New York Times, Philip Shabecoff saw American environmentalism rise and fall and rise again. He met colorful characters from James Watt, Ronald Reagan's fundamentalist Interior Secretary, to David Brower, the grand curmudgeon who brought the Sierra Club to political life. On his beat the world reached an agreement to save the ozone layer and the Audubon Society fought about keeping the egret as its symbol.\n\nRecognizing how crucial the experience of the American land has been in shaping American environmental thought, Mr. Shabecoff begins his book with an east-to-west eagle flight over the continent as it would have appeared at the time of Columbus 500 years ago: occupied by natives, but virgin to a European eye, and blessed with passenger pigeons, buffalo, pristine waters and unbelievable riches in timber, minerals and soil.\n\nThe story continues through the Lewis and Clark expedition, through Daniel Boone, John James Aububon, Emerson, Thoreau and George Perkins Marsh in Woodstock, Vt., setting down in the 1860's the first principles of sustainable resource management. There is the strange association of President Theodore Roosevelt with Gifford Pinchot, the forester, and John Muir, the mountain man, whose interacting passions produced the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the preservation of Yosemite Valley as a national park and the flooding of Hetch Hetchy Valley, Yosemite's twin, to provide water and power for San Francisco. Already the battle between development and preservation was joined.\n\nThere is a parade of personalities: Rachel Carson, William O. Douglas, Lois Gibbs, the embattled housewife of Love Canal, and Aldo Leopold, the ecologist and game manager who appears to be one of the few people able to embrace both sides of the use-it-conserve-it dilemma. Mr. Leopold gave Mr. Shabecoff his title, in a passage that describes his own ecological conversion. \n\nSome years ago Mr. Leopold and some friends had found a mother wolf with her cubs and had shot them. \"We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce, green fire dying in her eyes,\" Mr. Leopold recalled in his book \"Sand County Almanac.\" \"I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes -- something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch. I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean a hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.\"\n\nMr. Shabecoff throws in this quote without connecting it to his title, but his position is not that the fierce, green fire of American environmentalism is dying. Rather, he sees it surging up and down in waves, three so far: first, the Roosevelt-Pinchot conservation movement of the early 1900's; second, the burst of landmark environmental legislation around the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, and third, the professionalism and pragmatism of the present.\n\nHis last chapter offers advice for the fourth wave. Get political, Mr. Shabecoff says. We have green publications, green technology, green products. Now we need green politics.\n\n\"To make the political breakthroughs necessary to achieve their goals,\" Mr. Shabecoff writes, \"the environmentalists \n\nmust \n\nmake common cause with other sectors of our society that have a stake in changing the political and economic status quo.\" That alliance is natural, he points out, when you look to see who gains from polluting, and who gets polluted. He makes the interesting observation that \"the Black Caucus . . . has the best voting record, year in and year out, on environmental issues of any interest group in Congress.\"\n\nIt's too bad that Mr. Shabecoff's courageous advice comes at the end of his book, not at the beginning, and that the early parts of the book are written in a plodding style that may not carry readers through to the end. Mr. Shabecoff admits that he is a journalist, not a historian. Until he gets to history that he himself witnessed, he does not make his story come alive. It's as if he were working through a list of names and ideas that need to be mentioned, describing each one dutifully, but rushing to get to the good stuff: the Reagan Administration and Anne Gorsuch Burford, the Bush promise and disappointment. He doesn't even tick off the history list in chronological order, so one can get confused about whether Barry Commoner might have been influenced by Rachel Carson or vice versa.\n\nThere is one more problem with this book, one that might have arisen from 14 years of environmental reporting under constant pressure to be objective. Mr. Shabecoff lets his bias loose in this book. Too loose. There are too many preachy sentences about \"the urbanized, overcivilized materialism that is engulfing late 20th-century America\" and about human beings having \"for the first time . . . the ability to make the world uninhabitable for their own species.\"\n\nIt would have been better to tell the story of the settlement and degradation of a glorious continent, of political corruption and senseless waste of resources and of the eloquent voices raised against that folly, and to let readers come to their own conclusions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-961993.html","abstract":"  Ngoc Lam and Que Lam Music of Vietnam Metropolitan Museum of Art    Vietnamese music, as played by Ngoc Lam and her daughter Que Lam on Sunday afternoon, is a sphere of pristine melodies, openwork counterpoint and an occasional delicate swirl.

Most of the actors graduated from the Juilliard School, where they presumably studied with Mr. Langham, until recently the head of its drama division. The result is a closer responsiveness between the performers and the director than is often found at Theater for a New Audience. The cast evokes memories of that earlier group of Juilliard graduates who became the charter members of the Acting Company.   In his distinguished career, Mr. Langham has staged a number of productions of \"Love's Labour's Lost,\" in England, at the Stratford Festival in Canada and at Juilliard. He is a master of the play's gently satiric humors. This time, he views the comedy as more autumnal than vernal. Russet colors dominate the palette in Douglas Stein's attractive set. One might suggest that the feeling in the air is that of homecoming or post-graduation, as the King of Navarre gathers his three closest friends for three years of celibacy and learned discourse.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"REPORTS WARNING OF H.U.D.

Her beheading still strikes terror into the hearts of those who witnessed the rise and empowerment of the Nazi regime, which reached its height of brutality in those days of 1943 and 1944, when its leaders realized the war was lost. Stalingrad had just become the nemesis of the Eastern front, and the air bombardment of German cities had begun, bringing home that the supposed invincibility of the German Reich was a myth.   Mildred Harnack-Fish, I presume, was married to the son of Dr. Adolf von Harnack, the theologian and humanist, once director general of the Prussian State Library and president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (after World War II, the Max Planck Institute). Adolf von Harnack was a scientist of great distinction, who represented the best of German culture and thinking. It is no wonder that in such an environment as the young Harnacks lived, Nazi ideology kindled active resistance.   Almost concurrent with Mildred Harnack-Fish's death, Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl, brother and sister students at the University of Munich, were executed at Stadelheim Prison in Munich. They and several more students and a professor were members of the White Rose, a secret society whose main sin had been to print and distribute leaflets and other material to appeal to the conscience of academic circles in Bavaria and to counter the lies of German victories on the many war fronts.    These young people, like the July 20, 1944, resistance group, were victims of the Volksgerichtshof (the People's court) under Judge Roland Freisler. All were condemned to death. Luckily for Freisler, he died in an air raid, instead of at the Nuremberg war crimes trials, where he belonged.

The answer is, keeping mostly out of sight, but very much involved and in charge -- to the point of telling his top aides exactly what he wants them to keep in mind even before policy choices bubble up to him. In a demanding and sometimes intimidating style, he almost always urges them to think broadly and act cautiously within a consensus.   Mr. Clinton actually devotes considerable time daily to his foreign chores. But he shuns the world spotlight, partly to show the folks at home he's minding their business and partly because he's still leery about his international footing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Much At Stake In Big East Tourney","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/sports/college-basketball-much-at-stake-in-big-east-tourney.html","abstract":"  In the 1980's, the Big East tournament was less a four-day exercise to determine the conference champion than a lucrative tuneup for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's 64-team tournament that followed, as five to six teams went into the weekend virtually assured of moving on.
