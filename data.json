This week, 14 more cops from Harlem's scandal-ridden 30th Precinct were arrested on corruption charges, bringing the total number of arrests there to 29. Two sergeants were taken in as well, suggesting that active complicity in corruption runs higher than the cop on the  beat. The shameful behavior in Harlem's \"Dirty 30\" precinct underscores the need for a permanent independent anti-corruption agency to help stamp out police crime before it becomes so widespread.         The rogue cops in the 30th called themselves \"Nannery's Raiders,\" after their supervising officer, Sgt. Kevin P. Nannery. The band is charged with faking police radio and 911 emergency calls to cover up illegal raids on drug dealers'  apartments, during which they seized drugs and stole large amounts of cash. The  Mollen Commission noted that supervising officers often looked the other way while street cops ran wild. But Sergeant Nannery allegedly went further and became an enthusiastic participant. In one case, investigators say, the sergeant and two of his \"raiders\" stopped a man in an apartment building, took his keys and then ransacked his apartment. They found several thousand dollars' worth of  drugs and cash, took the money and then let the dealer go. The officers also perjured themselves in many court cases, a development that could eventually lead to the dismissal of as many as 50 cases.

The attraction was not the gala opening of the Carnegie Hall season, nor was it the presence of Sir Neville Marriner conducting the Academy of St.-Martin-in-the-Fields. Despite the orchestra's 1,000 or so recordings and widely respected achievements, the focus of attention was on Cecilia Bartoli, who is arguably the only classically trained singer under the age of 45 who is a box-office and recording star.         Toward the concert's end, one heard why. In a selection from Bellini's \"Sonnambula,\" Ms. Bartoli's voice became an expression of pure delight: sensuous, exuberant and overflowing. Amina's rapturous series of declarations, extending from \"Care compagne, e voi, teneri amici\" to \"Sovra il sen la man mi posa,\" is a celebration of unqualified, innocent love. Ms. Bartoli gave it precisely that character. The florid ornaments were never matters of display; they never proclaimed: \"Look what my voice can do. Don't you like it?\" Instead,  the turns and roulades seemed to be emotion transmuted into sound, eruptions of  feeling that could not be constrained by a simple melodic line.

Ms. Horn knows how it feels to be a musician's delight and a commercial unknown. When Verve Records signed her in 1988, the singer and pianist had spent 30 years as a cult figure in Washington.

CURRICULUM VITAE: Autobiography By Muriel Spark. Houghton Mifflin, $10.95. Who was the model for Miss Jean Brodie? Who inspired the sad finality of \"Memento Mori\"? This memoir of the author's first 39 years reveals what was autobiography and what was invention in many of her novels, as well as the facts behind her early failed marriage and her conversion to Roman Catholicism. Last year our reviewer, Helen Bevington, said, \"Reticent when she chooses but always free of invention, Muriel Spark succeeds in her mission: she puts the record straight.\" \"Curriculum Vitae\" ends with the publication of Ms. Spark's first novel, THE COMFORTERS (New Directions, $10.95), which has just been reissued. In it a writer and Catholic convert begins hearing voices that make her realize she is a fictional character herself. The book \"adds to the growing evidence that Kingsley Amis and other members of the 'couldn't-care-less' school of writers are not the only lively force in British fiction today,\" Aileen Pippett said in The New York Times in 1957. New Directions has also restored to print THE DRIVER'S SEAT (New Directions Bibelot, $6), Ms. Spark's novel about a breezy young European woman who sets off on a vacation to find a boyfriend and determinedly orchestrates her own demise.

He is best known for his \"Bachiana Brasileira\" No. 5, scored for soprano and eight cellos, which has been recorded by everyone from Victoria de los Angeles, who sang it on the composer's own recording, to Galina Vishnevskaya and Kiri Te Kanawa. But he also wrote a great body of folk songs, many of them with texts in obscure Amazon Indian languages and the Afro-Brazilian patois.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941002","headline":"Challenging Kuhn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/sports/l-challenging-kuhn-418447.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   What planet has Bowie Kuhn been living on for the last few years (\"Let's Put Reason Back in Baseball Debate,\" Sept. 25, The Times)?

That is not the case with the symphonies of Franz Joseph Haydn, who left behind a confusing tangle of documents relating to his compositions and performances. To arrive at a definitive set of performing parts is a highly contentious matter, and thus grist for the fine-grinding mills of musicologists, who love nothing more than a good scrape.   Although Haydn's 106 symphonies are one of the best-known and most widely performed bodies of work in Western music, they have not always been well served by the record labels. Just four years ago, the CD catalogue lacked a complete set of them. But now three complete Haydn symphony projects are under way, and although the two most interesting ones, led by Christopher Hogwood on L'Oiseau-Lyre and Roy Goodman on Hyperion, both use period instruments, they sound very different. Behind the difference lies a sharp scholarly dispute, as recent conversations with some of the combatants revealed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941002","headline":"Reveille for New Rochelle's Abandoned Army Fort?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/realestate/reveille-for-new-rochelle-s-abandoned-army-fort.html","abstract":"  FOR 27 years, Davids Island, lying unoccupied in Long Island Sound just off this Westchester County city, has enticed developers.

Bernstein was about to remedy that situation. Mahler, he explained, was a great composer and an important conductor; he had led the Philharmonic on that very stage. Though \"one of the most unhappy people in history,\" he often wrote ecstatic music. He was a \"double man,\" caught between opposing worlds. And in everything he wrote, his feelings were \"extreme, exaggerated, like young people's feelings.\" Mahler, Bernstein made clear, was much like himself, even like the listeners who sat before him.   This was a remarkable example of what Bernstein could accomplish in the 53 Young People's Concerts he presented between 1958 and 1972. Scripts for 15 of them have been collected in an Anchor paperback, and videotapes of 25 are available from Sony Classical and the Leonard Bernstein Society; all are models of music teaching. Bernstein talked pungently about modes and keys, pitch intervals and sonata form, folk music in the concert hall and the nature of musical Impressionism. He did not shy away from fundamental questions about meaning in music or the nature of musical humor. There is no one today who can address a young audience with comparable depth and simplicity, and such a person has never been needed more than now.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941002","headline":"Heather Albert And Michael Dyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/style/weddings-heather-albert-and-michael-dyer.html","abstract":"  Heather Leigh Albert, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Burton Albert of Weston, Conn., was married there yesterday to Michael David Dyer, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Richard E.

The musical result was the so-called \"two-tone\" movement. It spawned integrated bands that revived the fast oompah beat of a 1960's Jamaican style called ska, added the raw fervor of punk and laced the resulting party music with messages. Checkerboard graphics, close-cropped hair and natty black-and-white outfits, including skinny ties and porkpie hats, completed the package. The music came and went like other pop fads in Britain, but it found a lasting audience in the United States. On Friday night, Irving Plaza was packed with checkerboard-accessorized, hyperactive dancers for a concert by the Specials, one of the first two-tone bands. A younger, more purist ska band, Let's Go Bowling, opened the concert.

Four members of the current seven-piece Specials were in the original band: Neville Staples (vocals), Roddy (Radiation) Byers (guitar), Lynval Golding (guitar) and Horace Panter (bass). Instead of Terry Hall's yelping lead vocals, the band now has Mr. Byers and Mr. Staples harmonizing with the other band members.

While just 15 percent of the hospitalizations on the Upper West Side in 1992 were considered preventable, 40 percent of those in nearby Harlem and Morningside Heights were for conditions that could have been treated earlier.
