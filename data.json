Mr. Bratton's observation had a soothing affect on a city that became alarmed about reports that nearly one out of five officers in the Harlem precinct lied in court, shook down drug dealers, and drove wildly up and down Broadway in their radio cars. But the revelations of the last two weeks about widespread abuses in the 109th Precinct in Flushing, Queens and the 48th Precinct in the East Tremont section of the Bronx suggest now that that corruption is far more widespread throughout the city, even if in smaller doses, than police officials have acknowledged.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950206","headline":"Our Forked Tongue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/06/opinion/our-forked-tongue.html","abstract":"  In these last years, and notably in these past months, we have heard much of the burden imposed by government on the citizen. Nothing has been more emphasized in speech and possibly also in thought. This comment is not meant to regret this concern, as some might suppose: rather, it is to clarify the way the word \"burden\" is now employed. It has a very special connotation, of which all who cherish good or anyhow accepted English usage should be aware.   As now used, \"burden\" applies only to a very specific range of government activities. Many are not a burden and are not to be so described. Defense expenditure is definitely not a burden; indeed, increases therein are now being proposed. That there is now no wholly plausible enemy does not affect the situation. Similarly, in recent years large sums, in a range upward from $50 billion, have been appropriated to bail out failed financial institutions, specifically the savings and loan associations. This was not a burden. A clear distinction must be made between a burden and an admittedly unfortunate and costly financial misadventure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950206","headline":"A Leak May Alter Discovery's Plans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/06/us/a-leak-may-alter-discovery-s-plans.html","abstract":"  A leaky jet thruster on the space shuttle Discovery yesterday forced ground controllers in Houston and in Kaliningrad, Russia, to race to revise plans for a historic rendezvous today between the winged spaceship and Russia's orbiting Mir space station.

It certainly displays some operatic characteristics. It is inspired by Truman Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" and is scored for voice, film and multitrack tape. But an opera is usually a public event, a narrative meant to communicate something out of the ordinary. On Friday night at the Kitchen, this new 75-minute piece actually seemed private, constructed for those who already know what is to be communicated and why. It is full of codes, signals and inside allusions.   This impression does not really come from the music; it is not an esoteric or difficult score. It contains a Protestant hymn, folk-rock-style accompaniments, some tender motifs, sounds of harmonicas, guitars and strings and much Minimalist patter. It also contains something that Mr. Rouse, who is the sole performer, calls counterpoetry, in which he recites lines in strict meter that are accompanied by other taped lines in strict meter; a phrase might be heard overlapping itself in a sort of metrical fugue, resembling what Glenn Gould accomplished in his radio documentaries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950206","headline":"Peru and Ecuador Wage Guerrilla War as Talks Break Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/06/world/peru-and-ecuador-wage-guerrilla-war-as-talks-break-off.html","abstract":"  With peace talks collapsing in Brazil today, Peruvian and Ecuadorean soldiers tried to settle on a rugged Amazon battlefield what diplomats failed to settle at a negotiating table.

They stepped thoroughly into the work's spirit, Mr. Harrell supplying a melting tone and shapely phrasing and Mr. Bronfman matching his performance closely in both gesture and warmth.    It was a long way from the Debussy to this. Mr. Bronfman had started the Sonata with a hard-eged reading that deprived the work of some of its mystery. Mr. Harrell softened those edges somewhat, but even so, a listener was primarily taken with his technical resources -- his speed, precision and coloration -- rather than with his ability to evoke the magic and exoticism of Debussy's world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950207","headline":"Plumbing the Depths of Two Sad, Vacuous Lives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/07/theater/theater-review-plumbing-the-depths-of-two-sad-vacuous-lives.html","abstract":"  The title character of Austin Pendleton's \"Uncle Bob\" is a familiar type in 20th-century American fiction, from John O'Hara to Joseph Heller.

Discarding their civilized ways, the Inquisitor charged, these women had indulged in the drinking of chocolate and, under its influence, had consorted with the Devil himself. This accusation surprised no one, for the dark, mysteriously seductive drink of the cocoa plant had been famous since the time of the Aztecs as a powerful incantatory tool.\n\nTo some modern sensibilities, attributing such power to chocolate may seem ridiculous. But in a few days, untold numbers of Americans will observe Valentine's Day by presenting a symbol of their love in the form of -- what else? -- chocolates. When they do, they will be paying unwitting homage to the power of food as magic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"1945: Big Three Meet : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/opinion/IHT-1945-big-three-meet-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Josef Stalin announced from their secret meeting place in the Black Sea area tonight [Feb. 7] that they have agreed on plans for the final defeat of Germany and they are now discus","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"Walters Upset By 'Selfish' Anderson","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/sports/pro-basketball-walters-upset-by-selfish-anderson.html","abstract":"  He is either One Angry Man or One Disenchanted Dude, depending on the source.

All you have to do, these experts concluded, is to incorporate a total of about 30 minutes a day of moderate activity into your routines. That means actions like taking stairs instead of elevators and escalators, walking short distances instead of driving door to door, gardening, raking leaves, doing housework, dancing, playing actively with children or pets, riding a stationary bicycle while watching the evening news, playing golf without a cart or doing any other activities at the intensity of a brisk walk for however long you choose -- as long as you log a total of 30 minutes a day.

He expected to meet the same combative Colin Ferguson who has sparred with other victims of the Long Island Rail Road shooting, questioning their memories and their honesty.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"The Neediest Cases; Many Give to the Needy In Memory of Loved Ones","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-many-give-to-the-needy-in-memory-of-loved-ones.html","abstract":"  The letter, typed single space, overflows with details of a life well spent, a man beloved. It describes his career (art), his hobby (the Sunday crossword puzzle), even his bad habit (pipe smoking). Written in December, it was sent to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund with a donation honoring Joseph Hochfeld, a cherished grandfather who died 10 years ago.   Judith Remondi of North Quincy, Mass., who wrote the letter, is among hundreds of people who have contributed to the fund in memory of a relative. But the letter she sent with her $200 donation is rare in its dense detail. It fills two pages, recounting all the traits that endeared Mr. Hochfeld to his family.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"You Must Go Home Again; All Politics Is Local, Especially for Mike Forbes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/nyregion/you-must-go-home-again-all-politics-is-local-especially-for-mike-forbes.html","abstract":"  Heading to his third Saturday night dinner, Mike Forbes, a freshman Congressman, turned to his wife, Barbara, and asked, \"Honey, do we have any cereal at home?\"   He had passed on the barbecued chicken at a fund-raiser for a Suffolk County legislator, didn't touch the shrimp cocktail at a Southold Republican function and pushed some rigatoni around his plate at a party honoring Coram's volunteer fire department. He went home to a bowl of Raisin Bran and a few hours' sleep before rising to face two breakfasts and a brunch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New
