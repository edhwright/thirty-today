So when it was proposed that a replica of the only pirate ship ever salvaged in the United States be built here as the centerpiece of a $70 million pirate museum on a chunk of prime downtown waterfront, the idea seemed a perfect fit.   But before pirates hijacked the Whydah, which sank in 1717, it had been a slave ship, and when leaders of Tampa's black community learned of the vessel's full history late last year, they were outraged. The controversy has engulfed Tampa since then, not only threatening the project but reopening old wounds in a city with a long history of racial disputes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Review/Film; A Homeless Frenchwoman In America Sans Green Card","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/movies/review-film-a-homeless-frenchwoman-in-america-sans-green-card.html","abstract":"  \"Trusting Beatrice,\" which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is the sort of failed comedy that becomes increasingly difficult to watch as it proceeds.

For years, the label Shimmy-Disc has been an outlet for the far side of the New York music scene: bands so experimental they border on surreal, projects so avant-garde they're likely to disturb tame ears. Now, the people at Shimmy-Disc have started a new label, Kokopop, with an esthetic aimed at the more conventional side of the scene. Kokopop is fun; Kokopop is nutty; Kokopop is a word with only three different letters in it; Kokopop will potentially move more product. Tonight's party features five bands, including the jittery, grinding guitar band Jive Bible; Aenone and Dandelion Fire, which tend toward fuzz-based, droning guitar pop; Tiny Lights, veering between progressive-rock jams and dreamy ballads, and the slamming distortion of Morning Glories. Tonight at 9. Tickets are $8. Blues With Heart     Jimmy Dawkins Blues Band, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. The stereotype of the blues guitarist is a guy standing onstage with a pained expression on his face, his hands zooming up and down the neck as he squeezes out notes in a finger-tripping flurry of notes emphasizing flash and technique. Jimmy Dawkins, an unjustly obscure figure from Chicago, works the opposite end of the spectrum. Emotive and economical, he is more likely to turn his back on the crowd and stretch a taut note through several chords, and his solos have a gut-wrenching precision that eschews grandstanding. He resurrects the heart of the blues: its feelings, urgency and ultimate catharsis. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30. Tickets are $5. Malone in Overdrive     Michelle Malone, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. At her best, Michelle Malone is the kind of singer and songwriter who can jolt things into overdrive. Working a raunchy groove that borrows from the Allman Brothers and the Rolling Stones without keeling over into Black Crowes-style mimickry, she can push her band into a jiving, bluesy frenzy that's no less authentic for being derivative. On top of that, she has a wail that could stop an express train. Tomorrow at 8:30 P.M.; admission is $8.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/nyregion/inside-985293.html","abstract":"  Big Loss for General Motors   General Motors posted a $23.5 billion loss for 1992, the largest ever for an American corporation.

Le Chantilly is such a place, recently rejuvenated by an American talent at the stove, David Ruggerio, who displays maturity far beyond his 30 years.   For much of its recent life, Le Chantilly has been the kindly old aunt of New York's French restaurant family: dependable, cosseting, generous but not exactly a Mardi Gras parade in the excitement department. Mr. Ruggerio, a veteran of La Caravelle and Maxim's in Manhattan, seems determined to change all that.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"With Jeers for the West, Iran Cheers 14 Years of Revolution","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/world/with-jeers-for-the-west-iran-cheers-14-years-of-revolution.html","abstract":"  Hundreds of thousands of Iranians accompanied by battalions of the armed forces converged on Freedom Square in Teheran today in a Government-sponsored rally marking the day the military capitulated to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, bringing the fall of the monarchy 14 years ago.

The picture, which shows a model in a bathing suit and cloak running on the beach, was startling in an age when most fashion photographs were carefully staged confections shot in the studio. But it also suggested a new way of viewing women, as free and unabashedly physical.    By the time Munkacsi made this invigorating picture he was already well-known as a photojournalist in Berlin, working for the lively illustrated news magazines that thrived in Weimar Germany. A retrospective of his work, organized by the Aperture Foundation and now at the Fashion Institute of Technology, traces Munkacsi's career from his early work in Hungary to his final fashion shot, taken in 1962, of a model wearing a turban with long cloth ends that droop like a sad rabbit's ears.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/nyregion/no-headline-037093.html","abstract":"  I knew I could do it.

No, but Just As Psycho","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/arts/review-opera-old-movies-no-but-just-as-psycho.html","abstract":"  The modern horror film owes a lot to the mannerisms of turn-of-the-century Expressionism, to images of severed limbs and invocations of disordered minds, to sickly dread and syrupy moans. The most appropriate movie scores for such films are still written in a style that imitates the music of the period, in which the long, tonal musical lines once associated with Romantic desire twist upon themselves, splintering into fragments or drifting into disturbed disarray.    So it should not have been too surprising that when the Canadian director Robert Lepage brought his Canadian Opera Company productions of Bartok's \"Bluebeard's Castle\" and Schoenberg's \"Erwartung\" to the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night, there was no escaping the sense of cinematic cliche. In Mr. Lepage's staging of Schoenberg's monodrama -- a troubled, disoriented monologue by an unnamed woman -- there are languorous slow-motion sequences: an attack with a scythe, a naked body rolling into a stream of water, blood streaming from a corpse, a hand emerging out of a brick wall and grabbing its victim. There is even a white-suited psychiatrist with a pad, making notes as the woman's obsessions take shape. In Bartok's one-act opera, Mr. Lepage has given us a long dungeon corridor, huge doors with keyholes the size of severed heads, shimmering shadows cast by red light and a slow march of women through streams of blood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Board Splits Are Mirrored In Albany","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/nyregion/board-splits-are-mirrored-in-albany.html","abstract":"  The dismissal of Schools Chancellor Joseph A.

The bad Soviets have been replaced by the good Russians, so politicians no longer make self-regarding statements of outrage.

It was James Brazell who got the seventh graders interested in Flight 007. His speech to them was the third one on the subject he has given in the last year. As the horror and outrage over Flight 007 fades, the American attachment to the guest speaker, especially free ones like Mr. Brazell, keeps the 58-year-old professor of English plugging away at his lonely cause, which is the appalling conviction that the C.I.A. intentionally guided the Korean passenger airliner off course and over Soviet territory to test the enemy's air-defense reactions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Woman in the News: CLINTON PICKS MIAMI WOMAN, VETERAN STATE PROSECUTOR, TO BE HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL; Tough 'Front-Line Warrior' Janet Reno","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/us/woman-clinton-picks-miami-woman-veteran-state-prosecutor-be-his-attorney-general.html","abstract":"MIAMI, Feb. 11 As State Attorney for Dade County for 15 years, Janet Reno has grown accustomed to controversy and conflict.

The three-story Nancy and Jake Hamon Building was financed in part by a $20 million gift from Mrs. Hamon, the widow of Jake Hamon, a Dallas oil tycoon who died six years ago. Mrs. Hamon stipulated that the money go toward building a new wing rather than increasing the museum's endowment.   The addition was designed by the New York architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, who designed the museum's existing building in 1984. In addition to office and storage space, the wing provides 14,000 square feet for 7,000 American objects, including the museum's extensive assortment of Pre-Columbian gold. There will also be a 32,000-square-foot education center for the museum, half of whose visitors participate in some kind of educational program.   But with so many museums struggling just to survive, and the city of Dallas's having reduced its financial contributions to the museum, the new wing is viewed with some skepticism in the art world. But there are also those who believe the addition could help pull in potential donors.   \"It may seem brash from a distance but it's the classic Texas attitude,\" said Harry S. Parker 3d, a former director of the Dallas Museum who is now the director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. \"Texas has a long tradition of building real-estate projects on-the-come. And being leveraged is a part of the thinking.\" Against the Tide    Peter C. Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, said that while most museums were pulling in their horns, Dallas was acting aggressively. \"But sometimes going against the tide works,\" he said. \"The question is do they have sufficient money to operate?\"   Richard Brettell, a former director of the museum who is the consulting director for the Hamon expansion, said he was \"very sanguine about the museum's financial future.\" But he added, \"That's not to say it's going to be easy.\"   When the museum was founded 90 years ago, the city owned all the art as well as the building. When the museum moved to its new site in 1984 it established itself as a separate legal entity. The city of Dallas owns the present museum's buildings and what now amounts to about half its collection. While last year the city cut its funds to the museum by 17 percent, Dr. Brettell said that two years ago the city had extended for 20 years its contract to pay the museum's operating costs based on a percentage of the city-owned art, and that this new contract included the cost of operating the new addition. The city has also agreed to make a one-year increase of 50 percent in its financing to help with the opening year of the new addition.   \"We're building the addition to the city's specifications,\" Dr. Brettell said. \"But the city's collection will remain static and ours is growing, which means that over time the city will be giving less money.\" He said the museum hoped that income from its endowment would be able to cover the difference.  80% of FundsEighty Percent in Hand    The addition is part of a $55 million expansion. Meg Hanlon, who heads the museum's press office, said 80 percent of the funds had been raised.   The wing will become the centerpiece of a totally reorganized museum, housing what the institution calls its Museum of the Americas. In time, the remainder of the collection will be divided among a Museum of Europe, a Museum of African and Asian Art and a Museum of Contemporary Art. The philosophy behind the thematic reorganization reflects the museum's desire to be sensitive to its location, in a state that borders Mexico, and to put non-Western art on an equal footing with European art.   \"When we analyzed the collection we began thinking about making a definition for each building,\" Dr. Brettell said, \"so that rather than simply being a cultural maze, like most museums, ours will be organized into geographical and historical units.\"    On April 17, the institution will reopen a portion of the second and third floors of its existing building to house the Museum of Europe. The Museum of African and Asian Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art are to open in successive years, beginning in 1994. Dispute Over Picasso Print    A lawsuit is proceeding between two of the world's leading print experts: David P. Tunick, a Manhattan dealer, and Eberhard Kornfeld, the owner of Galerie Kornfeld, a well-respected auction house in Bern, Switzerland. Last week, Judge David N. Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan denied a request from Mr. Kornfeld to dismiss the case.   The court had ordered Mr. Kornfeld to produce by Feb. 1 documents relating to the Picasso print that is at the center of the dispute. Mr. Tunick's lawyer, William M. Barron of Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green in Manhattan, said Mr. Kornfeld had failed to do so. Now Judge Edelstein has ordered Mr. Kornfeld to appear in court next week for a deposition.    At the heart of the dispute are issues of authenticity and money. In June 1990, Mr. Tunick paid $1.68 million for an impression of Picasso's famous 1935 print \"The Minotauromachie\" at an auction at Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Mr. Barron says that at the time of the sale both men had agreed that Mr. Tunick would pay for the print in installments. The dealer exhibited the print at the annual Art Show in Manhattan in February 1991, where it was the centerpiece of his booth and was priced at $2 million. The work failed to sell at the show. Offer of an Exchange    Sixteen months after his purchase, and eight months after the Art Show, Mr. Tunick said experts who had seen the signature questioned its authenticity. Mr. Kornfeld, a Picasso expert himself, insists the work is genuine. He offered to exchange it for a copy of the same print in his private collection that had once belonged to Nelson Rockefeller and had for years been on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Mr. Tunick refused to make the swap.   \"He refused the offer when he heard he would have to pay in 30 days,\" said Mr. Kornfeld in a telephone interview earlier this week. \"He said it would not be possible.\"    Last October, nine days after Mr. Tunick said he discovered that the print's signature was fake, he filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, citing fraud, misrepresentation, breach of duty, honesty and good faith in fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. He asked for his money back -- the $426,254 paid in cash as well as artwork he consigned to the Swiss auction house valued at $974,000 -- and punitive damages of $20 million.   At the end of November, Mr. Kornfeld filed a lawsuit in Switzerland for the money he was still owed. Two months ago the case was thrown out of the Swiss courts on jurisdictional grounds, a decision Mr. Kornfeld is appealing. Change of Venue Denied    Judge Edelstein ruled that the case is to proceed in New York because the disputed print is here, as are the several experts who believe the signature is a forgery. In a pretrial motion, Mr. Kornfeld maintained that the dispute should be heard in Switzerland because he is a Swiss citizen and because his auction house had specified that any court proceedings must take place in Bern. The judge denied the motion to dismiss the case.   Faxes that went back and forth between the two men for 15 months reflect, for the most part, a verbal tug of war concerning the payment. In one fax, dated July 24, 1991, and submitted to the court, Mr. Tunick wrote to Mr. Kornfeld: \"While we see some signs of business beginning to turn around, our cash position remains difficult for now, and we simply are not able to continue with any sort of payment schedule at the moment.\"   Mr. Barron, Mr. Tunick's lawyer, said, \"This was the beginning of the worst part of the recession and Tunick simply could not divert monies and change his business plans to accommodate Kornfeld.\" The lawyer added that \"as of the time David discovered the forgery he had paid $1.4 million in monies and in kind, so that his ability to pay simply cannot be questioned.\"   Mr. Barron said that Mr. Kornfeld changed the terms of the deal, at first agreeing to accept extended payment but then wanting money immediately. A Different Estimate    Matthew C. Kesten, a lawyer with Kantor, Davidoff, Wolfe, Rabbino & Kass in Manhattan, who is representing Mr. Kornfeld, said Mr. Tunick's payments do not add up to $1.4 million. So far, Mr. Tunick has made three cash payments totaling $350,000, according to documents filed with the court. He has also consigned six prints to Mr. Kornfeld to auction, two of which, Mr. Kesten said, have been sold for a total of about $29,000. Mr. Kesten estimates this leaves a balance of $1.3 million.    Among the prints Mr. Tunick sent to Mr. Kornfeld was Edvard Munch's \"Madonna.\" According to court documents, Mr. Kornfeld put the print up for sale and his firm's published sales results indicated that it sold for about $500,000. But after questioning in court, Mr. Kornfeld admitted that the piece had in fact not been sold at all. \"Mr. Kornfeld published the highest bid, he never said the print had sold,\" said Mr. Kesten.   Mr. Barron said: \"Mr. Kornfeld has been struggling to avoid taking the case to trial in New York. He has lost in Bern and here. This case will now proceed with pre-trial discovery and we hope for a prompt trial, where Mr. Tunick will prevail and very likely recover substantial punitive damages.\"    Mr. Kesten sees things differently: \"If we are ultimately allowed by the judge to get to the merits of the case, I think we will be able to show that the signature is correct. The piece was only questioned 16 months after Tunick bought it and conceded that he could not pay for it.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"When Career Women Need to Stop the Clock","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/opinion/l-when-career-women-need-to-stop-the-clock-933593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As the father of a daughter who is a graduate student in psychology, I read Shirley M.

This is an especially good time to consider such an outing, as many schoolchildren start their winter break this weekend and February's crisp temperatures keep the slopes crunchy even when the snow is artificial. Here are two ski areas -- one large, one small -- that make children feel welcome. Vernon Valley-Great Gorge Route 94  McAfee Sussex County  Sussex County  (201) 827-2000 or 827-3900    THE RESORT: Great Gorge came first, in 1965; Vernon Valley, next door, opened in 1967. They merged in 1977 and developed a summer resort called Action Park a year later. With a vertical drop of 1,040 feet, Great Gorge-Vernon Valley has three mountains with 52 interconnecting trails, rated from beginner to expert; 17 lifts, including three rope tows on two bunny slopes; snow-making machines; night skiing; a spa; two base lodges, lodging and restaurants.   THE BUNNY SLOPES: Among very young children, perhaps 3 to 6 years old, the Chicken Little slope is a perfect inducement for the nervous and wary. (The other bunny hill, Lion's Den, is comparable.) Though not too steep, the slope is steep enough for children to be challenged, and it is wide enough to accommodate a large number of skiers with little or no experience. There are two rope tows; when group lessons are taught on one side of the slope, one of the two is shuts down. (Children often think the rope tow is the best part of skiing.) On Sunday, many parents were putting their first-time skiers between their legs and going downhill; others enticed them to ski a few feet into the safety of a parent's arms. Most of the children had no poles, and few were heard whining or crying. They were thrilled.   LESSONS: On holidays and weekends, the resort offers two children's packages for those 3 to 12 years old that offer a blend of skiing and other activities like craft-making and baking. The cost is $32 for a half day or $45 for a full day, including lifts, but equipment rental costs $10 extra. There are also daily group classes whose price ($44 for children 5 years old and up; $51 for adults) includes lift tickets to the beginner slopes and equipment rental.   THE WAIT: We thought we were clever to choose Super Bowl Sunday for an outing, but Vernon Valley was still a popular destination. Waits for some chairlifts lasted about 15 minutes; others were shorter. The rope-tow line at Chicken Little moved quickly when there were no stumbling bodies.   SUSTENANCE: Vernon Valley has three restaurants: one upstairs with views of the mountain, serving fare like chili and burgers; one below, specializing in pizza, video games and adolescents, and one upstairs with a bar and a more sophisticated atmosphere. Smoking is allowed. (There are other restaurants at the Great Gorge area of the resort.)   THE MOOD: This is the Jones Beach of ski resorts; it's not a mecca for the cultural elite and doesn't pretend to be. The surrounding landscape is eclectic, but from the top of the mountain the view is spectacular. It is an easy drive along Route 80 from the New York City area, without too much traffic. The resort attracts a large number of eager beavers, boisterous families and audacious first-timers.   THE COST: Adult lift tickets: $36 for a day (8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.); $26 for a half-day (1 to 5 P.M.); $32 for twilight (3 to 10 P.M.); $26 for night (6 to 10 P.M.); $51 for a learn-to-ski package with limited lift ticket, rentals and group lesson. Children's lift tickets (ages 5 to 12; anyone younger enters free): $29 a day; $22 a half-day; $27 for twilight; $22 for night; $44 for a learn-to-ski package. Rentals: adult skis, boots and poles, $21.50; junior skis, boots and poles, $16.50; snowboards (skateboards without the wheels), $26.50.   HOURS: Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Fridays, 9 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Sundays, 8:30 to 10 P.M. Through March 31. Craigmeur Ski Area Green Pond Road (off Route 23) Newfoundland Morris County (201) 697-4500    THE RESORT: Craigmeur, in rural New Jersey near Stockholm and Lake Telemark, was opened in 1937 by Hugo Muiry, an Austrian immigrant. Devoted to beginners, Craigmeur, with a 300-foot drop, is not ashamed of its small size and mild-mannered slopes. It offers four slopes, three for beginners and one intermediate; a chairlift, T-bar and two rope tows; night skiing, cross-country trails (which may be closed if there is a lack of snow), snow-making machines for the slopes and a cafeteria. Lodging is available nearby.   THE BUNNY SLOPES: On one very wide hill with gentle bumps and relatively stable stretches, lots of parents were towing children downhill by hand, harness or pole. Some parents were on the slope without skis, coaching their children on skis. The two rope tows were not running (the management said it operates them when the slopes become crowded), so the real challenge was riding back up on the T-bar or the chairlift.   LESSONS: The Humpty Dumpty class, for 3-to-6-year-olds, lasts about 45 minutes; the children stretch, bend their knees, ski through a row of poles and learn to stop, all without poles. There was noticeable improvement by the end, and parents had their camcorders running. Humpty Dumpty classes, including equipment rental, lifts and the lesson, cost $20 on weekdays and $28 on weekends. The Ski Eagles class, for children 5 to 12 years old, includes lunch and costs $45 for a full day and $25 for a half day. Rentals are extra: $10 for a full day, $6 for a half-day. Ski Friend is another program, in which parents may hire a teen-ager to ski with a child for $12 an hour.   THE WAIT: Short, although the large number of beginners means there are many brief shutdowns as novices gather themselves up after falling off the T-bar or recover from descending off the chair lift.   SUSTENANCE: The food is acceptable, but you might prefer to pack a picnic lunch. The top-of-the-mountain restaurant has picture windows overlooking the Copperas Mountains and offers a close-up view of people getting off the T-bar (which one child called \"the hook\"). Polyurethaned wooden picnic tables indoors give the restaurant a rustic feeling and make it easy to spend the afternoon reading while others ski. Smoking is allowed.   THE MOOD: Family, family, family. Here parents may rediscover why they had children as everyone basks in the low-key atmosphere, surrounded by other beginners. The resort is not difficult to find driving on Route 80 from the New York City area.   THE COSTS: Full-day lift tickets: $26 for adults; $22 for juniors, children aged 7 to 12; $12 for children 6 and under. Half-day (8:30 to 1 P.M. or 1:30 to 5 P.M.): $20 for adults; $17 for juniors; $12 for children. Twilight (3 to 10 P.M.): $26 for adults; $20 for juniors; $12 for children. Night (5 to 10 P.M.): $20 for adults and juniors; $12 for children. Rental of skis, boots and poles: adults, $17; children 6 and under, $12. Snowboards: $18.   HOURS: Mondays through Fridays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Sundays, 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Through March 31.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930212","headline":"Teacher Is Arrested On Heroin Charge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/nyregion/teacher-is-arrested-on-heroin-charge.html","abstract":"  A fifth-grade teacher in the Bronx who the authorities said would leave work on her lunch break to buy heroin was arrested yesterday on a drug charge.

Early revolutionists condemned this strange, sensual music as unhealthy: the product of severe neurosis, tainted mysticism, delusions of grandeur and overactive glandular response. The evidence was fairly good, especially in piano pieces like \"Vers la Flamme,\" a shuddering little exercise in erotic helplessness in which the circling moth is drawn fatally toward heat and light. Scriabin, thought the Politburo, was hardly music to inspire tool-and-die workers toward new production goals.   Things changed, both in the idea of Scriabin's music and the way it was played. Refiltered through proper channels, pieces like the \"Poem of Ecstasy\" -- which Valery Gergiyev and the New York Philharmonic brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night -- became more like a \"Poem of Youthful Aspiration.\" The tugging, nagging melodic lines, the sensation of ooze, the ecstatic trumpet proclamations suddenly assumed broad shoulders and a squarer cut in performance. Scriabin in his madness thought that if only he skipped and gamboled at a slightly accelerated pace, he would fly through the air. The Soviets, correspondingly, made him a symbol of their heroic cosmonauts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930213","headline":"Hartford Schools Molded by Racial Isolation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/13/nyregion/hartford-schools-molded-by-racial-isolation.html","abstract":"  Hartford Public High School's principal, Amado Cruz, reflected on the different worlds of his 2,200 students.

Not even a brawl that left three Penguins and one Blackhawk ejected and halted the first period with 51 seconds remaining could stop Pittsburgh from beating Chicago at home for the first time since Dec. 6, 1988.

(AP) SKIING Giant Slalom to German Katja Seizinger of Germany won the women's super giant slalom today in Shizukuishi, Japan, the final day of competition in the World Alpine Ski Championships. Seizinger, the World Cup downhill champion, covered the 1.35-mile Mount Kotakakura course in 1 minute 33.52 seconds to deflate the hopes of Austrian veteran Sylvia Eder. Eder, whose sister, Elfi, won a bronze medal in the women's slalom, got the super-G silver in 1:33.68. Astrid Loedemel got the bronze in 1:34.07, giving Norway its seventh medal of these ski games, one behind Austria. Norway still led with three golds to two for Germany, which got the first of this competition when Miriam Vogt won the women's combined.   The women's super-G was perhaps the most critical event of the championships. The start was pushed back 90 minutes by wind and blowing snow, and further delays would have imperiled the men's super-G, to be run on the same mountain three hours later.   On Saturday, Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway won the slalom for his third medal of the competition. He has won two golds and one silver in three races, making him the runaway big winner in the world championships. If the weather would cooperate, Aamodt had a shot at another medal today in the super giant slalom, the event in which he is Olympic champion. (AP) BOBSLED RACING Swiss Lead 4-Man Gustav Weder drove Switzerland's No. 2 sled into the lead halfway through the four-man bobsled World Championships in Igls, Austria, by posting the fastest times in both runs yesterday.   Weder, who finished second in last weekend's two-man bobsled race, had a combined time of 1 minute 43.84 seconds. Austria's No. 1 sled, driven by Hubert Schoesser, finished the day in second place with a 1:44.06 clocking. The United States' No. 1 sled, driven by Brian Shimer of Naples, Fla., and the No. 2 German sled, with Harald Czudaj at the helm, tied for third place in 1:44.15. The final two-runs in the two-day event are scheduled for today on the Igls course, just outside of Innsbruck. (AP) TENNIS Seles-Navratilova Final  Monica Seles lived up to her No. 1 world ranking yesterday with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Mary Joe Fernandez in the semifinals of the Chicago Slims tournament. Today, Seles will face Martina Navratilova for the $75,000 first prize in the $350,000 tourney. Navratilova defeated Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-0, 4-6, 6-1, in the other semifinal. \"Against Seles, you have to earn every point,\" Fernandez said. \"Since she's been No. 1, she been just about unbeatable.

Sergi Bruguera of Spain rallied from a second-set rout and a 3-0 deficit in the third to upset third-seeded Petr Korda, 6-4, 0-6, 7-5, in the first semifinal. (AP) GOLF Hill Leads Seniors by 6  Mike Hill shot a sevenn-under-par 65 to take a six-shot lead yesterday after two rounds of the Challenge, a Senior PGA tournament in Naples, Fla. Hill holed a 75-foot putt on the 490-yard par-5 10th hole for an eagle. His hot round also included six birdies and a bogey. He birdied the 18th by hitting a 5-iron within 15 feet of the pin. Dave Stockton, the first-round co-leader, fell off the pace with a 71 to put him in the pack at six under with Gibby Gilbert, Jim Dent, Larry Gilbert and Mike Joyce.

On one night we had the duck hot with vegetables, and the following day we served the leftover meat with a frisee salad.    Duck breast salad makes an excellent first course, light supper or lunch dish, and it is at its best when the greens are chilled and the duck is still warm.

They are the counterparts of their better known and more touristic cousins in the heights above Nice: St.-Paul de Vence, Vence, Tourrettes-sur-Loup. Built in the Middle Ages, with a history dating back before Jesus, they have names like Seillans, Bargemon, Fayence, Callian, Figanieres. Some of their sinuous lanes, most of them closed to cars, are barely wide enough for two people to walk side by side. Still paved with their original cobblestones with a middle gutter for the rainwater, they twist and sharply climb the slopes of the rock on which they cling. Hiding behind their ramparts, the villages, built to fend off the attacks of the dreaded Moors, strangely evoke the medinas of Morocco. Most have kept their 10th- or 11th-century castles intact, with a chemin de ronde still circling under the ramparts.   Of course, this region has been discovered, mostly by English lovers of Haute-Provence, and Scandinavians and Belgians keeping their secret quiet. They have bought the medieval village houses and castles and renovated them into three- or four-story vacation homes full of character, with breathtaking views over the surrounding mountains. Fayence, Seillans and Bargemon have been partly gentrified, yet they are still deeply Provencal, involved in the production of olive oil (cold-pressed, the best you'll find in the South of France), essential oils from jasmine and lavender, and the famous Rose de Provence, which you can taste and buy at the vineyards in the surrounding valleys. If you time your visit in late winter or early spring, when the mimosa blossoms burst into a vibrant yellow along the quiet roads, you will catch a glimpse of an authentic Provence the summer tourist can barely see.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Real Incest and Real Survivors: Readers Respond","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/books/l-real-incest-and-real-survivors-readers-respond-621793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Frequently incest survivors, like war veterans and torture victims, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. One of the symptoms of this syndrome is the obliteration of the memory of the trauma. This repression is actually a coping mechanism that allows children to survive the terror of their past. Dennis Charney, a neuroscientist, found that trauma actually alters the chemistry of the brain. Studies report that the average age of remembering childhood incest is between 29 and 49. It is for this reason that the statute of limitations for reporting abuse was extended in Washington State.   \"Is such legislation warranted?\" Carol Tavris asks. Many critics of our legal system believe we do more to protect the accused than the victims. According to an article written by Heidi Vanderbilt for Lear's magazine, eight of our states have no incest statutes. Twenty-seven states deem vaginal penetration necessary for incest to have occurred. Thus a father who sodomizes his child or forces him or her to perform fellatio would not meet the legal definition of incest.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Denise Brine, F.

Headlining a benefit concert for reproductive rights, Donita Sparks of the all-female group L7 curls her lip, carves out a guitar riff and snarls into the mike: \"Get out of my way or I might shove.\" Courtney Love stares boldly from a photograph in Spin magazine, baby to breast, her ratty hair and decidedly un-Barbie-like body breaking the dictums of feminine convention. Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill gives the microphone to a girl in the audience at a show, and the fan pours out her own stories of abuse and escape.   Female rebellion has challenged rock's fraternal order since the beginning; some women have always insisted they would rather play than be playthings. But today women, especially on the alternative rock scene, have entered a new phase of awareness and determination. The reproductive rights movement in rock, spearheaded by L7 and the organization Rock for Choice, grew to national proportion in the last year. Now female rockers are beginning to extend that activism into the realm of identity politics, with groups like the Bohemian Women's Political Alliance and youth subcultures like riot grrrls.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"In Williamsburg, Prince Completes a Royal Circle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/us/in-williamsburg-prince-completes-a-royal-circle.html","abstract":"  For a Valentine's Day prelude, the spectacle was bittersweet.

Volume One: The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790), by Nicholas Boyle. (Oxford University, $17.95.) During the years Nicholas Boyle examines, Goethe proved himself a multifaceted genius -- he became not only a writer but also an artist, scientist and public administrator. This first volume of a two-part biography is \"replete with penetrating insights and unsurpassed in thoroughness,\" Christoph Schweitzer said here in 1991. There is, he added, \"nothing comparable to this study in any language.\"     SUGAR STREET: The Cairo Trilogy III, by Naguib Mahfouz. Translated by William Maynard Hutchins and Angele Botros Samaan. (Anchor/Doubleday, $11.) The third volume in this Nobel laureate's trilogy continues the story of the family of al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, a Cairo patriarch. In this novel, first published in Arabic in 1957, al-Sayyid Ahmad, a symbol of the old Egypt, has grown elderly and embittered; it is up to his grandchildren's generation to shape a new and independent nation. Last year our reviewer, Ammiel Alcalay, said: \"The ordinary nature of Mr. Mahfouz's world, with its willingness to confront the complexities of human intentions, makes it an extraordinary exception in a marketplace of manufactured ideas and is, for that, all the more admirable.\" Anchor/Doubleday has also issued a new paperback edition of Mr. Mahfouz's 1967 novel MIRAMAR, translated by Fatma Moussa Mahmoud, edited and revised by Maged el Kommos and John Rodenbeck ($8.50). Set in Alexandria, it traces the interwoven relationships of the residents of the Pension Miramar, whose lives are thrown into upheaval by a young servant girl.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Hilo and the Hula","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/travel/l-hilo-and-the-hula-464893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Lenore Magida's article, \"In Search of the Real Hula\" (Dec. 27), certainly points up the need for all current and future Americans to try to perpetuate the various cultural aspects of this country's rich diversity. .

Some like the ordinary so as to feel reaffirmed and \"at home,\" and some seek the extraordinary, those daring distortions of realism that, by stunning verbal feats, hurtle the reader to fantastic latitudes. There is, however, just that element of strain when the conscious and not the unconscious is seen to be pulling the strings. Magic, as I see it, is simple eeriness, as in, say, \"The Snow Queen,\" when Gerda asks the forest raven where her friend has gone and he replies, \"I'll tell you . . . but if only you understood raven speech I could tell you better\"; or in the enchanted stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer, in which New York is often fleetingly transformed into an exile's dreamland; or in Kafka's work, in which the ordinary glides inexorably into the gilded labyrinths of nightmare.\n\nSome read to laugh, and let it be hoped some still read to cry, so that on finishing \"Bleak House\" they realize more fully than from any formal education the perversity, torpidity and mindless callousness of humankind. Some choose to enter the dark chambers of the psyche and reread Dostoyevsky, not so much to feel at home as to become guests to the criminal within themselves. Some like to sample the nausea of life, man's fate reduced to the absurd by writers who curse God, like Samuel Beckett. That author once put it to me that my return to my native land, both in fiction and in person, was to imbibe another dose of disgust. I could not agree, no more than I would agree that absurdity is Beckett's prime agenda. Rather, I would say it is a hectic delirium that inclines toward the profane but always ends on a note of liturgical grace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930214","headline":"Berliners Object to Doubts Over New Capital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/world/berliners-object-to-doubts-over-new-capital.html","abstract":"  Berlin officials are complaining that continued debate over this city's future as the German capital is upsetting potential investors and hindering the process of national unification.

If there is a unifying undercurrent, it is McCartney's determination to have his work reconsidered. It's no secret that he was disappointed by the failure of his last studio outing, \"Flowers in the Dirt\" in 1989, to reach the top of the charts, despite critical enthusiasm and a world tour that broke attendance records.

When a foreign film is remade to suit American audiences, its new version inevitably reflects some perception, fair or otherwise, of American tastes. We are seldom forced to contemplate those tastes as bluntly as we are by \"Sommersby,\" a post-Civil War version of \"The Return of Martin Guerre\" (1982), and \"The Vanishing,\" a Hollywood remake of the identically titled 1991 Dutch thriller. If we set out to commission a collective self-portrait, we would surely want something a bit more flattering.   The contrasts between these new films and their European predecessors are particularly fascinating because the originals are so quietly contemplative (and so good).

It is fun to browse through the more than 350 photographs of now-familiar celebrities as they looked 20, 30 or 40 years ago.

The magic simply cannot be recaptured.
