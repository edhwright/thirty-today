The spice blends can be as simple as roasted cumin seeds combined with salt and pepper, or as complex as a garam masala from India, which may contain a dozen or more spices.

Details and close-ups would seem inimical to the sweep and grandeur of Balanchine's choreography, with its sophisticated use of pattern and structure. Yet the newly released film, which is based on his 1954 production of \"The Nutcracker,\" embodies a marriage of art forms that Balanchine once envisaged.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931201","headline":"1893: Execution in Paris : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/01/opinion/IHT-1893-execution-in-paris-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - Küntz, a young man known as the \"murderer of rue Berthe,\" will be no more by the time the Herald reader unfolds his paper this morning [Dec. 1].

Flinter, conducted in April and May, discovered during random checks at all terminals that only 46 percent of 305 trains left on time, meaning they departed within a 45-second window when a green light signaled for them to go. By contrast, the Transit Authority records for 1992 showed that 96 percent of trains started their trips on time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931203","headline":"Defensive Driver?

Upstairs, brightly colored scribblings on the wall strongly indicate a nursery school or a kindergarten. But now there are strange, dangerous noises coming from behind a second door.

It's either an uplifting or depressing story, depending on whether you view it as an example of perseverance rewarded or as an example of how stacked the odds are against the financial success of a Broadway musical. On Nov. 15, after 725 performances and 91 weeks at the Shubert Theater, \"Crazy for You,\" the reconstituted Gershwin musical, finally earned back the $8.3 million its investors pumped into it. The specific records aren't kept anywhere, but according to some of Broadway's most reliable memories, perhaps only \"Grand Hotel,\" which took exactly two years, has recouped its investment on Broadway over a longer span. (Many shows, of course, have run longer, but they either broke into profit sooner -- \"Miss Saigon,\" for instance, recouped a $10 million investment after 39 weeks -- or, in a few cases, like the $7.5 million \"Will Rogers Follies,\" never did.)    Even for a Tony-winner like \"Crazy for You,\" this is the official crossing of the line from flop to hit, so let's call it uplifting. Anyway, the show has performed well all along, weekly filling more than 80 percent of the Shubert's 1,465 seats and often earning $450,000 or more a week. There is currently a $3.5 million advance. The reason recoupment has taken so long, said Roger Horchow, one of the show's producers (his partner is Elizabeth Williams), is that its running expenses are high -- about $375,000 a week -- and that even though larger theaters were available, the producers insisted on the Shubert because its old-style ambiance complemented the Gershwinian spirit of the show, which is an adaptation of the Gershwins' 1930 opus, \"Girl Crazy.\" So the producers knew it would take an extended run to get their money back and decided to go ahead, anyway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931203","headline":"No More Scot-Free Scofflaws","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/03/opinion/no-more-scot-free-scofflaws.html","abstract":"  At long last, Washington has agreed to recognize the sovereign right of New York City to ticket and collect fines on illegally parked cars with diplomatic license plates.

The old O'Neal's Baloon, at 44 West 63d Street, across the street from Lincoln Center, has been transformed with shades of gold, burgundy and apricot by Jordan Mozer, an architect based in Chicago who never puts a straight edge where he can throw a curve. He designed Vivere in Chicago, Cypress Club in San Francisco and Americas in Houston as well as some of the furniture in Mad. 61 in the new Barneys on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. But Iridium, opening next week, is his first major project in New York City.   The theme of the design is music and dance.

Six days a week, the miners descend into a hole in the earth with pickaxes and baskets to chip away sulphur. Because of the intense heat they work nearly naked, in yellowish-brown lantern light that turns them into gleaming penitents out of Dante's Inferno.   Sustenance is meager, and an olive or an almond is considered a treat. At night the workers sleep in a cave, sprawled over one another like sweating animals. Sodomy is rampant.    The Italian film, which is having its American premiere today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, tells the story of Acla (Francesco Cusimano), an 11-year-old boy whose father sells him to a fellow digger for 500 lira. Working in the mine is a family tradition; Acla's father and brother have spent their lives in the pits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931203","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/03/arts/art-in-review-882193.html","abstract":"  Barbara Morgan   Laurence Miller Gallery  138 Spring Street  SoHo  Through Dec. 30    Barbara Morgan, who died last year at the age of 92, pursued many photographic themes in her long and distinguished career, and to do justice to the full range of her work would require more space than the gallery allows.

All are visited during the presentation, which uses mime, movement and narration, as well as song, to dramatize various cultures' stories and poems. (If you miss the show tomorrow, the ensemble is also to be performed in Manhattan in late December at Theater Four in Clinton.)   Among the folk tales is \"The Monkey Who Asked for Misery,\" a Haitian story in which an unfortunate ape sees a woman drop a calabash of honey on her way home from the market. After the woman curses the gods for her misery and goes on her way, the monkey samples the sweet stuff and says, \"Mmm, I want misery.\" Of course, he gets his wish. The traditional interpretation is that the tale warns against wanting something too much; perhaps a contemporary interpretation is that it's a good idea to learn the meaning of a word before you use it.   The poetry selections include Edgar Allan Poe's \"Raven\" and Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" as well as rhythmic favorites by Dr. Seuss. Children should be prepared to yell as well as look and listen. They will be asked to play both villain and heroes in the chorus of \"The True Story of the Three Little Pigs.\" They will also be given a copy of \"The Story of the Nutcracker Ballet.\"   Tickets to the 2 P.M. show, which lasts just over an hour, are $6; $5 for children under 12.

Kendall Gill and Gary Payton had 18 points apiece for the SuperSonics, who have the second-best record in the National Basketball Association at 12-1. Detlef Schrempf added 17 points. (AP) Suns 102, Pistons 101: In Auburn Hills, Mich., A. C. Green scored 10 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter and Phoenix held on for the victory over Detroit, sending the Pistons to their fifth straight loss. Isiah Thomas returned to the Pistons after missing seven games with a broken bone in his right hand. (AP) Jazz 103, Pacers 87: Jeff Malone scored 27 points and Karl Malone added 25 points and 18 rebounds as Utah defeated Indiana in Salt Lake City. Utah used a 15-0 run in the third quarter to overcome a 4-point Indiana lead and go in front by 74-63 with 1:01 left. The Pacers never got closer than 7 points after that.

The Leafs raised their road record to 10-3-3. That's nearly as good as their 9-2-1 record at Maple Leaf Gardens. (AP) COLLEGE BASKETBALL Arkansas Romps  Scotty Thurman scored 10 points and Clint McDaniel made consecutive 3-pointers during a 27-6 first-half run that helped Arkansas to a 120-68 victory over Missouri in Fayetteville, Ark. The Tigers (1-1) trailed by 23 at the half and by 40 with slightly more than 8 minutes to play. The spurt by Arkansas (2-0) began after Chris Heller missed a chance to tie the game at 11-11. Ten minutes later, Arkansas was in front by 38-15. (AP) Oklahoma State 87, Arizona State 69: Bryant Reeves dominated beneath the basket and scored a career-high 34 points last night to lead No. 8 Oklahoma State over Arizona State in Tulsa, Okla.

Jinyi Le erased a record set by Franziska van Almsick of Germany in the 100-meter free style, swimming a time of 53.01. The previous record, set in 1992, was 53.33. The other Chinese record came in the 800-meter freestyle relay with a time of 7:52.45, topping a mark of 7:58.74 set by the United States in 1981.
