Think of the irresistible passion of Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's recent \"Bram Stoker's 'Dracula,' \" or the smooth-talking manner of Frank Langella in the stage and screen versions of \"Dracula\" from the late 1970's. Even Bela Lugosi's classic count looked like nothing more than a 1930's Latin lover shipped to Transylvania. They are suave seducers, able to steal a woman's soul and body with a neat prick to the neck. (Female vampires have not been so successful on screen; \"Innocent Blood,\" with Anne Parillaud as the vampire who seduced Pittsburgh, and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" were among last year's conspicuous flops.)   Vampires have not always been so appealing. The first major movie Dracula, and still the one most capable of producing nightmares, appears in F. W. Murnau's 1922 silent film, \"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\" As Nosferatu (or the Undead), Max Schreck looks positively ratlike. He has a bald head, pointy ears, elongated hands with clawlike nails and two conspicuous fangs where his front teeth should be.

The play (at the American Jewish Theater) never probes deeply into these issues, and by rerunning parallel scenes it takes too long to arrive at its tentative conclusion. \"Another Time\" needs tightening, but it is written with the theatricality and the humor that one expects from the author of \"The Dresser.\" Under the direction of Stanley Brechner, an exceptional cast headed by Malcolm McDowell, Joan Copeland and Marian Seldes offers a finely tuned production.

Unlike most other species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the owl covers a much larger geographic range, strectching from southern British Columbia, Canada, to Marin County, Calif.

For years, 57th Street has been a mecca not simply for fashion, but also for art and antiques. Now it seems that high-end fashion designers like Chanel have the financial muscle to ease out the antiques shops.   Take 15 East 57th Street, where James Robinson's windows have attracted passers-by with striking displays of silver and jewelry for 14 years. The building, filled with distinguished antiques dealers, has been something of an institution on 57th Street. It is also home to Israel Sack, the American antiques dealer; Doris Leslie Blau, who specializes in antique rugs, and James II, a shop for small, predominantly English decorative objects. But Malcolm Franklin, an English furniture dealer, moved out of the building in June, and last month so did Paul Vandekar, whose stock of antique ceramics at Earle D. Vandekar of Knightsbridge occupied the building's second floor for 13 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930402","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/arts/art-in-review-073193.html","abstract":"  George McNeil   New York Studio School  8 West Eighth Street  Greenwich Village  Through May 2    To say that George McNeil's art is spectacularly gaudy is genuinely to praise it, although the aggressiveness that he has long cultivated no doubt partly accounts for his limited public reputation.

Roosevelt into its place of honor at the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, which is in the Bronx. Nobody came by to mark the moment, though a student couple necking a few niches down between Daniel Webster and John Quincy Adams occasionally looked up.   Actually, Roosevelt was voted into the hall in 1973, four years before the last elections for membership into what was established in 1901 as America's Pantheon. For 60 years it was taken seriously, drawing tourists like an urban Mount Rushmore, and generating national news coverage and debate for its elections. Now, like Ozymandias, it has outlived its glory; its proverbial 15 minutes. An unattended shrine, it is less visited and much less known than the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown or similar parochial temples of homage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930403","headline":"Market Bears Growl That the End Is Nigh","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/03/your-money/IHT-market-bears-growl-that-the-end-is-nigh.html","abstract":"IT CAN be lonely waiting for chickens to come home to roost, all the more so when their time away from the coop stretches on past five years.

The spending limit on foster care, believed to be the first in the nation, was introduced last year to limit the total the state will pay for foster care to $406 million. It is being praised as an innovative approach to containing costs by the Cuomo administration, which has proposed extending the cap on costs to the State Division for Youth, whose clients are emotionally troubled and delinquent youngsters. Questions About Quality of Care    Suffolk County officials say that the savings are a sign of success, but child-welfare advocates say that limiting state financing for foster care can discourage counties from removing children from dangerous or neglectful homes. Of the $6 million in incentives the Cuomo administration will pay counties for containing costs last year, $2 million will go to Suffolk County, where the county's treatment of 10-year-old Katie Beers has prompted questions about the quality of child protective services.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930403","headline":"Olajuwon Is U.S. Citizen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/03/sports/sports-people-basketball-olajuwon-is-us-citizen.html","abstract":"  Rockets star HAKEEM OLAJUWON stopped off at Federal court in Houston on his way to the basketball court yesterday morning and was sworn in as a new United States citizen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930403","headline":"BRIEFCASE: Newsletter-Touted Stocks Perform Well, Survey Finds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/03/your-money/IHT-briefcase-newslettertouted-stocks-perform-well-survey-finds.html","abstract":"Do stocks recommended most by advisory services outperform the market?

Another day, when those same representatives of government remember that they \"owe you not their industry only, but also their judgment\" and that judgment dares to differ from Mr. Amper's opinions, he castigates them all in your newspaper with his own kind of cynicism and arrogance. \" 'Government leaders,' \" he writes, \"has always been an oxymoron.\" One wonders if Amper has ever heard of Abraham Lincoln. How dare he? He spouts about other \"special interests,\" which are, of course, all bad. But how about his special-interest group. Not everyone agrees with them, either? Yet, his special interests are acceptable. The others are not.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Growing Numbers Seek Out Alternative Medicine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/nyregion/growing-numbers-seek-out-alternative-medicine.html","abstract":"For four years Lilia Telberg complained to her doctors about unrelenting fatigue.

Mitchell struck out Babe Ruth on four pitches, then Lou Gehrig on three. Mitchell's feat is little remembered; even less remembered is that the remarkable pitcher was a woman. Such a fate has been all too common, Barbara Gregorich observes in WOMEN AT PLAY: The Story of Women in Baseball (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, paper, $14.95). Women have been playing the sport since students at Vassar College formed two teams in 1866. Two decades after professional baseball began in 1869, women formed \"base ball clubs,\" nicknamed the Bloomer Girls. For the next 40 years, these teams barnstormed across the United States, playing men's semiprofessional and minor league teams in exhibition games. The teams were a victim of the Depression, Ms. Gregorich writes, as women were pushed into softball, \"a game significantly less expensive and less difficult to play.\" During World War II, Philip K. Wrigley organized the All-American Girls Baseball League, which inspired the recent movie \"A League of Their Own\"; the league lasted 12 seasons, until 1954. The book concludes with profiles of two women who attempted unsuccessfully to become major league umpires, Bernice Gera and Pam Postema. Ms. Gregorich has written a novel about baseball, \"She's on First,\" but her writing here is frequently wooden. Nevertheless, she is to be commended for bringing out of obscurity such baseball pioneers as Maud Nelson, Lizzie Arlington, Amanda Clement and Alta Weiss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Mother Is Accused Of Scalding Son, 10","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/nyregion/mother-is-accused-of-scalding-son-10.html","abstract":"  A Bronx mother frustrated by her 10-year-old son's performance at school disciplined him by stabbing him in the hand and scalding him with water on the arms and back, the police said yesterday.

Tree farming; the process of developing and raising trees for their ability to meet various human needs. Forests created by silviculture often feature one type of tree (monoculture), and thus attract a limited variety of wildlife.    13. Tropical rain forests never have a dry season. Most of the trees have broad leaves that are never bare. Because little sunlight filters through the thick treetops, there is relatively little undergrowth on the rainforest floor.

Spatially warped cross-fading, popularly called \"morphing,\" is a computer-generated special effect that smoothly transforms one image into another. It was used to create stunning effects in films such as \"Terminator 2\" and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\" Now, morphing can be used in class on standard Macintosh computers. (A Windows version is expected in the summer.)   Morph 1.1 shows three windows on the screen. One is the original image -- a student's class photograph that has been digitized with a scanner, for example. Another is the target image, such as a second student's photograph. In the middle is the \"morph\" window. The user matches similar points on the two authentic images, nose and nose, right eye and right eye, and the software calculates the shape and color values in between. A sliding scale allows the user to slowly blend the first image into the second, third and beyond. The resulting \"morph\" images can be saved as a Quicktime movie.

Those who stayed on past the end of a recent episode may have noticed another unusual touch: that night's show was dedicated to someone named John (Yomi) Rothlisberger, who, the dedication said, had died this year.   The dedication followed a poignant final scene in which Mike Monroe, played by Anthony Edwards, bade goodbye to the citizens of Cicely, Alaska, and headed off on a quixotic environmental crusade above the Arctic Circle. Mike, who had suffered from a mysterious ailment that kept him housebound in a sealed dome, now believed he had recovered. But there were intimations of mortality in his parting words to the townspeople: \"So, my dear friends, fare thee well -- and if forever, still forever, fare thee well.\"   Mike had also been dating Maggie (Janine Turner), whose previous boyfriends had all been killed in various unfortunate accidents.    So who is Yomi Rothlisberger, and was the farewell scene written in tribute to him? To answer the last question first: No. \"The timing was kind of interesting, but it had nothing to do with it,\" said John Vreeke, the show's associate producer, speaking from Roslyn, Wash., where the show is filmed.    Mr. Vreeke explained that Mr. Rothlisberger was simply a \"little old farmer who lived in Roslyn\" and had been more or less adopted by the \"Northern Exposure\" cast, appearing on the series numerous times as an extra. Mr. Rothlisberger, 73, died after a bad fall, Mr. Vreeke said, and the producers wanted to do something to remember him.   A week after the March 15 show was broadcast, The New Yorker coincidentally published an article on relations between \"Northern Exposure\" and Roslyn, suggesting that residents were a bit put out by the onslaught of actors, producers and other television types crowding into their tiny mining town. But Mr. Vreeke insists that the meeting of Hollywood and Roslyn has been smooth and that people like Mr. Rothlisberger have helped make it so.   \"He didn't care about being in the TV show as much as he cared about being with us when were up here shooting,\" Mr. Vreeke said. \"He was kind and loving and generous.

I had a similar experience in August 1992.    The departure procedures from the gate were nonexistent. What went on was unbelievable and hazardous. Although there were numerous people seated and on line, no semblance of order was maintained once the only announcement of the evening was made, namely, that the flight was available for boarding. People began shoving and pushing and cutting into line. To prevent a personal injury, I stepped back and allowed the unruly crowd to surge forward. The behavior of this crowd was disgraceful and animalistic.

He also drew up the original plans for the University of Virginia. (\"Architecture is my delight and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements,\" he once said.)   Events starting this month through the fall include garden tours of Monticello and the University of Virginia and walking tours focusing on African-American life on the Monticello plantation. On April 12 William H. Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, will give a free lecture on Jefferson at the University of Virginia Law School. Events on April 13 include the unveiling of a Jefferson stamp at Monticello and the opening of a major exhibition of the house as it was during Jefferson's time. Birthday events at the University of Virginia include speeches by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the columnist George Will. Events on April 13 are free, except for the special exhibition at Monticello, where visitors must pay the regular admission fee of $8.

A sound not unlike that of a circus calliope rolling across the far horizon, the fresh morning sunlight warming its pipes. Or the sound, maybe, of the zephyr when it passes over empty glass bottles in the grass and suddenly makes them hum and whistle. Even when the group is articulating forceful sentiments -- and exhorting a black youth who is fleeing the South African police to \"hide by day, run at night, fight to live, live to fight\" -- it does so with sweet harmonies and gentle rhythms.   The performers, dressed in khaki, function as a kind of Greek chorus in \"The Song of Jacob Zulu,\" the drama by Tug Yourgrau at the Plymouth Theater about apartheid's terrible toll. As the story follows its fitful course, they offer words of prophecy and wisdom, expressions of sorrow and exultation, just as the citizens of Thebes do in \"Oedipus the King.\" But always in their distinctive musical style -- persistently beguiling, even incantatory at times. They are not simply the best part of \"The Song of Jacob Zulu.\" They    are    the song. The play itself is an unfortunate scramble of dramatic sharps and flats.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Nancy Freilicher and Karl Wunderlich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/style/weddings-nancy-freilicher-and-karl-wunderlich.html","abstract":"  Dr. Nancy Ann Freilicher, a daughter of Vivian and Ira Freilicher of East Hills, L.I., was married last evening to Karl Eric Wunderlich, a son of Dr. Charles Wunderlich of Kirkwood, Mo., and the late Lois Wunderlich.

All you need is Morse's grasp of poetry, ornithology, pornography, ballistics, human nature and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It also helps to adopt the work method of \"prayer and fasting\" that he recommends to his good Sergeant Lewis. Failing that, you can always surrender in admiration to Morse, the most prickly, conceited and genuinely brilliant detective since Hercule Poirot.   The irascible hero is on vacation in Lyme Regis, planning to reread Jane Austen and the \"Odyssey\" and to catch up on church architecture, natural history and his billiard skills, when he is distracted by a newspaper account of \"sinister verses\" that hold clues to the year-old disappearance of a Swedish student. Intrigued, he makes his own anagrammatic contribution to the lively, allusive dialogue in the letters to the editor column -- a cryptographer's delight of \"extraordinary if possibly unwarranted ingenuity\" -- which eventually leads to the reopening of the case.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"New & Noteworthy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/books/new-noteworthy.html","abstract":"  FIVE HUNDRED SCORPIONS, by Shelby Hearon. (Warner, $9.99.) In this novel, an estranged husband and wife undertake vastly different personal odysseys. Paul Sinclair, a lawyer, leaves Charlottesville, Va., to join an anthropological project in Mexico; his wife, Peggy, does some social experimenting of her own at home. In 1987 our reviewer, Lowry Pei, called the book \"witty\" and \"fast-paced,\" adding that \"the demonic and the domestic inhabit the novel together in a struggle that denies neither and intensifies both.\"     COMING INTO THE END ZONE: A Memoir, by Doris Grumbach. (Norton, $9.95.) The novelist Doris Grumbach began this journal the year she turned 70, expecting to chronicle unsentimentally her own decline. Instead the memoir celebrates her spiritual strength as she travels, buys a house in Maine and continues to record her own vibrant perceptions. \"The immortal and immune part of her has triumphed, and the result is a deeply satisfying book,\" Noel Perrin said here in 1991. Norton has also reissued Ms. Grumbach's 1981 novel, THE MISSING PERSON ($9.95), the story of a Marilyn Monroe-like actress who allows herself to be completely defined by others. Our reviewer, Herbert Gold, described the author as \"ironic and discreet,\" praising the novel's conclusion for \"its special distanced note of grieved attention.\" Also available in a new Norton edition is CHAMBER MUSIC ($9.95), in which Ms. Grumbach used the life of another historic figure, the American composer Edward MacDowell, as the inspiration for fiction. Written as the memoir of a woman whose husband was truly married only to his music, the book provides a \"look into the chamber of one unassuming heart,\" Gail Godwin said here in 1979.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Sanchez And Graf Gain Final","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/sports/tennis-sanchez-and-graf-gain-final.html","abstract":"  First, Gabriela Sabatini, with disbelief in her eyes, but sportsmanship in her manner, walked toward the net to shake the hand of Steffi Graf, the familiar nemesis who had just snubbed her, 6-0, 7-6 (7-3), in the semifinal of the Family Circle Magazine Cup.    Then she trudged to the baseline behind Graf and checked the mark of the barely errant service return that cost her a chance to fight to the finish in her bid to reach her fourth consecutive final here.

The hottest hand for New Jersey was Derrick Coleman, who took over in the third quarter and finished with a team-leading 30 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds and 2 blocked shots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Ellen Barkin: Is She Difficult Or Just Straight Outta Queens?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/movies/film-ellen-barkin-is-she-difficult-or-just-straight-outta-queens.html","abstract":"  Ellen Barkin bites into a strawberry and takes a sip of decaf.
