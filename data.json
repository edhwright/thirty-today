Many more would surely like to, and are surely destined to -- if the Administration and the states succeed in changing welfare by requiring recipients to commit themselves to education, training and jobs. Millions of American youngsters are spending, or will spend, several of their most formative years in the charge of strangers. They are going to be cheated -- because their country has yet to give day care the serious attention it deserves.   According to a recent study of hundreds of day care centers in California, Colorado, Connecticut and North Carolina, conducted by child psychologists and economists at four universities, the care provided by most is so poor it threatens the youngsters' emotional and intellectual development. As for the parents, 90 percent of whom rated the care as \"good,\" they were sadly misinformed, either because they did not recognize quality care or did not demand it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950213","headline":"Sports of The Times; Role Models Abound As Well as Rebound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/13/sports/sports-of-the-times-role-models-abound-as-well-as-rebound.html","abstract":"  Contrary to the prevailing notion that professional basketball has been taken hostage by marauders from Generation X, not one player refused to enter a game here this weekend, or walked into America West Arena with his sneakers unlaced.

The Khmer Rouge insurgents are the remnants of a movement that killed an estimated one million Cambodians when it held power during the 1970's.

The standards, according to conservative critics, compulsively spotlight what America has done wrong and celebrate little of what it has done right. Lynne Cheney, former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which helped finance development of the standards, points out that they mention McCarthyism 19 times and the Ku Klux Klan 17 times -- but never mention Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein.   The critics have a point. But a small, misleading point. Reading the standards and support materials is exhilarating.

The measure is deeply flawed. It is called the National Security Revitalization Act, but if adopted it would endanger national security.   We are committed to working with Congress in a bipartisan fashion. But if this measure is passed in its current form, we have told the President we will recommend that he veto it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950213","headline":"Runner, 18, Is Gaining Ground Despite the Losses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/13/sports/track-and-field-runner-18-is-gaining-ground-despite-the-losses.html","abstract":"  There were all kinds of winners yesterday at the 21st annual Colgate Women's Track and Field Games.

The dark land in question in this 1970 work was Vietnam, and the piece sets up opposition between hostile, shrieking dissonances and otherworldly consonances, between aggressive sounds of assault and haunting timbres redolent of Asian instruments. The Western string quartet is juxtaposed with sounds emerging from Chinese gongs, bowed water glasses and whispered overtones. This unambiguous set of oppositions inspired by the Vietnam War is accompanied by allusions to annihilation and redemption.   But on this program at the Majestic Theater, which was the first of four presented by the Kronos in its residency at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this season, the piece took on other resonances as well. Written at the height of the counterculture and invoking many of its themes, it seemed an ancestor to much of the post-modern repertory that has defined the Kronos Quartet and made it the most popular contemporary chamber ensemble.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950213","headline":"Both Sides Are Adamant in Fight Over Independent Police Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/13/nyregion/both-sides-are-adamant-in-fight-over-independent-police-review.html","abstract":"  Amid repeated allegations of police brutality, leaders of black and Hispanic groups here are pressing for an independent board to look into complaints against the police.

It is equally clear that his centerpiece accomplishment has been the 12.3 percent decline in crime in 1994. The city's streets look and feel safer. Citizens and visitors have responded to that change in mood.   But there is now a disturbing sense that all the Giuliani administration's accomplishments are balanced on a knife's edge.

The last time the multicultural issue was debated, as the city considered the so-called Rainbow Curriculum, it tore the board apart and led to the ouster of Joseph A. Fernandez as Schools Chancellor. This time, Mrs. Gresser is proposing a controversial revision to the board's multicultural-education policy that would narrow it to cover only the \"ethnic, racial and linguistic groups who live and work together in our city, our nation and the world around us.\" She proposes establishing a separate curriculum about discrimination that would cover \"race, religion, national origin, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, handicapping condition or age.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950214","headline":"Nation's Vital Documents Get Checkups","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/14/science/nation-s-vital-documents-get-checkups.html","abstract":"  GLANCING at the framed documents lying on the table, one can readily see that \"America\" has changed over the last two centuries.

We meet another man whose memory has stopped in the 1960's, imprisoning him in a time capsule defined by early rock-and-roll.

The composers were probably uninterested in polemics; they were doing what composers have always done, grafting new sounds and influences onto their own languages. Exoticism was one of two topics explored in the New York Festival of Song's program of French music on Saturday evening at the 92d Street Y. The other theme, amorous misadventure, was also a mainstay of French composers.    Michael Barrett and Steven Blier, the festival's directors, presented several solutions to the problem of combining East and West. Maurice Delage struck a tenuous but fascinating balance in his \"Poemes Hindous\" (1912). The accompaniments sometimes approximated the sounds of an Indian ensemble, with a cello mimicking the elastic pitches of a sitar and violins supplying a tamboura drone. But the vocal melodies were unmistakably Gallic.

That much was evident, in this case, in the heavy draperies, the gilded decorations, the weighty mirrors, the flickering gaslights and the velvet, burgundy costumes.
