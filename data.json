The move will come in President Clinton's detailed budget request, expected to be made public the week of April 4, said George Stephanopoulos, the chief White House spokesman. How Congress will respond and how hard Mr. Clinton will push the issue are still unclear, say lawmakers and legislative analysts on Capitol Hill. Abortion foes say they believe they have a good chance of blocking the President. Signal of Deep Change    For all the uncertainties, Mr. Clinton's decision to seek the repeal of the 16-year-old Federal prohibition, the Hyde Amendment, which applies to the Medicaid program for poor people, is a sign of the sea change in abortion politics. Both sides of the abortion issue predict that the next six months will test old positions, longstanding alliances and the power of the abortion-rights movement under a friendly Administration.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930330","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-90233664294.html","abstract":"Muslims in America Regarding the report \"U.S. Makes an Arrest in Tower Bombing\" (March 5):.

So clear is the trend that some biologists suggest that the evolutionary process is actually driving the increase in complexity, pushing the upper limit of life's intricacies ever higher.   But in two of the first studies to measure these trends, based on mammals' backbones and fossil shells, researchers say they have been unable to detect any overall evolutionary drive toward greater complexity, at least over periods of tens and even hundreds of millions of years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930330","headline":"Doctor Recounts Threats By Farrow Against Allen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/nyregion/doctor-recounts-threats-by-farrow-against-allen.html","abstract":"  A clinical psychologist testified yesterday that she warned Woody Allen that she feared for his safety because of threats made by Mia Farrow.

If I catch the squirrels that have taken over my bird-feeder and take them to the woods several miles away, will they make it back to my yard? In other words, do squirrels have a homing instinct?     A. \"They do have such an instinct,\" said John C. Muir, an urban geographer who is executive director of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment in Prospect Park. \"It is not well understood by science, but they will often return several miles.\"   As an example, he described an informal experiment at his own institution, which conducts extensive environmental education programs for school children and adults.   Some years ago, he said, a classroom in the park's Picnic House was invaded by squirrels that would distract the children. \"You have never lived until you have dealt with hundreds of fourth-graders, at the most inopportune time, aroused by cries of 'Rat! Rat!' \" he said.    So the center trapped the squirrels alive and transported them as far away as the Dyker Beach Golf Course near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is about seven miles away from Prospect Park, as the crow flies.   \"We got a chance to know these squirrels intimately,\" he said, \"and there is no doubt that the same ones were back in three to four days.\" They had somehow found their way for more than seven miles, through urban backyards and busy streets, to their preferred habitat. Water With Meals    Q.    My grandmother used to say you shouldn't drink water with your meals, only afterward. Is there any reason for this?     A \"Physiologically, it can't make any difference at all,\" said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairman of the department of nutrition, food and hotel managment at New York University.    The water is absorbed by the body, she said, just as the body absorbs the significant proportion of food itself that is water. The only real difference is that water takes up space in the digestive tract that could be occupied by food.    \"Many diet plans suggest drinking huge amounts of water with food,\" she said, to provide extra bulk and keep the person from eating to excess, but she said that most people's calorie-control mechanisms quickly compensated for such attempts to outsmart them.   \"It is funny how the advice has shifted,\" she said. \"People eat so much more now that I guess you can ascribe it to the shift from nutritional deprivation to nutritional excess.\"     Readers are invited to submit questions about science to Questions, Science Times, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

Second were Martin Scheinberg of Manhattan, Bill Eisenberg of Boca Raton, Fla., Benito Garozzo and Lea Dupont of Palm Beach, Fla.   The Women's Swiss Team title went to Karen McCallum, Kerri Shuman, both of Manhattan, Jill Meyers and Kay Schulle, both of Santa Monica, Calif. Second were Jean Anderson, Janet Daling, both of Seattle, Sharon Colson of Kirkland, Wash., and Broma Lou Reed of Boulder, Colo. A Take-Out Double    On the diagramed deal both West players opened two clubs, using a strong-club system. Both North players made a take-out double, and one South chose a penalty pass, collecting 300. When Shuman was South she jumped to three no-trump, as shown, and received the lead of the club king. She led a diamond to the queen and another to the king which held. A heart to the king was taken by the ace, and East led her remaining diamond to her partner's ace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930330","headline":"In Ukraine, Sigh of Relief Over Vote","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/world/in-ukraine-sigh-of-relief-over-vote.html","abstract":"  Ukraine uttered a not-so-quiet sigh of relief today after the Russian Congress of People's Deputies ended after failing to oust Boris N.

This work, a Circle Repertory Company production at the Brooks Atkinson Theater on Broadway, is set mostly among the towering redwoods in Northern California where untold thousands of Vietnam veterans have disappeared into a feral, ghostly existence, their only contact with civilization an occasional visit to town for an odd job or a meal scarfed from a garbage can.

The other is a Butoh dancer, Min Tanaka. He is seemingly clad in layers of clay, wearing a stiff earthen mask, miming the doomed ruler's every gesture or enacting his history in formalized gestures. He is a lifesize puppet, a mirror of Oedipus, the Theban king who is himself a sort of puppet, forced into a tragic snare set by the gods.    But as the horrifying truth of Oedipus's past comes to light, the clay shell around Mr. Tanaka is shed, leaving a vulnerable, nearly naked man: the only human figure free of elaborate costume and cosmetic trappings in the entire film. He who has been so blind to himself blinds himself. We see shredded strips of blood-red ribbon hanging on his face. Groping, with a blank stare, he stumbles under the scaffolding and ramps that compose the somber stage set, until he is walking knee-deep in a pool of dark water, surrounded by ghostly figures.

Miss Fleming achieved that in several of the songs she offered. In Brahms's \"Lerchengesang,\" her smooth, slightly dark, gracefully weighted tone was ideal for the mystical imagery of Carl Candidus's text, and there was artfulness and subtlety in the way she shaped the lines, particularly ascending figures that tapered to a sweetly produced pianissimo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930331","headline":"Jets Are in Quandary Over 2 Defensive Ends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/31/sports/football-jets-are-in-quandary-over-2-defensive-ends.html","abstract":"  It seems unlikely that Reggie White, the Eagles' defensive end and premier free agent, will make a decision before tomorrow on which team he wants to play for.
