On the contrary, the reason the phrase has faded is that so much of this style has been embraced by American cooks of all stripes. Wood grilling, minimal saucing, wholesome ingredients, a profusion of vegetables and greens: all of these are now found in American dining rooms from coast to coast.   Three years ago Michael McCarty, sort of a reverse Balboa, trekked East toting his flavored woods and baby lettuces and discovered an eager market for them. Mr. McCarty had earned a reputation in the nascent days of California cooking with his restaurant, Michael's, in Santa Monica. He still runs it today, splitting his time between New York and California.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Clinton Plans to Ask Congress to Approve Smaller, Cheaper Space Station","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/us/clinton-plans-to-ask-congress-to-approve-smaller-cheaper-space-station.html","abstract":"  Saying that in even tight budgetary times the nation \"cannot retreat from our obligations to invest in our future,\" President Clinton said today that he would ask Congress to support a smaller, less-expensive version of the space station.    Mr. Clinton said a space station was crucial to the country's long-term technical leadership and a focal point for international cooperation in the post-cold war era. \"At a time when our long-term economic strength depends on our technological leadership and our ability to reduce the deficit, we must invest in technology but invest wisely, making the best possible use of every dollar,\" he said.   Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore strongly supported the concept of a space station in last year's Presidential campaign. But that support was called into question last spring when the President, under pressure to reduce the Federal deficit and Government spending, ordered the space agency to redesign the orbiting laboratory to cut its costs significantly.    The Administration said it would propose spending $10.5 billion on the space station over the next five years, asking for $2.1 billion a year starting in the fiscal year 1994. In order to construct a permanently staffed orbital laboratory, spending could reach $16.5 billion by the year 2001, it said.   Compared with spending estimates for the original Space Station Freedom, which would have taken $14.4 billion in the next five years and $25.6 billion to complete, the new proposal could save up to $9 billion in construction costs and $18 billion in operating costs over the projected 10-year life of the station, the White House estimated.   Senior Administration officials said Mr. Clinton was pleased with the proposals for cutting costs, and would make the space station a \"high priority\" in future budgets. \"You can and should assume that the President will support this, and that he will get involved personally,\" said a White House official who spoke on condition that he not be identified.   In addition to redesigning the station and streamlining the program's management, Mr. Clinton called for reducing bureaucracy and personnel at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to improve efficiency.    Noting that Mr. Gore's National Performance Review team would work with the agency on proposed management changes, Mr. Clinton said, \"We are going to redesign NASA as we redesign the space station.\" Cutbacks in Personnel    NASA has spent almost $9 billion on the space station project over the last decade and continues to spend about $150 million a month on the program.  An independent panel that reviewed the latest NASA redesign effort said most of the savings of the new design would come from major changes in the management and organization of the project, including a 30 percent reduction in the 17,000 NASA and contractor personnel working on the program.   Mr. Clinton reviewed three options for a scaled-down station and chose a combination of the two that most resembled the existing design of the space station Freedom. That design calls for pressurized modules and solar power units attached to a girder-like truss or backbone. Mr. Clinton's plan incorporates most of the elements of what was called Option A, a simplified version of Freedom with scaled-down modules and less complex electrical and data systems, but includes elements of the more expensive Option B.   The President rejected the least expensive alternative, Option C, which called for orbiting the core of a station, a pressurized cylinder with solar panels attached, launched in a single space flight. Option C, criticized as less advanced technically than the other two, would not easily have accommodated modules being developed by international partners to the project.   The White House said the Administration would spend the next 90 days working with Congress, NASA and the project's international partners in Japan, Canada and Europe to work out the details of a new, simplified design of the station. A major goal of the effort, it said, would be to expand international participation in the project, which some observers took to mean a greater role for Russia.   \"I will also seek to enhance and expand the opportunities for international participation in the space station project so that the space station can serve as a model of nations coming together in peaceful cooperation,\" Mr. Clinton said.   Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington, said the President's action could make the station a truly international project. \"I read the President's statement as leaving the door wide open for enhanced Russian participation,\" he said.   Major supporters in Congress said the President's decision to stay with many aspects of the design now in development would help the project retain political support, particularly among Congress members with space station work in their districts. Clinton Backs Supercollider    On another technological matter, Mr. Clinton today reaffirmed his support for the Energy Department's Superconducting Supercollider in a letter to Congress, a week before the House is to debate how it would finance the project.   \"These are tough economic times, yet our Administration supports this project as part of its broad investment package in science and technology,\" he wrote in a letter to the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, William H. Natcher, Democrat of Kentucky.   Mr. Clinton sent the letter to Congress to counter speculation that the Administration planned to trim the $8.25 billion particle-accelerator project under construction in Texas, a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930618","headline":"CLINTON AND CONGRESS: Medicare; Cutting Health Dollars to Heal Deficit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/us/clinton-and-congress-medicare-cutting-health-dollars-to-heal-deficit.html","abstract":"  The two houses of Congress are preparing for a fight over how deeply to cut the growth of Medicare, a fight that has major implications for the nation's elderly, for doctors and hospitals, and for the success of President Clinton's plan to overhaul the nation's health-care system.

The Pattern and Decorative movement of the 1970's tried to effect a truce, but negotiations faltered in the 80's. A furniture-as-art vogue came and went overnight, and craft objects showed up in the work of consumerist artists like Jeff Koons and Haim Steinbach chiefly for their irony value. The present trend toward multiculturalism might reconcile the two categories, and exhibitions like \"Africa Explores\" at the Center (now Museum) for African Art a few years ago demonstrated how it could be done. But crossover figures in New York City galleries are still rare.   All of which gives \"Glass Installations,\" at the American Craft Museum, more than usual interest. The six participating artists have created large-scale, site-specific installations from glass, a medium long identified with discrete functional forms and highly specialized techniques. In doing so, they obscure -- with varying degrees of success -- the line between traditional craft and the kind of politically and psychologically motivated installation art popular today. While none of the work in the show is earthshakingly radical -- in fact, some of it feels vaguely familiar and expressively tepid -- it represents a step in an interesting direction, and a good one for the American Craft Museum to be taking at this time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Rhode Island Governor Settles Paternity Suit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/us/rhode-island-governor-settles-paternity-suit.html","abstract":"  Gov.

They simply occur in a series of episodes that inevitably remind one of the plotting of daytime soap operas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Corruption in Government-Bought Science Needed Exposure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/opinion/l-corruption-in-government-bought-science-needed-exposure-574093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Revenge on Two Whistle-Blowers\" (editorial, June 4) objects to the use by Walter Stewart, my fraud-busting colleague, of a hunger strike to protest muzzling by our employer, the National Institutes of Health. Without the hunger strike, would you have written an editorial?   Scientific fraud wastes money and leads to the punishing of whistle-blowers. More important, fraud and the way it is covered up are signs of bad ethics, which cost more in other ways. The problem is dirty politics, incubating in American science since World War II, when the Government started paying for most research.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Owners Approve Playoff Format","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/sports/baseball-owners-approve-playoff-format.html","abstract":"  Major league club owners yesterday endorsed an expanded playoff format for 1994, but in a rare development for them, they listened to the players union and omitted the details for the plan that doubles participation in post-season play.

People are foxes (who know many things) or hedgehogs (who know one big thing); Apollonians (advocates of order and classical discipline) or Dionysians (revelers in the romantic and the extreme). Writers are palefaces (genteel surveyors of sensibility, like Henry James) or redskins (raucous explorers of the outer limits, like Melville). One is \"in\" or \"out\"; in Nancy Mitford's words, \"U\" or \"Non-U.\" Or, as Ken Kesey once put it, you're either on the bus or off the bus.   Recently, however, such amusing distinctions have given way to more serious efforts to pigeonhole the world, efforts that underscore our tendency to see everything in terms of either-or, all-or-nothing, left-or-right. Teen-agers used to ask each other, \"Are you a fan of the Stones or the Beatles?\" John or Paul? Those innocuous questions, used to categorize one as a human being, have been replaced by similarly reductive -- but considerably more loaded -- litmus tests: Are you \"pro life\" or \"pro choice\"?

It would be stretching things to say that the medium is making a comeback, although it's about time: like the Democrats, painting has been out of office for so long that, in theory, it ought to be able to do some good. But it does seem that painting has a higher priority among young entry-level artists than it has had in recent seasons. With several galleries mounting painting shows concentrating on younger painters, re-election could be just around the corner.    Although these shows hardly represent the full range of painting being done at the moment, even by the younger generation, they do provide some interesting signals about the medium's direction. Cartoons, usually mixed with abstract elements, are especially hot, as are high-key fluorescent colors, which give some of these shows an undeniable visual bounce. Variations on the all-over composition, whose roots go back to Jackson Pollock's abstract drip paintings, continue to proliferate, often made of tiny semi-legible images.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"At Elizabeth High School; A 'Benevolent Despot' Still Speaks His Mind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/sports/at-elizabeth-high-school-a-benevolent-despot-still-speaks-his-mind.html","abstract":"  \"I was the black kid of my generation,\" said the man called Coach. \"Rahway was a Waspy place and I'm half Italian, half Albanian.

Sometimes the reef has been made of coral, other times junk. But it's always been a behemoth, bringing in tourists from all over the world. Though it has long lost the function of mirroring trends, it's still an immensely important event, partly because it stimulates other festivals. For the last five years, the Knitting Factory in the East Village has run its downtown version of the JVC Jazz Festival, called What Is Jazz?   This year's JVC Jazz Festival, as always, features some of the best improvisers in the jazz tradition, including Joe Henderson, Wynton Marsalis, Gerry Mulligan, Betty Carter, Elvin Jones, Freddie Hubbard, Benny Golson, Gary Bartz and many more. And it's heavy on singers, including Lena Horne, Cassandra Wilson, Anita O'Day, Ms. Carter and Mel Torme. But gone are the late-afternoon solo piano concerts, and to find any evidence of the jazz renaissance of the last decade, one has to search the fine print for sidemen and opening acts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"The Second City Is Getting Ready For a Third Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/sports/pro-basketball-the-second-city-is-getting-ready-for-a-third-title.html","abstract":"  Magic Johnson played cards with Michael Jordan on Tuesday.

That concern is being addressed here this week at the seventh Boston Early Music Festival and Exhibition, which assembles every two years. After exploring the late Classical era in recent years, the festival set aside the newfangled stuff and returned to the movement's roots. This year's program is devoted mainly to music of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when Renaissance styles gave way to Baroque innovations. Its modernist edge is a concert of Colonial and 19th-century American hymns and ballads to be given by the Boston Camerata on Saturday evening.

There was ferocious Republican opposition and stratospheric nervousness about campaign reform on both sides of the aisle.    Ignoring scandals and public disgust at corrupt and distracting campaign fund raising, Republicans have blocked meaningful change since 1974. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, deserves credit for breaking this gridlock with a difficult victory that keeps reform alive.

NEW YORK CITY MORE ANGLES IN CAMPAIGN  The race for New York City comptroller seemed simple two months ago. It was a two-way matchup between Alan G. Hevesi, a little-known Assemblyman from Queens who had some impressive endorsements, and Elizabeth Holtzman, the formidable and battle-scarred incumbent who had been struggling under the weight of a conflict-of-interest investigation. But the late entry of Herman Badillo has added a volatile element to the race. Page 25.

About 100 shots were fired by the fleeing suspects and the pursuing police over the 30 miles of the chase. The pursuit began at Pearl River High School about 9:15 A.M and ended about 11 A.M. with the capture of four suspects as they ran from a stolen getaway car into woods beside the Garden State Parkway in the Bergen County suburb of Washington Township, officials said.

How can sexual desire be a sin? Did not God instruct Adam and Eve to be fruitful and to multiply? Did He not say, having created woman from Adam's rib, that \"therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\"? The singleness of flesh is itself a vivid metaphor for copulation. The organic world is soaked in sex; Lucretius, in his epic \"On the Nature of Things,\" begins by saluting Venus: \"Yea, through seas and mountains and tearing rivers and the leafy haunts of birds and verdant plains thou dost strike fond love into the hearts of all, and makest them in hot desire to renew the stock of their races, each after his own kind.\"\n\nVenus alone, in the rousing translation by Cyril Bailey, is \"pilot to the nature of things\" -- without her aid nothing \"comes forth into the bright coasts of light, nor waxes glad nor lovely.\" Two millenniums after Lucretius and his fellow Latin celebrants of all-powerful love, Freud and his followers have reconfirmed the helplessly sexual nature of humankind and have announced the harmfulness, not to say the futility, of sexual repression. How strangely on modern ears falls the notion that lust -- sexual desire that wells up in us as involuntarily as saliva -- in itself is wicked! With what nervous hilarity did we greet Jimmy Carter's famous confession: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\" Mr. Carter was running for President at the time; his opponent, the incumbent Gerald Ford, was a more typical post-Freudian man. Asked how often he made love, he healthily responded, \"Every chance I get.\" Impotence, frigidity, unattractiveness -- these are the sins of which we are truly ashamed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"IN THE NATURAL STATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/nyregion/in-the-natural-state.html","abstract":"THE bird opened her eyes at the first touch of morning sun.

The sun was just setting as the carriage bearing the author-to-be of \"Barry Lyndon\" and \"Vanity Fair\" rounded Croagh Patrick and rumbled along the coast road on into Westport: \"The mountains were tumbled about in a thousand fantastic ways and . . . the bay . . . which sweeps down to the sea, and a hundred islands in it, were dressed up in gold, and purple, and crimson, with the whole cloudy west in a flame. Wonderful, wonderful!\"   In the 150 years since Thackeray -- who was usually more prone to satire than hyperbole -- published his sharply observant travel narrative \"The Irish Sketchbook,\" little has changed along the shores of Clew Bay. A paved road now winds among the villages and resorts along the north-facing coast, spilling out onto the pier at Roonagh Quay, meandering inland through the pub-lined main street of Louisburgh, and skirting the swatch of brilliant white sand against the bay's dark aqua at Old Head Beach.

Twenty children scrambled for their backpacks, grabbed a last-minute snack of green grapes and lined up at the door. But Ms. Miller's duties did not end when she walked her boisterous charges to the lobby. Fifteen minutes later, she had an appointment across the street for a parent-teacher conference at Ashley Harvey's house.\n\nThe girl's parents, Robert and Jo Harvey, ushered Ms. Miller into their living room, where Ashley settled into her mother's lap on the sofa. The adults discussed Ashley's anxiety about leaving her mother in the morning, her growing interest in spelling and her readiness for first grade. Before leaving, Ms. Miller read Ashley the story \"City Mouse, Country Mouse.\" Such visits are not unusual for Ms. Miller and two other kindergarten teachers at Morris Street. They are participating in an innovative program in the Danbury schools that aims to increase parental involvement, as well as providing more full-day kindergartens and preventing older students from dropping out. Over the last nine months, Ms. Miller has visited all her students' homes at least once. Sometimes she brings an interpreter; many parents are immigrants from the Dominican Republic, South America and Asia. Although most students walk to the neighborhood school, parents seem happier to meet the teacher on their own turf. \"School doesn't seem to have happy memories for them,\" Ms. Miller said.\n\n Last year, after being designated by the General Assembly as one of 12 urban priority districts, Danbury received $1 million from the state for the current school year, to try to reduce the number of students who drop out. The other priority districts are Bridgeport, Hartford, Meriden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, Norwalk, Norwich, Stamford, Waterbury and Windham. The state program manager, Carol Chapin, said that the districts were given a total of $10 million for 1992-93, and that legislators budgeted $11 million for 1993-94. District officials were required to develop three-year programs, with grants to be determined annually. \n\nPreviously, the choice of priority districts was based on test scores and the number of children from families on welfare. In Danbury, only one child in nine comes from a welfare home. But the new rules automatically included the state's eight largest cities, based on the 1990 census. Smaller districts are eligible for aid if they have large numbers of children from families on welfare.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Human Greed Holds the Reins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/sports/l-human-greed-holds-the-reins-566093.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   It took me years to recover from the tragedy of the Ruffian-Foolish Pleasure race, but with the Belmont, I have watched my last race.

The main gallery at MacCulloch Hall has been born again -- with walls painted a color that lies somewhere between lime and apple green. Even so, the display of woodcuts by Arthur Wesley Dow (1857-1922) more than holds its own -- as well it might, for Dow was a man intoxicated by color and well before the advent of Orphism and its American counterpart, Synchromism.   One reason the artist's work has not attracted comparable attention from historians may be that, drawing inspiration from Japanese prints, he expressed his chromatic ideas in landscape, rather than in abstractions. And though he took a \"holistic\" view that encompassed the decorative arts, he was primarily a printmaker. Yet as a teacher and writer he exerted considerable influence -- Georgia O'Keeffe, Max Weber and Alvin Langdon Coburn were among his students -- and did much to further the American branch of the Arts and Crafts Movement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Woman in the News; Immigration Expert Who Takes Broad Approach -- Doris Marie Meissner","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/woman-immigration-expert-who-takes-broad-approach-doris-marie-meissner.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON, June 19 A child of immigrants, Doris M.

Sit through a course on the Renaissance and chances are his name will not be mentioned: he was a nova in that constellation of Italian artists that held all Europe in thrall. The problem is that he was born a Sienese, and as all visitors to that Tuscan city know, Siena and its artists are synonymous with the Middle Ages. Writing on the occasion of a visit in 1873, Henry James remarked that \"other places perhaps may treat you to as drowsy an odor of antiquity, but few exhale it from so large an area.\"   The means of rectifying this neglect has been provided in the form of a lucidly conceived exhibition, \"Francesco di Giorgio and the Sienese Renaissance: 1450-1500,\" on view here through July 31 in the church of Sant' Agostino. The exhibition, which includes 120 paintings, sculpture, drawings and manuscript illuminations, is as rich and multifaceted as the personalities it features. Foremost among these is the great Florentine sculptor Donatello, who spent the years 1457 to '59 in Siena; Francesco's mentor, the sculptor-painter Vecchietta; his associate Nerroccio de' Landi; and the North Italian miniaturists Girolamo da Cremona and Liberale da Verona, who were called upon to illuminate the choirbooks of the cathedral.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"The Perps Are Almost Always Male","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/books/the-perps-are-almost-always-male.html","abstract":"MEN, WOMEN, AND AGGRESSION\nBy Anne Campbell.\n196 pp. New York: \nBasic Books. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Murder Trial in Beating by Detroit Officers Begins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/murder-trial-in-beating-by-detroit-officers-begins.html","abstract":"  A jury that took two painstaking weeks to assemble will have to decide whether the fatal beating of a black motorist was a wild exercise of raw power by the police or the action of committed officers confronted by a struggling man in a high-crime area.

But this year, even before the grass can turn traitor or the moody weather can wreak havoc , several Wimbledon contestants have already been set dangerously adrift by a particularly unforgiving draw.   The trouble starts right with the defending men's champion, Andre Agassi, whose No. 8 seeding not only happens to be the lowest ever awarded a holder of the title, but is also something of a gift considering his actual computer ranking of, ominously enough, 13th in the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Shuttle Is Readied to Retrieve European Satellite","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/us/shuttle-is-readied-to-retrieve-european-satellite.html","abstract":"  The space shuttle Endeavour and its crew of six were completing preparations today for a mission to track, catch and retrieve a European research satellite.

But measures that would speed the eviction process, and let towns require rent to be paid into the local housing court until the landlord gets a certificate of occupancy, did not reach the floor.

SUMMER'S STORY (Knopf, $17), a seemingly sprightly fable of childhood adventure and discovery by the German novelist Patrick Suskind, whose malevolent first novel, \"Perfume,\" was an international best seller. Unlike most coming-of-age stories, this one explores not only the mysteries of duty and desire, injustice, aging and death -- but also Galileo's laws of falling bodies. Set in a pleasant lakeside village \"shortly after the war,\" the tale is narrated by a nameless boy who loves his typically incomprehensible parents, dotes on his elusive sweetheart and despises his hilariously cranky piano teacher. Gravity (and perhaps gravitas) enters the life of this child \"so light I could fly\" in the form of the mysterious Mr. Summer, an eccentric recluse who spends all his time ferociously striding about the countryside, and whose single utterance is an angry \"Why can't you just leave me in peace!\" Like a force of nature, Mr. Summer pulls the airy narrator down to earth, providing sobering lessons about childhood foibles and grown-up fears. And if the translation by John E. Woods occasionally provides a few thuds of its own (\"They were only dreams, and like all dreams not really emotionally satisfying\"), the accompanying drawings by Jean-Jacques Sempe have the ethereal quality of innocence just on the brink of being lost.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"A Wrong Message For Young People?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/style/l-a-wrong-message-for-young-people-582293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Are you encouraging your readers to get stoned?

Rather than rich rolling hills, it has a gray, timeless austerity.   This stark landscape of megalithic tombs, caverns and castles, craggy lunarlike rocks and the most unusual flora in the country takes its name from the Gaelic boirinn, meaning stony area. Unlike the topography of the rest of Ireland, there are no bogs and few pastures. The limestone is deeply fissured, and most streams and rivers have gone underground. The only lakes are known as turloughs, hollows that fill up after a heavy rainfall saturates the underground systems and then evaporate after a few dry days. With few prominent landmarks, the Burren's landscape appears to stretch in an endless series of bare, irregularly shaped stones, dry and treeless.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"SURFACING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/style/surfacing.html","abstract":"  HUMILIATION -- Kill-all-the-lawyers redux: Echoes of Shakespeare's maxim are found in \"Jurassic Park\" (T. rex's first victim is a money-grubbing coward-at-law) and in a Miller Lite commercial in which several briefcase-toting lawyers are chased and roped in a rodeo.

The State Urban Development Corporation, after repeated requests under the Freedom of Information Act and a court order, which is being appealed, still won't reveal the content of the property leases involved, thereby making it impossible for homeowners to know what taxes or other payments would actually be required by law.

Potential Welsh learners should know that substantial rewards accrue long before attainment of conversational fluency. Welsh is so unpredictable that anyone who enjoys languages will become addicted from the first lesson. As reading facility develops, the learner will enjoy one of Europe's great literatures. Most poetry is difficult but the sagas are simple, direct, concise and powerful narrative. \"Branwen Ferch Lyr\" is a Greek tragedy in prose, 18 pages of elegantly parsimonious narrative (but material for a thousand-page novel) which begin with a pageant of majestic international harmony but soon explode in sadistically murderous violence that pits family against family, stirs up genocidal paranoia, and leaves Branwen to die of grief because \"two such marvelous islands\" (as Britain and Ireland) have been despoiled on her account.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Hot Hotels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/style/hot-hotels.html","abstract":"  WHAT puts the hot in a hot hotel?

Thurow (Op-Ed, June 8) is an example of how one might travel from New York to New Jersey by way of California. To begin with, value-added taxes are added incrementally at each stage of production, and they are not, as the author suggests, the difference between component cost and sales price.    However, no matter how the tax is calculated, it would increase the cost of every manufactured item without exception and raise the cost of living substantially. The author, recognizing this, suggests $4,000 exemptions for each individual, rebates for exports and charges for imports. More drawbacks and exemptions would undoubtedly be added case by case as need arises. The struggle for a good fit would never end.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"SUNY Chief Retires Proudly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/nyregion/suny-chief-retires-proudly.html","abstract":"  A PINK ballet slipper sits on a bookshelf in Dr. Sheldon N.

He leaves, he said, regretting that he could not create the \"marvelous synergy\" he envisioned between the School for the Arts and the College of Letters and Science, two of the campus's main divisions.

Depicted in architect's renderings with sunlight streaming through its sparkling glass skin, the arch brings out the primal emotions aroused by the sight of a rainbow after a storm. It may be years before this vision materializes. The $315 million needed to build it is not yet in hand. But Amtrak's proposal to resurrect Pennsylvania Station from a pit beneath Madison Square Garden and enshrine it within the landmark general post office building across the street has aroused more anticipation than any civic project in years.   No wonder, for this project pushes some of the hottest buttons in architecture and urbanism today. Public space. Infrastructure. Mass transit. Regional planning. But the hottest button of all is one that touches off a painful memory: the destruction of the original Pennsylvania Station station 30 years ago. The razing of this station, McKim, Mead & White's 1910 masterpiece of Beaux-Arts design, was one of the greatest traumas New York City ever suffered. Public reaction was profound, and in some ways beneficial. Historical preservation was transformed from a genteel pastime to a nationwide movement with political clout. Architects began to admit that the Modern movement was turning out to be less than a boon for cities. Above all, New Yorkers began to assert a proprietary interest in the city as their collective cultural heritage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"From Bosnian Crisis To All-Out War","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/opinion/from-bosnian-crisis-to-all-out-war.html","abstract":"  The horror in Bosnia will not reach a natural equilibrium at which the fighting will stop.

At each stop I pretended to be engrossed in my reading, hoping that my intense concentration would discourage even the bravest of commuters from interrupting me and asking that I remove 10 pounds of lawbooks from the seat. Yes, I was selfish. But we're talking law school here. Survival of the fittest.   After graduation from law school, I commuted all summer to a bar exam review course in Manhattan -- again, in my windowless corner seat. I was able to get two of the seven hours of daily studying done before I even got home.   After passing the bar exam, my commuting days ended.

Nearby, Sheldon Harnick was beaming at his wife's 16 watercolors now hanging in the C.F.M. Gallery on Greene Street in SoHo, her first extensive collection to be seen in New York City. Two Long Island exhibitions -- \"more abstract and adventurous,\" Mrs. Harnick said -- are to open, one on Aug. 7 at the Benton Gallery in Southampton and the other on Aug. 21 at the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton.   On a Wednesday afternoon two weeks ago Mr. Harnick was also edgy. The next night, \"She Loves Me,\" the 1963 musical, was to open in a new production on Broadway. Two days later he felt bolstered by the sterling reviews that just might transform from cult to hit status a romantic musical set in a Budapest parfumerie in 1934.    Not that the lyricist of \"Fiorello,\" which had opened four years earlier, and \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" one year later, needs bolstering, but after 30 years it is nice to know that a favorite show's time has come.  Benefit Performance Saturday    Mrs. Harnick, an artist in ascent, and Mr. Harnick, who divide their time between an apartment on Central Park West and a house in East Hampton, will appear in \"A Broadway Medley -- Hampton Style,\" one of 16 events next weekend on the South Fork to benefit Guild Hall in East Hampton.    In their hourlong performance at the house of Lillian Braude in East Hampton, the couple will include two selections from \"She Loves Me\" and two outtakes from \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" \"Dear Sweet Sewing Machine\" and \"The Butcher's Song.\" Their act is an outgrowth of a joint appearance at Rainbow and Stars in Manhattan several years ago.   \"That was a nice detour,\" Mr. Harnick recalled. \"But Margery needed to get back to art, and I wanted to go on writing.\"    Mr. Harnick's numerous works in progress include a 45-minute cantata, a full-scale version of \"Cyrano\" and a musical fantasy adapted from a Russian play.    \"Sheldon's a good director,\" Mrs. Harnick said. \"He knows the essentials he wants from the act.\"  Former Broadway Performer    Once a Broadway performer under the name of Margery Gray, she worked in two of Mr. Harnick's shows with scores by Jerry Bock, \"Tenderloin\" and \"Fiorello.\" \"But we weren't going out together then,\" she said. \"We were married after 'Fiddler.' \"   And then Ms. Gray appeared in, among others, \"Tovarich,\" as the ingenue in the musical starring Vivien Leigh; \"Drat, the Cat,\" as standby for Leslie Ann Warren, and opposite Hal Linden in a revival of \"Anything Goes,\" but no longer in Mr. Harnick's shows. \"Casts can be sensitive,\" she said, \"and we didn't want it to seem like nepotism. So we kept our work apart.\"    After their marriage -- her second and his third -- Mr. Harnick said: \"I respected Margery too much to say, 'I hope you give this up.' But I was delighted when she decided she wanted to be home, not rehearsing, or on the road.\"    They have a son, Matthew, a marine biologist in his 20's who lives in the Hamptons, and a daughter, Beth, from Mrs. Harnick's previous marriage. She is a songwriter in her 30's and lives in Los Angeles.   As a wife and mother who sometimes performed on commercials and voice-overs, Mrs. Harnick tried photography. Mary Rodgers and Tom Paxton, two neighbors in the Hamptons, bought her work, \"but that wasn't hands-on enough,\" she said. Awaiting the \"You're On\" Call    \"I grew up with a respect for art, and it was something to do in the dressing room while I was waiting to go on stage,\" Mrs. Harnick recalled. \"My mother, Mildred Gray, was a fashion designer. She painted, and she's still at it at 88. While other kids had coloring books, she gave us drawing pads and unchewed pencils.\"    Musing on her creative beginnings, Mrs. Harnick said:   \"All those years dancing in front of multimirrors in a rehearsal hall I was fascinated with the reflections' going out into space, the color play between light and people. I didn't realize that would grow into an obsession, and after I had done a piece of art, what an incredible revelation that I composed it, I lit it, I choreographed it. I did it all myself.   \"My work is about nature -- wind, sunsets, things floating in water. People see different things in them, whatever they want it to be, but I know where I'm going before I put it together. It's as if the paper, paper so thin it's translucent when the light comes in, were the paint.\"    Mrs. Harnick uses paper made of papyrus, carrots, Japanese rice, eggplant from South America and bark from trees in California. \"Beth sends those,\" she said.    On the harmony between greasepaint and watercolors in their lives, Mrs. Harnick said:   \"We have a station wagon to constantly schlep canvases from New York to East Hampton. I have my own identity, and we do a lot of benefits. We get to rehearse together and laugh. It's the best of both worlds.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"A Village in the Palm of One's Hand","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/books/a-village-in-the-palm-of-ones-hand.html","abstract":"OBABAKOAK\nBy Bernardo Atxaga.\nTranslated by Margaret Jull Costa.\n326 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living in: Morningside Heights","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/realestate/if-youre-thinking-of-living-in-morningside-heights.html","abstract":"IN a public relations move at the turn of the century, Morningside Heights was named \"The Acropolis on the Hill.\" The name has stuck, at least among guidebook writers and the neighborhood's present enthusiasts.\n\n Then, as now, educational, spiritual and medical institutions dominated the neighborhood, occupying about half the land; one institution -- Columbia University -- owns another quarter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930620","headline":"Chekhov in a Lifelike Setting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/20/nyregion/theater-chekhov-in-a-lifelike-setting.html","abstract":"  BEHOLD an esthetically correct \"Cherry Orchard.\" In the Rushmore mansion at Woodbury in Orange County the audience regards Chekhov's powerless elite through an arched doorway, on a sprawling lawn and in a grand ballroom.
