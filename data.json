Although the milieu invoked in this exhibition has evolved since Wharton's day, the struggle laid out in these rooms remains vivid and compelling in the way that the story of rebellion often does. It was once said of Edith Wharton and her friend Theodore Roosevelt that that they were both self-made. This is the true subject at the National Academy: how Edith Wharton, born into Old New York of the 1860's and raised in it during the 1870's and 1880's, found her way out of it -- and fully into her own life -- by the first decade of this century.\n\nTo the argument that the Wharton career has been too ubiquitous of late (\"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Ethan Frome\" filmed; her last unfinished novel, \"The Buccaneers,\" completed and published; the woman herself impersonated onstage by Irene Worth), the answer is that here, refreshingly, is a collection of iconography contemporary to Wharton's actual New York. Without the intervention of director, actor or footstep-following writer, it conjures a visual field in which to set Wharton, one that would have been instantly familiar to the woman herself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940603","headline":"9 Florida Hotels Blacking Out A TV Station's Crime Reports","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/us/9-florida-hotels-blacking-out-a-tv-station-s-crime-reports.html","abstract":"  Some of South Florida's larger hotels have decided to screen out the newscasts of a local television station because of its zealous coverage of crime news.

That sudden five-foot drop in the middle of the lawn of this Sussex country estate was designed to keep sheep from grazing up to the manor house.

No one tripped on Wednesday night, when the festival opened with a production of Mozart's \"Nozze di Figaro,\" but the ha-ha seems to have reproduced. After 60 years of presenting renowned opera performances in a quaint room originally built to hold only 300 people, Glyndebourne has an imposing new theater that seats 1,200 and cost $49.5 million.

Open a door in the organ room that used to lead to the old theater and you are faced with a cinderblock wall.

The saxophonist Illinois Jacquet first became a jazz headliner when he was a sideman in big bands like Cab Calloway's, Lionel Hampton's and, in the 1940's, Count Basie's last band. When he turned to leading his own group, he used a small combo, a format that lasted more than 30 years. But in the 1980's he became the last of the Swing Era stars to form his own big band. Lacking the locations that existed in the big bands' heyday, even such great survivors as the Duke Ellington and Count Basie Bands had been reduced by then to playing one-night stands. But the Jacquet band has now embarked on an unusual engagement: a five-week run at Tavern on the Green. The band plays tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11 P.M. and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. It will continue at the Tavern through July 3. The music charge is $23.50 on Fridays and Saturdays, or $17.50 on Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. JOHN S.

Atlantic Monthly Press. $21.     The British writer Will Self has a liking for decidedly unorthodox heroes: his last book, \"Cock & Bull\" (1993), featured a woman who sprouts a penis and a man who grows a vagina, and his new novel, \"My Idea of Fun,\" stars a boy who apprentices himself to the Devil and learns (or says he learns) how to commit coldblooded murder.   The difference between these books is huge. Whereas \"Cock & Bull\" squandered Mr. Self's evident gifts in sophomoric (and often highly sexist) jokes and high jinks, \"My Idea of Fun\" is a genuinely ambitious and accomplished novel, a novel that reads like an original and often willfully perverse Cuisinart mix of William Burroughs, William Gaddis, Thomas Pynchon and Lewis Carroll. One reads the book with a combination of fascination and nausea, intellectual curiosity and emotional horror, impressed by Mr. Self's virtuosic skills with language and satire even while being repelled by his images of necrophilia, mutilation and torture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940603","headline":"Canucks Head for Drawing Board","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/sports/stanley-cup-finals-canucks-head-for-drawing-board.html","abstract":"  Trevor Linden talked about the process.

On the closing day of the State Democratic Convention, Mr. Cuomo and his running mate, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, left the direct assaults on their probable Republican opponents, State Senator George E. Pataki and Elizabeth P. McCaughey, to a parade of surrogates. When it was Mr. Cuomo's turn, he used his meandering 50-minute acceptance speech to draw numerous substantive and political distinctions between the Democratic and Republican tickets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940603","headline":"School Chiefs Say Teachers Face Layoffs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/nyregion/school-chiefs-say-teachers-face-layoffs.html","abstract":"  Superintendents in New York City's 32 school districts say they will be forced to lay off hundreds of teachers under the Giuliani administration's proposed city budget.

Now the Giuliani administration, like the Dinkins administration before it, is considering revising the zoning rules. That would be a sound move if city officials take pains to protect small neighborhood stores that contribute to the vitality of life throughout the five boroughs.   There is ample evidence that the absence of superstores hurts the tax base and creates a drain on the general economy. Many shoppers in search of bargains go to Nassau, New Jersey and Westchester.

This was bracing compensation for the middling performance of Mozart's \"Nozze di Figaro\" that opened the hallon Wednesday evening.   In fact, \"Onegin\" received precisely the kind of staging and performance that made Glyndebourne's worldwide reputation. Graham Vick, the festival's director of productions, revealed an almost Classical refinement under the surface of this Romantic opera. Its tale of thwarted love unfolded through a series of spare, eloquently sung scenes. Onegin's first-act rejection of Tatyana, for example, was mirrored by Tatyana's third-act rejection of Onegin: in each scene, both characters sat in chairs on opposite corners of a nearly bare stage. Also, each act was clearly divided into a public scene of festive celebration and a private scene of confrontation and confession.

Done in 1893, Munch's image of an almost fetuslike figure, its head clasped in its hands and its mouth open in a cry of horror, has become increasingly familiar in popular culture around the world, a symbol of the overwhelming pressures of modern life.

Go for Gin, winner of the Kentucky Derby, shot six furlongs in 1:104/5 , which was even faster than scheduled by his trainer, Nick Zito. Brocco, winner of the Santa Anita Derby and fourth in the Kentucky Derby, worked one mile in 1:402/5 to the delight of his trainer, Randy Winick. Apelia Wins the Genuine Risk: The Genuine Risk, a six-furlong sprint named for the champion filly who won the Kentucky Derby in 1980, was won for the second year in a row by Apelia, who is owned by Steven Stavro, the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. The 5-year-old mare set speedy fractions as she outran Spinning Round, who is owned by George Steinbrenner, the managing partner of the Yankees. The winner covered the distance in 1:09, paid $5.60 for $2 to win and brought home the first prize of $60,000. She led almost all the way, and had three lengths on Spinning Round, who in turn had two lengths on Ann Dear.

(AP) TRACK AND FIELD  An Arkansas Miler Wins Again  If it isn't one Arkansas miler, it's another. In February and March, it was Niall Bruton, winning the Wanamaker Mile and the N.C.A.A. indoor mile. Yesterday, it was Graham Hood at the National Collegiate Athletic Association outdoor championships at Boise State University in Moscow, Idaho. Taking the lead from Andy Keith of Providence with half a lap to go, Hood held off Erik Nedeau of Northeastern to win the 1,500 meters in 3 minutes 42.10 seconds, and Keith, second to Bruton indoors, faded to last. Off a slow pace (2:06 at 800 meters) Hood closed with a sizzling 54.4 final 400. Bruton's fifth place gave the Razorbacks 14 points in their quest for their third straight men's team title.    Flirtisha Harris of Seton Hall, who doesn't like to run the 400 meters, added the N.C.A.A. outdoor 400 title to the indoor title she won in March. Running a perfectly judged race, she passed Janeen Jones in the final 30 meters and pulled away to win by 4 meters in 51.66 seconds, a personal best by nearly a second.   Arkansas won its third consecutive men's team title, and Louisiana State won its eighth consecutive women's team title.   Record Set in 5,000-Meter Race: Haile Gebreselasie of Ethiopia broke the world record in the men's 5,000 meters yesterday at the Adriaan Paulen Memorial meet in Hengelo, the Netherlands. Gebreselasie's time of 12 minutes 56.96 seconds was 1.45 seconds better than the previous mark by Said Aouita of Morocco. Allen Johnson led an American sweep in the 110-meter hurdles with a stadium record of 13.50. The world record-holder, Mike Powell, won the long jump with a leap of 25 feet 11 inches. (AP) Williams Paces Runners at M.A.C.: Louann Williams, running for the Caribbean Connection Track Club, successfully defended her sprint titles yesterday in the Coors/Metropolitan Athletics Congress outdoor men's and women's track and field championships at St. John's University. Williams, who has completed two years of junior college, won the 100 meters in 12.22 seconds and the 200 in 24.08 seconds. Both times were well off the Brooklyn resident's national junior records of 11.22 seconds and 22.70 seconds, respectively. Jawanna McMullen, the Christ the King High School standout sophomore, finished fourth (55.20 seconds) in the 400 meters won by Jessica Hudson in 54.40 seconds. In men's events, Andrew Bloom took the shot-put at 60 feet 1 inch and the discus at 184-3; Robert Ayres of Seton Hall was first in the 800 meters in 1 minute 50.82 seconds and Troy McIntosh of Morgan State was the 400-meter winner in 47.46 seconds.

The incident was just one sign of how the debate over Dr. Davis's leadership has become bitter and personal and public, to a point rarely seen on a college campus. It has raised issues of race and sex, spilled into the surrounding community of Jamaica, Queens, and pitted some local black leaders against the largely white faculty. So heightened have tensions become that the office of W. Ann Reynolds, Chancellor of the City University of New York, is trying to bring the two sides together, at the request of the faculty and staff. A School's Stability    In recent months, faculty and staff members have complained that many senior staff members have quit, raising concern about the institution's stability, and that Dr. Davis has made personnel decisions without the usual consultation with department faculty members. The faculty caucus had considered a vote of censure against her after three years of escalating tension. Instead, it decided to conduct an evaluation, a lesser step, but postponed it when the caucus president, Dr. James Donald Wynne, was killed by a car on May 17.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"A Wizard Shows Some (But Not All) Of His Secrets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/arts/classical-music-a-wizard-shows-some-but-not-all-of-his-secrets.html","abstract":"  HMM.

Both were characters in stunning productions of French Baroque opera directed by Jean-Marie Villegier and conducted by William Christie. And both, for all their differences, wore costumes and wigs of 17th-century French nobility, and looked as if they had stepped out of the court of Louis XIV.   This plumage was not precisely what the composers, Jean-Baptiste Lully (in \"Atys\") and Marc-Antoine Charpentier (in \"Medee\"), had in mind. Nor did Mr. Villegier heed the librettists' calls for scenic mountains, waterfalls and gardens. \"Atys\" took place in a windowless marble-paneled room at Versailles; \"Medee,\" in a brick church on a French nobleman's estate. But these radical restagings were not typical examples of directorial creativity. They created brilliant counterpoint to the supple performances, perhaps permanently changing the way these operas are thought about by those lucky enough to have been present. The genius lay in recognizing that both works are inseparable from the court of the Sun King, where they had their origins. \"Atys\" was first performed in 1676, \"Medee\" in 1693.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"Sylvia Hargrave And David Kelly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/style/weddings-sylvia-hargrave-and-david-kelly.html","abstract":"  Dr. Sylvia Lynn Hargrave, the daughter of Clara J.

Are audio books another stop along the way to illiteracy, or are they paradise enough for readers who just want something fun to do while driving to the beach or walking the dog? Millions are listening to books on cassettes these days, whether they buy them in bookstores, rent them or borrow them from public libraries. But what to buy or borrow? Most spoken-word material is pretty much junk food for the ear. Go to a big chain bookstore and you'll find generous supplies of Danielle Steel, badly abridged classics, autobiographies of movie stars, advice on how to enhance your wealth or reduce your weight -- all the same stuff, in fact, that keeps book publishers going. For the wretched excess of the season, there's even a newly released tape featuring graphic descriptions of the art of serial killing -- in the killer's own words! \n\nBut dreary as some of this sleaze is, there are bright spots -- honest entertainment on audio and even some series that are attempting to introduce new writers to new audiences. Only the worst sort of snob would sniff at abridging books that were never great literature in the first place. Listen, for example, to Peter Mayle reading his three-hour shortened version of \"A Year in Provence\" and \"Toujours Provence\" (Audio Renaissance, $29.95), with Patrick Macnee providing transitions between the amusing tales about an English couple adjusting to life in the French Midi, and it turns out you haven't missed much. And even some sprawling classics are an endurance test to listen to. They were written for the eye, after all, and work better trimmed down for the ear. One of the big sellers now, probably thanks to the recent television series, is a six-hour abridgment of George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" (Penguin-Highbridge Audio, $24).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"The Jefferson Market Courthouse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/realestate/l-the-jefferson-market-courthouse-278475.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your splendid article about the old Jefferson Market Courthouse  [ \"A Stopped Clock Sired the Preservation Movement,\" April 3 ] , in which is now housed the Greenwich Village public library, brought back a flood of memories.

Those two letters had virtually disappeared from the dazzling but misleading transcripts that a generation of students at Stanford (and plenty of other places) had used to impress parents, employers and graduate school deans.    The hope is that Stanford's decision to jettison a system that failed equally to reward excellence and punish indifference will be emulated throughout the educational system -- not only in elite colleges where rampant grade inflation has destroyed the idea of merit but also in secondary and elementary schools. The sad truth is that Stanford's permissive practices were merely the final expression of a sensibility that seeks foremost to eliminate the fear of failure, holds that feeling good is more important than doing well and assumes that somehow students can be injected with self-esteem rather than earning it by honest toil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"Turn On, Tune In, Interface","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/books/turn-on-tune-in-interface.html","abstract":"  THE INTERNET COMPLETE REFERENCE By Harley Hahn and Rick Stout. 817 pp. Berkeley, Calif.: Osborne McGraw-Hill.

Explorer, anthropologist, geography teacher and raconteur all in one, the travel writer was a paid importer of experience who delivered the exotic right to the home table, like so much tropical fruit in winter.   Norman Lewis's new book, AN EMPIRE OF THE EAST: Travels in Indonesia (John Macrae/Holt, $25), sets itself squarely in this generalist tradition. Mr. Lewis, an Englishman and seasoned travel writer, provides a classic narrative of manners, history and scenery from the land of more than 13,000 islands. Here are \"splendid\" views of palm-fringed lagoons; of Sumatran rice paddies where storks and egrets delicately step; of sinister mangrove swamps and a mosque abandoned to the jungle. Fruit bats, wings tied with twine, hang from roadside trees, sold to make a stew used as a cure for asthma. (Mr. Lewis gives this a miss, but makes up for it by breakfasting on chopped octopus and strawberries.) Of Indonesians, we learn that they will twist themselves into knots to avoid being the bearers of bad news; that their sense of humor tends to the slapstick; that traditional hunting rituals feature a shaman conjuring up the spirit of a monkey and apologizing for its imminent death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"On West 57th, a Confederacy of Kitsch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-critic-s-notebook-on-west-57th-a-confederacy-of-kitsch.html","abstract":"  NEW YORK CITY thrives on change, but sometimes the changes are hard to swallow.

The city now uses nine armories to house 1,298 homeless men and women in Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"My Dog's Smarter Than Your Dog","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/books/my-dog-s-smarter-than-your-dog.html","abstract":"  THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS Canine Consciousness and Capabilities.

Most settle for mere table scraps and produce a dog's breakfast of well-chewed erudition and insight. Others persist, terrierlike, until a prize like Bowser's \"Man Writes Dog\" (Westminster Press) is carried in one day and dropped beside one's Morris chair. You are invited to devour the leftovers here presented. Perhaps they do reek a bit of age. Perhaps home videos like \"Rex Takes a Bath\" have supplanted these solemnly formal 19th-century figures and their hygienically disadvantaged 19th-century lives. These seem, indeed, a different breed; in fact, diverse breeds. But mind that somebody once loved each and every one of them. And that their rich lives, lived out among the alpha figures of world literature, render our own comings and goings as so much figurative frolicking with so many metaphorical squeaky toys. IGOT SUCHANITCH   \"Ankle-biting cur!\" Pushkin shoved him out for ingratitude. Even kindly Chekhov finally tired of his yapping and passed him on to Dostoyevsky, who was driven to such despair by the ensuing domestic disruptions that he threw himself into writing \"Crime and Punishment\" \"just to escape into a happier realm,\" he later confessed. In the light of modern science, Suchanitch's didoes become understandable; he was almost certainly being driven half-mad by fleas. Not that the German-bred mischief-maker was without charm: that rakishly unkempt silvery-gray mane, those big, sparkling brown eyes, a restless bounding energy -- amid the pride of solemn literary lions of 19th-century St. Petersburg, he was a gay dog indeed. Alas, his literary output amounted to one brilliant, anguished fusillade against cats, \"Nyatski!\" (\"Hiss!\"), before he was drawn to science and became involved in psychological experiments -- to his everlasting regret -- with one Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, M.D. FIONA PURINA   Irish by descent, but adopted at a mere 8 weeks by a noble Italian family and raised in Rome, Fiona Purina was a creature of fierce territorial instincts who quickly made Roman society her jealous domain. But no pampered lap dog, she. Fiona was an agitator by the age of 6 and soon an outspoken essayist and pamphleteer against any and all abridgments of freedom for her and her kind. Yet the haughty household princess spurned the advances of what she called \"mongrels and strays\" and became the mistress of Garibaldi's pet, Pepe, who was sleek as a greyhound. But he was unable or unwilling to be monogamous; soon the fur flew, and the relationship ended in a veritable dogfight. Purina failed to mellow with age. Having impetuously wet King Umberto's pants leg, she was banished in disgrace to the countryside near Reggio Calabria. There she whiled away her remaining years, dozing in the sun in the dooryard, dreaming of the glory that had been Rome. SIR WAGSTAFF BARKER   Late-19th-century English letters owe Sir Wagstaff Barker much; it was he who once rescued the infant Chesterton from drowning in the Solent during a family picnic. Sir Wagstaff never spoke of his mother -- by all accounts a classic bitch, for all her impeccable breeding -- and never knew his father. Perhaps this explains a life of ceaseless wandering and almost suicidal athleticism. Certainly, a robust physicality (\"Muscular Canininity,\" Kipling called it) informed Barker's days and works. Up and out into the nearby woodlands before sunrise to splash through marsh and fen until exhausted, Barker lived and breathed and ate and celebrated nature with animal gusto to the end of his days. Indeed, his longtime companion, John Buchan, in whose household he was to become a permanent guest, thought he detected something obsessive in the big fellow's tireless pursuits. \"Birds and squirrels, squirrels and birds,\" he fulminated in his diary. \"He can think, he can dream, of nothing else.\" AMELIA UPLAND   \"Her long, wet nose quivers so,\" wrote Queen Victoria to a daughter after an audience with the shy and reclusive Amelia Upland, \"and her hair feels like a rug; yet even Rosebery  [ that is, the Earl of Rosebery, Prime Minister 1894-95 ]  is compelled to pat her on her head!\" The severe bombazine dress in this undated portrait symbolizes Miss Amelia Upland's austere spinsterhood, for an operation at an early age had made all hopes of a family impossible. Her long life was one ceaseless quest for affection, expressed in poems -- \"Bath Day,\" \"Comes the Cook,\" \"A Rumor of Mange\" -- that returned, again and again and yet again, to her beloved themes of family life in the Lake Country of her youth. Miss Upland seldom left her cozy corner under the stairs in the house where she was born, except to go swimming, and yet seldom has one so retiring been so widely loved. \"About life she had an acute sensitivity,\" eulogized England's poet laureate upon her passing, \"and her sense of smell was nothing to sneeze at, either.\" HECTOR LE CHIEN   Runt of a brawling Billancourt litter and cast out early to seek his own fate, Hector Le Chien soon made Montmartre his neighborhood and its fin de siecle boites and cafes his home. \"Mascot of the Demimonde,\" Zola called the pint-sized hobbledehoy. Le Chien was a beggar and a thief, notorious for his raffish demeanor (he was never known to bathe), his bad breath and a habit of furiously scratching himself until the furniture rattled. Small wonder that he was always in somebody's doghouse. Yet among Montmartre's innumerable poets and troubadours, his was a unique voice: keening his agonies and needs in impromptu recitals in one smoky cafe or another, he could still a room. Then, as the sympathy and praise engulfed him, Hector would invariably roll over onto his back, legs in the air, his mouth twisted into an otherworldly rictus of a grin. The stale croissant, the heel of a baguette that inevitably followed, were sustenance. For body and soul. BONAR KENNELWORTH KERR   \"Man has no better friend,\" warbled Thoreau. \"He gobbles his food,\" hissed Emily Dickinson. \"He spoke a language even I don't understand,\" harrumphed Edmund Wilson, whose massive critical surveys of American letters fail to so much as throw a bone to Bonar Kennelworth Kerr. True, his poems today may scan like doggerel, but in the New England of more than a hundred years ago, literary luminaries from Boston to Concord would instantly lay their papers down whenever Kennelworth Kerr came calling. His visits were memorable. \"That damnable animal Kennelworth comes by,\" huffed Longfellow, \"jumping up on the maid at the mere sight of some mutton scraps, bolting his meal, then licking her hands and face in a disgusting excess of what some call affection but I call servility.\" His biographer, Kibble, speculates that it was Mark Twain who taught him to smoke cigars as a parlor trick. Alas, it banished him thereafter from the salons and parlors of fastidious literary Boston, and his twilight years were spent snuffling for butts in the alleyways of Roxbury.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"The Big Top Returns To Connecticut Towns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/nyregion/the-big-top-returns-to-connecticut-towns.html","abstract":"  SOME people may still remember how in the 1930's and 40's the long, gleaming silver train of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus would roll into railroad yards in June, usually in the middle of the night.

Traditionally Ringling Brothers would start its Connecticut run in Stamford and then make stops in Bridgeport, Waterbury, New Haven, New London, Hartford and some smaller towns, mostly for one-day, two-show stands. Smaller circuses, such as King Brothers, Cole Brothers and the Clyde Beatty Circus, featuring the animal trainer, also visited the state often.

The couple, both employed, are rather informal, but they do not want to rent a cabin and cook or clean. And they do not want to spend a lot of money.    There should be a hundred solutions, given the rich variety of resorts within a day's drive of New York. Calls to a few hotels with advertising directed toward families produced a peculiar result: Some resorts that cater to families advertise a calm adult dinner with children in a separate dining room. But such resorts, in high season, do not want children so young they cannot eat separately from their parents. We will love you in May or September, they told the parents, but not in summer.

Everybody's either writing about native plants or saving water or healing the mind and body with wild plants found in the rain forest or Central Park. Some of these books are by people bent on defining the New American Garden (a catchy phrase that ought to be dropped right now), which has to be based on native plants. Though I'd love to, I don't yet see native grasses rising up out of the lawns in Hempstead, the only part of Long Island that once had a prairie, but there's certainly a different wind blowing this year. Instead of searching for the biggest white German bearded irises to stuff into a knockoff of Vita Sackville-West's white garden, gardeners are going back to their local historical societies to get a sense of how the land looked and what insects and animals lived on it before the suburbs, searching out the native viburnums and mulleins growing along the roadside and planting buffalo grass where the Kentucky blue used to go.   In THE NATURAL HABITAT GARDEN (Clarkson Potter, $40), by Ken Druse with Margaret Roach, the reader is led through American gardens that reflect terrain, climate and plants that were far more evident to Lewis and Clark than they are now to the average family driving across the continent. According to the authors' figures, 700,000 acres have been converted into parking lots. And the asphalt doesn't appear to be slowing, as the world's 5.4 billion population heads toward 8.2 billion by 2020. By then, a quarter of the earth's species may have vanished.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"Pena Is Missed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/sports/l-pena-is-missed-308641.html","abstract":"  To the Sport Editor:   Why is the earned run average of the Red Sox pitching staff so high this year?

The island can prompt strong feelings among Germans, some of whom perceive it as a symbol of the country's celebrated post-war wealth, and some of whom see it as a symbol of the evasions they believe that wealth tried to buy. Its reputation as an enclave of the rich, though, probably has more to do with attitude than with real expense.
