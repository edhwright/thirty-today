Several were memorable, but the one that has made the 66-year-old Paterno into something of a taskmaster this time was last year's bowl game. At the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami, Penn State lost to Stanford, 24-3, and disgraced itself, according to the coach.    \"Never again,\" said Paterno.   So this year the coach swept up his players and took them to Melbourne, Fla., for a week, where he put them through an August-style regimen, even two a day practices, for three days.   Prepare in Melbourne, play in Orlando. The Citrus, with Disney World nearby, is renowned for its ambitious social events for the athletes, what coaches call distractions. Paterno even whined on Wednesday about the players having to stand around too long in the sun at one event. Laying Blame    Distractions were partly to blame, he said, the last time Penn State played in the Citrus Bowl, on Jan. 1, 1988. Clemson won, 35-10.    Then there is Tennessee. On Christmas Day, Paterno spent seven hours in his hotel studying tapes of the Vols. His suspicions were clarified.   \"They have more speed and quickness than we do,\" Paterno said today. \"On defense too, even though everyone talks about their offense. It is going to be very difficult for us.\"   Paterno drew a confirmation from Craig Faulkner, the Volunteers' wide receiver, who will be catching passes thrown by Heath Shuler, the celebrated quarterback. Said Faulkner of the Nittany Lions' defenders, \"They don't have a lot of speed, so we have to be ready to use ours.\"   Paterno dismisses the Fiesta Bowl contest of two seasons ago in which Penn State defeated Tennessee, 42-17, thanks to a flurry of turnovers by the Vols after they had built a 17-7 lead.   Shuler was a freshman backup to Andy Kelly and went into the game late, completing one pass. He emerged as a force last season and helped destroy Boston College in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla., 38-23.    Shuler, who is from Bryson City, N.C., will announce on Jan. 9 if he will return to Tennessee for his senior season or enter the National Football League draft. Pro scouts say he could be a first-round selection, the first college quarterback picked over all.   His counterpart here, Kerry Collins, the Nittany Lions' quarterback, who is even bigger than Shuler -- 6 feet 5 inches and 235 pounds to 6-3, 212 -- has considered the prospect of Penn State having to play catch-up. \"We have to be effective throwing the ball,\" Collins said, \"or we're in for a long day. They have one of the best defenses we've seen this season.\"   Collins approved of the Melbourne drill camp. \"It helped us a lot,\" he said. \"It gave us a foundation. Down here, we've been going everywhere.\"   Party time, distraction time. Now it's game time. EXTRA POINTS    All 72,000 seats have been sold, at $40 a ticket. Penn State fans bought more than 10,000. . . . Either TERRY KILLENS or WILLIE SMITH will start at inside linebacker for the Nittany Lions, replacing BRIAN MONAGHAN, who did not make the trip after being charged with public intoxication by campus security personnel. . . . The backup to KERRY COLLINS at quarterback is CRAIG FAYAK , the place-kicker, and after him it would be the punter, V. J. MUSCILLO . Why? Because Coach JOE PATERNO chose in November to save a season of eligibility for the quarterback of the future, WALLY RICHARDSON, who had not played and who was redshirted. . . . PHIL FULMER, the Tennessee head coach, played for the Vols in a game against Penn State at Knoxville in 1971. Paterno was then in his 22d season as a Nittany Lions coach and his team was a 31-11 loser.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940101","headline":"Review/Operetta; Slightly Italianate British Goings-On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/01/arts/review-operetta-slightly-italianate-british-goings-on.html","abstract":"  A half-century of operas in the Sir Walter Scott mode of melodrama are mocked in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Ruddigore.\" To the ancestral ghosts, innocent maids, evil baronets, disputes over inheritance and rejected maidens driven to madness, the score adds hints of Weber, Donizetti, Rossini and lesser figures, amid a swirl of English ballads, folk dances, patter songs derived from Italian opera, and a hint of Protestant piety. Modern interpretations also have to contend with more than a hundred years of performance tradition, largely drawn from the now-extinct D'Oyly Carte productions.   On Thursday night, the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players gave this mixture a weightless, sure-footed treatment that was thoroughly fresh, turning melodrama into froth without veering into camp. Their performance was also thoroughly traditional in character, down to the mugging and dancing. The success was due largely to Albert Bergeret's accomplished direction and conducting -- this production is surely one of his company's crispest -- and to the accomplished singing of the cast, most of whom are familiar members of Nygasp (which is the acronym the company prefers).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940101","headline":"Fate of Trapped Dolphins Is Now Thought to Be Death","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/01/nyregion/fate-of-trapped-dolphins-is-now-thought-to-be-death.html","abstract":"  They have been around since August, a glistening, playful pod of dolphins that frolicked and fed in the shallow waters of the Shrewsbury River until it was too late: too late in the season for them to swim back to freedom in the Atlantic and too late for all of the bickering humans on the shore to agree on how, or even whether, to save them.

Let others scoff, we'll throw no stones   at Marla Maples or Chuck Jones.   And speaking here of throwing stuff,   Vince Coleman surely's heard enough.    What can one say to Andrew Dice Clay    but \"have yourself a very nice day\"?    Woody vs. Mia, the Donald and Ivana,   We could smirk but we don't wanna.   Instead we'll shout hip, hip, hooray!    Who needs glad tidings more than they?     Well, perhaps it's the politicos   still smarting from electoral woes.   Like Liz Holtzman, the ex-Comptroller.   We've got a strange urge to extol her.   Dave Dinkins, Bob Abrams and Andy Stein   \"take a salute at the end of the line.\"   While for New Jersey's Jim Florio,   here's some warm milk and an Oreo.   We do not want the vanquished dissed;   all such temptations we will resist.   But what of triumphs; can we laugh   at Ed Rollins and his boastful gaffe?   Snatching shame from victory's jaws   is surely worth a few guffaws.   Still, after so much has been said,   we'll just send our best to Ed.   Sol Wachtler, who once had it all,   reminds us how the mighty fall.   In jail, life's worse than on St. Croix;   we wish him comfort, if not Joy.     It's time to turn our contemplation    to the case that thrilled the nation.   We mean of course the suburban saga   of Amy and Joey going gaga.   Prurient interest, yes, indeed,   but lust excites much more than greed.   And while so many claim disgust,   We all read on because we must.   Hence we express our gratitude   To teen-age temptress and body shop dude.   No, we're not forgetting Mary Jo;   here's a hey nonny, nonny, and a ho ho ho.     In the world of arts and letters   We have seen some real go-getters.   Among the pros, not the beginners,   We have to mention Joe McGinniss.   Truth to tell, we've never met,   But if we should, it's safe to bet   He would so brilliantly infer    our plan to send him frankincense and myrrh.   Then Janet Malcolm, equally able,   for her, of course, a separate table.   Remember how she long insisted    that journalism's often twisted.   A counterpart of Heisenberg,    she'd have us doubt what we aver.   Indeterminacy she has reached,   In practice of what she has preached.     There is no lack of who to summon,   Howard Stern will keep things humming.   Rush Limbaugh will fuss and fume   As Leonard Jeffries works the room.   Leona Helmsley, once so lofty,   reveals herself a reborn softy.   And in the corner sits a loner,   the man who's been called George the Owner.   Pardoned by a President,   Has he some new cause to repent?     The muse is fleeting, it's busy season,   thus we're losing rhyme and reason.   Quick, cold champagne and eggs of sturgeon   For all who've offered us diversion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940101","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/01/nyregion/metro-digest-739090.html","abstract":"  NEW YORK CITY  FOR GIULIANI, CEREMONY MARKS GOAL  In an intimate ceremony in the East Side apartment of a Federal judge, Rudolph W.

It points the way to the Elefant Hotel, named after one of the town's most famous visitors. In December of 1550, an Indian elephant was trudging up to the 4,495-foot-high Brenner Pass, 27 miles to the north. The animal was a gift from King John III, the Fortunate, of Portugal to Emperor Ferdinand I; it had been shipped from Goa, then a Portuguese colony, to Genoa, and was being driven through the mountains in the same way Hannibal's African elephants crossed another section of the Alps nearly 1,800 years earlier.   In Bressanone-Brixen the pachyderm's handlers let it rest for two weeks in the barn of the High Field Inn, causing a local sensation. The inn's owner, the postmaster, Andra Posch, at once changed the name of his business to Inn at the Sign of the Elephant and commissioned a local painter, Lenhard Mair, to commemorate the event. The fresco portraying the animal and its escort of turbaned Indians can still be seen on the street facade of the hotel's old wing.

Crostini (little toasts) are popular in Italy, where stale bread does not automatically find its way into the bird feeder, or worse still, out with the trash. Instead, day-old bread is often toasted and used as a base for snacks made with various toppings. I like to combine goat cheese with sun-dried tomatoes and black-olive paste for an easy, last-minute hors d'oeuvre, which is put under the broiler and served hot.

Renowned for his musical unpredictability and cluster bombs of notes played at numbing decibels, Mr. Guy was considered too wild and overamplified for the owners of Chicago's Chess Records. Consequently, he was either used as a sideman for blues elders like Muddy Waters or toned down for his solo recordings. Until the album \"Stone Crazy\" was released in 1981, Mr. Guy was considered a great live act -- he played the guitar with his teeth and behind his back years before Jimi Hendrix -- who couldn't be captured on record. Today, however, all that has changed. Mr. Guy is a Grammy Award winner, and his album \"Damn Right I've Got the Blues\" is considered a blues milestone. The book of the same name, DAMN RIGHT I'VE GOT THE BLUES: Buddy Guy and the Blues Roots of Rock-and-Roll (Woodford Press, 660 Market Street, Suite 206, San Francisco, Calif. 94104, paper, $14.95), an oral biography written by the music journalist Donald E. Wilcock with the guitarist's cooperation, is a frank assessment of the life, many disappointments and rare hurrahs of Buddy Guy. Suffering from lingering insecurities about his own abilities, Mr. Guy even today insists there are dozens of musicians who can play better than he does. At the end of this slim volume he tells of buying his son a guitar so that he could learn to play like Prince. Mr. Guy recommended that the young man also listen to Jimi Hendrix. After watching a film clip of Hendrix, the son called his father and said: \"He said he learned from you. I didn't know you could play like that.\" Buddy Guy replied, \"You never asked.\" \nTOM GRAVES","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Norrington's Historical Trek Gathers Fresh Momentum","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/arts/recordings-view-norrington-s-historical-trek-gathers-fresh-momentum.html","abstract":"  After decades of apprenticeship with orchestras, opera companies and his own Schutz Choir, the conductor Roger Norrington emerged into the early-music big time in the mid-1980's. His vehicle was the Experience, a weekend-long immersion in a particular composer or work, consisting of concerts, lectures, chamber music, panel discussions and exhibitions.   These affairs proved enormously popular, but what really propelled Mr. Norrington to fame was his personality -- alert, intelligent, funny, inquisitive -- and the way those traits came through in his performances. He certainly represents the post-Toscanini manner in conducting that has defined the late-century early-music movement: he makes music fleetly, dramatically and intensely, with more attention to structural definition than to sensuous subtleties of phrasing.

Outraged? Maybe. Amused? Probably. Thrilled, most likely, at its impact on sales. (That edition of the novel spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list this fall, including four weeks at No. 1.) Wharton was a fiend for advertising and promotion. At the same time, she was fiercely protective of her privacy and insisted on fitting her writing career around her active social life. Her first novella, \"The Touchstone,\" centered on the real danger a \"lady novelist\" faced of being turned from a \"person\" to a \"personage\" by publicity; yet, as she wrote it, she hectored her publisher for ever more ads. Between her demands and her demurs, Wharton became the very model of a market-wise, talented \"problem author.\" Her side of this relationship has been repeatedly described by her biographers. Here, I offer the publisher's revenge.\n\nWharton's editor during the early years of this fan dance with the public was one William Crary Brownell (1851-1928), a cultured and thoughtful literary critic who was as jealous of his privacy as any late Victorian gentleman could be. They were a good match: her insistence against his courtly evasions, his reticence against her social skills. Brownell was employed by Charles Scribner's Sons as its \"literary adviser,\" something like a modern executive editor. He and Wharton began working together with her first book, \"The Decoration of Houses\" (Scribners, 1897). Co-written with Ogden Codman, the architect who helped her to build a summer house in Newport, R.I., the book was an illustrated expression of their philosophy of tasteful, uncluttered decoration. As it happened, Brownell spent summers in Newport as well and his first working contacts with Wharton took place there. Writing to his boss, Charles Scribner, he left a record of Wharton at work that reads like a farce.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Exploring the Links of Color, Lines and Forms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/art-exploring-the-links-of-color-lines-and-forms.html","abstract":"  THE paintings hanging in the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford are as blithe as a flower show and some even include floral shapes.

Much that has gone wrong in Africa springs from causes beyond African control; that, too, needs to be recognized.

The festival will lead off with Doug Elkins's \"Scott, Queen of Marys\" to a score by Mio Morales, with whom the choreographer is working for the first time.

Then my mother told me about Ivor Spencer, of the Ivor Spencer International Butler School. He's British and comes to the United States once a year. That year, the course was being given in Washington. It was a monthlong course that cost $6,000. I stayed at the Y.M.C.A. for $25 a night; I had to pay for parking, food. \nHOW I GOT THE MONEY: I was working as a security guard in a hospital, making a lot of overtime. I had a Porsche. I drove over to Brooklyn, left the car there, went to a club, and when I came back the Porsche was stripped to the bone. My insurance company said the value of the car was $16,000; $10,000 went to the bank and I had $6,000 for the butler school. \nWHAT I LEARNED:How to lay tables; how to steam all the wrinkles out of the tablecloth; how to pack for a trip; never to wear cologne or jewelry; to be friendly but never familiar. He taught us how the butler can be the star of a dinner party without showing up the host. \nMY FIRST JOB: I met two executives who were hiring at the Renaissance Hotel, so I lucked out and got a spot making 30 grand. Butlers were something hotels were starting to use in New York. I was there for about a year. I hated it, so I went to the St. Regis, and it was a walk in the park.\nPROBLEM WITH HOTELS: You're forced to put on airs -- constantly.

He left the theorizing to Robert Venturi and the celebrity status to Michael Graves and Philip Johnson; his mission, as he saw it, was to preach a gospel of kindness and common sense.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Enter Laughing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/books/enter-laughing.html","abstract":"PADDY CLARKE \nHA HA HA \nBy Roddy Doyle.\n282 pp. New York:\nViking. $20.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"A Shared Sense of Pride","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/movies/l-schindler-s-list-a-shared-sense-of-pride-721328.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I was reassured by Bernard Weinraub's article \"Steven Spielberg Faces the Holocaust\"  [ Dec. 12 ]  because it personalized Mr. Spielberg's life experience and explained how it led to creating \"Schindler's List.\" I have seen the movie; it is a masterpiece.

Yet all through the century, people were racing and pouring into urban centers. In 1800, not one city in the western world had a million inhabitants, but by 1850, Paris did, and London had more than two million. By 1900, 11 cities, including New York, Berlin, Tokyo and Calcutta, had expanded beyond a million. Photographers, like all city dwellers, resorted to strategies to avoid the crowds: Eugene Atget, for one, would get up very early to find Paris pure.   Between about 1890 and 1915, photographers made three discoveries about cities that still influence urban imagery. One: that urban areas were dangerous and destructive to their inhabitants. (Jacob Riis's photographs of tenement life came out around 1890.) Two: that the undistinguished corners of metropolis and the life of its streets were piquant subject matter. Three: that urban geometries were the perfect modernist subject, and that rather than documenting the city's splendors the camera could cull abstractions and personal artistic statements from its surfaces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Bypassing Busy Highways Can Ruin Neighborhoods","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/l-bypassing-busy-highways-can-ruin-neighborhoods-755923.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   What was James Barron thinking about in \"The Road Wars\" (Dec. 19) when he directed drivers off highways onto the city's residential streets?

His sensibility was shaped by his experiences in World War I. In the French infantry he was wounded on the front line and had to spend the night next to a decomposing German soldier. From that experience he had what might be described as contradictory epiphanies. He began to regard men as sadists and beasts seeking death, but he also had a vision of intense bright light. Both of these poles would influence his art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/books/in-short-fiction-721689.html","abstract":"  MURDER IN MISSISSIPPI WOLF WHISTLE By Lewis Nordan.

The melting-pot era of Studio 54, when everyone waited behind the velvet ropes together, evolved into a city tethered by velvet ropes of the imaginary kind. First, rap culture emerged; then, hip-hop and rave. The 60's were revived, then the 70's, and from the ashes of 1980's decadence arose Generation X, a group of young network television dropouts who didn't buy the traditional marketing methods used by magazines and advertising agencies.   From the start, Paper's independent, unpredictable approach to covering the arts, clubs, music and style has appealed to a young audience suspicious of the corporate world. That pull, it seems, is still strong today. \"There is this reaction in Generation X against synthesizing, Corporate America and artificiality,\" said Kim Hastreiter, who has shared the titles of editor and publisher with David Hershkovits since the magazine's inception. \"Paper,\" she said \"is not synthetic.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Small Steps to a Greater New York;\nWork Is Work Is Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/opinion/small-steps-to-a-greater-new-york-work-is-work-is-work.html","abstract":"New Yorkers argue about everything.

The collapse, which only a few years ago was typically triggered by nuclear war, is now more likely to be blamed on environmental or political mismanagement. Such stories tend to focus on what happens after the old social order falls apart; the ensuing chaos offers a heady freedom that tempts many writers to make up their own rules as they go along. In her fine new novel, PARABLE OF THE SOWER (Four Walls Eight Windows, $19.95), Octavia E. Butler accepts a more difficult challenge: poising her story on the brink of change, she tries to imagine a new social order at its moment of conception.   The opening chapters, set in southern California in the year 2024, depict a society that has continued to unravel from our own day but that nevertheless remains recognizable. The middle-income community where 15-year-old Lauren Oya Olamina and her family live has a high wall around it; the price that water peddlers charge to street people has gone up again; there's a new drug called pyro that prompts addicts to get their kicks by setting fires. But daily life by and large follows familiar grooves, and it takes an especially keen eye to see the great disaster looming.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"The Menu Wars, Continued","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-update-the-menu-wars-continued.html","abstract":"  The menu wars continue, but Empire Szechuan seems to be picking up the spoils.

It is not simply \"treated household sewage,\" nor is it \"inadvertently\" contaminated with industrial wastes.   In fact, the major problem in sludge processing is that these potentially hazardous industrial wastes are an integral and permanent component of the sludge itself.   Industrial plants disgorge their byproducts into the same sewer systems as our dwellings, so that many metals (e.g., lead, arsenic, copper, nickel, cadmium) and organic chemicals (e.g., PCB's, benzene compounds, ethers, formaldehyde, dioxins) are inherently present in sewage in concentrations that can vary dramatically from day to day. Some of these substances can be toxic in very small amounts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Fighting the Export of Stolen Cars in Port Newark","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/fighting-the-export-of-stolen-cars-in-port-newark.html","abstract":"IT was 2 o'clock on a sunny Friday afternoon when Matthew Hoishman walked outside his home to drive his 1992 Mitsubishi Diamante to the local grocery store.
