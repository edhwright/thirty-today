They are the voices of other representatives of the Cuban-American community who advocate talks with the Cuban leader and oppose harsh measures like a naval blockade of the island, saying they want to avoid further hardship for those in Cuba.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940831","headline":"Transit Officer Gets Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/31/nyregion/transit-officer-gets-surgery.html","abstract":"  Officer Desmond Robinson of the transit police, critically wounded by a New York City police officer last week in a shooting incident in the subway, underwent three hours of surgery yesterday to repair damage to one of his kidneys.

The movie, which opened today at the Film Forum, lets its images speak for themselves. It shows how the bulls used in combat are bred to be hot-tempered and aggressive. Long before they enter the ring, they are confined in pens where they are teased and prodded in order to make them more short-tempered.

The trend is now toward large tap ensembles and large-scale choreography, and much of the individuality of the form is getting lost. Tap dancers once learned the art on city street corners, not in studios, and it was everyone for himself.

After two decades as a hard-rock hit maker, Aerosmith is perfectly at home in that realm, perfectly familiar but by no means stale.    Aerosmith has enough commercial clout to have been a headliner at Woodstock '94; in the movie \"Wayne's World 2,\" it had already headlined the fictional rock festival Waynestock, proving it doesn't take itself too seriously. While Aerosmith has held on to some old fans, its songs about unbridled lust keep drawing new throngs of teen-agers; Steven Tyler, its 46-year-old lead singer, mocked his high-school principal at one point. Yet between, and sometimes during, its leers, Aerosmith brings intelligence and wit to music that never forgets to be stupid fun.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940831","headline":"The Fracturing of the Middle Class","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/31/opinion/the-fracturing-of-the-middle-class.html","abstract":"  Since last Labor Day, the economy has generated more than 2.5 million jobs for Americans. But despite this progress, long-term trends are splitting the old middle class into three new groups: an underclass largely trapped in center cities, increasingly isolated from the core economy; an overclass, those in a position to ride the waves of change; and in between, the largest group, an anxious class, most of whom hold jobs but are justifiably uneasy about their own standing and fearful for their children's futures.    The fundamental fault line through the labor force divides workers by education and skills. As recently as 1979, a male college graduate earned 49 percent more than a man with only a high school diploma -- a sizable difference, to be sure, but not too much for the two to share the label \"middle class.\" By 1992, the gap had widened to 83 percent, and the notion of common prospects had faded considerably.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940831","headline":"N.B.A. Rejects Dudley Pact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/31/sports/sports-people-basketball-nba-rejects-dudley-pact.html","abstract":"  As expected, the National Basketball Association yesterday disapproved the contract that center CHRIS DUDLEY signed with the Portland Trail Blazers on the grounds that it violates league salary cap rules.

The proposal encourages advertising for babies as if they were used refrigerators. It permits paying a baby broker to match a would-be parent with a vulnerable mother.

The decision, handed down by Judge David N. Edelstein in Federal District Court in Manhattan, is the first test of the Federal statute, which went into effect in June 1991.   The case pitted three sculptors -- John J. Veronis, John Swing and John Carter, all in their early 30's -- against Helmsley-Spear, the owner of the former Macy's warehouse at 47-44 31st Street in Long Island City. In December 1991, the artists were commissioned by the building's leaseholder to create an installation in the lobby, and over the course of two years, using recycled materials and discarded objects, they set about constructing a brightly colored multimedia installation with an ecological theme. Threat to Dismantle    When the leaseholder went bankrupt and Helmsley-Spear resumed management of the building in April 1994, representatives of the real-estate company ordered the artists off the premises and said it would dismantle the sculpture, which has never been completed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"Haiti Releases Donated Fuel for Relief Services","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/world/haiti-releases-donated-fuel-for-relief-services.html","abstract":"  After a month of delays, the military-appointed Haitian Government released some 500,000 gallons of fuel today that had been donated by other nations to run charity food centers, hospitals and other relief services.

There is one glaring exception to all this success: ridership on city buses is down almost 50 percent over the last 30 years.

When this great French director arrived in Hollywood at the start of World War II, he was not prepared for the way studios would cramp his brilliant, graceful style. Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, actually took over the editing of Renoir's first American film, \"Swamp Water,\" a story of love and injustice in the Georgia bogs. Yet Renoir did more than survive in Hollywood. He adopted the whole country, if not its methods of film making, and died at home in Beverly Hills in 1979, at the age of 84.    The paradox of the auteur in Hollywood is just a piece of Renoir's huge, eventful life. He was born 100 years ago, on Sept. 15, 1894, and his career spans the history of movie-making itself.

A report this week by New York's Citizens Budget Commission challenges this stereotype in useful and enlightening ways. It shows that women on welfare make up a far smaller percentage of the poor than popular wisdom would have it. It also confirms what previous studies have shown: Medicaid, not welfare, is the prime source of runaway spending on poverty.   Welfare mothers are routinely portrayed as slackers who make up the bulk of the poor and soak up more money every year. The fact is that only one in four poor households in New York City is headed by a single parent; welfare payments, when adjusted for inflation, have actually declined by 30 percent since 1972.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940902","headline":"Pentagon Estimates It Will Cost $427 Million to Invade Haiti","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/02/world/pentagon-estimates-it-will-cost-427-million-to-invade-haiti.html","abstract":"  Pentagon experts have estimated that an invasion of Haiti would cost $427 million on top of nearly $200 million already spent rescuing Haitians who have fled the country by boat and building camps for them, Defense Department officials said today.

This strong bill brings together three generations of avant-garde musicians. Mr. Conrad, best known for his work in the 1960's with the Minimalist composer La Monte Young, rarely performs nowadays. But his few recent concerts, where he stands silhouetted behind a screen and plays long, overtone-filled drones on the violin while a small, homemade mechanical contraption bows a second violin, have been loud, intense and beautiful. Mr. Sharp is a multi-instrumentalist who has been performing in New York City for 15 years, improvising with and composing for scores of musicians and creating dense musical textures out of a double-necked guitar and a sound sampler. Mr. O'Rourke, who also plays in the abstract rock band Gastr del Sol, is among the youngest brains in the avant-garde, working with field recordings and processing his guitar playing not to make music but to create a landscape of sound.

The Reverend Horton Heat is the genre's best known newcomer, most likely because it hired alternative-rock personalities like Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers and Al Jourgensen of Ministry to produce its records. It opened its set with \"Baddest of the Bad\" from its new album, \"Liquor in the Front\" (Interscope), paving the way for a battery of hyperbolic party anthems about alcohol, drugs and sex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940902","headline":"Yankees Trade A Reliever And Get One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/02/sports/baseball-yankees-trade-a-reliever-and-get-one.html","abstract":"  Three hours after Paul Gibson received the news from General Manager Gene Michael yesterday that he had been traded from the Yankees to Milwaukee for a player to be determined later, the pitcher was still confused. Gibson's dream of playing in the World Series for the Yankees had been placed in peril by the players' strike and now it was obliterated by the trade.   Explaining that they needed another right-handed reliever, the Yanks unloaded the left-handed Gibson and then acquired Scott Bankhead from Boston for an undisclosed amount of money and a player to be named later. Both minor trades were made about an hour before Wednesday's midnight deadline, but Michael said that the three teams agreed to delay the announcements until yesterday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940902","headline":"Israel and Morocco Take Fledgling Step Toward Diplomatic Relations","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/02/world/israel-and-morocco-take-fledgling-step-toward-diplomatic-relations.html","abstract":"  Israel and Morocco took the first formal step toward diplomatic relations today, making the kingdom in northern Africa the only Arab country other than Egypt to establish official ties with the Jewish state.

At the same time, shorter days and longer shadows cast a melancholy spell, and put the mind in an elegiac mood.   Either way, the summer-ending three-day weekend demands a response. Who can blame America for scrambling to snatch the last morsel of pleasure from the season's closing jaws? This is it. The party is over. Summer is gone.
