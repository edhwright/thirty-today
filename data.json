Pundits and politicians have taken literally what people tell the pollsters, only to find eventually that what they mean is far different. \n\nThe most striking example is public support for universal health insurance. Most opinion polls show a large majority in favor: the average level of support in 17 national polls is 71 percent, an impressive majority -- if the support is solid.

Four years ago the freewheeling former Senator Weicker bolted the Republican Party and won the governorship as the candidate of his own third party. This unhorsed the Democrats, who had held the office for 16 years, and infuriated Republicans, who felt their time had come. He has withdrawn now, after one term, but state politics is not on its way back to normal. There are four contenders to be reckoned with this November.    Both Democrats and Republicans went through primary battles to pick their gubernatorial candidates. Democrats rejected the party convention's nominee and anointed Bill Curry, the State Comptroller. Republicans confirmed their convention nominee, former Congressman John Rowland, but his primary opponent got 32 percent of the vote.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940917","headline":"More Police for Same Taxes In Suffolk's Proposed Budget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/nyregion/more-police-for-same-taxes-in-suffolk-s-proposed-budget.html","abstract":"  The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J.

Treadwell has recovered from back spasms that sidelined him Thursday and is expected to play Sunday against the visiting Washington Redskins.   The Giants' kicking game is coming off a down Sunday, and they must contend with the Redskins' special teams, which are hot. One of the big reasons Washington was able to hammer New Orleans, 38-24, last week was the play of Brian Mitchell, a punt and kickoff returner. Mitchell, a five-year veteran out of Southwestern Louisiana, returned a punt 76 yards for a touchdown and also raced 86 yards with a kickoff to set up another score. In all, Mitchell had 225 yards in returns. He was named the National Football Conference's special teams player of the week.   What worries the Giants is how Mitchell was untouched on his touchdown run and on the kickoff return. No Saints player got a hand on him until the end of the play. Whether the Saints' special teams are that bad or the Redskins' that good remains to be seen. Giants Coach Dan Reeves says he thinks he knows the answer: Washington is that good.   Reeves gives a lot of the credit to the Redskins' special teams coach, Pete Rodriguez, who is considered to be one of the best in the business. Everywhere Rodriguez has coached, the special teams have always been special. In 1992, when he was with the Cardinals, the special teams were always rated No. 1 or among the best in the National Football League. That season, he was named special teams coach of the year by the N.F.L. Under Rodriguez, punter Rich Camarillo and returner Johnny Bailey made the Pro Bowl.   When Rodriguez was with the Raiders in 1988-89, Tim Brown made the Pro Bowl by leading the league in kickoff returns. The Raiders were also among the top three in both kickoff returns and punt coverage.   \"Pete Rodriguez does a super job,\" said Reeves. \"He was great when he was in Phoenix and now he does a great job.   \"Norv Turner is a big part of that, too,\" Reeves added about the Redskins' first-year head coach and former Cowboys assistant, \"because Dallas had great special teams. Our guys have to match that.\"   Against the Cardinals, Giants punter Mike Horan averaged just 30.6 yards and one attempt was blocked. The left-footed punter probably had one of his poorest performances in his 11-year career.   \"I've been around Mike now for a lot of years,\" said Reeves, who coached Horan in Denver for eight years before bringing him to the Giants last season. \"That's the worst night he ever had kicking the football. He's bounced back in the past and we expect him to bounce back again.\" Players Go, but Rivalries Stay    Despite the massive player movement brought about by free agency, rivalries still remain strong. The Redskins and the Giants will probably be that way no matter which players are on the field. Dan Reeves said the reason is simple.   \"I think my experience is that with teams competing for a division, the rivalry just gets bigger,\" said the Giants coach.   The Giants have played the Redskins more times (122 regular-season meetings) than any other opponent, followed by Philadelphia (119) and Arizona (103). The Giants and the Redskins have played each other at least twice a season since 1932 except in 1967 and 1969 when the two teams met once.   Reeves knows something about this rivalry and also about the Giants-Dallas rivalry when he was a player with the Cowboys. Reeves was asked what he thought about the Giants going back to their old uniforms on Sunday, as part of the N.F.L.'s Throwbacks Weekend. The outfit features the \"NY\" on the helmets, instead of \"Giants.\"   \"We used to beat them bad when they had those uniforms,\" said Reeves. Good Luck With the Chuck    Maybe the biggest rules change to affect teams is the 5-yard chuck, where defensive backs cannot touch a wide receiver 5 yards past the line of scrimmage.   The Giants have responded by moving their defensive backs closer to the line of scrimmage and telling them to make sure they get a hand on the receiver within the first 5 yards to disrupt the pattern.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940917","headline":"Knicks Lose Harper to Bulls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-lose-harper-to-bulls.html","abstract":"  Ron Harper, who had been pursued by the Knicks, signed with the Chicago Bulls last night.

With a listlessness at odds with his usual sidewalk-preacher oratorical style, Mr. Clinton couldn't drum up one compelling reason that a tiny nation whose economy is in shambles and whose military is a shadow of our own posed a risk to national security.

In October 1935, the United States imposed an arms embargo against both Italy and Ethiopia (the well-armed aggressor and the under-armed victim). This Presidential action, supported by Congress, was supposed to impede the spread of war. Instead, it encouraged aggression, first in Spain and then Germany.

year. Now he threatens to sabotage open trade -- by blocking approval of the international trade accord the Administration signed last April in Marrakesh, Morocco. That is an odd stance for the leader of the party that has traditionally stood for free trade. But Mr. Dole appears more intent on humiliating President Clinton before the November elections than on serving the nation's 250 million other citizens. The danger is that U.S. delay encourages protectionists abroad who desperately search for any excuse to sidetrack ratification of free trade.   The Administration bears some blame for Mr. Dole's chokehold. It waited too long to make a key concession. There are only about 20 working days left before Congress breaks for elections; the time crunch puts Mr. Dole in charge. He can say that he wants a trade pact this year -- mollifying his big-business and farm constituencies that have the most to gain from the Marrakesh accord -- while dallying so that the legislation dies from neglect.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"On Sunday; Behind a Bar, A Mellow Eye On the World","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/nyregion/on-sunday-behind-a-bar-a-mellow-eye-on-the-world.html","abstract":"  THE Fox was at the door, opening up the neighborhood bar in Queens Village where the previous night's dankness hovered within like a brooding, boozy ghost.

As one of the premiere exponents of Butoh, Japan's dominant experimental dance style, Hakutobo flaunts the slow movements, grotesque grimaces and underlying sense of desolation associated with that form.

And so even as his television ads seek to persuade undecided voters, Mr. Cuomo's schedulers have him sprinting from union halls to black churches, from yeshivas to Caribbean parades.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"On a Stroll in the Park, A Brush With the Law","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/nyregion/l-on-a-stroll-in-the-park-a-brush-with-the-law-281255.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I am not a drug dealer.

Individually, the works have been heard many times, and the second overture has become a mini-warhorse under its more familiar title, \"Carnival.\" But the Philharmonic last performed the three together, under Anton Seidl, in 1895, three years after the American premiere, led by Dvorak himself at Carnegie Hall.   The curious history of these overtures raises questions involving everything from the nature of multimovement works and program music to issues of taste and reception. They were written in 1891 as a single large work with a single opus number. Dvorak was celebrating his 50th birthday to much acclaim, and he clearly wished to make a major statement, perhaps even to rival his venerable compatriot Bedrich Smetana.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"U.N.

But the painting's success, writes Barbara Haskell, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, was Stella's albatross. \"Heralded as 'the most successful piece of American modernism,' \" she writes in JOSEPH STELLA (Whitney Museum of American Art/Abrams, $60), \"it was also cited as an achievement Stella never surpassed.\" Inspired by Walt Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe and Hart Crane, Stella imbued his Futurist paintings with spiritual significance; he was also, Ms. Haskell writes, \"alone among the Futurists in aligning the subject matter of technological life to a style that encapsulated the dynamism and speed which technology engendered.\" Stella was always an outsider, even in the artistic community, and in the early 1920's he turned away from New York and from modernism, spending most of the rest of his life in Europe. There he executed paintings of symbolic landscapes and religious images that would dominate his work until his death -- work that was largely ignored. Indeed, one critic argued that it was easy to agree Stella had talent, but not so easy to agree on the use he made of it. What is clear, however, from this richly illustrated book is Stella's versatility: the superb draftsmanship of his early sketches of Ellis Island immigrants, the famous Futurist paintings, the fine collages never exhibited during his lifetime, as well as the later landscape and religious paintings. As Ms. Haskell concludes, \"It is perhaps only now, in a post-modernist era, that the baroque exuberance and unrestrained theatricality of Stella's art can be fully understood and embraced.\" Her elegantly and persuasively written book makes one hope so.\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Holy Bull Romps by 5 Lengths in a Bid to Be No. 1","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/sports/horse-racing-holy-bull-romps-by-5-lengths-in-a-bid-to-be-no-1.html","abstract":"  In a smashing performance that ended his racing year and may have won two championships in less than two minutes, Holy Bull dazzled a field of seven all-star rivals at Belmont Park yesterday as he swept to a five-length victory over Devil His Due in the Woodward Stakes.

The fact is that Gauguin became Gauguin not among the sun-drenched Polynesians but earlier, among the Bretons, back in France, where natives do their fishing in the icy North Atlantic.   The history of 19th-century art in France is dotted with stories of painters who thrived in small towns near the sea -- Seurat at Gravelines, Monet at Etretat. For Gauguin it was Pont-Aven, a picturesque Brittany port.

She stands -- dances, really -- as she paints while Mr. Brown's music fills the room. Some subjects like the music; others don't. How they react, she said, definitely affects how the painting comes out. Mr. Brown was so important to her that she wrote to him from her home in Israel and was eventually invited to his place in Augusta, Ga., to paint him.

Strong took over as director of the Queens Borough Public Library. As State Librarian of California for the last 14 years, Mr. Strong oversaw a system that carried books in 100 languages. Last week, Mr. Strong sat for an interview at the Flushing Library. Here are some of his comments. Q.  In what new ways will the Queens Library serve its members?  A.  We want to be sure that every branch is an on-ramp onto the information superhighway so that people can use the libraries from home computers, from schools, from offices or in the library itself -- that they have access equitably with all the people across the United States. Many people can't purchase home computers, or don't have that capability at their workplace. If you're a student who can't afford a computer, you're also disenfranchised. So the library can be a common ground, a leveling influence. Q.  How will you start doing this specifically?  A.  We will initially train our staff to do that surfing, getting around the Internet, getting the answers in, very likely in the same way we've delivered them to the public before. Our on-line catalog, as we bring that out throughout the entire system over the next several years, will have an Internet connection in it, so that someone using our on-line catalogue can not only find out what is available in our collection but will have access to our resources in CD-ROM, and other connections that will definitely emerge. Q.  What problems do you encounter when a library tries to serve a community as diverse as Queens?  A.First and foremost, we're developing collections in many languages other than English -- and collections that represent not only the popular new material in those languages but the classics that stand up along Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer. . . . One of things I've learned over the years is that people come to a library, particularly a new user, with very different backgrounds. The Russian population comes with a strong tradition of public library service. . . . Someone coming from a Central American country or other third world countries -- while there may have been libraries, they were often for the elite and educated in society. The practice in those countries is also that you don't borrow anything . . . because books are so scarce or because the contents of books were so controlled by the regimes in power. . . . So an initial step is to show how we use a public library in Queens.

The fish form that he has used in several projects, Gehry told the historian Thomas Hines, owes something to his childhood memory of gefilte fish, and of the live carp, soaking in the family bathtub, from which his grandmother prepared it. And for some years now the architect has paid homage to his native country by devoting weekend mornings to ice hockey sessions with his sons. Gehry's new Anaheim Ice Rink, which goes into construction this week, is thus a kind of symbolic architectural homecoming for this transplanted child of the north.   But skating itself, John Cheever observed, can feel like a homecoming, precisely because it cuts the skater loose from roots. In \"Oh What a Paradise It Seems,\" Cheever writes about watching a group of skaters \"completely absorbed in the illusion that fleetness and grace were in their possession and had only to be revealed.\" On the ice, gravity is suspended; minimal exertion produces maximum propulsion. Perhaps no other sport is so viscerally analogous to freedom, and the exhilaration it induces springs from the sensation that this freedom is a natural state of being. The act of holding the body upright puts the whole world in balance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Sheila Delaney, Anthony DiNota","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/style/weddings-sheila-delaney-anthony-dinota.html","abstract":"  Sheila Kathleen Delaney, an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, was married yesterday to Anthony Stephen DiNota, a staff lawyer in the Bronx office of the civil division of the Legal Aid Society.

Murphy was growing up on Staten Island, he used to shoot hoops in the backyard of his grandfather's clapboard house on Bowen Street. His grandfather was a retired New York City police sergeant, and he lived across the street from a field where a dozen red-brick apartment buildings went up in the 1960's.   It was in that federally subsidized housing complex, the Park Hill Houses, that Ernest Sayon, a 22-year-old black man, died in April in a struggle with police officers, touching off a week of protests and allegations of police brutality.   Now, Mr. Murphy is conducting a grand jury investigation to determine whether the police officers behaved properly or exerted undue force and should be charged with a crime.   The case is the biggest test Mr. Murphy has faced in his 11 years in the post, historically the least prominent of the five district attorneys' offices in the city. As a sign of the tensions surrounding the case, he has been accused of delaying the grand jury proceedings to prevent a decision during the hot days of the summer.   Mr. Murphy said that he expected to hear from about 100 witnesses, altogether, and that a conclusion is still weeks away.   Although the proceedings are secret, many witnesses have publicly given conficting accounts of what happened, and Mr. Murphy said that so far the jury did not appear to be leaning one way or the other. \"We're all over the lot,\" he said in his office overlooking New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty.   The case is being played out on an unlikely terrain. Quieter, smaller and more bucolic than the other boroughs, Staten Island has the city's smallest percentage of minority residents -- although it is growing -- and the highest percentage of police officers. Crime has been rising, and some old-timers blame the growing minority population for the deterioration.   Although the two main figures in the fatal struggle, Mr. Sayon and Officer Donald Brown, are black, the death of Mr. Sayon has taken on racial overtones, and some Park Hill residents urged that a special prosecutor be appointed.   State law required that the 23-member grand jury hearing the Sayon case be drawn from a pool that reflects the population mix of the community. And for many people, that suggests a fundamental bias on Staten Island. \"This is a white borough,\"' said Jerome X. O'Donovan, one of Staten Island's three City Council members, all of whom are white.   \"There are also lots of cops out here, and there's a perception that, for those reasons, the process won't be fair,\" added Mr. O'Donovan, whose district includes the Park Hill Houses. \"Bill Murphy understands the perception and, if anything, he's going to do a very thorough job because of that.\"   Others are not so sure. Chrisida Howard, the president of the Park Hill Tenants' Association, said her affection for the borough had been tempered by searing experiences of racial prejudice, and she said she was far from certain that the grand jury would render an impartial decision. \"My hope, my dream,\" she said, \"is that we do get justice.\"   But she added: \"I can't know that we will. It is just my hope and my dream.\"   Mr. Murphy's experience with grand juries goes back to his youth, when his father, an accountant, was repeatedly called as a grand juror. It was his father's dinner-table accounts of the proceedings, Mr. Murphy said, that first gave him the idea that he might find satisfaction in a career in the law. Over the years, Mr. Murphy has become such an authority on grand juries that he conducts classes on them for young lawyers.   He acknowledges that prosecutors greatly influence grand juries because they conduct the proceeding, question all witnesses and explain the legal choices, all without the participation of lawyers with opposing arguments. But he says the courthouse cliche that a prosecutor could persuade a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich is ridiculous.   \"We don't seek a conclusion nor direct a conclusion.\" Mr. Murphy said. \"We tell the grand jury what they may consider and what their options are. But what they do is their decision.\"   Although Mr. Murphy is directing the grand jury investigation, evidence is being presented to the panel by the chief of his investigations bureau, Mario Mattei.   Mr. Sayon, whom neighbors described as a small-time drug dealer, died on the balmy evening of April 29 after members of a special drug unit forced him to the ground, face down, and cuffed his hands behind his back. The police had gone to the Park Hill Houses looking for another man wanted on drug charges. They were startled by an explosion, which later turned out to have been caused by a firecracker, and confronted Mr. Sayon, who was then on probation on charges of drug possession and resisting arrest.   Mr. Murphy heard the widely divergent accounts as to whether Mr. Sayon struggled with the officers and decided that a grand jury would have to sort out what had happened. The New York City Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, ruled that Mr. Sayon's death was a homicide caused by pressure on his neck and chest. The central question for the grand jury is whether the officers' action was justified.   Trying to ease the tensions caused by the killing, Guy V. Molinari, the borough president, has been meeting on Thursday nights with leaders from the Park Hill Houses in a group that calls itself Ambassadors for Peace. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton have met with the Ambassadors several times, and through the group Mr. Molinari has been reaching out to the thousands of Park Hill residents.   Hattie Smith-Davis, a registered nurse and Pentecostal minister in her late 60's who is one of the Ambassadors, said the meetings have shown good faith and have helped bring the community together.   \"I don't believe they would be meeting with us if they did not really and truly want peace,\" Ms. Smith-Davis said.   Mr. Murphy has been criticized by Park Hill residents and civil libertarians for permitting the long summer recess for the grand jury. Some charged that he deliberately delayed the proceedings to avoid any possible confrontation over a conclusion reached during the summer. Others said the reason was that witnesses' memories would fade as time passed, to the benefit of the police.   But Mr. Murphy said he had no choice because many jurors had previously scheduled vacations. \"There was no design to delay the grand jury's determination,\" he said. \"We simply couldn't get them together during the period of the summer.\"   Victoria Shuford, a member of a Park Hill Tenants' Association who came to Staten Island as a child in the early 1970's from Newark, N.J., said many are concerned about the composition of the grand jury, which, citing the secrecy of the proceedings, Mr. Murphy refused to discuss. Some of those who have testified say the grand jury is nearly all white.   \"The people here don't feel the grand jury can make the proper decisions,\" Ms. Shuford said, \"because they don't really know what goes on in Park Hill,\" where nearly everyone is black.   Christine Lee, a 22-year-old former cashier and photographer's assistant who has been disabled since her back was accidentally broken by police officers who knocked her off her feet as they were chasing a suspect in the Park Hill Houses three years ago, testified before the grand jury in June. She said she felt that both the prosecutor and at least one of the jurors, a white woman, were hostile and tried to intimidate her.   \"He was twisting words around,\" Ms. Lee said of the prosecutor. She said she saw only one black person among the grand jurors and was not sure if there were any Hispanic jurors or members of other minority groups.   Over the years, Staten Island has been a magnet for New York City police officers, including Mr. Murphy's grandfather, William L. Murphy Sr. The District Attorney said that before he was born his grandfather had retired from the police force, so he never saw him in uniform and they never talked about the force. He is proud of his grandfather's work as a police officer, Mr. Murphy said, but he said it would not affect his attitude toward the officers before the grand jury.   \"My pride in the police in my background means that all I'm looking for is someone who can measure up to what I picture my grandfather to be,\" Mr. Murphy said, \"and that was a good and honest cop.\"   The Police Department says 3,785 officers live on Staten Island, and Mr. Murphy says they are a substantial factor in Staten Island's tranquillity.   It is also a reason that some Park Hill residents feel a Staten Island grand jury is likely to look at a police officer's problems with a great deal of understanding.   But Mr. Murphy has confidence in the grand jury process.   \"It is virtually impossible to thwart the grand jury's ability to reach a fair conclusion,\" he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"HOME CLINIC;\nSpecific Tools for Specific Tasks Are a Major Step for Safety","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/nyregion/home-clinic-specific-tools-for-specific-tasks-are-a-major-step-for.html","abstract":"HAND-held tools are not necessarily easy to use.

That series, \"American Maniacs,\" has helped make Mickey and Mallory pop-star murderers. Now Mickey turns on the reporter and speaks the truest lines in Oliver Stone's film.  He says: \"Killing you and what you represent is a statement. I'm not exactly 100 percent sure of what it's saying.\" But it's a statement, all right.    It wouldn't be fair to reveal whether Mickey pulls the trigger on Wayne, but his confusion about what the trash-TV reporter represents is a perfect reflection of the film's own problems. \"Natural Born Killers\" seems to say something about the insidious influence of the media -- tabloids and celebrity journalism in print as well as on television. Yet under its entertaining flash-and-dazzle surface, the film's statement is \"TV can be a bad influence.\" No kidding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Lisa Goodrich, Eamon O'Neill","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/style/weddings-lisa-goodrich-eamon-o-neill.html","abstract":"  Lisa Vaughn Goodrich, a daughter of Robert and Nancy Goodrich of Concord, Mass., was married there yesterday to Eamon Gearoid O'Neill, a son of Liam and Therese O'Neill of Killiney, County Dublin, Ireland.

Once a 20-foot-deep, eight-acre expanse of water, Mirror Lake is naturally turning into a marsh. Now it is a lake only in spring, when a foot of water from melted snow covers several acres.   The $200,000 restoration was developed by national park officials and the nonprofit Yosemite Fund. The Chevron Corporation contributed the funds and arranged for 500 of its employees to participate in the restoration of the lake and the surrounding 100 acres. The first stage will begin this fall with the gathering of seeds and cuttings for propagation, and the rebuilding of a loop trail round the lake.    During the project, the area will not be closed but the trail system will be redirected to minimize foot traffic in some areas. One of the main goals of the project, said Frank Dean, assistant to the park superintendent, \"is to remove a spider web of trails that crisscrosses the lake bed.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Catherine Devine, George Moore Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/style/weddings-catherine-devine-george-moore-jr.html","abstract":"  Catherine Marie Devine, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth P.

Neighborhood legend has it that one Black Disciples leader beat his own brother to the ground for violating the rules.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Where Tokyo's Young Crowd Likes to Eat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/travel/choice-tables-where-tokyo-s-young-crowd-likes-to-eat.html","abstract":"  TWENTY is the age of majority throughout Japan; the age at which it's legal to drink, and to vote. Twenty-something in Japan means eclectic eating: Members of Japan's newest generation of business people and bureaucrats are as likely to gobble down a burger as they are to savor sushi. Most grab quick but filling lunches at midday, then join their co-workers and classmates for leisurely, though casual, eating and drinking in the evening. The more ambitious among the young professionals often return to the office after dinner, or accompany their superiors entertainingclients at fancy restaurants. Of course, dining at elegant, fashionable spots is very much a part of the dating scene.    As in industralized societies throughout the world, in Japan the daily diet of young professionals includes ample quantities of fast food. No doubt McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Denny's have changed the face of casual eating in Japan forever. But in the past year or so, a gentrified version of traditional Japanese street fare, called yatai mura (literally, \"village of street stalls\"), has also sprung up in Tokyo, and it is particularly popular with young people.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Autumn Leaves From Another Perspective: New Hampshire;\nHikers Get Best Look At a Very Wide Choice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/travel/autumn-leaves-from-another-perspective-new-hampshire-hikers-get-best.html","abstract":"James Joyce once quipped, \"Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.\" A similar challenge would involve touring New Hampshire without glimpsing the woods.

The terrain around Matera is tufa, a calcareous composite that provided its inhabitants, as far back as the Neolithic Age, with grotto dwellings and easily excavated caves. Today, 8,000 years later, honeycombs of houses are carved into the rock in an arabesque of crudely shaped shelters and elegant homes.\n\nThe town of 55,000 is the second largest in Basilicata, a region of Italy that is sparsely populated, and where more than 90 percent of the terrain is hills or mountains. At 1,300 feet, Matera rises from a ravine, and its cave homes, or \"sassi,\" swarm up two slopes. The houses -- set off by tiny piazzas, courtyards and cantinas -- are layered one on top of another, tangled along the face of the bluff in an intricate web. Houses fold into each other, as the roof of one becomes another's floor or neighborhood sidewalk. Facades have been added to the fronts of the cave homes, providing the illusion of traditional architecture.  Although plumbing and electricity are modern additions, for hundreds of years Materans used a system of cisterns carved into the rock to collect rainwater. At night it is easy to see which of the ancient structures are currently occupied. Seen from Piazza San Pietro, on the edge of the sassi, lights shine through doorways and windows, filling the tenebrous streets with an eerie glow.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"The Granddaddy Of Disorder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/arts/art-the-granddaddy-of-disorder.html","abstract":"  THE SUMMER HAS BEEN STIFLING, too hot, Cy Twombly said, for painting, too full of distraction and diversion.

The preparations were for Mr. Twombly's largest American retrospective ever, opening next Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. It will include 50 paintings, 37 works on paper and 10 sculptures, embracing his entire career, from 1946 to a few weeks ago. Twombly's is not a household name in the United States, although he gained a certain notoriety when one of his works was singled out by Morley Safer during an attack on modern art on \"60 Minutes\" last year as a \"canvas of scrawls done with the wrong end of a paintbrush.\" On the other hand, those deceptively childlike scrawls have earned him many devoted followers among artists, critics and collectors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/sports/results-plus-278963.html","abstract":"  TENNIS  Ivanisevic Reaches Final in Romania  Top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic defeated Renzo Furlan, 6-4, 6-4, yesterday to move into the final of the Romanian Open, a clay-court tournament in Bucharest.

Frank Corsaro, who directed the production when it was new, in 1987, retained set designs by Donald Oenslager that had already survived two productions, one dating back to 1966.   Unlike the \"Tosca\" next door, Franco Zeffirelli's extravaganza at the Metropolitan Opera, with its slick grandeur, technological wizardry and hyperrealistic detail, Mr. Corsaro's intimate conception, with stage direction by Cynthia Edwards, stresses dark, gritty \"realism\" in its characterization. It goes over the top at times, as in its suddenly bloodthirsty portrayal of the temperamental yet good-hearted prima donna Floria Tosca, who is driven to desperation and vengeful homicide by the depraved lust and cruelty of the Roman police chief Baron Scarpia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Note to Readers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/opinion/note-to-readers.html","abstract":"  The Op-Ed page welcomes unsolicited manuscripts.

In a string of hits since 1985, and in her concerts, Ms. Houston's power and agility have always been exhilarating, although they didn't always connect with the shape of the songs. But at Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, opening a seven-night engagement through Sept. 27, she harnessed her vocals to her material for a concert that was not just flamboyant but often moving.   Ms. Houston sang two sets of love songs. In the first, she was backed by her band and flanked by four athletic dancers; in the second, she was a diva backed by a small orchestra. The two sets represented both sides of a successful career strategy that has kept her frisky enough for young pop fans yet respectable enough for their parents.   The first half was a tour de force. Ms. Houston had routines to run through: dance steps, a disco segment, and a denunciation of tabloid rumours about marital trouble (which followed two ardent kisses from her husband, the singer Bobby Brown). But she could easily wing it; when her daughter toddled on stage, she sang \"Old MacDonald\" to her, with the sultriest \"e-i-e-i-o\" imaginable. Ms. Houston tore into her hits with a playful virtuosity.   In uptempo songs, her three female backup singers took care of the straightforward choruses while Ms. Houston volleyed responses. She tossed around syncopations, percussive or soaring, using every repeated lyric as a springboard for a new improvisation. In a medley of ballads, she caressed and savored every line. She sounded tenderly tremulous as she asked, \"Where do broken hearts go?,\" affectionate and satisfied as she declared, \"Nobody loves me like you do.\" \"Love,\" a word that reappears countless times in her songs, could be an airy note, a voluptuous glide, a joyful cascade. Where she once lavished ornaments at random, she now puts across sentiment as well as showiness.   For the second half, Ms. Houston belted ballads, predictably bringing down the house with songs that moved from aching verses to surging choruses. A medley of hits from Dionne Warwicke, Ms. Houston's cousin, lacked Ms. Warwicke's lightness, but Ms. Houston made \"Alfie\" sound like the ethical wrangle it is. Ms. Houston dedicated \"I Will Always Love You\" to her father, who she said had gone to the hospital that afternoon. Her tearful voice -- it even broke on one note -- gave the song more immediacy than the stentorian recorded version.   The concert's catalyst was gospel, the music Ms. Houston grew up on. Between ballads she broke into a gospel song, moving across the stage like a singer getting the spirit. Her call-and-response arrangements, and some of her best improvised moments, also came directly from sanctified singing. \"Sometimes the church comes out and I can't help myself,\" Ms. Houston said at one point. Gospel links musical display to getting a message across, so Ms. Houston shouldn't hold back: the more she lets loose her gospel heritage, the better she sounds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Amid the Heat and the Interceptions, Jets Fall Back to Earth With a Thud","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/sports/pro-football-amid-heat-interceptions-jets-fall-back-earth-with-thud.html","abstract":"  So they're not perfect.

Raoul Cedras to give up his tyrant's grip on Haiti shows what a difference decisive commitment can make in American foreign policy. When at long last President Clinton made clear that he meant business, and former President Carter's mission underlined that determination, the game was over for the Haitian military.   \"This agreement came,\" President Clinton said in announcing the news, \"only because of the credible and imminent threat of the international force\" that was about to invade Haiti.   The denouement is a critical victory for a politically battered Bill Clinton. He came to the point of ordering an invasion of Haiti with evident reluctance, without asking Congress and against what polls said the public wanted. It was a very large gamble and it worked.    The fact that Gen. Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn were part of the Carter mission that Mr. Clinton sent to Haiti makes the result even happier for him politically. General Powell wears no party's label but has been eyed by Republicans as a potential candidate. Senator Nunn is the most important Southern Democrat in Congress.    As the American and other forces go in, Haiti still remains a potential policy minefield. But at least we are past the long, dismal example of classic failure in foreign policy: the failure to decide.    General Cedras and his colleagues overthrew Haiti's elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30, 1991. That posed a choice for American policy. We could work vigorously to undo the coup and restore Haiti's legitimate Government, or we could decide that what happened in Haiti did not engage the deepest U.S. interests.   President Bush sounded as if he had chosen the former course. He called the coup a threat to American security and said it would not stand. He demanded \"an immediate halt to violence and the restoration of democracy.\" But during the remaining 15 months of his Presidency Mr. Bush made no real effort to oust the Haitian military regime.   President Clinton, after he took office, shifted to a policy of negotiating with General Cedras for a settlement that would bring President Aristide back but give the military guarantees of safety. Negotiations took place on Governors Island in New York, and agreement was reached there on July 3, 1993. The plan called for President Aristide to return to Haiti on Oct. 30.   In the months between the Governors Island agreement and the scheduled date of President Aristide's return, there were many signals that General Cedras had no intention of doing what he had promised. The so-called \"attaches,\" killers directed by the military, murdered numbers of civilians in Port-au-Prince and assassinated a leading Aristide supporter.   But the Clinton Administration proceeded as if it believed Governors Island would be carried out. In October the Defense Department sent a U.S. ship, the Harlan County, to Haiti with 175 American and 25 Canadian soldiers who were supposed to train Haitian security forces for President Aristide's return.   On Oct. 11, 1993, as the Harlan County arrived in the harbor, armed goons and uniformed policemen demonstrated on the docks, beating civilians and shouting against the United States. The Clinton Administration ordered the Harlan County to leave.   That, surely, was the moment for decision. President Clinton could have ordered an immediate strike. A small invasion force, entirely adequate to round up the military leaders and their thugs, could have been quickly assembled. Congress and the public would have supported that response to the deliberate insulting of the United States. But Mr. Clinton did not act.   Nearly another year passed, with Americans unpersuaded that President Clinton had the determination or the power to act. Then he made the decision to invade, and the drama quickly changed.   This is President Clinton's moment, without wanting to quibble at that one may express the hope that from this episode will arise a new decisiveness in American foreign policy. The next best place to apply it is Bosnia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Cairo Policy On Economy Raises Fears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/world/cairo-policy-on-economy-raises-fears.html","abstract":"  Defying demands by the International Monetary Fund to devalue its currency and institute stiff economic changes, the Egyptian Government is pursuing policies that many economists and Western diplomats say could lead to severe economic upheaval and social unrest.

But the songs and dances they presented at Eisner and Lubin Auditorium at New York University have had to survive some storms of history.   The Namgyal Monastery, a center of Tantric Buddhism, was founded in 1574 and is the personal monastery of the Dalai Lama. The Chinese Communists outlawed Buddhism after they took over Tibet in 1949. A decade later, the Dalai Lama fled into exile and the monks followed him. In 1961, they established a new Namgyal Monastery in Dharamsala in northern India. This program by a troupe of eight monks was a benefit for both the monastery and the Namgyal Fund, a refugee aid organization.   09-19-94 The music was notable for its unusual sonorities. Low roarings and rumblings produced by enormously long horns were contrasted with the high-pitched nasal piercing sounds of oboelike instruments. There were also trumpets, cymbals, bells and drums.   The dances emphasized constant repetitions of a few basic steps, especially slow, careful raisings of the feet. These works are not meant to dazzle or even entertain spectators, although they were always fascinating to watch. Rather, they are religious rituals in which movement becomes a form of meditation and the performers can visualize themselves as deities as they dance.   Because the same steps occur so often, any dramatic hints of menace soon vanish. The monks were costumed as skeletons and hopped grotesquely in the \"Dance of the Cemetery Lords.\" But they never looked frightening, in part because what they did became so familiar through repetition that it no longer had the power to startle. Death was thereby choreographically transfigured.   \"Black Hat Dance\" was also filled with hopping. Yet this symbolic depiction of the overcoming of obstacles did not grow agitated. Instead, it expressed faith in the ultimate power of goodness.   In \"Deer Dance,\" the evening's most charming piece, a masked and antlered soloist did quick little bouncing steps. But the solo was intended to do more than charm, for the deer was an image of a protective deity. The Namgyal Monks made strong dancing a sign of spiritual strength.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Doctor Shows for the High-Tech 90's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/arts/television-review-doctor-shows-for-the-high-tech-90-s.html","abstract":"  Like westerns, cop shows and sitcoms, the combination of doctors and hospitals is a television staple.

That it was hit by Fred Couples, one of America's favorite golfers, can only hasten its historic implications.

That's at least partly because on Friday night from 7,000 to 10,000 of them, depending on which official of the Jacob Javits Center one spoke to, spent six hours dancing at the center at an immense party celebrating Mexican Independence Day. The show featured a handful of bands from Central America, all warmups for two of the biggest Spanish-language bands from Mexico and the United States, Los Tigres del Norte, originally from the state of Sinaloa, and Selena, from Corpus Christi, Tex.   The idea was elegance, and every band and all the audience members had their own ideas on how to achieve it. Grupo Lora, from El Salvador, wore black uniforms flashing with gold epaulets and spangles. Selena looked like a New York club kid, filtered through Texas, with cowboy boots and a studded belt and a bared belly button. And Los Tigres del Norte had matching white suits with details featuring the colors of the Mexican flag, and cowboy boots. The audience, dressed for Saturday night, wore everything from ponchos to cowboy outfits with hats, to the slick style found in provincial capitals across Mexico. The party was a huge outburst of regional pride, a declaration that even in the North, the past wasn't going to be left behind, and that the finery of life was what counted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"1944:MacArthur Named : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/opinion/IHT-1944macarthur-named-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"CHICAGO - [From our New York edition:] The American Legion and the nation received today [Sept. 18] from Admiral Chester W.
