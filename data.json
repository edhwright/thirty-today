Otherwise, why would all of us bother to clamber into those ghastly flying machines and head off to parts unknown for mishaps unimagined? More likely, this recurrent yearning to return to a state of viewing virginity is peculiar to a place whose only raison d'etre is making an astonishing first impression. Would that I could see Venice today as I did riding with my family in a private motorized rowboat manned by a captain in a candy-striped shirt, when I was a freckled, crew-cut 10-year-old who couldn't imagine how a city had waterways for byways.

And the news is clearly bad for the state's 65,000 employees; about 3,000 of them will be cut from the payroll over 18 months through layoffs, privatization and attrition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950122","headline":"From Cheese to Apples, With Great Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/22/nyregion/dining-out-from-cheese-to-apples-with-great-style.html","abstract":"  ANY doubts about Greenwich as a premier restaurant town can be dispelled quickly by a visit to 64 Greenwich Ave., and the new restaurant of that name that has superseded Lotus East.

At the entry, chairs and a couch face each other over a coffee table, where bar patrons can nibble crackers and cheese before dinner. There are three dining rooms: one with a wood-burning fireplace, one with lace curtains and one up a spiral staircase in an L-shape room with bright red sponged walls and white trim. Small banquettes provide a sense of intimacy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950122","headline":"For the Mane, Of Course","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/22/style/thing-for-the-mane-of-course.html","abstract":"  TRIGGER, WHO DOES YOUR HAIR? For a silkier, thicker mane, men and women are lathering up with shampoo and conditioner designed for coarse equine hair. The leading brand, Mane 'n Tail, once available only in horse specialty and feed shops, now sells 95 percent of its product to tail-deprived humans. Four factories work double shifts to fill orders, and annual sales reached $60 million last year (up from $500,000 in 1989). A PHENOMENON IS SIRED: Barely four years ago, Roger Dunavant, the president of Straight Arrow in Bethlehem, Pa., the maker of Mane 'n Tail, handed out samples to horse folk; they told him what a nice job the concoction did on their hair. Soon after, a market study found that 10 of 12 buyers were not using it on their ponies. A LEGAL HORSE RACE: To protect its good mane, Mr. Dunavant has sued 12 companies and accused them of misappropriating the Mane 'n Tail moniker. Dick Kaitz, the executive vice president of Palm Beach Products, makers of Lucky Kentucky Mane, Tail and Body Shampoo, said the charges were baseless: \"They were turned down for a trademark for Mane 'n Tail. We had a legal opinion that gave us the go-ahead.\" A BUCKET JOB: Instructions from the Mane 'n Tail bottle: \"Add 1 oz. per gallon of warm water into a bucket. Pre-wet the coat with just water to remove excessive, loose dirt. Apply shampoo solution with a sponge or massage until a rich lather appears.\" Directions on two new packaged-for-humans lines, Equenne and Conceived by Nature, indicate a little dab of the viscous shampoo will do ya, and forget the bucket. IT ISN'T PRELL, BUT . . .: John Fish, Kmart's hair-care buyer, said customers had requested Mane 'n Tail before he stocked the shelves of the chain's 2,350 stores with it. \"We tested it in our quality assurance department and the information was that it was safe for humans,\" he said. \"It doesn't sell like Pantene Pro-V or Suave, but it sells very well.\" A local price comparison found a 32-ounce bottle of Mane 'n Tail selling for $5.99, or about 19 cents an ounce; a 13-ounce bottle of Pantene for $3.19, or 25 cents an ounce, and a 15-ounce bottle of Suave, 99 cents, or 6 cents an ounce. CELEBRITY NEIGH-SAYER: On the \"Late Show With David Letterman,\" Terry Bradshaw, Fox's football commentator, confided that the equine rinse had grown hair atop his bare dome, a renaissance thus far undetectable to the TV-watching eye. Mr. Dunavant said he couldn't make such a claim, \"or the F.D.A. will force me to do a $50 million study.\" But he added, \"I haven't lost any hair since I started using it.\" I'VE GOT THE MOUSSE . . .: Now there are Mane 'n Tail hair spray, perm enhancer, mousse and detangler (all for humans only), as well as The Hoofmaker, a skin moisturizer that doubles as a fingernail strengthener. What's next, Secretariat lip gloss?

The ornate palace was built in the early 18th century by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, as a residence for his mistress, Anna Constantia von Cosel. The court architect Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann, who also built the famous Dresden Zwinger complex, completed the building in 1711. It later became one of the residences of the Saxon royal family.   The hotel is in the heart of Dresden, surrounded by landmarks such as the Residenz Castle, the Church of the Cross, the Zwinger museums and art galleries, as well as the Semper Opera House. It has 213 guest rooms, including 25 suites, in a modern style with clean lines, contrasting with the building's elaborate, classical exterior.   Until March 31 the hotel is offering an introductory rate of $155 a night for both single and double rooms.   After the official grand opening on March 31, rates will range from $220 to $270 for a single, and from $250 to $300 for a double room.    More information: Am Taschenberg, 01067 Dresden, Germany.

The same goes for the show's curators, Gary Golio, who succeeded Marilyn Grossman as director of the gallery last summer, and his longtime friend, Mary Udell, whose Sound Shore Gallery flourished for six years in Port Chester, before relocating (six years ago) to its present site in Stamford. Given the space presided over by Mr. Golio and the sculptors in Mrs. Udell's stable, the collaboration was inevitable. Chappaqua Library is a grand spread with walls inside and out made of blond concrete that has a ridged surface reminiscent of wide-wale corduroy. While the roughly 14-year-old structure is the last word in the International Style, the grounds have a medieval touch in the stream that flows around the edge like a moat. Visitors walk through the library to find the gallery at the rear -- a long room with windows and doors giving on to the garden and its sculpture display, of which more anon.    In the gallery is a show of paintings by Belle Manes and small bronzes by Isabel Shaw, which was selected by Mr. Golio's predecessor. Ms. Manes has exhibited her still lives and interiors with figures in the galleries and museums of Connecticut and Westchester for more than a decade, during which time her compositions seem to have grown denser and her colors stronger. Where some might regard drawing and painting as separate activities, this artist does the two simultaneously, building up masses even as she defines and redefines their contours. It is a technique born of Cubism, which in Ms. Manes's case, yields recognizable shapes notwithstanding numerous pentimenti.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950122","headline":"The Homeless Share Campsites and Consolation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/22/world/quake-in-japan-the-shelters-the-homeless-share-campsites-and-consolation.html","abstract":"  After darkness fell on the schoolyard, a dozen survivors warmed their fingers over a bonfire fed by pieces of collapsed houses.

From the public hall called in Arabic qaisariya (\"Caesar's room,\" suggesting a connection between the oldest bazaars and ancient Roman basilicas) to mosque and seminary and bathhouse, from quiet terraced religious clubhouse to teeming caravansary -- here is the bazaar, made even more appealing by the realization that the global spread of the modern industrial economy has probably doomed this beautiful house of life.

Instead, the city has succeeded in demonstrating that such a system is inherently vulnerable to the stealing of entire elections by insiders at private companies or the Board of Elections itself.\n\nThis morning, the 10-member board is to hold a public hearing at which witnesses will give sworn testimony about the security of the proposed system -- 7,000 all-electronic voting machines, to be built by Sequoia Pacific Voting Equipment Inc. of Jamestown, N.Y., and a central programming system to be developed by Deloitte & Touche, the big national accounting firm. The board has three choices: to go ahead with the purchase, delay it on grounds of security (for a third time) or abandon it.

In all three cases, fascination with the clarinet's dark, complex and ambiguous tone was associated with particular people. Mozart wrote for Anton Stadler, Weber for Heinrich Baermann.

This blunt, blaring, truly executed performance scrubbed away such pesky accretions as irony, paradox and double-entendre. The first movement's booming brass enunciations and the Andante Amoroso's quiet grace had value if taken on their own terms, but enthusiasm and good manners take this music only so far and so deep.   The Minnesota is an international orchestra of real accomplishment; it has the flexibility to do what it is asked. So one can only assume that this was the kind of playing Mr. de Waart had in mind. The Seventh, like all the Mahler symphonies, is music written by a conductor for a conductor. Thursday's man in charge demonstrated decisively his can-do attitude.

She looms over an onstage audience of cheering gay men. In their midst is Harvey Milk, San Francisco's first openly homosexual elected official, who loved opera and even attended a performance the night before he was assassinated in 1978.   So how does he fare on the other side of the proscenium, as the subject of a much-discussed, already debated work that will be shown here through Feb. 5, at the New York City Opera in the spring and in San Francisco next season? To the opera's credit, the answer is not simple. With music by Stewart Wallace and libretto by Michael Korie, the work is a rambunctious combination of banality and effective drama, posturing, playfulness and polemics. Long stretches of the score, which is written with a mixture of free atonality, 1980's eclecticism and ersatz pop, are lyrically awkward and unconvincing, but much of the last act is pungent and focused. The cast was generally excellent (with one relatively unknown singer, Gidon Saks, making a strong impression), the conducting by Ward Holmquist fervent, and the production by Christopher Alden imaginative, but it was impossible to separate onstage events from offstage history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950123","headline":"West Hartford Tries to Cope As Its Schools Are Integrated","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/23/nyregion/west-hartford-tries-to-cope-as-its-schools-are-integrated.html","abstract":"  As minority families leave Hartford's poor neighborhoods and immigrants from Southeast Asia join booming enclaves here, this community, a symbol for generations of the suburban good life in Connecticut, has run afoul of the state's racial-balance law.

Scientists have now discovered yet another reason sex can kill, at least in the case of a favorite laboratory creature, the fruit fly. They have determined that a compound in the male's semen is toxic to the female, and that over the long run (which, by fly standards, means a few weeks), the ingredient significantly shortens her life.

One of those trap doors is the deferral of major weapons purchases until 1998, which is designed to make current and near-term spending levels seem more reasonable and to hide the ultimate costs of new weapons already under development or soon to start.

Oddly enough, in the case of former President Jimmy Carter, the very qualities that helped cripple him as a politician are also the qualities that make him a mediocre poet.   As President, Mr. Carter was frequently criticized for lacking a real vision; he was widely described as a technician, an engineer, an ineffectual manager lacking imagination, passion and focus. As one associate put it, he \"knew all the words and none of the music.\" The same might well be said of the poems in \"Always a Reckoning\": well-meaning, dutifully wrought poems that plod earnestly from point A to point B without ever making a leap into emotional hyperspace, poems that lack not only a distinctive authorial voice, but also anything resembling a psychological or historical subtext.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950124","headline":"Assembly Backs a Revision of Law on Toxic Chemicals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/24/nyregion/assembly-backs-a-revision-of-law-on-toxic-chemicals.html","abstract":"  The Assembly today voted to revise a 1991 law aimed at reducing the use of toxic substances in manufacturing, responding to the plea of businesses, who said they were being strangled by red tape.
