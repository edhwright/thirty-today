Having spoken with literally thousands of parents, children and teachers, we were appalled at the public's wealth of environmental misunderstanding.\n\nWe were equally chagrined by the superficiality of what we heard, and have coined a new term for this type of sound-bite-based, factoid-heavy understanding: eco-glibberish. Here are half a dozen examples:\nRecycling Is the Key\n\n Myth: The most important thing we can do is to recycle. Actually, it's one of the least important things we can do, if our real objective is to conserve resources. Remember the phrase \"reduce, reuse and recycle\"? Reduce comes first for a good reason: it's better to not create waste than to have to figure out what to do with it. And recycling, like any other form of manufacturing, uses energy and other resources while creating pollution and greenhouse gases.\n\nRather, we need to make products more durable, lighter, more energy efficient and easier to repair rather than to replace. Finally, we need to reduce and reuse packaging.\nGarbage Will Overwhelm Us\n\n Myth: There's a garbage crisis. The original garbage crisis occurred when people first settled down to farm and could no longer leave their campsites after their garbage grew too deep. \n\nSince then, every society has had to figure out what to do with discards. That something was usually unhealthy, odiferous and ugly -- throwing garbage in the streets, piling it up just outside of town, incorporating it into structures or simply setting it on fire.\n\nToday we can design history's and the world's safest recycling facilities, landfills and incinerators. We even have a national glut of landfill capacity, thanks to the fact that we've been building large regional landfills to replace older, smaller local dumps.\n\nThe problem is political. No one wants to spend money on just getting rid of garbage or to have a garbage site in the backyard. \n\nThe obvious solution is to stop generating so much garbage in the first place. Doing so requires both the knowledge and self-discipline to conserve energy and to do more with less stuff.\nIndustry Is To Blame\n\n Myth: It's all industry's fault. No, it's all people's fault. Certainly industry has played a significant role in destroying habitats, generating pollution and depleting resources. But we're the ones who signal businesses that what they're doing is acceptable -- every time we open our wallets.\n\nAnd don't just blame industrial societies. In his recent book \"Earth Politics,\" Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker wrote that \"perhaps 90 percent of the extinction of species, soil erosion, forest and wilderness destruction and also desertification are taking place in developing countries.\" Thus, even non-industrialized, subsistence economies are creating environmental havoc.\nThe Earth Is in Peril\n\n Myth: We have to save the earth. Frankly, the earth doesn't need to be saved. \n\nNature doesn't give a hoot if human beings are here or not. The planet has survived cataclysmic and catastrophic changes for millions upon millions of years. Over that time, it is widely believed, 99 percent of all species have come and gone while the planet has remained.\n\nSaving the environment is really about saving our environment -- making it safe for ourselves, our children and the world as we know it. If more people saw the issue as one of saving themselves, we would probably see increased motivation and commitment to actually doing so.\nPackaging Is the Problem\n\n Myth: Packaging accounts for a growing percentage of our solid waste. If you were to examine a dumpster of garbage from the 1950's and a dumpster of garbage from the 1980's, you would find more discarded packaging in the first one. Packaging has actually decreased as a proportion of all solid wastes -- from more than half in the 1950's to just over one-third today.\n\nOne reason is that there was more of other kinds of wastes -- old appliances, magazines, office paper -- in the 1980's. But the main causes were two changes in the packaging industry.\n\nFirst, the heavy metal cans and glass bottles of the 1950's gave way to far lighter and more crushable containers -- about 22 percent lighter by the 1980's. At the same time, many metal and glass containers were replaced by paper boxes and plastic bottles and bins, which are even lighter and more crushable.\n\nSecond, the carrying capacity of packages -- the quantity of product that can be delivered per ounce of packaging material -- increased hugely. \n\nGlass, for example, has a carrying capacity of 1.2, meaning that 1.2 fluid ounces of milk or juice are delivered for every ounce of glass in which they are contained. Plastic containers have a carrying capacity of about 30.\nAmericans Are Wasting More\n\n Myth: Americans are over-consumers, since the per capita creation of solid waste continues to climb.  Each person generates about 4.4 pounds of garbage a day -- a number that has been growing steadily. The implication is that we partake in an unstoppable orgy of consumption. The truth is far more mundane.\n\nIn reality, increases in solid waste are based largely on the mathematics of households, not individuals. That's because regardless of the size of a household, fixed activities and purchases generate trash.\n\nAs new households form, they create additional garbage. Think about a couple going through a divorce. Once there was one home. Now there are two. Building that second house or condo used lots of resources and created lots of construction debris. Where once there was one set of furniture, one washing machine and one refrigerator, now there are two. Each refrigerator contains milk cartons, meat wrappers and packages of mixed vegetables. Each pantry contains cereal boxes and canned goods.\n\nTo make matters worse, households are growing at a fairly rapid rate, almost double the rate of population growth. That's because we're all living longer and away from our children, divorcing more frequently and becoming far more accepting of single-parent households.\n\nCensus Bureau numbers tell this story: From 1972 to 1987, the population grew by 16 percent. The number of households grew by 35 percent. Municipal solid waste increased by 35 percent, too. \n\nIf Americans were really creating more trash by overindulging, we would be spending more on trash-generating items: nondurable goods like food and cosmetics. These all generate lots of garbage, since they are used and discarded quickly, along with their packaging. But household expenditures for nondurable goods, as measured by constant dollars, declined slightly from 1972 to 1987 -- by about one-half of 1 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\nDoes all of this mean we can sit back and relax? No. The earth's resources are finite. Habitats are being destroyed. Biodiversity is declining. And the consumption of resources is expanding.\n\nBut it does mean that we must be less willing to accept glib, ideological pronouncements of right and wrong, good and evil, cause and effect. Thus, to truly change the world for the better, we need more facts, not simply more faith.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950121","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/nyregion/bridge-327795.html","abstract":"  Sixty years ago there was a young actress in New York City named Ann Gallagher.

For a silkier, thicker mane, men and women are lathering up with shampoo and conditioner designed for coarse equine hair. The leading brand, Mane 'n Tail, once available only in horse specialty and feed shops, now sells 95 percent of its product to tail-deprived humans. Four factories work double shifts to fill orders, and annual sales reached $60 million last year (up from $500,000 in 1989). A PHENOMENON IS SIRED: Barely four years ago, Roger Dunavant, the president of Straight Arrow in Bethlehem, Pa., the maker of Mane 'n Tail, handed out samples to horse folk; they told him what a nice job the concoction did on their hair. Soon after, a market study found that 10 of 12 buyers were not using it on their ponies. A LEGAL HORSE RACE: To protect its good mane, Mr. Dunavant has sued 12 companies and accused them of misappropriating the Mane 'n Tail moniker. Dick Kaitz, the executive vice president of Palm Beach Products, makers of Lucky Kentucky Mane, Tail and Body Shampoo, said the charges were baseless: \"They were turned down for a trademark for Mane 'n Tail. We had a legal opinion that gave us the go-ahead.\" A BUCKET JOB: Instructions from the Mane 'n Tail bottle: \"Add 1 oz. per gallon of warm water into a bucket. Pre-wet the coat with just water to remove excessive, loose dirt. Apply shampoo solution with a sponge or massage until a rich lather appears.\" Directions on two new packaged-for-humans lines, Equenne and Conceived by Nature, indicate a little dab of the viscous shampoo will do ya, and forget the bucket. IT ISN'T PRELL, BUT . . .: John Fish, Kmart's hair-care buyer, said customers had requested Mane 'n Tail before he stocked the shelves of the chain's 2,350 stores with it. \"We tested it in our quality assurance department and the information was that it was safe for humans,\" he said. \"It doesn't sell like Pantene Pro-V or Suave, but it sells very well.\" A local price comparison found a 32-ounce bottle of Mane 'n Tail selling for $5.99, or about 19 cents an ounce; a 13-ounce bottle of Pantene for $3.19, or 25 cents an ounce, and a 15-ounce bottle of Suave, 99 cents, or 6 cents an ounce. CELEBRITY NEIGH-SAYER: On the \"Late Show With David Letterman,\" Terry Bradshaw, Fox's football commentator, confided that the equine rinse had grown hair atop his bare dome, a renaissance thus far undetectable to the TV-watching eye. Mr. Dunavant said he couldn't make such a claim, \"or the F.D.A. will force me to do a $50 million study.\" But he added, \"I haven't lost any hair since I started using it.\" I'VE GOT THE MOUSSE . . .: Now there are Mane 'n Tail hair spray, perm enhancer, mousse and detangler (all for humans only), as well as The Hoofmaker, a skin moisturizer that doubles as a fingernail strengthener.

The court architect Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann, who also built the famous Dresden Zwinger complex, completed the building in 1711. It later became one of the residences of the Saxon royal family.   The hotel is in the heart of Dresden, surrounded by landmarks such as the Residenz Castle, the Church of the Cross, the Zwinger museums and art galleries, as well as the Semper Opera House. It has 213 guest rooms, including 25 suites, in a modern style with clean lines, contrasting with the building's elaborate, classical exterior.

The same goes for the show's curators, Gary Golio, who succeeded Marilyn Grossman as director of the gallery last summer, and his longtime friend, Mary Udell, whose Sound Shore Gallery flourished for six years in Port Chester, before relocating (six years ago) to its present site in Stamford. Given the space presided over by Mr. Golio and the sculptors in Mrs. Udell's stable, the collaboration was inevitable. Chappaqua Library is a grand spread with walls inside and out made of blond concrete that has a ridged surface reminiscent of wide-wale corduroy. While the roughly 14-year-old structure is the last word in the International Style, the grounds have a medieval touch in the stream that flows around the edge like a moat. Visitors walk through the library to find the gallery at the rear -- a long room with windows and doors giving on to the garden and its sculpture display, of which more anon.    In the gallery is a show of paintings by Belle Manes and small bronzes by Isabel Shaw, which was selected by Mr. Golio's predecessor. Ms. Manes has exhibited her still lives and interiors with figures in the galleries and museums of Connecticut and Westchester for more than a decade, during which time her compositions seem to have grown denser and her colors stronger. Where some might regard drawing and painting as separate activities, this artist does the two simultaneously, building up masses even as she defines and redefines their contours. It is a technique born of Cubism, which in Ms. Manes's case, yields recognizable shapes notwithstanding numerous pentimenti.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950122","headline":"The Homeless Share Campsites and Consolation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/22/world/quake-in-japan-the-shelters-the-homeless-share-campsites-and-consolation.html","abstract":"  After darkness fell on the schoolyard, a dozen survivors warmed their fingers over a bonfire fed by pieces of collapsed houses.

The enchantment turns to wonder inside; the domes rest on arches of latticed bricks arranged in forms so delicate they make the spirit sing. For many centuries bazaars have brought together in one immense place religion, political power and the economic life of cities from Morocco to Central Asia. In THE PERSIAN BAZAAR: Veiled Space of Desire (Mage, $50), Mehdi Khansari and Minouch Yavari, scholars of history and architecture (and husband and wife), reveal the social logic underlying these magnificent structures -- in drawings and words, but most vividly in photographs that let one discover the magic cave that is a bazaar as if one were walking through it, assaulted by the sounds of potters, cabinet makers, farriers and merchants of everything from bread to gold, seduced by the odor of spices and coffee, dazzled by light drifting down from the pierced domes and scattered by brilliantly glazed arches and ceilings onto crowds winding far below among fabrics and carpets, donkeys and carts, dust and incense. From the public hall called in Arabic qaisariya (\"Caesar's room,\" suggesting a connection between the oldest bazaars and ancient Roman basilicas) to mosque and seminary and bathhouse, from quiet terraced religious clubhouse to teeming caravansary -- here is the bazaar, made even more appealing by the realization that the global spread of the modern industrial economy has probably doomed this beautiful house of life.

Instead, the city has succeeded in demonstrating that such a system is inherently vulnerable to the stealing of entire elections by insiders at private companies or the Board of Elections itself.\n\nThis morning, the 10-member board is to hold a public hearing at which witnesses will give sworn testimony about the security of the proposed system -- 7,000 all-electronic voting machines, to be built by Sequoia Pacific Voting Equipment Inc. of Jamestown, N.Y., and a central programming system to be developed by Deloitte & Touche, the big national accounting firm. The board has three choices: to go ahead with the purchase, delay it on grounds of security (for a third time) or abandon it.

No other wind instrument has attracted such a powerful repertory, or such serious performing talent.   In all three cases, fascination with the clarinet's dark, complex and ambiguous tone was associated with particular people. Mozart wrote for Anton Stadler, Weber for Heinrich Baermann. An aging Brahms met Richard Muhlfeld in 1890 and was enchanted. The result: the Clarinet Quintet, the two duo Sonatas (Op. 120) and the A-minor Trio that Paul Meyer, Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax played at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950123","headline":"Clinton Plans A New Vision Once Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/23/us/clinton-plans-a-new-vision-once-again.html","abstract":"  Bill Clinton has revived, reinvigorated or reinvented himself half a dozen times since he set out to win the White House, and in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, his advisers say, he aims to do so once again by sketching a vision of how he will cooperate -- and compete -- with the new Republican ascendancy.

This blunt, blaring, truly executed performance scrubbed away such pesky accretions as irony, paradox and double-entendre. The first movement's booming brass enunciations and the Andante Amoroso's quiet grace had value if taken on their own terms, but enthusiasm and good manners take this music only so far and so deep.   The Minnesota is an international orchestra of real accomplishment; it has the flexibility to do what it is asked. So one can only assume that this was the kind of playing Mr. de Waart had in mind. The Seventh, like all the Mahler symphonies, is music written by a conductor for a conductor. Thursday's man in charge demonstrated decisively his can-do attitude. Transitions from tempo to tempo were well thought out and seams between phrases neatly managed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950123","headline":"In Performance; POP","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/23/arts/in-performance-pop-125995.html","abstract":"  Oh, for Those Bouncy Old Days In Which Angst Was Repressed  Manhattan Rhythm Kings Rainbow and Stars    Pop nostalgia doesn't get more polished than in the performances of the Manhattan Rhythm Kings, the vocal trio that recently left the cast of the Broadway musical \"Crazy for You\" after 850 performances.

She looms over an onstage audience of cheering gay men. In their midst is Harvey Milk, San Francisco's first openly homosexual elected official, who loved opera and even attended a performance the night before he was assassinated in 1978.   So how does he fare on the other side of the proscenium, as the subject of a much-discussed, already debated work that will be shown here through Feb. 5, at the New York City Opera in the spring and in San Francisco next season? To the opera's credit, the answer is not simple. With music by Stewart Wallace and libretto by Michael Korie, the work is a rambunctious combination of banality and effective drama, posturing, playfulness and polemics. Long stretches of the score, which is written with a mixture of free atonality, 1980's eclecticism and ersatz pop, are lyrically awkward and unconvincing, but much of the last act is pungent and focused.
