Sometimes the nightmare is fatal, or very nearly so. During the last decade carriage horses have collapsed from heat exhaustion, stomach cramps and leg cramps, and several have bolted. One was forced into an intersection by a speeding limousine, broke a leg and had to be destroyed.   Without very strong regulation, this industry has little to recommend it. It provides jobs for only a handful of people, and can snarl traffic and sentence horses to years of hard labor among buses, cars, honking horns and noisome exhausts. That's why the City Council in 1989 wisely voted to put the horses out to pasture, so to speak, by passing Local Law 89, which restricts the times and areas in which the carriages may operate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931116","headline":"Woolridge Signs as Free Agent With 76ers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/16/sports/sports-people-basketball-woolridge-signs-as-free-agent-with-76ers.html","abstract":"  Forward ORLANDO WOOLRIDGE has joined the Philadelphia 76ers, having signed a free-agent contract.

As Dora (Frances McDormand), a part-time nurse who lives alone on the edge of a Nebraska highway imagines it, men are born on the planet Pluto, molecularly disassembled and sent directly to Earth by radar. Their troubles arise from having to adapt to an alien ecosystem. An inability to adapt was the reason, she believes, why one of her three former husbands shot himself to death the day after they were married.    A dark comedy of the supernatural tinged with Greek myth, \"The Swan,\" which opened yesterday at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an absorbing 100-minute riff on Dora's theory. Most of all, the play, which suggests a softer, surreal response to Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love,\" is notable for a tumultuously intense performance by the Swedish actor Peter Stormare.

Pedro quickly discovers that his job is not at all the equivalent of being a modern-day road warrior.

Staking his reputation on the outcome of tonight's vote in the House, he's done what a President is supposed to do when issues are tough and the public is evenly divided: Lead.    The question now is whether a Democratic Congress will vote its conscience or its fears. A no vote wouldn't bury the Clinton Presidency. But it would cast doubt on his and his party's ability to govern. It would also undermine Mr. Clinton's credibility abroad, just as the all-important Uruguay Round of international trade talks is drawing to a close. Beyond that, it could send a devastating signal about America's appetite for global leadership after the cold war. That is what the Nafta vote is ultimately about: whether the country is willing to move forward or retreat into economic isolation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931117","headline":"Court Rejects Pension Change","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/us/court-rejects-pension-change.html","abstract":"  In a ruling that creates fiscal problems for Albany and many local governments, New York's highest court rejected changes in the financing of the state's pension system.

Not infrequently, East Germans showed up with suitcases and nervous optimism and fell afoul of the People's Police.

Miss Christie is always partial to the upper classes and their stately homes. Their privileges are taken for granted. Outsiders, especially Americans, always tend to be suspect.
