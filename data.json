In both his program notes and his spoken comments, Mr. Norrington hastened to add that the concert was by no means a re-creation of one of these sprawling London performances but merely a glimpse of 18th-century practice. He deployed the violins antiphonally, and he split Symphony No. 99 in half, with a Cantata interposed between the Adagio and the Menuet.

But the borders that were forced down the throats of the Serbs after World War II were those separating Vojvodina and Kosovo from Serbia as autonomous provinces, and that separating Macedonia from Serbia as a republic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930327","headline":"Farrow Says Daughter Became Distraught Over Allen's Relentless Attention","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/27/nyregion/farrow-says-daughter-became-distraught-over-allen-s-relentless-attention.html","abstract":"  Mia Farrow testified yesterday that her 7-year-old daughter, Dylan, was so distraught over the relentless attention of her adoptive father, Woody Allen, that she frequently screamed, \"Hide me!

The President's waffling was rightly denounced by partisans on both sides of the controversy over whether gay men and women should be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces.   It's understandable that Mr. Clinton would seek some way to escape the furor caused by his pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals. But segregation -- by isolating gay soldiers in specified jobs or units or separate living quarters -- is both impractical and discriminatory. The presumed value of such segregation is that it would reduce tensions between heterosexuals and homosexuals -- and relieve heterosexuals of the fear they might be viewed as sexual targets by members of their own sex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930327","headline":"We Should Act in Bosnia for Humanity's Sake","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/27/opinion/l-we-should-act-in-bosnia-for-humanity-s-sake-719993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"There's No Oil in Bosnia\" (Op-Ed, March 10), Dimitri Simes admonishes the United States not to get involved in Bosnia because it is of no geopolitical importance to us.

His choice can only bolster Israeli moderates amid a discouraging impasse in Middle East peace talks.

The movie's advance scout had found the right expert in the 79-year-old winter angler. Over the decades, Mr. Schwartz's prowess on the ice with the sawed-off fishing pole known as the jiggle stick has earned him the nickname Mavin among bait-store owners and fishing-page editors across Minnesota.

And, even when they are indoors, they spend much of their time at their balconied windows, shouting conversations with neighbors or with passers-by in the street below. Apparently, Naples wears its heart on its sleeve; it appears to be a city without mysteries. But this hasty impression is totally misleading. In reality, Naples is a city of secrets. And now a program called Monumenti porte aperte -- Monuments: Open Doors -- is revealing many of them.\n\nThanks to a project sponsored by a number of local organizations and, chiefly, by the alert Fondazione Napoli '99, dozens of the city's monuments -- traditionally, notoriously neglected by the authorities and often ignored by the local inhabitants -- were opened free of charge one weekend last spring. And they were suddenly flooded with visitors, the Neapolitans themselves, who came out, in overwhelming numbers, to see beautiful and historic points in the city. The project's appealing name indicated that many of the city's treasures -- its unparallelled Baroque palaces, its great Gothic and Renaissance churches, its castles, museums, parks -- would be open to all and provided with volunteer, informed guides. The venture was chiefly aimed at schoolchildren, and some 5,000 had signed up for tours of the featured attractions, but, as it turned out, the grown-up Neapolitans wanted to see and enjoy their cultural wealth, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"CUOMO WANTS CAP ON DOCTORS' FEES, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/cuomo-wants-cap-on-doctors-fees-private-and-public.html","abstract":"  As part of a blueprint for major change in New York's health care system, Gov.

A week later, after a harrowing New Year's Eve (a friend was hit by a car and there was a shooting in her Milwaukee neighborhood), Ms. Benning found herself home alone and needing to talk. She turned to the camera, liking the fact that \"it didn't judge me -- it just sat there and recorded what I said.\" She started spending a lot of time in her room, not writing in a diary or musing before the mirror the way many adolescents do, but using the camera as a kind of diary-mirror.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Chaney Looks Just Horrible, He Feels Worse, but Loves It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/sports/ncaa-tournament-west-chaney-looks-just-horrible-he-feels-worse-but-loves-it.html","abstract":"  John Chaney's larynx is so overused, his voice is alternately hoarse and soprano.

Then I sprinkled about a quarter inch of potting soil over the seeds, patted it down, covered the pots with cellophane and set them on a table in a warm room (about 68 degrees by day and 60 by night).   I'll keep the soil moist by spritzing when necessary, and as soon as the seeds germinate, I'll stick them under fluorescent lights (kept as close as three inches from the baby leaves and turned off at night). As the plants grow, I'll raise the lights and fertilize with a diluted solution every few days.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Marc A.

The academy's architects have designed a modern athletic thoroughbred of a building. With a sleek, translucent facade of steel and glass, curving as it rounds the bend at East 153d Street just off the Grand Concourse, the design looks every inch a champion, and indeed it is one. Last December, the design won a competition for the most important new public building to go forward during the Dinkins administration.   A lot is riding on this project. With a budget of $230 million, the Police Academy is an important civic symbol, a sign that even in hard times, New York can build major public works. Now housed in crowded quarters on East 20th Street in Manhattan, the academy will be relocated to the South Bronx in an effort to erase the borough's image as a metaphor for urban decline. Not least, at a time when law and order promises to become a major issue in the approaching mayoral campaign, this project offers a conspicuous show of support for the city's law enforcement officers. It also offers an opportunity of overpowering importance: a chance to rethink the critical place of law enforcement in American cities today. This is what lifts the project out of the realm of local news and into a national spotlight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Dizzy's Daughter Has Her Own Career in Jazz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/dizzys-daughter-has-her-own-career-in-jazz.html","abstract":"JEANIE BRYSON was waiting to sing, listening to the piano in the lounge of the New Brunswick Hyatt Regency one recent evening, when the bass player leaned over and made a comment that tickled her.

Now we are finally back on our feet financially and would like to purchase a small home of our own. Can we get a mortgage? . . . Fernando Carrion, the Bronx. Answer: Yes, but it won't be easy. According to Beryl Riley, a mortgage manager with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, your best bet may be secondary lenders, such as Champion Mortgage, which may also charge you a higher rate. Mortgage brokers may also help you find a lender. Some banks, such as Chase Manhattan, will consider an application from someone with a bankruptcy on his credit report, but only if there is a full discharge of the bankruptcy and the borrower has established good or secured credit. Further, two years should have elapsed since the bankruptcy discharge, three years if there is a down payment of less than 20 percent. Also, it should be documented that extraordinary circumstances caused the bankruptcy, such as an extended illness that was not covered by health insurance, and that the event is not likely to occur again. Escrow Accounts Question: I recently refinanced my mortgage, a fixed rate on a private single-family residence. My bank, however, has refused to give me a current escrow analysis. Who regulates escrow accounts? Can I ask my bank for a complete escrow analysis more than once a year? . . . Randy Hunt, Locust Valley, L.I. Answer: No. According to Clare E. Sykes, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Banking, escrow issues are governed by the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which describes how escrow accounts are done, including how often escrow analyses can be requested. She added that analyses must be given annually, but no more often unless the lender desires. If the loan is refinanced by the same lender, the same rule applies. If a new lender refinances, then a new analysis is made. Security Deposit Question: My security deposit for my apartment is in a savings account under the name of the owner. I have a letter from her bank verifying that this account is separate from the owner's other accounts. But who is entitled to the accumulated interest? Also, the owner lives on the West Coast and travels extensively. How can I make sure that my deposit will be returned? Can I not pay my last month's rent? . . . K.A. Hanson, Manhattan Answer: Maybe. According to Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, when a landlord takes a security deposit it must be placed in a trust account and segregated from other money. Technically, he added, the account also has to be in the tenant's name.   He said that if the building had six or fewer units the owner did not have to pay interest. But if it has more than six units the tenant is entitled to the interest in the account, minus a 1 percent administration fee, which goes to the landlord. The interest can be accrued or paid annually; it's the landlord's choice. If the apartment is a New York rent-stabilized unit, the tenant can request that the interest be paid annually.   Mr. Finder said that, in New York, landlords had to return a security deposit within a reasonable amount of time; no exact number of days is prescribed. And though not paying your last month's rent is a violation of your lease, it has also become an almost customary practice. The landlord then keeps your security deposit and, if necessary, pursues a legal action to recover any damages. \"It is common to not pay the last month's rent to get a security deposit back,\" he said.   Technically, Mr. Finder added, a landlord could sue for nonpayment of a last month's rent and the tenant would be responsible for the landlord's legal fees. This rarely occurs, though. And as for any possibility of eviction during the last month, it couldn't be accomplished within 30 days, at least not in New York, he said.   Should you decide to pay your last month's rent, Mr. Finder recommended contacting your landlord before your lease expires and reminding them that you are expecting your deposit back. If you don't receive it within 30 pays, pursue legal action.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"The View From: Washington; Investors Head for the Hills With a New Commodity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/the-view-from-washington-investors-head-for-the-hills-with-a-new-commodity.html","abstract":"  REGARD the ostrich, one of nature's strangest creatures: Little head, long neck, fat middle.

Starting with a traditional seder dinner, a ritual feast that ushers in the holiday, the observance continues for eight days and involves consuming no foods that contain a leavening other than eggs.    Not only are eggs used in huge quantities to make feathery sponge cakes for the holiday dinners but they are also essential in preparing some other traditional dishes. The ground fish used for gefilte fish is held together with beaten egg and matzoh meal. Eggs are essential in making good chopped liver.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Kathryn Tyus and Johnathan Adair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/style/engagements-kathryn-tyus-and-johnathan-adair.html","abstract":"  Mary E.

To keep themselves from going mad, they make up various film scenarios and even joke about what might win an Academy Award. Much of the kidding is about Sir Richard Attenborough in general and his Oscar-winning \"Gandhi\" in particular. \"Gandhi,\" Mr. Rea's character observes, seems to go on for more time than he and his cellmates have spent in prison.   In this exchange, however indirectly, the new and old orders of Hollywood collide. Neither this Irish actor nor Mr. Attenborough can be thought of as a Hollywood insider, but anyone singled out for academy honors represents some aspect of the film-making establishment's taste. And that taste is changing dramatically. Six nominations for \"The Crying Game,\" the small and very idiosyncratic film in which Mr. Rea stars, indicate that the big, windy productions in which Mr. Attenborough specializes (this year's being \"Chaplin\") will no longer be acclaimed automatically as high cinematic art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"A World Gone Raving Mad","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/books/a-world-gone-raving-mad.html","abstract":"BALKAN GHOSTS\n\nA Journey Through History.\nBy Robert D.

How has a composer with a medieval name fashioned wildly popular music from the rites of Eastern Orthodox Christianity? American listeners will have a chance to find out when \"The Protecting Veil\" is performed in Boston on Wednesday and at Carnegie Hall on Friday evening, with the strings of the New England Conservatory Orchestra conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. Steven Isserlis, the winner of the conservatory's newly established Piatigor sky Artist Award for younger cellists, will play the solo part.   Mr. Tavener's career (not to be confused with that of the English Renaissance composer John Taverner) is a strange one. Now 49, he began as a populist experimenter, writing in a highly eclectic idiom that synthesized medieval elements with electronic timbres. His first major work, a dramatic cantata entitled \"The Whale,\" created a stir when it appeared in 1968; his opera \"Therese\" (1976) controversially intertwined the contemporaneous lives of the sainted nun Therese and the profane poet Rimbaud.

Those big ones to die for, those 3-by-7-inch color postcards posing as ducats. They cost $400 apiece and the two above would place you and a friend at courtside amid the celebrity elite at the season finale against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls: a chance to wave at Woody or have the Adonis-like Knicks forward Anthony Mason land in your lap. Gaze at the tickets now. Cut them out. Frame them. You may never see them again. At least not in your hand. Or your lifetime. WHAT ELSE: Cheaper Knicks tickets ($12 to $75) are scarcer than humility in George Steinbrenner or hair on Burt Reynolds's head. Thirty-three of the Knicks' 35 home games have sold out. Even scalpers need scalpers. WHERE: Madison Square Garden, 33d Street and Seventh Avenue. CULTURAL BENEFITS: Knicks games have become a nexus of New York culture (or stars just in from wherever), making the gaggle of glitterati that once accompanied Jack Nicholson and his sunglasses to courtside of Los Angeles Lakers games seem underpopulated. It is where film meets hip-hop meets politics meets sports. Only Swifty Lazar's Oscar-night party matches this eclectic turnout. WHO: There's Spike Lee in one of the 58 $400 courtside seats. And John McEnroe, Ronald Perelman, LL Cool J and Ahmad Rashad. Right behind the Knicks bench in his $75 club seat is Woody Allen (no longer spotted with Soon-Yi Farrow Previn). And there's Danny Aiello and Ed Bradley, Bill Murray and Peter Falk, Gloria Estefan and Senator Bill Bradley, Hammer and Rodney Dangerfield, Smokey Robinson and Dustin Hoffman, all sitting courtside. BENEFITS OF THE CULTURALLY ADVANTAGED: Star: \"Hello, this is Arnold. I'm holding up traffic in Times Square while I film my current movie. I'd like two at courtside, please.\" Garden: \"Why, of course, Mr. Schwarzenegger, we always keep eight courtside seats available for cultural icons and gazillionaires like yourself we'd like to showcase in our arena. Will any of the other Kennedys be accompanying you tonight?\" FASHION TIPS FOR THE SARTORIALLY DEPRIVED: The best seat affords scrutiny of Knicks Coach Pat Riley, poster boy for Giorgio Armani. Mr. Riley is a GQ dream, a man whom suits were made for and whom designers would love to dress and send down a runway. He may perspire in those immaculately tailored suits but he wouldn't let it show. When his Armani pants were split during a free-for-all last week against Phoenix, the rip was repaired at halftime. WATCH THE GAME, GET A DANCE: Except for eccentric Dancing Harry, who used to boogie in the stands and hex rival teams during the Knicks' heyday of the 1970's, the Garden had been dance needy until the Knicks City Girls arrived in 1991. The troupe of 15 Paula Abdul wannabes (Ms. Abdul, by the way, is an ex-Laker Girl) have eight outfits from which to choose during their halftime, timeout and between-quarters rock, rap, hip-hop and techno numbers. FUTURE AS HIP HANGOUT: As long as they win. But watch the Knicks crash in the playoffs, and Spike & Company will cross the Hudson for New Jersey Nets games. Stars have already abandoned the Lakers for the Clippers in Los Angeles, so there's precedent. Stars don't want to be seen with losers. It's boring. It's embarrassing. Would Arnold call if the Knicks had 19 victories and 45 losses? Does he go to Dallas Mavericks games? Get out of here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Amherst Coach Earned His Boot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/sports/l-amherst-coach-earned-his-boot-560994.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   Richard E.

Tifft and Alex S. Jones. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) Susan E. Tifft, a former Time magazine editor, collaborated with her husband, Alex S. Jones, a former New York Times reporter, on this saga of journalism's Kentucky barons. The book shows how the Binghams forged a new, liberal tradition for the Louisville press, only to lose all that they had built through family tragedy and bitter feuding. \"Others have told this story previously, but with nothing like this richness of appalling detail,\" Richard Kluger said here in 1991.     BEYOND THE CURVE, by Kobo Abe. Translated by Juliet Winters Carpenter. (Kodansha International, $8.) In this Japanese author's first collection of short fiction to be published in English, haunting, surreal situations continually endanger the characters' sense of self. One man is threatened with metamorphosis into a plant; another, not a man at all but a Martian, risks being committed to a mental hospital because he is, to all appearances, a human being. In 1991 our reviewer, Marian Ury, praised the \"many attractions\" of these \"ingenious stories.\" Kodansha International has also reissued Mr. Abe's novel THE RUINED MAP, translated by E. Dale Saunders ($13), in which a detective's own identity is inexorably lost to that of his quarry, a missing husband. It is \"a compelling tour de force that seems to have been built lovingly, word by word, sentence by sentence, by a master jeweler of polished prose,\" Shane Stevens said here in 1969.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Missteps in Waco: A Raid Re-examined/A special report.; U.S. Agents Say Fatal Flaws Doomed Raid on Waco Cult","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/us/missteps-waco-raid-re-examined-special-report-us-agents-say-fatal-flaws-doomed.html","abstract":"  Several Federal agents involved in the violent raid on a heavily armed cult in Texas dispute official descriptions of the operation as well planned, likening it instead to the Charge of the Light Brigade, laden with missteps, miscalculations and unheeded warnings that could have averted bloodshed.

Mr. Wilk, whose many books include \"The Golden Age of Television\" and \"Every Day's a Matinee,\" tells the story with vigor, relying whenever possible on the words of the participants -- including, besides Miss de Mille, Rodgers and Hammerstein, the producer Theresa Helburn, the director Rouben Mamoulian, the conductor Jay Blackton and the costume designer Miles White.

One of the most popular children's-book series ever written -- it's estimated that 80 million copies have been sold in more than 20 languages -- has finally decided to go the route of animation.    \"The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends,\" its six exquisite episodes costing a hefty $11 million, is timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 1893 Beatrix Potter \"picture letter\" to a 5-year-old, which became the foundation for the subsequent books. Miss Potter, who died in 1943 at the age of 77, left the rights to her work to Frederick Warne & Company, the exclusive publishers of the stories from the beginning. As both writer and illustrator, Miss Potter was not enthusiastic about animation.
