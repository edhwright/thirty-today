In \"The Loman Family Picnic,\" a deceptively sketchy portrait of an uncomfortably married Jewish couple and their two young sons in Brooklyn in 1965, Donald Margulies has taken material as stale as yesterday's bagel and woven it into a phantasmagorical comedy of both lacerating humor and infinite compassion.   Though the play is more of an embroidered conceit than a cogently worked out drama (as Mr. Margulies provided in last year's \"Sight Unseen\"), it generates its own enduring resonance as a study in the wistful, self-conscious fantasies that emerge from mundane lives. And bolstered by two impeccable central performances, this production finds a tone of bizarrely heightened naturalism that can accommodate both the play's deliberate banality and its high-flying whimsy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931119","headline":"THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Labor; Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html","abstract":"  Leaders of the nation's labor unions today swore to get even with the representatives who voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and they accused President Clinton of outright political bribery in his deals to win votes for the pact.

Unger recognizes the changing political sentiments in Taiwan regarding the island's international status. His call for Washington and Asian states to begin a diplomatic dialogue in preparation for an independent Taiwan is also laudable.   However, the statement that \"Taiwanese nationalists distinguish themselves from 'mainlanders' \" deserves clarification. The officially sanctioned line between \"Taiwanese\" and \"mainlanders\" has been steadily breaking down as a result of intermarriages and, more important, political liberalization. Being Taiwanese has almost exclusively been associated with the native (nonmainlander) population, but today \"mainlanders\" are increasingly calling themselves \"first- or second-generation Taiwanese,\" acknowledging their adopted home or birthplace.   A fairly young organization called Mainlander Association for Taiwanese Independence promotes not only its stated mission but also the peaceful coexistence of the island's diverse populations. In view of Taiwan's long and often turbulent immigration history, this development is to be welcomed. HENRY H.

The Masked Dancers of Losari, accompanied by a full gamelan orchestra, were led by Sawitri Sumitra, a 64-year-old performer known as Sawitri, who is celebrated for her interpretation of the Losari style, which developed in relative isolation. In addition to a somewhat different handling of the traditional masked-dance repertory and the different placement of the orchestra onstage, Losari dancing is distinguished by an angular, abrupt attack that gives its performers the look of hinged, stylized Indonesian shadow dance puppets. The dancers portrayed characters, in solos and duets, rather than telling fully developed narratives. Their masks, serene, fierce or grotesque, offered clues to whether they were good or evil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931120","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/nyregion/metro-digest-464793.html","abstract":"   ROLLINS EXPLAINS HIS ASSERTIONS   Sometimes expressing bewilderment and at other times turning morbidly plaintive, Edward J.

Unfortunately, the Philharmonic didn't seem to be in the mood to dance. The Strauss, at the beginning of the program, received an alarmingly drab and desultory performance. Here is a score marked with instructions like \"grazioso,\" \"galante,\" \"animato\" and, over and over, \"schnell\" -- fast.

The mail has its own magic, its own intriguing rhythms, especially when it arrives unaccountably in a distant place. Hardly anything adds more mystery and importance to a trip than the alluring words Poste Restante, Postlagernd, or even General Delivery on an itinerary passed along to potential correspondents. For trips a little closer to home, mail received at summer cottages near the sea or woodland resorts pleasantly interrupts the hot, lazy days, calls for a glass of iced tea on the porch and generates a tingle of excitement at the prospect of real letters -- from elderly aunts, or foreign friends, or kids at camp -- to be read and passed around. And when a witty postcard reports on a giant fiberglass peach or chicken or other roadside oddity, even mere weekend jaunts become travel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Wiring the World for Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/books/wiring-the-world-for-politics.html","abstract":"THE ROAR OF THE CROWD\nHow Television and People Power\nAre Changing the World.\nBy Michael J.

Recently, the Bard Music Festival, which devoted two weekends to Dvorak in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., in August, followed up with another at Alice Tully Hall.

As his dear friend Howard L. Bingham, a photographer, has said: \"He was born for the camera. . . . No one in the world has a face like Ali.\" For MUHAMMAD ALI: A Thirty-Year Journey (Simon & Schuster, $32.50), Mr. Bingham has selected nearly 200 black-and-white photographs from the one million pictures he has taken of Ali since 1962. The book, like its subject, is exceptional. It includes a fair number of ringside photos, but we also see Ali hanging out in Harlem with Sugar Ray Robinson and Roy Campanella; having his snapshot taken by Malcolm X and his ear bent by Jesse Jackson; playfully sneaking up on the ferocious Sonny Liston in a Miami bar in 1963 (even Elijah Muhammad picked Liston to win their fight the following year); and just generally having a good time, with folks sublime (Duke Ellington, Sam Cooke) and ridiculous (Sonny Bono, Don Knotts). When Wilfrid Sheed was writing the text for a picture book on Ali two decades ago, he pored over thousands of photographs and never came upon a single nasty one. Ali looks angry only once in Mr. Bingham's book, on the day in 1967 when he was indicted for refusing induction into the armed forces. Yet the man who had no quarrel with the Vietcong never seemed to hold a grudge against anybody, not even the bigots and boobs who kept him out of boxing for three and a half years and made sure that no one would see the athlete of the century at his peak. In the private, quiet moments depicted here, past and present, Ali comes across as too nice, too gentle, for bitterness. He used to brag that he could hospitalize a brick. He could probably get one to crack a smile too.

But the stars of the Italian Blue Team are all dead or retired, and the American teams are never quite as strong as they used to be -- or could be. The reason is that nearly all the teams that challenge for the right to represent the United States include a playing sponsor, usually a player somewhat below the top rank who is willing to pay a large amount for a chance to win a world title.    As a result, in recent years there have been no clear favorites and several surprises: Brazil won in 1989, Iceland in 1991 and the Netherlands two months ago in Santiago, Chile. The Brazilian team, cheered on by local enthusiasts hoping for a Latin American victory, came close in Santiago. They were handicapped by the absence of Marcelo Branco, a multiple world champion who was forced to put work ahead of bridge, but they still reached the semifinal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Nets Are Rejected and Dejected: 15 Blocks by O'Neal; Coleman Hurt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/sports/pro-basketball-nets-are-rejected-and-dejected-15-blocks-by-o-neal-coleman-hurt.html","abstract":"  On one of his visits to the Meadowlands last season, Orlando center Shaquille O'Neal provided the highlight footage for a host of television sports shows by breaking down the backboard.

But because many historic towns were built on the bluffs and the big cities that draw the majority of tourists were fortified by flood walls, the rivers that consumed the bottomlands left most of the region's major tourist sites -- including the Mall of America outside Minneapolis and the Gateway Arch and the Anheuser-Busch brewery in St. Louis -- virtually untouched.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"All Mixed Up?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/books/l-all-mixed-up-568593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I suppose you've received bags of letters from the ones in millions who have or have had the \"disorder\" of synesthesia.

That and the residents watching anxiously as the garbage piles up and the rats return.   The lot, a large L that turns the corner and opens onto 100th Street, has been leased by a development group run by several local churches. With a little soil, some trees and a few benches it will become a small park designed by residents of the block and local gardeners in search of a place to wield their green thumbs. But the city finances that the organizers are counting on are mired in bureaucratic reviews.   \"I hope the city will loosen up the funds so we can go ahead,\" said the Rev. Robert V. Lott, chairman of SFDS Development Corporation, which leased the lot. \"It seems like forever.\"   The group has been working with a nonprofit group that promotes green space, the Parks Council, which has lobbied the city to include money to help turn city-owned lots in low-income neighborhoods into pocket parks.  This year's city budget includes $1.25 million for such projects, but the Parks Council is one of several groups vying for the money. And each site must go through the city's land-review process, including many public hearings, so the $40,000 to $50,000 that the garden is waiting for may not be available until spring, or even summer.   Karen Phillips, who works for the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which is involved in another planned garden, called the process frustrating but necessary. \"Unfortunately, it's slow, but it's set up so it's not business as usual, so people in the community have a say in what's done with the land,\" she said.   Depite the delay, Linda Davidoff, the executive director of the Parks Council, said she was optimistic that the money would be available. \"I think this is a perfect opening program for the Giuliani administration, because it takes an existing city resource and mixes it with a very tiny amount of city funding to make a substantial transformation in low-income communities,\" she said.   Neighbors on 100th Street try to match Ms. Davidoff's enthusiasm, but it is hard. The lot was cleared a few months ago, and the fence paid for with private money. But the fence is not enough.   \"Look at that garbage,\" said Charlotte Hodge, a longtime member of the Ebenezer Wesleyan Methodist Church, which is next to the lot. \"It wasn't here a few weeks ago. Why can't people respect it?\" EMILY M.

With the exception of Ossorio, these artists, whether or not they stuck with egg tempera, pursued the Magic Realism to which the medium lent itself.

My children might never have known about these creatures if the resy were not here. We don't want to lose it.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"For Film Exposure, Timing Is the Key","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/camera-for-film-exposure-timing-is-the-key.html","abstract":"  THE process of exposing film can be approached scientifically, with the film's light sensitivity plotted on a graph and the world divided into zones of gray. The careful photographer can take light-meter readings of all the parts of a scene, match them to zones of gray and then figure out just which setting to expose the film for, taking into account the leeway that development can offer.   But I tend to think of exposure in terms that are a little more mundane: for me, it's like cooking. Turn on the oven, stick in a chicken and a while later it's done. So it is with exposure, at least in my mind. Let the right amount of light fall on the negative, and in a little while (usually less time than it takes to cook a chicken), the negative is done.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Shining a Light on the Other de Kooning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/nyregion/shining-a-light-on-the-other-de-kooning.html","abstract":"  \"THAT such a great consciousness should cease to exist,\" Mercedes Matter said as she left the bedside of her friend Elaine de Kooning.

IDENTITY: Retired chairman of Bloomingdale's; 68-year-old president of Marvin Traub Associates, a consulting and retailing company.    NEW BOOK: \"Like No Other Store . . . The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Evolution in American Marketing,\" (Times Books, $25). The final chapters are devoted to Bloomingdale's period of bankruptcy after Robert Campeau took over its parent, Federated Department Stores, in 1988.    CURRENT CLIENTS: Ralph Lauren, American Express and Saks Fifth Avenue. Marvin Traub Associates also owns Conran's Habitat, the chain of home furnishing stores.    Q.  Do you still shop at Bloomingdale's?    A.  I was there about 10 days ago. I was in the men's store and I ordered some shirts.    Q.  But you don't have to be loyal anymore, do you?   A.  I also shop at Saks as well as Paul Stuart. When I was at Bloomingdale's, 90 percent of my purchases were there, as were Mrs. Traub's. I had a rule: she could shop anyplace she wanted as long as she bought at Bloomingdale's.   Q.  What have you been up to since leaving in 1991?    A.  I've worked with QVC. I originally took Diane Von Furstenburg to QVC, as I say in the book, and through Diane, Barry Diller became very much involved. I've brought a number of different projects to them, including Barbara Taylor Bradford. When it was a great success, the folks at QVC said, \"Marvin, when your book comes out, we'll work together with you on it.\"   Q.  So you're planning to go on the air to sell it?   A.  Yes. It will probably happen sometime in early December.    Q.  Hasn't QVC had too much hype though?   A.  It's interesting to think that the total volume of QVC, Home Shopping Network and all the infomercials that are made is a little more than 15 percent of J. C. Penney's sales. It is a very tiny business, but it will grow. It will not replace people going into department stores or shopping centers.   Q.  What else are you doing?   A.  We started a business with Elizabeth Taylor for costume jewelry, which Avon is making. It's being launched this month. We have another company we started up with Iman, the model. We are doing a line of cosmetics and skin care for women of color.    Q.  What do you think of the direction of Bloomingdale's since you left?   A.  I think I have made it plain in the book that I have a concern that Bloomingdale's maintain a level of uniqueness that excited people to shop there. I know there's an enormous profit pressure that makes it hard to do either a country promotion or some major new idea.    Q.  What do you mean \"concern\"?    A.  The emphasis is on other things. I'm being very measured because I really don't want to seem like sour grapes.    Q.  You do say in the book that you didn't like Michael Gould, your successor as chairman.    A.  Mike was not my first choice for the job, but Mike does have the job, so I'd like him to be successful. For the sake of all the people there and everything we've built.    Q.  You don't mince words about Robert Campeau either. You even imply that he cheats at golf.    A.  He was just driven to win at most any cost. He had some sound ideas and some excesses.    Q.  Having once tried to lead a management buyout of Bloomingdale's, are you disappointedthat you don't own the store?   A.  No. I loved running Bloomingdale's, but with this new second career I am as busy as I've ever been.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"The Renaissance Of an Art Form","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/coins-the-renaissance-of-an-art-form.html","abstract":"  MEDALLIC sculpture began as an art form in Europe during the Renaissance, but since then it's never risen to a position of much prominence.

Belting an octave above his partner, Mr. John, who sounds chipper no matter what he's singing, supplies the gospel-blues fervor that Mr. Cohen studiously subverts.    In its juxtaposition of two voices that sharply pull against each other, \"Born to Lose\" is similar to the Bono-Frank Sinatra teaming on Mr. Sinatra's recent \"Duets\" album, a record with which Mr. John's is bound to be compared.

Its mountain spine, still draped in darkness, falls sharply to the sea; a minute or two later, strengthening sunlight makes shadow play of the scene -- curving coast, fingers of land, sprinklings of islands all rippling across the glaring screen of the Hauraki Gulf until the plane swoops in over Auckland's morning traffic.\n\nOnce on the ground, foreign travelers tend to bypass the Coromandel Peninsula. But its compact mix of west coast harbors and east side sand, with forest trails, volcanic pinnacles, waterfalls and damp gorges in between, make it a favorite among New Zealanders, who consider it one of their most scenic regions. That endorsement -- impressive considering the country's better-known contenders -- led my husband, Gregory Foote, and me to the peninsula eight years ago, when we stopped for a few days in New Zealand on a two-month round-the-world blitz. We were newlyweds, traveling light; but this year, on our third trip to New Zealand, the peninsula's proximity to Auckland -- about a two-hour drive away -- made it a prime draw for us and our two little boys. So did the Coromandel's unusual, sometime subtle layerings of natural and human history, best uncovered at a pace that leaves plenty of time for serendipity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Trade Pact Offers Chance to Export Our Ideals; A Bleak Future Looms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/opinion/l-trade-pact-offers-chance-to-export-our-ideals-a-bleak-future-looms-953993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a very longtime reader, I do not believe I have ever seen you use such a tone as that in \"Running Scared From Nafta\" (editorial, Nov. 16).

Wars and civil wars that no one seems to have the power or determination to stop -- in the former Yugoslavia, in Georgia and Azerbaijan, in Northern Ireland, in Nigeria -- continue unabated. And what might be called the undeclared wars in our cities, from Los Angeles to Johannesburg, also spiral out of control. \n\nI do not have a solution to this pervasive manifestation of violence. But it seems to me that if we frame our idea of violence as an aberration, a deviation from the path of normality, we are making a profound error. We run the risk of unwittingly justifying neglect of whole segments of society while ignoring the increasing power of violence generated by society itself, which in modern life increasingly seems to isolate and brutalize the individual. We cannot hope to solve the problem of escalating violence until we have redefined the concept of violence and changed our perception of it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Recreating A Spirit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/on-the-street-recreating-a-spirit.html","abstract":"  There's a playfulness that comes with the last days of fall, when coats are discarded to catch the last rays of Indian summer.

The city's historic center is one of the biggest in Europe, and the only one where bomb damage from World War II is still to be found. Heaps of decaying garbage molder next to heaps of decaying stone; crumbling churches and palaces punctuate the Levantine hurly-burly of street markets with their piles of brilliantly colored fish and vegetables, their canvas awnings framing a medieval tower or the iron gratings of a 17th-century convent; dark and lonely alleys are crisscrossed by wooden beams that prop up tottering houses where -- often despite doors sealed by the town government -- clandestine immigrants from the third world exercise squatters' rights.   Cautious tourists dart in from the main thoroughfares just far enough and long enough to visit the neighborhood's churches and museums; food enthusiasts brave the push-and-shove to admire the spectacular displays of the markets and ponder the unfamiliar produce; the adventurous attempt to pursue an itinerary through the maze of narrow streets, or simply wander where they fancy. But everyone, whether fueled by esthetic, gastronomic or sociological curiosity, comes up against padlocked gates and unanswered questions.
