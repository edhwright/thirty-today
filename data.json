Giuliani's decision to do what once might have seemed unthinkable came down to a simple calculation: that whatever damage he might do to his standing as a Republican, on balance his political, governmental and personal self-interests would best be served by having Mario M. Cuomo as Governor, and so he should do all he could to assure it.   Mr. Giuliani's bold stroke put him squarely in the mold of the Mayor he most admires: Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Republican eclectic who captivated and cultivated his city for three terms through Depression and war on the strength of bipartisan elan and alliances, yet was ultimately frustrated in his hopes for a bigger spot on the national stage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941025","headline":"Comptroller Faults Foe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/25/nyregion/comptroller-faults-foe.html","abstract":"  H.

Scientists at Pennsylvania State University hypothesize, however, that a present-day flightless insect called the stone-fly may be closely related to ancestral insects that first learned to fly more than 330 million years ago.   Last February, Dr. James H. Marden, a biologist at Pennsylvania State University, and Melissa G. Kramer, his student, began studying the behavior and biology of stoneflies -- the immature nymphs of which are familiar to many fishermen as delicacies for trout. The nymphs begin life in river or pond water and then develop primitive wings enabling them to skim across water at high speed without actually taking to the air. Dr. Marden and Ms. Kramer have concluded that the humble ancestor of such expert fliers as mosquitoes and wasps may have been very much like the stone-fly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941025","headline":"Infant Killed in House Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/25/nyregion/infant-killed-in-house-fire.html","abstract":"  An 18-month-old girl was killed yesterday when a fire engulfed the top floor of her family's two-story row house in East New York, Brooklyn, trapping the infant and her brother, fire officials said.

Two years ago, Jets receiver Al Toon retired when he couldn't shake the effects of a concussion.

The Mayor has made impressive headway in reducing the city payroll and negotiating better contracts with city unions. But it is time now to squeeze harder.    If the June reductions were painful, the new cuts will be more so because they carve deeper into programs that have already been trimmed.

His shorts, many evoking Poe or Kafka, bring the menace of the subconscious to life, and his extraordinary feature \"Alice\" depicts an eerie wonderland darker than any Lewis Carroll dared. His new feature, \"Faust,\" combines his usual mix of animated elements with a great deal of live action to tell an updated version of the old devilish story; the result will probably be more intriguing to Svankmajer cultists than to newcomers.    Mr. Svankmajer's Faust (Petr Cepek) is a dour-looking man who lives in today's Prague and is first seen walking out of a subway. He is handed a map with a large red mark on it, and eventually follows the directions to a ramshackle building that conceals an abandoned dressing room.

Yet this gentle ceremony for 26 dancers seemed at home in a house of worship.    Dancers kept sitting on benches at one side of the space like members of a choir. A couple on small platforms struck poses as if they were squirmy saints. The choreography often celebrated communal harmony, especially in passages of jolly hops and in sequences in which everyone danced in a ring and joyfully slapped their knees. At one point, dancers darted forward, buzzing like euphoric bees.

But the intriguing stop will be the meeting tomorrow in Damascus with Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad.    White House officials see the treaty signing as a chance to lift the President out of the gloom of a frustrating midterm election campaign and emphasize his recent foreign policy successes in Haiti, North Korea and Iraq. If he can somehow manage to add substance in Syria to ceremony on the Israel-Jordan border, he can improve his Presidential image as well as the prospects for Mideast peace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941026","headline":"Another British Minister Resigns Over Outside Lobbying Deals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/world/another-british-minister-resigns-over-outside-lobbying-deals.html","abstract":"  A junior British Government minister resigned today over reports that he failed to disclose outside lobbying deals, the second junior minister to quit under a cloud in a week, leaving Prime Minister John Major scrambling to limit the political damage from questions about his Conservative Party's ethical standards.

There is a second chapter to the story of Peekskill's boom. In 1984, after he resigned as Mayor to become a State Assemblyman, Mr. Pataki, the most powerful politician in this Republican-controlled town, began seeking the financial benefits of the real-estate boom he helped create.

This is Mr. Kerrey's response to an association's advertisement featuring the actor Charlton Heston, who asserted: \"You said you wouldn't vote for gun bans. But you went to Washington and voted for the first Federal gun ban in American history.\" PRODUCER Struble/Totten Communications ON THE SCREEN Opens with men on a shooting range, with red letters declaring, \"A Message to Charlton Heston from Bob Kerrey.\" The camera zooms in on Mr. Kerrey, dressed in hunting garb, as he fires at a clay pigeon. As he talks into the camera, he ejects the shell from the shotgun he just used, and then, midway through, puts the gun down and picks up another weapon. SCRIPT An announcer says, \"A message for Charlton Heston from Senator Bob Kerrey.\" Then Mr. Kerrey says: \"I'm a hunter, and I believe in the constitutional right to bear arms. When it's time to hunt birds, you need a good gun like this Ruger Red Label. Twenty-five years ago, in the war in Vietnam, people hunted me. They needed a good weapon -- like this AK-47. But you don't need one of these to hunt birds.\" The announcer then says: \"Bob Kerrey. The courage to lead.\" ACCURACY The distinction Mr. Kerrey draws is correct. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that the semi-automatic version of the AK-47 would be covered by the ban in the crime bill, which covers 19 types of semi-automatic weapons. The spokesman also said that shotguns like the Ruger Red Label would be unaffected by the ban. SCORECARD The ad is a tough response to a tough attack: Mr. Kerrey deals head-on with the charge that his support for a ban on semi-automatic weapons was a sellout of Nebraska hunters and gun owners. By word and message, he is trying to tell hunters that he is one of them. And, as is often the case with Mr. Kerrey, his background as a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he lost a leg and won the Medal of Honor, gives a political argument an emotional punch.
