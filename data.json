The University of Massachusetts would step out of the Atlantic 10, take on the world and make a splash.   But the world around the Minutemen has changed, and so has the UMass modus operandi. A bold statement was not necessary this afternoon when the Minutemen defeated a young, outmanned group of Louisville Cardinals, 91-76, at the Centrum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Tempering Troubled Waters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/us/woman-in-the-news-myrlie-evers-williams-tempering-troubled-waters.html","abstract":"  At a noisy time in an organization never known for its quiet understatement, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has turned to a leader who has shown that her silences can be as powerful as any oratory.   When Myrlie Evers-Williams took her place before a restless crowd of supporters on Saturday night after a raucous day of chants, shouts and loud complaint, the packed ballroom fell quiet. The newly elected board chairwoman of the rights organization calmly adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses and smiled. Without a word, she raised her hands to her lips. Then she blew the room a kiss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Whitman to Talk on Schools","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-whitman-to-talk-on-schools.html","abstract":"  The state's school system will be the topic when Gov.

To that end, the widow of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers struck a conciliatory tone that she hopes will shift the focus from unseemly talk of financial misdeeds and sexual harassment toward an era of renewed relevance for the 86-year-old National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Serbia Dazzles Itself: Terror Suspect Weds Singer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/world/serbia-dazzles-itself-terror-suspect-weds-singer.html","abstract":"  In a ceremony billed as Serbia's wedding of the decade, if not perhaps the century, the baby-faced Serbian paramilitary commander known as Arkan today took his country's best loved folk singer as his bride.   On one level, it was no more than the union of a rich thug with a particularly nasty war record and a glamorous young star with a hold on the hearts of Serbia. But the wedding of Arkan and Ceca (pronounced tseh-tsa) turned into a kitsch pageant of Serbia's disarray.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"For Health Agency, a Fiscal Wake-Up Call","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/us/for-health-agency-a-fiscal-wake-up-call.html","abstract":"  Few agencies have ever enjoyed stronger bipartisan support than the National Institutes of Health. Indeed, Congress has lavished billions of tax dollars on the Government's biomedical research enterprise. And until now, the main question was how best to spend more money.   But that has abruptly changed.  The health agency is receiving skeptical scrutiny from Republican members of the House determined to cut the Federal budget deficit. This change is most evident in the House Appropriations subcommittee that earmarks money for the institutes, $11.3 billion this year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/nyregion/bridge-517795.html","abstract":"  Bridge is perhaps the only competitive activity in which players can not only take part when facing major health problems but even win. Early last year, a 46-year-old professional from Nashville, Bob Glenn, embarked on an ambitious tournament program, hoping to win the title for collecting most master points in the calendar year. He did not feel well, and in March was told that he had inoperable pancreatic cancer, but he went on playing, and winning, until he died in June. He had accumulated more than 1,000 master points in five months.   For some, it appears that the drive to succeed at the bridge table helps keeps health problems at bay. An example is Lila Perlstein of Roslyn Heights, L.I., an expert who, despite a chronic illness, won two major titles last month at the Tri-State Regional Championships in Port Chester, N.Y. Six weeks earlier, at the Fall Nationals in Minneapolis, she held the South cards on the diagramed deal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Chinese Executive Tied to Deng Is Arrested in Corruption Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/world/chinese-executive-tied-to-deng-is-arrested-in-corruption-case.html","abstract":"  In a corruption case that strikes close to China's first family, a prominent steel company chairman and close friend of Deng Xiaoping has resigned and his son has been arrested for \"certain commercial crimes,\" Chinese officials said this weekend.

It is a callous and shortsighted idea that should be disowned by the committee.   The United States contributes money to the United Nations Development Program -- which the proposal also threatens -- as well as several development banks, the most important of which is the World Bank. Other recipients include the Africa, Asia and Inter-American development banks, which lend to poor countries for economic development.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Star Violinist Back After An Injury","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/arts/classical-music-star-violinist-back-after-an-injury.html","abstract":"  Notes from the infirmary: Daniele Gatti, a rising Italian maestro who was to have starred in the New York Philharmonic's conductor-debut week, beginning last Thursday, had to cancel because of a shoulder injury. But the violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg returned to action for the first time since she sliced the little finger of her left hand late last year. She played Barber's Concerto with the orchestra and its substitute conductor, Neeme Jarvi, who was not exactly a debutant.   Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg, it has been suggested, may be entering a stage of settled maturity, jolted to a new seriousness in part by her accident. She looked her old self on Thursday, however, bobbing and weaving, mooning and grimacing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Book Links Former British Labor Party Chief to K.G.B.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/world/book-links-former-british-labor-party-chief-to-kgb.html","abstract":"  A British newspaper reported today that Michael Foot, the leader of the opposition Labor Party in the early 1980's, had met with Soviet K.G.B. agents during the 1960's and accepted a series of cash payments for a left-wing newspaper he ran.

Marlin became the first driver to win consecutive Daytona 500's since Cale Yarborough did it in 1983-84. He held off a charging Dale Earnhardt to win by 0.61 seconds and earn $300,460. The 37-year-old driver from Columbia, Tenn., led for 105 of the 200 laps, but that does not adequately reflect his domination today. The only thing that stopped him was rain, which halted the race for 1 hour 44 minutes after 71 laps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Sports of The Times; Riley Sent a Message To a Particular Point","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/sports/sports-of-the-times-riley-sent-a-message-to-a-particular-point.html","abstract":"  PAT RILEY wanted us to think he'd said more than he intended to say. \"You sucked me right in,\" the Knicks coach said after his team's 122-117 victory over Houston yesterday, which was if nothing else a professional effort against the defending champs and their newest star, Clyde Drexler.   Sure we did. We took Riley into the bowels of Madison Square Garden, bound him to a chair, offered him drags on a cigarette, put a gun to his head, made him sing.

The White House has already made clear that it intends to seek a Senate vote on Dr. Foster, and Senator Dole's comments in a television interview this morning suggested that the Clinton Administration's strategy of painting Dr. Foster's opponents as captives of the anti-abortion movement is proving discomfiting for Senate Republicans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950220","headline":"New Jersey Shows Links In Tax Levels Are Complex","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/nyregion/new-jersey-shows-links-in-tax-levels-are-complex.html","abstract":"  Boiled down to its essentials, the criticism of Gov.

After four years of Federal investigation, the Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation reached an antitrust settlement designed to end unfair, anticompetitive practices by the software giant. But neither Judge Sporkin nor any other outsider has the foggiest idea whether the agreement is adequate or a mere wrist slap when stronger measures are needed.   We still don't know whether Microsoft for the most part competes fairly, in which case it is a crown jewel of the American economy, just the sort of technological and business success this nation badly needs to compete in world markets in the coming information age. Or is Microsoft a predator that uses its market dominance to freeze out the superior products of competitors while insuring success for clunkier products of its own?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Blair Takes Another Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/sports/figure-skating-blair-takes-another-title.html","abstract":"  Serenaded by 300 friends and family members ringing cowbells and singing \"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean,\" Bonnie Blair won her second consecutive world sprint speed-skating championship today at the Pettit National Ice Center.

The election of Myrlie Evers-Williams as chairman vouches that the N.A.A.C.P. is ready for its own journey back from the brink.   Mrs. Evers-Williams's challenges are formidable, but she has several advantages. One is her deep personal tie to a civil rights group whose history is its most sacred asset. She is the widow of Medgar Evers, a truly heroic figure in the Southern civil rights movement. She worked at her husband's side in that lonely and dangerous outpost of justice, the Jackson, Miss., field office of the N.A.A.C.P. After Mr. Evers's murder in 1963, she never flagged in a 31-year crusade to put his killer in jail.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950221","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/nyregion/metro-digest-905995.html","abstract":"  A TRIBE'S CLOSE TIES TO EDUCATION   In July 1990, Margaret Field, headmaster of the Pine Point School, went to sing the praises of private education to leaders of the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe in Ledyard.

Researchers who study the carotenoids, the family of nutrients to which beta carotene belongs, are now thinking that beta carotene may be only partly responsible for the health benefits that have been attributed to it, and that one or more of the hundreds of other carotenoids should be sharing, if not stealing, the limelight.   Using modern laboratory methods, chemists have recently identified more than 600 carotenoids in plants, including about 40 that are prominent in common fruits and vegetables. Beta carotene has long been the focus of attention for three main reasons: it makes up about one-quarter of edible carotenoids, it is the one that is most efficiently converted in the body into vitamin A and it is a powerful antioxidant that may block free radical damage to cell membranes and body chemicals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950221","headline":"Islanders' Big Effort Spoiled by a Fluke Overtime Goal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/sports/hockey-islanders-big-effort-spoiled-by-a-fluke-overtime-goal.html","abstract":"  After playing one of their best games of the season and coming from behind to force overtime, the Islanders lost tonight by 3-2 to the Montreal Canadiens in a thriller at the Forum.

Define the Issue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/us/anti-crime-bill-as-political-dispute-president-and-gop-define-the-issue.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 Most Americans think that having more police officers on the streets is a good way to fight crime. So do most police officers and both political parties. So why, in the recent House debate over crime legislation, did the matter of providing more police become the central dispute and the magnet that drew President Clinton's first explicit threat to veto a bill?   The basic dynamic driving the legislation that emerged from the House last week was this: Mr. Clinton and the Democrats swiped the crime issue from the Republicans. Then the Republicans got it back, not by any bold move but by relentless criticism of the 1994 anti-crime legislation. With last November's elections having left the Democrats in disarray on virtually every front, the President now finds himself fighting desperately to reclaim the issue. - Tony Blankley, press secretary for Speaker Newt Gingrich, summed up the Democrats' situation by quoting an old American position on the Panama Canal: \"You can't take it from us, because we stole it fair and square.\"   Never mind that many criminologists believe that crime cannot be fought with Federal legislation. Never mind that previous efforts from Washington have generally been considered ineffective.   For Republicans, the crime issue has been theirs almost by birthright. It was only when a Democratic candidate for President finally said, as Mr. Clinton did in 1992, that he favored the death penalty -- and allowed the execution of a brain-damaged man to go forward before the New Hampshire primary -- that the Republicans began to lose the issue.   Public opinion polls in January 1994 showed crime overtaking the economy as the biggest perceived problem facing the nation. And for the first time, voters thought Democrats and Republicans could handle it equally well.   Since then, the President has signed into law some popular crime-fighting measures. These include a ban on assault weapons and a three-strikes-and-you're-out provision that imposes life sentences on criminals convicted of a Federal crime after two previous convictions.   The Republicans, who can read polls as well as anyone, did not challenge either the ban or the three-strikes proposal in their Contract With America, their 1994 campaign manifesto.   Nor did the contract directly challenge another major element of last year's anti-crime law -- Mr. Clinton's pledge to put 100,000 additional police officers on the street.   The contract's main thrust on crime was to build more prisons, make prisoners serve longer sentences, prevent criminals from getting off on technicalities and cut the prevention programs that Democrats had stuffed into last year's bill.   While there are deep philosophical differences between the parties over how to fight crime, Republicans in the House did not really object to the Democrats' desire to hire more police officers. Indeed, the contract called for \"additional law enforcement,\" an acknowledgment that this was a good idea.   But they saw the President's pledge for 100,000 new officers as dishonest, saying the bill would not come close to paying for that many and would provide communities with only seed money for five years. They also argued that some communities did not need or want more officers, and that the legislation should have concentrated the new officers in high-crime areas. And they portrayed the prevention programs as wasteful social spending.   So the contract collapsed last year's money for police and prevention into a lump sum, or block grant, of $10 billion over five years for local communities to fight crime any way they deemed fit, including the hiring of more police officers.   Over the last two weeks, this provision became the most contentious in the new crime bill, eclipsing other divisive matters that had blocked agreement on crime legislation for nearly a decade. These included measures to allow officers to make searches without warrants and to speed up carrying out executions, in part by ordering Federal courts to defer to state courts.   The Republican changes brought protests from some liberals and some lawyers, who said the changes were a direct assault on fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. (The Republicans even voted down an amendment, proposed by the Democrats, that contained the exact language of the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unlawful searches.)   But for the most part, the Republican changes sailed through the House. Even Mr. Clinton, who once taught constitutional law, did not put up a fuss.   The fact is that these constitutional safeguards are political losers with a public fed up with criminals getting off on technicalities and tired of waiting years for executions to be carried out. Being against them would put Mr. Clinton on the wrong, \"old Democrat\" side of crime.   He made his stand instead on the 100,000 new officers and, for the first time in his White House tenure, he pledged to use the veto against a specific piece of legislation. It was, after all, one of the most visible of his campaign promises to become law, and to retreat on it now would have been unthinkable.   \"It's one of his few popular accomplishments,\" said a Democratic aide in Congress. \"If he lost that it would be a major blow. The White House has probably already cut their commercials for '96 on the 100,000 cops.\"   Even Republicans concede, if backhandedly, that the veto threat on the police issue worked to the President's advantage.   \"They run an Administration by survey research,\" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. And the research shows that governors, mayors and voters believe that more police officers on the beat, along with keeping criminals in prison for their full sentences, is the most effective way to fight crime.\"   Since the November elections, the Administration has been searching for ways to reassert itself. The crime issue, which Mr. Clinton had turned to his advantage before, provides a logical opportunity.   \"There was a feeling that the best way to differentiate himself from the opposition was to make positive pronouncements and to draw lines in the sand,\" said the Democratic aide. \"There was a feeling that he hadn't done a particularly good job with either, and there has been pressure on him to pick a couple of battles.\"   While the Democrats lost the vote in the House on protecting money for the additional police officers, they had other reasons to rejoice: a vote on a separate amendment indicated that they had the numbers to block any attempt to override a veto.   Moreover, the Democrats appeared to have won the war of words. They were able to frame the debate so that it looked as if the Republicans were eliminating 100,000 police officers -- even though they believed their own bill would provide for more officers than the Clinton measure would if local governments chose to spend all of the money on additional police.   And the veto threat, strengthened by the strong support from House Democrats, also translated quickly into hints of accommodation from Republicans in the Senate, where the bills will be taken up next month.   The Senate seems likely to be more accommodating than the House anyway. Some Republican senators do not like block grants for the same reason that House Republicans once opposed them: the money can easily be diverted from its intended purpose.   But the politics could still prove tricky for Mr. Clinton. The Senate could eliminate money for the 100,000 police officers but send the President an otherwise tough anti-crime package in a single bill.   Mr. Blankley, the Gingrich spokesman, said it would be a bad idea for Mr. Clinton to veto such a measure.   \"The way information gets communicated to a general audience is not in multiple paragraphs, but in snippets of headlines, and I don't think he and his party are currently positioned to win in that snippet-information process,\" Mr. Blankley said. \"If he seems to be fighting the Republicans on crime, most people would correctly assume he's wrong. It's been a Republican issue for over 100 years. It's counterintuitive to think that the head of the Democratic Party is tougher.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950221","headline":"Tribute to Robin Williams","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/movies/tribute-to-robin-williams.html","abstract":"  The American Museum of the Moving Image is to honor Robin Williams at its 10th annual tribute Thursday night at the Waldorf-Astoria.

Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket, which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19950221","time":"1995-02-21

Because we now live in an age when governments are basically broke, the only way for most countries to raise cash for development is either to enforce savings at home or attract investors from the world's major bond markets. Moody's is the credit rating agency that signals the electronic herd of global investors where to plunk down their money, by telling them which countries' bonds are blue-chip and which are junk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/style/chronicle-869095.html","abstract":"  The winners of the 1995 Matrix Award given by New York Women in Communications for exceptional accomplishment have been announced.

As I report in \"An Eye for an Eye,\" the camps in Poland in 1945 weren't for Nazis but for German civilians, of whom less than 1 percent were ever indicted as Nazis. Many were children.   You refer to a review of \"An Eye for an Eye\" by the German critic Eike Geisel. Mr. Geisel wrote that I come from \"the school of sadistic sensationalism,\" and to prove it he quoted parts of the German edition of \"An Eye for an Eye.\" But neither I nor my German translator ever wrote what Mr. Geisel quoted. Incredibly, Mr. Geisel himself rewrote a part of the German edition to convey a sadistic sensationalism that he then attributed to me.   Many camp commandants in Poland (and nearly all the directors in Warsaw) were Jews, and Mr. Geisel wrote that my message is \"Jews equal Nazis,\" is Jewish and Nazi criminals are \"mirror images.\" That isn't my message at all.   I specifically write in \"An Eye for an Eye\" that the Jews and Nazis \"of course . . . hadn't done the same things at all,\" and that I would never contend that the Jews and the Germans \"were equivalent, even morally.\"   Instead, I write of Jews like Zlata, Moshe, Mania and Pola, who refused to look at, much less to work at, the Polish camps. I write of Jews like Shlomo Singer, who at the risk of his life told people who tortured the Germans, \"You must stop doing this,\" and of Jews like Lola Potok, a commandant, who at first took revenge on the Germans but then, at the risk of her life, protected them, even smuggled them food.    At the end of \"An Eye for an Eye,\" I write, \"I do believe it's a story of Jewish redemption.\"   Again incredibly, Mr. Geisel isn't a right-wing but left-wing critic, though surely the German right wing is now parroting him and saying that Jews equal Nazis. It is tragic that \"An Eye for an Eye\" is not being published in Germany now and that Germans have nowhere to learn the truth.

Some tough-smart-hip-attractive woman, played by somebody like Lauren Bacall or Emma Thompson, falls in with a tough-smart-hip-attractive man, played by somebody like Humphrey Bogart or Sean Connery. Fate throws them together in an extreme situation like a war or a jungle research project. Inevitably she is younger and less experienced, but -- in the eyes of the crusty misogynist at her side -- her biggest handicap is that she is a woman.   She is plucky, smart, vulnerable yet competent. At some point, in a moment of extreme duress when even Bogart-Connery has reached his limits -- the Nazis have them pinned down, the food has run out, the volcano is erupting, the ship is about to sink -- she comes up with an idea that pulls them through.

Newspapers in France and in Britain reported today that a senior intelligence officer in the Algerian Army was shot to death with two bodyguards and his driver on Sunday in an Algiers suburb. There was no official confirmation of the killing, but he would be the highest-ranking officer to be slain by militants since a military-backed coup set off an Islamic revolt there three years ago.   Islamic militants have also taken responsibility for blowing up three vital bridges in and around Algiers and killing at least 11 well-known figures in the arts and civil affairs in the last week. Among them were the director of the national theater; a composer of rai, an Arab music with a fast beat; and a leader of the feminist movement.   So far the oil industry, crucial to the country's flagging economy, has been spared. But diplomats and experts on Algerian affairs say the security situation seems to be spinning out of control, raising the prospect of an all-out guerrilla war involving big armed clashes across the country, including the capital.   European governments -- particularly that of France, which as Algeria's former colonial ruler has a large population of North Africans -- are expressing nervousness and confusion over the rapid deterioration in security. France's President, Francois Mitterrand, urged the Government this month to negotiate with the help of European mediators, but the Algerian leadership rebuffed that notion as outside interference in its affairs.   Diplomats say the ouster of Algeria's military-dominated Government could profoundly undermine the Governments of neighboring Morocco and Tunisia, leaving Europe to face a phalanx of Islamic states just across the Mediterranean modeled politically after Iran.    Europeans also fear the possibility of an influx of frightened middle-class North African migrants averse to the idea of living under Islamic rule.   Underlining those worries, Algerian militants carried out a virtually unparalleled raid on a border post in neighboring Tunisia last week, killing seven guards. The Armed Islamic Group, one of the most violent of the Algerian factions, took responsibility for that attack today.   In tracts distributed in Algiers, the group said the cross-border raid was a \"warning\" to Tunisia's staunchly secular Government to \"stop helping the enemies of Islam.\"   The violent revolt in Algeria began in early 1992, after a military-backed Government seized power and canceled a final round of elections that the Islamic movement seemed sure of winning. The new leadership banned the Islamic political movement and imposed severe limits on civil freedoms like public gatherings and writings critical of the Government.   Since then, clashes between secularists and Islamic militants have taken at least 30,000 lives, with security officers, Government officials, foreigners and, now, secular cultural figures among the main targets.   But the death toll last week, which began to surface in Algerian newspaper reports only today, represents a striking acceleration of the attacks.    French and Algerian analysts said the number killed last week exceeded 500 people, including militants, soldiers, urban civilians and Berbers in the mountainous Kabyl region in the north, where opposition to the fundamentalist campaign is strong.   The latest spate of large-scale attacks in the capital began with a suicide bombing on Jan. 30 near a police headquarters downtown that killed 42 people and wounded 256, mostly innocent civilians and pedestrians.   Often it takes several days to piece together events in Algeria. Few foreign journalists operate there because of the threat to their safety, and the Algerian Government often withholds information on rebel attacks and military operations.   The senior military officer reported killed on Sunday was Col. Mrawi Jilali, a ranking army intelligence officer responsible for issuing reports to the public and news organizations. According to several Algerian officials, he was one of the closest aides to the intelligence division's chief, Gen. Tewfik Madani, whose movements are a closely guarded secret.   The killing suggested that the fundamentalists are refining their sources of information and their infiltration of circles of the country's top leadership. Opposition figures said Colonel Jilali was under surveillance for three days before the shooting in the Kouba district, on the edge of the capital.   In December, Islamic militants took their war to France, hijacking an Air France jetliner from Algiers to Marseilles and killing three passengers before French commandos stormed the plane and killed the hijackers.    For the French Government, the most alarming aspect of the hijacking may be that intelligence officials now suspect that Iran helped instigate it .   In an article this week in the French weekly Paris Match, a former journalist and novelist, Gerard de Villiers, reports that French intelligence officials are saying that Iran has linked up with Islamic militants in Algeria \"on an operational level,\" lending advice and support.   Mr. de Villiers quotes French anti-terrorist intelligence officials as saying that early in December, weeks before the Christmas Eve hijacking began, Iran's minister of secret and intelligence services, Ali Fallahian, met with representatives of the Islamic Armed Group, the Palestinian organization Hamas and the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon known as the Party of God. All three groups are militantly Islamic in their orientation and receive advice and financial backing from Iran.   Mr. de Villiers wrote that French intelligence agents were tipped off about the meeting, which took place in Tripoli, Lebanon, by Syrian counterparts who watch Lebanon carefully.    Until recently, French intelligence believed that Algerian militants received some training in Iran and in the Sudan and some financial support. But the meeting in Lebanon appears to have taken relations to a higher level.   Last month, France's confusion over what to do about Algeria was evident. President Mitterrand's call for talks between militants and the army to end the conflict broke with a French policy of supporting the Algerian Government in its effort to eradicate militants. Mr. Mitterrand was immediately contradicted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who said the war was an internal Algerian affair.   Nonetheless, the attacks on vital targets in Algiers have shaken confidence among French officials that the Algerian military can still control the situation in the country of 30 million, where unemployment runs close to 40 percent. The economic misery helps the militants' drive to recruit volunteers to overthrow the Government.   Among the three vital bridges blown up in and around the capital in the last two days was one linking a neighborhood where the army headquarters and main armed forces hospital are located.   Any lingering hopes that the Government might renew a bid for negotiations with jailed leaders of the Islamic opposition have faded somewhat with reports in a London-based daily that the movement's leader, Abassi Madani, who was moved from house arrest to a military jail this month, has undergone an operation to remove a serious cancerous growth from his gums or jaw. The Algerian Government has not confirmed the report, which appeared in the Arabic-language paper Asharq Al Awsat.   Mr. Madani was moved from house arrest to a military jail earlier this month. It is not clear under what conditions he has been held following the surgery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/nyregion/news-summary-901195.html","abstract":"  International A2-9  AGREEMENT ON MEXICAN AID  The United States and Mexico agreed on a $20 billion rescue plan for Mexico.

The woman, Vanessa White, had called the police Monday afternoon, demanding urgent medical help for her child, Tynisha, who she said was \"unresponsive\" after taking a bath.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"Vote Panel Cites Mayor Of Newark","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/nyregion/vote-panel-cites-mayor-of-newark.html","abstract":"  Already under scrutiny by Federal prosecutors, Mayor Sharpe James today was accused of repeatedly violating state election laws by turning a storefront charity that he founded into an arm of his political machine that raised and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.   Although the 27-count complaint carries no criminal penalties, it represents the first official action against Mr. James since he and the municipal government were hit with a barrage of subpoenas in the summer. The charges appear to provide a glimpse of the activities that the United States Attorney is also investigating.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"Quiet Virtues of a Longtime Pianist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/arts/music-review-quiet-virtues-of-a-longtime-pianist.html","abstract":"  Grant Johannesen, the distinguished American pianist who first played in New York City 50 years ago, began the second half of his Carnegie Hall recital on Saturday night with Franck's \"Prelude, Chorale and Fugue.\" It was the second occasion this once ubiquitous, now fairly uncommon Franck piece had been heard in Carnegie this year; Yevgeny Kissin played it a few weeks ago.   These two pianists make an interesting pair: the one a young musician eager to make an old tradition his own; the other a figure with a direct link to the late-19th-century world through his studies with Egon Petri, the star pupil of Busoni. In technical terms, Mr. Johannesen could not compete with his younger colleague. He has trouble producing a full sound, and his technique is no longer flawless. His rendition of the Franck sounded muted and fragile in comparison with Mr. Kissin's gorgeous surge of tone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"State Universities Reshaped In the Era of Budget Cutting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/us/state-universities-reshaped-in-the-era-of-budget-cutting.html","abstract":"  With the nation's new emphasis on cutting taxes and curbing government spending, governors and legislatures are reducing the budgets of state university systems and, in the process, forcing the most radical reshaping of public higher education since its rapid growth in the 1960's.   Universities are raising tuition and cutting staff, as they did in 1992 and 1993 because of deep, recession-driven budget cuts, but this time they are also reducing the requirements for a degree, closing entire departments and adding financial penalties for students taking courses beyond those needed for graduation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950222","headline":"Playful Puppetry, for Adults Only","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/movies/film-review-playful-puppetry-for-adults-only.html","abstract":"  The well-named Feebles are a raunchy troupe of show-biz puppets able to ooze, drool, sniff, retch and copulate in ways that would make the Muppets blush. Sprung from the febrile imagination of Peter Jackson, they run seriously amok in \"Meet the Feebles,\" a 1989 film padded out to feature length and destined to stand as an unfortunate footnote to Mr. Jackson's career.   Mr. Jackson is best known as the director of \"Heavenly Creatures,\" which has bizarre, elaborate fantasy sequences animated by the same overwrought playfulness that is seen here. But in \"Heavenly Creatures,\" with its tale of a murder committed by two love-struck, delusional teen-agers, Mr. Jackson found the ballast to give his wildly fanciful outbursts a somber tinge. \"Meet the Feebles,\" which opens today at the Film Forum, has an overload of aimless giddiness without anything to keep it in check. Had Mr. Jackson not already used up the title \"Bad Taste\" on an earlier film, it would have fit \"Meet the Feebles\" well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19950222","headline":"The Corona reconnaissance satellite program, in existence from 1959 to 1972, is declassified.","pages":[{"title":"CORONA (satellite)","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORONA_(satellite)","description":"American reconnaissance satellites (1959–1972)","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Fairchild_C-119J_Flying_Boxcar_recovers_CORONA_Capsule_1960_USAF_040314-O-9999R-001.jpg/320px-Fairchild_C-119J_Flying_Boxcar_recovers_CORONA_Capsule_1960_USAF_040314-O-9999R-001.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":248},"abstract":"The CORONA program was a series of American strategic reconnaissance satellites produced and operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Directorate of Science & Technology with substantial assistance from the U.S. Air Force.
