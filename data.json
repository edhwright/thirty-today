It hunches alongside the cold gray surf of the Irish Sea about 25 miles north of Liverpool, at about the same latitude as Edmonton, Alberta, which means that beachgoers often wear windbreakers in August.  The European Union says the water is too dirty for swimming and, at the height of the summer season, the beaches are sometimes deserted, except for the men in woolly hats who are always there, offering rides to children on the shaggy donkeys that plod listlessly up and down the sand.   Yet for all that, this windswept curve of northern coastline endures as Britain's single most popular resort destination, a giddy tumble of neon, beachfront bed-and-breakfasts and Victorian odds and ends that this year is expected to draw an estimated seven to eight million happy holiday-makers, weekend revelers and conventioneers. Jostling among the heavy crowds along the seaside promenade or packed into the turn-of-the-century electric trams that still rattle along the beachfront, the basic Blackpool tourist is British, and probably from the north of England. There are families with children in tow, pensioners wobbling on and off tour buses, young adults hovering outside throbbing discos nearly as big as Madison Square Garden.

No imperial bearing, no thunderous pronouncements, no seat of central authority in a highly visible setting -- he occupies a small office in Milwaukee County Stadium -- no attempt to insert his supposed office to solve serious issues, or, at least, the impending strike by major league baseball players.

Music without plots and cast lists is easier to deal with. Think of instrumental music as sound without morals. The key of B flat doesn't lie, cheat or steal; it's just there. When music starts incorporating people, how they behave becomes an issue. Operas, for example, tell stories about how good or bad their characters are. Because goodness and badness vary wildly, depending on who is proclaiming the first or denying the second, every opera needs a reference point to tell the two apart. That point, I think, can reside only in the composer. The idea of good for Berlioz, even when applied to an opera about ancient Troy, is an idea of good mutually understood by him and his fellow Frenchmen in the 1850's.   Music by itself has qualities that push opera toward simpler outlines. The singing styles exaggerate speech; musical movement becomes a brake when applied to swiftly flowing words. Along with this size and slowness comes a simplification of human emotions; gray areas between good and bad tend to be erased. I saw a new opera based on \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" a few years ago in which Albert, Lotte's betrothed, is transformed into Werther's vicious rival, very unlike the sympathetic companion Goethe had made him. The composer, bowing evidently to opera's demands for symmetry, felt he needed unequivocal conflict, and Albert was his man. It is another example of opera's devouring good literature and being able to thrive on bad.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"Cinda I.

In the late 40's, when Stalinist apparatchiks purged the Polish Communist Party of its wartime leaders for fear they might follow the path of Tito in Yugoslavia, Dobrowolski was accused of spying, and was imprisoned and tortured. Freed by Wladislaw Gomulka in 1954, he was rehabilitated and made deputy editor of a Warsaw newspaper. But by the time of Dobrowolski's death, brought on by his treatment in prison, Stalinists had filtered back into the party's apparatus. So, at his funeral, comrades and enemies, people who had left the party and people who had expelled them, torturers and their victims, stood about his coffin shoulder to shoulder. \"Straight out of Shakespeare, eh?\" commented the friend who drove Mr. Kott home afterward.\n\n Mr. Kott had already begun the book that would make him famous, \"Shakespeare Our Contemporary,\" inspired by a 1956 \"Hamlet\" in Cracow, in which Hamlet's disillusioned rage clearly owed more to the rottenness in the state of Poland than that in Demark. But he offers Dobrowolski's funeral as a classic demonstration of the case his book made: that Shakespeare is the greatest dramatist of the 20th century, the supreme portrayer of the kinds of voilence, terror and bad faith that have characterized our time. His new volume, \"Still Alive,\" now translated by Jadwiga Kosicka, is not so much the story of his life -- its Polish title was \"Footnote to the Biography\" -- as a cluster of essay-memoirs about the European education that led him to recognize that he and his Polish generation inhabited the midnight universe of Richard III, Macbeth and King Lear.\n\n It was in Paris in 1939, as a 24-year-old student of French literature, that he first gained an inkling that his destiny was to live like the heroes of Andre Malraux: at the crossroads of history. Andre Breton and Tristan Tzara had tempted him with the other worldly visions of surrealism, Jacques Maritain with those of Thomist Catholicism, and for a month or two he was almost seduced by the peace of a Dominican cloister, where Maritain had sent him to cool his racing brain.\n\n But back in Paris he found himself playing boules with the man who in a year would murder Leon Trotsky, and a week or so later he met the woman, Lidia Steinhaus, who became his wife. A daughter of a famous Lvov family of Jewish intellectuals, she undid all the precautions Mr. Kott's father, an assimilated Jew, had taken at his birth, baptizing him a Christian and leaving him uncircumcised. From Sept. 1, 1939, when Hitler invaded Poland during their honeymoon, both Kotts were in constant danger from his bloodhounds of the Final Solution.\n\n As Mr. Kott says, he must be the only Shakespeare scholar to have lived out the plot devices of that farfetched comedy \"Measure for Measure.\" When Warsaw capitulated in 1939, he was saved from deportation to a German prison camp by a Jewish doctor who cured him of pneumonia and handed him over to his family by the only legal means possible -- accompanying his boy with a death certificate. Four years later, having fallen into the hands of the advancing Russians while wearing a German railwayman's greatcoat stolen during the Warsaw uprising, he was saved from hanging by getting drunk, like Shakespeare's rougue Barnardine, on the pure alcohol given him as his last drink on earth. In the old belief that a criminal should face his death sober, the Russians let him sleep off his jag, after which he was able to explain himself and prove his party membership.\n\n Much of the zest of \"Shakespeare Our Contemporary\" came from Mr. Kott's familiarity with life-and-death Shakespearian situations in the Warsaw underground, among the partisans who took to the forests, and during the postwar purges of the party in which he put his faith. His book was a marvelous teaching instrument for exiting bored students about a dramatist four centuries dead. At the same time, it was irritating, with its insistence on contemporary relevance as the only theatrical virtue that mattered. Mr. Kott's Shakespeare was racier but narrower than the original, and attracted thinly modish minds. For 20 years, it was almost impossible to see a Shakespeare play in Europe whose goodies didn't wear jeans and whose baddies didn't wear double-breasted suits.\n\n The real message of the book -- looked at again after 30 years -- seems to have been that all drama during the cold war was necessarily polarized between its mighty opposites, as the art of the Middle Ages was polarized between heaven and hell. There's no arguing with that; it gave us 40 years of electric theater. Glacing down the roster of plays in Paris, London and New York these days, it's hard to see anywhere to go for a sense of being plugged into history. Only John Guare's \"Six Degrees of Separation\" shows an inkling of how the world may polarize itself in the century approaching.\n\n No wonder Mr. Kott says he finds little interest in theater nowadays. If fact, the playwright whom \"Still Alive\" calls to mind is not Shakespeare but Mr. Kott's actual contemporary and countryman, Tadeusz Kantor. In Kantor's play \"The Dead Class,\" a generation of Poles reassemble in the classroom where they first knew one another, a few living, most of them dead. Mr. Kott's book is his \"Dead Class,\" a wall of memory, its early chapters swarming like those of \"Gone With the Wind\" with vivid, brilliant young men and beautiful, passionate women whose names you know intuitively you needn't remember -- they will be sept away by the firestorm gathering over Europe. In his last chapters, musing on his five heart attacks, Mr. Kott recalls these people again, and tells how some of them died. Obviously he is ready for the reunion of his class of 1939.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"Votes in Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/nyregion/votes-in-congress-883700.html","abstract":"  Tally Last Week in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York  Senate   1.

Even Boomer Esiason, technically intercepted twice in the debut of the Jets' new 49er-style offense, brushed off worrying about a sputtering attack.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"Votech That Works","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/education/votech-that-works.html","abstract":"  Every year, vocational education students at Lancaster County schools in Pennsylvania take classroom training in carpentry, plumbing, electrical wiring and masonry and build several houses priced in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.    This showcases the students for local builders, who inspect the work and have usually hired all of them by the time classes end in June. But more importantly, the process of building the houses, under the watchful eye of an experienced builder, gives them a taste of what it is like to work for a living.    The program is part of a broad effort, driven to a large degree by the economic and industrial needs of the nation, to strengthen the work force, improve the quality of vocational training in high schools, develop specialized training after high school for those who do not go on to college, and offer some hands-on training for engineering and science students who do go on.   As matters stand, a gap has widened between what traditional vocational training offers and what workers in high-technology industry need. \"Students are often not prepared for work,\" said Richard C. Burley, director of the three-school vocational technical program in south-central Pennsylvania. \"So we try to put students in the atmosphere they will face when they leave.\"    One fact that makes the Lancaster program of double interest is that it guarantees its students jobs if they successfully complete their programs. \"We've been guaranteeing jobs for five years, \" Mr. Burley said. \"We say that if a student comes to school 95 percent of the time, maintains a C average or better and graduates, we guarantee a job in their specialty or they can come to school for free until we find a job for them.\" He said a few had come back for a few months, but were eventually placed. Graduates Often Lacked Basic Skills    This intensely practical approach evolved after employers complained that high school graduates in America often lacked basic verbal and mathematics skills, let alone the specialized knowledge needed to operate complicated, computer-controlled machines and instruments. This has been an important theme for the Clinton Administration, which has proposed developing improved national standards for secondary education and launched a program to link up students with prospective employers before graduation.    One reason for the Administration's interest is the growing international economic competition. \"The United States is unique among industrial countries in that it does not have an organized postsecondary education system for the noncollege-bound,\" said Lester Thurow, a prominent economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Countries like Germany and Japan use their edcucation systems as competitive weapons, Mr. Thurow said, with the Japanese talking about training workers to 'add to effective battle strength.\"'    Education specialist and business groups say there are jobs available for people without four-year college degrees, but increasingly they require specialized training. \"I've got jobs I can't fill,\" Mr. Burley said. \"They include diesel mechanics, computer repair, welders, machinists, electricians, masons and refrigeration.\"    But even where the demand for technically trained people is apparent, vocational programs still struggle against the notion that a four-year college education is the only proper goal for students other than those with the most limited ability. Indeed, specialists in the vocational education field say that the practices of almost automatic promotion and grade inflation have left employers largely distrustful of the value of a high school diploma. As a result, after graduation many of the non-college-bound \"Flounder in the job market for six or eight years while they mature,\" said Alfred Pautler, a professor of education at the State University of New York at Buffalo. \"Finally at about the age of 26 to 28 they begin to get real jobs.\"    One of the goals of the Administration's education initiative is to help change employer attitudes toward the noncollege-bound by setting national standards for vocational education.    Part of the problem for the noncollege-bound, Professor Pautler said, is that most secondary schools send their graduates into the unknown without a mechanism to assist them in the next phase of their lives. \"If a child goes from high school to college, that is a successful handoff,\" he said. \"But others have nowhere to go, and the schools do not track them. Most districts do not know where their graduates go.\"   To help provide hands-on skills, the Lancaster vocational schools are also offering some courses for the college-bound. On certain mornings during the school year, pre-engineering students come to the vocational schools to experiment in a laboratory for computer-aided design. \"These are kids who are going to four-year engineering schools,\" Mr. Burley said. \"We bring them in here and familiarize them with top-of-the-line C.A.D. equipment.\" The students design simple products on the C.A.D. terminals and then transfer the designs to computer-controlled cutting machines. \"They watch the part they designed get manufactured,\" Mr. Burley said. \"That gets the good academic student interested.\" It is also useful for them, since even top-ranked engineering schools are requiring students to participate in projects where they design and build real products. Increasing Complexity of Jobs    A recent report by the American Society for Training and Development predicts that both industrial and service jobs will grow increasingly complex and technically demanding. The report, \"Quality Education: School Reform for the New American Economy,\" said the result would be that people with postsecondary education would tend to supplant those with only high school diplomas.    Like many other vocational schools, Lancaster County's have relationships with community colleges in the area, where graduates can go on to get a two-year associate's degree, which is valuable in many technical fields. Today's work force is like an hourglass that is being pulled apart, Mr. Burley said. \"It is being separated into the skilled and nonskilled. The skilled jobs pay salaries and benefits that can support a family. About all an unskilled person can do is work two jobs and go without benefits.\"    There are, of course, limits even to greatly improved vocational education. All workers are simply not trainable for work on the high-tech equipment of today's workplace. But with improved specialized training in high school and with the encouragement to continue on in some noncollege training afterward, many can move into the skilled world. They and the nation as a whole will be the beneficiaries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"A Museum That Brings the Outdoors In","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/travel/a-museum-that-brings-the-outdoors-in.html","abstract":"WHEN I emerged from the new Pacific Northwest Museum of Natural History in Ashland, Ore., a computer printout in my hand informed me that I had done quite well interacting with the exhibits.

No punk rock band has ever matched the jagged, acerbic fury of the riffs Williams played 35 years ago. No rapper has approached his ability to evoke the torment of life in prison or bend language to cast an eerie spell over a chance encounter with a seductive woman. Williams could improvise precise, topical blues numbers with remarkable spontaneity. He had never been recorded when he was discovered in Angola penitentiary in Louisiana, convicted of murder. Like the country blues titan Leadbelly, Williams even sang his way to freedom.   Yet he was no more than a moderate success on the folk-revival circuit in the 1960's, and the very density and originality of his blues must have been part of the reason. His decision to take up the slide guitar was also ill-advised. Today he is a shadowy memory, unknown outside blues circles. The release of Williams's prison recordings in 1959 caused a sensation with an earlier generation of fans. By rights, equal excitement should greet the recent reissue of most of his earliest sides along with more than a dozen unreleased tunes on \"I'm as Blue as a Man Can Be\" (Arhoolie 394; CD and cassette) and \"When a Man Takes the Blues\" (Arhoolie 395, CD and cassette).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"Serb Defiance Continues","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/world/serb-defiance-continues.html","abstract":"  Bosnian Serbs continued their violations of the security zone around Sarajevo, firing mortar shells despite a NATO air strike.

But if the first generation of their buildings is any indication, Asia has been more helpful to architects' balance sheets than to their reputations. Most work by American architects in Japan turns out to look pretty much like their work back home, only more so. It is as if they saw their commissions more as advertising than as design opportunities.    Frank Gehry, for example -- as potent a creative force as exists in American architecture -- built a restaurant in Kobe partly in the shape of a fish, his favorite form. The Kobe fish, whose metal-scaled tail shoots up three or four stories, isn't much more than a spectacular sign. It's fun, but it hardly pushes Mr. Gehry's work forward: it's more a caricature of Gehry architecture than an exemplar of it. The rest of the building (which houses an American-style restaurant called the Fish Dance) is ordinary, even dull.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"City Investigators Question Giuliani Fund-Raiser","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/nyregion/city-investigators-question-giuliani-fund-raiser.html","abstract":"  William W.

In his sophomore and junior years he was absent more days than he was in school, spending his time roaming around town with friends, playing soccer or working odd jobs.\n\n But this year, the 17-year-old did not skip a single class. In fact, he was the first to arrive for his science lab every day. With his coat still on he worried over things he never knew about before, such as growing fragile bacteria cells in a petri dish or testing the acidity of his solutions.\n\n The promise of a good job is what finally hooked Roberto into being interested in school. He and 24 other students are part of a two-year program at Berkeley High School called the Biotech Academy. In a special course, integrated with other math and science classes, students learn manufacturing skills in demand by biotechnology companies today -- sterilizing, growing cells, testing air and water quality. This summer, Roberto and other students will have a chance to use those skills at paid internships at biotechnology companies in the area. And if the students complete two years of community college after high school, they will be considered for jobs with starting salaries as high as $30,000.\n\n Typically, public school curriculum is targeted to the college-bound students who are already driven and have goals. But not much is done for students like Roberto who get caught in a cycle of playing hooky, getting into trouble, falling behind and eventually dropping out. To help them, programs like Berkeley High's Biotech Academy are becoming increasingly popular around the country, according to Norton Grubb, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley. The program links classes to the prospect of jobs in an industry that is growing, while it also increase academic demands on students with harder math, science and language arts programs.\n\n \"It is an attempt,\" said Professor Grubb, \"to seriously develop an education for all kids.\"\n\n What makes Berkeley's program different is that it was created not by educators but by people in biotechnology. In the late 1980's Miles Inc., a Pittsburgh-based health care, chemical and imaging company and one of Berkeley's largest employers, wanted to expand its biotechnology plant in West Berkeley and also attract workers for planned manufacturing jobs as a result of the expansion.\n\n Some residents opposed the expansion because of concerns of the effect on the community from traffic as well as fears about biotechnology accidents. To make the development agreement more attractive to the city, Miles offered to set up Berkeley Biotechnology Education Inc., a nonprofit organization to train low-income city residents in biotechnology jobs to be run by a board of city officials, educators and people in the biotechnology industry. Miles financed the organization with $1.7 million to pay for the teachers, equipment and summer interships, and $300,000 more for science education for younger students. Miles committed itself to hiring 80 percent of its future lab and production technicians from the program.\n\n At the same time, 96 local bioscience companies reported having difficulty keeping entry-level workers in manufacturing jobs, according to the Bay Area Bioscience Center, a nonprofit organziation tracking biotechnology, pharmaceutical research and production. Companies either could not find people to fill positions or they would hire college graduates who would go on to better positions quickly, according to a 1993 report done by the Bioscience Center.\n\n William R. Srigley, vice president of production an engineer at Miles, said his company had a vested interest in the program's success. \"This is not 100 percent altruism at all,\" Mr. Srigley said. \"We need people to work here. The more we can hire locally, the less money it costs. If you look at every hire as having the potential of being a good employee, you can reduce the risks by influencing the educational process early.\"\nGeared to Industry's Needs\n\n The academy is different from traditional education in many ways. Its board designed the curriculum with an eye to what the industry needs. For example, in most biology classes bacterial growth may be a five-minute side lesson. In the Biotech Academy, students spend weeks trying to grow bacteria cells in a petri dish, counting the cells and mathematically working out how much could be in a concentration. They do this over and over until they get it right.\n\n Amy Hansen, one of the teachers, talks about the working world all the time. If students are late, they get a lecture about what bosses would think about tardiness. When she senses interest waning, she reminds them why they are here: \"It's your job to keep these puppies alive, so you better know how to use a pH meter.\" And she told the class one day: \"It's a mess here. It looks like an army has been through. Your co-workers will not like it.\"\n\n Ms. Hansen, who also teaches the upper-level chemistry and biology classes at the school, said she was surprised at how easily these students were motivated. At the Biotech Academy, to encourage students it is the policy that they cannot earn less than a B grade unless they are consistently tardy or do not come to class. Ms. Hansen waits until every student understands a lab task before moving on. \"The student leaves this program with the sense that if they stick with things they'll be successful,\" she said. \n\nA few students are not doing well and come to class only sporadically, Ms. Hansen said. But for the majority the academy has had some positive effect on their lives. Tamasha Cunningham, 17, says she used to skip school often and hurry home to intercept mail to her parents reporting her absences. She had planned to drop out of school this year and work full time at a fast-food restaurant, but then she heard about the biotechnology program and the amount of money she could earn if she joined. Now she only comes to school for the Biotech Academy and is earning the rest of her high school degree through a local college's correspondence course. \n\nTamasha makes clear that she has no interest in school and is only participating in the biotechnology program because she sees that she can earn more money in the imminent future through the Academy than she could at the restaurant. She met a woman who works at Miles, who invited her to her home. \"She has a nice, nice house and she has no boyfriend helping her pay the rent,\" Tamasha said. \"That's the thing for me, financial independence.\" \n\nFor Victor Rios, the program is a chance to have a direction after years of trouble. The 16-year-old had a D-plus grade point average last year. He has worked since he was 13, he said, at a flea market, selling newspapers and then stealing cars until he was caught last year.\n\nHis car-theft conviction scared Victor, who was involved in a gang at the time, he says. Another science teacher, recognizing he was intelligent, recommended that he join the Biotech Academy. Now Victor, who still struggles to make it to class, is the one who barrages guest speakers with ethical questions about biotechnology. He is excited that next year the class will be experimenting with DNA. \n\nVictor wishes he had the grades to go to a four-year college. The program gives him options, he says, but he is concerned about its limitations. \"What we're preparing to be are the dishwashers of the future,\" says Victor, who also works as a bus boy at a local restaurant. \"Other kids will go to a college and in four years will come in and be the supervisors.\"\n\nRoberto Hernandez knows the Biotech Academy will not lead to a doctorate in chemistry. But he says he dreams of becoming a scientist who discovers cures for afflictions such as arthritis, which his mother has. \n\nHis father, a janitor, looks worn down and tired to him. Roberto washes dishes to help his family, but he does not want to do that for the rest of his life. A quiet student with slicked-back hair, he has just completed his senior year with perfect attendance and with a reputation for raising his hand whenever he did not understand what was happening in class.\n\nHe goes to class, he says, because \"every day, the Biotech Academy teaches me something I'll need to know at work.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"HOME CLINIC;\nAchieving That Pleasingly Antique Look on Those Old Pieces","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/nyregion/home-clinic-achieving-that-pleasingly-antique-look-on-those-old.html","abstract":"IN decorating circles antiquing is euphemistically referred to as giving furniture an Old World finish.

Similar acts, in other parts of the world, have been inspired by what is too sweepingly called Islamic fundamentalism. Every great religion derives its strength from fundamentals, and in that sense every believer is a fundamentalist.

His paints were slippery. His brushwork was slippery. His paintings seemed to elide into one another. And he called himself a \"slipping glimpser.\" Of his predilection for slippery paints (he was known to mix his pigments with safflower oil), Mr. de Kooning said, \"I like a nice, juicy, greasy surface.\" The oil extended the usual drying time, allowing him to work his paintings over and over. Even when a painting was done (or at least gone), bits and pieces of it would crop up in later paintings, because Mr. de Kooning -- as Richard Shiff, a professor of art history at the University of Texas, Austin, points out -- made tracings, photographs and oil transfers of certain passages in his paintings, creating a \"yogurt,\" a culture from which he could generate new works. However, despite Mr. de Kooning's tenacity, his seven decades of work (a lucid chronology by Marla Prather, an associate curator of 20th-century art at the National Gallery of Art, covers the years 1938 to 1986) show several transformations: the somber clay-colored portraits of the 30's gave way to the urban-inspired abstractions of the 40's, then to the bug-eyed, buck-toothed women of the 50's, then to the pastoral Long Island abstractions and the more comical bug-eyed women of the 60's, and finally to the wispy ribbons of the 70's and 80's that trail, sadly, into no painting at all. (Mr. de Kooning, who is 90 years old, is no longer painting.) Though the artist has his themes, shuttling back and forth between women and landscapes, between figures and abstractions, there is always change and always slipping. \"When I'm falling,\" he said to the English art historian David Sylvester in 1960, \"I am doing all right. And when I am slipping I say, 'Hey, this is very interesting.' . . . That is a wonderful sensation . . . to slip into this glimpse.\" As you can see from this sensuous book, Mr. de Kooning was quite right: it is wonderful slipping into this glimpse.

Dail.\n378 pp. New York: A Thomas Dunne Book/St. Martin's Press. $22.95\n\n The \"four hands\" in the title of Paco Ignacio Taibo 2d's novel belong to his characters Greg Simon and Julio Fernandez, a team of freelance journalists who cover an international, mostly Latin American beat. Writing with four hands and in two languages for the world's left-leaning press, they are journalists of the old romantic, revolutionary kind, a la John Reed. But their human foibles reflect the fallen world they live in: they are unlucky in love, engagingly neurotic and inclined to bicker like an old married couple. In their physical appearance (the Mexican Julio is fat, the American Greg is slight), their hapless personal lives and their secret devotion to each other, they resemble no one so much as Laurel and Hardy -- of whose films, incidentally, Julio is a passionate devotee.\n\n Greg and Julio tell fragments of their story (set in the late 1980's) against a narrative that rambles agreeably across decades and continents, assembling as it goes a collection of very odd characters, who enter in various ways into the great political dramas of the 209th century (including Stan Laurel himself, who, during a boozy sojourn south of the border, witnesses Pancho Villa's murder). Octogenarian veterans of the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War, Mexican drug traffickers, Nicaraguan revolutionaries, C.I.A. flunkies -- their lives are evoked in astonishing detail. As the novel progresses, these lives come together; they all become entangled in a nasty C.I.A. scheme to discredit the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua by implicating one of its heroes in a staged murder and a phony drug racket.\n\n Despite its intricate plotting, \"Four Hands,\" now translated by Laura C. Dail, is not exactly a taut political thriller. Perhaps because Mr. Taibo is a historian and journalist (as well as a best-selling novelist in Mexico), the novel seems to contain the contents of a couple of messy file drawers assembled by an intellectual with a love for humanity, popular culture, good jokes and the romantic history of the left. Those who don't mind rummaging rather than racing through a novel will enjoy the digressive chapters about Houdini's psychiatric sessions (with Greg's grandfather as the shrink), the reimagined fragments of one of Emilio Salgari's \"Tigers of Malaysia\" adverture yarns and the working drafts of a lost novel by Leon Trotsky written in his Mexico period. This is a novel you want to put down -- to go to the library and look things up. Deciding when Mr. Taibo is pulling your leg is one of the amusing challenges of reading it.\n\n When it comes to making its political points, however, \"Four Hands\" is deadly serious. In Alex, the C.I.A. spook who has constructed the anti-Sandinista plot (\"Operation Snow White\"), Mr. Taibo creates a loathsome, chilling and (unfortunately) plausible figure. The operatives whom Alex gathers (with approriate Disneyesque code names) to bring \"Snow White\" to fruition are evil in their professional detachment from the reality of what they do. The novel offers an indictment of American foreign policy at its seamiest, and undoubedly will be hard to take for American readers with warm memories of the Reagan-Bush era and clear consciences about the historical role of the United States in this hemisphere.\n\n But, as one of the novel's old Spanish Civil War veterans observes, C.I.A. spooks are just the most recent generation of \"them\" -- that is, \"the legion of demons who, for the last 70 years, had been on the other side of the barricade.\" In Mr. Taibo's novel, good and evil transcend nationality: some of the most sympathetic and beautifully drawn of his characters are Americans. There is Max Lewis, a sad and sensitive veteran of the International Brigades; the young Benjamin Linder, a martyr to the Sandinista cause; and, especially, the sardonic and thoroughly decent Greg. They share more than their political leanings with the novel's other good guys: they are wary innocents in a world that has wounded or sidelined them, but not taken away their capacity for wistful love.\n\n That love crosses linguistic and national frontiers and binds together the novel's many pairs of friends. Stan Laurel meets and befriends Julio's grandsfather, an old Spanish leftist, in a forgotten Baja California town; the only language they share is the universal one of sympathy. A pair of veterans of the International Brigades emerge from senescent obscurity to take up the good fight in a new time and place, and to renew a friendship forged half a century earlier in wartime Spain. In the novel within the novel, two old Tigers of Malaysia (A Malaysian and a Portuguese) swashbuckle together across Asian seas in defiance of European imperalists.\n\n Above all, the friendship of Greg and Julio radiates with a rough and happy affection. Their cross-cultural teasing reflects a mutual tolerance of human frailty, and their four-handed journalism comes straight from a single mind and heart; the two men are one in their abhorrence of injustice and their passion for the truth. For all of its undisciplined sprawl, its pop culture sensibilities and its tone of disenchantment, Mr. Taibo's novel soars, in its best moments, with conviction, fraternal love and the old-fashion lyrical idealism of lost leftist causes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"Advocates Speaking Up for Library Money","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/nyregion/advocates-speaking-up-for-library-money.html","abstract":"A CITIZENS force is mobilizing in the county to help bolster dwindling budgets provided for library services.\n\n\"We are organizing now because working informally hasn't really worked,\" said Joan C.

In overbooking -- accepting more ticket reservations than there are seats -- if all expedients fail, a passenger who arrives at the gate on time with a ticket and seat assignment does not board and thus misses a meeting, connection, vacation or wedding. The Government rules specify monetary compensation -- $200 or $400 depending on the fare and the degree of lateness at the destination -- to a bumped passenger, who in any case may refuse it and negotiate for more, or sue.   Government data show a rise in the rate of involuntary bumping in the first quarter of 1994, both over the last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1993. In addition, the 1993 total was greater than 1992's, although the trend over 10 years has been downward: from 4.34 bumped passengers per 10,000 in 1984 to 1 per 10,000 in 1993. The figure for the first quarter of 1994 is 1.52. A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation saw no reason for this rise.  Gambling on No-Shows    Overbooking is a universal airline practice. The Department of Transportation says all popular flights are \"routinely\" overbooked by 20 percent or more. This way, airlines play poker against no-shows, including, for example, people who make reservations on several flights because they do not know when a meeting will end.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940807","headline":"'Mr. All-Good' of France, Battling English, Meets Defeat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/world/mr-all-good-of-france-battling-english-meets-defeat.html","abstract":"  Confident that history was on his side, Culture Minister Jacques Toubon braved mockery and abuse this spring when he promoted a law requiring that 3,000 English words widely used in France be replaced by newly created French equivalents.

The central question is whether any mitigating circumstance protects the defendant from execution, as is provided under the Connecticut law.\n\nSupporters of the death penalty cite the Ross case as further evidence that the present law, characterized as the narrowest in the nation, is unworkable: that in reality no executions are possible under its stringent provisions.

A friend of the new regime proposed that the heavenly weather was symbolic of a more-than-meteorological clearing of the air at Tanglewood, the end of a long 12-tone reign by Northeastern academic composers.   An exaggeration, of course: Tanglewood was host to a wide range of contemporary programming under Oliver Knussen's direction over the last seven years, and the 12-toners will be back in a concert on Monday. But there certainly were some new and unexpected sounds floating out of the new Seiji Ozawa Hall on Saturday afternoon.

Singers, and for that matter instrumentalists, want to do big pieces in recital, and so an orchestra is boiled down to grand-piano size. When the process reverses, as it did at Friday evening's Mostly Mozart concert in Avery Fisher Hall, listeners may stop and wonder. Hermann Prey singing Schubert with Gerard Schwarz's Festival Orchestra gave them a chance to do just that.   Enlargement of musical means may or may not enlarge the experience of beauty, but it almost certainly alters it. Indeed, changing the character of Schubert's piano originals comes close to creating another song. Even when the orchestrators are Liszt, Webern, Britten or Felix Mottl, such transactions become a little slippery. The potential to warp and mislead is at least as great as the ability to enhance and instruct.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940808","headline":"It's Another Jam Session on L. I.

Mr. Farmer makes an audience concentrate to hear his story, and each of his phrases hinted at a previous idea, or added shadows to a melody he was about to play.

Millions of sea anemones and shrimp live atop the mound, contradicting the old view of the ocean floor as a biological desert.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940809","headline":"Proposed Rail Link to Airports Ignores Needs of New Yorkers; Take the F Train","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/09/opinion/l-proposed-rail-link-to-airports-ignores-needs-of-new-yorkers-take-the-f-train-901920.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The airport rail link (news article, July 27) is not needed.

Indeed, his latest underachievement has been to tie for fourth-to-seventh places with Artur Yusupov, Aleksei Dreyev and Viktor Korchnoi with 4 1/2 points at the Dortmund International Tournament in Germany in late July. Top honors went to Jeroen Piket of the Netherlands, first with 6 1/2 points, Michael Adams of England, second with 5 1/2 points, and Vladimir Yepishin, third with 5 points.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940809","headline":"When Privacy Hurts : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/09/opinion/IHT-when-privacy-hurts-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Privacy laws, strict laws regulating physician-patient confidentiality, were cited to dissuade my husband and me from searching out the physician or clinic that diagnosed colon cancer in the case of our son.

Unfortunately, the kind of megachoir heard most often in New York City of late, with young groups from several states pulled together (more or less) in a day or two of rehearsal, has cast the medium in a dubious light. Seeing a stageful of voices, a listener has come to expect vague pitch, mushy rhythm and muddy harmonies.   So it is good to be reminded by the Berkshire Choral Festival what a veteran conductor can accomplish with a contingent of experienced, committed choristers in a concentrated week of rehearsal. This evening, Vance George, well remembered from his days at the University of Wisconsin and now the director of the San Francisco Symphony Chorus, conducted 200 voices and the Springfield Symphony Orchestra in fine performances of Haydn's \"Harmoniemesse\" and Durufle's Requiem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940809","headline":"Police Link 2-Boat Crash To Defects","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/09/nyregion/police-link-2-boat-crash-to-defects.html","abstract":"  Suffolk County authorities said today that mechanical failure was the likeliest cause of a collision between two boats on the Great South Bay on Sunday evening that left two people dead and another seriously injured.
