Carroll & Graf. $18.95.   Although Beryl Bainbridge's novels and short stories all share certain recognizable themes and motifs -- characters disappointed in love and life, a preoccupation with violent and alarming deaths, a mood of weariness and menace -- they have ranged all over the map in subject matter. \"The Secret Glass\" (1974) portrayed a postwar romance between a young Lancashire girl and an American soldier. \"Young Adolf\" (1979) depicted a visit by the young Hitler to prewar England. \"Winter Garden\" ( 1981) chronicled the adventures of a group of artists invited to tour the Soviet Union. And \"An Awfully Big Adventure\" (1991) conjured up the backstage antics of an amateur theater troupe in Liverpool.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940412","headline":"Women's Game Has Low Costs, No Checks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/sports/hockey-women-s-game-has-low-costs-no-checks.html","abstract":"  It is an upscale activity for college women, no cousin of mud wrestling and nothing like a slam-bang National Hockey League contest. Women's hockey has arrived.    Should the United States team win the third International Ice Hockey Federation's women's world championships that began last night at Lake Placid with the Americans routing Switzerland, 6-0, in a game that was not as close as the score, the impact would hardly be comparable to the United States men's team capturing the Olympic gold on the same rink 14 years ago.

At its testiest, the theater has aimed at the soul-warping nature of the film industry in corrosive satires that date back to Kaufman and Hart and continue with plays from Mamet and Shanley. Another line of attack, represented by the works produced by Cameron Mackintosh and the forthcoming Disney stage version of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" is the \"if you can't lick 'em, join 'em\" approach, in which plays are stocked with technological special effects that emulate the fun-house thrills of a Spielberg spectacle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940412","headline":"At Masters, a Wacky Course of Events","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/sports/golf-at-masters-a-wacky-course-of-events.html","abstract":"  When golfers in the 58th Masters arrived at the fourth tee Friday during the second round, some of them thought they were hallucinating.

Each troupe is different, colored by particulars of locale and personality.

Mr. Villella was the gutsy, firebrand star of the New York City Ballet in the 1960's and 70's. And so unsurprisingly enough, the Miami company is filled with young firebrand dancers, many of them from Latin America. It dances with a Hispanic verve.

He had already published a slightly noticed novella, but had to face the unwelcome news that his new book, about the aftermath of World War II in a ravaged Cologne, was hardly the sort of thing that could establish a fledgling literary reputation in 1950's Germany. His publisher refused to issue it, saying it wasn't good enough but meaning, it is now clear, that the subject matter was just too depressing and dark for the beaten and war-weary country to cope with.    The rejection almost caused Boll -- who had repeatedly been forced to stop work on \"The Silent Angel\" to churn out short stories to pay the rent and help support his three small sons -- to give up writing altogether. Instead, the author, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1972, ended up incorporating many of the themes and characters from \"The Silent Angel\" into subsequent works. The protagonist, Hans Schnitzler, is seen by Boll scholars as the precursor to Hans Schnier in Boll's 1963 novel \"The Clown.\" But Boll died in 1985 with \"The Silent Angel\" still unpublished.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940413","headline":"The House Tackles Crime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/opinion/the-house-tackles-crime.html","abstract":"  Now it is the House's turn to debate a crime bill that foolishly creates a slew of new Federal crimes and death penalties to display \"toughness\" but also extends a badly needed Federal hand -- and dollar -- to anxious states and localities for crime control programs.

Western countries value the individual above society; in Asia, he said, the good of society is deemed more important than individual liberties. This comfortable bit of sophistry helps governments from China to Indonesia rationalize abuses and marginalize courageous people who campaign for causes like due process and freedom from torture. Western nations, it is asserted, have no right to impose their values on countries that govern themselves successfully according to their own values.   So, the argument goes, when Americans express outrage over a punishment that causes permanent scarring -- in this case, caning -- they are committing an act of cultural arrogance, assuming that American values are intrinsically superior to those of another culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940413","headline":"Firefighter's Status Worse After Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/nyregion/firefighter-s-status-worse-after-surgery.html","abstract":"  Capt.

A nonmalignant version of the gene had been found before by biologists studying the normal mechanisms that control the cycle of cell growth and division.

She showed restraint in Act I, even seeming underpowered, signaling that she had her sometimes strident tone under control. A metallic upper edge suited Amneris's smoldering moods, and a successful stretch into the deep lower range (not so much chest tone as stomach tone) added another layer of menace. She made the character dramatically vivid, tracing grand gestures that fell comfortably short of melodrama.   Miss Dimitrova was the bright spot in a fairly bleak evening. Whatever dramatic momentum she incited ran up against the crushing dullness of Lando Bartolini's Radames. Mr. Bartolini presents the facsimile of a classic Italian tenor: tonal heft in all registers, a brilliant tessitura.

For the members of the Akazu, the ruling clan around the late President Juvenal Habyarimana, the only way to retain a 21-year monopoly on power was to kill their enemies as fast as they could. And until yesterday, when anti-Government rebels overran the capital of Kigali, that brutal clique was getting help from an unlikely quarter: France.   Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate until it gained independence in 1962, and until recently it got most of its military aid from Belgium. But Belgian law prohibits any lethal aid to a country at war. In 1975, two years after he seized power by deposing the President who had appointed him, Mr. Habyarimana signed a military cooperation agreement with France. When the rebel guerrillas of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (harbored and largely armed by neighboring Uganda) invaded in 1990 and again last year, it was France that rushed in combat troops, mortars and artillery to help the Government.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940414","headline":"Dallas Investor Wins Senate Nomination","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/14/us/dallas-investor-wins-senate-nomination.html","abstract":"  Richard W.
