The plan, announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, Russia and Spain after a brief meeting here, calls for the United States to use air power if necessary to protect United Nations peacekeepers guarding six Bosnian towns that have been designated \"safe havens\" by the United Nations Security Council. Issue Goes to Security Council    But the size and duties of the peacekeeping mission will have to be decided by the Security Council, and Mr. Christopher did not specify what American aircraft would be authorized to do. That means that no use of American military force is imminent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"BEST SELLERS: May 23, 1993","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/books/best-sellers-may-23-1993.html","abstract":"                   Weeks    This   Last   On    Week   Week   List   Fiction              1   1   41   THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, by Robert James Waller.

As they testified in a trial over whether Dr. Jeffries had been illegally removed from his post as chairman of the university's black studies department, the officials also made it obvious how little scrutiny they had given the department in 20 years.    When the jury sided with Dr. Jeffries, awarding him $400,000 in punitive damages last week, some jurors said the university did not make a convincing case about the shortcomings of Dr. Jeffries and his department. They decided that the only reason he had been removed from his post was to punish him for a speech he delivered in Albany in 1991. The speech caused a widespread outcry because of Dr. Jeffries's contentions, including his comments that Jews and the Mafia conspired to put down blacks in Hollywood films. No Clear Idea of Standards    The jury's verdict suggests a disturbing notion about those whose job it was to oversee Dr. Jeffries's department: that officials did not have a clear idea of what standards to use to judge its work and that of its faculty, and more importantly, they did not care enough to notice how it was changing or developing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"New Jersey Q & A: Miles Lerman;\nMaking a Holocaust Memorial a Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-miles-lerman-making-a-holocaust-memorial-a-reality.html","abstract":"ONE day in 1941, while he was in a Nazi labor camp near Lvov, his Polish birthplace, Miles Lerman witnessed an atrocity that still haunts him more than five decades later.

During the teens, 20's and 30's -- the golden age of the European poster -- a variety of English businesses, even the Government itself, employed some of the finest graphic designers and painters to promote products, services and ideas. This was not the hard sell we have come to expect from advertising agencies today; quite often the works were masterpieces of painterly form and typographic elegance. One corporation, Shell Oil, stood out for its inventiveness. THE SHELL POSTER BOOK (Godine, paper, $19.95), a collection of the company's finest posters from 1920 to 1952, shows that good design was good business. The company's poster tradition can be credited to one employee, Jack Beddington, who, despite lack of experience, was placed in charge of advertising after he complained that the company's promotions were mundane. Under his leadership, Shell's ads were transformed from crass and copy-driven to elegant image-dominated posters with catchy phrases. Styles ranged from the rectilinear Art Moderne renderings depicting speed by Tom Purvis, to modern country landscapes by Graham Sutherland, Paul Nash and Vanessa Bell, to the Surrealist fantasies of E. McKnight Kauffer and Zero (Hans Schleger). There were also frequent experiments with Cubist, Expressionist and cartoon styles by veteran and neophyte artists alike. By the early 50's the quality of the posters had begun to decline, a situation caused as much by the passing of the great artists as by changes in corporate priorities. As slick as later advertising became, however, it does not surpass the individuality and originality of the posters produced when Shell was fueled by art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Putney, Vt.;\nApartments For the Elderly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/realestate/northeast-notebook-putney-vt-apartments-for-the-elderly.html","abstract":"DEVELOPERS in this rural southeastern Vermont town of 2,352 people have created a 28-unit complex, Putney Meadows Elderly Housing, that will serve both the elderly and the handicapped of any age.

A few weeks later, Mr. Norris wrote back, saying he'd be happy to star in their movie. That was in 1983.

The one from Belize depicts the Queen in profile on the obverse and shows her reviewing the troops from horseback on the reverse. But others combine a British motif with a distincly un-British design.

Her living quarters were in the modern part of the house, and most off-season evenings were spent in the two 1730's parlors, so outrageously antique with their broad floorboards, dangerously low-beamed ceilings and oversized hearths in which blazed oversized fires that it was not difficult to be wafted back in time to that era of early New England. \n\nThus, by accident, I became acquainted with one of New England's greater assets: the multimuseumed museum called more often by its acronym S.P.N.E.A.

More often than not you read that a studio executive or someone close to a production \"spoke on the condition of anonymity.\" Because I speak to the press on the record, I expect to be quoted accurately in return. When James Greenberg contacted me about his article on Kit Culkin and his child-star son Macauley Culkin  [ \"A 'Stage Father' Flexes His New Muscles,\" April 25 ] , I told him I wasn't interested in \"Culkin-bashing.\" He assured me that that wasn't the intent of his article. Not!   My quotes were conveniently lopped off halfway through to meet the needs of Mr. Greenberg's article.  Some clarifications follow:   In the article I am quoted as saying, \"Mack has not changed, but Kit has -- absolutely.\" I had gone on to say that as a father and manager Kit has done whatever he feels is necessary to protect his child.   In regard to the notion that \"Mr. Culkin's methods may prove damaging to his son's career,\" I went on to say that he and his wife, Pat, must be doing something right because Mack and his siblings are the same great kids I met six years ago.   While preparing to direct the play \"Sam, I Am,\" I indeed \"recall being at the screaming end of Mr. Culkin's phone calls,\" but both the playwright and I were as disappointed as all the other artists involved when we canceled the production.   Minor points, you say? Yes. The shortened quote under the photograph of Mack may make for a splashy caption, but is no more accurate than the headlines we see in grocery-store tabloids. I thought The New York Times was above this type of journalism.   When the truth is twisted to engage more readers, what's the point in speaking the truth to begin with?

Yet for longtime Philharmonic watchers, the real celebration lay less in what was presented than in how. With Mr. Masur continuing to build fastidiously on his achievements of the previous season, his first as music director, the orchestra consistently played better -- with more spirit and refinement -- than it had in years, perhaps decades.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"A New Poll Describes Vacation Preferences","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/travel/a-new-poll-describes-vacation-preferences.html","abstract":"  DOROTHY MATARAS has recurrent dreams about China, her fantasy vacation spot.   \"It fascinates me,\" said Mrs. Mataras, 52, of Liverpool, N.Y., near Syracuse. \"Anytime there's a movie about China, it's like deja vu.

This fact is amply demonstrated by the incandescent retrospective of LeWitt's wall drawings at the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. (through June 13). At the entrance to this 62-year-old neo-classical building, large isometric cubes in rich colors float on opposing walls; inside the six-sided foyer, two square walls pulse with banded geometries. But the real treat awaits upstairs, where seven beautifully proportioned rooms have been emptied of art objects to make way for 40 big wall drawings that trace LeWitt's often remarkable artistic journey from the late 1960's, when he was a pillar of the Conceptual Art movement, to the present.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Article 749493 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/realestate/article-749493-no-title.html","abstract":"  JUST about everybody knows that nothing is getting built in New York City.

It will feature great individual players like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Patrick Ewing. It will feature two teams that are coached superbly and have relentless defenses. And the drama will provide long-lasting memories. The Eastern Conference finals between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls has been anticipated and analyzed. But finally, starting with Game 1 this afternoon at Madison Square Garden, the plot will unfold. Many factors will determine the winner of the four-of-seven-game series. But as the matchup gets under way, here's a look at five areas that will greatly determine which team goes to the championship finals, and which team goes home.    1. THE JORDON FACTOR:    Jordan's greatness goes beyond his ability to score, to defend and to levitate.

Oddly tart and sweet at the same time, these anemic-looking yellow limes are a natural for souffles and sorbets.

Some chefs have gone a step further, experimenting with Key lime flavored seasonings, flours and pastas.\n\nThe pale yellow Key lime is smaller, rounder and juicier than its ubiquitous cousin, the oval, green Persian lime found in produce aisles the nation over. Aficionados favorably compare the Key lime's appealing zing with the mouth-puckering sourness of the Persian variety, a larger, hardier hybrid.  The Key lime is a temperamental species given to uneven growth spurts and sporadic fruit bearing, a few reasons commercial growers in Florida have all but thrown in the trowel.

That is not a comment I make lightly; neither is it a nod to Jefferson's 250th birthday last month, an event that deserves to be celebrated with honesty rather than hyperbole. It is merely an observation that comes from 25 years of looking at buildings in this country, and realizing how few of them reach the transcendent. Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater? Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building? Louis Kahn's Salk Institute? It is not a long list, and Jefferson's work heads it.   Jefferson's legacy has not always brought great architecture in its wake; it has intimidated more than it has inspired, though one newly completed addition to this campus offers tremendous promise. Surely of all of the truly great pieces of architecture in this country, the University of Virginia is the most American, the one that best embodies our tendency both to look back at other cultures and to try to make something that is entirely our own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"She Doesn't Sing the Blues Anymore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/she-doesnt-sing-the-blues-anymore.html","abstract":"WHEN Sun Meidia decided to resume her career as a jazz vocalist after 19 years away from show business, she took a direct approach.

Granted, it offers drama and special-effects possibilities, and when Rossini composed \"Mose in Egitto,\" in 1818, it was a way around prohibitions against presenting secular theater works in Naples during Lent. Still, the story lacks a strong-willed female character at the center of the conflict, a considerable operatic deficiency.   Cecil B. DeMille faced the same problem in making \"The Ten Commandments,\" and so manufactured a romance between Moses and Pharaoh's wife. Rossini's solution was similar, but the composer and his librettist, Andrea Leone Tottola, put the romance at arms length.

Almost all changes under consideration include a central role for what used to be known as the family doctor -- today generally an internist or family practitioner -- who can save the system money by taking care of a wide variety of ailments on his own and referring patients for more costly specialty care or tests only when absolutely necessary.  Once a Cornerstone    Although such primary-care doctors were once the cornerstone of American medicine, their numbers have dwindled as younger doctors have been drawn to specialty fields by money and the lure of new technology.

That mixture goes to the heart of Mr. Nelson's mystique. He exudes a knowledge that has been so thoroughly assimilated that to philosophize in anything but an understated tone would be hysterical.    From the mid-1970's through the mid-80's, Mr. Nelson was close to being the king of country music, although his sound has always stood starkly apart from the Nashville mainstream.

In the last 10 years, the Kurds have driven tens of thousands of Assyrians and Chaldeans into exile, and yet Western commentators persist in their naive belief that the Kurds are the only oppressed people in the region.   The Chaldeans and Assyrians, among the earliest converts to Christianity, have lived in the north of Iraq and southeast of Turkey for almost four millennia. They still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus.    At the beginning of the 1980's there were 25,000 Chaldean Christians living around Mardin in the predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey. Now there are only 200 or 300. Churches and monasteries in existence more than 1,000 years have been forced to close forever.   These people left because the Kurds told them they had no future in a land the Kurds would soon control. And with establishment of the so-called safe haven just across the border, the Chaldean and Assyrian Christians of northern Iraq have been driven to the same conclusion. Since the Persian Gulf war tens of thousands of them have fled, mostly to Turkey and Jordan.   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ankara pretends these Christian peoples have nothing to fear from the Kurds (who massacred them along with Armenians early in this century), from Saddam Hussein or from the rising tide of Islam. Western countries support this line, despite the hundreds who have died trying to enter the European Community illegally.   The protection zone in northern Iraq may save the Kurds, but it does nothing to help the large numbers of Christians still living there. Northern Iraq -- like the rest of that unhappy country -- is composed of minorities: Kurds, Turkomans, Yezidis, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and they all need Western protection. Mr. Safire is absolutely right to demand that the West should do more than it is doing, but without linking this aid to safeguards for all these peoples, the West will simply be facilitating in Northern Iraq the ethnic cleansing it condemns in Bosnia.

What I actually did was hook up a brain-dead boy to life support, drill a hole in his head and try to comfort his hysterical mom while I negotiated him into our last remaining intensive care unit bed.   Judge Knapp doesn't seem to understand that the consumption of illegal drugs, not the commerce surrounding them, causes most of the drug-related misery and death. This tragedy is visited not only upon the drug users, but also upon those who get in the way of their fists, knives, guns and cars.

The novelty has worn off the fact that Living Colour, four black musicians, play heavy metal, an overwhelmingly white genre.

Although it is set to music by an Italian composer, this piece has often reminded dancegoers of the works of August Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer who is celebrated for the speed and lightness of his steps. The movements Balanchine devised for \"Donizetti Variations\" are equally airy, and the piece received a buoyant performance by a cast in which the male star was the Danish-born Nikolaj Hubbe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930525","headline":"SCIENTIST AT WORK: Solomon Snyder; Brain Researcher Makes It Look Easy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/25/science/scientist-at-work-solomon-snyder-brain-researcher-makes-it-look-easy.html","abstract":"  Dr. Solomon Snyder, the soft-spoken director of the department of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, slouches on the sofa in his inner office and speaks of the great passions of his life.

Wilson of Harvard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930525","headline":"4 Israeli Soldiers Die as Squads Fire on Each Other","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/25/world/4-israeli-soldiers-die-as-squads-fire-on-each-other.html","abstract":"  In the most serious mishap of its kind suffered by the Israeli Army in years, four soldiers were killed today when two Israeli paratrooper squads fired on each other in the so-called security zone that Israel maintains in southern Lebanon.   It was not clear what ignited the predawn shootout, in which three other soldiers were wounded, two seriously.

The rejection was delivered to President Clinton's special adviser for Haitian affairs, Lawrence Pezzullo, and the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo. It came after American diplomats expressed strong confidence in recent days that army leaders would accept the return of the country's elected President, the Rev.

But new statistics for the early 1990's show that the countryside, at least for the moment, is holding its own again.   From one rural county to another, the changes documented by Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at Loyola University-Chicago, and Calvin Beale, a demographer at the Department of Agriculture in Washington, are slight but consistent. While only 47 percent of all rural counties in the United States gained population in the 1980's, two-thirds gained population from the spring of 1990, when the 1990 census was completed, to the spring of 1991.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930525","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/25/nyregion/c-corrections-108693.html","abstract":"  An article on May 17 about the increasing number of black, Hispanic and Asian converts to Judaism misidentified the branch chosen by most converts.
