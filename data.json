McDowell is a 20-game winner for the second successive season, Fernandez blossomed into an 18-game winner and the youngest pair, Alvarez and Bere, have been hotter than the other two in the past seven weeks, winning 14 and losing none of their last 15 starts combined.   All four are power pitchers, with Bere, a 22-year-old rookie, registering the best strikeout ratio. Bere was a 36th- round draft pick in 1990, and was not a starter in his first minor league season. He has developed rapidly, compiling a 2.19 e.r.a. since the all-star break.   The development of Bere and Alvarez have relegated Tim Belcher and Kirk McCaskill, two veteran starters, to relief roles.   Roberto Hernandez has been an effective closing relief pitcher, gaining 38 saves in 43 chances. In the field As much as they like to run, the Blue Jays have to be wary of Ron Karkovice, who has thrown out 48 of 96 would-be basestealers.   \"You can never steal on Karkovice,\" Sparky Anderson, the Detroit manager, said. \"The only chance you have is if a pitcher allows you a chance and the White Sox usually don't allow you a chance. McDowell is the only one you can take a chance on. Karkovice is the best receiver in either league.\"   The catcher is the first cog in the smooth defense the White Sox boast up the middle. Shortstop Ozzie Guillen and second baseman Joey Cora form a good double-play combination and provide good coverage in the middle of the infield. Lance Johnson covers a lot of ground in center field.   Robin Ventura is one of the best defensive third basemen in the league. Frank Thomas, the regular first baseman, very likely will be the d.h. His replacement, Dan Pasqua is better defensively. At the plate The series could come down to one simple development: Will Frank Thomas have a healthy left arm to swing at Toronto pitches, or will he continue to have the problem that plagued him in his final couple of weeks? Thomas injured his left triceps trying to catch a foul ball Sept. 19 and slumped badly afterward. Sitting out five games before playing Sunday, the big first baseman hit no home runs in his last 15 games and drove in two runs in his last 11.   If he is healthy and hitting like the player who batted .316, socked 41 home runs and knocked in 128 runs, the Blue Jays won't let him hit. That is, they most likely will pitch around him.   \"For me, I wouldn't let Frank Thomas get close to a fastball,\" said the general manager of an American League team not in the playoff. \"Walk him. The Blue Jays' pitchers have to pitch around him. You can't let Thomas beat you.\"   If the Blue Jays employ that strategy, Robin Ventura (22 home runs, 93 r.b.i.) becomes the key run producer. If Thomas is the d.h. George Bell or Bo Jackson won't be. But neither has hit against Toronto this season (Bell .065, Jackson .048, so that may not be much of a loss). Tim Raines, the leadoff batter, and Lance Johnson are .300 hitters. Off the bench Manager Gene Lamont probably will use his bench more than the Blue Jays, but probably not much more. He has spelled Tim Raines in left with Bo Jackson, and he has started Dan Pasqua in right for Ellis Burks. Craig Grebeck also gets an occasional infield start.   George Bell, if he is not the designated hitter; Jackson, Pasqua, Warren Newson and Ivan Calderon could hit for someone if the situation calls for it. Steve Sax is the invisible man. Blue Jays: On the mound The pitcher who should have been the Blue Jays' best this season pitched in New York instead. They let Jimmy Key leave as a free agent, and their starting rotation suffered.   Dave Stewart, a veteran of 14 post-season starts with Oakland, has received the assignment of leading the staff, not just because of his experience but because of his recent run of effective pitching. After struggling to an 8-8 record, he reeled off four consecutive victories.   Juan Guzman (14-3) hasn't lost since July 20. He has won 7 of his 13 starts since, and the Blue Jays have won three others. Pat Hentgen, in his first year in the starting rotation, was the team's No. 1 winner with a 19-9 record but, like the other starters, had a high earned run average, 3.87. Guzman finished at 3.99, Stewart at 4.44 and Todd Stottlemyre (the staff enigma with an 11-12 record) at 4.84.   Jack Morris can't pitch because of a torn elbow ligament, but he couldn't have helped, based on his 7-12, 6.19 e.r.a.   Duane Ward, with 45 saves, has done as well as Tom Henke, his predecessor, ever did as the closer, but no one stepped in to take Ward's spot as as the setup reliever to the closer. In the field Pat Borders is no Ron Karkovice--he's borderline, a general manager said, jokingly or otherwise--but the Blue Jays' pitchers do a better job than most holding runners on. The rest of the defense doesn't have to apologize to anyone.   Roberto Alomar is as good a second baseman as there is, and Devon White has the same standing among center fielders Rickey Henderson, snatch catch and all, catches everything on the left field side of center that White doesn't get. In other words, the Blue Jays are well covered on grass (Comiskey Park) and on artificial turf (SkyDome).   Tony Fernandez, who revived after the Mets traded him back to Toronto, doesn't have the range at shortstop he did in his first seven years with the Blue Jays, but he gets around well enough. Ed Sprague, in his first year as the third baseman, can be vulnerable, having committed 17 errors this season. At the plate To beat the Blue Jays, Sparky Anderson says, the White Sox must stop Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor. \"They don't have to stop the other guys,\" Anderson said. \"If Henderson and Molitor have good series, they're going to make monsters out of the others. You have to contain them, and I haven't seen anyone contain Molitor all season.\"   Molitor, who replaced Dave Winfield, he of the World Series-winning hit, outdid Winfield during the season, batting .332, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 111 runs. During one late-season month, Aug. 15 to Sept. 15, the designated hitter batted .405 and knocked in 27 runs in 28 games.   Henderson, on the other hand, batted only .216 after joining Toronto, highly uncharacteristic for a player who always has played extremely well upon going to a new team. \"This is national attention for him,\" Anderson said. \"I'm scared of guys who respond to national attention and he does.\"   The \"other guys\" Anderson refered to include Roberto Alomar (.323), Joe Carter (33 homers, 120 r.b.i.) and John Olerud, whose .402 average of July 31 dropped to .363 because he batted only .290 since then. Not to be overlooked are Devon White (.272), Tony Fernandez (.304) and Ed Sprague (73 r.b.i.). Off the bench With the lineup he has, Manager Cito Gaston doesn't have much need for a bench. Who would he hit for? That's why the Blue Jays don't need the kind of pinch-hitters they used to have, people like Pat Tabler and Rance Mulliniks.   Turner Ward was the team's busiest pinch-hitter during the season, and he batted six times. No one had more than one hit as a pinch-hittter. Nor does Gaston have any need to substitute defensively. What the Blue Jays show at the start of a game is pretty much what they'll still be showing at the end.

With the 34-year-old Taylor, the Giants find themselves in a difficult position. On one hand, they want to both respect and honor the dignity of a warrior who would try and play if every bone in his body was broken. On the other, they want to make plays and win games, going with the idea that younger players like Corey Miller and Jessie Armstead are better than an aging veteran who is ailing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931005","headline":"Assessing the Harm In Ocean Dumping","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/05/opinion/l-assessing-the-harm-in-ocean-dumping-210993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Carol M.

Many of these \"exotic\" plants spread so easily that along with native weeds, which account for 5 to 10 percent of species, their physical extent is proportionally greater than their species numbers.

Her sari costume was unavailable, so she put on a black leotard and practice skirt with a colored scarf tied at her waist. \"I have a whole library of scarves,\" she said gaily in her colorfully accented English. \"I should open a store.\" Haunted by a Certain Swan    Someone handed her a tin mixing bowl that was close to the shape she would hold in performance. Then she began to move, watched intently by Peggy Lyman, a former Graham dancer who performed the solo in 1985. What emerged was not St. Denis, Graham or Miss Lyman, but a figure of mysterious passion and simplicity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931005","headline":"Justices Turn Down Bail for One Officer In Rodney King Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/05/us/justices-turn-down-bail-for-one-officer-in-rodney-king-case.html","abstract":"  A police officer convicted of beating Rodney G.

In the 1970's, he had what seemed a tremendous stroke of luck: a job on the hit television series \"The Jeffersons,\" playing the son, Lionel. His three seasons in the employ of Norman Lear handily took care of his music-school tuition. But he soon discovered that thanks to his television work, American opera companies did not take him seriously. Now living in England, Mr. Evans has found work mainly in countries where \"The Jeffersons\" is unknown.   Snobbishness is not the only obstacle Mr. Evans faces. He regularly runs into what he called in a telephone interview \"the historically documented resistance to black men in classical music.\" American opera companies offer him minimum weekly contracts, pegged to particular roles like Sportin' Life in \"Porgy and Bess.\" But he says there is still a general reluctance to engage black male singers for the long term. In 1989 he turned down an offer from the Metropolitan Opera because it was connected only to the Gershwin opera. \"I am a total package,\" he said, adding, \"I am not going to belittle myself or swallow my self-esteem.\" Mutual Suggestions    When Mr. Evans went to England for the Glyndebourne Festival production of \"Porgy,\" the one taped by PBS, he encountered no such problems. Simon Rattle, the conductor, engaged him as Sportin' Life, then offered him other opportunities, starting with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The singer also found the working atmosphere to be more comfortable and constructive. \"After the first dress rehearsal, Simon had notes for us, suggestions on things we could do differently, and we had notes for him,\" Mr. Evans said. \"He accepted them with humility.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931005","headline":"Court Upholds Fine In Mammogram Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/05/nyregion/court-upholds-fine-in-mammogram-case.html","abstract":"  A New York State Supreme Court Judge has upheld a $170,000 fine against a Long Island doctor who provided 225 patients with questionable mammograms, the Nassau County Health Department announced this evening.

They want Congress to back $1 billion in Government loan guarantees, subsidizing arms makers who market their wares to foreigners on credit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931006","headline":"Lighting a Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/06/sports/IHT-lighting-a-fire.html","abstract":"Soccer's saving grace is that, at a time when its ethics are more suspect than those of Watergate, along comes a performance to remind us that this was a game long before it became a business. .Naive?

According to the comprehensive, yearlong research project, the arts and other cultural activities have grown substantially in importance over the last decade. They now pump at least $9.8 billion a year into the New York metropolitan area and, directly and indirectly, support more than 107,000 jobs. The arts directly employ some 41,000, appreciably more than the 36,000 employed in advertising.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931006","headline":"Program Announced For '93 Tucker Concert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/06/arts/program-announced-for-93-tucker-concert.html","abstract":"  Renee Fleming, Florence Quivar, Ruth Ann Swenson, Richard Leech, Thomas Hampson, Samuel Ramey and James Morris are to sing at this year's Richard Tucker Music Foundation Gala Concert, Dec. 12 at 7 P.M. at Avery Fisher Hall.

The rotation gave the revolution the club staged over the second half in the N.L. West its momentum. It's deep and often unmerciful, paid multi-millions to allow as close to nothing as possible. The team's collective e.r.a. of 3.14 wasted the rest of the competition in the N.L. Greg Maddux should win his second straight Cy Young Award, Tom Glavine won 20 games for the third straight season and Steve Avery has the most sinister stuff of all of them. John Smoltz, the man with all the pitches and all too often the habit of wasting a great part of his talent, is a post-season deity in Atlanta. He seems to find his zone when the October moonlight finds him on the mound. Avery split his season record against the Phillies, his e.r.a. a full half a point higher versus Philadelphia than it was for the season. He will also be facing the club's right-handed lineup, certainly its more lethal incarnation. Maddux simply is the best pitcher in baseball at the moment. He walks no one, gives up a hit every five innings or so and always takes his club deep into games. Glavine, who has a mixed post-season resume at best, may enter the scene with the most to personally prove. The bullpen, as almost virtually all in baseball are, is ordinary. Mark Wohlers throws hard, but straight, and so is turning around a lot on the mound. Kent Mercker never seems to throw strikes when he has to. Steve Bedrosian and Jay Howell have been effective surprises. But the Braves have not won the World Series the last two seasons because they never seemed able to get the final out. Greg McMichael, barely invited to spring training, gets the invitation to make history for the Braves as the club's closer. But the right-hander, whose out pitches are not strikes, has been awfully suspect after a summer-long run of fantasy finishes. The Phillies, who have faced McMichael six tmes in 1993, stuck him with an 8.53 e.r.a. At Least They're Healthy Conventional wisdom says the Phillies are at the wrong end of a mismatch in this department. As usual, there's considerable truth to standard thinking. The club's starters, a revelation over the first half, were often wounded and worked over across the team's uneven trek to October's promised land. Tommy Greene has been hurt, and Terry Mulholland was once feared done for the season. All are now available and certainly capable. They may have to be much more. Their track record, though, says the corps, one augmented Danny Jackson's left-handed presence, will give the Phillies innings, keep them close enough for there to be hope that the offensive engine will wear down the opposition. Certainly, turning the games over to the bullpen will be a mortifying option. The contingent of relievers, one the front office sought all season to improve and alter, was ranked 11th in the N.L. They together amassed 24 blown saves. The Phillies, not surprisingly, were a marginal 23-20 in one-run games. Mitch Williams, the theoretical closer, is the perfect top man for a below average bullpen. His final pitching line of the season about captured the perpetually potential downside to his dramatics: 1 IP, 1 hit, 2 runs, 2 walks, 2 wild pitches. Advantage Braves IN THE FIELD Sometimes Vulnerable You don't win three straight division titles without a line of defense, and the fielding fortifications for the Braves got more imposing when McGriff was added. His bat gets people's attention and headlines and it might have got him more than a handful of MVP votes (McGriff's arrival sparked the inflation of everyone's averageinfalted the averages of his cohorts at the chop shop, but his play aty first might get the Braves an extra out or two when it counts most this series. But Atlanta, whose overall fielding efforts ranked third in the N.L., isn't without its departments of defense that trouble Manager Bobby Cox. Terry Pendleton, garnerer of Gold Gloves, has been erratic this season at third. Ron Gant, for all his speed and hustle, still can seem unrefined three years after his conversion to an outfielder. David Justice can launch the odd throw that looks more like one of his home runs. And the defense's vulnerability was on full and painful display over the season's final stretch. Freddy Krueger With a Glove It can be Nightmare on Broad Street when the Phillies slip into their slapstick routine in the field. It can happen anytime with this club, and there won't be a worse time than if the Phillies don't make the routine and remarkable plays in October that win championships. Dave Hollins is the first baseman of the future, only he now plays third base in the present. He doesn't do it soundly. John Kruk, the man who does play first, hasn't of late played it nearly as efficiently and airtightly as he had earlier in the season. The club turned the fewest number of double plays of any club in the N.L. in 1993. It also made 141 errors, their defense finding its rightfully mediocre place in the second tier of the league (9th place.) Pete Incaviglia, the man with the World's Gym upper body and world's worst set of wheels, can be an adventure in left. Lenny Dykstra still runs into walls in cnter, but doesn't pick himself up with the ball in his glove quite as often. Advantage Braves. AT THE PLATE Well-Balanced and Hot \"There are good lineups at the plate - Texas, San Francisco, Philadelphia,\" said Ron Gant, the left-fielder for the Braves. \"None are hot like we are hot.\" The temperature turned out these numbers - Atlanta's 169 homers led the N.L. and Gant, David Justice and Fred McGriff all hit 30 or more homers and drove in 100 or more runs. It's a lineup blessed with fabulous balance - Otis Nixon's basehit bunts and afterburners (his 47 stolen bases were good enough for 3rd in N.L.), Jeff Blauser's hit parade out of the No. 2 hole (182 for a shortstop), Terry Pendleton's decision to go nuts with the bat the last week of the season (the third baseman drove in nine over the final weekend), and Mark Lemke's repeated flair for post-season mass production. The lineup had a perfectly healthy appetitite for the strong-arm offerings of the Phillies, as Justice, Pendleton and McGriff combined to hit .333, with Justice homering three times. Gant, though, could be the wild card. With right-handers Tommy Greene and Curt Schilling coming at the Braves in Game 1 and Game 2, Gant, who hit only .191 against the Phillies, will be under the microscope to see if the breakthrough in the clutch he made throughout the second half of 1993 extends to the second season. They Score in Bunches The club nearly scored 900 runs in 1993, a staggering total that wasn't hurt by the 5.3 runs a game the club scored on average in its 12 games with the Braves. Len Dykstra, who might have been the runaway choice for N.L. MVP in the absence of Barry Bonds, is a machine of offensive menace, on base always and across the plate more than any other player in baseball this season. He's a lifetime .312 hitter against Atlanta. The heart of the order is as patient and muscular as they come - John Kruk (.430 on-base percentage, .316 average), Darren Daulton (105 r.b.i., 117 walks) and Dave Hollins (.330 against left-handers.) And the attack - Philadelphia's club average of .274 trailed only the Giants - has been aided by assorted phenomena - Pete Incaviglia drove in an astonishing 89 runs in only 368 at-bats (the left-fielder hit four homers against Atlanta pitching) and and Kevin Stocker, a minor-league promotion halfway through the season, hit .324 in 70 games. Key questions would involve how fast Daulton's bat still is (the catcher played in 147 games), how a lack of team speed might hurt the club in a short series (the Phillies were next to last in the N.L. in stolen bases), and the ability of players with great numbers but inconclusive track records (Mariano Duncan, Jim Eisenreich) to produce in the passion of post-season. Advantage Phillies. OFF THE BENCH Not Glamorous, But Solid Sid Bream, Rafael Belliard, Bill Pecota. They aren't glamorous names, but they are the estimable backbone of the bench for the Braves. They'll provide professional defense and the occasional quality at bat in a big spot. And the dugout isn't devoid entirely of intriguing mercenaries. Deion Sanders can steal a base and make an impact if asked to start. And Francisco Cabrera, whose 15 minutes of fame might have been among the most intense in baseball history hit .357 with a homer and three r.b.i. against the Phillies this year. Which Ones Are They? It's hard to separate the bench from the regulars. Jim Eisenreich hit .318 as the right-fielder against right-handers and Milt Thompson drove in 44 runs as the left-fielder against right-handers. Pete Incaviglia wreaked havoc against lefties and Wes Chamberlain hit 12 homers and 20 doubles in under 300 at-bats. The bench is deep beyond the platoon, too. Todd Pratt 87 as the backup catcher and pinch-hitter. Rickey Jordan who can homer on half-swings, hit .289. And Kim Batiste can fill the role of home-run threat. Advantage Phillies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931006","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/06/nyregion/c-corrections-617793.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a \"Political Memo\" article on Sunday, about the political effects of the Mollen Commission's investigation of police corruption, referred incorrectly to the aftermath of televised comments by Eric Adams, head of an organization of black police officers.

It will be very hard for the Mayor to hold the narrow lead over his Republican challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, that he has in some polls. But the tightness of the contest has produced some transparently ugly politics.   Dinkins surrogates have used bigoted statements to rally the black vote; the Rev. William Jones's comment about \"fascist\" elements in the Giuliani campaign is an example. The Mayor's tepid disavowals opened him to the accusation that these statements were coordinated with his campaign. It is not enough for the Mayor to say mildly that \"I do not agree with every statement made by every supporter.\" As Mayor and candidate, he has been too given to tardiness and half-measures.

Giuliani, dressed in red plaid jacket and discreet gold earrings, facing camera in office setting with warm wood-toned television cabinet in background. At one point, footage is interspersed of Mr. Giuliani in a hard hat and plaid workshirt, talking first with a white construction worker and then a black one at a building site. As she says her final lines, Ms. Giuliani first nods, then shakes her head just a bit. PRODUCER: The Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT: As a journalist, I thought I'd seen everything. I was wrong. I'm Donna, Rudy Giuliani's wife. My husband was called a fascist by a group of ministers endorsing David Dinkins. And while people who support the Mayor are called proud, people who support my husband are called racist. This election shouldn't be about race, it should be about competence. Of course I want people to vote for Rudy Giuliani. But I want them to vote for Rudy because he's the best man for the job, not for any other reason. ACCURACY: In endorsing the Mayor last week, the Rev. William H. Jones, the head of a black Baptist ministers group, said Mr. Dinkins had been unfairly branded a murderer in the death of a Hasidic scholar in Crown Heights and that people who made such charges included fascist \"elements\" that has grown around Mr. Giuliani. But he did not call Mr. Giuliani a fascist. While some Dinkins supporters have said that some white Democrats are backing Mr. Giuliani largely because of his race, Mr. Dinkins has never explicitly ascribed racial motives to them. The Mayor often says that for blacks to vote for a black or Italians to vote for an Italian is an expression of pride, while voting against someone because of his origin constitutes racism. SCORECARD: Mr. Giuliani often contends that Mr. Dinkins is too willing to paint himself as a victim of racial animosities, and this commercial, and a similar one by Mr. Giuliani's running mate for Comptroller, Herman Badillo, argues that Mr. Giuliani is the true victim -- of guilty liberal voters reluctant to oppose a black candidate. Without saying so, it objects that few politicians or pundits find it troubling that more than 90 percent of black voters back Mr. Dinkins, while often bemoaning the fact that barely one quarter of whites support the Mayor. That amounts to a call to arms to Mr. Giuliani's strongest white ethnic backers to support him with pride, and to white liberals to be offended by appeals to guilt and focus on competence instead. It trades on Ms. Giuliani's reputation as a former news anchorwoman for WPIX-TV to make its case in a Checkers meets Diane Sawyer vein, and sorrowful tone as she stands by her man puts a soft edge on a tough message. But the ad also risks seeming disengenuous: While ostensibly saying that race should not be an issue, it actually goes to great lengths to highlight and trade on racially inflammatory remarks.

Max Morath, sometimes as a singer but more prominently as ragtime pianist, has been similarly subversive at the keyboard. The three came together on Sunday afternoon in the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College. Benefiting was the Institute for Studies in American Music at Brooklyn College. Cited was H. Wiley Hitchcock, its founding director, who is retiring. And noted, too, was the Bolcom and Morris anniversary: The team's first concert, in 1973, was under the auspices of the institute.   Musical values have been so influenced by ideas and progress -- in other words, by the politics of style -- that the American popular song is by and large the recipient of affectionate pats and subsequent dismissal from serious scrutiny. Its harmonic language has not kept pace with the Schoenbergs of 20th-century music and, at its most sophisticated, goes very little past turn-of-the-century Ravel. The June-moon-croon school of lyrics sounds somehow more legitimate in Schumann's German than in 1920's Americanese.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931007","headline":"Tests Added for Women in Health Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/us/clinton-s-health-plan-tests-added-for-women-in-health-plan.html","abstract":"  Responding to complaints from women's advocates, the Clinton Administration announced today that its health plan would pay for more frequent mammograms than it had originally recommended.   Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, told the Senate Labor Committee that in addition to free mammograms every two years for women over the age of 50, the Administration had decided it wanted additional breast X-rays for women in high-risk categories, like those with a family history of breast cancer, to be fully paid by the program. Worried About Bureaucracy    When it gets the Administration's final proposal, Congress is expected to alter many details, and more liberal benefits for women's health concerns are politically inviting to many lawmakers. Last week, 36 women in the House urged Hillary Rodham Clinton to see that more generous standards were adopted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931007","headline":"Review/Dance; Folklore Right in Step With the Abstract","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/arts/review-dance-folklore-right-in-step-with-the-abstract.html","abstract":"  Aman World Music and Dance opened an engagement at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night with a program that featured venerable folk dances as well as the world premiere of Laura Dean's \"Light,\" an up-to-the-minute piece that nonetheless has roots in the past.   It may at first seem odd that this Los Angeles-based troupe of dancers, singers and musicians turned to Ms. Dean. Aman, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, specializes in folk dances from around the world performed in traditional costumes and accompanied by traditional instruments. Ms. Dean is a rigorous abstractionist who has worked with both ballet and modern-dance companies. Her love of patterning has led some theatergoers to call her a minimalist, although that designation in no way does justice to the intricacy and beauty of her choreography.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931007","headline":"Briton Insists He'll Push for Democracy in Hong Kong","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/world/briton-insists-he-ll-push-for-democracy-in-hong-kong.html","abstract":"  The Governor of Hong Kong said today that his yearlong effort had failed to win approval from China for his plan to expand democractic rule before Britain withdraws from the colony in 1997, and that he would proceed with the plan despite Chinese threats.

The small increase wouldn't be very important -- except for the fact that last year's experience is part of a disturbing story that's been unfolding for a decade or more. The proportion of Americans living in poverty -- for a family of four, that means living on less than $14,335 in 1992 -- is now 14.5 percent, which is only slightly lower than it was in the 1960's.
