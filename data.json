If it had not been, they concluded, the dinosaurs might well have survived the impact, thereby changing the course of evolution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950103","headline":"Employee Killed in Lumber Store Robbery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/03/nyregion/employee-killed-in-lumber-store-robbery.html","abstract":"  An employee was shot to death yesterday when two hooded gunmen robbed a lumber warehouse store in Brooklyn, the police said.

An eccentric but absorbing mixture of documentary, fantasy and polemic, the film uses the image of hundreds of penguins marching stolidly across the frozen desert of Antarctica as a metaphor for nature's alarm at human cruelty and pollution. Moving in solemn processional columns, their chests puffed, their beaks raised high, the penguins look like nothing so much as a bunch of 17-century Pilgrims convening an emergency council to discuss the future of their colony.   Expanding on the notion of birds sitting in judgment on humans is the conversation that the Swiss film maker, who wrote the film with Franz Hohler, imagines the penguins are having with one another. As interpreted by the film's unseen narrator, their alarmed clucks and cries are a collective outcry against the arrival of a party of climate researchers. The penguins, he suggests, share a collective memory of a time earlier in the century when a whaling outpost on South Georgia Island polluted their habitat and threatened their very existence. To help fuel the outpost's processing plants, thousands of live penguins were fed into their furnaces. The film implicitly compares the torching of penguins with the horrors of the Nazi death camps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"Clinton's Luck Takes Upturn On Duck Hunt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/us/clinton-s-luck-takes-upturn-on-duck-hunt.html","abstract":"  A world away from the drained swamp that is Washington, President Clinton toted a borrowed shotgun into a flooded soybean field before dawn today and emerged three hours later bearing two dead ducks and a political message: assault weapons are bad, but banning them doesn't impede hunting, which is a good all-American sport.   \"I really started feeling like a person when I was about five minutes out on the water today,\" Mr. Clinton said with a grin after the outing on a friend's farm near Cotton Plant, about 80 miles northeast of here.

Right after the shooting spree that killed two people and injured five others at two abortion clinics in Massachusetts, Attorney General Janet Reno lamented that \"law enforcement does not have adequate resources to provide continuing protection for all threats.\"    Even after the subsequent gunshot attack on an abortion clinic in Virginia, two Republican Congressional leaders pushed the budgetary excuse vigorously. Senator Bob Dole, incoming Senate majority leader, called it \"pretty hard to police everything\" and said it could be \"very, very expensive\" to do so. The answer, he said, is to rely more on states and local communities. Similarly, Representative Henry Hyde, incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, expressed doubt that there were \"enough Federal marshals\" to assume Federal responsibility for clinics' safety. He suggested that clinics might hire guards, just as banks do, as \"part of the cost of doing business.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"House Set to Make Members Subject to the Rights Laws","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/us/house-set-to-make-members-subject-to-the-rights-laws.html","abstract":"  The first order of legislative business for the new Congress convening on Wednesday is a proposal to subject lawmakers to the civil rights and labor laws they have imposed on private employers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government.

It appropriated the synthesizer meditations of Brian Eno, the tape collages of France's classical musique concrete composers and the spacey drones of progressive rock to create what is known as ambient dance music, a form best heard while lying down. Whatever drum-machine beats there are in ambient dance music are mere sound effects, washing over the listener as part of an electronic collage made up of sampled records, rolling synthesizer arrangements and a panoply of street and nature sounds.   Lately, the avant-garde has been taking ambience back. The Kitchen, a longtime avant-garde art space, has started holding nights of ambient music; the 1970's electronic-music composer Klaus Schulze recently collaborated with the ambient musician Pete Namlook; the maverick producer and bassist Bill Laswell has started his own ambient-music record label; Steve Hillage, a former member of the progressive rock group Gong, has his own ambient band, and many local artists and experimental musicians have started reaching larger audiences by performing at ambient events.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"Brandeis and Cardozo : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/opinion/IHT-brandeis-and-cardozo-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Supreme Court Christmas Party Withstands Challenges\" (Dec. 17):.At the end of her piece, Joan Biskupic says, \"for the first time in history, the court has two Jewish justices.\" This is incorrect.

Beni Montresor's sets, with their pastel shades of pink, blue, yellow and green, offer a storybook view of the Italian countryside. Its components -- houses, a church, trees -- were painted on flat backdrops that ascended and descended with magical efficiency. And the bright costumes in which Mr. Montresor dressed his peasants and soldiers further the fairy-tale imagery, as did Gil Wechsler's soft lighting.   And why not? There are no brain-breaking themes, cosmic truths or moral lessons here, only a featherweight love story and a florid score that, when sung and played as well as it was on Monday, seems to float effortlessly through the sets and out into the house. There were a few needlessly silly touches: soldiers who marched backward and did peculiar dance steps, for example. But for the most part Elizabeth Bachman's staging was direct and traditional.

The play dates from a time when Goldoni was struggling to transport Venetian theater from the commedia dell'arte's wild improvisations on a bare scenario to the performance of fully written plays, and it has remnants of the commedia's slapstick along with an arsenal of tricks Goldoni devised to grab an audience's attention. The Pearl's version is wonderfully fresh, even if its exuberance at times reminds one of some stage experiments of the 1960's.   Mr. Rando and the actors approach Goldoni's contorted plot with the boisterous humor the playwright intended, often mocking it in asides to the audience, which he also wanted. There are elaborate schemes over a horde of jewels and gold, sword fights, fistfights, love duets, seduction attempts, flirtations with incest, battles with the law and endless confusions of identity, especially between twin brothers who have not seen each other in many years and who turn up in the same town on the same day.

Although the most vocal opposition to domestic partnerships is aimed at gay couples, giving them benefits doesn't undermine marriage.

Giuliani said yesterday that there would be a shortfall in tax revenues for the fourth quarter of 1994. Although the Mayor said it was too soon to determine the amount, administration officials said the shortfall would be at least $200 million and would certainly lead to even more budget cuts.    That shortfall comes on top of a budget gap that administration officials have already estimated at between $200 million and $500 million for the fiscal year that ends in June. And it comes after the administration took the unusual step of imposing nearly $800 million in spending cuts by impounding funds to keep its $31.6 billion budget in balance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950105","headline":"North America to See Casals Festival Concert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/arts/television-review-north-america-to-see-casals-festival-concert.html","abstract":"  Just in time for tourist season, the Arts & Entertainment Network's \"Stage\" series presents the \"38th Annual Pablo Casals Festival\" tonight in what is being billed as the first North American concert telecast of this prestigious event in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican tourist agency could hardly ask for more.   The legendary Pablo Casals -- cellist, composer and conductor -- established the Festival Casals in 1956. Raised in Catalonia, not far from Barcelona, he had fled Franco's Spain in the 1930's and become an ardent opponent of fascism. His ties to Puerto Rico were through his mother, who was born there. The festival's first concert was held on April 22, 1957. Casals performed a cello solo by Bach; his guest, the pianist Rudolf Serkin, offered Mozart and Schubert selections.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950105","headline":"Sports of The Times; 'Three-peat' Lore Haunts The Cowboys","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/sports/sports-of-the-times-three-peat-lore-haunts-the-cowboys.html","abstract":"  IT has usually been injuries or the aging of the best players, if not both.
