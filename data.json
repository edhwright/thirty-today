Its interior walls and ceilings are charred from an arson fire, and the pastel paint that lends it its nickname, the Pink House, is peeling and marred by graffiti. But for one group of New Rochelle residents, the building built in 1869 has potential for a brighter future. They have banded together to transform the Pink House into a children's library, community center and playground.\n\nEighteen months after that idea took root in informal kaffeeklatsches among 15 friends and neighbors, the group has made broad progress toward that goal. Their recently incorporated nonprofit organization, the Partnership for the Huguenot Children's Library, has received unsolicited donations of nearly $15,000. The city has agreed to lease the building to them for $1 a year and has pledged a matching grant of $25,000. The New Rochelle Public Library has agreed to run the library, provide the staff, select the books and equipment and program activities. And John Woodruff, a local architect, has drawn plans for the renovation and will oversee construction on a pro-bono basis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941030","headline":"Catherine Censor, Thomas E.

The first installment focused on Manhattan; the second on Queens. Because it is so large, Brooklyn has been split in two, with Flatbush Avenue as a natural divider. Taken as a whole, the area west of Flatbush has distinct characteristics, with less of the sweeping poverty of several neighborhoods to the east -- Bushwick, East New York and Brownsville. The emphasis of concerns differs by neighborhood -- traffic and parking in the northwest; loitering by youths in the southwest; flooding in Coney Island and Brighton Beach. Illegal dumping is raising anger; drugs keep people in fear, particularly around housing projects. Not all issues are mentioned in the map. It is simply a sampling of views of residents, merchants, police and community board officials. East of Flatbush will be examined next. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, DOWNTOWN, BOERUM HILL 1.

ILLEGAL DUMPING Misuse and abuse of vacant lots and other tracts throughout area. PARK SLOPE 18. PARKING New aggressive ticketing of cars that double park on alternate-side days.

The book is less a thoroughgoing analysis of musical technique than an anecdotal medley of the observations of a master. Vocalists who influenced him include the usual pantheon of gods (Bessie, Billie, Frank, Bing, Nat, Ella, Louis) and grandes dames (Ethel Waters, Mabel Mercer, Connee Boswell, Helen Forrest), as well as a few artists not known primarily for their singing: Johnny Mercer, Woody Herman, Fred Astaire. A gifted arranger and composer as well as a pre-eminent performer of American popular music, Mr. Torme displays the extent of his musicianship as he discusses the songwriters, instrumentalists, arrangers, bandleaders, vocal groups, Broadway and film vocalists and scat singers who are among his \"role models almost too numerous to mention.\" I was fascinated to read that he numbers among his \"heroes and heroines\" the offstage Hollywood singers who were the \"voices of the stars\" in the film musicals of the 1940's, 50's and 60's: Anita Ellis, Carole Richards, Martha Mears, Marni Nixon, Buddy Clark and others. (We learn that Robert McFerrin, father of the pop star Bobby McFerrin, was the singing voice of Sidney Poitier in the 1959 film \"Porgy and Bess.\") Mr. Torme, whose previous books include portraits of Buddy Rich (\"Traps, the Drum Wonder\") and Judy Garland (\"The Other Side of the Rainbow\"), remains a musician first and a writer second; no one reading \"My Singing Teachers\" will advise him to give up his night job.

YBOR CITY CHRONICLES: A Memoir (University Press of Florida, $24.95), Ferdie Pacheco's nostalgic account of his childhood in the late 1930's and early 1940's in the Latin quarter of Tampa, Fla., can confidently be called a stretcher. One senses that after 50 years, Dr. Pacheco has allowed the espresso to grow a bit stronger, the Cuban bread crustier and the neighborhood characters more intriguing. After all, as Dr. Pacheco, a television boxing commentator and Muhammad Ali's former physician, describes it, Ybor City's blend of cultures and classes proved fertile ground for mythmaking. There was, for example, the legendary figure of Sweet Sam, an elegant delivery man who owned a grand piano but mysteriously refused to play it. Dr. Pacheco's father also looms large, demanding Old World respect from his family. The author describes the restaurants, social clubs and movie theaters that serve as the backdrop for his memories. His stories are bolstered by photographs and his own cartoons, so the reader can actually see the place as he saw it. Dr. Pacheco is enthralled by the memory of a neighborhood of family and friends inextricably tied together by custom, values and concerns. It is these traits that make his anecdotes worth relating.

Situated 52 miles east of San Juan and 12 miles west of St. Thomas, Culebra is a lovely, rather rustic part of the Puerto Rican commonwealth consisting of 7,000 acres (including surrounding cays) and 1,600 inhabitants.  Like Vieques, a sister island nine miles to the south, Culebra attracts sun worshippers from the continental United States in winter and vacationers from the \"big island\" of Puerto Rico in summer. Its powdery beaches also lure several varieties of sea turtle, including the giant leatherback, the largest of all marine reptiles. Between February and July, leatherback females, averaging 6 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds, clamber onto Culebra's shores at night to deposit their eggs before returning to the water to undertake a long and (to humans) mysterious migration from the Caribbean Sea to colder waters.    Unlike other sea turtles, of which there are seven species in all according to the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington, leatherbacks venture into open ocean and frigid latitudes. They dive more than 4,000 feet -- even deeper than whales -- to procure jellyfish, their major food source. The carapace that gives them their name also sets them apart from greens, hawksbills, loggerheads, and ridleys, turtles whose carapace is made of bone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941030","headline":"POSTINGS: State Report; Rent Regulation From 1943 to '93","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/realestate/postings-state-report-rent-regulation-from-1943-to-93.html","abstract":"  On Nov. 1, 1943, the Federal Office of Price Administration issued regulations freezing New York City rents at their March 1, 1943, levels.

Rollins is as busy as ever.   In California, Mr. Rollins is helping direct the Senate campaign of Representative Michael Huffington, a Republican, against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat in her first term.    In Washington State, Mr. Rollins is trying to unseat House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, another Democrat, and replace him with a lawyer from Spokane, George Nethercutt. And in New York, Mr. Rollins is championing the campaign of Bernadette Castro, a political neophyte, against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.   Mr. Rollins set off a storm after Mrs. Whitman's victory when he boasted that he had pulled the election out of the bag, in part, by suppressing the black vote in urban and largely Democratic areas. Mr. Rollins contended that he had set aside $500,000 in \"walking around money\" that he instructed the campaign to use in the final days before the election to bribe black ministers to keep them from making endorsements from their pulpits for Gov. Jim Florio, who was seeking re-election.   Under pressure from Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Rollins quickly recanted, calling his statement a fit of bravado. Inquiries by Federal and state grand juries failed to turn up evidence to prove the initial statement.   Except for the uproar Mr. Rollins would be making an encore visit this year to New Jersey. The Republican Senate candidate, Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian, had asked Mr. Rollins to work in his campaign, but swiftly backed out when the controversy broke.   Mention of the issue still raises rancor in many quarters.   \"I don't think the outrage of the Rollins affair has dampened whatsoever,\" said Walter L. Fields Jr., political director for the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  \"We haven't forgotten the Rollins incident. But most of us have put it in the back of our minds, because we have been concentrating on other problems.\"   Mr. Rollins returned to New Jersey in June to meet black ministers and issue a private and a public apology, which the ministers accepted.   \"We can forgive,\" said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson of the St. Matthew African Methodist Episcopal Church in Orange. \"But forgiving is not forgetting.\"   But there are harsher feelings about Mr. Rollins.   \"Rollins was a liar, and you don't have people lie on you and feel good about it,\" said Donald Tucker, an at-large member of the Newark City Council and the chairman of the New Jersey Black Issues Convention, a coalition of black elected officials, businessmen and civic leaders. \"The damage that he has done will outlive him.

He surely could have been a justice of the Supreme Court. Although it is not too late for the Court, there seems only one certain way for him to claim an exalted place in the history books. That is to have a memorably successful fourth term.    This newspaper thinks he can do that. We not only recommend his re-election; we urge it as essential to New York's progress. We are mindful of his shortcomings and we are sometimes annoyed by the gap between the Cuomo rhetoric and the Cuomo reality. It is also true that New York has lagged behind a nationwide economic recovery. We nevertheless believe that Mr. Cuomo towers above his opponents.

Rows of somber little black-and-white photographs, lined up on racks that look like stylized gutters, scarcely throb with the poetry that architects like Carlo Scarpa, Pier Luigi Nervi, Gio Ponti and Franco Albini brought to modern architecture at midcentury. Still, the show (on view until Jan. 22) can bring on a serious case of period envy. What is most enviable about the presentation is not the quality of individual buildings designed in the postwar decades. It is the extent to which the period produced a sense of itself as a period: an era when architects believed that they were collectively shaping a time and place.   That faith, a cornerstone of the modern movement, has largely disappeared from architecture today. Where architects once drew meaning from being part of something larger than themselves, many now derive it from the distance they can place between themselves and their contemporaries. Certainly there has been no shortage of architectural movements since 1968; indeed, so many have come and gone that even the tireless chronicler Charles Jencks has grown weary of tracking them.

The presses have a threadbare look about them, and many could draw up wish lists well beyond the proverbial three. Like their trade press counterparts, the university presses are eager to cut operating costs and enhance revenues; but confusion and concern persist for many editors and directors about the possibilities of the electronic universe, about who's in charge and, specifically for on-line publishing, how to charge for what the presses might put into circulation.\n\nFrank Urbanowski, the director for the past 18 years of MIT Press, believes he has had no choice but to take up the challenge: \"We think that, by the end of this decade, if not now, 100 percent of our readership will be cruising the Internet. My vision of this is that everything we put in print now will have to be digitized.\" In his office in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Urbanowski doesn't reach for the press catalogue to give bookish weight to his argument. Instead, he turns to the monitor on his desk and keys us into Mosaic -- \"the ubiquitous browser of the Internet,\" he says with a smile, \"a killer application\" -- and calls up the MIT Press home page, or opening menu, on the World Wide Web, an on-line service that is part of the Internet.

Fourteen years after the quartet broke up, as a result of the alcohol-related death of John Bonham, its drummer, Led Zeppelin's music remains a backdrop to the high school years of teen-agers everywhere.
