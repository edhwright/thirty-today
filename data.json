The convening of the 104th Congress last week appears to have accelerated the phenomenon of electronic democracy, which has been spreading along with the personal computer.    Electronic democracy is far from perfectly democratic, given the high relative cost of computer equipment, phone service and information fees. Recent demographic surveys of the Internet reveal an electronic citizenry that is predominantly white, male, educated and well to do. But there are countless resources available to those who want to make the effort to keep tabs on the new Congress, a new Governor or a new City Council.

There is none. Yet in every decade since the 1950's, throngs of foreign-policy experts have asserted that NATO faced some new crisis. Now comes the crisis of the 90's -- the fragility of democracy in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the loss of a common enemy -- and therefore, it is said, NATO must admit Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and other nations of the former Warsaw Pact. This remedy may seem all the more urgent as Russian forces keep inflicting wanton destruction on Chechnya.   Americans who question the wisdom of this eastward expansion fear that it might cause Russia to refurbish its military and expand westward. But this is only half the problem. Far from solving an alleged crisis, expanding NATO now would fatally weaken it. The Atlantic alliance must not become a chain letter -- some Ponzi scheme that escapes bankruptcy only by signing up new members.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Developments in Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/us/the-104th-congress-diary-developments-in-congress.html","abstract":"  HOUSE -- Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, offered Republicans a painless way to cut the budget: changing the way the Government calculates inflation.

World War II and 50 years of Japanese protectionism reduced that to zero, but Ford is now spearheading a resurgence of U.S. car sales in Japan. Ford boosted its Japan sales by 198 percent this year by improving quality, acquiring 300 showrooms, letting Japanese auto writers drive across America in a Taurus and even sponsoring the Hiroshima professional soccer team, which won the national championship with the Ford logo on its jerseys. Last year Ford sold out its allotment of Mustangs for Japan in two months.   This is not a Ford commercial. But the Ford example is worth highlighting because it comes at a time when so many other U.S. businesses are giving up on Japan, saying that it is just too expensive and aggravating to keep trying to break into the closed Japanese market. Better, they argue, to focus sales -- and U.S. trade diplomacy -- on more open emerging markets in Indonesia, Malaysia, China and India. They call this \"Japan Fatigue,\" and it is a virus that has infected large segments of the U.S. business community and Government.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Doubleheader:An Inspired Pairing of Rogues and Dangerous Allies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/style/IHT-doubleheaderan-inspired-pairing-of-rogues-and-dangerous-allies.html","abstract":"One play is just a play; two are an event.

This brings to an end years of speculation among hoop fans over where the prodigiously gifted young player will go. And it will surely provoke a raft of stories using Marbury's hard-earned success to illustrate how basketball can deliver talented and dedicated inner-city youth from the ghetto to stardom in college and, just maybe, a shot at the pros. \n\nMarbury grew up in the impoverished Coney Island section of Brooklyn, honing his game on the housing project courts, often playing until 2 A.M. as the sound of police sirens and gunfire drifted in from nearby streets. When I met him four years ago, he was only 14 but already had his sights fixed on the day he would leave the neighborhood on a basketball scholarship.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Former Housing Secretary Won't Be Charged in Investigation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/us/former-housing-secretary-won-t-be-charged-in-investigation.html","abstract":"  After a five-year investigation, an independent prosecutor has decided not to bring charges against Samuel R.

Ms. Hellman, a slender 79-year-old with sensational cheekbones, who has recently taken up Rollerblading, led the way into her sunlit parlor. Her two black Pomeranians yelped. Her caged birds sang. There were throws on the couches, and books lay turned over to mark their place. The room was just messy enough to be perfectly inviting.

Mr. Vallone wants the central Board of Education expanded from seven to nine members, with the Council picking the extra two members. That would only worsen the existing clutter of appointing powers.   Each of the five borough presidents now appoints one member, and the mayor appoints two. It is a formula for diffuse authority and little accountability. This page has long advocated giving the mayor, who is responsible to voters, more control over the board through additional appointments. It makes little sense to further fragment the board by inserting the City Council. Any change in the board would have to be approved by the State Legislature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Italian Leaders Still Wrestling Coalition Crisis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/world/italian-leaders-still-wrestling-coalition-crisis.html","abstract":"  Three weeks after the resignation of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Italian leaders this week are inching toward a formula for an interim government to lead the country out of its political stalemate.

One was Stanley Siegal. The other was Tom Snyder, who, as it happens, has had his subsequently flagging career gloriously revived. Coming off a talk series on CNBC, he is now the host of CBS's new \"Late Late Show\" immediately after David Letterman, who years ago replaced Mr. Snyder in the slot immediately after Johnny Carson. Ain't show business grand?    Mr. Snyder returns amid much palaver that he is a changed man, someone who realizes that, hey, it's just a job, not a life. He is supposedly less brash. But Mr. Snyder has always been less brash than goofy, unable to resist an off-the-wall insight, usually accompanied by his own delighted laugh. Happily, he hasn't changed much. He's grayer and even a bit thinner but still unexpectedly prickly. His first anecdote on his first CBS show was about a broadcast-center security guard who had the nerve not to recognize him. Then he took a swipe at Mr. Carson, who, unlike Mr. Letterman on Monday night, never plugged his show in all their years at NBC.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950111","headline":"Gingrich Knew of Comment By Historian, Her Aide Says","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/us/104th-congress-speaker-gingrich-knew-comment-historian-her-aide-says.html","abstract":"  Speaker Newt Gingrich, who dismissed the House historian on Monday over her comments about an educational program on the Holocaust, knew about those statements before he hired her, an assistant to the former historian said today.
