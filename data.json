Kiri Te Kanawa's recital on Wednesday night made much of both, indeed, leaned heavily on them at times when other requirements were less forthcoming. The soprano from New Zealand has perfected a stage persona that mixes dignity with shy self-deprecation. At 50, Miss Te Kanawa has a voice that still works beautifully, easing through music from Handel's \"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\" and \"Amadigi di Gaula\" with a technique that flowed like thick, smooth cream.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940521","headline":"Sanitation Commissioner Is Resigning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/21/nyregion/sanitation-commissioner-is-resigning.html","abstract":"  Sanitation Commissioner Emily Lloyd, one of a handful of holdovers from the Dinkins administration, announced yesterday that she was leaving city government to become a vice president at Columbia University.

Crimes involving handguns in 1992 rose by almost 50 percent over the average for the previous five years. And more people are being killed with such weapons; handgun homicides for 1992 were up 24 percent over the five-year average.   Interestingly, the handgun epidemic has spread even as non-fatal violent crime declined. The rate of violent crime peaked in 1981 and is today the same as it was in 1973. But while fewer people are being attacked, more of the attacks that do occur involve handguns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940521","headline":"Review/Television; Amusingly Eccentric British Royal Rituals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/21/arts/review-television-amusingly-eccentric-british-royal-rituals.html","abstract":"  Public television's enduring love affair with British nobs finds expression again tonight on \"Days of Majesty,\" a colorful two-hour tour of royal ceremonies, some of ancient lineage.

It is an example that will, regrettably, almost surely be ignored by other third-world liberators-for-life, most especially Cuba's Fidel Castro, North Korea's Kim Il Sung and Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko.   Most of Malawi's eight million people were not even alive when the former British colony, which was then called Nyasaland, attained independence in 1964. A physician given to vehement oratory, Dr. Banda led Malawi's liberation struggle and served as its first Prime Minister. In what became a pattern in post-colonial Africa, he then promoted himself to President, instituted one-party rule and in 1971 enthroned himself President-for-life. And as elsewhere, a cult of personality flourished and political dissenters were silenced, jailed or killed by security police.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940521","headline":"Migrant Oasis; Central American Day Laborers Are Drawn to a Suburb","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/21/nyregion/migrant-oasis-central-american-day-laborers-are-drawn-to-a-suburb.html","abstract":"  Journeying across nations in search of work, Lazaro Chinchilla arrived here about a month ago to share a run-down bungalow with seven other men in a rugged settlement of migrants like himself.   \"Hunger brought us here,\" Mr. Chinchilla, an immigrant from Guatemala, said the other day as he wandered along one of the dusty roads that lace the settlement, called El Petencito by its residents. \"But it feels like we have come to the edge of the earth.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940521","headline":"Some Original Beatniks On a Trip To the Past","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/21/arts/some-original-beatniks-on-a-trip-to-the-past.html","abstract":"  The audience at Town Hall on Thursday night punctuated the performance by applauding, laughing and shouting requests.

He doesn't abandon the dance forms and gracious manners of French Baroque opera. The singing doesn't explode in Lucia-like extravagance. The remarkable expressions are contained, restrained; the sense comes through subtle shifts in texture, and through the clearly articulated French text, which is almost always set with one note for each syllable.   But by now, William Christie and his early-music group, Les Arts Florissants, have shown how large a universe of emotion lies compressed in this musical style, how a supple sense of pulse governs these declamations, how violence, jealousy and tenderness can be revealed in the ways in which lines are sung and text pronounced.

The Surrealists claimed him for obvious reasons, the Existentialists for less obvious ones, even the fascist Franco because Goya was Spanish and patriotic and the servant to a succession of rulers. Most recently, a major traveling exhibition in 1989 served up Goya the liberal, a figure more in tune with post-Franco Spain.   Goya is too complex an artist to fit neatly into any of these slots, and it comes almost as a relief that \"Goya: Truth and Fantasy,\" here at the Royal Academy, doesn't try. It celebrates him simply as a brilliant painter.

Peculiarly, Lincoln Center is sharpening its knives even though the festival seems healthy and robust. Last season, the festival's 39 New York concerts (which were followed by a tour to Tokyo) earned $1.9 million in ticket sales, the second-highest sum in its history; it played to nearly 90 percent of capacity in Avery Fisher Hall. And some of the programming for this season is appealing: Joshua Rifkin conducts Bach's B-minor Mass, Gerard Schwarz leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and performers include Hans Vonk, Vladimir Feltsman, Martha Argerich, Hermann Prey and Shura Cherkassky.   But since 1992, the festival has been operating under a shadow of Mozart-weariness. That summer, a year after its triumphant 25th anniversary, Mostly Mozart seemed a desultory affair, sweeping up crumbs left by Lincoln Center's 19-month commemoration of the bicentennial of the composer's death. Both festivals were heartily attacked in these pages for their lack of imagination.

An orchestral program on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall will juxtapose Ives with Carl Ruggles, his even more solitary and impenetrable contemporary; Henry Brant, whose \"spatial\" music was foreshadowed by Ives's experiments with multiple ensembles, and Wallingford Riegger, who echoed Ivesian dissonance and polyrhythms in clean linear form.

But his adoptive parent, the Walt Disney Company, is increasingly finding itself cast as the bad guy as it tries to build a historical theme park, Disney's America, near hallowed Civil War ground in Virginia.

It's getting bloody, and far more than a single business enterprise is at stake. The battle over Disney's America is part of a much larger struggle between theme-park America and authentic America: Will this country preserve its real history, which requires education and reflection to be understood, or simply turn it over to the Imagineers of Disney, to be repackaged as socko virtual reality?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"CHILDREN'S BOOKS;\nDogspell","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/books/childrens-books-dogspell.html","abstract":"ABC\nWritten and illustrated\nby William Wegman.\nUnpaged.

The subtitle is misleading: Robert Emmet Long's sensible text briefly summarizes and analyzes every film Mr. Bergman has written or directed, but only those stage productions that have traveled to New York in recent years receive more than a polite nod. The book contains plenty of shots of Mr. Bergman at work, though most of the more than 200 photographs are taken from his movies. \"Fanny and Alexander\" and \"The Magic Flute\" are amply illustrated, in color as well as in black and white, while masterpieces like \"Winter Light\" and \"The Passion of Anna\" are slighted. There is a splendid two-page reproduction of the dance of death from \"The Seventh Seal,\" yet turn the page to \"Wild Strawberries\" and you won't find a single image from the opening dream sequence. \"Now About These Women,\" which Mr. Long says \"is commonly considered Bergman's worst film,\" gets more picture space than \"Persona,\" which is possibly his best. The captions are occasionally instructive and occasionally erroneous (if that's Erland Josephson on page 119, I'm August Strindberg). Mr. Long, the author of \"The Films of Merchant Ivory,\" writes about Mr. Bergman's \"intense preoccupation with women, perceived with a ripe sensuousness.\" Thus it is no surprise that the stars of this book are remarkable actresses like Liv Ullmann and the magnificent Anderssons, Harriet and Bibi.

A fair amount of art history -- and cultural history in general -- is a search for precedent and antecedents. Though the notion of progress in art has long been in disrepute, the theme of development and continuity, the idea that what happened yesterday flowed with a certain observable logic out of the day before and helps explain what went on at 10:52 A.M. today, remains a shaping force in art studies (not to mention human thought in general).   \"Pictorial Effect/Naturalistic Vision\" at the Art Museum at Princeton University (through June 6) gives visual scope to a 19th-century controversy that though it might seem arcane, sheds light on the nature of photography as well as on its course over the last century. This show of 102 prints is the first to compare the work of Henry Peach Robinson (1830-1901), the pre-eminent English art photographer of his day, and Peter Henry Emerson (1856-1936), who in the 1880's developed a serene landscape art and a dexterous way with vitriol as a challenge to Robinson's esthetic and his popular manual of photographic instruction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"POSTINGS: Landmark East Side Complex; Long-Running Fight Comes to an End","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/realestate/postings-landmark-east-side-complex-long-running-fight-comes-to-an-end.html","abstract":"  Since 1984, the City and Suburban York Avenue Estate, a 14-building complex on the Upper East Side, has been the scene of a bitter dispute over tenant rights, development interests and historic preservation.

They are divided into picture books and storybooks (picture books, with minimal text, for babies and preschoolers, and storybooks for elementary-school children); chapter books (novels divided into chapters for middle- and upper-grade readers); series books of more than three titles, often sold by the group title; activity books, frequently packaged with merchandise and instructions; and collections of poetry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/sports/transactions-173118.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"Recitals Give Way To Festivals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/music-recitals-give-way-to-festivals.html","abstract":"  IN days past the concert season was concluded by the end of April; now there's hardly a break between the end of spring recitals and the start of summer festivals.

By fall, construction is expected to begin on the project's first building, a 39-story apartment building designed by Cesar Pelli. A lot of planning has gone into this $2.3 billion project, and it has produced some excellent features. With the river at its doorstep, the Manhattan skyline for a backdrop and Grand Central Terminal just one subway stop away, Queens West is shaping up to be a wonderful place to live.   But for those concerned about the vitality of architecture in New York, Queens West may turn out to be a disturbing place to visit. Like Battery Park City, the project provides a framework in which individual buildings can be joined together in a cohesive urban whole. What it has yet to do is address one of Battery Park City's most conspicuous shortcomings: its failure to nurture the architectural creativity that could bring the urban whole to life. The shortcoming is not limited to Battery Park City. New York has seen few buildings of genuine distinction arise in recent years. The issue raised by Queens West is whether the public sector has a responsibility to revive an art form that has languished in historical pastiche.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"New Haven Prepares for 6,500 Athletes and 500,000 Spectators","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/nyregion/new-haven-prepares-for-6500-athletes-and-500000-spectators.html","abstract":"  THE 1995 Special Olympics World Games are more than a year away, but at the games headquarters in New Haven activity is already heating up.

Still, taking aim where she can, Ms. Mairs attacks Ms. Lifton's literary style (a surprise, considering her long and distinguished career), as well as her references to Robert Bly and Joseph Campbell. Ms. Mairs finds it convenient to omit that the poet Stanley Kunitz, the psychologist Erik Erikson and Carl Jung are drawn upon just as frequently as those two.

McAlmon the writer was largely ignored in his lifetime (1896-1956) because of his uncanny ability to make enemies; these enemies (notably F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway) in turn blocked McAlmon from being published in this country. McAlmon's novels, short fiction and poetry were published almost exclusively in France, and even those copies were barred from entry into the United States (because he wrote about homosexuals and prostitutes); thus his reputation has rested not on his writings but on contemporary opinion, which was often based on personal feelings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940522","headline":"Calling All Nit-Pickers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/books/l-calling-all-nit-pickers-151661.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Regarding Henry Kissinger's reply (Letters, April 24) to Ernest R.

J. Foyt's decision to stick with the earlier qualifying speed of his driver, Bryan Herta, paid off yesterday at the Indianapolis 500 trials. The car survived four last-minute attempts to bump it out of the 33-car lineup for the race next Sunday. With 25 minutes left in qualifying, Marco Greco bumped Scott Goodyear with a four-lap, 10-mile run of 221.216 miles an hour in a Lola-Cosworth. After Greco qualified, Herta, Foyt's rookie driver, was the top man on the bump list as the slowest remaining car. Geoff Brabham then called off his run after three laps because he was going too slow. Mark Smith then spun and crashed in the first turn of his first lap. Gary Bettenhausen then ran two laps but called off the run as too slow. At that point, Foyt could have sent Herta out in a faster spare car, but he thought that Willy T. Ribbs, the only challenger left, did not have enough laps in his car to go fast enough. Foyt's decision worked, as Ribbs quit after two laps that were too slow.

Either they will recall the stress and strain the Rangers endured before finally eliminating a stubborn rival and reaching the Stanley Cup finals or they will remember the tortoise-and-the-hare approach of the Devils, who never got the respect and attention of the local public, even when they overtook the Rangers and upset them before moving on to the championship round.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940523","headline":"Working the 24 Hours of a Day, and Even Longer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/23/nyregion/working-the-24-hours-of-a-day-and-even-longer.html","abstract":"  For Martin E. Gotkin, conviction and disbarment for defrauding the Assigned Counsel Plan were only temporary setbacks. Last year he was paid $124,175 by the program, more than any lawyer in Manhattan or the Bronx. Now he is billing as a private investigator.   Mr. Gotkin pleaded guilty in 1981 to a charge of grand larceny and was fined $20,000 for submitting inflated legal bills to the Assigned Counsel Plan. On hundreds of days over three years, he had billed for more court hours than the courts were even open, according to court documents. On 27 occasions, he billed for more than 24 hours in a single day. On one day in 1978, he claimed he worked 28 hours in court and 22 out of court.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940523","headline":"Sports of The Times; Ewing Raises His Game, and Then Raises His Hands","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-ewing-raises-his-game-and-then-raises-his-hands.html","abstract":"  HE had no points at halftime, which is a rather serious condition for a superstar who has said he would help take his team to a championship one of these years, before it gets too late.

The setting is Rainbow and Stars, seemingly perched in the clouds and wrapped in glitter. It's just like a scene from those old movies, Hollywood's idealized version of how things used to be.   With that image fresh in your mind, visiting Ms. Haran at her home on a tree-lined street in Park Slope, Brooklyn, can feel like culture shock, in a nice sort of way. For one thing, this neighborhood is a jumble of ethnic groups and languages, a place inhabited by the kinds of people who rarely appeared in studio films of the 1950's as anything but maids or chauffeurs. Except maybe for Louis Armstrong, Ms. Haran says, who always played himself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940523","time":"1994-05-23
