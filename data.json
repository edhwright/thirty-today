The fifth-seeded Sabatini, an Argentine who has made this pristine island her second home, self-destructed on a tactical infrastructure overrun by 18 double faults and 69 unforced errors.   Sabatini tripped herself up despite the fact that her underdog opponent, Kimiko Date of Japan, was grimacing through their semifinal with a serving shoulder so tender that she clutched it after almost every point.    No matter. Sabatini, with perspiration spilling across her face like sequins and double faults spilling from her racquet like so many lost hopes, suffered a humiliating 1-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) defeat to the seventh-seeded Date.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Fire Rages in Chelsea","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/nyregion/fire-rages-in-chelsea.html","abstract":"  A three-alarm fire raged for more than an hour in an 11-story office building in Chelsea last night, injuring six firefighters, who were treated for exhaustion and minor smoke inhalation, fire officials said.

Showtime is reaching back to the mid-1960's to offer an updated revival of \"The Outer Limits,\" an anthology that had a modest original run of about a year and a half. Showtime has already committed to 43 new weekly episodes. As the millennium approaches, extraterrestrials and the supernatural are obviously going to be with us for a while. Batten down the hatches, kiddies.   This new version of \"The Outer Limits\" retains the Control Voice that warns at the fuzzy outset of each program: \"There is nothing wrong with your television. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are now controlling the transmission. . . . We will control all that you see and hear.

The screens are about 8 inches long and 1.75 inches high, and can accommodate two 40-character lines of text. The $2 million system will be installed during the summer and will be used at all performances beginning next season.   Titling has been a matter of considerable dispute at the Met, one of the last major opera houses to resist simultaneous translation. James Levine, the company's artistic director, has said that supertitles would be used \"over my dead body,\" and in a news conference after the demonstration, both Mr. Levine and Joseph Volpe, the company's general manager, reasserted their opposition in principle to translations. But they added that their strongest objection was to projected titles, which they said interfere with the stage action and also disturb those who prefer not to use translations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Fencing Off the Women's Conference","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/opinion/fencing-off-the-women-s-conference.html","abstract":"  The United Nations Secretariat is tarnishing a forthcoming conference on women's issues by denying credentials to a slew of non-governmental organizations, possibly more than 200, without explaining why. The action has bred suspicion that the Secretariat is responding to political pressures from the conference's Chinese hosts or such powerful participants as the Vatican.   In several instances, the denials resulted from direct pressure. The Chinese, who were eager to have Beijing as the conference site, pledged that the forum would be open to all relevant non-governmental as well as governmental groups. However, they asked, and got, the U.N. to deny credentials to women's organizations from Taiwan and Tibet, their political adversaries. The Vatican does not want to hear from Catholics critical of the church's views on family life and abortion.

First there was the early hoopla when the museum identified the artists to be included and even showed slides of their works. Then came the inevitable backlash, the published lists of those neglected, the complaints about the ones chosen: that there aren't enough young and hip artists, that there is too much painting and not enough Conceptual and political art, that some artists are too well known, others are completely unknown and a few are just friends of the exhibition's curator, Klaus Kertess. Critics agreed about only one point: that the 1995 biennial isn't like the politically top-heavy 1993 show.   Biennials are the art world's Rorschach tests. They are what you bring to them. I like this one, despite the eccentric and occasionally pallid choices Mr. Kertess has made. The show, which opened yesterday, is low key.

And this impulse is vividly underscored by Ronald Hayman's magisterial new biography, a biography that not only explicates the many intimate correspondences between Mann and his own heroes but that also demonstrates just how minutely the overarching themes of his work -- art, death and illness -- remained rooted in his own emotional and familial conflicts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Montana Cuts Homosexual Acts From List of Registered Crimes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/us/montana-cuts-homosexual-acts-from-list-of-registered-crimes.html","abstract":"  Feeling political heat from around the state and the country, the Montana Senate executed an about-face yesterday, deleting homosexual acts from a list of crimes for which convicts must be registered their entire lives.

In a span of 12 hours, he lost a game at the buzzer and then awoke to hear that his father, Gary, had died from a freakish foot infection. Jerod Haase needed out, and he needed out fast, and, this winter and spring he has risen again as a Kansas transfer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Rison Receives a Rich Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/sports/sports-people-football-rison-receives-a-rich-deal.html","abstract":"  ANDRE RISON has committed himself to the Cleveland Browns, striking a $17 million, five-year deal that makes him the highest-paid receiver in National Football League history, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported yesterday.

Should Sampras win that confrontation, he would be the first man to capture three titles here. Should Agassi prevail, he would avenge last year's loss to Sampras in the final and inch closer to the top spot on the computer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"A Conference on Gangs Where Gangs Have a Say","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/nyregion/our-towns-a-conference-on-gangs-where-gangs-have-a-say.html","abstract":"  WHEN Mildred marched to the podium to plead her case, two middle-age women in the packed University of Connecticut auditorium gasped in sympathy. \"She's so pretty,\" one whispered. \"And young,\" the other said. \"So young.\"    Mildred, 22, looked like a chic high school student, with her gray pants and vest, and white blouse, and brown hair hanging down like a model's.

Though Mr. Grey and Mr. Moody represent different eras and radically different sensibilities, what they have in common is authority and wit. They also share the ability to bring an audience into their inventions, to show them exactly what their improvisations are for and what they mean.   Mr. Grey, who is 69, shared the front line of his band with the trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison and the saxophonist Jerome Richardson on Tuesday night, and together they performed five blues compositions and a few standards. Their swing language, precise and edited, almost surreally exact in improvisation, is so laden with blues ideas that even the standards ended up being blues. Mr. Edison's version of \"Lover Man,\" filled with bent blues notes and sharply articulated riffs, was a reminder of how rich the swing vocabulary was and how much has been lost conceptually.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"BRIEFCASE : International Alliance In Mutual Fund Industry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/your-money/IHT-briefcase-international-alliance-in-mutual-fund-industry.html","abstract":"The mutual fund industry took an important step toward becoming genuinely international this week with the announcement of the alliance between the American fund manager Massachusetts Financial Services, Hypo Bank of Germany and the British fund manager F","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"Broadway Robbery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/opinion/broadway-robbery.html","abstract":"  Why do tickets for a Broadway show cost $75?

Mr. Redman, the hottest of jazz's hot young saxophonists, produced his best improvisation of the set, a brazenly imaginative solo that rattled around from register to register, set up contrasts, and seemed strikingly open to the idea that all sound could be incorporated into a swinging context. That sort of improvising is why Mr. Redman's reputation is as exalted as it is: at times he fulfills his promise.   Much of the rest of the set, however, seemed stillborn. Mr. Redman is breaking in a new band -- Peter Martin on piano, Chris Thomas on bass and Brian Blade on drums -- that hasn't yet picked up a personality. The musicians never went beyond the functional, and formally there wasn't much sense of play. Even the normally buoyant and inspired Mr. Redman seemed merely enthusiastic. His improvisations, even on a bad night, are graceful, loping with occasional crashes into a lower register blues phrase. He has been cultivating his upper register, and on most solos on Tuesday he found himself in the zone beyond the natural range of the instrument, drawing lines that seemed less precise or reliant on a specific pitch. They seemed metaphorical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"Yesterday in Washington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/us/diary-yesterday-in-washington.html","abstract":"  TAX CUTS -- Agitation over the Republicans' promised tax cuts broadened as dozens of moderate House Republicans, joined by 23 Democrats who have consistently voted with the majority, demanded that the cuts be delayed until it was clear how they would be paid for. Earlier in the week, 102 Republicans in the House broke ranks with the leadership on the proposed $500 tax credit for families with children. The combined developments suggest trouble for Speaker Newt Gingrich. SPENDING CUTS -- The Senate Appropriations Committee slashed $13 billion from hundreds of Federal programs as a way to reduce the budget deficit and pay for disaster aid to California. The measure cleared the committee by unanimous consent after Democrats agreed to hold their amendments, and their rancor, for the Senate floor.  WELFARE REFORM -- The House approved one of the most important items on the Republican agenda, a measure to undo six decades of Federal social-welfare legislation. The vote, almost entirely on party lines, was 234 to 199. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION -- The Senate voted to repeal a communications tax break intended to bolster minority ownership of cable and broadcast companies. The repeal, passed on a voice vote, is a blow to the entertainment giant Viacom Inc. The company's plan to use the 17-year-old tax break to defer nearly $500 million in Federal taxes on the sale of its cable systems propelled the provision into the spotlight. On another issue, Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, told a House panel: \"This Administration is committed to the goal of expanding opportunity for all Americans in education, employment and the economy generally.

Clearly there is still residual affection between London and Washington, born of a common language and a camaraderie that dates from World War II. But the end of the cold war has changed what was once a fairly simple equation, much as it has altered America's relationship with the rest of its allies.

Winds on the defenders' course off San Diego started out at a brisk 15 knots, then subsided to a less rocky 9 knots.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL  Lincoln Reaches State Final  Gerard Hawkins scored 25 points and Abraham Lincoln of Brooklyn shut down the defending champion, La Salle of Niagara Falls (26-1), in the fourth quarter yesterday to win, 61-44, in the Class A semifinals of the New York State Federation boys tournament in Glens Falls. A 26-4 run by Lincoln (25-3) early in the final period opened a tight game and gave the Railsplitters a 59-37 lead. The triumph set up a state championship game tonight between the two best schools in New York City, Lincoln, the P.S.A.L. champion, and Christ the King of Queens, the C.H.S.A.A. champion, which was a 66-59 winner over Long Island Lutheran in yesterday's other Class A semifinal. Lamar Odum had 16 points and Eric Barclay 15 to lead Christ the King (23-2). Another all-New York City final was certified after Jarrett Lockhart scored 22 points and had 9 rebounds as Mount St. Michael of the Bronx (27-1) held off a rally by Poughkeepsie (23-4) for a 73-63 victory in the Class B semifinal. Mount St. Michael will meet Francis Lewis of Queens in the final at 7 tonight.

Zagata, the new Commissioner for Environmental Conservation, says the state should begin telling people that if they want cleaner air and water, they must pay more of the bill.    \"We've got to start educating the public about the fact that some of the burden for getting the last increment that's left is going to shift from industry to the consumer,\" he said in an interview after his confirmation by the State Senate on Monday. \"We have not done a good job of that, and that's why I think you're seeing a revolt.\"    That revolt, he said, is being led by ordinary citizens who object to paying more for cleaner-burning gasoline and cleaner-running cars, for public purchases of scenic land and the cleanup of toxic waste on industrial sites. He said that if people do not want to pay, they must understand that making industry foot the bill will hurt the economy.    \"Do we want to say, 'Industry, you're going to have to clean up even though it's a 200-to-1 higher cost,' and run the risk of driving industry out of the state?\" he asked.    In his quest to balance economic interests with environmental ones, Mr. Zagata reflects the dual -- critics would say contradictory -- mission of Gov. George E. Pataki. The Governor has won plaudits from environmentalists, but also campaigned last year to reduce regulation, often citing the Department of Environmental Conservation as a prime example of burdensome bureaucracy. Mr. Pataki now wants Mr. Zagata to satisfy both sides: be less onerous to industry without being less vigilant about pollution.    Without offering details, Mr. Zagata said he envisioned a variety of policies to reverse his agency's reputation for punishing companies rather than working with them to solve environmental problems.    He said he would establish programs to educate companies about regulations so arcane that \"the way a piece of paper is filed\" can be a violation. He would require inspectors to perform their work in fewer visits to avoid \"interrupting production.\" He would speed issuance of pollution and building permits.    And he would give companies more opportunities to correct pollution problems before the state takes enforcement action. To do that, he would have inspectors perform \"environmental audits\" that inform companies about possible pollution violations. Six months later, another team of inspectors would review whether the company had taken steps to reverse those problems. If steps were taken, no fines or penalties would be levied.    \"For the last several years, the appearance has been that our mission has been enforcement rather than compliance,\" he said.     But Mr. Zagata said he did not want the agency to be all carrots and no sticks. \"Enforcement is definitely a tool in my bag of tricks,\" he told a State Senate committee on Monday.    Mr. Zagata cites economic issues in suggesting that he might change the department's direction on other matters. He questioned whether the state should continue plans to centralize its auto-inspection system and to require that 2 percent of all new cars offered for sale by 1998 be electric-powered. He voiced concerns about whether the state should buy more land in the Adirondacks, saying he did not want to hurt local towns by reducing their tax bases.    And he said that any plan to protect New York City's watershed must not harm the economies of watershed towns, criticizing city officials for \"walking away from the table\" during negotiations with those towns.     Mr. Zagata's comments have already infuriated some environmentalists. Lee Wasserman, executive director of Environmental Advocates, a nonprofit group, said Mr. Zagata's policies mean polluters \"will get one free bite at the apple.\" Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly Environmental Committee, attacked Mr. Zagata for allowing Mr. Pataki to make budget cuts that he said would gut the agency's enforcement abilities.    Mr. Zagata, 52, is a native New Yorker who speaks with a Texas twang developed during 14 years working as an environmental manager in Houston for oil and natural gas companies. There, he pioneered a concept known as mitigation banking, which allows companies to earn permits for building on protected wetlands by first expanding existing wetlands. He said he planned a similar policy for New York State, starting with state highway projects.    In 1994, he lost his job as vice president of environmental affairs for Transco Energy during a corporate downsizing, and was hired by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to be the Environmental Conservation Department's liaison to business.    He holds a doctorate in wildlife ecology, has worked as a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society and has taught wildlife resources at the University of Maine.    Born in the tiny rural town of West Davenport, Mr. Zagata is an outdoorsman whose office walls are hung with photographs of him hunting and fishing. Though he is only 5 feet 8 inches tall, he is a former football tackle who clearly takes some pride in his toughness.    He recalls, for instance, being rapped on the knuckles by his parochial-school teachers whenever he wrote left-handed. Today, Mr. Zagata remains a proud and unrepentant southpaw with a pen.    \"Every time they hit me, I'd go home and practice with my left hand,\" he recalled with a smile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/nyregion/c-corrections-556095.html","abstract":"  A chart in Business Day on Thursday with an article about a new low-sugar cola announced by the Pepsi-Cola Company carried an erroneous scale.

The hapless characters also lacked the crowns and gowns and accouterments of ersatz medievalism.    The entire opera took place between the decaying walls of a classical mansion designed by John Conklin, with draped statues and crates, a leafless tree, empty picture frames and creaky scaffolding. There was no outside or inside, only a disintegrating world on the verge of abandonment. The walls slowly rotated with each instrumental interlude, so that even the sets seemed to breathe along with James Levine's supple conducting.

They get only six or seven hours of sleep, instead of eight or nine, which adds up to a whole night lost every week.\n\nLack of sleep is a national disease, responsible for everything from our dismal job performance to our rotten sex lives. A Government report last year estimated that sleepy drivers were responsible for one-third of all fatal accidents, or 10,000 deaths a year.

From what they left behind and from the configurations of their tiny stone cities, we have guessed that the people were tiny, that they ate corn and sheep, that life was communal, egalitarian and precarious.   Keet Seel and Betatakin, ruins of two villages built into the cliffs of Navajo National Monument Park in northern Arizona, are among the most remote and best preserved of the Anasazi ruins. Though the stonework lacks the precision of the walls at Chaco Canyon, in New Mexico, and the kivas (ceremonial rooms) and rock art are less elaborate, the settings -- giant alcoves in sandstone cliffs inaccessible by road -- are spectacular. Because of the shelter of the alcoves and the difficulty of getting there, much of both villages, even the stick-and-mud roofs, is intact, and potsherds, arrowheads, corncobs and sheep vertebrae can still be found on the ground.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Behind the Scenes At 2 Top Bakeries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/behind-the-scenes-at-2-top-bakeries.html","abstract":"IN a gritty section of Jersey City, Uni-Bake sits in a low building surrounded by auto body shops.

A peninsula connected to the rest of Tasmania by only a 400-yard-wide isthmus, and separated from mainland Australia by 250 miles of ocean, Port Arthur was for nearly 50 years the last stop for incorrigibles in the British penal system. But 100 years after the last prisoner left Port Arthur, and 15 years after the start of a concerted effort to restore the site, the former penal colony is now Tasmania's No. 1 tourist attraction -- last year it was visited by more than 180,000 people. On a late summer day, when the sun shines brilliantly on the lush green fields that cover the prison grounds and reflects off the sailboats in the surrounding waters, it is hard to believe Port Arthur was the setting for some of the harshest discipline meted out since the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nI began my journey, as did most of the convicts sentenced to spend time there, in Hobart, Tasmania's capital. The prison site is an hour's drive away through landscapes reminiscent of the English countryside. Several of the towns on the route have hedge mazes; others have tearooms and craft shops. I took care to heed the many signs warning that kangaroos and wallabies are constantly crossing the road. But not every marsupial is as lucky as the ones I avoided hitting on my visit last March.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Louis Armstrong to Remain a Magnet School","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-elmhurst-louis-armstrong-to-remain-a-magnet-school.html","abstract":"  In a decision announced Friday, a judge in Queens has ruled against the Parents Association at an overcrowded intermediate school in Jackson Heights that had filed suit to have a nearby magnet school, run by the central Board of Education, placed under the local district's control.

One of the largest, spookiest, most legend-enshrouded and least known to foreign visitors is the Spessart -- 800 square miles of wooded hill country east of Frankfurt, tucked between bends of the Main River and one of its tributaries, the Kinzig. \n\nThe Spessart, Hessian-Franconian vernacular for Spechtswald, which means \"woodpecker forest,\" gained notoriety in the 19th century through the novelist Wilhelm Hauff's stories about highway robbers who waylaid travelers and had their hideouts there in isolated inns. The bandits were not fiction, for highway robbery was once a plague in these woods, though Hauff, a fervid romantic, depicted them as Teutonic versions of Robin Hood and made their lairs seem eerily frightening.\n\nThe Grimm brothers, brought up in Steinau, one of the forest's most picturesque towns, used the Spessart as the setting for many of their fairy tales. Those, locals insist, were not all fiction either.  Today the lore serves as enchanting background to one of Germany's most rewarding and relaxing travel destinations. It can be explored in four to five days with about 200 miles of driving, primarily on scenic country roads, between the principal sights. For business visitors it is also an ideal long weekend out of Frankfurt, which is only 45 miles from the heart of the Spessart.\n\nMiltenberg, population 9,500, is a good starting point and base for discovering the forest's southern -- Bavarian -- part and the wine country around the gently flowing Main, which has become a major artery for barges carrying freight between the North and Black Seas since opening of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992. The town is also a port for leisurely excursion-boat trips along the river. Much of the red sandstone, characteristic of the Spessart's architecture, is quarried at and around Miltenberg.\n\nMiltenberg was a Roman military base as early as A.D. 160, but its golden era was the 14th through 16th centuries, thanks to the prince-archbishops of Mainz, who built Miltenburg Castle, which is spelled differently. The castle, which stands on the steepest hill overlooking the town, served both as a border point and customs station to levy duty on the traffic on the river. \n\nMost of the half-timbered, steep-roofed houses of its medieval merchants, craftsmen, sandstone quarriers and wine dealers still line the narrow, cobblestone main street that curves for almost a mile between the river and the densely wooded hillside. \n\nA seven-mile drive south from Miltenberg and the Main leads to Amorbach and a startling change of architectural eras: from Gothic and Renaissance to late Baroque, due mainly to this small town's beautiful Abbey Church.\n\nAmorbach and its abbey were founded in 734 by Irish Benedictines who played a key role in Christianizing the Germans. In 1734, while celebrating the monastery's millenium, the Mainz archbishop decided to replace the whole Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic complex with one in the Baroque style, which was then fashionable. \n\nThe architect, Maximilian von Welsch, retained famous stucco and fresco artists such as Johann Feichtmayr and Matthaus Gunther to do the interior decorating. It took only seven years to complete the opulent, eye-dazzling ensemble. The monks capped it with a new organ, which has almost 5,000 pipes and 63 registers.\n\nThe glory of Amorbach ended in 1803 when Napoleon redrew the map of Europe.  He abolished the German church-states, secularized the abbey and gave it to the Counts of Leiningen in compensation for properties in Alsace-Lorraine that they had ceded to the French. The Leiningen family still owns and runs the complex.\n\nThe only way to see its splendid interiors -- a whirl of gilded stucco, Gunther's breathtaking ceiling frescoes of scenes from the life of St. Benedict, Feichtmayr's trompe l'oeil effects -- is on guided German-language tours that are conducted at 40-minute intervals daily March through October. They include the richly decorated abbey library with its 30,000 volumes and the Green Room, which was the abbot's reception chamber.\n\nFrom Miltenberg it is 20 winding, scenic miles northeast and upstream along the river to Wertheim, a picture postcard town of 20,000 beneath the ruins of its 11th-century castle at the confluence of the Tauber River with the Main. First mentioned in documents in 779, it was for nearly 800 years -- until 1806 -- the capital of an independent principality ruled by a succession of noble dynasties. Its partly walled old quarter is a pedestrian zone; a half-day of walking here, and a climb to the castle ruin 300 feet above the town, will take you to the most important sights. Among these are the 14th-century Collegiate Church, the Historical Museum in the former Renaissance-style City Hall and the Glass Museum.\n\nFrom the early Middle Ages until the Nazi Third Reich, Wertheim had one of the Main River valley's largest Jewish communities. But they were often the victims of persecution long before the Holocaust. One of the worst pogroms was in the early 15th century. A reminder of it is St. Mary's Chapel, a small church built in 1447 on the ruins of what had been the town's oldest synagogue. The old Jewish cemetery on the outskirts, at the base of the castle hill, has been fenced off since Germany's latest wave of neo-Nazi violence and can only be visited by applying for a key from the city administration. But at its gate there is a bronze tablet, commemorating by name the 38 Jews who were still living in Wertheim in 1942, when the Final Solution started. They were all subsequently deported to death camps.\n\nThe 21-mile drive north and upstream from Wertheim to Lohr leads through the loveliest section of the Main Valley and one of the lushest parts of the Spessart. Two hamlets along this route -- Rothenfels and Neustadt-am-Main -- merit a stop. Rothenfels was once a principal fishing and shipping center on the Main. Some 450 feet above its snug, crazily leaning half-timbered houses is a perfectly preserved 12th-century castle that nowadays serves as a youth hostel. Neustadt-am-Main, three miles farther, was founded in 769 as a Benedictine abbey. Its red sandstone basilica is a rare example of pure Romanesque architecture. The monastery, rebuilt after destruction during the Napoleonic secularization, is now the European headquarters of the Dominican order and a training center for missionary work in Africa.\n\nLohr, population 17,000, the eastern \"gate to the Spessart,\" is a picturesque maze of narrow cobblestone streets, medieval watchtowers, Gothic church spires and half-timbered houses. More important, citing research by Karlheinz Barthels, a local pharmacist and \"fabulologist,\" it maintains it is the real Snow White town. According to Barthels, she lived in Lohr's moated, turreted 14th-century castle, which now houses the Spessart Museum.\n\nThe Spessart Museum with its walk-in exhibits of life in the area centuries ago can keep you busy for hours, especially the horror chamber that describes the real highwaymen who robbed teamsters and mail coaches in the Spessart in the 1700's and early 1800's.\n\nThere are no fairy tales associated with Mespelbrunn castle, 19 miles southwest of Lohr, though it would be a perfect stage set for one. The salmon-colored Gothic-Renaissance chateau is tucked into a hilly landscape of dark, lush woods and surrounded by a broad moat. \n\nThe castle has been the property of the Counts of Ingelheim-Echter von und zu Mespelbrunn for over 500 years, and they still live in it, but they open one of the three wings to visitors daily, from March through November, except when a family event is being celebrated. \n\nThe highlights are the knights' hall with its coffered ceiling and hunting trophies, the 15th-century chapel with its beautiful stained glass windows and alabaster altar, the main dining room with its 16th-century fireplace and collection of armor and weapons and the Chinese room, crammed with Chinese and East Asian porcelain, furnishings and bric-a-brac.\n\nFrom Mespelbrunn it is 11 miles northwest to Aschaffenburg, a city of 65,000, named for the little Aschaff River, a tributary of the Main. Though its written history goes back to the seventh century, the town entered its golden era in 1260 when the prince-bishops of Mainz chose it as their second residence. It was they who built its splendid 17th-century Johannisburg Palace on a promontory overlooking the Main and who richly endowed its SS. Peter and Alexander Collegiate Church.\n\nMuch of the city was destroyed during World War II, and what little of architectural value remained was demolished by urban renewal in the 1960's.\n\nEven the massive, three-story Renaissance palace was gutted and not restored in its entirety until the 1970's. Built entirely of Miltenberg red sandstone on the ruins of an earlier archdiocesal castle, it is overwhelming in its dimensions and symmetry: four wings, each nearly 290 feet long, enclosing a 26,000 square foot courtyard, with four corner towers more than 170 feet high. The enormous building today houses a number of government offices and three major museums. The Palace Museum encompasses eight ornately furnished rooms of the Mainz archbishops and princes. The Pompeianum, in the Palace Garden, is an exact copy of a house in Pompeii, commissioned by Bavaria's King Ludwig I in 1843. This building, too, was almost totally destroyed in World War II and finally reopened -- as a museum of Roman antiquities -- in August 1994.\n\nAschaffenburg's Collegiate Church, 10 minutes' walk from the palace, is an example of late-Romanesque and early-Gothic styles from the 12th and 13th centuries. The church abounds with ecclesiastical art, including a small \"Lamentation of Christ\" by Matthias Grunewald, done when he lived in Aschaffenburg.\n\nFrom Aschaffenburg the route into the state of Hesse's section of the Spessart leads 12 miles north through Alzenau, a romantically situated town, crowned by a 14th-century castle, and from there 15 miles northwest to Gelnhausen.\n\nSet on a steep hillside above the Kinzig River, Gelnhausen looks frozen in the Middle Ages when it was one of the most important points on the main trade route between Frankfurt and Leipzig. It is a treasure trove of narrow, winding cobblestone streets lined by crazily tilting half-timbered houses, some of them almost 800 years old, and it is still partly enclosed by its medieval wall.\n\nGelnhausen was chartered in 1170 by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa after he had built a huge, partially fortified palace there on the banks of the Kinzig. The ruins of that castle with its elaborately carved Romanesque arches and capitals are among the must-see sites.\n\nThe town was booming by 1200 when work began on its St. Mary's Church, a vast red sandstone structure with four Romanesque and Gothic spires that can be seen from miles away. Among its interior furnishings are fine 13th-century stained glass windows, ornately carved choir stalls, an intricately sculptured rood screen, a polychrome high altar from 1500 and 15th-century tapestries.\n\nGelnhausen, historically, had a large and illustrious Jewish community. The most poignant reminders of this are the old cemetery down by the river bank not far from the Barbarossa castle, and the 17th-century synagogue on Brentano Strasse.\n\nBecause the synagogue had previously been secularized and forcibly sold to a non-Jew who was using it as a warehouse, it was one of the very few synagogues in Germany that escaped destruction in the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938. Now owned by the city, it was restored in 1986 and has been used since then as a cultural center, art gallery and concert hall. Its elaborately gilded, stucco-marble Torah ark is one of the few left from the Baroque period.\n\nSalt that bubbled forth from subterranean springs was one of the Spessart Forest's principal export products in the Middle Ages. One of its main sources, exploited since the 11th century, was at Bad Orb, eight miles northeast of Gelnhausen. The springs are still bubbling, but since 1837, when a local pharmacist began using the waters for medicinal purposes, the town has been a spa and health resort. Sixty thousand people converge on Bad Orb each year to take the waters; driving on 10 more miles to Steinau is more relaxing.\n\nSteinau-an-der-Strasse is where the Grimm brothers -- Jacob and Wilhelm -- who collected and wrote down all the famous fairy tales, spent their boyhood years, after their father had been appointed the local magistrate in 1791. They lived in the 16th-century Renaissance courthouse, which is now the local museum. \n\nSteinau has a history going back to about the year 700 and was chartered as a city and market place in 1290. It was an important junction on the salt and trade routes in the Middle Ages, and long a piece of real estate contested by the prince-bishops of Fulda and the counts of Hanau.\n\nWhen the Hanau counts gained control, they fortified the town and built a moated castle with walls over 90 feet high, a daunting challenge to the bandits who lurked in the Spessart. Today it ranks as one of the largest and best preserved Renaissance castles in Germany. It, too, is a museum, open daily except Mondays, with a fine collection of 15th- to 18th-century furnishings, Flemish Gobelins and a permanent exhibition of documents dealing with Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, and their younger brother Ludwig, who was an artist and provided illustrations for some of their fairy tale collections.\n\nSteinau has a vibrant cultural life as well. Central to it is the Marionettentheater, a puppet theater in the 16th-century stables of the castle. The family that runs it performs Grimm classics such as \"Snow White,\" \"Rumpelstiltskin,\" \"Cinderella,\" \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Puss in Boots\" almost daily.\nA SAMPLING OF ATTRACTIONS ALONG THE MEANDERING MAIN\nGetting There\n\n All destinations are within an hour's drive from Frankfurt or about four hours from Munich, using autobahn routes.\nGetting Around \n\nIt is advisable to take along a very detailed road map or road atlas (Shell and Aral are the best), though road signs are clear. The HB Bild Atlas No. 23 Odenwald-Spessart has very detailed maps but descriptions of the towns and destinations in German only. It is available at bookstores and gas stations in the area. \n\nThe country code for Germany is 49; when dialing a phone number within the country, the area code should be preceded with a 0.\n\nMain River boat trips are best from Miltenberg. There are round trips from Miltenberg to Wertheim on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and local excursions to the locks every hour daily, May through October: Personenschiffsreederei Henneberger, Mainanlage, D-63897 Miltenberg; telephone (9371) 3330.\nWhere to Stay \n\nAll prices include breakfast, taxes and service.\n\nMILTENBERG: Hotel zum Riesen, 97 Hauptstrasse, D-63897 Miltenberg; (9371) 3644.

Those discussions led to the formation of a civilian patrol that, at its inception, was \"well-intentioned but very green,\" said Ed Powell, who founded the group along with James Burns.    As the patrol grew, so did its visibility and its reputation as a group able to effect change. As a result, residents and community groups in Midwood and North Flatbush now rely on Umma for services ranging from ousting drug dealers from apartment buildings to helping landlords collect rent from delinquent tenants to running a day care center.    Umma seems to reach into every corner of central Brooklyn -- it trains civilian and tenant patrols, administers a playground on behalf of the Parks Department (which named the playground Umma Park after the group rid it of suspected drug dealers) and sponsors youth leadership and recreation programs. Mr. Powell himself is directly involved in several political or civic groups and is second vice chairman of Community Board 14.   Mr. Powell's political experience has paid off. Umma can call on, and get results from, such sources as the local police precinct commander and political representatives up to former Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, who donated $3,000 in equipment. In return, these sources gain a liaison with Umma's constituency, much of which has been historically distrustful of government and police.   \"Their credibility is very strong,\" said Inspector Patrick D. Brennan, commander of the 70th Precinct.   Mr. Powell and Mr. Burns concede that cooperation with government and police officials has cost them support among those who preferred the group's initial militant posture, when they patrolled the streets in military fatigues. But Mr. Powell contended that critics -- like those who denounced the group for trying to mediate a peaceful end to a well-publicized boycott against a Korean grocery store owner in late 1991 -- are \"not really from the area.\"   Within the area, residents heap praise on Umma.   \"They're doing the job most of our political people and the police should do,\" said Billy Huston, president of the Committee for a Better and Safer Nostrand Avenue, a civilian patrol in Midwood.   \"Ed and Jim probably have been more responsible for keeping Flatbush together than anyone I know,\" said Larry Jayson, associate director of the Brooklyn Tenants Council.   But with success have come potential pitfalls. As even its proponents are quick to admit, mounting expectations could force the organization either to cut back to preserve its effectiveness -- potentially alienating already disgruntled citizens -- or to concentrate more of its efforts on building a more structured organization. That, they fear, could destroy the activist, grass-roots spirit that has been at the heart of Umma's strength.    Michael Clark, executive director of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a nonprofit organization that assists and trains neighborhood groups, predicted that organizations like Umma will be called on to do more as the city trims back social services. Even though they know they may not have the resources to take on these responsibilities, Umma and other community groups often find it difficult to say no, said Mr. Clark.    Indeed, Mr. Powell and Mr. Burns relish their roles as guardians of the street. Even though they have discontinued regularly scheduled patrols, they still carry walkie-talkies in order to respond on a moment's notice to a call from one of the many patrols their organization has assisted -- although these days, calls for help tend to be less urgent. .   \"It could just be one of the seniors needs someone to go to the store,\" Mr. Powell said.

Traditionally book designers have believed that fine bindings were a book's ultimate esthetic virtue and the jacket was mere wrapping and advertising. As late as the 1950's, the American Institute of Graphic Arts refused to exhibit jackets at its annual book show. However, as Steven Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Seymour Chwast, the director of the Pushpin Group, a graphic design company, show in JACKETS REQUIRED (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), \"book jackets emerged as one of America's more vital graphic media and became a proving ground for eccentric design.\" Many of the jackets depicted in the book are creased and torn and look as if they have been moldering on shelves for decades. It is fascinating, and often surprising, to see the original jackets for contemporary favorites like \"A Farewell to Arms\" or \"Of Mice and Men\" or \"Appointment in Samarra,\" but the real standouts are more obscure items like A. H. Bolton's orange and blue design for Maximilian Foster's \"Crooked\" (1927), whose \"art moderne-inspired perspective of skyscrapers evokes the big-city life that comes shattering down on the novel's protagonist.\" It turns out that you can tell a book by its cover, as Mr. Heller and Mr. Chwast demonstrate with Eugene Thurston's jackets for the Mystery League and Alvin Lustig's for New Directions, with a stately, eerily lighted \"Paul Bunyan\" by Rockwell Kent and with such forgotten classics of shading and perspective as the jacket for \"Hacking New York\" (1930), in which \"the quintessential moderne cityscape sets the stage for the tale of a literary cabdriver.\" DAVID WALTON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Bach at Baroque Festival","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/music-bach-at-baroque-festival.html","abstract":"  THE Hoff-Barthelson Music School's 30th yearly Baroque Festival is under way in Scarsdale.

Will his G.O.P. colleagues excuse him for turning the executive power over to a Democratic lieutenant governor? Is Mr. Wilson too dull and chilly to appeal to a broader audience? What about polls that show him behind both President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole in his own state?    But the more interesting questions have to do with the threat that Mr. Wilson represents, if he can get rolling, for the other Republican Presidential aspirants and for President Clinton.

And meandering through the streets of Richmond is like stepping into the pages of a history book, from the neo-Classical domed Capitol designed by Thomas Jefferson to Shockoe Slip, a warehouse district that was ravaged by fire during the Civil War and is now a lively jumble of boutiques and bistros.\n\nRichmond is a city awash in green, from the maple- and oak-lined medians of Monument Avenue -- an elegant, 130-foot-wide boulevard studded with statues of Confederate heroes -- to the petite gardens fringing the Fan district's Victorian brownstones and pastel row houses. On warm Sunday afternoons, flower vendors dot the streets and couples meander through the city's more than 60 parks.\n\nOne of the year's most eagerly awaited events is Historic Garden Week, April 22 to 29, a statewide tour of houses and gardens. In downtown mansions and sprawling suburbs, Richmond's finest private houses welcome more than 4,000 visitors. \nEvents\n\n The Garden Club of Virginia and its 46 member clubs channel proceeds from Garden Week toward the restoration of historic gardens and grounds around the state. Next month's tour marks the 69th year for Historic Garden Week.\n\nOf the 36 tours around the state that are part of Garden Week, three (including the sole evening tour) are based in Richmond. The twilight tour, on April 27 from 6 to 9 P.M., takes visitors inside stylish town houses along downtown Franklin Street, one of the city's fanciest 19th-century addresses. You can view the majestic Jefferson Hotel, reminiscent of the Medici Palace in Florence, from a Victorian carriage and accompany costumed hostesses to a champagne reception at the Bolling Haxall House, an Italianate villa at 211 East Franklin Street. Tickets for each of the three city tours are $15, or $4 a house. They can be bought on site or by calling Garden Week headquarters at (804) 644-7776.\n\nSix 20th-century houses in the city's West End will be featured on the Hampton Gardens tour, on April 25 from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Five of the houses were built in the 1920's and 30's, and all six are open for the first time. The Westhampton tour, April 26, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., showcases seven houses and gardens, including an English cottage garden at 6331 Ridgeway Road in which a rock garden, a shade garden and an arbor are linked by millstone mosaics inlaid with pottery bits and pennies.\n\nFor a change of scenery, drive west for an hour on Interstate 64 to Charlottesville, Thomas Jefferson country. The University of Virginia's porticoed buildings and pavilion gardens were designed by Jefferson and restored by the Garden Club. On April 27, free tours of the Rotunda, gardens and pavilion houses will be conducted from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. At Monticello, three miles southeast of Charlottesville on Route 53, learn about the founding father's passion for gardening at a free tour of the Monticello garden restorations on April 25 and 27 at 2 P.M. Information: (804) 984-9822.\n\nAnother sort of tour -- the Tour duPont, an American version of the Tour de France -- will roll through Richmond on April 28. The 12-day bicycle race, with 18 teams of 7 riders each, declares a winner at the end of each day's race as well as an overall winner at the end. The racers should cross the Richmond finish line, at the intersection of 10th and Cary Streets, on the first of three downtown laps at about 6 P.M. There is a post-race concert in nearby Shockoe Slip Plaza. For more information about this free event, as well as the race, call (804) 782-2777.\n\nShockoe Slip's more permanent residents are the galleries and eclectic craft stores lining its streets and those of Carytown, a nine-block area of quaint shops. Arts in the Park is a show that attracts more than 400 painters, woodworkers, glass blowers and sculptors on May 6 and 7 in Byrd Park. Free admission. Information: (804) 353-8198.\n\nThat same weekend visitors can taste the fruits of the labors of 22 Virginia wineries at the James River Wine Festival. They can sample more than 100 wines, take home a souvenir wine glass, learn the proper way to taste wine and enjoy live jazz for $12 ($10 in advance) on Brown's Island, a grassy isle in the middle of the James River in the heart of Richmond. Contact: (804) 359-4645.\n\nThe wine festival is a prelude to the Taste of Richmond, May 19 to 21, which features the delicacies of more than 30 restaurants. Children (and adults) can step up to the tent that sells sandwiches made from Virginia-produced peanut butters and jellies. Admission to the festival on Brown's Island is $3, and meals range from 50 cents to $3.50. Information: (800) 893-2475.\nSightseeing\n\n Inside the white wooden frame of St. John's Episcopal Church, 2401 East Broad Street, (804) 648-5015, Patrick Henry delivered his legendary incitement to rebellion: \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" Tours ($3, students $1) are given every 30 minutes from 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. daily, except Sunday, when they start at 1. There are re-enactments of Henry's speech to the Second Virginia Convention (Washington and Jefferson attend in bewigged splendor) on Sundays starting Memorial Day weekend.\n\nMaymont, 1700 Hampton Street, (804) 358-7166, a 100-acre Victorian estate, boasts a meticulously decorated mansion that looks out over immaculately groomed lawns and Italian and Japanese gardens teeming with exotic flowers. A children's farm and natural wildlife habitat for bison, elk and black bears is reached from the Spottswood Road entrance. You can ride a tram to see the many sites or take a turn-of-the-century horse-drawn carriage. Admission is free, but a $3 donation is suggested for the house tours (not offered on Mondays). Tram and carriage rides cost $2. The grounds, including the habitat, are open daily from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. \n\nThe wrought-iron gates of Hollywood Cemetery, 412 South Cherry Street, (804) 648-8501, guard the tombs of more than 18,000 Civil War dead, including those of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, and the generals J.

The diseased brain, the mind that is feverishly alert or in a deep perceptual slumber, and the body that struggles to contain them: this is the spectacle that the British director Peter Brook puts before us in his rich and strange theater piece \"The Man Who,\" an adaptation of the neurologist Oliver Sacks's book of case studies \"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.\"   Dr. Sacks likes to call his studies stories or clinical tales, for he sees his patients as figures of myth besieged by powerful forces. \"Classical fables have archetypal figures -- heroes, victims, martyrs, warriors,\" he writes in his book's preface. \"Neurological patients are all of these.\" They are travelers to unimaginable lands who have brought their stories back to civilization, tales as fabulous as anything found in \"The Odyssey,\" \"The Arabian Nights\" or \"The Mahabharata,\" the vast Hindu epic that Mr. Brook staged eight years ago.

Ms. Ameling is one of the most admired -- and the very most recorded -- of female song recitalists, and she is 62.

Some have suggested that it would be best to take away the art and leave the museum as a monument to its architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. It's true that Wright's design often doesn't display art to excellent advantage. But occasionally a show comes along in which art and architecture reinforce each other, creating the unified experience Wright envisioned. For me, the Guggenheim's current retrospective of paintings by Ross Bleckner is such a show. I found the whole experience very moving, not least because it prompted me to reflect on how a viewer's personal history and emotions effect the response to visual art.   The show dredged up a memory from my adolescence, when I imagined that I faced a choice. It seemed to me that there were people who let themselves feel things, and others who didn't, and I wanted to belong to the first group. Did I really have a choice? Or was I just discovering who I was?

When Mr. Whitley wrote its songs, he was working in a Brooklyn factory, with neither the time nor the resources to form a band.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"The Good Fight","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/sports/l-the-good-fight-075595.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:  Joe Lapointe's column on fighting in hockey (\"Hand Over Fist, Fighting Surges in the N.H.L.,\" The Times, March 12) made some good points but erred by omission.    Lapointe used statistics to show that fighting increased last season and continues to increase this season. While the average fights per game were up last season, the increase only reached the level from two seasons earlier, and the normal pattern of fighting prevailed, with a high rate in the early season that then tailed off. That suggests the decrease in the 1992-93 season was an aberration. Any statistics this season must be viewed as distinct, due to the shortened schedule and intraconference scheduling that increases the importance of each game and intensified rivalries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"A Glorious Fusion of East and West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/dining-out-a-glorious-fusion-of-east-and-west.html","abstract":"  ORIENTAL and Occidental fuse beautifully at Baang Cafe and Bar, just south of Exit 5 of Interstate 95 in Riverside.

The decor at Baang (which means to tie together in Chinese) jumps and vibrates with colors and an eclecticism that reminded us of Wolfgang Puck's Chinoise on Main in Santa Monica.

The year 1868 saw the premieres of Brahms's \"German Requiem\" and Wagner's \"Meistersinger,\" works that helped establish their composers' reputations in perpetuity. Brahms has come down to us as the staunch conservative who upheld Classical traditions, Wagner as the modernist apostle of innovation. This simplistic opposition needs to be not only deconstructed but stood on its head. Brahms may well have been the more modern and forward-looking of the two.\n\nAt first blush the Requiem, which forms the centerpiece of the New York Philharmonic's celebration of Brahms's choral music this week, seems little more than a somber oratorio with death as its theme. (\"You feel at once,\" sniped George Bernard Shaw, that perfect Wagnerite, \"that it could only have come from the establishment of a first-class undertaker.\") \"Meistersinger\" is by contrast an operatic paean to the future of love, life and art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"For 20 Years Taproot Has Had Fine Writers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/l-for-20-years-taproot-has-had-fine-writers-257495.html","abstract":"  I am writing to correct a number of errors regarding the Taproot Workshops and Journal in the interview with Claire Nicolas White in \"Encounters, From an Autobiography, Tales That Echo\"  [ Feb. 19 ] . For 20 years Taproot has reached elder writers in all occupations and professions who wish to set down their experience in permanent form. The organization was not, as the article indicates, founded specifically as a poetry program or a project for semilliterate farm workers or nursing homes.   Taproot writers are first-hand witnesses of the war in Afghanistan, survivors of the Holocaust and dwellers in rural Long Island. They write in whatever genre they choose -- fiction, essay, memoir, verse -- for this creativity is the flowering of their own age. We have never yet held a workshop for farm workers, although the idea is a fascinating one. Taproot was founded in 1974 by Laura Fox. Claire Nicolas White did not become a member of the Taproot board until 10 years later. However she was one of the organization's finest teachers, and would be welcome in that capacity again at any time. I am at a loss to understand, as are a number of our members, how Taproot's organizational purpose is viewed as \"blurred.\" We have only begun to fulfill our original bylaws.
