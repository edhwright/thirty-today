But former Communists in eastern Germany did better than expected on their old turf, winning a surprising 40 percent in what used to be East Berlin.    The European Parliament has only limited powers and is far from being the legislative seat of a true European Union. But these elections offer a useful barometer of political shifts.

These tips for both city and suburban commuters were compiled from the Transit Authority, the New York City Transportation Department, and consumer transportation advocates. Leave early or late. The best times for getting a morning subway train are between 5 and 6 A.M., and between 9 and 10 A.M. The worst time is between 8 and 9 A.M. Going home, the best times are between 3 and 4 P.M., and between 7 and 8 P.M. The worst is from 5 to 6 P.M. Avoid the E and F subway lines from Jamaica to midtown Manhattan. These express lines, which generally provide the fastest and most convenient service to midtown, are already the most crowded in the city. Though they are the easiest to reach for many Long Island commuters, the Transit Authority is urging suburbanites to look elsewhere.   If you insist on heading to the first stations on the E, F or 7 lines, prepare to wait outside the stations until the police let you down the stairs. To keep masses of riders from holding open train doors, officers will be \"metering\" the crowds by restricting access to the platforms. Metering will also take place in the afternoons at the Fifth Avenue and Lexington Avenue stations on the E and F lines in Manhattan. Try the J and Z trains, which leave from Jamaica Center at Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue and head for lower Manhattan; they are generally under-used. Even if you're headed for midtown, it will be faster to take one of these trains and transfer to the uptown IRT at Chambers Street/Brooklyn Bridge. Second-best are the 7 line from Flushing to midtown and the A and C trains from southern Queens to downtown. These lines are already crowded, but not as much as the E and F trains. Charter buses ($5 from Nassau, $8 from Suffolk) will drop off Long Island commuters to the parking lots at Shea Stadium on the 7 and Kennedy International Airport on the A. Avoid transferring bewteen the 7 train and the E and F lines at 74th Street and Broadway in Queens, because there will be limited room on the trains and the police will be metering the crowds. The 7 train will be entirely local for the duration of the strike, which will mean more trains for riders at local stations but will annoy those used to an express ride.    And if the strike continues until the next day game at Shea Stadium on June 29, stay away from the stadium lot. Take local trains rather than expresses. The R train from Forest Hills to midtown will be more comfortable than the E and F trains on the same track. Subway riders in the Kew Gardens area are advised to walk or take a bus a few blocks west on Queens Boulevard to an R stop. Dress for the Tropics. Nearly all of the special buses to the Queens subway stops will be school buses without air conditioning. And there are likely to be far more people than tickets, so have a backup in mind. If you're driving in from Long Island, consider taking Jericho Turnpike, Route 25a and Sunrise Highway as alternatives to the Long Island Expressway, the Northern State Parkway and the Southern State Parkway. But be advised that less congested roads are likely to fill quickly. \"Traffic is like water, it follows the path of least resistance,\" said Melvin I. Cooperman, a State Transportation Department spokesman. Parking. Transportation officials say that if you must drive, try to leave the car in Queens of Brooklyn rather than driving into Manhattan. Long Island drivers who know Queens well can try parking on city streets near local stops on less-popular trains. Stephen Dobrow, president of the Committee for Better Transit, a consumer group, recommends driving to Astoria and taking the N train, or parking in Elmhurst or Woodside along the R line. To make these schemes easier, the city has suspended alternate-side parking in Queens and Brooklyn until the strike is over.   There are also inexpensive parking lots near Queens Center, downtown Jamaica and Queensborough Plaza that are adjacent to subway stops. But getting that far into Queens on jam-packed roads will be hard enough. And Robert Slovak, a T.A. spokesman, advises commuters not to cruise the streets of Queens aimlessly looking for a space. \"Take a map,\" he suggests. Don't think about Monday, Thursday and Friday will probably be bad but next week will probably be worse. Those who can skip work today and tomorrow will probably rejoin the commute by then.

The American plan would require United Nations members to halt all trading in arms with North Korea, a move that could cost it between $50 million and $100 million a year in lost exports. But North Korea's arms exports are mostly missiles sent to Iran and Syria, two countries with spotty records of compliance with United Nations directives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940616","headline":"At This Year's Open, 'Whoa' Is the Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/16/sports/golf-at-this-year-s-open-whoa-is-the-word.html","abstract":"  The United States Open is arguably the most difficult championship in the world to win, but there is one point on which there is very little argument as it gets under way at Oakmont Country Club on Thursday.

Unfortunately for the current state of the art, the best of them, Bill Hicks, is no longer around. He died of cancer in February. He was 32.   Mr. Hicks was not the average one-liner type of comedian. He told what the critic John Lahr of The New Yorker described as \"jokes to kill,\" most of them scathing observations on American icons and institutions (George Bush and the Persian Gulf war were among his choicer targets). That may explain why he was less popular in his own country than in Britain, winning the top award at the 1990 Edinburgh Comedy Festival and doing his last major television special in Britain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940617","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/style/chronicle-423432.html","abstract":"  PRESIDENT CLINTON, the target of jokes for wearing skimpy jogging shorts that reveal pale legs, unveiled more conservative garb on his morning run yesterday.

This perfect re-creation of a Paris brasserie is not of this time or this place.   Unless, of course, David Caruso, star of \"N.Y.P.D.

Thus far, the tobacco giant has been able to swat away complaints that the tuxedo-clad, piano-playing, sunglasses-sporting Joe Camel -- a \"smooth character\" in English-speaking neighborhoods, \"un tipo suave\" for Spanish speakers -- is a cynical attempt to charm, and hook, impressionable children.
