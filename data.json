An eccentric but absorbing mixture of documentary, fantasy and polemic, the film uses the image of hundreds of penguins marching stolidly across the frozen desert of Antarctica as a metaphor for nature's alarm at human cruelty and pollution. Moving in solemn processional columns, their chests puffed, their beaks raised high, the penguins look like nothing so much as a bunch of 17-century Pilgrims convening an emergency council to discuss the future of their colony.   Expanding on the notion of birds sitting in judgment on humans is the conversation that the Swiss film maker, who wrote the film with Franz Hohler, imagines the penguins are having with one another. As interpreted by the film's unseen narrator, their alarmed clucks and cries are a collective outcry against the arrival of a party of climate researchers. The penguins, he suggests, share a collective memory of a time earlier in the century when a whaling outpost on South Georgia Island polluted their habitat and threatened their very existence. To help fuel the outpost's processing plants, thousands of live penguins were fed into their furnaces. The film implicitly compares the torching of penguins with the horrors of the Nazi death camps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"Clinton's Luck Takes Upturn On Duck Hunt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/us/clinton-s-luck-takes-upturn-on-duck-hunt.html","abstract":"  A world away from the drained swamp that is Washington, President Clinton toted a borrowed shotgun into a flooded soybean field before dawn today and emerged three hours later bearing two dead ducks and a political message: assault weapons are bad, but banning them doesn't impede hunting, which is a good all-American sport.   \"I really started feeling like a person when I was about five minutes out on the water today,\" Mr. Clinton said with a grin after the outing on a friend's farm near Cotton Plant, about 80 miles northeast of here.

There are no brain-breaking themes, cosmic truths or moral lessons here, only a featherweight love story and a florid score that, when sung and played as well as it was on Monday, seems to float effortlessly through the sets and out into the house. There were a few needlessly silly touches: soldiers who marched backward and did peculiar dance steps, for example. But for the most part Elizabeth Bachman's staging was direct and traditional.

The play dates from a time when Goldoni was struggling to transport Venetian theater from the commedia dell'arte's wild improvisations on a bare scenario to the performance of fully written plays, and it has remnants of the commedia's slapstick along with an arsenal of tricks Goldoni devised to grab an audience's attention. The Pearl's version is wonderfully fresh, even if its exuberance at times reminds one of some stage experiments of the 1960's.   Mr. Rando and the actors approach Goldoni's contorted plot with the boisterous humor the playwright intended, often mocking it in asides to the audience, which he also wanted. There are elaborate schemes over a horde of jewels and gold, sword fights, fistfights, love duets, seduction attempts, flirtations with incest, battles with the law and endless confusions of identity, especially between twin brothers who have not seen each other in many years and who turn up in the same town on the same day.

Although the most vocal opposition to domestic partnerships is aimed at gay couples, giving them benefits doesn't undermine marriage.  Rather, it remedies the injustice that homosexuals can't marry the people with whom they share their lives, and it creates financial incentives for stable relationships.

Giuliani said yesterday that there would be a shortfall in tax revenues for the fourth quarter of 1994. Although the Mayor said it was too soon to determine the amount, administration officials said the shortfall would be at least $200 million and would certainly lead to even more budget cuts.    That shortfall comes on top of a budget gap that administration officials have already estimated at between $200 million and $500 million for the fiscal year that ends in June. And it comes after the administration took the unusual step of imposing nearly $800 million in spending cuts by impounding funds to keep its $31.6 billion budget in balance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950105","headline":"North America to See Casals Festival Concert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/arts/television-review-north-america-to-see-casals-festival-concert.html","abstract":"  Just in time for tourist season, the Arts & Entertainment Network's \"Stage\" series presents the \"38th Annual Pablo Casals Festival\" tonight in what is being billed as the first North American concert telecast of this prestigious event in Puerto Rico.

Raised in Catalonia, not far from Barcelona, he had fled Franco's Spain in the 1930's and become an ardent opponent of fascism. His ties to Puerto Rico were through his mother, who was born there. The festival's first concert was held on April 22, 1957. Casals performed a cello solo by Bach; his guest, the pianist Rudolf Serkin, offered Mozart and Schubert selections.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950105","headline":"Sports of The Times; 'Three-peat' Lore Haunts The Cowboys","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/sports/sports-of-the-times-three-peat-lore-haunts-the-cowboys.html","abstract":"  IT has usually been injuries or the aging of the best players, if not both.

Although the New York region shows few signs of sinking back into recession, the experts say the local economy remains one of the weakest in the nation, when business activity elsewhere is so robust that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since February to ward off inflation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950106","headline":"Bombing of Rebel City Lets Up, But Not the Attacks on Yeltsin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/world/bombing-of-rebel-city-lets-up-but-not-the-attacks-on-yeltsin.html","abstract":"  There were reports today of a respite in the bombing of the embattled capital of Chechnya, as ordered by Boris N. Yeltsin. But it brought no reprieve to the Russian President, who remains under attack at home and abroad for his military offensive against the secessionist southern region.    Western press reports from Grozny, the rebel capital, supported Russia's claim that bombing was limited to the outskirts of town, but Russian reports contradicted it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950106","headline":"The G.O.P. Squeeze on New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/opinion/the-gop-squeeze-on-new-york.html","abstract":"  In his first speech as House Speaker, Newt Gingrich smoothly portrayed the Republicans' \"Contract With America\" as an uplifting program for the nation. But tranquilizing rhetoric cannot mask the program's potential harm for a city that already exports more Federal tax dollars than it gets back. That powerful message emerges from a report, issued by Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, that provides rough estimates of the impact of G.O.P. spending cuts on the residents of New York City. The chilling numbers document an obligation to protect their constituents that now falls on members of the city's Congressional delegation, especially Alfonse D'Amato, New York's influential Republican Senator.   Mr. Schumer makes a straightforward calculation. To fulfill the contract's pledge to balance the Federal budget and cut taxes, Congress would have to cut about $350 billion out of the budget in the year 2002. But the contract would exempt Social Security, defense and interest on the national debt, thus drastically narrowing the places to find the money. It means Congress would have to chop 30 percent out of all the non-exempt programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950106","headline":"European Lifestyles in the Skies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/style/IHT-european-lifestyles-in-the-skies.html","abstract":"CONSUMER research has many functions, such as finding the need for more research, to prove pretty well anything you want, or simply to rediscover the obvious.

The first Republican governor in 20 years, he faces a split Legislature, with a solid Democratic majority in the House and a new but slim Republican majority in the Senate. Indeed, Democrats gained more House seats in Connecticut in the November elections than anywhere else in the country. If Mr. Rowland really means to repeal the state income tax -- his principal campaign promise -- he is going to need help.    Mr. Rowland heaped praise on his predecessor, the maverick independent Lowell Weicker, who defeated him in 1990. He promised compassion, \"to help our young and old, our ill and afflicted, when they need help and have no other resources.\" And, attentive to urban deterioration in Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven as well as smaller cities, he implored \"each and every civic-minded resident\" of the state to help revive them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950106","headline":"Results Plus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/sports/results-plus-442095.html","abstract":"  N.B.A.  Spurs Win Squeaker  David Robinson scored 25 points and Sean Elliott added 20, including two free throws to decide the outcome with 4.6 seconds to play, as San Antonio defeated Utah, 104-103, last night in Salt Lake City for its 10th victory in 11 games.

Manila is the world's most densely populated city proper, with 43,611.5 inhabitants per square kilometer (112,953/sq mi) and a population of 1,846,513 people in 2020; it is also the historic core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its administrative limits and includes some 24 million people. Manila was the first chartered city in the country, designated by Philippine Commission Act No. 183 on July 31, 1901. It became autonomous with the passage of Republic Act No. 409, \"The Revised Charter of the City of Manila\", on June 18, 1949. Manila is considered to be part of the world's original set of global cities because its commercial networks were the first to extend across the Pacific Ocean and connect Asia with the Spanish Americas through the galleon trade.
