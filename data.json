The occasion is \"Preview: Nara Convention Hall International Design Competition.\" On view are 10 finalists' schemes for a convention hall for the city of Nara, Japan. Organized and beautifully installed by Terence Riley, the department's new director, the models and drawings make a smart if visually frosty display, and they hint at possible shifts in the climate of taste. But there's a good chance the show will drift away without making an impact. The issues it raises lie largely submerged.   The convention hall is one element in Silk Road 21, an ambitious master plan to revitalize one of Japan's oldest cities. Designed by Kisho Kurokawa, the plan includes housing, health clinics, a sports complex, a museum, a new train station and a bus terminal, each to be designed by a different architect. The convention hall's site is pivotal, not only because it is adjacent to the city's rail gateway, but also because it occupies the meeting place of Nara's two street grids. Of modest size by American standards, the hall is to include three auditoriums of different sizes and flexible configurations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Not a Happy Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/sports/sports-people-football-not-a-happy-day.html","abstract":"  Auburn students and supporters verbally assailed a former football player, ERIC RAMSEY, when he and his wife walked across a stage to collect their diplomas Wednesday.

His 1991 film, \"Scream of Stone,\" begins with the hilarious absurdity of indoor mountain-climbing as a televised sport. In a studio, two world-class mountaineers literally climb the walls, with Donald Sutherland giving the play-by-play. Soon a middle-aged champion and his arrogant young challenger agree to race to the top of a killer mountain in Patagonia. Brad Dourif, as the most space-shot climber of all, pops in and insists he has already been there. \"I dedicated my climb to Mae West,\" he says. \"They say she's dead, but she's not. She owns a beauty parlor.\" He gets the last word with the film's funny final turn.   Although it has dull patches and laughable moments of seriousness, this new film is a link to the dazzling old Herzog, who seemed to have disappeared. It offers spectacular photography of the treacherous, icy climb and characters who are as gloriously demented as the heroes of \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" or \"Fitzcarraldo\" (the forays into the South American jungle that brought the director his widest acclaim).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"On My Mind; Toys or Torture","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/opinion/on-my-mind-toys-or-torture.html","abstract":"  At the end, President Bush had one fine political opportunity left.

We ought to look at another solution: let all charities engage in limited political activity.   Charities (including churches and religious organizations) are now permitted to engage in a limited amount of lobbying, which is defined as advocating the passage or defeat of legislation. They are absolutely prohibited, however, from advocating the election or defeat of candidates. This means charities cannot endorse candidates, donate money to them or engage in overtly partisan activities. Nonpartisan voter education and get-out-the-vote activities are permitted if in compliance with strict guidelines. Organizations that violate the rules can have their tax-exempt status revoked, and their managers are subject to fines and penalties if the violations are found to be willful.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Sleeping Easy in Manhattan for $150 or Less","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/arts/sleeping-easy-in-manhattan-for-150-or-less.html","abstract":"Contrary to popular notion, it is possible to find clean, comfortable hotel accommodations in Manhattan for $70 to $150 a night without having to share a bathroom or make your own bed.

The 16-nation body did not indicate how it would help enforce the ban, but Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that NATO was preparing contingency plans to enforce the no-flights zone and that the United States was prepared to provide aircraft in such an operation.   Options ranged from overflights to what Mr. Eagleburger called \"more muscular measures.\" He acknowledged that if the ban is enforced, it could put United Nations troops at risk of retaliation and that it was a \"possibility\" that they might be forced to withdraw, at least temporarily.  Warning to U.N.    The NATO decision came as the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, warned that United Nations troops in Bosnia may be attacked if Western nations attempt to enforce the ban on flights.   The Serbs are reported to have violated the ban on flights 225 times since it was imposed in October. But there is no proof that they have resumed combat missions.   NATO has already contributed personnel and equipment to the United Nations peackeeping operation in the Balkans, and its ships are in the Adriatic, helping to enforce a blockade. NATO reconnaissance aircraft are providing data on violations of the flight ban.   On another issue, Mr. Eagleburger warned Ukraine that its relationship with the United States will suffer if it continues to delay ratification of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the strategic arms reduction treaty slashing the arsenals of nuclear weapons in the United States and the former Soviet republics. The Ukrainian Foreign Minsiter, Anatoly Zlenko, told Mr. Eagleburger earlier in the week that the Kiev Parliament would not take up the issue until January at the earliest.   Mr. Eagleburger said he made clear during the meeting that the United States \"is not particularly happy with the delays,\" adding that he expected \"ratification and without reservations,\" and if progress is delayed much longer it will \"inevitably have an impact\" on the two countries' relations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Council Backs New Board To Review Police Conduct","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/nyregion/council-backs-new-board-to-review-police-conduct.html","abstract":"  The City Council voted overwhelmingly last night to establish an all-civilian agency to investigate police misconduct, ending for now a racially charged debate that has polarized the city several times since the idea was first proposed in the 1960's.

Over the last week, we visited six Santas around Manhattan and had extremely varied experiences with each. Some we spoke to. Some we simply observed.

A documentary film about black G.I.'s liberating Jewish concentration camp prisoners during World War II brought an audience of 1,200 blacks and Jews to tears. They spoke of common ground, embraced and passionately agreed that together, they had experienced a rare, powerful moment -- a catharsis in the increasingly hostile relations between blacks and Jews in New York City.    But in the colder light of day, many wondered whether theirs was a lasting epiphany on race relations or a moment as fleeting as it was strongly felt. And yesterday, unlike the night before, not everyone could agree. Some considered the evening at the Apollo a turning point, while others feared the truce would be about as permanent as those jaunty waves across the trenches between British and German soldiers in the early days of World War I.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"New Work Corps Could Change People's Lives; California-Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/opinion/l-new-work-corps-could-change-people-s-lives-california-style-630092.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Stephen Ambrose's suggestion to create a 1990's version of the Civilian Conservation Corps (Op-Ed, Nov. 28) certainly caught our attention.

Today, stung by the embarrassing case of a Suffolk County school official who was granted a nearly $1 million retirement package, some of the same senators announced they were proposing new measures to \"provide greater accountability\" for certain school districts, set legal limits on compensation and provide a \"full 'plain-language' disclosure\" on how much their top school officials are paid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/arts/classical-music-in-review-671892.html","abstract":"  Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center  Tully Hall   The big news at the Chamber Music Society's concert on Sunday afternoon was the world premiere of Fred Lerdahl's \"Marches\" for clarinet, violin, cello and piano. In a note, the composer aptly described his work as a \"hallucination of marches through a labyrinthine landscape\"; the influence of Gustav Mahler, an obsessive aficionado of marches, hung heavily but not oppressively over the score.  Mr. Lerdahl set a variety of conflicting events into motion and fluidly coordinated their intermingling.  What seemed to be missing was a contemporary tone, some indication that this collage emanated from 1992 rather than 1902 or 1932. The performance by David Shifrin, Ani Kavafian, Fred Sherry and Lee Luvisi was alert and persuasive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"Arming Inmates for Life To Pay Back a Promise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/nyregion/about-new-york-arming-inmates-for-life-to-pay-back-a-promise.html","abstract":"  FIVE years ago, when Fernando Mateo was 29, he promised God that if He helped him prosper as a carpeting dealer and contractor, he would do something to help poor people in prison.   \"It's a Dominican tradition -- we call it 'la promesa,' \" said Mr. Mateo, a high school dropout, who has been making good on his vow. \"Some people promise to wear white for five years or wear black; me, I promised to provide vocational training and jobs for people in jail.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"New Work Corps Could Change People's Lives; Include Human Services","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/opinion/l-new-work-corps-could-change-people-s-lives-include-human-services-629792.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The infrastructures and environment of our country can be helped by such a corps as Stephen E.

But the Columbus quincentennial has also focused attention on the contemporaneous expulsion, an event commemorated by a flourishing of Sephardic music concerts. Voice of the Turtle, an ensemble that has specialized in this repertory since 1978, presented a few dozen songs, leavened with a couple of folk tales, in a Hanukkah concert on Sunday afternoon at Symphony Space.   Actually, the program's connection with Hanukkah was tenuous: only the first and last groups of songs referred to the holiday. The greater part of the program was devoted to love songs, nostalgic reminiscences of Spain, allegorical Bible stories and songs about the concerns, both grand and trivial, of daily life. The settings were in Ladino, a dialect in which Hebrew and medieval Spanish are intermingled, the Sephardic counterpart of Yiddish.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/arts/classical-music-in-review-670092.html","abstract":"  Benedetto Lupo  Pianist Alice Tully Hall    Benedetto Lupo won a bronze medal at the 1989 Van Cliburn Competition; the Van Cliburn Foundation sponsored his New York debut recital on Monday night, a prelude to the next competition in the spring and summer.

Mr. Zorn has always been fascinated by and suspicious of music's ability to suggest mood; most of his pieces jump from texture to texture, idiom to idiom, almost as soon as each one registers, as if refusing to manipulate the listener. But Mr. Zorn has also composed atmospheric pieces like \"Spillane,\" a soundtrack without a detective movie. The six sections of \"Kristallnacht\" use both fragmentation and longer dramatic arcs, yet with a pervasive mood of mourning and determination.    Before the performance there were recordings of bouncy 1930's cabaret songs and then, for about 15 minutes, the sounds of a train journey; standing in the dark, packed Knitting Factory on Wednesday night, it was easy to recognize an allusion to the sealed trains that carried people to concentration camps. When the seven musicians arrived on stage, wearing yellow six-pointed stars, the first movement, \"Shtetl (Ghetto Life)\" was a montage with phrases of klezmer music (from Frank London on trumpet, Mark Feldman on violin and David Krakauer on clarinet) -- the echoes of a vanished community -- amid glassy guitar sounds (Marc Ribot) and droning bass (Mark Dresser).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/style/chronicle-212792.html","abstract":"  GINGER ROGERS dancing without Fred Astaire?

Rectangular, 35-millimeter pictures focus on pink cherry blossoms (\"sakura\"); they hang next to dark, nearly square photographs of plastics washed up on the beach.

The damaged environment beckons seductively; the prodigious displays of spring harbor hints of darkness.   His work, which in the late 1950's and 60's influenced such Japanese artists as the film maker Akira Kurosawa, has a certain authority and reserved elegance but breaks no new ground. In the cherry-tree pictures, blossom and branch, seen close on, choke the surface with a vigorous, wiry calligraphy the Abstract Expressionists would have admired.

Since ancient times, Indians have fashioned jewelry and religious artifacts from turquoise and shells, which signify sky and water, growth and renewal. With the introduction of silversmithing, modern tools and a greater variety of materials, Dexter Cirillo writes, younger artists are going far beyond traditional designs and are creating works of singular beauty and technical sophistication. Ms. Cirillo, an independent curator and dealer, discusses such influential earlier figures as Kenneth Begay, a silversmith known as the father of modern Navajo jewelry, and Charles Loloma, a Hopi who perfected the sculptural inlay technique. Each tribe has a distinctive style and preferred material for jewelry, Ms. Cirillo writes; for example, the Santo Domingo Pueblo people are known for their beadwork, the Zuni for their fine stone-cutting work. Ms. Cirillo also includes a collector's guide, glossary and tips on avoiding the purchase of fraudulent pieces. Stephen Northup provides excellent photographs of the artists, but Michel Monteaux's shots of the jewelry are the true glories of the book. With his skilled use of lighting and background, Mr. Monteaux manages to bring metal, wood, stone and shell to life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/travel/q-and-a-148092.html","abstract":"  Cruising the Intracoastal   Q.

Putting their wits to the task, the    creme de la creme    of the Gypsy underworld converge on every Cadillac dealer in the San Francisco Bay area to execute a brilliant fraud that nets them 31 mint Caddys in a single day.

For originality, ingenuity and moxie, the inimitable Mr. Gores takes the Caddy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Shayna Hendel, Chaim Meiseles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/style/vows-shayna-hendel-chaim-meiseles.html","abstract":"  SHAYNA HENDEL is writing a book about why a self-described \"chicken-soup Jew\" like herself -- a Sarah Lawrence graduate, feminist and former Greenwich Village habitue -- joined the Lubavitcher Hasidim in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

He looks exactly like a bodyguard, trained in the Secret Service, which is probably where he picked up that conservative gray suit, white shirt and narrow black tie. A laconic authority figure who would die to protect the woman he loves, the hero of \"The Bodyguard\" was conceived by Lawrence Kasdan 17 years ago with Steve McQueen in mind. That -- along with the geekiest haircut this side of basic training -- helps explain why the character seems to have walked out of the past.    In \"Forever Young,\" Mel Gibson    does    walk out of the past. In 1939, he is a brave test pilot, so despondent when the woman he loves is hopelessly injured that he volunteers to be frozen as part of a top-secret experiment. He is defrosted in 1992 without losing a trace of his boyish good looks and proves that a 30's man is perfect for the 90's -- protective of women but gentle enough to cry, an eternal romantic who is also handy at home repairs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Deirdre Kane, Robert Kravitz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/style/weddings-deirdre-kane-robert-kravitz.html","abstract":"  Deirdre Kane, a recruitment coordinator at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, was married yesterday to Robert Kravitz, an associate at that firm.

She bites heartily at a pastry and dishevels her short black hair with her hands. \"I am fed up with playing 'dark-eyed' roles,\" she proclaims. \"I want to explode in a film.\"   But in \"Damage,\" starring opposite Jeremy Irons, she needs all her regards noirs. As an almost-silent object of erotic obsession, she gives away her body while her eyes -- her mind -- remain in charge. And it can be no other way. If Anna were warm, fun-loving, even lusty, she would lose her powers of control. She might break a heart or two, but she would drive no man to self-destruction. She would not be dangerous.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"How to Kill the Drama in Overtime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/sports/hockey-how-to-kill-the-drama-in-overtime.html","abstract":"  Maybe Brian Leetch turned the channel in the third period.

As pessimistic as this may sound, I feel that teaching young people moral values is a waste of the school system's time unless this education begins once a child enters kindergarten, or even earlier. By the time a child reaches middle school, any value, if any, that he or she has learned, is already embedded in his or her mind and seldom can moral values in these youths be changed.   Looking at my own school, I see that there is not a lot of moral value in my classmates or even in myself. This is not to say that my school is in moral decay, but it is typical of most schools these days. Almost everyone uses foul language; teachers are often laughed at and not taken seriously, and classroom courtesy is at an all-time low when one person is constantly interrupting another person or shooting them down with some sarcastic statement. There are those students who are obedient, respectful to their peers and teachers, but they are at a significantly lower number than those who don't.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Designer Clothes for the Pets of the Stars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/nyregion/designer-clothes-for-the-pets-of-the-stars.html","abstract":"IT wasn't Pat Henderson's new outfit at the 1981 Easter parade that drew raves, but that of Gigi, her French poodle. \n\n\"I made her a pink pleated coat, with ribbons down her ears,\" Mrs. Henderson said. \"So many people stopped and asked where they could buy her outfit, it took us two hours to go one-half block.

A few hardy travelers penetrated the anti-Western bureaucracy to visit the southern region, a land of rare wildlife, lakes and tropical ice-capped mountains. But the northern highlands, with their rich history of Christianity, remote rock churches and a culture untouched by the outside world, remained out of bounds. A devastating civil war that gathered steam after the coming to power of the Communist regime in 1974 and ended in May 1991, presented a practical obstacle. Beyond that, the hunger, poverty and repression rendered tourism an inappropriate idea. Yet those Americans who have experienced Ethiopia -- humanitarian workers, diplomats, writers and even businessmen -- have often developed a lasting affinity with a people and culture that unlike the rest of Africa refused to succumb to European colonialism.   The curtain lifted on Ethiopia when the Marxist regime collapsed and war between the Government and rebels based in Tigre province came to an end. Since then a small trickle of visitors, which the Ethiopians hope will grow in numbers, have ventured through what the Ethiopians call the historic route. It embraces the extraordinary collection of medieval rock-hewn churches at Lalibela; Aksum, the northern city where King Azane was converted to Christianity in 335; Gondar, the imperial town of castles, and Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Growing Market For Gay Travel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/travel/practical-traveler-growing-market-for-gay-travel.html","abstract":"  IN the last 10 years suppliers and opportunities for travel by gay men and women have increased enormously.

The fisherman's sweater hasn't vanished -- in fact, it's been updated in lighter weights and in a range of colors beyond the classic off-white -- but young Irish designers are working with other yarns (cotton-linen mixes, mohair, alpaca, raw silk, rayon and viscose), other patterns, other concepts and other attitudes. Instead of boat decks and north-woods cabins, their sweaters suggest cocktails on the terrace, catered picnics, disco dancing and autumn in the city. Irish cultural traditions are an abiding inspiration, but new things are being done with them.   Although there are good knitwear shops in Kerry, Clare and other counties on the scenic route, the best selection of work by young Irish designers is to be found in and around Dublin. A good place to start is the Powerscourt Townhouse Center, an 18th-century mansion about a block off Grafton Street, attractively remodeled into a shopping center. Around a glass-roofed central courtyard are many antique, gift and clothing shops, as well as a number of places where shoppers can sip a cappuccino or a hot chocolate with pastry or a sandwich.

And the building is barely two-thirds complete. An absurdity? An anachronism? No more so than the building itself: the glorious Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.   Manhattan's 20th-century French Gothic cathedral, the colossus of Morningside Heights, is indeed absurd. Yet the century that has given us Camus, Genet and Steve Martin is one that has found in absurdity a redeeming spiritual grace. In this sense, at least, St. John's stained glass windows reflect our age as accurately as the glass curtain wall of an office tower designed by Mies van der Rohe. To paraphrase Beckett, the cathedral can't go on. It goes on. It has been going on since Dec. 27, 1892, when the cornerstone was laid. There have been interruptions. Now and then, the cathedral has halted construction to re-examine its motives or rethink its design. These ruminations have contributed to the impression that \"St. John the Unfinished\" is the existential cathedral, a building at once alienated and engaged. The opposite of \"Hamlet\" in modern dress, St. John's is the anxious modern hero in period costume.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"U.N.

The new proposals, agreed to by the major political parties, would also limit the number of ethnic Germans from other countries who could claim German citizenship.\n\nThe violence, which has caused some deaths, is reminiscent of the 1920's and early 30's when the Nazis were ascending to power.
