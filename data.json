Unlike the \"Tosca\" next door, Franco Zeffirelli's extravaganza at the Metropolitan Opera, with its slick grandeur, technological wizardry and hyperrealistic detail, Mr. Corsaro's intimate conception, with stage direction by Cynthia Edwards, stresses dark, gritty \"realism\" in its characterization.

In a string of hits since 1985, and in her concerts, Ms. Houston's power and agility have always been exhilarating, although they didn't always connect with the shape of the songs. But at Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, opening a seven-night engagement through Sept. 27, she harnessed her vocals to her material for a concert that was not just flamboyant but often moving.   Ms. Houston sang two sets of love songs. In the first, she was backed by her band and flanked by four athletic dancers; in the second, she was a diva backed by a small orchestra. The two sets represented both sides of a successful career strategy that has kept her frisky enough for young pop fans yet respectable enough for their parents.   The first half was a tour de force. Ms. Houston had routines to run through: dance steps, a disco segment, and a denunciation of tabloid rumours about marital trouble (which followed two ardent kisses from her husband, the singer Bobby Brown). But she could easily wing it; when her daughter toddled on stage, she sang \"Old MacDonald\" to her, with the sultriest \"e-i-e-i-o\" imaginable. Ms. Houston tore into her hits with a playful virtuosity.   In uptempo songs, her three female backup singers took care of the straightforward choruses while Ms. Houston volleyed responses. She tossed around syncopations, percussive or soaring, using every repeated lyric as a springboard for a new improvisation. In a medley of ballads, she caressed and savored every line. She sounded tenderly tremulous as she asked, \"Where do broken hearts go?,\" affectionate and satisfied as she declared, \"Nobody loves me like you do.\" \"Love,\" a word that reappears countless times in her songs, could be an airy note, a voluptuous glide, a joyful cascade. Where she once lavished ornaments at random, she now puts across sentiment as well as showiness.   For the second half, Ms. Houston belted ballads, predictably bringing down the house with songs that moved from aching verses to surging choruses. A medley of hits from Dionne Warwicke, Ms. Houston's cousin, lacked Ms. Warwicke's lightness, but Ms. Houston made \"Alfie\" sound like the ethical wrangle it is. Ms. Houston dedicated \"I Will Always Love You\" to her father, who she said had gone to the hospital that afternoon. Her tearful voice -- it even broke on one note -- gave the song more immediacy than the stentorian recorded version.   The concert's catalyst was gospel, the music Ms. Houston grew up on. Between ballads she broke into a gospel song, moving across the stage like a singer getting the spirit. Her call-and-response arrangements, and some of her best improvised moments, also came directly from sanctified singing. \"Sometimes the church comes out and I can't help myself,\" Ms. Houston said at one point. Gospel links musical display to getting a message across, so Ms. Houston shouldn't hold back: the more she lets loose her gospel heritage, the better she sounds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Amid the Heat and the Interceptions, Jets Fall Back to Earth With a Thud","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/sports/pro-football-amid-heat-interceptions-jets-fall-back-earth-with-thud.html","abstract":"  So they're not perfect.

Raoul Cedras to give up his tyrant's grip on Haiti shows what a difference decisive commitment can make in American foreign policy. When at long last President Clinton made clear that he meant business, and former President Carter's mission underlined that determination, the game was over for the Haitian military.   \"This agreement came,\" President Clinton said in announcing the news, \"only because of the credible and imminent threat of the international force\" that was about to invade Haiti.   The denouement is a critical victory for a politically battered Bill Clinton. He came to the point of ordering an invasion of Haiti with evident reluctance, without asking Congress and against what polls said the public wanted. It was a very large gamble and it worked.    The fact that Gen. Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn were part of the Carter mission that Mr. Clinton sent to Haiti makes the result even happier for him politically. General Powell wears no party's label but has been eyed by Republicans as a potential candidate. Senator Nunn is the most important Southern Democrat in Congress.    As the American and other forces go in, Haiti still remains a potential policy minefield. But at least we are past the long, dismal example of classic failure in foreign policy: the failure to decide.    General Cedras and his colleagues overthrew Haiti's elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30, 1991. That posed a choice for American policy. We could work vigorously to undo the coup and restore Haiti's legitimate Government, or we could decide that what happened in Haiti did not engage the deepest U.S. interests.   President Bush sounded as if he had chosen the former course. He called the coup a threat to American security and said it would not stand. He demanded \"an immediate halt to violence and the restoration of democracy.\" But during the remaining 15 months of his Presidency Mr. Bush made no real effort to oust the Haitian military regime.   President Clinton, after he took office, shifted to a policy of negotiating with General Cedras for a settlement that would bring President Aristide back but give the military guarantees of safety. Negotiations took place on Governors Island in New York, and agreement was reached there on July 3, 1993. The plan called for President Aristide to return to Haiti on Oct. 30.   In the months between the Governors Island agreement and the scheduled date of President Aristide's return, there were many signals that General Cedras had no intention of doing what he had promised. The so-called \"attaches,\" killers directed by the military, murdered numbers of civilians in Port-au-Prince and assassinated a leading Aristide supporter.   But the Clinton Administration proceeded as if it believed Governors Island would be carried out. In October the Defense Department sent a U.S. ship, the Harlan County, to Haiti with 175 American and 25 Canadian soldiers who were supposed to train Haitian security forces for President Aristide's return.   On Oct. 11, 1993, as the Harlan County arrived in the harbor, armed goons and uniformed policemen demonstrated on the docks, beating civilians and shouting against the United States. The Clinton Administration ordered the Harlan County to leave.   That, surely, was the moment for decision. President Clinton could have ordered an immediate strike. A small invasion force, entirely adequate to round up the military leaders and their thugs, could have been quickly assembled. Congress and the public would have supported that response to the deliberate insulting of the United States. But Mr. Clinton did not act.   Nearly another year passed, with Americans unpersuaded that President Clinton had the determination or the power to act. Then he made the decision to invade, and the drama quickly changed.   This is President Clinton's moment, without wanting to quibble at that one may express the hope that from this episode will arise a new decisiveness in American foreign policy. The next best place to apply it is Bosnia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Cairo Policy On Economy Raises Fears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/world/cairo-policy-on-economy-raises-fears.html","abstract":"  Defying demands by the International Monetary Fund to devalue its currency and institute stiff economic changes, the Egyptian Government is pursuing policies that many economists and Western diplomats say could lead to severe economic upheaval and social unrest.

Holbein's 9-yard score on a shovel pass from Tommie Frazier was the sixth of seven Nebraska touchdowns in the 49-21 victory over U.C.L.A., an overpowering outcome that still did not prevent the Huskers from losing ground at the top of the combined polls that determine bowl-game matchups.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/nyregion/metro-digest-284033.html","abstract":"  NEGOTIATION IS KEY TO GIULIANI SUCCESS   Mayor Giuliani strode into office talking tough to labor.

But the songs and dances they presented at Eisner and Lubin Auditorium at New York University have had to survive some storms of history.   The Namgyal Monastery, a center of Tantric Buddhism, was founded in 1574 and is the personal monastery of the Dalai Lama. The Chinese Communists outlawed Buddhism after they took over Tibet in 1949. A decade later, the Dalai Lama fled into exile and the monks followed him. In 1961, they established a new Namgyal Monastery in Dharamsala in northern India. This program by a troupe of eight monks was a benefit for both the monastery and the Namgyal Fund, a refugee aid organization.   09-19-94 The music was notable for its unusual sonorities. Low roarings and rumblings produced by enormously long horns were contrasted with the high-pitched nasal piercing sounds of oboelike instruments. There were also trumpets, cymbals, bells and drums.   The dances emphasized constant repetitions of a few basic steps, especially slow, careful raisings of the feet. These works are not meant to dazzle or even entertain spectators, although they were always fascinating to watch. Rather, they are religious rituals in which movement becomes a form of meditation and the performers can visualize themselves as deities as they dance.   Because the same steps occur so often, any dramatic hints of menace soon vanish. The monks were costumed as skeletons and hopped grotesquely in the \"Dance of the Cemetery Lords.\" But they never looked frightening, in part because what they did became so familiar through repetition that it no longer had the power to startle. Death was thereby choreographically transfigured.   \"Black Hat Dance\" was also filled with hopping. Yet this symbolic depiction of the overcoming of obstacles did not grow agitated. Instead, it expressed faith in the ultimate power of goodness.   In \"Deer Dance,\" the evening's most charming piece, a masked and antlered soloist did quick little bouncing steps. But the solo was intended to do more than charm, for the deer was an image of a protective deity. The Namgyal Monks made strong dancing a sign of spiritual strength.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940919","headline":"Doctor Shows for the High-Tech 90's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/19/arts/television-review-doctor-shows-for-the-high-tech-90-s.html","abstract":"  Like westerns, cop shows and sitcoms, the combination of doctors and hospitals is a television staple.

The new Mayor has thus moved to repair a scandalous lack of productivity that the Dinkins administration, dependent on labor support, tried and failed to correct.   Under the accord, which must still be ratified by members of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, sanitation workers will be assigned routes that are 20 percent longer, and collect nearly two tons more material on each truck per day. Thus, for example, a two-person sanitation crew working, say, a 20-block route of densely populated apartment houses, will now get a new route that stretches 24 to 25 blocks -- increasing the crew's daily collection from 8.5 tons to 10.1 tons, roughly the truck's capacity. The new routes will be set unilaterally by the city, and not negotiated with the union, as in the past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940920","headline":"Haitians Far From Home Find Skepticism Is Tinged With Despair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/20/world/mission-haiti-expatriates-haitians-far-home-find-skepticism-tinged-with-despair.html","abstract":"  A record shop called L'An 2000 did not even bother to blare Haitian merengue music onto Nostrand Avenue yesterday; the only thing that mattered in that corner of Flatbush was the Cable News Network, and so CNN it was.

It was the nation's largest oil spill -- some would say its worst environmental disaster -- and all parties have since paid dearly. Exxon has already spent $3.4 billion to clean up the mess and settle Federal and state suits. The Alaskans who fish and hunt there have lost untold millions because of the degradation of the ecosystem on which their lives depend.    Now comes the biggest penalty of all -- a $5 billion jury award of punitive damages to 34,000 fishermen and other Alaskans.

Dioxin, which is a probable cause of cancer and of developmental disorders, is largely produced from the combustion of such chlorine-containing substances as plastics. Therefore, the main source of dioxins is incinerator smokestacks. In addition, incineration releases other pollutants and also contributes to global warming.   Yet instead of outlawing incinerators, worldwide experience suggests that it is better to create a recycling-friendly economic environment. This is achieved by mandating that newspapers be printed on recycled paper and that soda be sold in recycled bottles.   Once such laws take effect, a market develops for used newspapers and soda bottles, and consequently they disappear from regular garbage. The combustible fraction in municipal waste drops to the point where the garbage can no longer be burned, and therefore incineration is phased out.   Worldwide experience also shows that when regulations treat the dioxin-containing fly-ash from incinerators as toxic waste, resulting disposal costs tend to work against incineration and in favor of recycling.   It can be concluded that if the proper regulations exist, economic forces will support recycling. On a per-ton basis, recycling in populated areas will cost half as much as landfilling and one-third as much as incineration. In addition, the recycling industry creates low-skilled jobs and reduces pollution.
