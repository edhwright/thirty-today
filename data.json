Mr. Redman is still unproved, a musician with promise and not much of a track record beyond an ability to sell records. But he came through: in front of a full house, he made a strong case for himself as an intelligent, musically sophisticated and graceful musician. He also proved himself to be a Sonny Rollins surrogate in that the audience was clearly on his mind, occasionally at the expense of his work as a serious musician.   Mr. Redman's best came out in the second tune of the concert, \"Rejoice,\" constructed out of a rhythmic pattern, a repeating bass line, some ambiguous chords and a rapidly shifting chordal passage. Mr. Redman's musicians -- Brad Mehldau on piano, Chris McBride on bass, Brian Blade on drums -- have been playing together regularly and are almost supernaturally empathetic, one of the better working bands in jazz. They made the tune completely pliable, with the rhythm section moving from frozen rubato sections to jet-stream swing. The elements of the composition popped up now and then, seemingly at the players' collective whim, and the whole performance sparkled, as if Mr. Redman had come up with a new group sound and a new way of codifying improvisation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"From Afar, Frier Still A Part of Seahawks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/sports/football-from-afar-frier-still-a-part-of-seahawks.html","abstract":"  They flew in to see his immobile body, hoped they would not weep, and instead he offered them tickets to see Chris Warren play football.   \"I told him, 'No!' \" said Mike Frier's father, Ulysses, today. \"I said, \"We aren't here to see a game, we're here to see you.' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"The Obesity Gene","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/opinion/the-obesity-gene.html","abstract":"  The identification of a genetic flaw that seems to cause obesity in mice -- and possibly in humans as well -- caused ripples of excitement when it was announced last week.

The Goats played politically conscious, free-floating rap with deep roots in Philadelphia, and Big Chief made apocalyptic hard rock influenced almost exclusively by bands from its home state of Michigan.   The Goats are one of hip-hop's best live acts not just because they're actually a band (with a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist and an organist) but also because they find the right balance between their instinct to party and their desire to provide inner-city commentary on Washington politics. On Tuesday, the rappers known as Madd and Swayzack alternated between exchanging lines as if they were in a dialogue and shouting out phrases in unison. The music followed their lead, sinking into a slow funk groove during the dialoguelike verses and swelling into a cacophony of scratching records, riffing guitars and breakbeats during the choruses.    Where the Goats are influenced by lowdown funk and early heavy metal, Big Chief are obsessed by these styles. Its last album, \"Mack Avenue Skull Game,\" was a fake soundtrack that sounded as if it was scored by George Clinton. Its newest, \"Platinum Jive\" (Capitol), is a fake compilation that ranges from hard guitar rock written in the style of late 1960's Detroit bands like the Stooges and MC5 to rap.

Although the regular season had already ended for Nebraska and Penn State, the last two contenders with perfect records, the elimination of the Crimson Tide and a unique bowl schedule combined to give the Cornhuskers one additional complication and the Nittany Lions one small added edge.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"In Brownsville, Family Looks For Answers After Tragedy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/nyregion/in-brownsville-family-looks-for-answers-after-tragedy.html","abstract":"  From the conversation in his neighborhood and around his father's kitchen table, it is impossible to construct a picture of Richard Larrier that is anything but dissonant: former marine, hard worker, loving father, armed robber, killer.   \"I'm just as much in shock as anybody,\" his father, Kenneth Larrier said quietly yesterday in his 11th-floor apartment in the Langston Hughes Houses in Brownsville, Brooklyn.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941205","headline":"Sports of The Times; Situated in the Hot Seat, Brown Keeps His Cool","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/05/sports/sports-of-the-times-situated-in-the-hot-seat-brown-keeps-his-cool.html","abstract":"  THIRD-AND-15, the Giants backed up at their 21-yard line, the Browns' defense infused with a late-game dose of rabid adrenaline.

The results, though preliminary, strengthen the case for needle exchange programs, not only in New York but in all cities with intravenous drug users at risk of infection with AIDS. Such programs are banned in some states and only allowed as an experiment in New York.   The logic behind needle exchanges has always seemed plausible. In many cities, addicts who inject drugs have been devastated by AIDS, largely because the AIDS virus can be spread from person to person through the sharing of needles and syringes. One way to slow this spread, the reasoning goes, is to give addicts clean needles in exchange for used needles that may be contaminated. The addicts may remain hooked on their drugs, but at least they are less likely to spread the AIDS virus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941206","headline":"Mr. Clinton's Future and the G.O.P.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/06/opinion/mr-clinton-s-future-and-the-gop.html","abstract":"  Representative Newt Gingrich's freewheeling performance on \"Meet the Press\" and Senator Bob Dole's earlier foray into diplomacy affirm the Republican leadership's ability to dominate the news at the expense of a racked White House.

Starr, will uncover any evidence that Bill or Hillary Clinton broke any law, told any lie or violated any ethical standard in their financial dealings in Arkansas in the late 1970's and early 80's.   In part, that is because Mr. Starr is pursuing Whitewater as purely a criminal matter; what if any wrongdoing by the Clintons was at worst civil rather than criminal?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941206","headline":"BENTSEN IS POISED TO LEAVE CABINET, OFFICIALS CONFIRM","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/06/us/bentsen-is-poised-to-leave-cabinet-officials-confirm.html","abstract":"  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen plans to announce his resignation this week, senior Administration officials said tonight, ending months of speculation about the tenure of the Cabinet's most prominent member.

Under the bill, customers of the big places may smoke only in the bar area -- and it must be at least six feet from the dining area or separated by a floor-to-ceiling partition. But the smaller places have been given an exemption.   Constructing separate areas for smokers, the small-restaurant owners testified at previous Council hearings, is impractical and impossibly costly for them. It probably is. But there is no reason they can't ban smoking entirely. In the 100 American cities with anti-smoking legislation that does not exempt small restaurants, the law has had little or no effect on their revenues. According to a recent Gallup Poll of 763 adult New Yorkers, a smoking ban might, in fact, increase restaurant patronage and revenues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941207","headline":"In Tough Neighborhood, Boy Recalls What Might Have Been","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/nyregion/in-tough-neighborhood-boy-recalls-what-might-have-been.html","abstract":"Sal Ayala walks to work each day past images of what might have been his future in the shadows of his East Harlem neighborhood and the bustling halls of his high school.\n\n\"I could have ended up in jail or selling drugs, or dead,\" said Sal, a 15-year-old sophomore at the Urban Peace Academy, an experimental public school that opened last fall in East Harlem, where drugs, violence and unwanted pregnancies take a damaging toll on teen-age lives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941207","headline":"Father Testifies on Last Hours Of His Daughter in Hospital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/nyregion/father-testifies-on-last-hours-of-his-daughter-in-hospital.html","abstract":"  Nearly a decade after he filed a malpractice suit against four doctors and New York Hospital in the death of his daughter, Sidney Zion finally had his day in court yesterday to tell of his last hours in the hospital with her, when doctors reassured him that she looked far sicker than she actually was.

In the booming 80's, the failure to follow up on patients who had been blithely deinstitutionalized became manifest in the ragged multitudes of homeless psychotics left in the dust by prosperity's gold chariot.

It is important to review what these developments mean and do not mean for Mr. Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The downfall of even so close an associate as Mr. Hubbell does not mean that the Clintons have done anything wrong. Similarly, Mr. Palmer seems more closely tied to Jim Guy Tucker, the Governor of Arkansas. But the Palmer case establishes beyond a doubt that there were serious problems of mismanagement and political favoritism at Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan operated by James McDougal, the Clintons' business partner in the Whitewater Development Corporation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941207","headline":"1894: Russia to Stay Out : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/opinion/IHT-1894-russia-to-stay-out-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ST.
