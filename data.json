The statisticians are to finish their analysis in two weeks, said Dr. Michael A. Friedman, an official of the National Cancer Institute, a Federal agency in Bethesda, Md. The institute, which commissioned the review, paid tens of millions of dollars for the initial study, which helped change the way breast cancer is treated. It concluded that lumpectomies followed by radiation are as effective as full mastectomies in preventing spread of the disease in many women with early breast cancer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940316","headline":"Giuliani Cuts Cash Awards To Landlords for Homeless","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/nyregion/giuliani-cuts-cash-awards-to-landlords-for-homeless.html","abstract":"  The Giuliani administration has ordered drastic cuts in a program that has awarded landlords thousands of dollars in incentives for providing apartments to homeless families living in shelters.

The alternative fear is that Bang on a Can, having allowed itself to be absorbed by Lincoln Center, will surrender its quirkily omnivorous character and be sucked into the bland mainstream.    Maybe both sides have a point. But after their first dance, on Monday evening at the Walter Reade Theater, neither Lincoln Center nor Bang on a Can seemed any worse for the encounter.

Mr. Hubbell had undertaken major responsibilities and, by Ms. Reno's account, was acquitting himself well. Still, the presence of the President's old golfing partner in the number three post has long created the impression that the interests of Justice were subservient to the political requirements of the White House.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940316","headline":"If Kohl Were to Fall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/opinion/IHT-if-kohl-were-to-fall.html","abstract":"Helmut Kohl has put a brave face on it, but the vote in Lower Saxony makes it necessary for Germany's friends to start wondering what a Kohl-less Germany would mean for them..Mr. Kohl says he still has a realistic chance of staying chancellor after nex","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940316","headline":"Rangers' Canseco Contemplated Suicide","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/sports/sports-people-baseball-rangers-canseco-contemplated-suicide.html","abstract":"  JOSE CANSECO was so upset over the crumbling of his personal and professional lives that he considered committing suicide, although the Texas Rangers slugger says he never tried killing himself.   \"The last two years were a total nightmare,\" Canseco told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist JIM REEVES in a column published yesterday. \"When the bottom really fell out was that period from about four or five months after I was traded until about six or eight months ago.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940316","headline":"In Italian Election, Brash Words Help","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/world/in-italian-election-brash-words-help.html","abstract":"  Umberto Bossi seemed to be warmed less by the loden topcoat that protected him from the Alpine cold than by the fervor of his accustomed conviction.   \"We will be the linchpin of any government that is formed in this country,\" the slight, tousled leader of the separatist-minded Northern League told a crowd in the mountain town of Aosta early this month.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940316","headline":"Administration Faulted on Rikers Melee","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/16/nyregion/administration-faulted-on-rikers-melee.html","abstract":"  A day after a melee on Rikers Island, the New York City Council Speaker questioned whether a recent transfer of inmates to the prison might have contributed to the disturbance, and leaders of the guards' union seized the occasion to warn that budget cuts could lead to more trouble.

The first concert, last Thursday, was devoted to Baroque music, and the finale, on Saturday, will be a bouquet of favorites by Albeniz, Falla and Barrios. But although Mr. Williams's mastery of those styles is evident from his many recordings, in some ways the most inviting of the three was the 20th-century program he played on Tuesday evening.   Actually, Mr. Williams's taste in new music is on the conservative side, and although the program brought together composers from an unusually broad geographic range -- Australia, Japan, Russia, the Czech Republic, Spain, Cuba and Italy were represented -- stylistic variety was less pronounced. Tonality reigned, and most of the works, including the latest additions to Mr. Williams's repertory, were built on harmonies, arpeggiation styles and juxtapositions of timbre that fell naturally on the fretboard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940317","headline":"2 Top Art Shows Select French Directors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/17/arts/2-top-art-shows-select-french-directors.html","abstract":"  French curators will be in charge of the next incarnations of Europe's two most important surveys of international contemporary art.

Vladimir Chernov, the Russian baritone who has swiftly established himself as a major Verdi singer at the Met, ventured out of his accustomed territory to sing Figaro. \"Largo al factotum\" left no doubt of the rich, vibrant, rock-solid timbre of his voice and also of his considerable technical agility.

There were moments when his portrayal of Figaro's self-possession ended up as mere arrogance.   Stanford Olsen initially seemed underpowered as the Count; his light tenor paled next to Mr. Chernov's powerful sound. But the refined ease of his coloratura singing combined with comic agility to produce a satisfying performance in the end.
