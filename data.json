Although historical records show Christus was a successful and wealthy painter, admitted to the highest circles of society, quite soon after his death toward the end of the century his art was all but forgotten. In the 1820's he was rediscovered, only to be brushed aside in this century by art historians like Max Friedlander and Erwin Panofsky as a weak hanger-on of van Eyck. PETRUS CHRISTUS: Renaissance Master of Bruges (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $60) teases out the obviously derivative elements of Christus's small oeuvre from his perhaps minor but nonetheless significant contributions to Renaissance Flemish panel painting. As Maryan W. Ainsworth, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows in her scholarly essay, Christus married his intimate knowledge of illumination techniques to the new medium of oil painting. His often diminutive, richly detailed panels shimmer with color. Ms. Ainsworth's painstaking examination of the artist's technique, aided by scientific analyses of the underpaintings, quite conclusively distinguishes Christus's slightly dreamy artistic sensibility from that of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get realism of van Eyck. However, in her zeal to restore Christus's status as an original artist, the author sometimes glosses over his obvious deficiencies -- Christus's portraits (which, although expertly executed, do tend to look alike) are described as \"consistent in their physiognomy.\" However, while the book sometimes plunges the layman deep into the arcane world of art conservation with its abstruse terminology, it does succeed in bringing to life not just the work of Christus, but also his richly adorned (and beautifully painted) world of the 15th century's wealthy and devout.\nSIRI HUNTOON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"DRIVING SMART;\nCleaner Starts for the Catalytic Converter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/automobiles/driving-smart-cleaner-starts-for-the-catalytic-converter.html","abstract":"AUTOMOTIVE engineers have long known that cars do their most serious polluting right after they are started, before their catalytic converters warm up.\n\n\"Three-quarters of hydrocarbon emissions come out of the tailpipe in the first two minutes,\" says Joe Kubsh, an engineer in Novi, Mich., for W.

Last week the process seemed to move ahead by two, three, maybe even four inches, a monumental leap by past standards. For the first time, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has put forward a specific timetable for the initial phase of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. He talks of a \"slight pullback\" that would last three years, adding that Israel expects that full and normal relations would develop with Damascus during that trial period.    This has the tone of an opening bid. So does the response of Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, who said he saw no need for so long a trial period given the smallness of the Golan Heights.  Notably missing in his remarks to a Dutch television interviewer was the ritual castigation of Israel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"Hilary H.

The cause, at least so far, is not the imminent performance of \"Orpheus and Euridice\" by Pina Bausch's Wuppertal Tanztheater but the fact that the World Cup match pitting Italy against Spain has just begun. Booming loudspeakers make intermittent announcements; from one of the buildings flanking the square, collective shouts rise up through the thick walls.

At 53, she is a strikingly elegant figure, thin and angular, dressed on this occasion in black pants with a black chemise flowing nearly to her ankles. Her face is austerely beautiful, planed and bony like an early Picasso, with enormous pale blue eyes and graying hair pulled back tightly from her high cheekbones.

Any team-based production (a film, electronic game, reference work or textbook, for instance) is far costlier to develop than the average book is to write. Book publishers whose primary income comes from games, textbooks and reference books might find new media of long-term interest, but others ought to remind themselves that complexity, subtlety, intellectual rigor and originality have a hard time clearing the economic hurdles of the marketplace -- if new media cost a lot to develop, each title will need a mass audience to make the undertaking viable.

One moment, Mr. Scaggs sounds like a raw Texan blues singer, then with a slight softening of tone he metamorphoses into a patrician San Franciscan pop crooner. The change from one thing into another isn't so much a matter of self-conscious role-playing as it is of allowing different facets of a many-layered musical personality to edge to the fore.    The singer, who performed at Town Hall in Manhattan with a five-member band and two backup vocalists on Saturday and Sunday, started out as a Texan blues-rock singer. He reached his peak of popularity in 1976 with a sophisticated pop-soul album, \"Silk Degrees,\" which had something of a disco ambiance. His best-loved songs include romantic ballads like \"Harbor Lights\" and \"We're All Alone\" in which his reedy, quirky pop baritone projects considerable tension and vulnerability. Although the music on his newest album, \"Some Change\" (Virgin), is tougher and more guitar-oriented than it is on his earlier records, the songs also have a brooding, introspective undertone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"Flawed Characters In the Public Eye, Past and Present","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/movies/flawed-characters-in-the-public-eye-past-and-present.html","abstract":"  Paul Attanasio was born in 1959, the same year the quiz show scandal on television stunned and outraged the nation.

That makes sense -- if the monitors can verify that the embargo is really being enforced. The U.N. imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia to get Belgrade to cut off the Bosnian Serbs.

On Saturday, the Fall was joined by Mr. Smith's ex-wife, Brix, who left the band in 1989 but rejoined it last month. Her sharp, simple bass and guitar lines funneled the band's diverse energies into hard-hitting post-punk.

Ten members of New York's police force have killed themselves this year, equaling the number in 1987, the worst year until now.    The suicides, including two last Tuesday, have brought renewed attention to a long-smoldering problem on the police force: the depth of suspicion that troubled officers have for the department's array of counseling services. Most officers shun them for fear of jeopardizing their careers or out of a stubborn attitude that they should deal with their own ordeals. And many sergeants are loath to report tormented officers because they do not want to be looked upon as the heavy. Of the 10 policemen who took their lives this year, only one was being treated by a department psychologist.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"In Immigration Labyrinth, Corruption Comes Easily","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/us/in-immigration-labyrinth-corruption-comes-easily.html","abstract":"  Up and down the East Coast, the word quickly spread through immigrant communities.

There were, as well, nine police officers at the scene -- four in plain clothes, four in uniform, one off duty. Two of the officers ended up wounded, one critically. The investigation, begun that night, involved two different departments -- the New York City Police Department and the Transit Police Department.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"The Hidden Population Issue: Money","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/world/the-hidden-population-issue-money.html","abstract":"  When all the sound and fury of the conference on population has faded to whispers, one inescapable reality will remain: money.   No matter who wins or who loses in the political jousts over abortion and homosexuality, migrants and monogamy, the real test of whether the United Nations Conference on Population and Development has made a difference will lie not just in the readiness of rich donors to give far greater aid, but also in the willingness of poor recipients to spend more of their own money to solve their problems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19940912","headline":"Frank Eugene Corder fatally crashes a single-engine Cessna 150 into the White House's south lawn, striking the West wing.

Originally, it was a brand of the Cessna Aircraft Company, an American general aviation aircraft manufacturing corporation also headquartered in Wichita. The company produced small, piston-powered aircraft, as well as business jets. For much of the mid-to-late 20th century, Cessna was one of the highest-volume and most diverse producers of general aviation aircraft in the world. It was founded in 1927 by Clyde Cessna and Victor Roos and was purchased by General Dynamics in 1985, then by Textron, Inc. in 1992. In March 2014, when Textron purchased the Beechcraft and Hawker Aircraft corporations, Cessna ceased operations as a subsidiary company, and joined the others as one of the three distinct brands produced by Textron Aviation."},{"title":"White House","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House","description":"Official residence and workplace of the president of the United States","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/White_House_north_and_south_sides.jpg/320px-White_House_north_and_south_sides.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":366},"abstract":"The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States.
