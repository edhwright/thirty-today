The group, the Regional Plan Association, said that vast expanses of open space, previously considered invulnerable, are now threatened. A decade of frenetic development has claimed farmland, forests and verdant private estates from northern Connecticut to southern New Jersey, it said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930608","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/08/style/chronicle-756593.html","abstract":"  The guard at the State Department changed yesterday when RICHARD BOUCHER, the bearded and unflappable press secretary whose soft but authoritative voice and skill at obfuscation were well known to diplomatic reporters, stepped aside in favor of MIKE McCURRY.

Based on past performance, that means only 350,000 or so voters are likely to turn out in the Republican primary, dividing their votes among the party's three major candidates.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930608","headline":"Kohl and the Skinheads : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/08/opinion/IHT-kohl-and-the-skinheads-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"A Newly Excellent German Politics, Please\" by John Vinocur (Opinion, June 2): .I agree absolutely that Chancellor Helmut Kohl should have the courage to go on television to condemn, vigorously and personally, the terrible aggressio","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930608","headline":"Fate of Space Station Is in Doubt As All Options Exceed Cost Goals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/08/science/fate-of-space-station-is-in-doubt-as-all-options-exceed-cost-goals.html","abstract":"  A NASA design team told a Presidential committee today that all options for a proposed scaled-down version of the space station exceeded budget goals set by the White House.

The $3,000 down payment they make to \"snakehead\" smugglers before departure -- several years' earnings for a typical Chinese -- covers barely a tenth of what they must ultimately pay to travel huddled below deck for months without adequate food or sanitation.

Self-destruction is another matter. \"We gave things away,\" Johnson said after the top-seeded Aggies were eliminated from the College World Series yesterday with a 6-2 loss to Long Beach State in Omaha. Long Beach Coach Dave Snow saw it differently: \"We saw an opportunity and came up big with it.\" Texas, the Aggies' rival and another top team, was also eliminated, losing by 7-6 to Oklahoma State in another elimination game. In Long Beach's victory, Cobi Cradle drove in two runs in support of Daniel Choi (17-2). Cradle singled in a run in the third and another one in the seventh, sparking a four-run inning by the 49ers (45-18). For the Cowboys (45-16), Sean Hugo homered to tie the score at 6-6 in the eighth and Hunter Triplett doubled in the go-ahead run in the ninth. (AP) TENNIS  2 Seeded Stars Ousted  Goran Ivanisevic and Ivan Lendl expected to use the Queen's Club grass-court tournament as a key warmup for Wimbledon, but now they will have to get ready on the practice courts. Chris Wilkinson, a British wild-card entry ranked 176th in the world, shocked Ivanisevic, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, in one second-round match at the London tournament. Byron Black of Zimbabwe, ranked 116th, upset Lendl, 6-2, 7-6 (13-11), in another match. Among yesterday's winners were second-seeded Stefan Edberg and No. 3 Boris Becker. The fourth-seeded Ivanisevic, last year's Wimbledon finalist, fired nine aces but also had eight double faults. The fifth-seeded Lendl had a chance to level his match when he served at 5-4 in the second set but was broken. (AP) A Struggle for Navratilova: Top-seeded Martina Navratilova had to fight hard for a 7-5, 7-6 (7-1) victory over Maria Strandlund of Sweden in the second round of the Edgbaston tournament in Birmingham, England. Navratilova was kept on court for 96 minutes by the 23-year-old from Stockholm, who broke the nine-time Wimbledon champion's serve four times. (AP) Victories at the Top: Top-seeded Andrei Medvedev and second-seeded Richard Krajicek won in straight sets to advance to the second round of the Continental grass court championships in Rosmalen, the Netherlands. Medvedev, ranked eighth in the world, defeated a Dutch wild-card entry, Fernon Wibier, 6-4, 6-4. Krajicek, ranked 12th, beat Christian Saceanu of Germany, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1. Also advancing was third-seeded MaliVai Washington, a 6-4, 7-5 winner over the Dutch player, Jacco Eltingh. (AP) FENCING  New Yorker Wins Foil  Felicia Zimmermann of Rush, N.Y., last night won the national fencing championship in Division I women's foil in Fort Myers, Fla. The 17-year-old Zimmerman defeated 20-year-old Olga Chernyak of Lafayette, Calif., 6-5, 5-1, for the gold medal. Zimmermann finished fourth in this event last year.

James DePreist conducted the orchestra with mixed but generally pleasing results. His account of the Barber, though on the brisk side, was a picture of lucidity. Details that are usually obscured -- fleeting brass effects, inner wind lines -- were spotlighted without being given an unnatural prominence.

Sting was smart to return to mid-size theaters like the 5,605-seat Paramount for his current tour (although he's also opening some stadium shows for the Grateful Dead), because the music he's making now moves too fast and too subtly for most arena concerts. He writes and sings pop songs, but in concert they're laced with jazzy improvisation, transforming them between the lines of catchy choruses and rolling grooves. For all of Sting's associations with causes, and the earnest moping of many of his lyrics, he has rarely been a preachy performer in concert. And on Tuesday, Sting the musician was triumphant.   While Sting's bands, including the Police, have never been content to play songs by rote, his current group takes on all challenges, from odd meters and harmonic substitutions to the openness and understatement of a ballad. Sting's own bass was both foundation and fulcrum for a nimble four-piece band including Dominic Miller on guitar, David Sancious on keyboards and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums. They don't have the jazz pedigrees of his first post-Police group, but they mesh gleefully and they know which gambits belong where.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930610","headline":"Japan Is Represented by an Artist It Once Rejected","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/arts/japan-is-represented-by-an-artist-it-once-rejected.html","abstract":"  The last time Yayoi Kusama displayed her art at the Venice Biennale was 1966.

The Pentagon's problem stems from a confluence of factors: budget accounting practices, the cost of new programs, budget limitations imposed by Congress and the different priorities of Mr. Aspin and Congress. That adds up to a situation in which the Pentagon, after already making steep cuts beyond those that had been planned by the Bush Administration, would still exceed its $263 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930610","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/nyregion/bridge-664093.html","abstract":"  Many players from the New York metropolitan area posted high North American scores in the Epson Worldwide Bridge contest last week.
