The Senate has the authority to confirm nominees and ratify treaties, and both houses can vote down or condition appropriations for everything from foreign aid and intelligence to troop deployments.    Sharper foreign policy debate can be healthy. The Administration has not performed so brilliantly that it can afford to brush off useful criticism. No great philosophical differences divide Mr. Clinton from mainstream Republicans on many issues, and both parties need to consider how to reshape U.S. policies to a changed world.

As households with working dads and stay-at-home moms became an increasingly smaller proportion of American families, social policy makers worried about the effects of divorce, illegitimacy and working mothers on student achievement.

An eccentric but absorbing mixture of documentary, fantasy and polemic, the film uses the image of hundreds of penguins marching stolidly across the frozen desert of Antarctica as a metaphor for nature's alarm at human cruelty and pollution. Moving in solemn processional columns, their chests puffed, their beaks raised high, the penguins look like nothing so much as a bunch of 17-century Pilgrims convening an emergency council to discuss the future of their colony.   Expanding on the notion of birds sitting in judgment on humans is the conversation that the Swiss film maker, who wrote the film with Franz Hohler, imagines the penguins are having with one another. As interpreted by the film's unseen narrator, their alarmed clucks and cries are a collective outcry against the arrival of a party of climate researchers. The penguins, he suggests, share a collective memory of a time earlier in the century when a whaling outpost on South Georgia Island polluted their habitat and threatened their very existence. To help fuel the outpost's processing plants, thousands of live penguins were fed into their furnaces. The film implicitly compares the torching of penguins with the horrors of the Nazi death camps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"Clinton's Luck Takes Upturn On Duck Hunt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/us/clinton-s-luck-takes-upturn-on-duck-hunt.html","abstract":"  A world away from the drained swamp that is Washington, President Clinton toted a borrowed shotgun into a flooded soybean field before dawn today and emerged three hours later bearing two dead ducks and a political message: assault weapons are bad, but banning them doesn't impede hunting, which is a good all-American sport.   \"I really started feeling like a person when I was about five minutes out on the water today,\" Mr. Clinton said with a grin after the outing on a friend's farm near Cotton Plant, about 80 miles northeast of here.

Whatever drum-machine beats there are in ambient dance music are mere sound effects, washing over the listener as part of an electronic collage made up of sampled records, rolling synthesizer arrangements and a panoply of street and nature sounds.   Lately, the avant-garde has been taking ambience back. The Kitchen, a longtime avant-garde art space, has started holding nights of ambient music; the 1970's electronic-music composer Klaus Schulze recently collaborated with the ambient musician Pete Namlook; the maverick producer and bassist Bill Laswell has started his own ambient-music record label; Steve Hillage, a former member of the progressive rock group Gong, has his own ambient band, and many local artists and experimental musicians have started reaching larger audiences by performing at ambient events.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"Brandeis and Cardozo : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/opinion/IHT-brandeis-and-cardozo-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Supreme Court Christmas Party Withstands Challenges\" (Dec. 17):.At the end of her piece, Joan Biskupic says, \"for the first time in history, the court has two Jewish justices.\" This is incorrect.

Beni Montresor's sets, with their pastel shades of pink, blue, yellow and green, offer a storybook view of the Italian countryside. Its components -- houses, a church, trees -- were painted on flat backdrops that ascended and descended with magical efficiency. And the bright costumes in which Mr. Montresor dressed his peasants and soldiers further the fairy-tale imagery, as did Gil Wechsler's soft lighting.   And why not? There are no brain-breaking themes, cosmic truths or moral lessons here, only a featherweight love story and a florid score that, when sung and played as well as it was on Monday, seems to float effortlessly through the sets and out into the house. There were a few needlessly silly touches: soldiers who marched backward and did peculiar dance steps, for example. But for the most part Elizabeth Bachman's staging was direct and traditional. When Donizetti and his librettist, Felice Romani, gave Nemorino and Adina nothing to do but stand and sing, Ms. Bachman left them to it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950104","headline":"Opened Road in Croatia: Path to Peace?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/world/opened-road-in-croatia-path-to-peace.html","abstract":"  On a map, this is a town like any other in Croatia.

The play dates from a time when Goldoni was struggling to transport Venetian theater from the commedia dell'arte's wild improvisations on a bare scenario to the performance of fully written plays, and it has remnants of the commedia's slapstick along with an arsenal of tricks Goldoni devised to grab an audience's attention. The Pearl's version is wonderfully fresh, even if its exuberance at times reminds one of some stage experiments of the 1960's.   Mr. Rando and the actors approach Goldoni's contorted plot with the boisterous humor the playwright intended, often mocking it in asides to the audience, which he also wanted. There are elaborate schemes over a horde of jewels and gold, sword fights, fistfights, love duets, seduction attempts, flirtations with incest, battles with the law and endless confusions of identity, especially between twin brothers who have not seen each other in many years and who turn up in the same town on the same day.
