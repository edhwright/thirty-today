He recalls a bygone age of eccentric, flamboyant pianism, the heyday of legends like Hofmann and Horowitz. But his technique sometimes lags behind his chosen ideal. In the Chopin Second Concerto on Saturday night, certain passages were poorly articulated and ill focused; the interpretation unfolded more as a succession of startling moments than as a coherent whole. The Larghetto, however, left no doubt of Mr. Halim's gift for evocation and emotive intensity.   The central problem was the disparity between the pianist's sumptuous delivery and the somewhat meager resources of the New York Chamber Symphony, under the direction of Gerard Schwarz. Mr. Halim, perched at the edge of the stage, was under unforgiving scrutiny from the hall's close acoustics, and the orchestra did not provide full support. In the end, it's hard to deliver a firm judgment, although the pianist's approach certainly stands apart from the norm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930420","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/20/sports/transactions-658393.html","abstract":"  Baseball  National League   FLORIDA MARLINS -- Placed Bret Barberie, infielder, on the 15-day disabled list.

Now, knowing the Knicks' front line is one of the biggest in the National Basketball Association, he is considering the insertion of Rick Mahorn into the starting lineup.   Also, Daly will probably reinsert guard Drazen Petrovic, who seems back to his normal brilliant-shooting self after a long layoff because of a torn ligament, into the starting rotation when the Nets (43-36) play the Knicks on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden. Petrovic has been coming off the bench since April 14. It was only in the second half of the game against the Washington Bullets on Saturday night that his fluid shooting form returned. A Lot of Beef    Daly doesn't want to get pushed around by the Knicks, who have beef brothers Charles Oakley and Charles Smith, not to mention Anthony Mason. Mahorn, who has been tireless and has played as hard as anyone this season, would give the Nets a big body to bang around with the Knicks' big forwards.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930420","headline":"English Channel Tunnel Is Facing Another Delay","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/20/world/english-channel-tunnel-is-facing-another-delay.html","abstract":"  The British-French company that will operate the rail link beneath the English Channel said today that the tunnel's opening would almost certainly be delayed again, until next year, because of a long-running dispute with the project's contractors.

The case is an appeal by the State of Tennessee, which, like most other states with capital punishment, makes such a crime subject to the death penalty. The crime, felony murder, is a killing that takes place in the course of a robbery, kidnapping or other major crime. Under the Tennessee law, the jury is permitted to consider the felony as a separate, aggravating factor in deciding whether a defendant should be sentenced to death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930420","headline":"Green, Of Course, But, Oh, So Fast","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/20/sports/baseball-green-of-course-but-oh-so-fast.html","abstract":"  The signs were all here tonight, 60 feet 6 inches away from home plate.

Excerpts appear with each article.   Q Has it been the immigration experience, from your perspective, that different groups don't mix?      EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER, 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): It's the language barrier for the most part.     JUAN RIVERA, 18, Brooklyn (Bushwick High School): Yeah, it's, like, in Bushwick. You walk inside the lunchroom, you know, any period, and as soon as you walk in, the biggest group here is, you know, Dominicans, as I said. And you have Puerto Rican people over here. And you have Jamaicans over there.  And then you have the mixed group over here. . . . And it's just like that's it. You know where your group is at.     Q Is there resentment of immigrants? For instance, resentment of their jobs?     BERNARDO VASQUEZ, 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): That's the problem with immigration nativism over here. Why should that person come over here and take my job? I'm American, right? But, no. I get on the job first. Why should they come? I don't care if they're more qualified. I have citizenship.      WUBNESH HYLTON, 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): I know a lot of people who really don't care about -- you know, that fear for immigrants coming and taking jobs is just not there, because there was never no jobs there in the first place. So, they're not really concerned about, \"Oh, he's going to take my job,\" because I didn't have one.     Q When I say that word \"assimilation,\" what do you think of?      WUBNESH Well, conformity. Giving up your own identity, melting into another culture to get ahead. I know some of my Asian friends, I think, like, Asians have a hard time in society, because they're always stereotyped. It's completely different from anything that we know here. And they're always stereotyped as the model minority. And, so, they feel the need to assimilate. And one of my Asian friends was telling me she only dates white men. And another one of my Asian friends, she only dates black men. So, it's, like: \"My culture no longer means anything.\"     Q Do you ever have a sense of loss being here?     BERNARDO As a Dominican, I relate so much to the second motherland, which is the Dominican Republic. But over here, I guess all immigrants . . . have to identify with something that is not America. Because America is no culture.  America is a mixture of -- it is like the melting pot. So, we have to identify with something that is    our culture.   ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (High School of Fashion Industries): Being that in my family I have so much of everything, I don't know what nationality I am. Because I have ancestors that was raped, you know, so I have a little white. I have a little Creole. I have a little Cherokee Indian. The majority of it is black, true. But I have my grandfather's this, my mother has half of that. So I don't know what nationality I am.

Historians from several countries explore the sources of the hate, which the opening segment, \"From the Cross to the Swastika,\" traces to the New Testament, particularly the writings of St. Paul.

Following are excerpts from Wilborn Hampton's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 21, 1992.     Regarded for too long as the author of the High School Senior Play, Thornton Wilder was perhaps the American theater's greatest innovative genius. Often with breathtaking effect, Wilder explored the arrangement of time and space not as cosmic forces but as basic elements that define our everyday lives. Willow Cabin's polished staging of these seldom performed plays not only offers a rare chance to glimpse the origins of Wilder's great works to come, but also allows them to shine as small gems on their own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Polish Church Wins Court Fight on School Religion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/world/polish-church-wins-court-fight-on-school-religion.html","abstract":"  The Roman Catholic Church won a significant victory here today when a constitutional tribunal dismissed a legal challenge to compulsory religious teaching and prayers in public schools.

Excerpts appear with each article.   WUBNESH HYLTON , 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): Working is not, like, a luxury; it's a necessity. Just like for a college student, you know, going to school only is not reality. You have to work and go to school. That's just the way it is. I pay my rent. I pay my bills, you know. Every once in a while I'm afforded a little luxury, you know, but it's pretty straight-laced.   BERNARDO VASQUEZ , 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): I have responsibilities. Like, my father is a superintendent.  I have to clean the building and stuff like that.  I have to take care of my sisters once in a while. And in the case of the work ethic in the sense of ---- I might not like doing this job.  But I'd better do it well, so I'd better start liking it. Because my father is going to come along and check the corners to see if they're clean. So I'd better start liking it.   WUBNESH I enjoy my work. I just wish it paid more. . . . I don't know if I'll keep with it.  . . . It pays the bills, but it doesn't allow you to have any fun and put something in the bank, too.   JUAN RIVERA , 18, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): The thing about it is, is on the job, as far as it getting boring for me. And I might move on or something.    WUBNESH There are no jobs. I think young people want money. And a lot of young people are willing to work for it. But, again, young people want glamorous jobs. They want to work in the Gap. They don't want to work in McDonald's.   JUAN The other reason that a lot of young people don't go out and get jobs is that they don't know how to represent themselves. They might go in with these jeans, you know, untied shoes. . . . And they might not know what to say. They come in, like, \"What's up?\" you know? And they don't know how to represent themselves or something like that in an interview.    WUBNESH When you're younger, identity is something that you have to show. When you get older, identity becomes a part of you, and no matter what you wear, you know who you are. So, when you get older, you put aside your ego with that Champion sweat shirt or whatever.  And you get done with a T-shirt. You know, a suit and stuff. It's not such a big deal anymore.   EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER , 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): Role models really help. I think that might be the most important thing.  If you see somebody who you can relate to, who has gotten somewhere, you know you can get somewhere.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Parcells Isn't Telling the No. 1 Secret","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/sports/pro-football-parcells-isn-t-telling-the-no-1-secret.html","abstract":"  Coach Bill Parcells emerged from his self-described bunker today, brandishing the top pick in the National Football League draft and, as usual, playing it coy.

Three were Czechoslovak, one Austrian; none survived the death camps to which they were sent in 1944 and 1945. The concert, Sunday night at Merkin Hall, gave a close and harrowing sense of the Holocaust's ineradicable calamity: the perishing of a whole musical culture, and the systematic murder of creative souls.   The Theresienstadt camp, established in 1941, served mainly as a holding point for prisoners on their way to the death camps farther east.  It also became a place of temporary confinement for painters, writers and musicians. The Nazis found that the artistic dimension of the camp made for good propaganda, a disguise for atrocities being committed elsewhere. They concocted an absurd film -- \"Hitler Presents the Jews With a City\" -- in which Theresienstadt metamorphosed into a bustling, culturally active village. A Jewish organization was allowed to put on a concert series that included chamber, choral and orchestral music, even several operas. Composers did not work in defiance of the regime, but beneath its lethal gaze; it was a diabolical period of grace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Yanks Wreck Eck Again To Topple the A's in 9th","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/sports/baseball-yanks-wreck-eck-again-to-topple-the-a-s-in-9th.html","abstract":"  The Yankees conquered Dennis Eckersley again tonight, but this time Steve Farr and the Yankee bullpen did their jobs.

That's been the unvarying refrain from studies of state programs to move welfare recipients into jobs. But now there's better news. A study of California's welfare reform shows that programs emphasizing job search, education and training can increase earnings by sizable amounts and also cut welfare outlays. Even better, the earnings boost for individuals gets bigger over time -- inviting hope that small change might eventually yield large gains.   California's welfare program mirrors the Family Support Act, a 1988 Federal reform, and incorporates President Clinton's call for reciprocal obligation. Welfare parents continue to get benefits, but in exchange agree to participate in programs designed to get them into steady jobs. The California plan places welfare recipients in literacy, schooling, job-search and training programs. It provides transportation and child care while recipients enroll in the program, and continues child care for a year after they locate jobs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930422","headline":"DEATH IN WACO: Washington Memo; A Strategy of Openness Aims to Avert Backlash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/us/death-in-waco-washington-memo-a-strategy-of-openness-aims-to-avert-backlash.html","abstract":"  Hoping to win public understanding for its tear gas assault on the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Tex., senior officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation held an unusually elaborate three-hour briefing with reporters today to describe the reasoning behind their attack.

The Justices appeared decidedly sympathetic as Wisconsin's Attorney General, James E. Doyle, in an hourlong argument, defended his state's hate crime law. The case has split civil liberties groups and plunged the Court back into the debate over hate crimes for the second year in a row.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930422","headline":"A Book's Dark Tales Of Bush's Arts Agency","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/books/a-book-s-dark-tales-of-bush-s-arts-agency.html","abstract":"  John E.

Sununu, President Bush's former chief of staff, as the main culprit in sabotaging his agency.

Her voice is distorted, too: amplified and computer processed, it sounds like a metallic chorus, both frightened and frightening, and more cynical than hopeful. A Hebrew text is projected on the woman's shawl, and as she sways in a pool of light at the center of a nearly dark stage, she looks more like a ghostly holograph than like a real person.
