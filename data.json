After 10 years of honoring rock's pioneers and innovators with a night of improvised jams, confessional speeches and other surprises, it is turning into a ritual that one day may be as formal, as rigid and as respected as the Grammys. The fact that in September a giant shrine of steel and glass called the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is to open in Cleveland will add more prestige and convention to the ceremony, which is scheduled to move from New York to Cleveland in 1997.   While an annual event like this is a positive achievement for rock-and-roll, it's important that the Hall of Fame's big night not lose the spontaneity and energy that defines the music it celebrates. In ceremonies past, the speeches were followed by jam sessions where anything could happen, and usually did.

Kennedy and Newark International, which are operated under long-term leases by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. If privatization means bringing in private management to do a better job, it is worth exploring. But outright sale would be foolish. Responsible officials need firm control over facilities that are central to the area's role as a hub of national and international commerce and travel.   The question comes up because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governors George Pataki and Christine Todd Whitman, all Republicans, are bent on having private interests take over public services wherever possible, and are all strapped for cash.  The Mayor and the Governors have separate official interests. The cities of New York and Newark own the airport land. The Governors, watched over by Port Authority bondholders, jointly control the Authority and thus the airport management. But overriding their parochial perspectives, all three should have one paramount concern -- the quality and capacity of these facilities. Ranked among the world's principal airports, they are and will continue to be key to the region's growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/nyregion/news-summary-702995.html","abstract":"  International 3-6  CLINTON CHIDES RUSSIA ON ATTACK    President Clinton broke his silence about the Russian attack on a secessionist region, urging that the military action be halted but saying that aid to Russia should not be cut back because of the crisis. 1","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"Japanese Tire Maker Clashes With Labor Chief Over Strike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/us/japanese-tire-maker-clashes-with-labor-chief-over-strike.html","abstract":"  Over the past week, the head of the American operations of the giant Bridgestone Corporation of Japan has rebuffed repeated appeals from Labor Secretary Robert B.

Set in an antiseptic-looking diner (designed by Ms. Mosakowski) that recalls the futurist fantasies of the 1960's, the one-hour play assembles four characters of allegorically significant professions who make the disenfranchised boozers of \"Iceman\" seem rock solid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"63 Teams Taking Part in Meet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/sports/sports-people-high-schools-63-teams-taking-part-in-meet.html","abstract":"  Tomorrow's Archbishop Molloy Games, a track and field meet at the Armory, features a 63-team field from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia.

The city early on adopted jazz as a spiritual cause, and it was manifested in French films -- the soundtrack for Louis Malle's \"Ascenseur Pour l'Echafaud,\" with its chillingly moody music by Miles Davis, or Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless,\" with music by Martial Solal. Though American jazz musicians moved to Paris early on, and were performing there by 1919, it was after World War II that jazz blended with existentialism and was imported to the United States through film with a European beat sophistication.   But the bohemian vision created by the movies isn't quite right any more, as jazz has blended as easily with bourgeois society as it did with beat culture. In Paris, jazz is all over the city, and its audience isn't enveloped in a romantic Gauloise haze. Parisians still get nostalgic about the golden age, but their city today has an astounding variety and richness to its music. Jazz has become part of the city's consciousness in a way that challenges even New York. People go out, and they go out to relax, and listen.

The plants are pushed and pushed with water, fertilizer and warm rooms. There is never any time off, never a time to luxuriate in a dormant period.   But a dormant period is often just what house plants, like their outdoor cousins, are in need of. Not all of them, of course, but most of them, and foremost of all, Clivia.

To Jan. 29. 463-5672. \n\nAs more recognition is given to the spiritual content in midcentury American abstraction, Mark Tobey's substantial reputation becomes even more significant. This small exhibition of 15 prints from the Hofstra Museum collection, all executed in the two years before the artist's death in 1976 at age 86, is valuable as a review of Tobey's achievements and as a demonstration of the range of motifs he explored with the calligraphy-inspired thin marks that are usually termed his \"white writing.\" Frequently reproduced examples from museum collections tend to narrow public conceptions of his imagery, which is unfortunate. This show and a recent exhibition at the Yoshii Gallery in Manhattan suggest the wide scope of his themes and pictorial ideas.\n\nTobey's luminous marks sometimes rush over the entire surface and sometimes are made to seem compressed.

In \"Patterns and Poetry: No Robes From the Lucy Truman Aldrich Collection\" (through next Sunday), Susan Hay, curator of costume and textiles, sought to make a virtue of limited gallery space by using a compact design that would show the costumes in a dramatic context. Though the original proposals called for concrete structures, David Harvey, the exhibition designer, credits budgetary constraints with forcing an appropriate solution -- the illusion of an architectural setting, in this case a 16th-century No stage at the Nishi Honganji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. In so doing he followed the Japanese principle that finds beauty in the absence or elimination of everything unnecessary.

So much is out of his control. The other day, a seemingly respectable tenant was arrested on child abuse charges, and another apartment was empty. The week before, he thought he finally had a fifth-floor walk-up rented until the prospective tenant climbed the endless stairs one last time.   So the owner of four small South Bronx buildings with 38 units now has six empty apartments, and feels like a farmer gazing at a hail-ravaged field.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"Lorraine Dobbs and Eli Yamin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/style/weddings-lorraine-dobbs-and-eli-yamin.html","abstract":"  Lorraine Maybel Dobbs, a daughter of Doris A.

No master of the written word, Mr. Schulke is instead an insightful photographer whose shots transcend his sometimes sentimental and awkward prose. Mr. Schulke, a veteran photojournalist, makes the atmosphere -- the despair and the exhilaration -- palpable in his images, which begin with King's funeral in 1968, then backtrack to the 1963 funeral of Medgar Evers, whose death, Mr. Schulke writes, was \"the first murder of a black civil rights leader the media had paid any attention to.\" The iconography of the civil rights movement is hauntingly familiar: beefy, helmeted police officers and sheriffs' deputies, nightsticks at the ready, lips tight and implacable; demonstrators, black and white, seemingly fixed in time and place by their dedication to the cause of equal rights. Mr. Schulke frequently compromised his credentials as an impartial observer; even King once rebuked him with the warning, \"You have to stay back and not listen to your guts.\" His dislike of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace became so intense, Mr. Schulke writes, that he felt compelled to turn down magazine assignments about him. His pictures of Federal marshals, armed segregationists and protesters illustrate his recollections of tear gas, Molotov cocktails and sniper bullets. This is the third book Mr. Schulke has produced about King, with whom his relationship sounds intimate and genuine. \"He'd give you a hug,\" Mr. Schulke writes, \"and you would die for the man.\" LYNN KARPEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"What's Up -- and What's Going Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/realestate/what-s-up-and-what-s-going-up.html","abstract":"  A YEAR ago, Costas Kondylis, one of the city's most employed, most pragmatic apartment tower architects, had 13 people working for him.

But he had a peculiar psychological quirk: whenever he was ambivalent about a course of action (which was often), he tended to make up his mind by firing off a letter declaring vociferously for the contrary of what he would eventually do. This was true of matters as weighty as accepting a contract for an opera and as slight as permitting the transposition of an aria, or even sending a list of his decorations and honors to the Italian senate.   So when Giulio Ricordi, the scion of the house that published Verdi's operas, set about persuading Verdi to touch up \"Simon Boccanegra,\" an 1857 score that was not getting performed and therefore not bringing in any royalties, he may not have been totally discouraged to receive the following communication: \"I received yesterday a large parcel which I suppose to be a score of 'Simone.'

As it turned out, Mr. Dohnanyi and his players produced an exemplary recorded cycle. His tempos and dynamics were more fluid than Szell's, and the orchestra's sound was sometimes better focused and more thrilling. But perhaps because of the current recording glut, the set is now overlooked. When critics draw up lists of favorite Beethoven recordings, they tend to skip directly from Szell and other past masters to the hottest newcomers, neglecting the middle ground.

The stars were a pair of well-established dancers, the regal El Camborio and his fiery partner, Lucia Real. They clattered across the floor loudly and rhythmically, their hips and torsos swaying and shaking in creative combinations of classic flamenco moves. Like all outstanding flamenco artists, they kept their arms, hands and fingers in ceaseless, evocative motion. This aspect of flamenco is perhaps the most direct evidence of its roots in southern Asia, the original home of the Gypsies who developed it.    Modeled after the 16th-century popular theaters known as corrales de comedias, Corral de la Moreria is musty with tradition. A full menu is available, but most patrons around me made do with glasses of red wine, counting on the show to provide the evening's sensory delights. They were not disappointed. The dancers overflowed with emotion, and they were expertly accompanied by stylized guitar music and jaleo, the clapping and calling that is integral to the performance. The jaleadores achieved a perfect balance between spontaneity and restraint, keeping rhythm while adding a rustic element that recalls flamenco's rural origins. Theirs is a practiced art, and a patron would no more join in the clapping than he would bring a toy banjo and strum along with the guitarists.   Flashy and colorful, wild but also highly ritualized, flamenco dancing has become an instantly recognized symbol of Spanish culture. Its rich history reflects that of Andalusia, the sunny and fertile region of southern Spain where it was born. It shows influences from the Islamic and Jewish cultures that once flourished in the region, and even from Roman dances, which arrived 20 centuries ago. But it was the Gypsies who were to flamenco \"like rice to paella,\" in the words of the historian Fernando Quinones, \"the unifying and fundamental element.\"    Flamenco has become an international art form, with schools all over the world, including several hundred in Japan. Less overtly erotic than other Latin forms, like the tango and the samba, still it is nothing if not sensual. According to Andalusian tradition, the best dancers are not young or conventionally attractive, but mature and heavy-set, their legs thick and muscular from years of practice.   Foreign interest in flamenco began as part of the wave of fascination with Spain kindled by the Romantic movement, and attracted artists ranging from Gustave Dore to Rimsky-Korsakov to Washington Irving. They and other early tourists in Spain often sought to visit academies where flamenco was taught, and in response to their interest, \"cafes cantantes\" opened in many Andalusian towns. It was their successors that I wanted to find.   My appetite whetted in Madrid, with three companions I set out for Seville, home port of conquistadors and Andalusia's largest and most important city. We traveled aboard the high-speed train that was built to serve visitors to the 1992 world exposition there. The trip, which only four years ago lasted the better part of a day, now takes just two and a half hours. The ride was smooth and the airline-style service courteously efficient as we sped southward.   Romances between dancers and bullfighters are the stuff of countless legends and stories still told in Andalusia, so it was fitting that both of the flamenco bars we visited in Seville were in the shadow of the famous Maestranza bullring. The shows reflected very different aspects of flamenco's modern face.   El Patio Sevillano is a large room decorated in Andalusian patio style, with ceramic tiles and engravings of the city. Patrons are often packed close together, although on the night we visited the place was not crowded. We sat by the side of the stage, near an elegant Spanish gentleman, clearly an enthusiast, who called out encouragement to the dancers at the right moments.   The show was centered on but not limited to classical flamenco. Some of the numbers were closer to ballet; others resembled popular dance. One was even performed to the recorded strains of the overture from \"Carmen,\" which outsiders often take to be the quintessential Andalusian anthem but which was in fact composed by Georges Bizet, who was French, and has little if anything to do with flamenco.   The troupe at El Patio Sevillano totaled 14 dancers, guitarists and jaleadores. As soon as one number was over, the dancers rushed upstairs to change into new costumes while others took the stage. This was a highly polished show, ready to be lifted intact by some ambitious promoter who wanted to introduce Spanish dancing abroad. Purists might scorn some parts of it, but the per formers were accomplished professionals. The jaleadores added an air of authenticity to a show that was aimed mainly at tourists.   The next night we visited a smaller tavern, El Arenal. Housed in a 17th-century building on a small, hard-to-find alley, its walls are covered with drawings of flamenco dancers and scenes of senoritas flirting with bullfighters. While the show was not as seamlessly choreographed as others we had seen, it was probably the most authentic we saw in Spain. The dancers performed with unbridled emotion, seemingly heedless of the audience. \"This time I feel like I'm sitting around a Gypsy campfire,\" one of my companions said as we sipped our sangria.   We were disappointed to find no flamenco being performed in Cordoba during our visit, and traveled with high hopes from there to our final stop, Granada. Home to the legendary Alhambra, the Moorish castle that is the most popular tourist attraction in Spain, Granada is always packed with tourists, and flamenco shows are part of the standard fare.   Following the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel, we chose a place called Jardines de Neptuno. We should have balked when the concierge told us that a bus would pick us up at the hotel. We began to worry when the bus stopped at several other hotels, filled up with tourists, and then parked at our destination behind two other full-sized buses. Inside, the showplace was a three-sided arena with sloping rows like those at a sports stadium, and seats for 800 patrons. As far as we could tell, there was not a single Spaniard in the house, and understandably so. The show was painfully commercial, a virtually unrecognizable mixture of flamenco, salsa and various other Latin styles.   Most of the performers at Jardines de Neptuno were Hollywood-pretty, but the choreographers were evidently unconcerned with authenticity. The spectators didn't seem to mind. They chattered loudly in English and German, and one man in the front row clapped incessantly along with the jaleadores as if he were at a sing-along festival. We confronted the concierge later, and he replied with a philosophical shrug. \"If flamenco is alive today,\" he said, \"it is because of tourists.\"   In 1922, the composer Manuel de Falla and the poet Federico Garcia Lorca, among others, organized a flamenco festival in Granada to revive its classical roots. Aficionados in the city this year for the weeklong Flamenco Encounter in Granada (to be held in either June or October) or in Cordoba for the Flamenco-Guitar Festival (two weeks in July, still to be designated) can follow suit by immersing themselves in the art of flamenco. Those in Seville may catch sight of the filming, beginning next week, of \"Flamenco,\" a movie by Carlos Saura. \"Other forms of popular music come and go,\" he said, \"but flamenco is constantly renewing itself. This is an especially good moment -- lots of exciting new performers.\" WHERE TO GO TO WATCH THE DANCERS    For information about flamenco festivals, write to the National Tourist Office of Spain, 665 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022.

Most public schools, with just a percentage of these children, have a hard enough time coping. Recruiting at-risk students and then nurturing them into their middle-school years might seem a thankless task.\n\nBut that is the basic concept of the Children's Community School on Wolcott Street in Waterbury and rather than facing failure, it celebrated its 25th anniversary last year. The school has 79 students this year in grades kindergarten through fifth, all in small, intimate classrooms.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"'Shadows of ther Mind'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/books/l-shadows-of-ther-mind-617195.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Although this is not the place to enter into a discussion of Hilary Putnam's various comments concerning my book 'Shadows of the Mind,\" I cannot let pass his continuing claim that I have not even considered the possibility that mathematicians might act according to a nonunderstandable computer program.

Hotels and cultural sites on the island off the east coast of Africa had fallen into disrepair owing to government neglect. But in the last few years, the Government (Zanzibar and Tanganyika united in 1964 to become Tanzania) has encouraged tourism investment, and improved facilities have begun drawing travelers, many of them adding stops on Zanzibar to longer East Africa tours. One of the island's chief attractions is the Stone Town section of the city of Zanzibar, with its narrow, winding streets and balconied limestone houses with ornately carved doors. Visitors also may tour farms where clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom are grown, or swim at Indian Ocean beaches.    One company that operates East African tours, Wildlife Safari, offers a two-night stay on Zanzibar before any of its trips. Participants stay in the Dhow Palace, a Stone Town house converted to a 10-room hotel.  The cost of $295 a person, based on two in a room, includes breakfast and sightseeing.  Travel to Zanzibar is usually by a flight from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian coast, followed by a 22-mile hydrofoil ride. Round-trip fare is $300, according to the company. Wildlife Safari offers a free three-night stay on Zanzibar to anyone about to take its 15-day Wings Over Kenya (land cost from $3,195 a person ) or Kenya Under Canvas (from $3,795) tours.

President Clinton quickly selected Mr. Aspin to run it. Not enough has happened since.    Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress have appointed the eight members of the panel the legislature was authorized to select. Mr. Aspin and President Clinton have yet to name eight others the White House gets to appoint.

Its initial reception at the Metropolitan Opera in 1958 was wildly enthusiastic; Dimitri Mitropoulos, who conducted the first performance, exclaimed, \"At last, an American grand opera!\" But the Met lost interest in the work a few years later, and Cecil Beaton's sumptuous sets were destroyed in a 1973 fire. The Washington Opera's visually splendid new staging, a co-production with the Dallas Opera that opened on Saturday at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, is one of very few attempts at this score in recent decades.   The principal reason for the opera's neglect is probably Gian Carlo Menotti's soggy libretto, which aims for the Gothic passions of Isak Dinesen and the subtle epiphanies of Chekhov but instead achieves a kind of uneventful, unpoetic melodrama. Vanessa, the melancholy aristocrat, falls for the young, caddish Anatol, the son of her former lover. Erika, her no less melancholy niece, also sleeps with Anatol, becomes pregnant and aborts her child to avoid compromising her aunt. Vanessa goes off with Anatol, unaware of his worthlessness, while Erika stays home and withdraws from the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950116","headline":"A Feud Begins Among Simpson's Lawyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/16/us/a-feud-begins-among-simpson-s-lawyers.html","abstract":"  As O.
