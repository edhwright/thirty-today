It has an inherent blend of athleticism, grace and glitter that spell marketability. It gets superb television ratings.

The words were neither a \"challenge\" to Mr. Bawer's relationship nor a \"telling slip\" showing subconscious disrespect. Nor were they a statement that our ability to procreate makes my husband and me qualitatively different from those involved in single-sex relationships. The words were a statement of the ardent love that my husband and I share, and a celebration of every other relationship founded on passion, friendship and honor. BONNIE G. KLEIN  Falls Church, Va. Margaret O'Brien Steinfels replies:   The letters address my proposition that \"society has a legitimate interest in privileging those heterosexual unions that are oriented toward the generation and rearing of children,\" but do not directly attack it. Instead, they emphasize the ways in which legal marriage departs from this role, embracing not only the infertile and adoptive, but increasingly the intentionally childless. If we've gone this far, the letter writers ask, why stop here? Why exclude gay people?   I agree that American society seems to be moving from an understanding of marriage largely in terms of family and intergenerational ties to one that emphasizes intimacy and the fulfillment of two individuals. Appealing to this movement as a precedent is not convincing to those who believe that it has already gone too far. None of the letters mention the most dramatic example of the way in which family life has changed -- namely, the rapid rise in out-of-wedlock births and children living in single-parent or no-parent households. There are people who argue that to avoid stigmatization, we should regard these nontraditional forms as normal. But this social experiment of only some 25 years' duration is failing large numbers of children and women. This underlines the enormous social benefit that comes when two people vow not only to care for each other but to sustain the kind of relationship commonly involving several decades of caring for the next generation. That is why I suspect society will want marriages recognized as qualitatively different from other relationships.   I suggested that this widespread concern remains high on the agenda for the dialogue that I believed Mr. Bawer was advancing. His letter implies that dialogue is conditional on prior agreement. He believes that warning of the psychological consequences to gay people and their families of rejection resolves the \"family\" issue. But nowhere does he address the social and political concerns I raise. It is here that his metaphor, \"a place at the table,\" misleads. No nation is one big happy family, least of all our own. Our genius has been to transcend family limitations to create a public space where all of us may interact, if only to agree to disagree. The entrance ticket is tolerance, not approval.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"'Most Expensive' School District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/nyregion/l-most-expensive-school-district-862088.html","abstract":"  \"Most Expensive District,\" the Dec. 12 article about the Union County Regional High School District, has some omissions and misstatements.

A small industrial park in the Naugatuck Valley would seem an unlikely place to spawn such a sophisticated sled.

The controversy reached a fever pitch in November when The Village Voice published a full-page broadside by the reviewer Kevin Whitehead that questioned the program's motives and philosophy in extremely combative terms. The program's artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, was so infuriated by the Whitehead piece, which came on the heels of another full-page critique only a month earlier by The Voice's regular jazz reviewer, Gary Giddins, that he wrote a 2,500-word response challenging Mr. Whitehead's premises and conclusions.

But the real questions underlying WHO STOLE THE NEWS? Why We Can't Keep Up With What Happens in the World and What We Can Do About It (Wiley, $24.95) are a bit more mundane: what is news, and why doesn't anyone seem to care much about anything beyond the immediately domestic? Americans are infamous around the world for being uninterested in things foreign -- a foolish attitude on a planet whose nations are more and more interlinked, Mr. Rosenblum argues. Television and the profit motive are the primary culprits keeping the population mired in ignorance, he contends. News organizations forgo foreign news because there is scant consumer interest. No surprises there. Yet given the low priority assigned most foreign events by news media executives, it is still possible for citizens to obtain the information necessary to make informed judgments. Readers must simply hunt it down in newspapers, magazines and journals. Much, of course, depends on the quality of reporting itself, and here is where Mr. Rosenblum is most interesting. He laces his argument with numerous examples of the trials, woes and infelicities endemic to reporting abroad. His devastating portrait of American military censorship during the Persian Gulf war and of the timidity and smugness of the press during that conflict is particularly noteworthy. The fact is that no one stole the news.

This was particularly true in the United States, where the antiwar, free speech and civil rights movements had inspired artists and graphic designers to create reams of visual agitation -- some of which became icons of the era. Memorable graphics were noticeably absent during the 1970's. Yet by the 80's, concurrent with Ronald Reagan's Administration, social and political activism was again on the rise throughout the world, and so were political graphics. Liz McQuiston, a graphic design critic and historian in London, surveys the wide range of graphic arts produced internationally during the past three decades in GRAPHIC AGITATION: Social and Political Graphics Since the Sixties (Phaidon/Chronicle, $49.95). The book is the first comprehensive overview of these posters, billboards, flyers, periodicals, buttons and T-shirts. Ms. McQuiston writes that during the 70's the environment and human rights were significant issues, and not until the 80's did social movements and individuals refocus their attention on community issues and redirect their efforts toward producing visual propaganda. Sexual orientation and AIDS became focal points for artists, many of whom belonged to poster brigades and graphics collectives and engaged in guerrilla activities that included billboard defacement and illegal bill posting. Ms. McQuiston offers an extensive collection of both familiar and rare materials gathered from scores of grass-roots and urban advocacy groups. The effectiveness of recent productless, issue-oriented advertisements for mainstream businesses (such as those for Benetton) is also scrutinized. This ambitious chronicle is a must for the scholars, students and practitioners of alternative media.

Yes, \"Erwartung\": 32 minutes of atonal hysteria without a backbeat, electronic keyboards or mystical mantras. Is the angst of Expressionism ready to return, sweeping away Minimalist cool in its Eastern and Western guises? Perhaps, but I suspect that the sales success of Schoenberg's nightmare monodrama shows something else: that the long-term viability of musical works has nothing to do with intellectual fashions or fleeting marketing strategies.   On college campuses 25 years ago, Schoenberg was the hero of 20th-century music, and \"Erwartung\" was considered his masterpiece. Here was a work that threw out all the machinery of 19th-century music: no tonality, no themes, no tunes, no repetition and, perhaps most important, no pandering to the public. \"Today the only works which really count are those which are no longer works at all,\" wrote the philosopher Theodor Adorno in 1948. \"Erwartung\" summed up every radical tendency of the century, including contempt for the very category of masterpiece. The fact that the public hated it only increased its intellectual cachet at the time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940116","headline":"Momism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/books/momism.html","abstract":"  RECONCEIVING WOMEN Separating Motherhood From Female Identity.

Although priorities at the start of the legislative sessions each January just sometimes emerge as laws and programs from budget battles and the harried bargaining at sessions' ends in June or July, pivotal measures for Long Island are in the wings. \n\nIn one example the shootings on the Long Island Rail Road last month appear to be adding impetus to a proposal by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to ban weapons like the 9-millimeter gun used by the accused gunman, Colin Ferguson. Long Island legislators will most likely want to go further. The Island delegation overwhelmingly supports restoring the death penalty, the centerpiece of a series of anticrime bills. Some Long Island legislators are among its sponsors. Mr. Cuomo has said he would seek life imprisonment without parole after a person's third conviction for a violent crime. Mr. Cuomo has vetoed all previous attempts to restore the death penalty. Attempts to override the vetoes have failed.\nNo Single Rallying Point \n\n Mr. Cuomo appears to be setting the legislative agenda.

By today's supposedly rational standards, it may be grandiose, inefficient, even wasteful; yet it is also comfortably solid, an endearing relic of an era that through the distorting lens of time seems simpler and more emotionally direct.   By the time Korngold composed the suite, in 1930, Schoenberg and his school had already wrung what they considered useful out of the densely chromatic late Romantic style, and were hoping to discover a new world beyond tonality. Korngold, like Richard Strauss, demurred, believing that there was life in tonality yet. Here he used traditional forms -- a prelude and fugue, a lilting Viennese waltz and a set of variations -- as well as freer structures. But the forms did not constrain his imagination: color, sentimentality and even a kind of cinematic drama pour out of the piece.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940117","headline":"Julie C.

(AP) Wachter Wins Again: Anita Wachter of Austria scored her third World Cup victory of the season, beating Deborah Compagnoni, a hometown hero, in a giant slalom in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy. Wachter, the World Cup champion, dominated a highly technical race by clocking the fastest time in both runs down the Olimpia Tofane course. Her total time was 2 minutes 38.80 seconds as Compagnoni finished .73 seconds behind. (AP)   TRACK AND FIELD  Ford Games Showcase  Lyria Martin, a La Guardia High School sophomore, and William Arnold, a Bishop Ford junior, turned in impressive performances yesterday in the Bishop Ford games at the West 168th Street Armory. More than 1,500 boys and girls from 73 Eastern high schools took part in the meet. Martin, the Eastern states outdoor 100-meter champion, won the girls 55-meter dash in 7 seconds flat. Martin's time was 40.5 seconds. Arnold, winner of the mile at Brown University last month in 4 minutes 22.9 seconds, waited until the final turn to pass the leader, Jim Colling, the Virginia state mile champion from Chantilly, to win in 4:25.0. Colling, running his first indoor race this season, was second in 4:26.2. Bruce Rosado, another Ford runner who won the 800 meters at Brown in 1:59.3, kicked down the final straightaway to win the 1,000-meter run in 2:34.8.  HORSE RACING  Diazo a Disappointment  Zignew, a 21-1 long shot, took the lead inside the eighth pole and scored a 1 3/4-length victory yesterday in the $225,500 San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita in Acadia, Calif. Zignew held off the stretch drives of Nonproductiveasset and Pacific Tango for her fifth victory in 12 starts. The winner covered a mile and an eighth in 1:47 4/5 and paid $44.80, $20.60 and $11.60 for $2 across the board. Diazo, the 17-10 favorite with stablemate Stuka, was kept in good position behind pace-setter Bat Eclat during the first mile of the Grade II event for 4-year-olds. That's when Zignew passed Del Mar Dennis and Diazo at the top of the stretch and went on to win the second leg of the Strub Series. Diazo, trained by Bill Shoemaker and ridden by Laffit Pincay, captured the first leg when he won the Malibu Stakes on Dec. 26. He was ninth in the 12-horse field yesterday.

The silent-film star's dreamy, languid gaze appears on screens mounted in a set resembling the lobby of a 1920's movie theater. A voice, ostensibly from an early Victrola, begins to sing in the style of Rudy Vallee, mourning the passing of the screen idol. The pop lyrics are first overlaid with the sound of a male chorus intoning the Latin Requiem, then with the vocalizing of a soprano, and finally, with loving declarations by a woman in black. There are five singing lines going at once in clashing keys and styles.   It is a daring way to open an opera, even for someone as lyrically gifted as Mr. Argento. And for all the awkwardness of the first night's performance of this opening gambit, it was clear that it was meant to suggest momentous grandeur, religious pomp, pop sentimentality and personal devotion, all combined into a contradictory whole.

That's the clearest way to describe their politically motivated plan that would scuttle an assault weapon ban by tacking on a provision to install the death penalty in New York State.   Gov. Mario Cuomo has vetoed the death penalty 11 consecutive times; he would be right to do it again. The death penalty takes lives, sometimes in error, but statistics show it does not deter crime. Placing the death penalty and the assault weapon ban together in a single bill virtually assures a veto by the Governor -- and thus assault weapons would remain legal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940117","headline":"About Sunday Weddings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/17/style/weddings-about-sunday-weddings.html","abstract":"  Starting next weekend, marriages scheduled for Sunday will be reported on the day of the wedding, in Styles of The Times.

During the last 25 years, his plays -- 40 of them since he originated his Ontological-Hysteric Theater -- have repeatedly analyzed the imbalances between art and life. Even while he has branched out to become a director of opera and plays by others, his contribution remains instantly identifiable. Whatever he does, he leaves sight and sound tracks as his signature, and his art has always had a deeply intellectual foundation.   In rehearsal at St. Mark's Theater with his new play, \"My Head Was a Sledgehammer,\" Mr. Foreman is at the electronic controls, interjecting suggestions to his actors and orchestrating the mechanics of the enterprise. With a mournful mien that extends from his eyes to his mustache, he is a younger, avant-garde doppelganger of Broadway's David Merrick. As the author fine-tunes the performance, a spiderlike chandelier revolves like a fan in a Singapore hotel; string -- a Foreman trademark -- crisscrosses and stratifies the stage, and Oriental carpets cushion the walls.

But there is more to theater in Germany, and even in Hamburg, than the Thalia. Right now, the hot item in the German-speaking theater world is the Thalia's main Hamburg rival, the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, or German Theater.   The Schauspielhaus is in the news because of the arrival this season of Frank Baumbauer as its new intendant, or director. Mr. Baumbauer, 48, comes from Munich and got started there and in Dusseldorf as a stage director. From 1983 to 1986 he was intendant at the Bavarian State Theater in Munich and, after a year's stopover in Stuttgart, served from 1988 to 1993 as director of the Basel Theater in Switzerland, where he was in charge of the entire theatrical operation, including opera and dance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940118","headline":"Knight's New Shoe Fits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/sports/sports-people-basketball-knight-s-new-shoe-fits.html","abstract":"  Coach BOB KNIGHT of Indiana has signed a five-year contract for the Hoosiers to wear the Converse Run 'N Slam basketball shoes.

That is what Mr. Giuliani is learning the hard way, as he tries to assert his will in the aftermath of the recent melee at a Harlem mosque. He is learning, too, that preconceived notions about how government should work have little to do with how it does work.

Not Yet.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/opinion/trust-assad-not-yet.html","abstract":"After their marathon meeting in Geneva on Sunday, President Clinton was asked if he felt that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had made a firm commitment to normalize relations with Israel. Without hesitation, Mr. Clinton replied, \"The short answer is yes.\"\n Well, maybe. Mr. Assad's record suggests that it is wise to be skeptical about his intentions. As in the bad old days when he was a Soviet client, he still engages in aggressive activities, aimed mostly at Israel, Turkey, Lebanon and the United States. They include the following:\n * Building up Syrian unconventional military capabilities. Damascus now has thousands of chemical warheads, appears to be on the verge of putting anthrax agents into weapons and is starting nuclear research. Its Scud-C missiles from North Korea can reach most of Israel's population.\n * Getting more involved in the drug trade. Top officials participate in trafficking drugs to the West, according to a 1992 Congressional report.\n * Sponsoring Lebanese and Palestinian groups that attack Israelis as well as Palestinians who favor Yasir Arafat, and sponsoring the PKK, a Kurdish Marxist group, in its assaults on Turkey.\n\n* Nurturing an alliance with Iran. So close is this bond, the Syrians have distributed counterfeit U.S. currency produced in Iran, according to a report by the House Republican Research Committee.\n In short, Mr. Assad's policies have made Syria one of the Middle East's rogue states, along with Libya, Iraq and Iran. No less important, Mr. Assad represses his own people with a harshness second only to Saddam Hussein's. But while Washington puts pressure on the other rogue states by working to isolate them, it woos Syria. Rather than isolating the regime, it has tried for years to bring Syria into the \"family of nations.\" Our diplomats hold out small bait to encourage cooperation; last month, for example, we permitted Syria to acquire American-made jets. Secretaries of State and other dignitaries regularly travel to Damascus, and now four U.S. Presidents have met with Mr. Assad. Our companies operate in Syria almost without restrictions.\n Mr. Assad has avoided the harsh treatment dealt to Muammar el-Qaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Iran's mullahs because he's smarter than they are. He makes gestures at the right time and plays complicated double games. He keeps diplomatic links open and accommodates when necessary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940118","headline":"Hall's Hurley Explains","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/sports/sports-people-basketball-hall-s-hurley-explains.html","abstract":"  Depression, lack of self-esteem and difficulty dealing with stress led to DANNY HURLEY's decision to take a leave of absence from Seton Hall's basketball team on Dec. 4, the junior guard has said in an interview with several New Jersey newspapers.   \"I had it in my head that anything short of being an N.B.A. player, I'm a failure,\" he said. \"When I wasn't performing like an N.B.A. player, I started getting depressed.\" (AP)  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940118","headline":"The Veep Signs On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/opinion/the-veep-signs-on.html","abstract":"  The Clintons' style of damage control has certain hallmarks that have been on clear display since the 1992 campaign.

Five Yankees are expected to exchange salary figures with the team as part of the arbitration process today.   Velarde, 31 years old, started at four positions last season and batted .301 in 85 games. He is likely to compete with Mike Gallego for the shortstop job, unless one of them is traded. Had injuries not sidelined Velarde for almost two months, he might have attempted to have his salary determined by an arbiter again.
