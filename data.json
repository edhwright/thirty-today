When he takes violent action, is he acting out of some innate immorality? Or is he another victim of a society that abandoned him?   The director, Ildiko Szabo, has created a precise and moving route to these larger questions. The scenes of Zsolt painstakingly bathing his grandmother, singing to her and helping her put on her wig and makeup each morning are presented with an eerie fascination. \"It's morning,\" reads a sign Zsolt leaves on the blackboard for her. \"Everything is on the table.\" Each scene evokes pathos without sentimentality.

A nervous teen-ager named Johnny Garcia walks into a video rental club in a high-rise building. The club is really a front for an illegal foreign-money exchange, and Johnny is no innocent himself. He pulls a gun out of his brightly colored school backpack and lets several older, more obviously threatening cohorts into the room. Before they can escape with the cash, the police are alerted, the robbers become accidental hostage-holders and the entire incident is broadcast live on television. With armed police on the streets and venomous reporters at the door, Johnny flirts with Gloria, the money-changer's seductive secretary and lover.    Based on an actual botched-and-broadcast robbery that took place in Santiago in 1990, the film is an effective satire of the news media and even makes some glancing political comments. But \"Johnny 100 Pesos\" works best as a smart thriller with dark comic undertones.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940402","headline":"Saving More Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/opinion/saving-more-children.html","abstract":"  Could Shayna Bryant have been saved?

But it also seemed that all that was needed was a few more performances to work out matters of detail, tone and structure.   The promise of these concerts could be heard in the final movement, Mahler's most haunting Adagio, which invokes kitsch and sentimentality, sarcasm and mockery, only to subsume them into an extended hymn that in its final pages can suspend the motion of time. Here Mr. Masur shaped arching, heartfelt phrases, allowing the movement to become a long, tragic sigh.

Tournament; Four Teams With One Goal Yet to Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/sports/ncaa-tournament-four-teams-with-one-goal-yet-to-go.html","abstract":"  They have heard, for years, about The Road to this place. They watched teams of the past make similar journeys, all the way to the climax of the college basketball season, and wondered what the trip would be like. And now that they have survived to this point in an unpredictable season -- with Arkansas, Arizona and Florida in search of their first national championship and Duke trying for a third one in four years -- four semifinalists are left with the hope of a memorable weekend.   Arkansas will meet Arizona late Saturday afternoon (Channel 2 at 5:42 P.M.), before first-time semifinalist Florida opposes Duke to determine the Monday night finalists of the national collegiate tournament.  Metal Detectors at the Gates    An event that did not become the anticipated coronation of the 1993 champion North Carolina Tar Heels includes just one of the four teams seeded No. 1 in the regionals -- the Razorbacks of Arkansas, who are expected to receive the support of President Clinton.   The involvement of the President, who watched the Razorbacks win the Midwest championship last Sunday in Dallas, has given this tournament a fan of unusually high profile, and has created the need for metal detectors at the gates of the Charlotte Coliseum.   \"As long as he shakes my hand, it'll be all right,\" said Reggie Geary, a sophomore guard from Arizona and one of the defensive strengths of the Wildcats. \"I just want to meet him.\"   The Razorbacks, 29-3, are a more experienced version of the young team that made 12 of 20 3-point shots to overcome Arizona's zone defenses in an 86-80 victory over the Wildcats in December 1992.   \"I don't think you'll see zones tomorrow,\" said Damon Stoudamire, the junior guard who directs the Wildcat offense. \"They just killed us. They hit a lot of 3-pointers. They had quick hands. Their press kind of affected us a little bit. We really didn't play that well. I think with the team that we have this year, it's totally different.\" High Speed and High Scoring    Arizona, 29-5, overcame several recent tournament disappointments to become convincing winners of the West Regional. With Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves emerging as one of the leading backcourt combinations in the country, the Wildcats have won 12 of their last 13 games by making 49.7 percent of their shots and holding the opposition to 39.6 percent. Their quick-paced, full-court approach could challenge an Arkansas team that has been comfortable at that speed and could result in a game that threatens the record of 197 combined points in a national semifinal game. (The record was set in 1965 in U.C.L.A.'s 108-89 victory over Wichita State.)   Florida, 29-7, has extended the greatest season in its 75-year history by filling the void created by North Carolina's unexpected second-round defeat. The first Final Four appearance of the Gators, just seven years after they reached this tournament for the first time, came as a result of East Regional victories over Connecticut and Boston College. Not long after Coach Lon Kruger took over a program known more for its rules violations and improper conduct of players, he has established a team now recognized for its similarities to the respected Duke program led by Mike Krzyzewski. The Message Is What Matters    \"Any similarities would be interpreted as a huge compliment,\" Kruger said. \"We're playing a game. But he uses that opportunity to really develop and get across messages to his players that they can benefit from for the rest of their lives.   \"That is the significance of what we're doing,\" Kruger said. \"Certainly, this is nice. This is big. This gets a lot of attention. But the experiences of our players from these opportunities, and how they use those later on, are really important.\" Capel Rushes to the Rescue    The Blue Devils, 27-5, were expected to take some time to adjust to the loss of graduated point guard Bobby Hurley. Senior Grant Hill and freshman Jeff Capel have played key roles in the adjustment.    \"We've had a good team without knowing who our guards were,\" said Krzyzewski. \"Whenever I've had a problem, I've always put Grant in that position. For a lot of the year he has been that guard, but you wouldn't really call him a guard. So now with Jeff emerging as he has, even though we're in the tournament, we're changing a little bit.\"   Krzyzewski chuckled at the idea, then added: \"And I'm giving him a little more responsibility, because I think he can handle it now. And I think that's been the strength of our program. We've been willing to change, even late in the year and in the N.C.A.A. tournament to take advantage of the strengths of our players. Now we have the best guard play we've had all year, and we actually have people that we call guards.\" Stronger by the Game    Led by Hill, the all-America, Duke became stronger in the last several weeks because of the improved play of center Cherokee Parks and forward Tony Lang, as well as the emergence of Capel.   \"We haven't really had a true center,\" Krzyzewski said. \"So Cherokee has taken more of a normal progression to become an outstanding player. I've seen him, in the last month, be more vocal. You'd be surprised at all levels at how little big guys talk. And so if they can talk, and say something that's really good for their teammates, it has a tremendous impact on the team.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940402","headline":"Review/Pop; From the Band, the Name and Sometimes the Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/arts/review-pop-from-the-band-the-name-and-sometimes-the-sound.html","abstract":"  The chorus of Bruce Springsteen's \"Atlantic City\" declares, \"Everything dies baby, that's a fact/But maybe everything that dies someday comes back.\" When the Band sang it at the Beacon Theater on Thursday night, it took on new resonances.

It is true that the ancient professions of faith included Jesus's burial as a basic belief: \"He was crucified under Pontius Pilate, died and was buried.\" But right from the beginning, the great controversies have not been about whether Jesus was buried but whether he stayed buried, or really died before appearing to be buried.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940402","headline":"An Ex-Minister Atones To Return to Sikh Fold","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/world/an-ex-minister-atones-to-return-to-sikh-fold.html","abstract":"  Nearly 10 years after events at the Golden Temple in Amritsar enraged Sikhs across India and led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, one of the most powerful officials in Mrs. Gandhi's Government has won forgiveness from the Sikhs' religious leadership by touring Sikh shrines performing menial acts of penance.    In a country where social and economic privilege is buttressed by a caste system, the acts of contrition performed by the former Home Affairs Minister, Buta Singh, have drawn widespread attention. For eight weeks, he has swept floors and courtyards, washed dishes and dusted shoes at the Golden Temple and other Sikh shrines in northern India.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940402","headline":"Giuliani And Rangel Strike a Deal On U.S. Aid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/nyregion/giuliani-and-rangel-strike-a-deal-on-us-aid.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

So it takes a special energy to get to know Madrid. And, because its streets are noisy, polluted and clogged with traffic on weekdays, the weekend is the best time to do so. The city has five million inhabitants and sprawls far and wide, but much of it can be ignored.

These days, Mr. Paik's focus has shifted from performance art to multi-screen television installations and global satellite productions. Nonetheless his Dadaist impulses persist, often taking the form of more subtle acts of esthetic subversion, like using magnets to destroy the normal functions of a bank of television monitors, or staging events like \"The First Accident of the 21st Century,\" a choreographed collision between a robot and an automobile driven by a friend. NAM JUNE PAIK: Video Time -- Video Space (Abrams, $49.50) is a lavishly illustrated, highly eclectic survey of the artist's career, from his early Fluxus days in Germany to his experiments with video technology and room-sized video environments in the 1970's and 80's. Rather than presenting Mr. Paik's career chronologically, the editors -- Toni Stooss, director of the Kunsthalle Vienna, and Thomas Kellein, director of the Kunsthalle Basel -- have mixed previously published articles by critics and museum curators with new writings and reminiscences by friends, fellow artists and Mr. Paik himself. The results are uneven, though there are memorable surprises, including a sly interview with John Cage, whose music was a major influence on Mr. Paik, and an evocative essay by the feminist writer Kate Millett recalling the near-utopian idealism of the New York art scene in the early 1960's. Other contributors include the architect Arata Isozaki and the poet Allen Ginsberg. This is a provocative book that chronicles not only Mr. Paik's career but also 30 years of changes in the international art world.\nANDREA BARNET","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"LONG ISLAND JOURNAL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/nyregion/long-island-journal-634115.html","abstract":"  Joie de $500 Chausseurs   IT was a party where everyone was looking at everyone's feet.

Vanderbilt University, $19.95. The Cambridge University scholars who translated the Bible for James I were neither well recompensed nor much remembered.

In 1970 our reviewer, Helen Bevington, said that Bois \"lives on as a tireless and brilliant scholar, worthy of the tremendous task.\"  CIVIL WARS By Rosellen Brown. Dell, $5.99. This 1984 novel by the author of \"Before and After\" deals with a couple whose idealism seems as worn as their marriage. It is 1978 and the Carlls, former civil rights workers who are white, find themselves unwelcome in the black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., where they've lived for many years. As a family crisis unfolds, \"this lucidly courageous book asks not only about heroes stuck in memory's groove but about us,\" Lynne Sharon Schwartz said here. A troubled union is also at the heart of Ms. Brown's TENDER MERCIES (Dell, $5.99), which explores the devastating aftermath of a boating accident in which Dan Courser permanently cripples his young wife, Laura. The novel \"contains prose as masterful, and as moving, as any being written today,\" Joyce Carol Oates said here in 1978. Dell has also reissued the author's first novel, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MY MOTHER ($5.99), in which the warring principals are a famous civil rights lawyer and her diffident daughter, a former hippie with her own hapless child. In 1976 our reviewer, Laurie Stone, said that the deep and deadly connections between mothers and daughters \"are nowhere in contemporary fiction better dramatized than here.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Belatedly, Spring Arrives, Welcome All the More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/us/belatedly-spring-arrives-welcome-all-the-more.html","abstract":"  It's about two weeks behind, but who's complaining?

Some clients want them really full, others want them pouty. Mine tend to be peaked. A lot depends upon how the lips look on the product. If it's for a soda ad, where you're sipping on a straw, they will literally Polaroid numerous girls in that exact same position to see how those lips form on the straw. \nWHY LIPS AND HANDS GO TOGETHER: In the past, they would hire someone with the perfect lips they wanted and a second person with the perfect hands and they would put them together. Now they would rather hire one person because when you use your own hands, you tend to be more expressive. \nPART THAT EARNS THE MOST MONEY: Hands. There are many more ads that use hands than just lips, but lips tend to be in more glamorous ads, unless you're doing a cold sore. \nFAVORITE COMPLIMENT: I was once referred to by a photographer who's been in the business a long time as the Frank Perdue of models because of all my fine parts. \nSOMETHING A PALM READER ONCE SAW IN MY HAND: I'd have a long life, I could be married once or twice and I'd probably have two kids.

Rock is just now reaching its 40's, too young for a golden anniversary, so seeking a golden age may be premature. But in its short existence, rock has evolved fast. Shaped and disseminated by electronic media with a short attention span, rock has gone through phases and backlashes that mimic the history of older musical and artistic forms in foreshortened ways. Its peak -- or, as I'm about to suggest, peaks -- would be measured in years rather than decades.   Any search for rock's golden age is complicated by pop's connection to youth. Most listeners remember the height of rock perfection as coinciding with their own prime years from, say, ages 16 to 23. That's when the music's promises of freedom and pleasure and power begin to ring true, as the constraints of adolescence give way to the privileges of adulthood while the responsibilities haven't yet sunk in.

Last week, Michigan questioned whether the Razorbacks could win if Corliss Williamson, their bruising 6-foot-7-inch star forward, was tripled-team. Arkansas responded with a lethal 3-point attack and eliminated the Fab Four from contention.   This evening, guard-oriented Arizona wondered how the fast-breaking Razorbacks would do if their perimeter game were taken away. Nolan Richardson, the Arkansas coach, came up with the answer to this one at intermission: He unleashed a ferocious fullcourt press and a huge dose of Williamson that ultimately broke open a close game.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"A Portraitist To Potentates Of All Stripes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/nyregion/a-portraitist-to-potentates-of-all-stripes.html","abstract":"  JIMMY CARTER once did a drawing for him.

Tires rarely go flat, and electrons have replaced rods and levers as the primary control of a car's functions.

The larger one, to which most of us belong -- the one that today's Hollywood aims at and that most critics are conscripted to write for -- enters the theater with the reduced expectations of adults. A movie is a one-night stand. You get your popcorn, you get your hit from the screen, and you walk out more or less satiated, without a backward glance. I mean this literally.    The second audience, considerably smaller, enters with the question \"Am I going to want to go back?\" Their moviegoing is prompted by a childish anticipation of finding films they can live in, and their judgments are founded in a small child's delight in repetition. The backward glance is their basic accolade. Anything that cannot withstand at least two viewings is, for them, often not worth one. Consider Oscar night from their point of view. How many times would you return to see \"The Age of Innocence\"? \"The Piano\"? \"Schindler's List\"?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Hillary Clinton Escaped Collapse in the Markets That Cost Many Fortunes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/us/hillary-clinton-escaped-collapse-in-the-markets-that-cost-many-fortunes.html","abstract":"  Fifteen years after brokers and customers at the Refco brokerage office here plucked money from the commodities markets and then watched their portfolios collapse, the office is attracting renewed attention for the role it played in earning nearly $100,000 for Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

You can work for one shoe company one day and another the next and there's no conflict. \nWORST PART: Since you're unrecognizable, you don't get residuals. \nBEST PART ABOUT BEING A HAND MODEL: You don't have to be handy, lend a hand, do the lawn. \nWORST PART: Neighbors laugh at you as your girlfriend trims the hedges. \nHOW I PREPARE FOR A FOOT JOB: I wear very loosely tied sneakers without socks so there aren't any marks left on my ankles or feet. \nHOW I BECAME A FOOT MODEL: A man's shoe usually looks best proportioned in size 8-D (a woman's is size 6-B). It's easy to find a foot that size and put a shoe and sock on it, but if you take all that off and do a bare foot, that's more lucrative and I have pretty decent feet if I maintain them. \nWHERE I GET MY PEDICURE: Gold Finger in South Orange, N.J. The trick is to have the nails shaped consistently across the tips of the toes so the foot looks balanced. \nSOMEONE'S SHOES I'D LOVE TO FILL: Harrison Ford's. \nA RULE OF THUMB: What looks best to the camera is usually the most uncomfortable for you. In the Rockport poster, you just see these legs with boots, climbing up a wall.

When we reviewed Gregory's 10 years ago, it was new, and we found it good but inconsistent. Its few tables (seating a total of 45, including a few tables in the rear bar) and uneven performance made us suspect it would have a short life span.

The jacket, by Azzedine Alaia uses the ancient process of boiling wool cloth to cause shrinkage that results in a felted stiffness. The fabric can then be cut into jackets and coats without the usual inner structures or linings.   In the 1960's, a similar effect was achieved with double-faced wool, in which two pieces of cloth were stitched together to give the fabric a structure that defined the clothes then.

The city's streets teemed with people -- from lowlife and riffraff to cloaked royalty and aristocrats seeking anonymity in the crowds -- and in the finest democratic tradition, all took part in the life of the tabernas. (A 16th-century refrain quips: \"In Madrid, wild city/ that between the old and new/has 300 taverns/and not a single library.\") For centuries kings and their courts fled to the bustling taverns around the royal palace to escape the pressures of public life and to engage in romantic trysts. (It is said that Francisco de Goya was stabbed by a jealous husband in front of one tavern; Alfonso XIII was a well-known nocturnal prowler.) Taverns, in fact, did such good business that even convents and monasteries in Madrid began making wines and installing bars.\n\nBut it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that Madrid's tabernas reached their height, becoming uniquely Madrileno and acquiring a somewhat stylish veneer. Students found the inexpensive food, casual surroundings and convivial atmosphere to their liking. Affordable to all, tabernas dissolved class distinctions. Madrid's cultural elite, enthralled by the bohemian life of the tavern, gathered each evening for lively light conversation or intellectual debate, poetry readings, music and song.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Comptroller's Report Questions Benefits From Casino Gambling","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/nyregion/comptroller-s-report-questions-benefits-from-casino-gambling.html","abstract":"  In a report that strongly questions the benefits of casino gambling, New York State's Comptroller, H.

The Swedish company made one of the grandest of grand operas small: choosing voices of lyric quality, editing texts to provide focus and intimacy, eliminating the ballet and the crowds Verdi included to please Paris audiences. The Met, on the other hand, made the small large. Elijah Moshinsky's production dwarfed Shakespeare's handful of characters with oversize stage trappings. There were battlements lowered by a stage elevator, a bedroom dominated by columns suitable for the central office of a bank, and classical paintings the height of the stage.   These examples of Verdi grand and small might be the results of opposing artistic missions: the Swedish company strips away spectacle, the Met adds it. But the companies were also responding to opposing aspects of Verdi's work. (\"Don Carlos\" was first performed in 1867; \"Otello,\" in 1887, soon after Verdi produced a revised version of \"Don Carlos.\") The Met's grandeur emphasized the social and public themes in Verdi; the chamber-size Swedish production focused on interior, private preoccupations. The political and the personal strands coexist in both works; in fact, the tension between them is one of Verdi's recurrrent themes. The composer constantly juxtaposes the passions of private life with the demands of public life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"'Your Heart Goes Out to Them'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/nyregion/your-heart-goes-out-to-them.html","abstract":"  AMID the anxiety and anguish, the frustration and fear, Cheryl Simone and Alayna Jaenickazimer offered warm smiles and comfort to many who fled the Durham Woods apartment complex with little more than the nightclothes on their backs.

A four-inch pin in brass, pewter or silver, it depicts in diagrammatic form the hull of a slave ship and the arrangement of its tightly packed human cargo during the middle passage, the slaves' horrific voyage from Africa to the colonies. In one design, five cowrie shells (the number five is a symbol of justice in African lore) hang from the bottom of the pin. In the other, the facial images of five slaves hang from metal nooses.   WHO MAKES IT: A Bronx company, Who Deserves It More Than You? at 558 Grand Concourse, Box 1361, Bronx 10451; (718) 367-5233. The pin is the creation of Phyllis Bowdwin, a black jewelry designer who specializes in accessories for the African-American market. The pins sell for $75 (brass, with cowrie shells) and $120 (with slave images).   INSPIRATION FOR DESIGN: The pin commemorates 400 years of slavery and the deaths of millions of Africans in the slave trade. \"I decided to make the pin because I was disturbed that nothing had been done in terms of erecting a monument or permanent commemoration of the time of the middle passage,\" Ms. Bowdwin said.   HISTORY OF THE SHIP DIAGRAM: This image of the slave ship was first seen in \"The Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade by the British Parliament,\" a book by Thomas Clarkson that was published in 1808. The diagrams in the book depicted the ship from seven different angles, including a bird's-eye view of the top two decks and an intricate cutaway.    The image used for the pin, showing the teeming lower deck, is the most commonly reproduced. Dr. James Smalls, chairman of the African-American and Puerto Rican studies program at the City College of New York, said that almost all of the ships were designed basically the same way.   Ms. Bowdwin said, \"It is a classic image, a picture that was used over and over again, because it symbolized that whole period.\"    HOW THE PIN BECAME POPULAR: Ms. Bowdwin said she first introduced the pin in December at the Kwanzaa Holiday Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, where it was virtually overlooked. But she said that after one Expo shopper, a man, bought the cowrie-shell design, she began receiving orders, and she speculated that word-of-mouth helped create the demand. Since then, she said, she has sold more than 200 pins to buyers in the Northeast.   WHO WEARS IT: Dubaka Leigh, a computer graphics engineer at ABC, does. He said he bought it so he would not forget the legacy of slavery. It is a testament \"of the cruelty and barbarism of selling human beings as if they were beef and livestock,\" he said. The pin, he added, often ends up serving as a history lesson for most people.    REACTIONS: Ms. Bowdwin said some people want it and some are repulsed by it. \"Most people don't realize what it is at first,\" she said. \"The cowrie shells usually draw people to it.

In response, Hebron's Jewish settlers have established the Kingdom of Judea and Samaria, seceding from Israel and anointing as their King Yehudi HaGoel, formerly Jerry Goldberg of the Bronx. \n\nAs this excerpt begins, nearly a thousand settlers are gathered in their cluster of buildings in central Hebron that they call the Forefathers' Compound. Below the compound, in anticipation of a siege by the Israeli Army, they have secretly burrowed tunnels leading to underground living spaces adjoining the nearby burial site of the first Jews, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives. The site is called in the Bible, and known to Jews, as the Cave of Machpelah. Above the cave is the building known as the Tomb of the Patriarchs. \n\nAt his headquarters in the army base on a hilltop overlooking Hebron, General Uri Lapidot walked over to the window, took out his high-powered binoculars and trained them on the city of Hebron stretching out below, focusing on the Forefathers' Compound at its very heart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/books/c-correction-631531.html","abstract":"  A review on March 20 about \"Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy\" misattributed the illustrations.

But total prohibition of cigarettes, with no special provision for today's smokers, would create a black market larger than that for cocaine. A smart policy would separate current addicts from new users.\n\nSince almost every smoker picks up the habit during adolescence, the key to reducing smoking is to keep teen-agers from starting. Controls on advertising, a crackdown on sales to minors and designating more smoke-free areas can all help. Raising cigarette taxes would be even more effective, but this approach has its drawbacks if carried to extremes, as experience in Canada has shown. The Canadian tax of $5 a pack, introduced in the early 90's, reduced smoking among teen-agers, but it was a huge burden on low-income people addicted to cigarettes (a two-pack-a-day smoker carried a $3,500 annual habit). It also made drugstores the targets of tobacco robberies and spurred so much tax evasion -- eventually 80 percent of cigarettes smoked in Canada were smuggled -- that this year the Government had to cut the tariff to keep up tax revenues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Firepower and Ice: Lake Superior State Ambushes B.U.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/sports/ncaa-championship-firepower-and-ice-lake-superior-state-ambushes-bu.html","abstract":"  For a college hockey championship game, a 9-1 score is astonishing, like 100-50 in basketball or 73-0 in football.

May thine glories never fade   Or perish in an ambuscade!   Every spring about this time, I conclude that my place in baseball history is not yet secure. Few believe there was ever a time without an Opening Day, but there was such a time, and it was I who greased the sleeves of the club owners with \"Say, boys, wouldn't it be grand if every season began on the same day? Oh, what an adventure that would be!\"   \"Well, boys,\" the pooh-bahs exclaimed, \"does the lad have a point or not?\" The lad was 12, and did. The year, 1878.   We called our game base-ball back then, which seemed such a waste of space. That's another of my contributions. I still preserve a copy of my letter to the Scribes Association of 1875. \"Oh, you Scribes,\" I postulated, \"drop the hyphen and save the space!\" I signed it \"A NineYearOld With Ideas in His Bean.\" And that's what I was.   With my brother Neddy I spent many unsupervised hours tossing a Cognac bottle up against our barn. The game was to make our mother come bounding and leaping out. My, but she was widely held to be insane! Her appearances each counted as a run. Later, Neddy, who penned verse to toughen his fielding hand, dashed off these lines in her sainted honor: Mother, your apron is burning,   But I cannot put it out.   I'm miles away in a pasture,   Playing base-ball  [ sic ]  like a lout.   Mother, your leggings are burning,   They have a phosphoric smell.   But I'm running bases, Dear Heart,   They'll love your pies in Hell.    When it became too dark to continue our games, we would join our comrades of all ages in sitting around and yacking baseball, forever baseball, unless someone had plague blankets, and then we dared each other to sleep in them.   But soon it was back to baseball. I heard much wild talk of the tragedy of the Monitor and the Merrimac, and the number of lefty twirlers who gave their lives on those ships. At these times, in the closing dark, we felt a special sense of each other's destinies, but tastefully, we kept that kind of news to ourselves.   On one occasion, the superb Kid Gerty loomed at the center of our bunch. The chesty second sacker had been recently expelled from the Hartfords for muffing a superstition. \"Boys, I let a missionary parade about in my uniform. What harm could it do this once?\" he sobbed. \"I was dead wrong, and my mates were right to cast me out.\"   I asked Gerty did I have the stuff to be a true professional.   \"Oh, I couldn't say,\" he replied. \"It would crush you. No, I haven't a clue.\" This judgment much inflated my standing in town.   Truly, baseball of my day had seized the national imagination, so that made for trouble right there. I observed that there was entirely too much pretending going on. \"Play back, boys, I'm peerless Cappy Anson and he bats like this\" was a common fantasy of the fields. Or perhaps, \"See me, boys, I'm the barrel-chested O'Rourke twins. Say, watch how we feature the stick!\" Gosh, it was an epidemic.   To combat such carelessness, I became the Stance Authenticator, a service which, at 5 cents a player or a dollar a team, was a small price to pay for uniformity. What an inspiring sight it must have been to our women: hundreds of men and boys lined across a meadow, getting Cappy Anson's infernal hitch exactly right.   Inevitably, as my fame spread, I was visited by the Rule Book Committee of the Sporting Clubs -- Benny Songstreet, Senor Lou Cash, P. K. Thotny.    Senor Cash was humming It ain't no rupture, Roger   I'm a-stayin' in the Game.  Thotny asked, \"You the logical boy?\"    I conveyed that I was.   \"Gather round, boys,\" he whispered. \"We are in disarray. Disarray. Where is this season's logic when the Bostons have played all winter, all night, 50 or 60 games a week, salting away enough victories already -- 909 -- to cop the flag several times over? The Indianapoli, however, refuse to commence until their 'grand march' to the Grain Library is done. The Milwauks began yesterday, but the Chi Nine rooters have already accused them of letting gamblers take the field while players roam freely through the stands. Can you help us? Oh, a mumpy randomness is starting to spot the body of a noble racket!\"    \"Infatuated amateurs,\" I cried. \"Smug mice! You must decree one Opening Day and make the squads adhere or else. Then, expunge the records of this erstwhile silly season. The pleasures of monotony are ours for the taking! Oh, isn't this just the life?\"    What is it about those days and ways, why do they haunt me still, inning by inning, pitch by pitch, rolling ever onward like a baseball, endlessly stitched? I gave you the best I've gotten   I spent all the shells I've shotten   My tale is bereft   But it's all I got left   I'm afraid it adds up to notten.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Blazers Feel the Clinch As Nets Feel the Pinch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/sports/pro-basketball-blazers-feel-the-clinch-as-nets-feel-the-pinch.html","abstract":"  For the second straight game, Nets Coach Chuck Daly watched helplessly as his team, playing at home, had a playoff-bound club on the ropes only to go down to defeat.
