The question now is whether a Democratic Congress will vote its conscience or its fears. A no vote wouldn't bury the Clinton Presidency. But it would cast doubt on his and his party's ability to govern. It would also undermine Mr. Clinton's credibility abroad, just as the all-important Uruguay Round of international trade talks is drawing to a close.

Gilroy's bitterly nostalgic drama of family warfare, is by no means a source of comfort. Mother, who is played with monumental stoicism by the great Sada Thompson, knows everything, actually, since she is cursed with the power of clairvoyance. And judging by the pained, steely mask in which Ms. Thompson sets her face for much of her performance, her character has seen in her family's future, to borrow from a Gershwin song, \"more clouds of gray than any Russian play could guarantee.\"   \"Any Given Day,\" which is set in an oppressively formal, down-at-the-heels middle-class Bronx apartment in the early 1940's, most immediately evokes the corrosive family portraits that dominated American drama in the middle of this century. The play, at the Longacre Theater, also seems to be Mr. Gilroy's bid to write something like a Chekhovian tragicomedy of withering expectations. In it, he has created a host of regretful characters with puny hopes of escaping from a suffocating, ambition-thwarting domestic world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931117","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/nyregion/c-corrections-569893.html","abstract":"  The View column in the Westchester Weekly on Sunday misstated admission prices for the Westchester Cat Show next Saturday and Sunday at the County Center in White Plains, N.Y.

Unger recognizes the changing political sentiments in Taiwan regarding the island's international status. His call for Washington and Asian states to begin a diplomatic dialogue in preparation for an independent Taiwan is also laudable.   However, the statement that \"Taiwanese nationalists distinguish themselves from 'mainlanders' \" deserves clarification. The officially sanctioned line between \"Taiwanese\" and \"mainlanders\" has been steadily breaking down as a result of intermarriages and, more important, political liberalization. Being Taiwanese has almost exclusively been associated with the native (nonmainlander) population, but today \"mainlanders\" are increasingly calling themselves \"first- or second-generation Taiwanese,\" acknowledging their adopted home or birthplace.   A fairly young organization called Mainlander Association for Taiwanese Independence promotes not only its stated mission but also the peaceful coexistence of the island's diverse populations. In view of Taiwan's long and often turbulent immigration history, this development is to be welcomed. HENRY H.

The question was posed again -- with emphasis -- this week when the first reviews came in mixed, far short of what most Broadway watchers felt would be necessary to sustain it. And though overall the favorable notices have outnumbered the unfavorable ones, box-office sales this week, according to the producer, David G. Richenthal, have been on the order of $10,000 a day, nowhere near breaking even for a show whose weekly expenses are about $170,000, not including advertising. There is enough of an advance sale to keep the show on the boards through the first week in December.

Mario M. Cuomo's approval ratings continue to slide, according to an independent statewide poll released today. But the poll shows the Governor with a comfortable lead over the little-known Republicans who may challenge him in 1994.   Only 34 percent of the registered voters questioned by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion said they considered Mr. Cuomo's performance in office either excellent or good. That approval rating is the lowest registered by Marist in Mr. Cuomo's 11 years in office and is 6 percentage points lower than in the last Marist poll, taken in May. Half Say No 4th Term    Half of those surveyed said they did not want Mr. Cuomo to run for another four-year term, while 40 percent said he should seek re-election.

There are enough precedents in the last half-century to prove that no President knows how a Supreme Court justice will turn out once on the bench, surrounded by formidable colleagues and embraced by the aura of the past. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren and William J. Brennan Jr. to the United States Supreme Court -- two justices whose liberal decisions changed the country's laws and affected almost every American -- although he soon discovered they were not on his wavelength politically and regretted that he had ever chosen them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931119","headline":"The Evil Within Us All : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/opinion/IHT-the-evil-within-us-all-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Remembrance Is the Way To Live With That Hole\" (Opinion, Nov. 9) by Robert B.

Eshoo, a first-term Democrat from California, has been to the White House three times, dined at the Vice President's residence once and held dozens of conversations with members of the Cabinet. As she was leaving for Mexico on a fact-finding mission, President Clinton tracked her down by phone.   Representative Eshoo was on the receiving end of the White House strategy that amounted to a coordinated, computer-generated, all-hands-on-deck plan to pry votes loose for the North American Free Trade Agreement that consumed nearly all of the time of the President and his lieutenants for 56 critical days.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931119","headline":"A Trial by Fists, Then a Trial by Jury","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/sports/boxing-a-trial-by-fists-then-a-trial-by-jury.html","abstract":"  In boxing, where no outrage is too large -- witness a paraglider interrupting a heavyweight championship -- fans can pay to view a trial by fist tonight in the matter of Ray Mercer v.

The two boxers meet in the Convention Center in Atlantic City to try to revive moribund careers. But last Feb. 6, they battled in Madison Square Garden, in a bout in which Mercer had been promised a shot at the championship -- and a payday of at least $1.5 million -- if he won. He didn't. Worse, the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has charged that when things were going badly in the fight, Mercer began offering Ferguson a bribe of $100,000 to lose.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931119","headline":"Southeast Asia's Stake : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/opinion/IHT-southeast-asias-stake-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Seattle is both timely and important.

But however odd the coalition -- 132 Republicans and only 102 Democrats -- Mr. Clinton won a small economic and huge political victory in pushing Nafta through the House.    Nafta will open Mexico's borders to more U.S. exports and investment, a worthwhile achievement. More important, the Nafta win empowers Mr. Clinton to complete the more important Uruguay Round of international trade talks. And the vote tells Congress that the White House knows how to play tough, which should make health care and welfare reform a bit easier to achieve.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931119","headline":"1943: Berlin Is Hit Hard : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/opinion/IHT-1943-berlin-is-hit-hard-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] A strong force of Royal Air Force bombers tonight [Nov. 18] hit Berlin, according to the German news agency D.N.B. \"British bombers penetrated into northwest Germany and attacked Berlin with high explosives and i","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931119","headline":"Policy On Cubans Draws Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/sports/baseball-policy-on-cubans-draws-fire.html","abstract":"  With an increasing number of Cuban players defecting to the United States and other countries, major league baseball's position on their signing has commanded closer scrutiny and appears to be growing closer to being challenged.
