In folkloric concerts, the arrival of roots-conscious children is precisely the moment when sentimentality drives a stake through the heart of a show: one is expected to bemoan the loss of tradition and applaud the youths' valiant attempts to fight off encroaching international pop culture. But Ms. Mercury had other ideas. The three, beating out a complicated and ferocious samba pattern, were supported by a stadium rock production, including flashing lights, fog banks and a booming sound system. It was a pop spectacle, and it was authentic, and the crowd went haywire.   Ms. Mercury, a young singer from Bahia, packed the Ritz, and it was hard to imagine a better party anywhere. Men were holding women on their shoulders, and the entire audience was swaying to the music, singing along with the songs, or dancing. Ms. Mercury sings with a voice that can move easily from pure pop tones to a hoarse, African style. She and her two dancers worked tightly choreographed routines, and Ms. Mercury pretty much proclaimed herself to be sex on two feet, all in a nicely civilized, consensual adult way. She's a star: but in a domestic touch, her publicity biography mentions that she has two children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930428","headline":"Hartford Assembly Saves A 5Â¦ Deposit on Bottles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/28/nyregion/hartford-assembly-saves-a-5-deposit-on-bottles.html","abstract":"  Gov.

The play had its acclaimed New York premiere a year ago at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. The director for television (stage director Christopher Ashley seems to have become a nonperson in the publicity credits) is George C. Wolfe, who is represented on Broadway with \"Jelly's Last Jam\" and, in previews, \"Angels in America.\"   Tapping into a journalistic vein that in literature goes back at least as far as John Dos Passos, the television version of Ms. Smith's one-woman show allows her to embody 19 characters, male and female, black and white, young and old, all of them caught up in the Crown Heights tragedy that left two people dead. The dialogue is taken verbatim from interviews conducted by Ms. Smith and, for an Angela Davis segment, Thulani Davis. The acting sections are framed in black-and-white photographs of the real events, overlaid with music ranging from black hip-hop to traditional Jewish chants. The production is striking.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930428","headline":"Shoemaker Hopes for Rare Derby Double Feat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/28/sports/horse-racing-derby-notebook-shoemaker-hopes-for-rare-derby-double-feat.html","abstract":"  Bill Shoemaker rode 8,833 winners during his 41 years as a jockey, and four of them were winners of the Kentucky Derby.

These, coupled with gain-sharing bonuses, enable sanitation workers to earn greater annual income than police officers.   While you consider this methodology \"a strange way to calculate wages,\" economists, arbitrators and even city negotiators normally factor in the calculations used by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to determine total earnings.

He has also been known to contradict himself and produce a somewhat bewildering musical picture. A case in point was the Schubert Piano Sonata in B flat, played on the second half of his program Friday night. Mr. Zimerman had the technique and control for Schubert's easeful spans of sound, but the argument went awry at several crucial points.   At the outset of the first movement, for example, the main theme foundered amid unnecessary spells of rubato: the bass trill in the eighth bar, which should rumble beneath an even surface, failed to play its unsettling role. Then, later in the movement, Mr. Zimerman undercut major events with inexpressive articulation: the forte statement of the main theme did not roll in with the right leisurely grandeur (the tempo was slightly too fast throughout), and the momentous triple-piano re-entry of this same theme in the development slid past without a shiver of epiphany.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Measuring Warming","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/opinion/l-measuring-warming-043193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Vice President Gore may know more about global warming than the President (\"Mr. Clinton, Meet Mr. Gore,\" editorial, April 20), but the whole Administration should be aware of what is known.

The assault by television experts has subsided, and for the moment it seems safe to tune in your favorite interview shows. But watch your head; this is likely to be just a Serbian truce.   After the invasion of experts on terrorism set off by the bombing of the World Trade Center, there was only a brief respite before the little war in Waco, Tex., called forth a swarm of experts on cultism. These cadres, swooping straight from producers' Rolodexes onto the nation's screens, were in a thriving television tradition of know-it-alls expatiating at the summons of the evening news on why a catastrophe they never predicted could now easily be foreseen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Review/Theater; Trying to Grasp an AIDS Tragedy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/theater/review-theater-trying-to-grasp-an-aids-tragedy.html","abstract":"  Lee Blessing's \"Patient A\" is a playwright's conversation with himself about the difficulties of understanding a real-life tragedy and distilling it into dramatic form. The case is that of Kimberly Bergalis, the young woman in Florida who became infected with AIDS after being treated by her dentist. For a time, the play seems like a delaying mechanism to avoid telling the story.   As portrayed by Jon DeVries, Mr. Blessing is himself a character onstage. Acting as narrator and editor, he repeatedly interrupts Ms. Bergalis (Robin Morse), tossing in poems, statistics and observations. Just at the point that we become annoyed with his interference in the narrative, he apologizes for that interference. Despite all these distractions, \"Patient A\" moves a theatergoer to feelings of sympathy and admiration for Kimberly, and outrage at all those who took advantage of her.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Essay; Bosnia Speech Draft","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/opinion/essay-bosnia-speech-draft.html","abstract":"    Team A is drafting the President's speech on the need to intervene in Bosnia.

On Thursday night, the New York Philharmonic extended no such courtesy to Phillip Ramey, giving his Concerto for Horn and Strings a run-through rather than a performance. The strings repeatedly smudged entries and produced a dull, anemic sound. Philip Myers made his way through the solo part with much effort and little grace. Leonard Slatkin appeared to be doing his best on the podium, but the orchestra palpably had no enthusiasm for the music.   In the Philharmonic's defense, it must be said that the Ramey concerto, a leisurely, mildly dissonant work in two movements, was not the most distinctive of this season's 150th-anniversary commissions. The decision to expose a solo horn line without full orchestral support was risky, to begin with; Mr. Ramey's episodic string sonorities supplied an unfocused background. The first movement initiated an atmosphere of expectation that later events failed to answer. The basic melodic material was not arresting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-93280648178.html","abstract":"Seeking the Reason Why .

Mr. Khvorostovsky's voice, recorded on the Philips label and heard in Carnegie Hall on Monday night, can also provide such pleasure to others: the sound, across its range, is topped by a ringing overtone. The voice can even create, in its lower range, the illusion of being far bigger than it really is; it carries well. Add to this an imposing physical presence and a fervent delivery, and it is easy enough to see why this young singer, born in 1962, has made such a strong impression since he first came to world attention in 1989 as the winner of BBC's Cardiff Singer of the World competition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Cruel and Now Forgotten, Like an Unmarked Grave","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/opinion/IHT-cruel-and-now-forgotten-like-an-unmarked-grave.html","abstract":"- General George S.
