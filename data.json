Under Charles Dutoit, the Montreal has become an elegant conveyance. When one listens carefully, individual winds and brass lack that extra sheen of glamour. But the strings, breathing easily together, give off a soft shine that is quite remarkable. Orchestras are usually the means for symphonic music, the enablers of ideas. Here, orchestra technique influenced, if not dictated, how the music would speak.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941018","headline":"South China Sea:Washington Needs to Hear About Beijing's Claims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/opinion/IHT-south-china-seawashington-needs-to-hear-about-beijings-claims.html","abstract":"U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, now in China, should have one question at the top of his Beijing agenda: What are China's claims regarding the South China Sea?

Paul (Francois Cluzet) owns a hotel by a serene lake. He marries the beautiful Nelly (Emmanuelle Beart), they have a son, and soon Paul begins hearing voices in his head that tell him Nelly is unfaithful. \"L'Enfer\" (\"Hell\") works best in its early stages, when it is clear that Paul is losing his mind but unclear just what Nelly might be up to.

As an artist, he has been remarkably deep and original.   At the same time, his work, with its dramatic reading of 20th-century music (especially by Stravinsky and the composers of Mr. Kylian's native Czechoslovakia) heralded a dance expressionism in the 1970's that stood out against the formal experiments of the time.

Mario Cuomo's proposed takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company is clearly an election-year ploy. Three weeks before elections, he says the takeover would yield a 10 percent cut in electricity bills for Long Island voters. But whatever the Governor's motive, his proposal warrants serious attention. Indeed, with additional safeguards the plan could yield sizable benefits to Lilco shareholders and customers.   At the core of the plan is a tax dodge. If the state were to buy Lilco from its shareholders, the utility would no longer owe Federal taxes and could borrow at tax-free -- therefore low -- interest rates. Lilco could use the low-cost loans to buy back shares, thereby eliminating dividends, and to replace existing high-cost loans. The potential saving is huge because Lilco is buried in debt, in part because it built a $5.5 billion nuclear plant, Shoreham, which it never opened in the face of ferocious opposition from nearby residents and, well, Governor Cuomo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941020","headline":"Discipline Meets Show Biz, Amicably","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/arts/dance-review-discipline-meets-show-biz-amicably.html","abstract":"  One of the most popular dance groups on the national circuit, surprisingly, did not make its Manhattan debut until Tuesday night.

Mr. Martini's Commercial    PRODUCER -- Dave Murray Associates, Princeton, N.J.    ON THE SCREEN -- The 30-second ad first features pictures of Mr. Klein, former Gov. Jim Florio and President Clinton; beneath them are the words \"The Tax and Spend Way.\" Meanwhile, an announcer says: \"It's clear their way isn't working anymore. Bill Martini can do better.\" The next scene is that of a fund-raiser attended by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Sheriff Edwin Englehardt of Passaic County, one of the party's most popular local figures; under Mrs. Whitman's picture are the words \"Martini will cut taxes.\" And the Governor is heard saying, \"We need Bill Martini in Congress to cut spending, to cut taxes, to end politics as usual.\"   ANALYSIS -- The familiar \"tax and spend\" label that Republicans use against Democratic opponents has become such a campaign cliche that it defies examination. The unspoken message: guilt by association. Mr. Klein's Commercial   PRODUCER -- Fenn, King, Murphy Communications, Washington.   ON THE AIR -- The 60-second ad features an announcer who sounds like a carnival pitchman saying, \"Stand up, Bill, you won the doozy for talking about cutting spending in Congress even though you, Bill Martini, know how to waste money better than anyone in New Jersey. You voted to approve $23 million in cost overruns on the county administration building. Originally budgeted at $15 million, now it will cost taxpayers over $100 million, including interest. Now that's a doozy. And that's why you, Bill Martini, are the winner of the lifetime doozy award.\"   ANALYSIS -- The \"doozy ad\" is an effort to throw the \"tax and spend\" charge right back at Mr. Martini.   But Mr. Martini wasn't even on the Passaic County Board of Freeholders when the project was first discussed in 1988, or when it was designed or put out to bid.    \"In fact, when I joined the board in January 1993, the building was already 85 percent completed,\" he said.    And despite the fact that the site had some unexpected environmental problems that contributed to its final $38 million cost, the entire project's overrun was less than 4 percent, he said.   Mr. Klein, of course, is gambling that even if voters hear both sides of the story, what they will remember when they get in the voting booth is something about Mr. Martini and a project that ended up costing millions.

The instructions probably aren't necessary, since the witch is talking to a living metaphor. The little girl, Pearl, is played by an indisputably adult actress (Erin Cressida Wilson) in a sexy crimson gown that keeps falling off her shoulders.   There's no doubt that this Pearl is a walking reminder of the moment of illicit carnality in which she was conceived. That was also pretty clear in the novel that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's masterpiece. But in Ms. Nagy's interpretation, which has been staged by the hot young director Lisa Peterson, symbols, subtext and contemporary correspondences are scaled up in a way that calls nudging attention to form as well as content. And later when Pearl, in talking about her penchant for collecting decaying flora and fauna, announces, \"I'm fond of decomposition,\" she might as well be speaking for the author.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941020","headline":"Davies and Nicholas Use Power and Finesse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/sports/golf-davies-and-nicholas-use-power-and-finesse.html","abstract":"  They are the Mutt and Jeff of European women's golf, the long and short of it, a par 5 and a par 3.

These days it's more a pedestrian question of survival, of trying to at least simulate some of that early exuberance. It's not happening.    Reasons are not hard to come by. Veteran staff members are now in their 40's and not always in tune with their younger writers. The performers are interested less in a long run on the show than in snagging a lucrative movie or sitcom deal elsewhere.  The show's longtime producer, James Downey, says he sadly detects \"a more measured kind of involvement.\" That extends even to Lorne Michaels, the executive producer, who left the show from 1980 to 1985 and who now copes with a schedule that includes feature films and \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941020","headline":"Harassment in Singapore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/opinion/harassment-in-singapore.html","abstract":"  Many Americans applauded Singapore's brutal caning of the teen-ager Michael Fay earlier this year.
