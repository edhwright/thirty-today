The dollar differences are not great; they could be resolved in a minute. Indeed, the city would be better served if they were, so all concerned could turn to the truly enormous budget problems they face in the new year, not a month away.    The current fight is over the Mayor's proposed cuts in the $31.6 billion budget adopted in June for the fiscal year that began July 1. City revenue has fallen short of what was then expected, so the Mayor -- as required by law -- has proposed spending cuts to match the loss of revenue. The Council disagrees with a small portion of his cuts and has proposed alternative cuts, provoking a legal fight over who has the final say.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941208","headline":"New York's Plan for Sex-Shop Zoning Fails Constitutional Test","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/opinion/l-new-york-s-plan-for-sex-shop-zoning-fails-constitutional-test-049530.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"High Court Backs Cities' Zoning of Sex Shops\" (letter, Nov. 30): Prof. M.

The boards have a signature look -- jet black, with a silver S Ski graphic at the tip. Elan and Kneissel make a similar ski shape. Available in two models, the S ski costs $475. To order from S Ski, you can telephone (303) 925-9600 or fax (303) 920-7713. In New York, you can call Scandinavian Ski Shop at (212) 757-8524. Boots    Rather than buying new boots, there is a way now to revitalize the old ones. Raichle Molitar, the Swiss ski equipment manufacturer, has developed moldable liners that fit into most any plastic boot shell. A customized fit is achieved by heating the liners, called Thermoplastic innerboots, as part of the molding process. The liner cools in the shape of the skier's foot, from toe to heel and to the top of the boot. The company has set up convection ovens at ski shops for heating the liners. Available this season in five models, including an innerboot for hard-shell snowboarding boots, the Thermoplastic liners range from $129 to $169. For a dealer location, the number is (800) ANY-FOOT. Goggles    Short of growing a two-day beard, any skier these days can take on the Alberto Tomba look. The Italian ski racer's goggle is now available to consumers through Briko Racing, of Port Washington, L.I. Aptly named the Racing Detector VIP, the Briko goggle comes with a V.I.P. price of $300. Briko also has introduced a less racy model called the Racing Detector, at $100. Both goggles are designed with a 180-degree visual sweep and include Briko's Thrama lens, designed to cut through the flat light that so often turns ski slopes into moonscapes. Both models of goggle are edged in thick foam to absorb shock if a skier falls. The VIP version is made with an outer frame of aluminum, while the regular goggle comes with a hard plastic frame. For a dealer location, the number is (800) GO-BRIKO. Map Holders    Anyone who has tried to use a map to locate trails on an unfamiliar mountain knows the hassle. There are ski poles to put aside, gloves to take on and off, pockets to dig into, jackets to adjust, and chairlifts to hang onto. All the while, the map is flapping in the breeze like a kite on a string. The Launch Corporation of Denver has come to the rescue this year with the Skiersleeve, a plastic see-through vinyl pouch to hold trail maps. The sleeve, made with a black foam backing, wraps around a skier's forearm with Velcro. Once tucked inside, the trail guide is protected from sleet and snow and is easily seen. It is available for $15 at some ski shops nationwide or by ordering directly through Skiersleeve at (800) 322-2930. Ski Racks    Getting to the slopes brings up another need: roof racks. This year, Masco Tech Inc., the automobile equipment manufacturer from Taylor, Mich., has got in on the act. The company, which has traditionally installed the luggage racks that come standard with most vans and sport utility vehicles, is selling roof rack adaptors directly to consumers. Its Append Sport Rack line includes the new Top Wing Ski and Snowboard Carrier, which sells for about $95 at ski shops. The adaptor is made to carry skis on cars or vans that already have a factory-installed roof rack. The carrier comes with brackets that snap onto the standardized rails and cross bars. For a dealer, or to order directly, the number is (800) 4-APPEND.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941208","headline":"Arafat Tells Christopher He'll Act Against Terrorism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/world/arafat-tells-christopher-he-ll-act-against-terrorism.html","abstract":"  Yasir Arafat said the words he was supposed to say today.

Both Miss Lapzeson and Miss Berger have a strong theatrical presence: projection rather than choreographic invention colored their pieces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941208","headline":"Sports of The Times: Baseball; Brissie Never Thought of Failure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/sports/sports-of-the-times-baseball-brissie-never-thought-of-failure.html","abstract":"YESTERDAY, Dec. 7, the 50th anniversary of the day that changed his life and contributed in a harrowing way to making him one of the most remarkable figures in American sports history, Lou Brissie did nothing different to mark it. No reason to.   He woke beside his wife in their home in North Augusta, S.C., felt the ache in his left leg that has never left him for a single day over this half-century and prepared for work as a state supervisor of job trainees. - \"Sometimes, when people know that I had pitched in the major leagues, and see I have some trouble gettin' around, they ask if I injured my knee playin' ball,\" he said yesterday by telephone. \"I tell 'em, 'Well, no, it was a little something I got in the service, and that's it.' \"   Brissie, now 70 years old, his hair thinning, still big at 6 feet 4 1/2 inches and still looking fit, can walk unaided, though with a slight limp, for short distances. Otherwise, he must rely on a cane or crutches.   And he remembers: It was on Dec. 7, 1944, in the Apennines in central Italy as American soldiers moved up against German positions, that an advance echelon, with the 20-year-old Corporal Brissie, got into trouble.   \"They unloaded everything on us,\" he recalled. \"The shell that hit me killed 11 men. I was the closest when it exploded, but I got mine mostly in the legs. The others were hit mostly in the throat and the head.\"   Brissie crawled to a creek, where he hoped to get some protection, and passed out. He was left for dead until one medic carried him off. In the Army hospital in Naples, a doctor said he must amputate his left leg.   \"Doc, you can't!\" said Brissie. \"I'm a ballplayer. You have to try to find another way.\"   Before entering the military, Brissie had been a promising left-handed high school and then freshman college pitcher at Presbyterian in South Carolina. Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia A's, wrote him while he was in service and promised him a tryout on his return.   The army surgeon, Dr. William Brubaker, who would become a lifelong friend of Brissie's, found a way to save the leg. Brissie was the first person in the Mediterranean theater to be given the new drug penicillin, and Brissie underwent surgery -- the first of 23 operations on his leg -- in which 30 bone fragments and 5 1/2 inches of skin bone were removed.   Now began an amazing story, beginning with his return on a stretcher to America to his wife and infant daughter, seeking to regain his health and use of his leg in veterans hospitals and never forgetting his dream of pitching in the big leagues, though often being told by doctors: \"You must understand your limitations, young man. Think about other things you can do.\"   Brissie began throwing a baseball on crutches. He was soon free of them. He hooked up with a sandlot team in 1946, wore a bulky aluminum brace that was made to protect his leg but drew stares, went through tearful disappointments, then adjusted his pitching stride and learned how to field bunts. He joined the Savannah Class AA ball club and began winning games. In 1947, he was called up to the A's. \"It took my breath away,\" he recalled.   On opening day of 1948, he started against the Red Sox. In the sixth inning, Ted Williams hit a line drive off his leg brace. It made a clanging noise heard throughout the ball park. Brissie collapsed. Williams ran from first base to the mound. \"Are you all right?\" he asked. Brissie looked up from the ground. \"Why don't you pull the damn ball?\" he said. They both laughed.   Brissie, despite battling infections and pain, became a standout pitcher, making the American League All-Star team in 1949. He was traded to Cleveland in 1951 and retired from baseball two years later, refusing to be sent back to the minor leagues.   \"I knew I was a symbol to many veterans trying to overcome problems,\" he said. \"I wasn't going to let them down.\"   Today, Brissie says he identifies in a manner with Jim Abbott, the Yankees' one-handed pitcher. \"He was innovative, and it seemed, like me, he never thought of failing.\" Brissie is also distressed about the baseball strike. \"There's not going to be a winner. That's the tragedy.\"   Last summer, for the first time in nearly 50 years, Lou Brissie returned to Italy, visiting military cemeteries at Anzio and other sites.   \"I found a lot of old friends there, and thought about those times,\" he said. He paused for a moment. \"I didn't handle it as well as I thought I would.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941208","headline":"Orange County Crisis Shakes Bond Market","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/us/orange-county-crisis-shakes-bond-market.html","abstract":"  The sudden plunge of Orange County, Calif., into bankruptcy shook the municipal bond market, threatening to make it more expensive for many local governments to borrow.

They are taxpayers, too, which means that apart from providing a welcome service, they are helping pay the city's bills.   Food peddlers can create congestion, however, which is why this mini-industry needs regulating. The 1983 law that prohibited food vending on more than 100 streets was rarely enforced until Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pressed the police last spring to do so. If the crackdown thrilled restaurant owners, it infuriated the vendors and every New Yorker accustomed to picking up a cheap, al fresco lunch. Furthermore, though selling food from a cart may sound entrepreneurial, nearly half the permits had been gobbled up by companies. One owner has 499 of the 2,811 permits now outstanding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941209","headline":"25,000 U.S. TROOPS TO AID U.N.

Mr. Glass calls his piece \"an opera for ensemble and film,\" but it is not quite an opera, since one never wants to look at the singers or pay any attention to their superfluous gestures and expressions. But this work is also much more than a film score, because the music is never merely subliminal.    In fact, the music demands equal attention with Jean Cocteau's classic film, which is stripped of its soundtrack and projected on a screen behind the seven players of the Philip Glass Ensemble and the four singers. The soloists sing precisely the same words the original actors spoke, but the lip-synching never quite works and it never quite matters. Individual words simply do not make that much difference in this score. Mr. Glass's interest is not in word painting but in creating atmosphere in his familiar style, with waves of harmonies, repeated arpeggios and sequences of scales. The music even at times eclipses the film.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941209","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/09/arts/art-in-review-060259.html","abstract":"  Cheri Samba    Annina Nosei   100 Prince Street   SoHo   Through Wednesday","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941209","headline":"Choosing the Soft Life Over the Good Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/09/sports/on-pro-basketball-choosing-the-soft-life-over-the-good-life.html","abstract":"  Danny Manning couldn't imagine spending the rest of his professional basketball life in a beat-up joint known as the Los Angeles Sports Arena.

Mr. Gingrich misrepresents the law to promote his agenda -- a prayer amendment to the Constitution. He cites the dubious case of Raymond Raines, a pupil in St. Louis allegedly disciplined for praying over his cafeteria lunch.

Surrounded by supportive buddies, the officers expressed relief that their families might live normal lives again, and they gleefully teased each other about their muscles and love lives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941210","headline":"Pentagon to Cut $7.7 Billion in New Weapons Programs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/10/us/pentagon-to-cut-7.7-billion-in-new-weapons-programs.html","abstract":"  The Pentagon announced today that it would cut $7.7 billion in new weapons programs over the next six years to help combat readiness by paying for increased salaries and improved living conditions for American troops.

She had lost so much: her job as a vice president at Wells Fargo, her house in one of the pretty communities near San Francisco, her salary, her savings. Her freedom.     Little by little, she had begun to suspect that her daughter was being molested. Other people saw the signs, but the authorities were unconvinced. Finally, she took the girl and ran to France. And when they were found the child went to live with the man Paula believed was a pedophile: her daughter's father, who denies the allegations. So in the end she lost her daughter, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941210","headline":"Health Dept. Criticizes E.M.S.

(AP) TENNIS Off Night: Agassi Loses Temper, Match  Magnus Larsson of Sweden and Todd Martin of the United States won quarterfinal matches in the Compaq Grand Slam Cup in Munich, Germany, yesterday, with Larsson beating Andre Agassi, who came close to being disqualified from the $6 million tournament for swearing. Larsson won, 6-3, 1-6, 6-0, and Martin beat Sergi Bruguera, the French Open champion, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).   Agassi received a warning and was penalized a point when he repeated the obscenity, giving Larsson a break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. On the next point, Agassi whacked a return that nearly knocked down the microphone of Umpire Mike Morrisey of Britain. \"That was very unfortunate, wasn't it?\" Agassi said.   Larsson said he never heard what Agassi said. \"But obviously he said it, and the umpire heard it,\" he said. \"If he gets a warning that easy and the point penalty that easy and then he hits the ball at the umpire, of course, he should be defaulted. But it didn't matter to me. I was just glad to win the game.\" Agassi said there were too many microphones on tennis courts, put there to enhance coverage.

Nicklaus came up with the winning shot. He hit his second shot, an 8-iron, out of a difficult hillside lie 146 yards from the green, within 20 feet of the pin on the first playoff hole. After both Tom Weiskopf and Simon Hobday missed their chances at par on the par-4 hole, they conceded the hole and the match to Nicklaus and Palmer.

Common ingredients create this paradigm for success, among them relative isolation, a loyal, longtime conductor and an abiding sense of place. There is an export trade involved, with busy self-promotion, tours and recordings. But in these more modest institutions, the effort to survive begins at home, with service to one's constituency.   Britain offers one example. The City of Birmingham Orchestra, with only average talent, has used the salesmanship and ingenuity of Simon Rattle to create a photogenic oasis in the midst of urban industrial grimness. In quite another venue, the Oslo Philharmonic, which played two concerts at Carnegie Hall this week, provides a stimulating antidote to a city's smothering Old World charm. In the process, both groups have proved that the worth of an orchestra can be greater than the sum of its assets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941210","headline":"Giza Journal; Now Even the Sphinx Might Protest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/10/world/giza-journal-now-even-the-sphinx-might-protest.html","abstract":"  The great limestone figure of the Sphinx, its nose on display in the British Museum and its shanks eroded by wind and sand, has suffered many indignities over the last 4,000 years.
