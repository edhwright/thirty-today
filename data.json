Mr. Kerrey is right that entitlements, programs like Social Security and Medicare for which spending is driven by formula rather than annual decisions by Congress, pose a huge budget problem. They, along with interest payments, are expected to account for over 70 percent of Federal spending by the year 2003, leaving crumbs for everything else.

By whatever name, all 24 were played by the pianist Vladimir Feltsman at the 92d Street Y on Sunday afternoon.   The point would be niggling were it not for the noticeable differences between Bach's first and second efforts.

In this 1945 work, which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Monday evening after an 11-year absence, certainties are few and ambiguities abound. That puts it in sharp contrast to most of the Met's fare, operas in which heroes are heroes and villains are villains. Given the straightforward simplicity of Tyrone Guthrie's 1967 production and a strong cast that comes to the music with original, if sometimes debatable, interpretive ideas, this \"Grimes\" makes an unusually provocative evening of theater.   Mainly, it keeps one guessing about Britten's intentions. Grimes, a gruff Suffolk fisherman whose young apprentices are prone to fatal accidents, stands defiantly apart from a hypocritical, oppressive society. Britten identified strongly with that, and there is a degree to which Grimes is shown as that quintessential 19th-century loner-hero, the misunderstood artist. \"I can see the shoals to which the rest are blind,\" Grimes declares, striking the classic pose of the Romantic artist glimpsing truths beyond mortal vision.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"The Pop Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/arts/the-pop-life-105074.html","abstract":"  Down Time for Etheridge    Melissa Etheridge has been on the road for a year and a half without a break.

That program raised the question, echoed tonight, of whether the efforts to save Mr. Otey were a tribute to America's justice system or a waste of time and resources.   In 1978, Mr. Otey was convicted of the murder of a 26-year-old Nebraska woman, largely on the basis of his graphic description of how he had stabbed and smothered her and then hit her a few times with a hammer just to be sure she was dead. Later he said the confession had been coerced, but his volunteer lawyer, who is at the center of tonight's account, does not take that tack. Granting that his client might have done the deed, Victor Covalt argues that Mr. Otey should live because in his years on death row he studied philosophy and wrote poetry and was now a different man from the one who murdered Jane McManus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"In TV Age, Fifth Graders Fall in Love With the Written Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/nyregion/in-tv-age-fifth-graders-fall-in-love-with-the-written-word.html","abstract":"  Something extraordinary happens every day in Kathleen Tolan's fifth-grade classroom at Public School 125, the Ralph J.

By the T.V.A.'s reckoning, these were the last nuclear units still under construction in the nation. The T.V.A. once had the most ambitious nuclear program in the country, with 17 reactors on order. But as it turned out, the agency built only five nuclear units, of which only three are currently operating.   The reasons for the latest abandonment are the same that curtailed other nuclear construction around the country -- ballooning costs and uncertainty about when plants could finally be brought on line. Although the T.V.A. had already spent $6.3 billion on the units and they were from 57 percent to 88 percent completed, the authority estimated it could cost up to $8.8 billion more to finish the job. That was simply too much when it already felt overburdened with debt, some 44 percent of which had been spent on its nuclear program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941215","headline":"Journal; The Key to the City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/opinion/journal-the-key-to-the-city.html","abstract":"  On New Year's Eve, thousands of revelers, tourists and scoundrels will once again gather in Times Square to watch the ball drop, and millions more will watch on TV.
