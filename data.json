Bantam Books. $22.95.     Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third President of the United States, presents the historical novelist with several problems. To begin with, the historical record concerning Jefferson is enormous, as the bulk of Jefferson's own eloquent writings and Dumas Malone's minutely detailed six-volume biography attests. Jefferson's life does not provide a lot of room for novelistic improvisation.   Furthermore, the highly rational, practical-minded Jefferson does not immediately present the novelist with a particularly colorful or emotionally sympathetic canvas. While no one would contest Jefferson's role as a pivotal figure in the history of American democracy, he is not a historical personage with the personal bravura of an Aaron Burr or a Huey Long. This, after all, was a man who counted every penny he spent and filled volumes of journals with notes on the weather.   His hagiographers have depicted him as a man of perfect marble, swearing, in one historian's words, \"eternal hostility to every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" His detractors have portrayed him as a hypocrite: an abolitionist who owned slaves, an egalitarian who believed in racism, a libertarian who often failed to defend civil liberties.   Max Byrd, a scholar specializing in 18th-century literature and the author of five suspense novels, has focused on another contradiction in Jefferson's life -- his inability to reconcile the promptings of his head and his heart -- and has used this contradiction as a springboard for a wonderfully vivid novel that brings the sage of Monticello (or a version of him, anyway) to life.   Mr. Byrd is not interested here in using Jefferson as a vehicle for reinterpreting a pivotal era in America history; he is interested in Jefferson as a personality, as a highly gifted and conflicted individual who happened to play a formative role in the founding of this country. His Jefferson is an elusive, mercurial fellow: a romantic who conceals his emotional vulnerabilities behind a mask of cordiality; a lonely widower, who is ill at ease in the public world of banquets and speeches; a doting father who refuses to accord his daughters the freedom he promotes for the masses, and a chilly moralist and master of self-control who finds himself unexpectedly falling in love.   Borrowing a device from Gore Vidal's \"Burr,\" Mr. Byrd allows the reader to see his protagonist through the eyes of a young man who works in Jefferson's office. In this case, the young man is based on a real person named William Short, one of Jefferson's proteges, who served as his secretary during his years as American envoy to France. A callow, impulsive young man, Mr. Byrd's Short is almost hopelessly in awe of Jefferson; he hopes to play Boswell to Jefferson's Johnson.   \"He would sift, examine, develop,\" Mr. Byrd writes of Short. \"Penetrate Jefferson's defenses, disclose the springs of his character: explain once and for all why he guarded his feelings so closely; why his feelings were all the stronger for being walled in and guarded.\"   Although the fictional Short's memoirs cut back and forth in time to sketch in Jefferson's youth and the years of the American Revolution, they concentrate on Jefferson's tenure in France (1784-89), a period that recently drew considerable attention in a biography by Willard Sterne Randall, who argued that the sophistications of Paris effectively helped to transform Jefferson's world view. This is also the period when Jefferson is believed, by some writers, to have seduced a mulatto housemaid named Sally Hemmings.   Skating nimbly around the Hemmings controversy, Mr. Byrd's Short instead focuses his attention on Jefferson's romantic attachment to Maria Cosway, a painter married to a successful British artist. It appears to have been love at first sight. We see Jefferson behaving like a besotted schoolboy in front of the lovely Maria: he even breaks his wrist, attempting to impress her by leaping over a fence.   The affair quickly blossoms, and then just as rapidly dissolves. Why has their love failed to take root? Short speculates that \"Maria was far too flirtatious and independent\" and Jefferson \"liked women who were submissive, feminine, yielding.\" Also, Short thinks, Jefferson's daughter Patsy hated Maria, and \"Jefferson's ties to Patsy were the unshakable Virginia ones of blood.\"   Here and there in this volume, Short engages in Freudian speculation about Jefferson's life. He suggests that Jefferson disliked his mother, and that this early, sour relationship colored his subsequent romances with women. He suggests that the early death of Jefferson's father left him in need of a father figure, and that George Washington filled the bill. And he suggests that the many losses Jefferson suffered in his life (the deaths of his parents, coupled with the untimely deaths of his wife and several of their children) caused him to erect elaborate emotional fences.   By placing this speculation in the mouth of the fictionalized Mr. Short, Mr. Byrd is able to sidestep questions concerning the veracity of such musings. In an author's note, he tells the reader that he has made a few minor changes in the historical record (mainly involving dates), but has otherwise adhered \"to the generally agreed-upon facts\" as he found them in the real William Short's papers, and contemporaries' papers, including the vast annotated edition of Jefferson's own writings.   So authoritatively does Mr. Byrd conjure up the day-to-day details of Jefferson's life, so knowingly does he describe the atmosphere of prerevolutionary France that the reader practically forgets that his novel is based on thousands and thousands of researched facts. Indeed, \"Jefferson\" has the organic intimacy of a novel that has sprung full-blown from the imagination of its creator.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931123","headline":"Starks!

What the museum offered, in the form of lectures on Segovia's life, working methods, achievements and instruments, ending with a recital by Manuel Barrueco, was the kind of examination regularly lavished on composers and hardly ever on performers.    Performers, after all, stand a rung or two lower than composers on the evolutionary ladder. Composers create; performers are their henchmen. And besides, performers reap their rewards -- adulation, high fees -- in this world. Composers are rewarded posthumously, with such benefits as daylong seminars. But there are reasons Segovia's work warrants examination. Although the Spanish guitar had both virtuosos and enthusiasts long before he made his public debut in 1909, it was Segovia's evangelical zeal that brought the instrument into the mainstream of concert life. And although his own compositions were few and inconsequential, he goaded hundreds of composers into writing for his instrument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931123","headline":"A Seeker of Mystery Takes Stock of Suburbs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/23/nyregion/our-towns-a-seeker-of-mystery-takes-stock-of-suburbs.html","abstract":"  IT was a dark and stormy night.

No one can safely predict that the digital book will replace the printed book in the third millennium, but that is where the seemingly smart money is today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931123","headline":"New York Urged to Shift Cost of Fighting Shore Erosion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/23/nyregion/new-york-urged-to-shift-cost-of-fighting-shore-erosion.html","abstract":"  People who live near the shore would pay more in taxes and fees to help protect New York's coastline from storm damage under a plan released today by a state task force.

A Dinosaur's Story\" is a brief, witty children's book about dinosaurs who pay a visit to New York City, a place that is described amusingly from the dinosaurs' point of view. But tiny admirers of Hudson Talbott's illustrated volume will be surprised to find the dinosaurs in the animated screen version, \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story,\" play second fiddle to a cast of people. The people are brash, rude and occasionally scary. This was somebody's idea of how to enhance the authentic New York City atmosphere.   That somebody is apparently John Patrick Shanley, whose screenplay creates a wise-talking little boy named Louie as the story's human hero. Louie is the kind of confident lad who addresses dinosaurs as \"you morons\" when he first sees them, although of course he comes to love them deeply only moments later. (The film is also shamelessly sentimental.) Accompanying Louie is a lonely rich girl named Cecilia, whom he addresses as \"Babe\" at one point and kisses amorously in the film's finale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931124","headline":"Driver's Shot From the Point Earns a Point for the Devils","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/sports/baseball-driver-s-shot-from-the-point-earns-a-point-for-the-devils.html","abstract":"  Devils 1, Nordiques 1   Two of the National Hockey League's best young goaltenders got to shine last night in Quebec before fans from their hometown area.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931124","headline":"Skating By -- at 72 M.P.H.; Some Lovers of Rollerblading Are Speeding Up the Sport by Latching Onto Autos","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/nyregion/skating-72-mph-some-lovers-rollerblading-are-speeding-up-sport-latching-onto.html","abstract":"  Tom Rooney, an investment banker for Prudential Securities, was riding in a limousine uptown on Third Avenue for cocktails at Mortimer's the other night.

At a meeting at the White House today with President Clinton, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea expressed some reluctance to go along with an earlier American proposal to offer the North a suspension of an annual American-South Korean military training exercise, called \"Team Spirit,\" saying he felt that this might make him look too eager to meet one of the North's principal demands.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931124","headline":"God Saves Queen, but Not England Coach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/sports/sports-people-soccer-god-saves-queen-but-not-england-coach.html","abstract":"  GRAHAM TAYLOR quit as manager of England's national team yesterday, six days after his team was eliminated from the World Cup.

The movie's biggest challenge, one that it does not exactly meet, is to persuade the audience that this husband and father's escapade is somehow an act of love.    Fortunately, Robin Williams lurks behind that latex face mask, ready to scatter wicked jokes and brilliant non sequiturs about whatever crosses his mind. Mr. Williams's genius is in these details, and it is given free rein during much of \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" as in the sequence that has him improvising with toy dinosaurs at a television studio and coming up with a Raptor Rap. (\"Yo, yo, see me/I'm livin' below the soil/I'll be back/But I'm comin' as oil.\") But if this film creates as good a showcase for the Williams zaniness as anything short of \"Aladdin,\" it also spends too much time making nice.

Two witnesses in Federal District Court in Manhattan representing two manufacturers of industrial gas testified that they received inquiries or orders for gas. One of them, Evans Humenick, a salesman for Liquid Carbonic Industries in Bethlehem, Pa., said that one of the defendants, Nidal A. Ayyad, a chemical engineer who worked at the Allied-Signal Corporation in New Jersey, called on the telephone to ask about buying gas.

The Roman Catholic Church has never been and, it may be hoped, never will be a democratic institution. Rather, the Roman Catholic Church bases its positions on such controversial issues as abortion and homosexuality on Scripture and tradition. Neither lend themselves well to the pressures of democratic society.   Why does Ms. Quindlen find it so necessary to attack the American Catholic bishops? I can postulate only that such people (including groups like Catholics for a Free Choice) are frustrated by their inability to engineer the church in the same way they have been able to engineer society.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931125","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/25/nyregion/c-corrections-014893.html","abstract":"  An article in Science Times on Nov. 9, about a study showing that being cautious and somewhat dour is a key to longevity, misidentified the issue of The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in which it appeared.
