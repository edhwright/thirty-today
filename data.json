The snowfall in that famous \"Blizzard of '88\" was three-quarters of an inch more than the 20.2 inches measured in Central Park this time, but came as a complete surprise, with hurricane-force winds. Added to the awful human toll was the stunning blow to society's cocky self-confidence at the dawn of the age of modern invention. \n\n     Following the mildest winter in 16 years, the city was ready for springtime.  The weather \"indication\" that day -- forecasts were not yet called forecasts --  was \"slightly warmer, fair weather followed by rain.\" Barnum & Bailey's circus was in town, and the morning paper published Walt Whitman's new poem, \"The First Dandelion.\" But spring would have to wait.
