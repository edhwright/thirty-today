Following a series of rediscoveries, most prominently by the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, he is now accepted as a seminal figure in the history of blues.   The playwright Bill Harris has taken Johnson's music and what is known of his secretive life and woven them together with a story of his own invention. The result is \"Robert Johnson: Trick the Devil,\" a high-spirited and often rhapsodic search for the musician's soul.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930225","headline":"Davis Cup?

The gold medal was Russia's third in the championships. Norway leads with five gold medals. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD  Powell Wins Down Under  The world-record holder, Mike Powell of the United States, won the long jump yesterday in the NEC International meet at Olympic Park in Melbourne, with a mark of 27 feet, the longest ever in Australia. Powell set the world record of 29-4 1/2 in the 1991 world championships in Tokyo. Dave Culbert of Australia finished second in 25-7 1/2 and Gordon Laine was third at 25-3 1/4. (AP) TENNIS  7 Double Faults, 1 Victory  Third-seeded MaliVai Washington overcame seven double faults and a strong effort from Marcelo Filippini for a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Purex Tennis Championships in Scottsdale, Ariz. No. 7 Emilio Sanchez of Spain and an Australian, Mark Woodforde, had straight-set victories in the $275,000 ATP Tour stop. Sanchez needed tie breakers to eliminate Gabriel Marcos, 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (14-12). Woodforde, who won the United States Indoor tournament in Philadelphia last week, continued his streak with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Luiz Mattar of Brazil. (AP) Ivanisevic Gains: Second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia advanced to the quarterfinals of the World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, yesterday with a 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5) victory over unseeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel. The hard-serving Ivanisevic is the tournament favorite following the withdrawal of an ailing Boris Becker. Among other matches, Anders Jarryd of Sweden easily moved into the quarterfinals, beating Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 6-3, 6-4. Goran Prpic of Croatia, who on Wednesday upset fourth-seeded Richard Krajicek, lost, 6-2, 6-3, to Andrei Olchovsky of Russia.

Ms. Shea's latest efforts eschew bronze for wood and draw on humbler sources -- folk sculpture, dolls, the cigar store Indian and the shop window mannequin -- while recouping the Egyptian simplicity that informed her early work. The resulting pieces, four in handcarved pine with horsehair and one in cast steel, are the most commanding and emotionally complex she has made.

In her serenely measured performances, Ms. Zahn, whose previous acts have looked deeply into the theater songs of Leonard Bernstein and Charles Strouse, focuses on Leigh's craft and lets the sex speak for itself.

Long before it was fashionable, the Meat Puppets were promoting a kind of nouveau-hippie youth revolution. Over the course of 12 years and nearly as many releases, this Arizona trio has meandered from hardcore to country to grunge and back again, switching between long, dizzy guitar improvisations and head-banging, hair-shaking metal; the lyrics are odes to a perennial state of pleasant confusion. Tonight and tomorrow night, the Puppets play an acoustic set at 9, which will highlight some of the melodic subtleties of their countryish side; their electric set, at midnight, might come off like a cross between Pearl Jam and the Grateful Dead. Admission: $10. Bodeco at CBGB     Bodeco, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. There's nothing quaint, cute or five-and-dime about Bodeco's brand of rockabilly. Greasy as a truck-stop burger and bumpier than a high-speed ride in the back of a pickup, this band of Louisville wild men eschews retro contrivances in favor of gristle, marrow and the occasional backwoods yowl. Choice cuts from \"Bone, Hair and Hide,\" Bodeco's 1992 release on the independent label Homestead, include \"Hong Kong, Mississippi,\" \"Holy Rollers Rockin' in a Killin' Machine\" and \"Casillero del Diablo.\" Also on tomorrow night's bill are the Friggs, an all-female dance-party garage band, and the Lyres, longstanding defenders of the late-60's punk ethic. Music starts around 9:30 P.M. Admission: $8. Distortion With Melody    Polvo, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. These days, no self-respecting young guitar band would go far without packing a little distortion, but Polvo dispenses with it more sparingly than most. Substituting flowery melodic phrases for chopped-up chords, and relegating monotone vocals to the back seat, Polvo emphasizes atmosphere over action, obscurity over clarity. Most of the band's songs seem to be about sitting around the house, but lyrics aren't really the point here; it's the hazy, pretty guitar lines that are supposed to ignite the imagination and take the listener along on the ride.

Dinkins's deepest contact with the realities of urban life here -- and the contrasts with his own city -- probably came in Kazuko Mishimura's sixth-grade mathematics class at the Chuo Elementary School.   When Mr. Dinkins stepped into the public school in the heart of the city's most densely packed neighborhood, the students had just taken a break from some fairly complicated geometry lessons that were still perfectly sketched across the blackboard. Each of them was dressed in the school uniform: blue blazers for everyone, red bows and skirts for the girls, red bow ties and shorts for the boys. Their identical leather book bags were stored in neat rows against the back wall. This was no show for the Mayor: Walk into any Japanese school and the scene is the same. Comparing Urban Living    \"I can see this is not a school with a discipline problem,\" Mr. Dinkins said later as he made his way down the corridors, which are lined with the shoes the students take off before they step into the classrooms.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930226","headline":"No Prejudice Within the Pinstripes, Say Yankees","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/sports/baseball-no-prejudice-within-the-pinstripes-say-yankees.html","abstract":"  In a week in which baseball found itself again being pushed by the Rev.

Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, won renewed state accreditation today after a contentious public meeting.    By a vote of 7 to 3, the Board of Governors of the State Department of Higher Education re-accredited the university through June 30, 1995.   Terms of accreditation are commonly longer, to a maximum of five years. A Department of Higher Education official said the abbreviated term reflected concern that the school had been taken over by a group that might interfere in academic affairs.   Trustees of the private, 1,400-student university and school officials spoke of the need to maintain the school as a resource in a struggling city. They argued that the group that has taken over the university, the Professors World Peace Academy, is separate from the Unification Church, although it is almost totally financed by the church. Pep Rally Atmosphere    Much of today's meeting at the Greater Hartford Community College had the air of a pep rally as about 250 students, bused in from the university, erupted periodically in applause and whoops of appreciation for advocates of continued accreditation.    \"I'm delighted by this confirmation and the ability to go forward and keep doing what we've been doing for 65 years, to provide education to a broad spectrum of people,\" said Walter Wager, a university spokesman.    University officials said the school has complied with the board's requirements, which call for an independent, self-governing panel to oversee the school's operation. However, the three board members who voted against accreditation said they were concerned that the agreement between the Professors World Peace Academy and the university did not meet state standards.    The board's vice chairman, Marie C. O'Brien, of Bristol, said she had \"serious concerns\" about the future of academic freedom at the university. And Helen B. Wasserman, of Fairfield, another board member, said the agreement between the academy and the university \"is not in keeping with either the spirit or the specific guidelines\" of state law.   The university's previous two-year term of accreditation expired Jan. 31. But its status was extended when the board of governors postponed its decision for a month to study issues related to the running of the university and the role of the Professors World Peace Academy.   If the university had failed to win accreditation, it would have been unable to grant degrees or participate in Federal financial aid programs, and probably would have closed. Re-evaluation Next Year    In re-accrediting the university, the board followed a recommendation by Andrew G. DeRocco, the higher education commissioner. He called for the 29-month period \"to allow time for the university to come into full compliance\" with board standards.   Mark E. Ojakian, an aide to Mr. DeRocco, said the term of the accreditation was \"a little less than normal, but there have been instances when two years has been used.\" Under the commissioner's recommendation, the school's status will be re-evaluated by the board in 1994.   Last year, the Department of Higher Education found that the university did not comply with several of its standards. However, \"Since then, the university has shown affirmative action in addressing the outstanding issues, to include revision of its bylaws to comply\" with board standards of administration, Mr. DeRocco said in his recommendation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930227","headline":"BRIEFCASE: Fidelity Issues a Fund Guide To Aid Newcomers to Market","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/your-money/IHT-briefcase-fidelity-issues-a-fund-guide-to-aid-newcomers-to.html","abstract":"Fidelity Investments is offering a free booklet intended to help newcomers to fund ownership make their first purchase.

Long before 40-year-old Eamonn Coghlan came within 1.39 seconds of his precious four-minute Masters mile, or Noureddine Morceli of Algeria outkicked stubborn Marcus O'Sullivan over the final lap of their mile duel, Devers required less than seven seconds to sprint 60 meters, a blur across the length of the Madison Square Garden floor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930227","headline":"Judge Allows Group to Bar Gay Marchers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/nyregion/judge-allows-group-to-bar-gay-marchers.html","abstract":"  The Dinkins administration cannot force the Ancient Order of Hibernians to include a gay group in the St. Patrick's Day Parade, and must permit the Hibernians to sponsor this year's march up Fifth Avenue, a Federal judge ruled yesterday.

This work, just over an hour in length, is meant to be a \"family opera,\" able to attract children and new audiences to the art form that, along with the rest of the art-music tradition, has no role in contemporary public education. So the Metropolitan Opera Guild decided to commission and produce the work with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (which will present it in April), and is scheduling performances for school classes as well as for the general public. Its New York run will continue through March 7 at the theater (899 10th Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930227","headline":"EXPLOSION AT THE TWIN TOWERS: The Response; Size of Blast 'Destroyed' Rescue Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/nyregion/explosion-at-the-twin-towers-the-response-size-of-blast-destroyed-rescue-plan.html","abstract":"  Evacuation plans for the World Trade Center were rendered useless yesterday because the explosion devastated its police command and operations centers, Port Authority officials said.
