For that reason alone, what happened yesterday in Brooklyn was noteworthy.   A scheduled protest by Arab-Americans in Midwood, Brooklyn, against the militant Zionist group Kahane Chai was called off at the request of a local Jewish politician. Instead, Jewish and Arab leaders met for 75 minutes in the basement of a police station, emerging to blow away some of the rhetorical heat rising from the violence here and in the Middle East.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940307","headline":"Review/Theater; A Fantastic Voyage Into Medical History","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/07/theater/review-theater-a-fantastic-voyage-into-medical-history.html","abstract":"  The performance artist Theodora Skipitares, who usually uses puppets in miniature environments to comment on society, has dramatically upped the ante in \"Under the Knife,\" a spooky romp through the annals of death and medicine.

Yugoslav republic, Macedonia, by imposing a strangling economic blockade. Greece's Western allies understand that Athens has had serious problems with Macedonia in the past. But they are losing patience with Greece's bullying tactics against a much weaker neighbor already suffering ethnic tensions.   Ancient Macedonia was the homeland of Alexander the Great. Modern Macedonia was, for most of this century, part Greek, part Yugoslav. During the Greek civil war of the late 1940's, Yugoslavia allied itself with the losing Communist side, and at one point Marshal Tito tried to assert his authority over all of Macedonia. Greece, not yet a NATO member and threatened by what seemed to be global Communism, was traumatized.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"Through Bosnian Smoke, Russians and Serbs Turn to the West; Give Clinton Credit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/opinion/l-through-bosnian-smoke-russians-and-serbs-turn-to-the-west-give-clinton-credit-402710.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As an American businessman stationed in Paris and one who has helped United States physicians and medical supplies enter Sarajevo, I believe the Clinton Administration has been 100 percent correct in keeping our soldiers out of the former Yugoslavia as long as possible.

The results were spectacular. As familiar as Mr. Kissin's fabulous technique has become, it is hard to take for granted; he is, after all, only 22.   Still, the less showy moments earlier in the evening were almost more impressive in their maturity. Mr. Kissin began with excellent performances of two Schumann works. At the start of the \"Arabesque\" (Op. 18), all the rippling notes seemed to dissolve in eloquent long-breathed phrases. The outer movement of the Fantasy in C (Op. 17) had a fine reflective quality; in the middle movement, some smudges at the first return of the big chords came as welcome reassurance that Mr. Kissin is only human, however much the later evidence seemed to suggest otherwise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940309","headline":"ISRAELI ARMY SAYS SECURITY WAS LAX AT MASSACRE SITE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/09/world/israeli-army-says-security-was-lax-at-massacre-site.html","abstract":"  Israel began its formal inquiry into the Hebron massacre today with the army commander for the West Bank testifying that a breakdown had occurred in security arrangements that could have prevented the mass killing of Palestinian worshipers by an Israeli settler.
