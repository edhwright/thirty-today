Today, it is the center of what demographers say is the fastest-growing Hispanic population in the country, a new promised land for Puerto Ricans in San Juan and New York who are fleeing crime, overcrowding and urban angst.   From 1980 to 1990, the Hispanic population of Osceola County, which is just south of Orlando and includes much of Disney World, grew by 1,082 percent, the largest percentage increase of any county in the United States, according to census data. Hispanic people constituted more than 10 percent of the county's population of 107,000 in 1990 and are expected to account for as much as a quarter of a population of nearly 200,000 by the end of the decade.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940131","headline":"The Defense Wrests: Washington Got Everything but the M.V.P.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/sports/super-bowl-xxviii-the-defense-wrests-washington-got-everything-but-the-mvp.html","abstract":"  The Dallas Cowboys are a team that thrives on big plays.

It was a concert dedicated not to pop melody or pop emotion, but to the immediate pleasures of kinetic rhythm.   It was, in part, an international exposition: pop-flamenco from the Spanish guitarist Rene Heredia, booming and strutting traditional drum music from Les Percussions de Guinea; a bass solo by Armand Sabal-Lecco, from Cameroon; and subtle, propulsive pieces by Uakti, who nearly stole the show with the novel sounds of homemade instruments. It was also an attempt to create a musical fusion not dominated by American ideas about pop structure; some of the lyrics were not in English, and few of them mattered as much as the momentum behind them. The music left the audience dancing, not humming tunes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Connecticut Finds Itself In the Land of the Elite","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/sports/college-basketball-connecticut-finds-itself-in-the-land-of-the-elite.html","abstract":"  Connecticut cleared another hurdle at Pittsburgh on Saturday, this time without its head coach, and the Huskies are now farther into territory never before explored by a UConn men's basketball team.

The leaders, Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the chief British official in the North, seem to believe that they can convince the president of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, that their proposal is not a trap and that it provides a basis for negotiations that he and the I.R.A. can accept without compromising their ultimate goal of a united Ireland free of British control.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Buffalo Fans Turn Ugly As Hopes Fade Away","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/sports/super-bowl-xxviii-buffalo-fans-turn-ugly-as-hopes-fade-away.html","abstract":"  The collective dream once again turned into a recurring nightmare and the anger erupted even before the players left the Atlanta field.   \"I hope they never come back; I hope they stay down in Atlanta -- forever,\" a devastated Dan Benesk, a United States Army recruiter, said as he watched the final minutes of the Super Bowl in a cavernous nightclub in which the Bills' quarterback, Jim Kelly, is the name partner.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"St. John's New Name: How About Red-Faced?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/sports/college-basketball-st-john-s-new-name-how-about-red-faced.html","abstract":"  Shawnelle Scott draped a towel over his shoulders and took a long look around the half-empty Madison Square Garden during a late-game timeout.

It aims to involve police departments in crime prevention, not just crime reaction, by assigning more officers to street patrol, exposing them to neighborhood concerns and training them to identify troubled individuals and bring in social service agencies to provide help.    President Clinton lauded the idea in his State of the Union address, using New York City's program as a prime example.

A year ago, President Clinton asked an interagency working group to establish a less secretive system for classifying documents. The working group labored, and came up with a draft executive order last November, which (naturally) was kept secret. Fortunately, a copy was leaked to the Federation of American Scientists. And lo, the federation found that while suggesting a few modest reforms, the draft order would actually close the shutters tighter.    The draft order proposes, with a few exceptions, a maximum classification lifetime of 40 years. As the federation's analysts point out, Richard Nixon set a maximum of 30 years for most classified documents, and Jimmy Carter fixed the limit at 20 years. This extended period outweighs the hypothetical benefit of a \"balancing test\" that would allow declassifiers to weigh the public interest against national security concerns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Books of The Times; Dying, a Necessary End, Seems Not an Easy Job","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/books/books-of-the-times-dying-a-necessary-end-seems-not-an-easy-job.html","abstract":"  How We Die  Reflections on Life's Final Chapter  By Sherwin B.

Like good poetry, his best dances have a way of speaking truths in a language that is familiar but not quite of the everyday world. Those truths have often been about how moving bodies defined the empty space around them. But over the last few years the choreographer, now 84, seems to be zeroing in on body shapes, parts and gentle eccentricities, as he does in \"Each Time You Carry Me This Way,\" a 1993 work performed by the Erick Hawkins Dance Company on Thursday night at the Joyce Theater.    The theme of the dance, which is set to a vividly atmospheric score by Lucia Dlugoszewski, is how to carry and be carried. Mr. Hawkins suggests a remarkable variety of emotions and relationships with just the angle of the held body or the way it holds onto its moving carrier. Dancers spill out of the stage wings, lapping leftward across the stage in staggered processionals and pools of moving bodies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940201","headline":"Study Bolsters Value Of Species Diversity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/01/science/study-bolsters-value-of-species-diversity.html","abstract":"  CONSERVATIONISTS widely believe that the more species an ecosystem contains, the more robust and stable it will be.

His enclave in the Falls Road in West Belfast is row on row of diminutive red-brick houses cleaved together, his flock 100,000 or so Roman Catholics.

Yet bringing about or even commencing on a lasting peace in Ireland is not an easy task. Behind Mr. Adams must lurk not only the memory but the reality of the last peace process, hammered out by Michael Collins in 1922, whereby the six counties of Northern Ireland were severed from the 26 in the Republic of Ireland, a matter that led to a bloody civil war and caused Collins to say he had signed his own death warrant -- as indeed he had, ambushed not long after in his native County Cork in a place tenderly called \"the Mouth of the Flowers.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940201","headline":"Simms May Require Shoulder Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/01/sports/pro-football-simms-may-require-shoulder-surgery.html","abstract":"  Moderate but persistent irritation in his throwing shoulder may force Phil Simms to have arthroscopic surgery in the next few weeks.

What to do? The National Academy of Sciences has some useful ideas.    Highly enriched uranium extracted from warheads is relatively easy to render militarily harmless. Once blended down, it can fuel power plants but cannot be used for warheads without re-enrichment. In contrast, plutonium separated from spent fuel is usable in warheads.
