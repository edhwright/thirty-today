He propped his chronically swollen feet on two pillows, accepted a bowl of cereal and a plate of fruit, and commenced a daylong demonstration of his art of the presidency.   It was 6 A.M. on his 122d day as liberator-turned-chief-executive, and he had agreed to let two reporters watch him do his job. Never a man oblivious of his audience, Mr. Mandela promptly embarked on a campaign of seductive engagement: deliberate charm, disarming confidences, a command of details mustered in defense of crisp convictions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"For Giuliani, Primary Dance Is the Sidestep","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/nyregion/political-memo-for-giuliani-primary-dance-is-the-sidestep.html","abstract":"  Picture these two late-summer snapshots from the New York campaign scrapbook:    On the left, Gov.

One moment, Mr. Scaggs sounds like a raw Texan blues singer, then with a slight softening of tone he metamorphoses into a patrician San Franciscan pop crooner. The change from one thing into another isn't so much a matter of self-conscious role-playing as it is of allowing different facets of a many-layered musical personality to edge to the fore.    The singer, who performed at Town Hall in Manhattan with a five-member band and two backup vocalists on Saturday and Sunday, started out as a Texan blues-rock singer. He reached his peak of popularity in 1976 with a sophisticated pop-soul album, \"Silk Degrees,\" which had something of a disco ambiance. His best-loved songs include romantic ballads like \"Harbor Lights\" and \"We're All Alone\" in which his reedy, quirky pop baritone projects considerable tension and vulnerability. Although the music on his newest album, \"Some Change\" (Virgin), is tougher and more guitar-oriented than it is on his earlier records, the songs also have a brooding, introspective undertone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"Flawed Characters In the Public Eye, Past and Present","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/movies/flawed-characters-in-the-public-eye-past-and-present.html","abstract":"  Paul Attanasio was born in 1959, the same year the quiz show scandal on television stunned and outraged the nation.

In return, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and Russia will ask the U.N. Security Council to begin easing sanctions on the Yugoslav Federation, now consisting only of Serbia and Montenegro.    That makes sense -- if the monitors can verify that the embargo is really being enforced. The U.N. imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia to get Belgrade to cut off the Bosnian Serbs. If that is what Belgrade is now doing, it deserves relief. The first steps planned, reopening Yugoslavia's airports to international flights and allowing its citizens to participate in international sporting and cultural events, are harmless enough in themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"The World Through Discolored Glasses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/arts/pop-review-the-world-through-discolored-glasses.html","abstract":"  The Fall, which performed on Saturday night at Tramps, is a stubbornly good band. Seventeen years after it formed, this English group continues to play by its own rules. It releases as many as three albums a year and produces each with a gritty, low-fidelity sound. Its cantankerous singer, Mark E. Smith, writes infectiously cynical songs, sings in eccentric rhythms and cadences in which nearly every line ends in \"uh,\" and is well known for punching out members of his own road crew.   On Saturday, the Fall was joined by Mr. Smith's ex-wife, Brix, who left the band in 1989 but rejoined it last month. Her sharp, simple bass and guitar lines funneled the band's diverse energies into hard-hitting post-punk.

Ten members of New York's police force have killed themselves this year, equaling the number in 1987, the worst year until now.    The suicides, including two last Tuesday, have brought renewed attention to a long-smoldering problem on the police force: the depth of suspicion that troubled officers have for the department's array of counseling services. Most officers shun them for fear of jeopardizing their careers or out of a stubborn attitude that they should deal with their own ordeals. And many sergeants are loath to report tormented officers because they do not want to be looked upon as the heavy. Of the 10 policemen who took their lives this year, only one was being treated by a department psychologist.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940912","headline":"In Immigration Labyrinth, Corruption Comes Easily","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/us/in-immigration-labyrinth-corruption-comes-easily.html","abstract":"  Up and down the East Coast, the word quickly spread through immigrant communities.

The opera is a singspiel, and there is a fair amount of spiel between songs. It makes no sense to have singers jabbering at one another in German with English translations overhead.

International Tournament in Novgorod, Russia. His defeat of his 19-year-old protege was the most imaginative game in the elite, double-round competition, which ended in late August.   It also gave Kasparov, a Russian, a point toward the total of 7-3, which was good for a first place tie with Vasily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. Kasparov led throughout, but when he drew his last three games, Ivanchuk overhauled him. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . W. . . . L. . . . D. . . . Pts. Kasparov . . . 4 . . . 0 . . . 6 . . . 7 Ivanchuk . . . 4 . . . 0 . . . 6 . . . 7 Kramnik . . . 3 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 Short . . . 0 . . . 2 . . . 8 . . . 4 Shirov . . . 1 . . . 3 . . . 6 . . . 4 Bareyev . . . 1 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3   This time Kasparov did not look as though he might have any ambivalent feelings toward the young grandmaster whose career he had done so much to further. He showered the hapless Kramnik, also of Russia, with a veritable cascade of fireworks.     The Pelikan Variation of the Sicilian Defense presents a dramatic confrontation in its chief lines: after 10 Bf6 Bf6 11 c3, Black has the bishop-pair as against White's occupation of the weak d5 square with his knight.   Once Kasparov had revealed his plans for a mating attack with 13 h4!?, Kramnik challenged the d5 knight with 13 . . . Ne7. He was, of course, aware that 14 Nf6 gf damages the black king position, but after 15 Qd2 Bb7 16 Bd3 d5, he counted on using his central pawn phalanx as a counterweapon.   On 17 ed Qd5 18 O-O-O!? e4 19 Be2, Kramnik could have prevented a white mating attack with 19 . . . Qd2 20 Rd2, but with three pawns stopping four black ones on the kingside, while the healthy white queenside pawn majority would eventually yield a powerful passed pawn, the endgame prospects would strongly favor Kasparov. By accepting the pawn sacrifice with 19 . . . Qa2, Kramnik banished endgame worries.   After 20 Qh6 Qe6 21 Nd4, Kramnik might have tried to keep his queen centralized with 21 . . . Qe5, but then 22 f4! ef 23 gf Ng6 24 Rdg1! Kh8 25 Kb1 Rg8 (25 . . . Qf4? loses a piece to 26 Rg6!) 26 Bd3 Nf8 27 Rg8 Kg8 28 Bh7! Nh7 29 Rg1 Ng5 30 hg f5 31 g6! is overwhelming for White.   On 21 . . . Qb6, Kasparov kept mobilizing with 22 Rh3 Kh8 23 Bg4!, which threatened 24 Bf5 Nf5 25 Nf5 Rg8 26 Rd6 followed by 27 Qf6, winning outright. After 23 . . . Rg8, Kasparov produced the fantastic 24 Ne6!, planning to crush 24 . . . fe by 25 Qf6 Rg7 26 Rd7 Re8 27 Rg3 Bc8 28 Re7 Re7 29 Qf8 Rg8 30 Qg8! Kg8 31 Be6 Kf8 32 Rg8 mate.   Moreover, taking the other sacrificed piece with 24 . . . Rg4 is smashed by 25 Ng5! Rg5 (25 . . . fg drops the queen to 26 Qb6) 26 hg Kg8 27 gf. And defense by 24 . . . Qf2 fails against 25 Rf3! Rg6 26 Qg6 Qb2 27 Kb2 Ng6 28 Rf6 fe 29 Be6, which gives White a winning ending.   Kramnik struggled nobly on with 24 . . . Rg6 25 Qf4 Re8 26 Rd6, but it would not have saved him to try 26 . . . Qa5 27 h5 Qa1 28 Kc2 Qa4 29 Kb1 Rg4 30 Qg4 Rg8 31 Rd8! fe 32 Rg8 Ng8 33 Rg3. In this same hypothetical line, 30 . . . fe 31 Qe6 e3 32 Qf6 Kg8 33 Rg3 Ng6 34 Rg6 hg 35 Qg6 Kf8 36 Qh6 Kf7 37 Qh7 would lead into 37 . . . Kf8 38 Rf6 mate.   Kramnik tried 26 . . . Nd5, but Kasparov fired another salvo with 27 h5! Kramnik could not play 27 . . . Rg4 because 28 Qg4 Rg8 29 Qg8 Kg8 30 Rg3 Kh8 31 Rd8! Qd8 32 Nd8 forces 32 . . . h6 to stop 33 Nf7 mate, after which 33 Nb7 puts Kasparov a rook ahead.   So he went ahead with 27 . . . Nf4 28 hg! Qd6 (28 . . . Nd3 is broken by 29 Rhd3! ed 30 gf) 29 Rh7 Kg8 30 gf Kh7 31 fe/Q Ne6, but after 32 Bf5! Kg7 33 Qg6 Kf8 34 Qf6 Ke8 35 Be6, Kramnik was a decisive pawn down and his king was in a wretched position.   He could not even reduce the pawns by 35 . . . e3 because 36 fe Bg2 37 Bf7 Kd7 38 Be8 Kc7 39 Qg7 Kd8 40 Bb5 Bf3 41 Ba4 just loses more material. Not that it affected the outcome of the game, but Kramnik blundered in time pressure with 35 . . . Qf8? and at once, seeing that 36 Bd7 wins his queen, he gave up without waiting for the move to be put on the board.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940913","headline":"Jury Selection in Tailhook Negligence Suit Begins in Nevada","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/13/us/jury-selection-in-tailhook-negligence-suit-begins-in-nevada.html","abstract":"  Jury selection began here today in a civil trial involving one of the most sordid and divisive episodes in the history of the United States Navy.

But lest their singing be dismissed as so much senseless muddle, researchers say the tamarins' vocal repertory of 38 distinct sounds is unusually sophisticated, even by primate standards.

But the staffs of the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and the bipartisan Mainstream Coalition continued to talk and have reportedly reached substantial agreement. Though the emerging bill would be incremental -- leaving some individuals uninsured -- it would improve health care for most Americans. Incremental reform would be substantial reform.   Why, then, does passage seem so distant? Standing in the way are political calculations by Robert Dole, the minority leader of the Senate, and Richard Gephardt, the majority leader of the House. They have yet to decide whether to go for limited reform this year or use defeat as an election-year strategy. Health care security for millions hangs in the balance because no one expects Congress to rebound from total defeat this year to pass reform next year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/nyregion/metro-digest-233188.html","abstract":"  THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: TO THE VICTORS, ANOTHER RUN   State Senator George E.

He crashed into and damaged American faith in the protective capabilities of technology and security forces.   Radar and heat-seeking missiles are useful tools. The Secret Service, like any human organization, has its strengths, most of which derive from the selfless bravery of members who really are willing to die in the line of duty. But no technical wizardry and courage can forever disguise one of the grimmest facts of modern history. Even the most advanced society is never far above what William Butler Yeats called the \"bestial floor\" of human disorder, and the nets constructed above that floor are weaker than most dare to imagine. - Perhaps the military triumphs of the early 20th century gave Americans an exaggerated confidence in protective machines and bureaucracies. Even in Washington, where fallibility is ever on parade, officials and journalists share that faith. In the early 80's, a high fence was erected between the Treasury building and the White House, and behind that fence a mighty excavation went on for months. The grapevine buzzed with talk that some advanced and highly competent security work was being installed to protect the Executive Mansion from terrorist tricks.   Newspapers and broadcasters, out of a well-placed sense of responsibility, have never reported in much detail about what is lodged in the bunkers and on the rooftops around Pennsylvania Avenue. There was a widespread impression -- a faith, if you will -- that these locations housed devices of great potency for diverting or exploding incoming threats from land or air.   Mr. Corder's mad and silent glide into the Andrew Jackson magnolia has rent a hole in that faith. The White House may well be protected by radars capable of detecting an intruder violating its airspace and by artillery and missiles capable of downing aircraft. But response time is limited and firing off weapons in Washington's crowded streets or air corridors is risky to the lives of many.   What is supposed to protect the White House is, of course, a notion much more valuable and, if it can be sustained, much more powerful than weaponry and sharpshooters. It is the idea that Americans want and deserve to be governed by a person living in a house on a street close to comings and goings of citizens.

Which is not to say that the conception is bland; Paul Shortt's sets, with their sun-worn Mediterranean colors and rugged surfaces, shroud the action in palpable atmosphere. This \"Carmen\" has an exact comprehension of time and place.   But there's little in the production that calls attention to itself or strives for whimsy. The village square in Act I is set off by stark columns and overhung with light-filtering blinds.  The mountain pass in Act III, Scene 1 is given focus by the ominous form of a ruined church. The final scene has a splendid sense of depth, and the imposing gate to the bull ring strongly suggests the festive space offstage so important to the conclusion's multi-layered effect. Jeff Davis's lighting gives a bronze luster to each scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"Strengthening an Alliance : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/opinion/IHT-strengthening-an-alliance-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"The Case for Giving NATO an American Secretary- General\" (Opinion, Aug. 19) by David M.
