In Stamford the Rogers School will be reborn as the Rogers Magnet School in September. Currently the school enrollment of 635 is 69.3 percent racial and ethnic minorities, a mixture of Haitian, Hispanic and Asian children. About 250 students are currently enrolled in the English as a Second Language program and will remain. By recruiting 125 new white students, Rogers will attain an ethnic balance of 50-50.

Looming over the dark, sometimes rank canals, crumbling buildings stand silently with shuttered windows. Empty campielli -- paved squares -- echo eerily during long quiet off-season afternoons. Walking on the Lido, readers who have never opened its pages may think of Thomas Mann's \"Death in Venice.\"   Inside many churches, black shriveled relics and even whole corpses of saints lie under glass. In museums, paintings of the Crucifixion, Deposition and assorted martyrs evoke death and decay in mesmerizing detail. Even the gloriously celebratory Sala del Maggior Consiglio, the assembly hall in the Doge's Palace, is dominated by a huge \"Paradiso\" by Tintoretto, whose heaven is filled with more resurrected bodies than might be possibly fit into the cavernous hall. Death hovers almost companionably over Venice, as if it were one of the masked carnival-goers whose inscrutable pictured faces peer out of almost every shop window.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"In the Region: Westchester; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-recent-sales.html","abstract":"  Port Chester, N.Y.  $175,000   531 Irving Avenue  3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath, 70-year-old Colonial; dining room, in-law apartment, detached one-car garage; taxes, $4,880.

This last volume starts in 1960 in Cambridge, Mass., where Wilson was teaching, conveniently close to his Cape Cod house in Wellfleet, Mass., and ends in upstate New York, at Talcottville, in June 1972. In it, we see his slow decline. Here are excerpts.\nCambridge, Spring 1960\n\nI HAVE sometimes lately had the impression that my appearance and personality have almost entirely disappeared, and that there is little but my books marching through me: the Indian book, the Civil War. They live, I am ceasing to live. But this is partly due to too much drinking, reading and thinking at night, then plunging into work at the library. \n[\nA friend\n]\n lays off drink twice a year for ten days or two weeks. He thus loses, he says, about seven pounds and reduces that bloated look. Inspired by this noble example, I have adopted the same course -- beginning on my 65th birthday -- and feel much the better for it. My contacts with life have become more normal, and I find that I will have to make a new hole in my belt.\nTalcottville, Summer 1961\n\n As a character in one of Chekhov's plays says he's \"a man of the 80's,\" so I find that I am a man of the 20's. I still expect something exciting: drinks, animated conversation, gaiety: an uninhibited exchange of ideas. Scott Fitzgerald's idea that somewhere things were \"glimmering.\" I am managing to discipline myself now so that I shan't be silly in this way. \nNew York, Winter 1962\n\n Had dinner with Wystan Auden before Elena \n[\nWilson's wife\n]\n arrived. He was pleased at having what he described as an honor on the part of the Establishment. He has been made an honorary fellow (I think that is the phrase) of Christ Church \n[\nCollege, Oxford\n]\n. I gather that he can retire and live there for nothing. He thinks that \"Down There on a Visit\" is Isherwood's best book -- I was just in the middle of reading it. He says the disintegrating homo on his horrible island in Greece was a real person whom he knew and the only person he knew who would drink the spirits out of lamps when there was nothing else to be had. He thought that \"Paul\" was the best of the stories. I agreed with him when I came to read it; but the whole book is rather disgusting. I am getting sick of this subject. The attitude in these books toward homosexuality involves of course a revolt against society. See the diatribe of the man on the island about putting the heterosexuals in ghettos. Paul is made by Isherwood into a hero. But Genet is the best of these writers. He is the most in revolt, the most genuinely an outlaw. \nCambridge, Spring 1962\n\n My ailments -- heart, teeth and gout -- and having endured another winter in Cambridge have lately been getting me down. I drink too much to get me out of my depression, then relapse into something like despair. The other night, after an active and serious day, I had a paroxysm of exasperation with Elena combined with an acute heart attack and smashed her filing cabinet, her typewriter and something else made of glass. She was frightened and called \n[\nthe novelist\n]\n Monroe Engel \n[\nacross the street\n]\n, who got me a doctor. He checked my pulse and my heart and gave me a shot in the arm to put me to sleep.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"The Man Who Wouldn't Be Prime Minister","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/books/the-man-who-wouldnt-be-prime-minister.html","abstract":"A LIFE AT THE CENTER\nMemoirs of a Radical Reformer.\nBy Roy Jenkins.\nIllustrated. 585 pp. New York:\nRandom House. $30.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Tactical Technology Fights Counterfeiters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/style/stamps-tactical-technology-fights-counterfeiters.html","abstract":"  AS color-copying technology becomes more accurate, postal authorities, concerned about counterfeiting, are using more elaborate security measures in printing stamps.

In an issue where positions are often entrenched, the change of heart by Mr. Aniskovich and some other lawmakers, and their willingness to reconsider gun control in light of new arguments and rising crime, has dramatically raised hopes that the bill could pass.

They are discovering not only a pleasant coastal city with palm-shaded beaches but also a treasure-trove of intricately woven yet inexpensive lace -- bone and labyrinth laces, made primarily in small villages along Brazil's northeastern shore, and Renaissance lace from inland villages in Pernambuco State, farther south.    Portuguese colonists brought their native tradition of weaving renda, or lace, to Brazil in the early 17th century. Designs and stitches were influenced by the regular visits of Spanish and French merchants, who distributed models of new kinds of lace popular in Europe. Centuries later, Ceara women still make lace in the shady daylight of their front doorways or under gazebos roofed in straw or tile. And Brazilians still sing this folk lyric: Hey, lace maker. Hey, woman making lace. If you will teach me to make lace, I will teach you to fall in love.   The traditions, techniques and lore of lace making are passed informally from one generation of women to the next. Wives and daughters of fishermen or farmers create lace collars, doilies and tablecloths to sell to supplement their families' income.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Jennifer Whyman, David N.

Richard Norton, an official of the Air Transport Association, questioned the new passport's effectiveness in preventing the kind of tampering that would allow people to enter the United States illegally. Appearing on April 27 before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on International Law, Immigration and Refugees, Mr. Norton said the airline industry supported efforts to improve immigration inspection with technological innovations, but he called the new passport \"a flawed design.\"   Inside the new passport there is a device called a kinegram, which is similar to the holograms used on credit cards.

The space in Lake Success and Woodbury must be rented to other businesses when Olympus vacates the premises. If no rental occurs, then the developer and owner must pay the taxes. How many years can that go on, if no income comes in? The owner becomes bankrupt.   3. There will be an increase in taxes to the school district in 11 years and also to the other taxing jurisdictions. Suffolk County I.D.A. is giving Parr/ Olympus 10 percent increments for 10 years, until the total assessment comes due in the 11th year. The Town of Huntington starts with 50 percent of the tax assessment and 5 percent increments over 10 years. We, the taxpayers in Suffolk County and Huntington, lose big! Our taxes must make up the difference.   4. Opposition to the Olympus project is not just \"limited to a few households that are near or adjacent to the proposed site.\" Triangle has 1,179 paid members. We are part of Melville Civic Organizations, consisting of nine Melville civic groups. In addition Dix Hills civic associations also oppose this project. That is at least 2,000 to 2,500 people. The Huntington Town Board unanimously voted to oppose this project on the grounds that New York State is overriding local zoning. The Suffolk County Legislature voted, 10 to 6, to oppose the resolution by Presiding Officer Blydenburgh supporting overriding local zoning and in favor of the Olympus project. Opposition has also been expressed by every environmental organization concerned with preserving clean water and the Special Ground Water Preservation Areas, in which L.I.D.C. is located. Mr. Ferguson is misinforming the public or simply does not know the facts.   5. The upfront payment to New York State for the first year's rent is $7,200,000, and the Parr Development Company pays $1 a year for the remainder of the 99-year lease. The $2.1 million being spent for removal of the eight buildings currently on the site has nothing to do with the rental lease, and the cost per acre of the 56.9 acres is $134,000 an acre, which is \"residential,\" not commercially priced, land. By rights, the Olympus Corporation should be paying for land on the commercially zoned Route 110 corridor, which is anywhere from $350,000 to $750,000 an acre. Once again, the taxpayers of New York State, Suffolk County and Huntington are losing money. Olympus is paying nothing for publicly owned land to be used for their private benefit.   If the Olympus Project is so perfect, would anyone explain why there is a continual drumbeat of publicity in the media by its supporters to justify their position? Could anyone tell us why so much of what they say is inaccurate?

The noble Don Pedro and his soldiers gallop toward the house of their host, Leonato. As the opening credits appear, Mr. Branagh cuts furiously between the fast-approaching soldiers (long shots of horsemen coming over the hill, close-ups of each man riding in dust and wind) and the household's preparations (women in a flurry of bathing bodies and flying clothes). Finally the two groups march toward each other in Leonato's courtyard, with the camera rising in the air to gaze down on the beautifully resolved scene. The episode captures visually all the spirit and excitement behind that single line, and sets the joyful tone of the film.    This \"Much Ado\" is a glorious version of Shakespeare, and it works not because it is Shakespearean but because it is cinematic. Mr. Branagh, who adapted the play for the screen and directed it, is faithful to Shakespeare's language and true to the raucous spirit of romance in the courtship of the determinedly unmarried Benedick (Mr. Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson).

Playing a homosexual window dresser who holds the brutalities of prison life at bay by the sheer force of his imagination, Mr. Carver gives a performance of such uncompromising truth that he qualifies, instantly and henceforth, as a star. If I were a betting man, I'd willingly put my paltry savings on him to come up a winner at Tony time.

Polly Jean Harvey's rock trio emerged from the small English town of Yeovil, recorded a magnificent debut album, \"Dry,\" for less than $5,000 and performed around England to wildly adoring audiences and rave reviews. Riding the momentum of its British buzz, the group signed to Island Records in this country and toured America. Even those wary of hype were virtually unanimous in praising Harvey's combination of serene control and primal jolt.    Her songs, about female archetypes, anger, pleasures and doubts, were taken to heart by listeners; her singing drew comparisons to every female vocalist in rock history. P. J. Harvey was on critics' best of 1992 lists across the country. But in 10 months of availability in the United States, the album sold only about 85,000 copies. The band's strong new album, \"Rid of Me,\" pushes the extremes a little farther, adding the muscularity that comes with a (slightly) bigger budget; it may already have outsold \"Dry.\" Yet I'm not expecting it to knock Whitney Houston out of the Top 10, either.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"CALLING THE BRONX -- 718 Today","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/calling-the-bronx-718-today.html","abstract":"  The Bronx joins the 718 area code this Sunday after a transition period that began July 1, 1992.

Except for the girl who is expressing herself with a gagging gesture, sticking a finger in her mouth in time with the music, everyone actually seems to want to be here in physical education class.   P.E. has changed considerably since the days when kids in baggy uniforms waited their turns to climb a rope or shoot a basket, with all but the best athletes hoping the bell would rescue them from some fresh humiliation. In recent years, schools across the country have joined a growing curriculum overhaul in physical education, replacing competitive sports with activities that prepare children for lifetime health rather than for varsity teams. Goal Is Learning, Not Scoring    Today gym teachers may give students a choice of climbing the rope, swinging on it or simply holding on. And rather than shooting at a basket once or twice during one class period, students might handle a ball hundreds of times a day, practicing repetitively with one that's the right size and weight for their skill and with a movable target that can be adjusted as their accuracy improves. Even then, the goal is not so much to learn to score a basket as to develop body awareness, hand and motion skills and the confidence to try new activities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Edmund Horman Service","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/edmund-horman-service.html","abstract":"  A memorial service for Edmund C.

Though married and more than 40 years younger than Stieglitz when she first encountered him in his Manhattan art gallery in 1927, she was drawn swiftly into his world, enthralled by his genius and powerful convictions as well as by the contemporary art he championed. Their relationship grew intimate and mutually sustaining, and lasted until his death in 1946. As pointed out in the essays by the photography critic and curator Miles Barth and the photography historian Edward Abrahams in INTIMATE VISIONS: The Photographs of Dorothy Norman (Chronicle Books, cloth, $27.50; paper, $17.95), Ms. Norman did not pursue a career as a photographer but approached photography as a private act of love and wonder. Her cityscapes, portraits, images of flowers and architecture are reproduced here in the rich tones favored by her mentor and in their original small scale. Not too surprisingly, Stieglitz is a vital presence in this elegantly designed book. He inspired her style and subjects; even his handwriting becomes part of the book's graphic design. The many portraits reveal the range of movers and shakers with whom Ms. Norman, who is now 88 years old, was acquainted -- Lewis Mumford, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Richard Wright and Elia Kazan, among others. Her pictures of Stieglitz, however, are more animated and more, in his words, wonderfully seen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Average Traffic Speed: 2.7 Miles Per Hour","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/average-traffic-speed-2.7-miles-per-hour.html","abstract":"  After a day slogging through the Garment District in a rickety truck loaded with dress suits, Jerome Miller was nearing the end of his delivery route.

At a news conference, the conductor Herbert von Karajan said, \"All else is gaslight.\" He convinced Sony, which developed the format with Philips, to build the first European CD plant in his own Austrian village, near Salzburg. The classical repertory influenced the playing time of the CD, which was designed to contain Beethoven's 70-minute Ninth Symphony. And though the aura of art camouflaged the artifice of CD sound (Luddites like myself still prefer the LP), the link with classical music helped market the new medium: High-priced CD's and players found their first buyers in the high-income classical audience.   Two new digital formats, which have received some attention in recent months, take the opposite approach. They are being presented with an emphasis on pop; only a few classical labels have shown interest. Sony has developed the mini-disk (MD) system, which uses a 2.5-inch disk for both recording and playback in a Walkman-like unit; Philips, which invented the conventional cassette, is offering a successor, the digital compact cassette (DCC).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"The Candidates on the Issues","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/race-for-governor-the-candidates-on-the-issues.html","abstract":"  On June 8, Republicans in New Jersey will select a challenger to Gov. Jim Florio in the November general election. Here is a look at the candidates by Jerry Gray of The Times's Trenton bureau. James H. Wallwork Former State Senator, 62, of Far Hills Says he would bring to government the lessons he learned as a conservative businessman.... Former owner and partner of Wallwork Brothers, Inc. of West Caldwell, N.J., a refrigeration, heating and air- conditioning wholesale distributor.... Member of the State Assembly from 1963 to 1965 and of the State Senate from 1967 to 1981.... This is his second run for the G.O.P. gubernatorial nomination. Strengths: Appeals to conservatives; has specific plans. Weaknesses: Name recognition low, late start, not enough money. Christine Todd Whitman 46, of Tewksbury. A moderate Republican who has campaigned as an outsider from Trenton politics who will shake up the old system.... This is her first race for a statewide office.... Served on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders and as president of the State Board of Public Utilities. In 1990 she almost upset Bill Bradley in a race for the United States Senate. Strength: Strong organization Weakness: Inexperience in government. Cary Edwards Former Attorney General, 48, of Oakland. A moderate Republican in the style of his former boss and political mentor, Governor Kean, Mr. Edwards has centered his campaign on the fight against crime and his experience in state government, which includes service as a State Representative and as Attorney General....Finished second in the 1989 gubernatorial primary; managed New Jersey office of the law firm of Mudge-Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon; Took a leave to run. Strengths: Experience, strong grasp of the issues. Weaknesses: Late start, vague message, low name recognition. ABORTION Each candidate supports a woman's right to choose.  Wallwork: Opposes governmental financing.  Whitman: No additional comment.  Edwards: No additional comment. TAXES All dislike the $2.8 billion tax increase that Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature. They are divided over how to dismantle it. Wallwork: Favors repealing the entire package. Proposes to do so by cutting four percent ($550 million) from the state's annual budget in his first four years in office. Whitman: Has backed off early statements that indicated she would repeal all the taxes immediately. Now says cutting the taxes will be a \"goal\" of her administration, but has not been specific about how she would do this. Edwards: Wants the Republican-controlled Legislature to immediately reduce the income tax and to make other tax changes beginning with the 1994 budget proposals now under discussion. Says he would push for an elected state auditor to help him identify waste and overstaffing in state government and would use those cuts to offset repeal of the taxes. EDUCATION Reform and financing of the state's public school system will be one of the major problems facing the Governor. Wallwork: Believes New Jersey already spends enough money on public schools but that much of it is wasted. Says he would want the public to decide through ballot referenda on programs that would allow public money to be spent to send children to private schools. Mr. Wallwork's daughter attended both public and private schools when she was growing up.  Whitman: Supports a pilot program of vouchers that would allow parents to use public funds to send their children to private or parochial schools if they desired. Mrs. Whitman's two children, a 15-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, have always attended private schools. Edwards: Proposes replacing centralized state control of education with community-designed schools for each of the state's 611 school districts to replace the centralized control by the state. Favors what he calls charter schools, which would allow each school district to tailor its curriculum. Opposes spending public funds on vouchers and other programs to send children to private or parochial schools. Mr. Edwards' youngest daughter, a 16-year-old, attends public school, as did his other daughter, who is now an adult. Each of the daughters attended at least one year of private school. CRIME The candidates all support the death penalty. Each favors boot camps for juvenile offenders. Wallwork: Would convert Fort Dix and Fort McGuire into penal institutions for juveniles and first-time offenders run by former military personnel. Says the prime way to combat crime is to create jobs. Whitman: Advocates amending state laws to permit a jury to learn about the effect of a murder on the victim's family and to consider the defendant's criminal record; increasing criminal penalties for child abuse; establishing an automobile theft prevention authority. Edwards: Proposes establishing \"Gun-Free School Zones,\" putting 4,000 more police officers on the streets, setting mandatory sentences for crimes against senior citizens and creating a firearms strike force to get illegal guns off the street.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"A Reader's Guide to the Balkans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/books/l-a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans-397993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Robert D.

There would be reason to hope that American designers could regain the sense of social mission the Aspen conference once stood for.

Holding up progress is an internal battle whose outlines were made clear last week by Ira Magaziner, a senior task force official, in remarks to a group of manufacturers. On one side are those, like Mr. Magaziner, who believe competition is the best tool for reining in health care costs while encouraging innovation. On the other side are those who believe medical costs will spiral higher until Washington slaps price controls and regulations on insurers, doctors and hospitals.

There were police officers, curious onlookers and women imploring the two to ignore the cacophony.   \"The abortion was bad enough but I felt like I was caught in the middle of a circus,\" said Melanie, an 18-year-old college student who did not want her full name used. \"Somebody yelled something like 'you can keep your baby' and all I could think was no, you don't understand.\" Prayer Vigils and Pleas    The scene described by Melanie is played out every Saturday morning in front of about 20 clinics in the New York City area as protesters try to dissuade women from going inside to undergo abortions.

In New Jersey, similar bullying failed to block a ban on semiautomatic weapons. Now Connecticut, long a gun-loving state, weighs a comparable prohibition.    The drive to impose a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles in Connecticut has gained particular momentum this year as police who feel outgunned by street criminals add their voices to the clamor for gun control. If the gun lobby loses in the Connecticut Legislature, that would palpably improve chances for passage in Washington of Federal gun controls. Such are the larger stakes as Connecticut's 36 state senators vote this week on banning the sale of semiautomatic weapons. Gov. Lowell P.

How does toothpaste for sensitive teeth work?   A.  Teeth often become sensitive when the gum recedes because of age, disease or too-vigorous brushing, Dr. Conrad A. Naleway, a researcher at the American Dental Association, wrote in Pharmacy Times, a publication for pharmacists. The newly exposed dentin is more porous than the rest of the tooth surface and opens new pathways to the nerves inside the pulp.    The resulting sensitivity to things like hot and cold may go away by itself, but some over-the-counter treatments can help. How well they work is hard to measure, and how they might act is largely speculative, Dr. Naleway said.   Chris Martin, manager of public information for the dental association, said ingredients in toothpastes recognized by the association's Council on Dental Therapeutics as effective in diminishing discomfort included potassium nitrate, strontium chloride, sodium citrate and stannous fluoride.    One respected theory of how these agents work, as described by Dr. Naleway, is that the pain is caused by movement of fluid filling the tiny tubes in the dentin that open into the pulp chamber. The fluid might either stimulate the nerves near the dentin-pulp border or stimulate the bony cells of the tooth so that they somehow simulate receptors in the pulp. Under this theory, the pain might be stopped or lessened by some means like blocking the tubules, coagulating material in them, or blocking the nerve impulse.  Cyanide Poisoning    Q.  How does cyanide kill?   A.  Cyanide kills by asphyxiating the cells of the body, said Dr. Margaret F. Dietert, associate professor of biology at Wells College in Aurora, N.Y.   Cyanide competes with oxygen in the body's cells, she said. The enzyme responsible for using oxygen has more affinity for cyanide than it does for oxygen, so the presence of cyanide starves a cell for oxygen. Cells' respiratory pathways use the oxygen in a complex process to break down glucose to produce energy for vital cell maintenance, Dr. Dietert said.   The last step adds oxygen to hydrogen to make water. If the last step does not occur, high-energy molecules of a substance called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, are not made.   Cells use the energy from ATP to maintain their semipermeable membranes, which control their chemical balance. Without maintenance, cell membranes lose their integrity and the cell eventually dies. If enough cells in the body die, toxic symptoms or death will result.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930518","headline":"Hail the Conquering Horse: Prairie Bayou Is a Star","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/18/sports/on-horse-racing-hail-the-conquering-horse-prairie-bayou-is-a-star.html","abstract":"  When he arrived at Belmont Park on Sunday to take up residence for the Belmont Stakes on June 5, he was the acknowledged star of his class, and nobody was making fun of his name or his pedigree.

The rate is lower than in previous years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930518","headline":"Death Toll From Allies In Warfare May Be 15%","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/18/science/death-toll-from-allies-in-warfare-may-be-15.html","abstract":"  UNITED STATES Army analysts have concluded from a new study of historical medical records and other evidence that some 15 percent of the casualties sustained in modern wars have been fratricidal, and that many of the Americans who would be called upon to fight a future war would again be exposed to lethal fire from their own side.   Military leaders formerly believed that the average fratricidal casualty rate in past wars was about 2 percent, although fratricidal casualties in the Persian Gulf war were known to be about 17 percent of the total. But a newly disclosed analysis by the Army's Office of the Surgeon General has caused a sensation among Pentagon planners: it appears that the \"normal\" rate of fratricidal casualties in recent American wars has been closer to 15 percent than 2 percent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19930518","headline":"Riots in Nørrebro, Copenhagen, caused by the approval of the four Danish exceptions in the Maastricht Treaty referendum.

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides, starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930518","time":"1993-05-18
