She tends to be most at home with big topics -- particularly patterns of violence in everyday life that reflect broader sociological issues -- couched in expansive, surging narratives. A short play like \"Black,\" which is being presented by Women's Projects and Productions at the Intar Theater, can't comfortably accommodate all the weighty issues she stocks it with. Unable to employ her compelling novelistic voice, she burdens her characters with thematic dialogue that sometimes suggests a blueprint for an essay in The New York Review of Books.   Set in a middle-class living room in a New Jersey town, \"Black\" traces the deterioration of a dinner party given by a white woman and her black lover for the woman's ex-husband. It is a sort of topical variation on the Walpurgisnacht of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\" in which the pretense at civility soon slips into nasty, soul-baring explosiveness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940317","headline":"Lighter Tax Burden","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/17/us/lighter-tax-burden.html","abstract":"  As states move to cut taxes, a report says 1994 may be the first year since 1985 that the burden of state levies is expected to ease.

Vladimir Chernov, the Russian baritone who has swiftly established himself as a major Verdi singer at the Met, ventured out of his accustomed territory to sing Figaro. \"Largo al factotum\" left no doubt of the rich, vibrant, rock-solid timbre of his voice and also of his considerable technical agility. But as the opera went on, he seemed to lack something in the way of collegial comic ebullience; too often he was singing admirably off on his own. There were moments when his portrayal of Figaro's self-possession ended up as mere arrogance.   Stanford Olsen initially seemed underpowered as the Count; his light tenor paled next to Mr. Chernov's powerful sound. But the refined ease of his coloratura singing combined with comic agility to produce a satisfying performance in the end. Susanne Mentzer had the measure of Rosina, although her mezzo-soprano had a dull, covered tone at the beginning of \"Una voce poco fa\" and didn't blossom out as fully as one might have wished.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940317","headline":"Regarding \"World of a Florentine Prince\" (Features, Feb. 12):: ETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/17/opinion/IHT-regarding-world-of-a-florentine-prince-features-feb-12-etters-to.html","abstract":"The otherwise thorough review of the Accademia Italiana's \"Renaissance Florence: The Age of Lorenzo de' Medici (1449-1492),\" states that, after Savonarola's execution in 1498, \"the denunciation of corruption in private morals and politics,","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940317","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/17/style/chronicle-490423.html","abstract":"  The year: 1966.

There was no delirium or disbelief. Pennsylvania's Quakers, the two-time, undefeated Ivy League champions, just continued to do what they have done all season. They made the extra pass, forced turnovers, made the right decisions and won. They just did all those things at once, on a larger, more rewarding stage.   The 11th-seeded Quakers defeated Nebraska, the Big Eight tournament champion, 90-80, in the first round of the East Regional tonight at Nassau Coliseum. They ended a 10-game Ivy League losing streak in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament and became the league's first team to advance to the second round since Princeton in 1983.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940318","headline":"At Home Abroad; A Friend Differs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/opinion/at-home-abroad-a-friend-differs.html","abstract":"  \"I think the United States has wrong-footed itself unnecessarily in its argument with Japan,\" Prime Minister Paul Keating said.   \"If it argues that Japan should open its markets to the rest of the world, having secured so much itself in the multilateral trading system, it cannot lose that argument.

Like his 1985 film, \"Hail Mary,\" this new work depicts the possible appearance of the divine in ordinary contemporary lives. But where \"Hail Mary\" outraged some Christians by reinventing one of their most sacred myths, here Mr. Godard plays it safe by reaching back to Greek mythology for his god figure. The story, he has said, is based partly on the legend in which Zeus impersonated Amphitryon in order to seduce Amphitryon's wife. In Mr. Godard's version, Amphitryon is named Simon Donnadieu (Gerard Depardieu). His wife is Rachel (Laurence Masliah) and the God who borrows Simon's body is a man in a trench coat and slouched hat, with a gravelly voice that holds the rumble of thunder behind it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940318","headline":"Fairer Schooling for Michigan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/opinion/fairer-schooling-for-michigan.html","abstract":"  This week citizens of Michigan voted courageously to toss out decades of tradition in public school financing.

Sam carries a battered copy of Freud in her backpack, is inspired by typical adolescent anger at her mother and is engaged in a search for her missing father. Part Freud and part sitcom, \"The Girl in the Watermelon\" is also deft enough to turn its hackneyed subjects into a charming, up-to-the-minute urban fairy tale. The film will be shown tonight and tomorrow as part of the New Directors/ New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.   Sam's mother, Diane, is still young and about to marry a man her daughter calls the Toad. When an outraged Sam peeks into Diane's diary from 1976, she learns that her father might not be Samuel Mayerofsky, whose photograph she worships and who died in a motorcycle accident before Sam was born. It seems there are two other paternal candidates she has never heard of. She writes to both men.

It was as if the interior of a well-known building had been reconstructed while the facade remained the same. Occasionally the results were jarring, even ludicrous; sometimes they were refreshing. The performance deserved a few of the boos it received on Wednesday, yet it also merited some of the applause.

Her art came in squares and spheres, but in also bulbous phallic shapes and chaotic linear skeins; her pieces sat on the floor, but also hung suggestively from walls and ceilings; her methods included casting, but also rather obsessive wrapping and, at certain points, a practice of shading reliefs with delicate gradations of gray and black.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940318","headline":"RUSSIAN ECONOMY HAS I.M.F.

His instinct is correct: Welfare recipients who can work should. Workfare -- tying work to welfare -- holds out the promise of producing cleaner sidewalks and safer streets cheaply. Work could also be uplifting for the poor who can't find private jobs.   But the idea of workfare has been around for as long as welfare itself. Indeed, home relief recipients are already required to look for work. But history shows that putting workfare into practice is harder than it sounds. Most of the 220,000 home relief recipients are not physically or emotionally capable of useful work. Those who are need training, transportation, child care and, above all, close supervision. A program that appears nearly without cost quickly turns expensive, which is why local governments that start workfare often slip back into simply mailing welfare checks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940319","headline":"Review/Film Festival; A Poet Tries to Live as an Informer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/movies/review-film-festival-a-poet-tries-to-live-as-an-informer.html","abstract":"  It's easy to say that the personal and political cannot be separated, especially when describing Eastern Europe during the cold war years. \"Betrayal\" gives that glib idea a sympathetic human shape.

The film is an absorbing, intellectually forceful and emotionally wrenching account of a poet's bargain with the Devil.   Though the film is set in Romania, it has less to do with the particulars of that country's politics than with the way individuals deal with repressive states. A brief prologue, set in the late 1940's, shows the poet, George Vlaicu, writing an anti-Stalin editorial that lands him in prison.

Yes, they may continue to protest her choice -- the bill doesn't impinge on their freedom of expression -- but they may not physically prevent her from exercising it.    Should they do so anyway, they will discover this bill has sharp teeth. It allows a woman whose rights have been violated to sue for monetary damages or ask a judge for an injunction against the protesters.

In recent years, no secondary opera company has struggled more with such questions of identity, and made more U-turns in its search for a direction, than the Volksoper in Vienna.
