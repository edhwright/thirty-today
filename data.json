In the greatest mass flight of people in modern times, more than a million Rwandans surged within 48 hours into neighboring Zaire. The town of Goma is now encircled by the world's largest refugee settlement, a distinction held only recently by the town of Ngara in Tanzania, where 250,000 Rwandans, most of them Hutus, fled in terror some weeks ago, fearing massacres by an advancing Tutsi-led rebel army. The total of refugees who have fled Rwanda is now estimated to be 2.1 million.   In Zaire, unlike Tanzania, few aid agencies are operating, and simply providing subsistence rations to the million Rwandans there is a colossal task. President Clinton has taken the right first step in sending Brian Atwood, the official of the American aid agency in charge of humanitarian relief, to Goma. The White House has approved 80 airlift missions and $31 million in emergency funds for food and medicine; this is in addition to $118 million in aid already airlifted to Rwanda.

Although O'Neill has obviously been New York's best hitter this year while Mattingly has not hit above .300 or driven in 100 runs since 1989, the lineup change was still dramatic because Mattingly has basically been lodged in the No. 3 spot since 1984. Mattingly, who last batted out of the third hole Aug. 11, 1992, hit second often while winning the American League most valuable player award in 1985 and has hit fourth on occasion, but he has been known and renowned for batting third.

The three-inch reel includes Lennon's performances of two songs at St. Peter's Church in Woolton, the Liverpool suburb where he lived, on July 6, 1957. It is the earliest known recording of Lennon, who was 16 at the time. The tape is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on Sept. 15. Sotheby's expects it to bring $155,000 to $230,000.   The tape was recorded on a portable Grundig TK8 (the machine is included in the sale) by Bob Molyneux, a member of the church's youth club who is now a retired policeman. In 1963, he offered the tape to Lennon, through Ringo Starr. But Lennon never responded, so Mr. Molyneux put the tape in a vault.

The weekend settlement with Microsoft -- whose MS-DOS and Windows programs dominate the market for operating systems that run personal computers -- provides a useful fix to some anticompetitive practices. But it does not take unnecessary whacks at America's premier high-tech company.   The settlement would require Microsoft to abandon several anticompetitive practices. For example, Microsoft would not be allowed to enter contracts with computer manufacturers that prevent them from doing business with Microsoft's competitors. And Microsoft could no longer charge manufacturers of personal computers according to the number of computers they manufactured -- whether or not they were loaded with Microsoft's operating system. This pricing system forced manufacturers who installed a competing operating system to pay, in effect, a second royalty.

I believe there is a third factor: renewed emphasis on the Community Reinvestment Act and the obligations it places on lending institutions to reinvest in neighborhoods from which they take deposits. The law, passed in 1977, has been criticized by neighborhood development groups because of the soft approach the bank regulatory agencies have taken to enforcement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940721","headline":"POP","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/arts/in-performance-pop-726737.html","abstract":"  Of the Beatles And Inner Battles  Bottom Line    Sam Phillips stood perfectly still, hands at her waist, staring straight ahead for most of her set on Tuesday night.

In two other upsets, Byron Black of Zimbabwe downed the No. 13 seed Henrik Holm of Sweden, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4, and No. 14 Jason Stoltenberg of Australia topped No. 3 Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 6-2, 6-2.

Kelly won in 11.36 seconds, followed by Burkett in 11.40 and Ghana's Philomina Mensha in 11.43. Before the day's action in the meet for athletes 21 and younger, the United States track and field federation told the international federation that the apparent world junior 100-meter record set on May 20 by the American sprinter Tim Montgomery would not be submitted for ratification because the track was too short. The Americans said the time of 9.96 seconds was being withdrawn because the distance Montgomery ran on the Odessa, Tex., track was measured to be four centimeters less than the proper distance. Subject to I.A.A.F. ratification, the current world junior record will now stand at 10.08 seconds, run by Obadele Thompson of Barbados in El Paso on April 16.
