The AIDS epidemic has changed that, lending every new encounter an element of danger, bringing a sense of loss to clubs that once were carefree. Seal, the English singer and songwriter who started a two-night engagement at the Beacon Theater on Monday, captures that new mood of somber revelry, a mixture of hope and mourning. His songs struggle to make peace with mortality, yearning for \"life without the pain\" and insisting that for the living, \"It's time to move on.\"   Seal, who this year released his second album, \"Seal\" (ZTT/Sire/ Warner Brothers), is on his first American tour, and his concert preserved the mystique of his video clips. Onstage, he was shrouded in smoke and darkness; he wore black until, near the end of his 90-minute set, he stripped down to a white sleeveless T-shirt, ignoring the squeals of the many young women in the audience. Seal's voice was husky and melancholy, restraining itself and staying low, revealing a soul singer's tenor range only near the end of the concert. Even when his band played dance rhythms, he moved in slow motion, striking sculptural poses with his tall, lean frame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941109","headline":"IN PERFORMANCE: DANCE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/arts/in-performance-dance-776904.html","abstract":"  From Madrid, Flamenco Put to Dramatic Effect  Lehman College    Choreographic fires blazed cheerily away in \"Cafe del Puerto,\" one of the two works Teatro de Danza Espanola presented on Sunday afternoon.

As the last stone is put in place, \"Anchoress\" creates a chilling sense of entrapment while making the young woman's sense of relief and escape clear. Now she won't have to marry the reeve, the belligerent overseer of the manor where Christine, her sister and their parents sleep in a single bed in their thatched cottage. At times \"Anchoress,\" an eccentric, beautifully photographed black-and-white film, offers an eerie immersion in a distant world.    In his first feature, the English director Chris Newby deftly carries our century's attitudes about spiritual freedom and feminism into an artfully constructed past in which such attitudes came from the Devil. The story is based on scant historical references to the real Anchoress of Shere. Two letters written on a church wall in the English countryside tell of Christine Carpenter, who escaped from the world only to long for it again. The film's Christine (Natalie Morse) is like an emotional time traveler, a bridge between our attitudes and those of the 14th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941109","headline":"Manager's Dream Is Lost In the Sun","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/sports/baseball-manager-s-dream-is-lost-in-the-sun.html","abstract":"  Mike Easler came to Puerto Rico a couple of weeks ago to nurture his managerial aspirations in this island's winter leagues much the way he had nurtured his playing career during 10 winters of play here.

Union members and women voted strongly for the Senator, and he benefited from big turnouts in the Democrats' traditional strongholds, Essex and Hudson counties, to overcome Mr. Haytaian's support in the suburbs and the vigorous campaign aid of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941109","headline":"Bronx Officer And a Man Seeking Help Are Both Shot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/nyregion/bronx-officer-and-a-man-seeking-help-are-both-shot.html","abstract":"  An off-duty New York City police officer and a man who went to him for help, saying someone was trying to kill him, were wounded yesterday by a gunman in the South Bronx, the police said.

A gap of that size -- the state's general fund budget is $34 billion this year -- could make it exceedingly difficult for Mr. Pataki to deliver the first stage of his promise to cut income tax rates by 25 percent over four years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"THE 1994 ELECTIONS: PARTIES - THE OUTLOOK: As One Party Prepares to Run the Capitol, the Other Hunts for Leaders; Republicans Get Chance on Taxes, Crime and Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-parties-outlook-one-party-prepares-run-capitol-other-hunts-for.html","abstract":"  The Republicans have left no doubt where they stand.

Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, will be the only Democratic official to hold statewide office come January. But the most powerful Democrat in Albany, when the post-Mario M. Cuomo era begins in two months, is more likely to be Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the Assembly.   Mr. Silver, the quiet veteran state legislator from Manhattan's Lower East Side, will be in a position to shape and perhaps even block much of Governor-elect George E. Pataki's agenda.   Mr. Pataki's core campaign pledge, a 25 percent reduction in the state's personal income tax rate, must go for approval to the Democratic-controlled Assembly, which Mr. Silver leads, and to the Republican-dominated Senate. The coming battles over whether to approve the tax cuts, when to impose them, how to trim state spending and how to protect local communities from a loss of vital state aid, will all inevitably find themselves right on Mr. Silver's desk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"F.A.A.

Vacco had a simple message: Let's get tough on crime, and as attorney general I'll help you get a death penalty in New York.   It was apparently a message that many voters wanted to hear.

Burstein, 50 percent to 47 percent, according to the latest results, with most of those supporting him saying in exit polls that they favored the death penalty. The margin of victory was almost the same as in the gubernatorial race, in which George E. Pataki, also a proponent of the death penalty, defeated Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who opposes it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"One Hand Tied, Clinton Offers the Other","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/the-1994-elections-states-the-president-one-hand-tied-clinton-offers-the-other.html","abstract":"  Even as President Clinton reached out to victorious Republicans, the White House was casting about today for ways to govern that would not require Congressional cooperation.

Totaled, their assets were equal to the combined gross national products of two of Brazil's largest neighbors, Peru and Bolivia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"Capitalizing On Tainted Machine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/nyregion/the-1994-elections-new-jersey-essex-county-capitalizing-on-tainted-machine.html","abstract":"  In Essex County, where the Democratic Party has often seemed as immutable a fixture as the heavens or the earth, the Republicans are not supposed to rule. But James W. Treffinger was able to capitalize on the problems of a Democratic machine that was tainted by corruption and rancorous infighting to capture the Essex County Executive's race on Tuesday.   Mr. Treffinger, 44, the Mayor of Verona, N.J., and the only Republican on the County Board of Freeholders, presented himself as a reformer who would take a machete to the county tax rate and wipe out decades of Democratic patronage in county agencies. He edged out his Democratic rival, Cardell Cooper, the Mayor of East Orange, N.J., by winning 51 percent of the vote.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"Dealers Buying Again At Impressionist Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/arts/dealers-buying-again-at-impressionist-sales.html","abstract":"  There's been a sea change in the market for Impressionist and modern art.

Pataki    Mr. Pataki, who will be New York's 53d governor, is the first Republican to be elected Governor since 1970 and the first without New York City roots since Nathan Miller of Syracuse 50 years before that. Like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki, a 49-year-old State Senator who was an Assemblyman and a Mayor of Peekskill, inherits a politically divided Legislature that could be a check on his agenda. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  Elizabeth McCaughey    If Mr. Pataki was the seasoned pol, Ms. McCaughey, who is 46 and lives in Manhattan, was the ticket's policy wonk. She was recruited from the confines of the Manhattan Institute. The Pataki campaign was short on substance, but state government revels in details. Will Ms. McCaughey be the brains behind the Pataki administration, or be left behind altogether when the guys get down to business? COMPTROLLER  H. Carl McCall    Elected by the Legislature last year to fill Edward V. Regan's unexpired term, the 58-year-old Mr. McCall survived the Republican sweep as the lone Democrat -- and the first black -- elected to statewide office in Albany. Typically, the comptroller is a naysayer, warning the Governor and Legislature not to spend what they don't have and berating them for past inefficiencies. New accounting constraints and his political independence may amplify his voice. ATTORNEY GENERAL  Dennis C. Vacco    As a former Federal prosecutor from Buffalo, he has promised to transform the office of Attorney General into a platform for changing the criminal justice system, and restoration of the death penalty has dominated his platform. But the job is considerably broader than that, and Mr. Vacco, who is 42, is largely untested as a consumer advocate and an architect of legislation within an attorney general's domain. ASSEMBLY SPEAKER  Sheldon Silver    As the Assembly Speaker, this 18-year veteran of the Legislature becomes perhaps the most powerful Democrat in the state. He is unabashedly liberal, resisting even some of Mr. Cuomo's more moderate initiatives. Moreover, as a New York City resident, representing the Lower East Side, he is likely to emerge as the city's chief defender in a state government that, presumably, will be less receptive to City Hall's legislative agenda. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER  Ralph J. Marino    The Senate majority leader, who was the chief Republican check and balance on the Cuomo administration, retains his seat, representing part of Nassau and Suffolk, and the Republicans kept their majority. But he may lose his leadership. Mr. Marino and his fellow Republican, Mr. D'Amato, are political rivals and he only grudgingly endorsed Mr. Pataki. Ambiguously, Mr. Pataki said only that he would not interfere when the Senate picks its leaders. SAM ROBERTS                    --------------------       Some Who Are Close to Governor-Elect    A representative, but incomplete, guide to those who have the ear of Gov.-elect George E. Pataki. MICHAEL FINNEGAN Former law partner, State Senate aide, campaign counsel, and old political friend. Is to Mr. Pataki what Peter J. Powers is to Rudolph W. Giuliani. UNITED STATES SENATOR ALFONSE M. D'AMATO Helped anoint Mr. Pataki with the party hierarchy, raised money and devised strategy for the campaign. In exchange, Mr. Pataki announced yesterday: \"You can call me, Al.\" CLARENCE D. RAPPLEYEA JR.  Known as \"Rapp,\" he was Mr. Pataki's mentor in the Assembly, where he is minority leader. A resident of the Southern Tier town of Norwich, the former stock car driver served as a campaign co-chairman and ambassador to upstate. JOE HOLLAND Harlem lawyer and entrepreneur who owns an ice cream parlor and founded a homeless shelter. Wanted to run for Attorney General but lost at the state Republican convention to Dennis C. Vacco, then played the good soldier by becoming co-chairman of the Pataki campaign. CHARLES GARGANO D'Amato fund raiser who helped Mr. Pataki raise $13 million, enough to outspend an incumbent Governor. LIBBY PATAKI The only Pataki adviser who the Governor-elect met while body surfing in a hurricane off Long Island. Wife and best friend since 1973. Mother of four little Patakis. Her first advice: take a vacation. He listened.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"G.O.P.'s Rising Star Pledges To Right Wrongs of the Left","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-leaders-gop-leader-gop-s-rising-star-pledges-right-wrongs-left.html","abstract":"  The former history teacher said it felt weird to be making history.

The play resulted in a fight in which safety James Washington picked up a cameraman's monopod.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941110","headline":"Who Won Where - The Races For the U.S. Senate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/the-1994-elections-congress-who-won-where-the-races-for-the-us-senate.html","abstract":"  ARIZONA Reporting: 99 %  Sam Coppersmith, D 427,285 - 40 %  #-Jon Kyl, R 577,934 - 54 % CALIFORNIA 100 %  x-Dianne Feinstein, D * 3,608,497 - 47 %  Michael Huffington, R 3,484,887 - 45 % CONNECTICUT 100 %  x-Joe Lieberman, D * 697,911 - 67 %  Jerry Labriola, R 324,405 - 31 % DELAWARE 100 %  Charles Oberly, D 84,465 - 42 %  x-William Roth Jr., R * 110,886 - 56 %  John Dierickx, Oth 3,453 - 2 % FLORIDA 99 %  Hugh Rodham, D 1,205,460 - 30 %  x-Connie Mack, R * 2,874,873 - 70 % HAWAII 100 %  x-Daniel Akaka, D * 256,189 - 72 %  Maria Hustace, R 86,320 - 24 % INDIANA 100 %  James Jontz, D 467,715 - 31 %  x-Richard Lugar, R * 1,029,421 - 67 % MAINE 99 %  Thomas Andrews, D 185,210 - 37 %  #-Olympia Snowe, R 304,516 - 60 % MARYLAND 100 %  x-Paul Sarbanes, D * 788,052 - 59 %  William Brock, R 538,326 - 41 % MASSACHUSETTS 99 %  x-Edward Kennedy, D * 1,257,945 - 58 %  W.

Last Sunday the Jets sent wide receivers Andre Reed (knee) and Don Beebe (concussion) and tight end Vince Marrow (separated shoulder) to the sidelines and battered Jim Kelly (bruised rib) several times to the turf.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"California Immigration Measure Faces Rocky Legal Path","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/us/california-immigration-measure-faces-rocky-legal-path.html","abstract":"  Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative approved decisively by California voters on Tuesday, may well turn out to be a classic case of unintended consequences.

It is 1969. A cargo plane carrying members of a jazz ensemble has been diverted to the outback for an unscheduled layover. As the villagers stare, dumbfounded, seven musicians file onto the runway and give an impromptu jazz concert. John is riveted by the sounds coming from the trumpet of the group's lead player, Billy Cross (Miles Davis). \"You seemed tuned into it,\" Billy tells the star-struck boy afterward. \"If you ever come to Paris, look me up.\"   So begins Rolf de Heers's film \"Dingo,\" a wildly romantic story about a jazz musician in pursuit of his muse. The 1991 film, which opens a two-week engagement today at Cinema Village, jumps forward two decades. John (Colin Friels), now married and the father of two girls, ekes out a living trapping the Australian wild dogs known as dingos. A largely self-taught trumpeter who has learned the instrument by studying Billy Cross records, he plays on weekends with a local \"bush band,\" whose skiffle-style rock-and-roll has nothing to do with jazz. Alone in the desert, he aims his instrument at the sky and produces lonely warbling doglike cries that echo the sounds of his idol's records, and earn him the nickname Dingo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"Ground Beef That May Be Tainted Is Recalled","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/us/ground-beef-that-may-be-tainted-is-recalled.html","abstract":"  The Department of Agriculture has announced the recall of 9,000 pounds of ground beef from Monfort Inc., a food processing firm in Greeley, Colo.

His share of the vote for governor in a four-way race was not significantly less than Lowell Weicker's winning share in a three-way race in 1990. Governor Weicker used his victory to force adoption of a personal income tax. Mr. Rowland, a Republican with the advantage of a newly elected Republican majority in the State Senate, is pledged to repeal it.    Repeal poses two threats: The tax will yield $2.7 billion this year, more than one-quarter of the $9.4 billion budget. Mr. Rowland maintains that he can offset half the revenue loss with spending cuts that will not cut services -- a dubious proposition -- and that healthier economic activity will offset the other half. Just as bad, the state would again be dependent on regressive sales taxes, and taxes on dividends and corporations that drive people and businesses away.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"Cancer Activists Boost Immune Response","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/opinion/l-cancer-activists-boost-immune-response-798711.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re your Nov. 4 news article on breast cancer as a political issue: Women with the disease will be interested to know that political activism can have a potent influence on the body's ability to control it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"2 Haitians Working for U.S. Embassy Slain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/world/2-haitians-working-for-us-embassy-slain.html","abstract":"  Two Haitian employees of the United States Embassy here were shot and killed today and a third seriously wounded in what American officials described as a payroll robbery and car hijacking.

In the last 18 months, both the Gagosian Gallery and the Yoshii Gallery have examined aspects of Giacometti's achievement in small, focused shows. Now the Acquavella Gallery is taking its turn, with an exhibition, far from small, that presents a brisk synopsis of nearly the artist's entire career.   With more than 70 works, a vast majority of them bronzes, that together span nearly five decades, this exhibition lacks the sharp focus of its predecessors (especially the Yoshii show, which presented a rare and touching view of the artist as a young sculptor). Nor is its synopsis complete: although it includes the haunting 1932 masterpiece \"Woman With Her Throat Cut,\" it passes rather lightly over the artist's Surrealist period of the late 1920's and early 30's and has nothing in plaster or wood, his frequent materials during those years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"1944: New Nazi Weapon : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/opinion/IHT-1944-new-nazi-weapon-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] A story old in this country became a new story for the world today [Nov. 10] when Prime Minister Churchill said in a speech in the House of Commons that German long-range rocket bombs - in German \"Vergeltungswaff","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941111","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/style/chronicle-798886.html","abstract":"  There are scholarships for people who study Chinese history, brain surgery, chemical engineering . . . and now, for those who want to design perfume bottles.

Some people have even wondered aloud whether this is a subject for an art museum to deal with. The answer to that question, at least, is simple. Yes, it is.

Lifting the embargo is the right policy and the fairest, surest path to an honorable and stable peace.    For years, Washington has been saying that it favors lifting the embargo.

Daniel, a year and a half into the race, has finally hit its stride.    \"Four stars?\" asks a friend one morning. It is 8 A.M., and he is calling to say thank you for the dinner we finished a mere seven hours earlier.   \"I have never had a better dinner,\" he says, dreamily recalling ethereal linguine topped with slender shavings of white truffle. \"If I concentrate,\" he adds, \"I can still smell the truffles and feel those noodles dissolving in my mouth like gossamer ribbons. What a meal!\"   \"Can't we talk later?\" I ask crossly. But he is busy remembering a veloute filled with plump caviar-topped oysters, butter-drenched leeks and sea urchin roe. The voluptuous flavors were rich and decadent, so that the hint of lemongrass in the cream soup combined with the bracing taste of caviar to deliver a gentle shock. \"It was perfect!\" my friend insists. \"Aren't you going to give them four stars?\"   \"I don't know,\" I say. \"I have to go back a few more times.\"   \"But was there anything wrong with the meal?\" he wants to know. I pull the covers over my head and think for a moment. I hope he'll hang up. No such luck.   \"They were nice to me when I walked in the door,\" he says, \"and it was abundantly clear that I was not one of their regular customers. All my clothes put together did not cost as much as one of those custom-made shirts the other men were wearing. And although neither of us had a single piece of jewelry, the hostess could not have been more welcoming.\"   \"Didn't you think the bar we waited in was awfully small and crowded?\" I ask. \"Our knees were hitting those of the people next to us. I thought it was uncomfortable.\"   \"O.K.,\" he admits, \"it was small. But they made up for it by bringing out that plate of lovely little cheese puffs.\"   \"They're called gougeres,\" I can't resist saying.   \"Whatever,\" he says. \"They were delicious. And we only had to wait seven minutes for our table. I timed it.\"   \"But didn't you think the dining room was awfully noisy?\" I persist grumpily.    He has to concede the point; the dining room was crowded, and noisier than it should have been. \"On the other hand,\" he reminds me, \"you said you thought the flowers were fabulous.\"   They were. The drama of the flower arrangements dominates the restaurant, transforming a bland beige room into a place with personality. There are no windows, but the flowers announce the seasons and set the stage for the food with designs so spectacular you find yourself rushing in the door to look at them.    \"And you liked the service,\" he prods. He is right about that, too: the service that night was smooth and sweet, more like that in a stately mansion than a large restaurant. It was formal, thoughtful and not at all stuffy. The waiter passed the amuses gueules as if he were serving at a dinner party, urging us to eat the tiny crab spring rolls and mushroom toasts while they were still hot. One day at lunch, two Brazilian runners were seated at the next table. Before they had finished their meal, the waiter had not only offered tips for tourists in New York, but also convinced them that Daniel would be the perfect place to carbo-load before the marathon; the chef, he assured them, would be happy to create some special pasta dishes.   \"Remember the nine-herb ravioli?\" my friend asks now. Who could forget it? The floppy squares of pasta were filled with a bright green puree of herbs and painted with a vivid red coulis. Colorful leaves of herbs were scattered across the top with fragrant bits of toasted pine nuts and shavings of cheese.   \"And the wild hare stew?\" he asks. At that I sit up and sniff the air. I do remember the civet de lievre. Its deep red wine sauce was thickened with blood and a touch of chocolate; it was so rich and exotic I was seduced into taking one bite and then another as I tried to chase the flavors back to their source. Served with a puree of chestnuts and the roasted loin stuffed with porcini mushrooms, the stew was a masterpiece of hearty regional cooking.    Daniel Boulud was, for 6 years, the much-acclaimed chef at Le Cirque, but in his own restaurant he is working with a new confidence. He seems to be cooking for himself with a menu that offers both hearty French food and classic cooking so technically proficient it takes your breath away.   Chilled lobster consomme is a tour de force. The soup is as clear as crystal but so expressive of lobster that if you close your eyes and take a bite you are surprised to find your mouth filled with liquid. The soup, decorated with rounds of lobster topped with creme fraiche and caviar, is dotted with coral cream when it is served. This is an astonishing dish worthy of a temple of haute cuisine. Still, if you want to continue with a less complicated course, you could order something as down-to-earth as tripes gratinees, hearty cuisine bourgeoise that would be at home in a great country bistro.    Mr. Boulud also offers a changing celebration of the seasons: daily specials that depend on little more than great ingredients. One might be the simple luxury of a large yellow potato mashed with lots of butter and fresh truffles, another an abundance of porcini sauteed in clarified butter, sprinkled with bits of rock salt and a small shower of herbs.   \"And wasn't that foie gras fantastic?\" my friend asks, reminding me of the way the unctuous liver had been balanced by the austerity of fresh quince. Fully awake at last, I begin to revel in last night's dinner as my friend and I start shouting the names of dishes, giddily recapturing a cornucopia of flavors.   \"Pumpkin soup!\" I say, recalling the bright orange puree anchored by a small mound of grated squash topped with black trumpet mushrooms, tiny bits of bacon and crunchy little pumpkin seeds.   \"Steamed skate!\" he cries, and in my mind I can see a broth the color of clover, and feel the way the corduroy texture of the fish was emphasized by the soft lobster dumplings in watercress-lobster broth.   \"Quail salad!\" I say, thinking about a lunch when I was served the most appealing salad I can remember. Leaves of mache were topped with a pair of tiny fried quail eggs and laced with velvety strips of foie gras, silky pieces of grilled quail breast and rough shavings of Parmesan cheese.   \"And the wine!\" my friend says, reminding me of the sommelier's suggestions from that list of fabulous and fabulously expensive bottles. We had settled on a '91 Chassagne-Montrachet from Colin followed by a wonderfully plummy '89 Bon Pasteur.   \"Desserts,\" my friend says now, almost reverently. Together we recite the sweets of the evening, like children recalling Halloween treats. I liked a fruit soup that looked like a reverse sunset, a mint green verbena ice-cream sun setting in a magenta wine-poached pear. He liked the gratin of chocolate, a slim disk of warm chocolate on a fragile sugar wafer. We both loved the creme brulee with macerated strawberries, and were charmed by the finale, a plate of petits fours with its fanciful pulled-sugar birds and flowers.   \"So?\" says my friend. \"Four stars?\"   \"It was a great meal,\" I concede, pushing back the covers, \"but I still have to go back and see if Daniel can sustain that level of cooking.\"   Five meals later, it is clear that the restaurant can. I have had an occasional disappointment: a salty soup, a 15-minute wait for dinner, a lost reservation at lunch. But even on an off day, the restaurant is so exciting that you wake up the morning after a meal at Daniel eager to remember every bite.   It's quite a ride.
