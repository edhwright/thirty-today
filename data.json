That was the first Green victory over a Harvard hockey team since 1981.   The Crimson's first-place finish was its sixth in the last eight seasons. The next goal will be to win the league tournament, which will culminate at Lake Placid, N.Y., on March 19 and 20.   Like Harvard, Rensselaer has clinched home ice for the early rounds of the tournament. The other two home teams will be decided this weekend in the final regular-season games among Brown, Clarkson, St. Lawrence, Vermont and Yale.   How important is home ice? ECAC home teams have won more than two-thirds of the tournament games. The event begins next Tuesday.   Brown  The Bears, largely ignored through much of the season while hovering around the .500 mark, have a six-game winning streak, the longest since the 1975-1976 Brown team won 13 in a row in a 23-7 campaign.   This surge has taken Brown past slumping Yale and into third place in the ECAC with two important contests at home ahead, against St. Lawrence on Friday and Clarkson on Saturday.   The big player for Coach Bob Gaudet's squad has been Derek Chauvette, a senior forward from West Warwick, R.I., who is seventh among ECAC scorers with 9 goals and 23 assists. His career assist total, 95, is the second-best in Brown history.   Minnesota-Duluth   Known as Duluth Normal for the first half of its 91 years, this college now has its third Western Association regular-season championship team. The other two big years for the school were in 1984 and 1985.   The McNaughton Cup, larger than the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup, is the Bulldogs' prize after they clung to first place for most of the season.   Another prize is home ice and top-seeding for the W.C.H.A. 10-team tournament, which starts March 12.   The Bulldogs have won six of their last seven games and were 15-1-0 at home. Derek Plante, the center on the first line, was the foremost player as anticipated and he leads the conference in scoring with 27 goals and 42 assists in 29 games. Plante will be the choice of many of the electors for the Hobey Baker Award as the sport's best college performer this season.   But Minnesota-Duluth has not impressed all the voters in The Albany Times Union's weekly poll. The Bulldogs (21-8-1 over all) are ranked fifth after Maine (31-1-2), Michigan (24-5-2), Miami of Ohio (24-7-3) and Boston University (24-7-2). The loss to Dartmouth dropped Harvard (19-3-2) from third to sixth this week.   ECAC Women  Providence, as expected, won the first ECAC women's tournament with a 3-0 victory over New Hampshire. Cammie Granato had the winning goal. She is from Downers Grove, Ill., and is the sister of Tony Granato, the former New York Ranger who is now with the Los Angeles Kings.   Many of the women were first brought to hockey by older brothers. \"It's a story I've heard from other women,\" said Kathy Linstad, the Northeastern coach. \"My brothers stuck me in the goal to have someone to shoot at.\"   Hockey East  There are five regular-season games to be played this week before the tournament begins March 12 at campus sites. All eight teams will participate. Maine, Boston University and New Hampshire have clinched home ice and Lowell or Providence will claim the fourth-seeded spot.   Lowell may have the best of it, meeting seventh-place Merrimack at home on Saturday after the Friars have taken on B.U. the night before at home.   Central Association  Alaska-Fairbanks, which has an impressive 21-10-2 record, will play in the C.C.H.A. tournament as an affiliate member. That will make the event a 12-team affair, and home ice will go to Miami, Michigan, Lake Superior State, Michigan State, Western Michigan and Ferris State.   Iona  The Gaels, seeded third in the ECAC North-South playoffs among Division III teams, will take on Fitchburg State tonight on their home ice, the Playland Ice Casino at Rye, N.Y.   Although its overall record was only 11-10-1, Iona won its last six league games to capture first place in the South division. A freshman, Patrick Lyons from Providence, R.I., was the Gaels' leading scorer, with 31 points in 22 games.   Middlebury (18-3-2) is seeded first in the ECAC East eight-team tournament, which began last night. Middlebury was followed by Babson (17-5-1), Connecticut (18-5-2) and Williams (17-6-0). Semifinals are Friday and the championship game comes Saturday at a site to be determined.   Plattsburgh State  The Cardinals will play host to Cortland State, a team they have beaten twice this season, in the championship game Saturday of the SUNY tournament.    Cortland defeated Fredonia to reach the final, and Plattsburgh crushed Oswego by a combined score of 17-7 in two games as Lenny Pereira stretched his scoring streak to 23 games.   Plattsburgh now awaits the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III tournament, while Elmira plays host to the ECAC West tourney Friday and Saturday. The Soaring Eagles (21-5-0) will play Hobart (14-11-0), and Canisius (17-10-1) will meet Mercyhurst (18-7-0).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930303","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/sports/transactions-972593.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League  MILWAUKEE BREWERS -- Agreed to terms with Doug Henry, pitcher, on a one-year contract.

Bharatiya Janata is a democratically functioning party wedded to ideals of democracy, equality, free enterprise and uniform civil and social laws for all people and regions of the country. The party simply desires to right the wrongs perpetrated by disastrous policies and programs of prolonged one-party rule in India.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930303","headline":"Dublin Journal; On the Kingmaker's Agenda, Ulster Looms Large","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/world/dublin-journal-on-the-kingmaker-s-agenda-ulster-looms-large.html","abstract":"  In the mid-1970's, when Dick Spring was tending bar at the Mad Hatter on Second Avenue in Manhattan, he was just another Irish visitor, better known on the Upper East Side than in Dublin.

Inflated public contracts awarded in exchange for kickbacks have cost Italy's taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. The scale of wrongdoing has outraged even the famously cynical Italian public, feeding demands for fundamental changes in the cozy arrangements by which Italy has been run for more than four decades.    Those changes could begin as soon as next month, when a referendum will be held on changing the proportional representation system for parliamentary elections. The idea is to encourage something like alternating two-party government in place of the permanent coalition rule that has virtually invited financial backscratching.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930303","headline":"Starks Is Fined But Isn't Banned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/sports/pro-basketball-starks-is-fined-but-isn-t-banned.html","abstract":"  John Starks of the Knicks was fined $5,000 by the National Basketball Association yesterday, but he was not suspended for his flagrant foul against Kenny Anderson of the Nets.

Stunt programming during a sweeps period -- when ratings that determine advertising rates are measured -- isn't limited to the commercial networks. Public television and cable are not just passive bystanders. They, too, haul out their biggest guns and, more often than not, that means big names. Tonight alone offers \"Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall,\" on Channel 13 at 8 in New York and at 8:30 on PBS; \"Larry King Extra: A Very Special Conversation With Elizabeth Taylor,\" on TNT at 8, and \"Maestro Between Two Worlds: Kurt Masur,\" on Channel 31 at 9.    Taped in June before the kind of adoring audience attracted to any Stephen Sondheim event, the Carnegie Hall occasion is not as consistently electrifying as the 1986 \"Follies in Concert\" classic at Lincoln Center. This time, an effort has been made to include some of the composer's lesser-known works, numbers from the stage musical \"Assassins\" and the film \"Dick Tracy.\" That effort is not always justified.    But when Mr. Sondheim is good, he is brilliant. And there are enough stars on hand to make some of his more familiar songs soar: Bernadette Peters with \"Not a Day Goes By,\" Patti LuPone with \"Being Alive,\" Dorothy Loudon with a medley of \"Losing My Mind\" and \"You Could Drive a Person Crazy.\" Glenn Close's dramatic reading of \"Send In the Clowns\" comes off far more effectively in television close-up than from a seat in the middle of Carnegie Hall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930303","headline":"Campus Journal; For a Black Woman, Space Isn't the Final Frontier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/03/education/campus-journal-for-a-black-woman-space-isn-t-the-final-frontier.html","abstract":"  As the first black woman to venture into outer space, Dr. Mae C.

Byrd's wonderful playfulness and his utter confidence in the juggling of complex burdens are qualities still close to the hearts of early-music groups like the New York Consort of Viols, and also of audiences like the one that gathered at St. Ignatius Loyola Church, on Park Avenue at 84th Street, to hear some of his music last Thursday evening. Concert life, musical training and listener expectations have changed so drastically that Byrd will remain a far-off figure for most.   He was a prolific parent of the English Tudor school, and Thursday's concert was an attempt to wrap a very few arms around a large body of music. Louis Bagger played a number of harpsichord pieces. \"Walsingham\" showed an elaborate variational style.

Stravinsky's ballet music, known now as a concert piece, is no less an amalgam of musical terrorism and natural cataclysm than it was at its first performances in Paris. Indeed, listening to the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under James Levine play it at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon was to be stunned all over again.   Music has not been the same since \"Le Sacre.\" Its legitimization of violent expression and its violations of regular metric movement opened avenues for younger composers, but Stravinsky's piece created no school of followers: nothing, for instance, that approached Schoenberg's influence on a generation of Serialists or Chopin's on the piano writing that came after him. \"Le Sacre\" stands by itself.

They just couldn't agree on how much more. And since as a two-year player, Gonzalez wasn't eligible for arbitration until after this season, it was the Rangers who had the ultimate leverage. Yesterday they used it. After failing to win agreement on a multiyear contract or even an interim one-year deal, the team unilaterally renewed Gonzalez's contract for one year at what team officials described as \"a very substantial raise,\" presumably closer to the $500,000 the club had offered than the $850,000 Gonzalez had sought. Two other players not eligible for arbitration -- catcher Ivan Rodriguez, the American League Gold Glove winner, and third baseman Dean Palmer -- also rejected multiyear pacts but came to terms on new one-year agreements.   Kansas City Royals   In 10 years in the big leagues he had never had surgery, but yesterday Mike Boddicker underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and was expected to miss two to four weeks. A minor cartilage tear was repaired and cartilage under the knee cap was shaved, the Royals' team physician, Steve Joyce, said. Doctors had not expected to have to shave the cartilage, and Boddicker will be out longer than had been thought. The 35-year-old right-hander, 1-4 with a 4.98 earned run average and three saves in 1992, will be paid $3 million this season, the final year of a three-year contract.   Chicago White Sox   A disgruntled Carlton Fisk reported to camp, still stuck with a minor league contract, albeit one fashioned in an unprecedented way. The 45-year-old catcher, the White Sox's career leader in home runs, signed a contract yesterday that had to be drawn up by management's Player Relations Committee in order to include language that Fisk, a 21-year major leaguer, had insisted upon, including a guarantee barring an assignment to Class AAA Nashville. Fisk will be guaranteed $650,000. If the catcher is cut, he will be paid $800,000. If he should play 50 games, his salary would reach $900,000; 90 games would guarantee $1.1 million.   Montreal Expos   Outfielder Moises Alou, who staged a two-hour protest by holding out at the start of spring training, had his 1993 contract renewed yesterday by the Expos, ending an exhausting round of negotiations. Alou, runner-up in National League rookie of the year voting last season, refused to sign for the club's last offer of $210,000, so he was renewed at what he and his agent predicted would be a smaller figure, possibly $200,000.   An impasse centered on the club's belief that Alou receive a split contract, meaning he would be paid a smaller salary if he were sent to the minors. But the club relented and gave him a one-way deal.   Alou followed through on a threat to boycott the start of spring training Feb. 27, holding out for two hours. He then joined workouts after being coaxed by his father, Expos Manager Felipe Alou.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"U.N.

Booker T. Laury, from Memphis, and Henry Townsend, from St. Louis, have been professionals since the 1930's; they are individualists who have stayed that way. Playing solo, they haven't smoothed out individual rhythmic quirks to fit in with bands. And since they have largely been ignored by recording companies -- Mr. Townsend made \"Mule\" for Nighthawk Records in 1980, which has been rereleased as a CD -- they haven't been pressured to update their music. Both bluesmen sound increasingly wayward, startling and irreplaceable.   The 83-year-old Mr. Townsend sang epic-length blues, many stretching far beyond 10 verses, that presented a landscape of unending desolation and betrayal. He sings in a weary, plaintive tenor, with quavers and slides that make remembered pain sound immediate.

Sometimes Mr. Roberts will reharmonize a melody, using spare triads at first and fat and lush chords the next. Or he'll arpeggiate through a piece, following the harmonies; standard practice, but with his ability to convey clarity, the most obvious movements become profound, their significance underscored. He lets his hands mark out contrasting rhythms that threaten to tear a piece apart, and he freely varies a tune's tempo. Mr. Roberts has dedicated himself to learning not only the jazz tradition but also the lilting music of the 19th century, and he brings an astonishing richness to his playing.   Above all, he is gaining a rare intellectual rigor; everything he plays seems to have been examined for the meaning it imparts. He opened his first set on Tuesday at the Village Vanguard (178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street), where he will play through the rest of the week, with a series of piano solos that ranged from material by Scott Joplin and Jelly Roll Morton through a standard -- \"Embraceable You\" -- and Duke Ellington's \"Mood Indigo.\" Each piece rambled through all sorts of different harmonies and styles, but where most players take the simplist interpretive routes, usually adding anachronistic modern flourishes to older material, Mr. Roberts has pared the harmonies, adding momentary dissonances like flashes or letting hammered notes resonate quietly. He's an eccentric, without any of the primitivism that eccentricity so often implies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"Iran Reported to Arrest 47,000 Drug Addicts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/world/iran-reported-to-arrest-47000-drug-addicts.html","abstract":"  An estimated 60 tons of illegal drugs have been confiscated and 47,000 addicts arrested since last March in Iran's long-running battle against drug use and trafficking, a Teheran daily reported today.

But that group returned the permit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"The Mohair Toilet Seat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/opinion/the-mohair-toilet-seat.html","abstract":"  Washington's subsidy for ranchers who produce wool and mohair exceeds $100 million a year.

After missing nearly two months to undergo radiation treatments for this form of cancer, Lemieux returned to action Tuesday night in Philadelphia and will play his second straight game when he meets the Rangers tonight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/style/IHT-the-movie-guide.html","abstract":"International Herald Tribune.

Seattle is bound to lose its magnetic pull eventually, and people will once again consider it simply the home of airplanes and rain. Then it will be Portland's moment to dazzle the masses. Cheaper rents and less hype, but proximity to the alternative-rock boomtown, make the City of Roses an ideal cultivating ground for challenging, smart new rock. One of Portland's best offerings so far is Pond. The group, which has released a debut album on Nirvana's former label, Sub/Pop, has a sound all its own, based in melodic mutterings and angry psychedelic zoom. Pond appears Saturday night in the middle of a bill warmed up by Coffee and headlined by Buffalo Tom. The late show is sold out, so get your tickets now for the 7:30 P.M. performance. Tickets are $8, available at See Hear in Manhattan, (212) 505-9781; Pier Platters in Hoboken, (201) 795-9015, or through Ticketmaster. Female Power     Kristin Hersh, She Never Blinks and Cindy Lee Berryhill, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. The power of woman is unleashed in two separate shows on Saturday at this favorite downtown spot. Kristin Hersh, leader of the trailblazing avant-rock group Throwing Muses, sings and plays her harrowing, gorgeous music in a solo performance; She Never Blinks opens. That show begins at 9 P.M. Taking the stage at 11 is Cindy Lee Berryhill, reclaiming her title as the Dorothy Parker of folk with a set of her dry-as-ice, bittersweet compositions. Each show is $10 and tickets are available at the Knitting Factory or through Ticketmaster. Sweet, Sharp and Blue     Son Seals, Tramp's, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. Son Seals plays blues that can be as bitter as the Chicago wind, but when they're sweet they're like creme brulee, dark and sharp on the surface, but with an inside that's rich with sugar. Mr. Seals remains among the best guitarists to carry the torch from such players as Muddy Waters, paying attention to rock without abandoning the basic 12-bar tradition. His music communicates the harsh realities of black urban life in terms that make as much sense today as they did when the blues were young. This show's a real bargain, especially since Lucky Peterson is opening on Friday and the Bennett Brothers share the bill on Saturday. Sets begin at 8:30 and 11:30 each night, and tickets are available at Tramp's or through Ticketmaster.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Trade's New Sheriff","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/trade-s-new-sheriff.html","abstract":"  Both Clintons were on view last week.

(Who could forget \"The Great Age of Japanese Buddhist Sculpture\" in 1982?) But its recent track record has been somewhat spotty. It reached a low point a few years ago with an exhibition of Ansel Adams photographs from a Japanese private collection, an unfathomable choice for a New York audience with exceedingly long exposure to this photographer's work.   By contrast, \"Visions of the Dharma: Japanese Buddhist Paintings and Prints in the Honolulu Academy of Arts\" brings the society back up to speed. The work is extremely beautiful and is unfamiliar locally; much of it is being published for the first time in the good-looking catalogue written by the Honolulu Academy's curator of Asian art, Stephen Little, that accompanies the show. The catalogue's contention that the academy has one of the \"finest groupings of Japanese Buddhist paintings and prints in the United States\" may be a bit inflated; with collections in Boston, Cleveland, San Francisco and Washington on the list, the competition is fairly stiff.

For several years the pianist and singer Daryl Scherman has been developing an enviable polish as a performer with a repertory of rarely heard songs, chosen perceptively from the pop output of the last 70 years. She has done this in solo situations, in a duo with the bassist Boots Maleson and in a trio with the guitarist James Chirillo. This weekend her group has become a quartet with the addition of the saxophonist Morris Goldberg, a white native of South Africa who came to the United States 30 years ago and has spent much of his career here playing with black South Africans like Hugh Masakela and Abdullah Ibrahim as well as with American musicians. The result is an unusual mixture of sources and styles. The group plays tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30, and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. There is a music charge of $15 tonight and tomorrow, but no minimum at any show. In Great Footsteps     Ruth Brown, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. As great singers like Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington have passed from the music scene, one of the singers following most capably in their tradition is Ruth Brown. She might have been just a rhythm-and-blues belter, which was the way she started out in the 1950's, but she added to this the jazz inspiration she received from Holiday, Vaughan and Washington. In fact, her program at Fat Tuesday's includes many jazz standards, which she will record for an album when her engagement ends. Backed by a group led by the guitarist Rodney Jones, she will sing tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $27.50 music charge and a $10 minimum. Cabaret and Jazz     Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, J's, 2581 Broadway, north of 97th Street, (212) 666-3600. A year ago, when the Manhattan Association of Caberets and Clubs had firmly established March as Cabaret Month, J's brought another flavor to the celebration with friendly programs called \"Cabaret Meets Jazz.\" The two elements are joining forces again on Sundays this year, starting this weekend when a pair of rising cabaret singers, Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, share the evening and the backing of a jazz trio led by the pianist Billy Charlap with Sean Smith on bass and Tim Horner at the drums. Miss Caplan came to attention Off Broadway in \"Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding\" and Mr. Porter was the 1992 \"Star Search\" winner. Miss Caplan goes on at 8:30 P.M. and Mr. Porter at 10; at 11:30 Mr. Charlap's trio has the stage to itself.

Sleekly red, it is also hugely cute, because its skewed proportions and simplified details are those of a child's toy that has been blown up to adult real-life scale. Enjoy it. There's not a lot of eyes-on pleasure to be had inside, where the latest Biennial turns its back on the razzle-dazzle of the 1980's and faces the harsher realities of the 90's.    The first Biennial to be completely organized during the tenure of David A. Ross, the museum's director, the '93 version is a pious, often arid show that frequently substitutes didactic moralizing for genuine visual communication. It could easily be subtitled \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" It could also be called the Reading While Standing Up Biennial: the art is often heavy with text, even without the simplistic artists' statements featured on many labels and the reading room, where one can peruse the latest books of cultural and sociopolitical theory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Restaurants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/arts/restaurants-164093.html","abstract":"  In the final analysis, it could be argued that consistency, more than dazzle, is the touchstone of a good restaurant. Many establishments open with a clear concept and noble intentions, and some even reach their goals.

Andiamo, a jazzy Italian restaurant in a theatrical space near Lincoln Center, has been grappling with that problem for several years. It got off to a high-kicking start in 1988 under a talented and versatile chef, Frank Crispo. As is often the case, just as the restaurant had established an enthusiastic clientele, the chef moved on. Two successors failed to rekindle the excitement, and Andiamo was reduced to a gastronomic understudy in this competitive neighborhood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"More Reports of Suffering","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-more-reports-of-suffering.html","abstract":"  Unconfirmed accounts of violence, hunger, lack of shelter and the complete absence of medicines and bandages in the Cerska enclave continued to emerge through reports from radio operators broadcasting from the besieged area.    \"We've lost all faith in negotiations, agreements and promises,\" said Senaid Babic, the main radio operator. \"The situation continues as before with nonstop shelling from all directions.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Some War-Weary Serbs Ask U.S. and Russia to Impose Peace","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-some-war-weary-serbs-ask-us-and-russia-to-impose-peace.html","abstract":"  The airdrops of relief supplies into Bosnia and Herzegovina by the United States and the offer of similar help by Russia have been welcomed by many Serbs, who see such cooperation within the United Nations as the only hope of ending the Balkan war.

We have sliced up the octave into 12 equal parts, leaving every note just a little out of tune.

This time around city officials appear to be taking a more conciliatory approach. They are reaching out more to the businesses, known as sex clubs, and seeking their cooperation in monitoring themselves rather than forcing further closings. They say the clubs, which offer patrons anonymous sex with multiple partners, can actually help reduce the spread of the virus if their patrons can be steered to practice safer sex. Emphasis on Monitoring    The resurgence of commercial sex establishments, catering to both homosexuals and heterosexuals, in New York and other cities is at odds with signs that many people are growing more conservative in their sexual practices because they fear AIDS. Public health officials in New York City say several factors may be at play -- denial of the H.I.V. risk, a sense of immortality among younger generations, sexual preferences that are difficult to modify, and even a sense of fatalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"How Do You Fight the Mob? Get a Lawyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/books/books-of-the-times-how-do-you-fight-the-mob-get-a-lawyer.html","abstract":"Little Ricky wants to run home, but Mark, being older and more street wise, knows what he must do. He crawls to the rear of the car, removes the hose from the exhaust and sneaks back to the bushes. After a few minutes, the man climbs out again, weeping and mumbling and holding a bottle of whisky, reattaches the hose and climbs back into the car. Ricky begins to cry and to plead with his brother to take him home, but Mark pulls the hose loose again. This bizarre ritual continues until the man catches Mark and drags him into the car to die beside him.   Inside, the man threatens Mark with a gun and drunkenly explains why he's committing suicide. He's a lawyer who does work for the mob, and one of his clients, Barry (the Blade) Muldanno, has murdered a United States Senator. Nobody can find the body to use as evidence, but the suicidal lawyer has just learned that Barry hid it under the floor of the lawyer's garage. Besides Barry the Blade, he's the only one who knows, so his life is worthless.   While the lawyer is telling Mark all this and getting steadily drunker, Ricky removes the hose. Mark then escapes from the car and hides in the bushes again. The lawyer climbs out of the car once more, sees the detached hose and shoots himself in the head. The boys run home. Ricky goes into traumatic shock and has to be hospitalized. Both the police and Barry the Blade begin to suspect what the lawyer told Mark just before he died. They begin to press the boy to tell.   But what is most astonishing about this opening, which takes all of 20 pages, is how little Mr. Grisham does with it in the next 400 pages. \"The Client\" brings new force to the word anticlimax. It is as if at the outset the narrator had announced that he was about to conduct us on a journey across a desert with a cactus and a rock in it to a mountain range beyond, and that several surprises were in store. The surprises turn out to be that the cactus is a cactus, the rock is a rock and the mountain range is a mountain range. Once again, as he did in \"The Firm,\" Mr. Grisham enraptures us with a story that has hardly any point.   What's most irritating is how deeply the plot hooks us. Mark Sway is \"a tough little kid, raised on the streets and wise beyond his years,\" as another character gratuitously informs us. Instead of letting himself be pushed around, Mark goes out and hires himself a lawyer, a woman who calls herself Reggie Love, and he tells her what he's feeling: \"I'm really sick of this. Just sick of it. All my buddies are in school today, having a good time, being normal, fighting with girls during recess, playing jokes on the teachers, you know, the usual stuff. And look at me. Running around town with my lawyer, reading about my adventures in the newspapers, looking at my face on the front page, hiding from reporters, dodging killers with switch-blades. It's like something out of a movie. A bad movie. I'm just sick of it. I don't know if I can take anymore.

It was presented by the Feld Ballets/NY on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater.    Tethering was, in a sense, the raison d'etre of Mr. Feld's new \"Frets and Women.\" The ballet, set to music by Lou Harrison that tended to be repetitive and self-limiting, is a ritualistic dance for a group of nine women, with solos for three of them. The women are dressed in gray sheaths that cover their body from shoulders to toe, but leave one leg bare. The piece makes much, toward its end, of the fact that one of the women is dressed in a white stretch sheath that covers all but her face, summoning inevitable recollections of early Martha Graham costumes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Spreading A.A.
