It may not be the Rosebud sled from \"Citizen Kane,\" but the suit does count as one of the more memorable cinematic encounters between unbridled American vulgarity and British restraint, with Ms. Rudner playing a willful Hollywood actress forced to spend a weekend at an English country house with her husband, played by Kenneth Branagh, and five of his old classmates from Cambridge.    None of the group, summoned by the Peter of the film's title, know quite what to make of the creature that their old friend has brought into their midst.

There were times when William Black achieved that effect on Tuesday evening when he played works by Bach, Poulenc, Griffes and Schumann at Alice Tully Hall. Yet as counterweights to those transcendent moments, others seemed oddly distant and flat, as if the pianist had spent so much effort conceptualizing the music's structure and contours that he lost sight of its color and depth.   Mr. Black's power of illusion was at its strongest in Poulenc's Nocturnes, eight gracefully descriptive character sketches composed between 1929 and 1938 and not played as frequently as they deserve to be. Mr. Black captured the spirit of each unfailingly and made their extramusical qualities -- a slight impetuousness in the first, mischievousness in the fifth, stateliness in the last -- seem vivid and tangible. In technical terms, too, he was entirely on target. He produced a sound that had a gentle haze, yet the music's textures were clean and unambiguous.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930114","headline":"Met Museum Election","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/arts/met-museum-election.html","abstract":"  Annette de la Renta has been elected a vice chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The measured strikes by the U.S., France and Britain at air defense targets in southern Iraq should have been no surprise to anyone, least of all Saddam Hussein.   It would be surprising, however, if the attacks achieved the stated goal of persuading Saddam Hussein to stop attempting to undermine the territorial and military terms imposed by the victors in the Persian Gulf war. For him, the benefits of showing the Arab world he can still thumb his nose at the West outweigh the costs of losing a few radar and missile sites.   Soon -- within a few months, at best -- Mr. Hussein will resume his nibbling. Then the allies, including the new team in Washington, will respond, as they must, with air strikes against targets that he values more. Those responses are unlikely to be decisive, and the round of move and countermove will continue.    Saddam Hussein and the coalition are locked in a ritual dance from which there is no easy exit. The coalition will thus pay a price for failing to press the 1991 war to the point of toppling him. But at that time carrying the ground war into Baghdad's streets seemed likely to cost too many coalition and Iraqi lives and to be unnecessary. Surely, it was assumed, the Iraqi armed forces, with critical help from Washington, would purge the leader who had brought them so catastrophic a defeat. That calculation did not reckon with Mr. Hussein's ability to coerce continued loyalty from an inner circle ruthless enough to suppress opposition.    The means of persuasion at the coalition's disposal today are far fewer than they were two years ago. Renewing the ground war is not among them. Nor need it be: the available instruments are sufficient to get two clear messages across.    The first message is for the Iraqi military establishment. Deprived of modern air defenses, its forces are acutely vulnerable to air attack. It should understand that the strikes will continue, and be more and more costly, until the nibbling stops.    The second message is the same, but it is for the Iraqi people. The coalition will not attack them directly. Nor does it want to attack military targets in their midst. But the Iraqis should realize that the comfortable life they enjoyed before 1990 will be impossible so long as Saddam Hussein continues his provocations. That means maintaining the blockade, at least to the point where only essential medical supplies and foods can enter Iraq. It means continuing the embargo on oil sales and thus denying Iraq the money needed to import anything of value. For middle- and upper-class Iraqis, it means no travel abroad.   Such responses should lead the Iraqi military and people to realize that time is not on Saddam Hussein's side. Obviously, the coalition cannot stop all embargo- and blockade-busting. But sufficient pressure can be maintained for a very long time, particularly if substantial oil sales are prevented.    Iraqis must realize that Mr. Hussein has reduced Iraq to the status of marginal actor in the Middle East; by continuing to exert steady military, political and economic pressure, the coalition can insure that it will remain one. Mr. Hussein's posturing in the prison he has made of his country should not prevent the Clinton Administration and its allies from focusing on the issue that will most affect the Middle East's future stability: the continuing effort to bring about peace between Israel and its neighbors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/nyregion/c-corrections-307493.html","abstract":"  An article on Jan. 2 about race relations in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx misidentified a Hispanic resident whose business is next to others run by blacks and whites.

Neilson, who lost his job as Rangers' head coach 12 days ago, often did things like that. He had a room full of players who believed they should be playing, and he let those who would not learn the news from a lineup posted on the locker room wall -- sometimes after the morning skate on game days. In Richter, he had a goalie who plays brilliantly when confident and erratically when not, and he responded to Richter's on-ice difficulties with confidence-killers. He banished him to the stands in favor of Hirsch (who never played a minute) and failed to talk to him for days.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"Hockey; The Party's Over: One Strong Period and Then Pffffft!","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/sports/hockey-the-party-s-over-one-strong-period-and-then-pffffft.html","abstract":"  It was back to ground zero for the Islanders tonight at Nassau Coliseum as they were shut out, 3-0, by the Washington Capitals, whose veteran goaltender, Don Beaupre, turned impenetrable for the first time since 1991.

The trade deficit, after declining temporarily, is almost at record levels -- nearly $50 billion in 1992. With Japan in the midst of one of its steepest economic declines in years, the chances for a boost in imports of American goods this year are virtually nil.

They said the increase in tobacco taxes, which would generate an estimated $180 million, would be the largest source of new revenue in the budget that the Governor is to propose on Tuesday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-90505104420.html","abstract":"'Dangerous' Germans?

The extension gave Reed both financial and job security, which a person close to the situation who requested anonymity estimated to be worth about $300,000 a year. Reed's title is now executive vice president/basketball and general manager, and the promotion includes other responsibilities besides those involving basketball. The Nets hope to use Reed's outgoing personality -- as well as his Hall of Fame credentials -- to expand his duties into the community affairs and marketing areas of the franchise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"'Dangerous' Germans?

Tragically, he was able to complete only one full operatic setting of a Shakespeare play: \"Beatrice and Benedict,\" his final work. This refined adaptation of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" is the most workable of the Berlioz operas, but it is still difficult to bring off smoothly; the American premiere was only 33 years ago.   On Wednesday night the Boston Lyric Opera presented a new production of \"Beatrice,\" created by Colin Graham, in which the Shakespearean element is expanded even beyond Berlioz's intentions. Mr. Graham, working in conjunction with the set and costume designer John Conklin (also his partner for \"The Ghosts of Versailles\"), has entirely revised the libretto, inserting direct excerpts from \"Much Ado\" in place of Berlioz's own dialogue. The performance, while not completely successful, continues the Lyric Opera's revival of opera in Boston, taking the place of Sarah Caldwell's moribund Opera Company of Boston. With recent productions of Blitzstein's \"Regina\" and of \"Ariadne auf Naxos,\" this small company has established itself as a fresh and intriguing presence on the operatic scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"THE NEW PRESIDENCY: New Haven Journal; Illegal Help?

Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.   Bill Clinton is in effect the first \"post-Communist\" American President, who will deal with Russia and the other former Soviet republics as independent states from the outset of his Administration.   The prospect has caused some apprehension in Moscow. In the Bush Administration, Russia enjoyed a distinct primacy among other former republics and was treated as the successor to the Soviet Union in arms controls and other areas. It was evidently for this reason that President Boris N. Yeltsin pushed to sign the latest strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start II, while Mr. Bush was still in charge. Mr. Yeltsin has also asked for a quick meeting with the new President to maintain that special relationship.

But it seemed as if the entire cast, supported by James Levine's supple conducting, was attentive to his esthetic lessons. There were beautifully structured arias but also exquisite nuances; freedom accompanied law. One was tempted to paraphrase Sachs's acclaim for Walther: this came close to being a Masterscene.   There were many highlights throughout the performance, but that scene -- with its final quintet -- was the heart of this impressive, uncut \"Meistersinger.\" Otto Schenk has again made a case for traditionally staged Wagner at the Met, following the composer's detailed directions. In this case, the literalness made still more sense because Wagner violated his own principles for musical drama and used a realistic subject, not a mythical one, basing his story on the song contests once held by German guilds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930116","headline":"Observer; Must Be Democrats","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/16/opinion/observer-must-be-democrats.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration looks ready to hit the ground stumbling.
