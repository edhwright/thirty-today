That is the emphatic if impressionistic judgment about the nightly katydid chorus this August, ventured by a dozen householders and nature-watchers from Georgia to Connecticut. The weather is the cause: a punishing winter, a cool spring and a wet summer, an ideal combination for insect eggs and larvae, and bad for the predators and soil fungi that kill them. Hence what Dr. Louis Sorkin, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History, calls \"higher than average species populations\" for everything from crickets to mosquitoes.   From there, it all depends on one's perspective. Consider the grasshopper, which is said to cause $80 billion in crop damage every year, whose five-to-seven-year cycle is now peaking. Farmers around Washington D.C. contend that the green creatures have munched away whole fields of alfalfa and soybeans; backyard gardeners in Virginia report that \"gourmet grasshoppers\" are cleaning out beds of basil, sage and mint. It is small solace for victims to be reminded by agronomists that grasshopper guano is excellent fertilizer for next year's crops.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940824","time":"1994-08-24

Our ambivalence about these Arab leaders is becoming a major obstacle in managing the transition from war to peace -- especially the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and efforts to produce a Syrian-Israeli peace, which would transform the region.   Yasir Arafat makes all the decisions for the new Palestinian authority. This frustrates many Palestinians, the Israelis and virtually all foreigners and world economic institutions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940825","headline":"The So-Called World Of an Adolescent Girl, As Interpreted by One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/arts/television-review-so-called-world-adolescent-girl-interpreted-one.html","abstract":"  The built-in obstacle for a dramatic series about teen-age life that aims to engage an adult audience has to do with its level of sophistication. It needs to be authentic enough that, on the one hand, it's persuasive and maybe even instructive about the angst and perplexity and exhilaration of the adolescent Zeitgeist. On the other hand, you don't want it to be too authentic. That would be stultifying (or terrifying), like living with your neighbors' kids. Where's the entertainment in that?   \"My So-Called Life,\" the much-ballyhooed new series that has its premiere tonight on ABC, bravely takes on this problem, and even adds a degree of difficulty. The stories are ostensibly told from the point of view of the main character, a 15-year-old girl named Angela Chase; much of the action is accompanied by her voice-over narration, literally making the show's narrative voice her own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940825","headline":"Scene Surrounding American Pastime Takes On an International Flair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/sports/baseball-scene-surrounding-american-pastime-takes-on-an-international-flair.html","abstract":"  It was probably as appropriate as it was inevitable that the talks aimed at resolving a parochial dispute between multimillionaires involving the American national pastime would be held in a distinctly cosmopolitan setting in a moneyed New York neighborhood at a Japanese-owned hotel flying the American and Swedish flags.   \"The Swedish ambassador stays here,\" explained John Crowley, the 68-year-old Irish-born doorman on duty at the East 48th Street entrance to the Hotel Inter-Continental, site of yesterday's resumed baseball talks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940825","headline":"U.S. Humanities Endowment Makes Grants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/arts/us-humanities-endowment-makes-grants.html","abstract":"  The National Endowment for the Humanities has announced 307 grants, totaling $29.7 million, for the third quarter of 1994.

New regulations reflecting President Clinton's order restricting money transfers and charter flights to Cuba were supposed to be published today by the Treasury Department's Foreign Assets Control Office. But Administration officials said this evening that the publication of the rules would be delayed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940825","headline":"S.
