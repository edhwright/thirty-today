Mr. Braxton, who plays a handful of reed instruments, used a pure sound to spread gorgeous melodies over the music. Mr. Teitelbaum worked with a keyboard synthesizer, sampler and an interactive computer to produce all sorts of counterpoint, from noise to the reproduction of other musical instruments. The gentleness of it all, which never sank into a New Age sogginess, gave the music its identity.   The two opened with an improvised piece that had Mr. Braxton moving from instrument to instrument; his solos on alto saxophone shuffled along, jamming notes in a rigid pattern. Mr. Teitelbaum had his machines follow Mr. Braxton, harmonizing his lines or offering an almost symphonic background. The distortion of a rock guitar showed up for a minute only to sail away into a dreamy section that sounded as if it was produced by a synthesizer. And Mr. Teitelbaum mimicked the sound of bells, as if the wind was quietly ringing a set of chimes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940502","headline":"Rains and Disease Ravage Refugees Fleeing Rwanda","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/02/world/rains-and-disease-ravage-refugees-fleeing-rwanda.html","abstract":"  Barely two days after a harrowing and exhausting escape from Rwanda, the more than a quarter-million refugees who arrived here were soaked by heavy rains, adding to the miseries of their makeshift lives with little shelter or food.

On topics as diverse as trade policy with Japan, human rights and the possible caning of an American teen-ager in Singapore, leaders from Canberra to Tokyo are voicing similar critiques. They say Washington has been arrogant, that the \"community\" it envisions is built in America's image rather than in Asia's, and that it is chiefly interested in imposing its own rules. Driven by Three Goals    Many of the criticisms are self- interested, and some come from countries that insist the region needs a stabilizing American military presence, but reject Washington's political influence.

Leading Robbins, who had a tap-in putt for birdie, by a stroke at the 15th hole, Steinhauer drained a 20-footer for birdie. She followed that with an 18-footer for birdie at the 16th hole and then parred in for a round of 70, a 72-hole total of 15-under-par 273 and a one-stroke victory over Robbins, who closed with 68.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940502","headline":"Less Strategic Now, Grenada Is to Lose American Embassy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/02/world/less-strategic-now-grenada-is-to-lose-american-embassy.html","abstract":"  Little more than a decade after the United States invaded Grenada, ousting a left-wing Government that Ronald Reagan said was turning the tiny Caribbean island into an outpost of Fidel Castro's Cuba, the Clinton Administration plans to close its Embassy there to save money.

Written by the mother-and-daughter team of Cathleen Young and Lee Guthrie -- the sister and mother, respectively, of the actress Sean Young -- the story was inspired, ABC said, by the experience of an actual pediatrics nurse. So it's sort of a docudrama, but let's not get into the more egregious failings of the form, things like putting the words of one Menendez brother into the mouth of the other.

To be sure, South Africa is more urban, better educated -- even its black population -- and more industrial than were its neighbors to the north when they achieved independence.

Since it does not permit a board or pieces, it can be played anywhere, on horseback, for example, as long as the players can report their moves to each other. Quick play probably began not long after the chess clock was introduced in 1883. Joop van Oosterom, a Dutch entrepreneur, brought the two together in his Melody Amber Tournament in Monaco from March 26 to April 7.   The adventurous sponsor assembled almost all the world's top players in this event in which each contested one game against the other 11 at the quick tempo of 25 minutes for each player for all moves. Each also contested a second game against the others at the same tempo but this time neither player was allowed chess pieces. They briefly communicated their moves by mouse on the empty screen of a computer chessboard. The clock invented by Bobby Fischer was used to time both types of game. For the quick game, it gave the players 10 additional seconds each time they moved. For the blindfold-quick game, it gave the players 20 extra seconds each time they moved.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940503","headline":"Understanding Terrorism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/03/opinion/understanding-terrorism.html","abstract":"Again, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat are to shake hands in a momentous ceremony, tomorrow in Cairo.

Can the agreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank work?

Unfortunately, emotions in Israel make the viability of peace with the Palestinians depend on cessation of all terror attacks -- an unrealistic objective. This dream gives the terrorists far too many chips and too much disruptive power. That is why, hard though it may be, Israelis have to realize that terror cannot be completely stopped, even in peacetime, and that while terror endangers individual lives and property, it does not imperil the existence of the state.

The plan was similar to proposals being considered in more than 30 states. It called for raising academic achievement by setting high standards for what children should learn and then testing to make sure they did so. Teachers, in turn, would focus less on grading children and more on helping all children meet those standards. The stated goal was a \"fundamental restructuring\" of public education.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940504","headline":"Clinton Hires Lawyer to Handle Sex Suit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/04/us/clinton-hires-lawyer-to-handle-sex-suit.html","abstract":"  President Clinton has hired a prominent Washington lawyer to represent him if he is sued by a woman who has accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance in 1991, White House officials said today.

Back then, he seemed to be teaching the sonatas, presenting them as gems of crystalized musical imagination, set in velvet and examined in a bright, analytical light. Those accounts were by no means passionless, but their principal appeal was intellectual. Now the excitement Mr. Brendel finds in these works is more visceral, more concerned with the gritty, real-life side of Beethoven's music. The velvet has not entirely been cast aside, but the emphasis has shifted from admiring the music to experiencing it.    The works at hand in this installment of Mr. Brendel's three-year Beethoven cycle were the composer's first three sonatas (Op. 2) and his 23d, the \"Appassionata\" (Op. 57). The juxtaposition of the early works, completed in 1795, and the mature \"Appassionata,\" composed a decade later, tells an interesting story of shattered conventions and conceptual expansion. What Mr. Brendel showed, however, was that the seeds of explosive emotionalism that drive the \"Appassionata\" are to be found in the Opus 2 Sonatas, disguised by a veneer of Haydnesque decorousness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940504","headline":"Casino Cheating 101; Police and Other Officials Learn to Spot Those Who Break the Rules of the Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/04/nyregion/casino-cheating-101-police-other-officials-learn-spot-those-who-break-rules-game.html","abstract":"  Some people mash the blackjack cards with their rings.
