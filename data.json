The room is crowded with white, black, Hispanic and Asian boxers. And at the side of the ring, a lone woman with long braided hair shouts orders and encouragement.   She is Rafaela Rosario, who coaches the Gladiators Boxing Club with her husband, Mike. The two -- he is a hospital worker, she has a part-time job in the Parks Department -- have been training boxers for about 20 years, pulling hundreds of young men off the streets and training them to take out their aggressions in the ring.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Seminoles: Orange; W.

Local chefs have such an enviable head start that one would think they couldn't miss. Well, some do, mostly by gilding the lilies with incongruous sauces and other embellishments.   But when a chef hits the mark here, the results can be sublime. Below is a roundup of some Seattle area restaurants well worth visiting. All exude passionate dedication to regional ingredients like salmon, ling cod, Dungeness crab, spot prawns, Olympia oysters, venison and local mushrooms. Oriental influences are increasingly common, and rarely does one encounter cream-and-butter sauces in this health-conscious corner of the nation.  Dahlia Lounge   On fog-dampened week nights in autumn, downtown Seattle is not exactly a Mardi gras, yet the scene is always spirited at this stylish four-year-old establishment that serves bold (and occasionally bizarre) new American cuisine.   The setting is provocative: soaring ceilings, vermilion walls, vintage neon, illuminated papier-mache fish and flower-patterned banquettes. For all the action in the dining room, it never gets distractingly loud.    Dahlia Lounge is a husband-wife effort, with Tom Douglas running the kitchen and Jackie Cross tending to the guests. Mr. Douglas seems to be an inveterate experimenter.  And just as many of Thomas Edison's early light bulbs probably shattered in his face, so do some of the chef's concoctions.   Why, for example, would anyone take a classic pasta puttanesca, with garlic, olives and tomatoes, and lay over it big slices of rare-seared tuna? It's like adding wings to a Mercedes. A supposedly crisp-skinned garlic duck was not crispy, but rather covered with acrid burned garlic. Green bean risotto seemed like a fine idea, but it wasn't when the beans were served untrimmed and raw.   Those exceptions aside, one can have a perfectly satisfying evening at Dahlia Lounge by cruising in the middle of the road with dishes like butternut squash soup; sauteed Alaskan spot prawns with Provencal herbs; grilled Alaska king salmon with ginger-sake butter, and grilled rosemary lamb chops with smoked-tomato ratatouille.  Kaspar's   In Seattle, the options for waterfront dining are diverse. One of the more imaginative spots is Kaspar's, a semicasual restaurant atop an office building overlooking the shipyards of Elliott Bay.   Kaspar Donier, the chef-owner, is Swiss-born, but he wears his zeal for Northwest products on his sleeve. Nancy Donier, his wife, is a welcoming and earnest hostess. Mr. Donier offers two menus: one featuring his signature dishes, another with nightly specials. On a recent evening one special was exceptionally light ravioli filled with sweet rock prawns and spinach, all in a refreshingly light lemon sauce. His shellfish and wild rice chowder, from the regular menu, was creamy and delightfully briny, overflowing with mussels, scallops and clams. Firm, fresh gnocchi was the richest appetizer, as the dumplings were paired with artichoke hearts and napped in a rich, tasty Gruyere-flavored sauce. Only the Dungeness crab hash went unfinished for lack of seasoning.   Three signature main courses are good bets: rare-cooked king salmon under a latticework of crunchy fried potatoes, braised lamb shank with garlic and rosemary sauce, and bouillabaisse built on a sturdy fish stock with the addition of lentils.    Kaspar's has a good selection of Northwest wines at average prices. As for desserts, let the chef put together an assortment -- plum tart with cardamom-and-rum ice cream; pecan-and-sweet-potato pie with Grand Marnier cream, and ripe-fruit sorbets are among the choices. Wild Ginger   If you want to know what East-meets-West cooking is all about, Wild Ginger is the place to find out. The creation of the young, soft-spoken owner, Rick Yoder, who spent several years in Southeast Asia filling his cognitive shopping cart with ideas, this is perhaps the most provocative, and fun, restaurant in Seattle.   The big open dining room with cream-tinted walls, dramatic lighting and high-backed wooden booths is both casual and formal. A mahogany satay bar is a wonderful spot for a quick snack or multicourse tasting.  All three satays sampled were arresting: pork basted with coconut milk and served with a complex hot sauce; large prawns in an Indonesian-style marinade of garlic, galangal (a type of ginger), chili and coconut, and a simple but delicious plate of grilled, garlic-infused Chinese eggplant.   Choosing wines to match these exotic flavors is a challenge. High acid sauvignon blancs and chenin blancs work well, as do some beers.   Main courses to try include sweet-hot black-pepper scallops with a soy and rice-wine dipping sauce; roasted duck seasoned with cinnamon and star anise and served with steamed buns that are used to make little sandwiches, and any of the noodle dishes. The steamed Chilean sea bass with shallot sauce, recommended by the waiter, lacked pizazz compared with the other dishes. Wild Ginger offers impressive daily vegetarian specials, something that is much in demand in this part of the country.  Szmania's   This smart-looking, friendly spot in the residential village of Magnolia, about 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, typifies the trend for top chefs to move from the city to outlying areas. The dining room is cheerful and bright, with lots of blond wood, colorful local art and a horseshoe-shaped dining bar.   The strapping German-born chef and owner, Ludger Szmania (SMAHN-yah), was previously chef at the highly regarded Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. His menu defies description -- a little Pacific Northwest, a little Oriental, some German and Mexican thrown in for good measure.  Yet his mastery of blending flavors is immediately evident.   At lunch you can start with nicely browned Dungeness crab cakes with a roasted-pepper aioli, grilled Oriental chicken salad with a sprightly ginger-sesame dressing or a tortilla salad with spicy seafood and roasted peppers. Main courses include tasty smoked mozzarella ravioli in a simple but pleasing fresh tomato sauce or perfectly roasted monkfish under a lid of homemade potato chips with a light chanterelle cream sauce.   The signature dessert is Magnolia dream cake, a stratified indulgence of peanut butter cream, chocolate cake and chocolate mousse. The Herbfarm   What began as a backyard herb garden selling at a roadside stand in this gloriously rustic area about 30 minutes east of Seattle has evolved into a leafy wonderland and one of the best restaurants in the Pacific Northwest. It is also highly sought after, with an extremely restrictive reservations policy (see listing on page 6). The Herbfarm is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday only.    A visit to The Herbfarm can be much more than an extraordinary meal. It also includes a tour of the magnificent, meticulously cultivated theme gardens -- 17 in all, covering 6 acres -- and kitchen garden. In addition, guests are given talks on the food's provenance and preparation by the owners and the chef during the nine-course tasting meal (there is only one menu, which changes weekly), and samplings of greenery that you never suspected were suitable for two-legged species.   A recent dinner in the enchanting cottage that houses the restaurant, which seats only 32, started with a glass of dry 1988 Argyle Oregon Brut topped with sprigs of lemon verbena.    \"You will notice that the herb gives the sparkling wine a wonderful aroma, but it does not affect the flavor at all,\" explained Ron Zimmerman, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Carrie Van Dyck. The table was set with name cards atop mini-pumpkins, elegant silver and stemware and an arrangement of wildflowers and herbs.   Each course is prepared in an open kitchen by the chef, Jerry Traunfeld, with detailed explanations of each ingredient. \"During the evening you will be served many strange and different flowers,\" he said. \"And all are edible unless we say otherwise.\"   The first course was an aromatic tart of wild boletus mushrooms from southern Alaska, onions and marjoram, along with nasturtiums stuffed with nasturtium capers, and tiny Olympia oysters. From there it got exotic: a briny combination of Dungeness crab-and-fennel dumplings, Whidbey Island mussels, Pacific spot prawns and wild cauliflower mushrooms; little pumpkins containing pumpkin gnocchi with chanterelles and sage under shavings of a local sheep's-milk cheese, and herb-smoked wild king salmon (\"Line caught,\" Mr. Traunfeld assured us) with beet and arugula sauces.   The show went on at a blissfully slow pace -- more than three hours -- as we reveled in herb-encrusted local lamb with a ginger and coriander sauce, a magnificent salad of wild greens and flowers, a splendid apple souffle and apple-caramel ice cream.Five Pacific Northwest wines accompanied the meal, which concluded with a vibrant 1927 Madeira.   All of this luxury comes at a price: dinner came to $115 a person with wine; the six-course lunch is $50. page 6, sub head only  SAMPLING A SPIRITED DINING SCENE    Prices given below, with the exception of The Herbfarm, include a glass of house wine.

This is the primary distinction of \"Poverty Pop: The Esthetics of Necessity,\" a timely yet problematic show at Exit Art/The First World in SoHo. Its focus is the widespread practice among youngish artists of parlaying found, often worn, materials and objects into art. Such efforts constitute the visual equivalent of grunge, but they also perpetuate one of the most resilient, if cliched, legacies of Modernism: assemblage, the common cockroach of 20th-century techniques.    At least since Kurt Schwitters and the Dadaists, artists have been inspired to work with things found on the street, in the attic or dustbin or at the dime store. It saves money on materials and at the same time makes a statement about materialism, both in art and in the world at large. In the downscale 90's, the art of recycled objects has been on the upswing, a symptom of the straitened economy, of growing environmental awareness and also of the decade's rejection of its predecessor. In the 80's, artists appropriated glamorous images and sparkling new merchandise, critiquing commodity culture while producing rather desirable commodities themselves. Now, commodity culture is more often examined through its castoffs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Miss O'Malley And Mr. Quinn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/style/weddings-miss-o-malley-and-mr-quinn.html","abstract":"  Katherine Ann O'Malley, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. James A.

An important part of the work couldn't make the trip, however; the Chapelle du Rosaire in Vence, near Nice, designed by Matisse with a Dominican brother and two architects from 1948 to 1951 for the Dominican sisters there. It was represented in the exhibition only by the vestments the artist designed and by photographs of the chapel's luminous stained glass windows and of Matisse working in bed on the designs for them. \n\nIn June 1943, when it became clear that Nice would not be safe from bombing, Matisse -- then 79 -- left his home there and retired a few miles inland to Vence. Although the war was to follow the old man to Vence -- three bombs fell in his garden -- his stay was extraordinarily productive. One of the fruits of those years was the chapel he designed for the Dominican sisters, who ran a convalescent home across the street from Matisse's home. He owed the Dominicans a debt of gratitude, perhaps his life: they had cared for him in Lyons during a difficult convalescence from surgery earlier in the war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"From Little Packages Come Big Sounds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/arts/pop-music-from-little-packages-come-big-sounds-815893.html","abstract":"  WHEN \"CROSSROADS,\" A FOURCD boxed set chronicling the career of Eric Clapton, went gold shortly after it was released in 1988, the recording industry took notice.

It's not just that there's more competition than ever for funds, or that her company has outgrown its tiny space (108 seats) and can't break even, or that the actors and directors she wants to work with have all fled to Hollywood so they can eat.   It's that in the last three years, Ms. Rothman has lost both her professional and personal partners. Robyn Goodman, Second Stage Theater's co-founder and co-artistic director, left more than a year ago to work in television; and in 1991, Ms. Rothman's husband, Dr. Stuart Forster, died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 44, leaving her with a 7-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Art to Snuggle Under","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/books/art-to-snuggle-under.html","abstract":"  THE AMERICAN QUILT A History of Cloth and Comfort 1750-1950.

All you have to do is look offshore and watch for a big bump. By that standard, it takes no special genius to see that President Clinton and his staff have fastened on crime.   It is an impulse to be saluted, especially since Mr. Clinton does not seem drawn to the simplistic -- and sometimes demagogic -- approach embodied in Nixon-Reagan-Bush rhetoric. Their main theme was that the nation could stamp out crime by chasing and punishing criminals more relentlessly. But several decades of experience have proved beyond reasonable doubt that a purely punitive approach can, at best, hold the line.

What about educating, starting with a campaign of public service messages designed to remind all street users of the ample laws already on the books, instead of singling out one group?   It is disingenuous of Mr. Lipsyte to imply that this bill is balanced by one of Mr. Millard's other bills that calls for fines for motorists caught in bike lanes. In the previous week's City section, it was reported that the Avenue of America bike lane is being removed and that to \"appease\" cyclists the city was installing bike racks there.

I watch my 9-year-old son race dozens of brilliant Sally Lightfoot crabs over the black braided ropes of lava. I see him pirouette with baby sea lions, I watch him inspire the trust of the curious Galapagos mockingbird until it rests its trembling body next to his trembling hand.   Last June Josh and I boarded a 60-foot motor sailer, Beagle III, and ventured into the unknown in more ways than we had imagined. We booked onto a seven-day \"family\" cruise around the islands that was made up of nine strangers (four families of various parent-child combinations) who were thrown together in a living space that even honeymooners might find too intimate. The double bunk rooms were burnished with pine trim but endowed with just enough floor space for one person to get dressed. In the two miniature bathrooms, you could sit on the head and take a shower at the same time. But what the handsome old yacht lacked in comfort, it made up for in funky charm. A former research boat with the archipelago's Darwin Research Station, the Beagle had sprawling two-level deck space, an environmental conscience (no unrecyclable cans aboard), a quirky crew of three Ecuadoreans and their Ecuadorean captain, who roughhoused with the kids when they weren't cooking up hearty, if oversalted, feasts of fresh vegetables and fish, and Fabio Penafiel, a sharp-eyed English-speaking naturalist who not only knew every species on the islands, but could often bring them forth by imitating their calls.

For example, at the emotional leadup to the next in the modern superpower cycle of tidy, winnable wars, a pacifist might bear Shaw in mind: \"Patriotism is a pernicious, psychopathic form of idiocy.\" In the same spirit there is Shaw on Christmas: \"Christmas is forced on a reluctant and disgusted nation by the shopkeepers and the press: on its own merits it would wither and shrivel in the fiery breath of universal hatred; and anyone who looked back to it would be turned into a pillar of greasy sausages.\"   All right, so you can't quite agree. But keep in mind that in wielding his pen like a nasty shard of truth, Shaw could just as easily have been idly window-shopping here and now, taking Shavian note of some of the Yuletide features offered in neighborhood boites for consumers searching beyond the everything already possessed. There is Assumption Abbey fruitcake, for example, on fancy display for a pretty penny in one East Side shop, and so valued because it is made to the recipe of \"world-class chef Jean-Pierre Auge\" and baked in the Ozarks by silence-enshrouded Trappist monks whose lives are, incidentally, dedicated to the world-class messiah of the current seasonal tidings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Leaping From E Street to 'Late Night'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/arts/television-leaping-from-e-street-to-late-night.html","abstract":"  WHEN MAX WEINBERG was a teen-ager, he had a drum teacher named Gene Thaler who would tell him stories about his friend Ed Shaughnessy, the drummer in the \"Tonight Show\" band. \"He always used to say what a great gig that is,\" Mr. Weinberg recalled. \"You get lots of money and then you go home, and you don't have to go on the road.

Not the way Gerry Boyle tells it in DEADLINE (North Country Press, $17.95), a bone-cracking first novel set in a gritty mill town where the snow starts falling around Labor Day and the hearts of the citizenry stay frozen all year round. That's how it seems to Jack McMorrow, a jaded newsman who has fled New York City to edit The Androscoggin Review. McMorrow runs into granite indifference from the town cops when his staff photographer is found floating in an icy canal, but he attracts plenty of rough attention when he does a little muckraking on the local paper mill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"Today In The City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/nyregion/today-in-the-city.html","abstract":"  TO MARKETS!

Though every bit in step with the cultural revolution taking place in Harlem at the time, Mr. Lawrence owed much of his early success to the art dealer Edith Gregor Halper, who, after showing the panels in her Greenwich Village gallery, succeeded in selling half of the series to the Museum of Modern Art and the remaining paintings to the Phillips Collection in Washington. The Phillips has now reunited the paintings in a traveling exhibition for which it has produced this handsome catalog, JACOB LAWRENCE: The Migration Series (Rappahannock Press, 1627 I Street, Suite 610, Washington, D.C. 20006, $40), edited by the show's curator, Elizabeth Hutton Turner. Ten scholars, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., have contributed historical footnotes to Mr. Lawrence's career, as well as lucid commentary on the sources of the social and political conditions that gave rise to the mass black exodus north. Most telling, however, are the paintings themselves, which dramatize the story of the migration -- not only the hopes, fears and hardships of a people leaving home and friends for the unknown, but the anonymity and despair many experienced once they had arrived, finding tenement life, dead-end jobs, and a new form of racial discrimination based on custom rather than law. \"We are absolutely a people telling stories,\" Mr. Lawrence has said, a concept that he illustrates with particular grace in these eloquent paintings.

Housing analysts attribute the increase to the decline of mortgage rates, which have fallen to 25-year lows, and to home prices, which are not rising as much as they did in the 80's in most parts of the country. They note, though, that homeownership rates, especially among people under 35, remain lower than in the early 1980's, evidence of unaffordable prices, stagnating wages, job insecurity and changing demographic trends.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19931128","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE;\nHelping Elderly Fend Off Fraud","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-side-helping-elderly-fend-off-fraud.html","abstract":"In the 19th Precinct, which covers the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the number of reported frauds and con games against older people is growing, the police say.

Centuries ago, the region was the largest olive-oil center in the Near East.\n\nDr. Gitlin's presentation, under the auspices of the Long Island Society of the Archeological Institute of America, will be at 8 P.M. in the Great Neck South Middle School on Lakeville Road (487-7888).\nHOLLYWOOD TO ADELPHI\n\n When not dazzling juries as Jonathan Rollins on \"L.A.

The production combines \"The Second Shepherd's Play,\" a Nativity tale by an anonymous Medieval playwright known as the Wakefield Master, with Romulous Linney's contemporary \"Why the Lord Come to Sand Mountain,\" a humorous fable set in Appalachia.\n\nThe work will be performed at 8 P.M. from Thursday through Saturday and from Dec. 9 to 11 and also at 2 P.M. next Sunday in the Staller Center (632-7230).\n\nTo Theater Three on Main Street in Port Jefferson goes the distinction of the first version of the season of Dickens's \"Christmas Carol.

In addition to focusing on his relationships with his wife and a beautiful young model, the film examined the process of creating a work of art.\n\nBut four-hour films are hard to attract the public, and so with two hours cut from the original and the focus changed to concentrate on the personal stories more than the technical aspect of painting, the movie has been re-released as \"Divertimento.\" \n\nThe Cinema Arts Center on Park Avenue in Huntington is offering the two versions, the shortened one from Friday through Dec. 6 and the original next Sunday and on Dec. 7. (423-7610).\nJULIE ANDREWS BENEFIT\n\n Julie Andrews will be in Sag Harbor on Saturday to offer \"One on One Again: An Evening of Festive Songs for the Season.\" Accompanied by the pianist Ian Fraser, Ms. Andrews will appear at 8 P.M. in the Old Whaler's Church on Union Street. \n\nThe concert will be preceded by a cocktail hour at a nearby private house and followed by a dinner, with Ms. Andrews as host, at the American Hotel.

The opera, conducted by Cal Stewart Kellogg and directed by Bodo Igesz, will be in Italian with English supertitles at 8 P.M. in Tilles Center on the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville.\n\nPuccini's \"Boheme\" on March 19 and Verdi's \"Trovatore\" on May 14 complete the season (248-1040). \nHOUSE AND STUDIO TOURS\n\n The Three Village Historical Society holds its 15th Candlelight House Tour from noon to 6 P.M. on Saturday, when six houses in Setauket, Stony Brook, Old Field and Poquott are on a self-guided tour (751-3730).\n\nIn Sea Cliff, artisans and craftsmen in the Victorian village will open their studios and workshops from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday for the 19th Arts and Crafts Tour, also self-guided.

Rosen baum with William Hoffer (Oct. 10), Jacob Heilbrunn leaves readers with the impression that Mr. Rosenbaum is not to be trusted because he would have us believe that Mr. Waldheim and Simon Wiesenthal are Nazis of some sort.   Actually, I believe Mr. Rosenbaum is saying something very different: he claims that Mr. Wiesenthal is fallible, after all, despite the veneration often expressed for him. He erred 15 years ago in \"clearing\" Mr. Waldheim because he didn't know about the damaging pictures and documents that the World Jewish Congress would later unearth. Because he erred, he vouchsafed Mr. Waldheim's reputation and, in so doing, conveniently hurt an old enemy, Bruno Kreisky. He persisted, Mr. Rosenbaum says, to save his own reputation and place in history long after he should have climbed down from the Waldheim defense bandwagon.   But this is surely not \"Nazi\" activity, and Mr. Rosenbaum never implies that.

Mr. Gray has described himself as a \"poetic journalist,\" and his particular skills as an observer have always hinged on a dialectic seesaw between satiric clarity and paranoiac murkiness.

He would complain publicly and frequently about being the prisoner of a single role and an unchanging formula, but the money and the power, which he wielded with aplomb, proved irresistible. He died at 76 in September, his last performing effort devoted to still another \"Perry Mason\" case, part of a series of periodic two-hour features carried on NBC since 1985.    Tonight's \"Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss\" involves, appropriately enough, a gaggle of soap-opera denizens, one of them murdered, the rest suspects. Created in a series of best-selling novels by Erle Stanley Gardner, the lawyer and author, the defense lawyer Perry Mason moved on to radio in 1943 where, for 12 years, five days a week, he was a character in a series that was part soap opera, part detective story. When that series was adapted in 1956 for television as the afternoon soap \"The Edge of Night,\" the characters were given new names. The name Perry Mason was reserved for the Raymond Burr weekly series that would run until 1966.    \"The Killer Kiss\" hews to basic cookie-cutter form. Several characters are brought together, in this instance working on a soap opera. One is always abrasive or worse, and he or she will wind up the murder victim. The police pounce on a prime suspect, who often turns out to have some acquaintance with Perry Mason (\"Her father was a judge,\" he will casually explain, \"her mother a law clerk\").    He takes the case, begins his investigation and, by the time of trial, everyone in the immediate vicinity is looking suspicious. His devoted secretary, Della Street, played from the beginning by Barbara Hale, can always be depended on for some motherly hovering. In increasing pain over the years from assorted ailments, the rather massive Mr. Burr is almost always sitting or leaning on some sturdy prop.    The trial unfolds with the inevitability of Greek drama. Viewers are assured of a tidy beginning, middle and end. The prosecuting attorney opens with overweening confidence but, inasmuch as Perry Mason has lost only one trial over all these years -- in 1963, and only because his client refused to enter evidence that would save her -- viewers are hardly in doubt about the outcome.    Even the judges, apparently awed by basso-voiced authority, are prone to give Perry Mason unusual courtroom leeway. And when the lawyer's investigative assistant rushes into the courtroom with the latest piece of uncovered evidence, it's only a matter of minutes before the true culprit blurts out something like: \"He was going to take it all. I couldn't let him do that.\" Tonight's final installment, starring a slew of real soap-opera actors, doesn't miss a well-worn trick.    Like Eugene O'Neill's father doomed to playing the Count of Monte Cristo for much of his professional career, Raymond Burr may well have felt suffocated by the role of Perry Mason. The problem is that Mr. Burr did it to perfection, even when on automatic pilot. For a while in the early 1970's, he did some wheelchair sleuthing as \"Ironside,\" but that was just riding on Perry Mason's coattails.    CBS tried to revive the \"Perry Mason\" series in 1973 with Monte Markham in the title role. No way. Mr. Burr had put a lock on the property. The actor and the role were bonded forever. It's one way, and certainly not the worst, to live the always precarious life of a performer.

So secretive are their sale and deployment that nobody really knows where or how many mines remain in the ground.

He's sensitive, but with a smirk. He's literate without being intellectual. And he's emotional without being messy about it. Mr. Dando, a 26-year-old hunk, is perfect for his huge audience of teen-age girls, and for much of his show on Saturday night at Roseland his audience sang along with his songs, producing a high-pitched sound that was mostly drowned out by the band's grinding sound. He's everything a teen-ager would want to be: smart, good-looking, successful, and still wearing T-shirts and ratty jeans.   One of rock's main tensions has always between melody and sound, between the contours of a song and the exuberant annihilation of blasting, distorted guitars. Mr. Dando is an extraordinary melodist with a flair for a 60's pop sound, and his best songs have the sort of logic all great melodies share: they seem so obvious, and it's hard not to wonder why they hadn't been written before. On his records, Mr. Dando emphasizes his pop side, all within an alternative, post-punk framework that's not always convincing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931129","headline":"New York May Need To Expand Boundaries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/29/nyregion/metro-matters-new-york-may-need-to-expand-boundaries.html","abstract":"  \"NO man is an island,\" the politically incorrect John Donne wrote.

But the questions raised by the business group did not dwell on the prospect of lower taxes. Instead, the audience at the speech in West Windsor asked how such a huge cut could fail to force a reduction in state aid to wealthy districts like theirs -- and a similar increase in property taxes.

Mike Tranghese, the commissioner of the Big East Conference, said yesterday he was told that the West Virginia administration had informed Cotton Bowl officials that the school prefers to play in New Orleans against the winner of Saturday's Southeastern Conference championship game between Alabama and Florida, rather than meeting Southwest Conference champion Texas A&M in Dallas. Another person close to the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Cotton Bowl officials had been told of West Virginia's preference.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931130","headline":"Intrum Gets Break in Whitbread","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/30/sports/IHT-intrum-gets-break-in-whitbread.html","abstract":"The W60 class sloop Intrum Justitia overtook the crippled New Zealand Endeavour and sailed into the lead of the Whitbread 'Round the World Race on Monday after the giant maxi ketch had the top of its smaller mast broken off. .According to the latest re","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931130","headline":"Detecting Patterns in Pounding Breakers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/30/technology/detecting-patterns-in-pounding-breakers.html","abstract":"  FOR decades, scientists worried about beach erosion have struggled to understand exactly what goes on in the surf zone, where breakers stir up sand and carry it away.
