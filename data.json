Shostakovich created a Soviet version of \"Madame Bovary\" in which Katerina, a bored, bourgeois housewife, faced with an almost criminally banal society, discovers the pleasures and dangers of love and murder (both of which sound astonishingly similar in the score).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941112","headline":"Indonesia Wastes a Chance to Demonstrate Candid Self-Confidence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/12/opinion/IHT-indonesia-wastes-a-chance-to-demonstrate-candid-selfconfidence.html","abstract":"Indonesia has a tendency to shoot itself in the foot.

Anyone who has ever felt rage -- at a child, a parent, a spouse, a vanished lover -- has at least entertained the fantasy of losing control, even if only in the involuntary form of a nightmare. We feel the horror of Susan Smith's crime not because it's unimaginable but precisely because we can imagine it.

As a result, the 36.2 percent of the vote that gave Mr. Rowland his victory represents a narrow slice of Connecticut both demographically and geographically: 97 percent white, and heavily drawn from the two Congressional districts encompassing the southwestern part of the state.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"In Search of the Man Within the Monster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/movies/in-search-of-the-man-within-the-monster.html","abstract":"  ONE VAMPIRE TO ANOTHER, Antonio Banderas looks into Brad Pitt's icy-blue eyes and sizes him up: \"A vampire with a human soul.\"    That's not necessarily a compliment in the land of the undead, but it's accurate and goes a long way toward explaining why Neil Jordan's new movie, \"Interview With the Vampire,\" is one of the most horrific, emotional and best films of the year. Though Tom Cruise gets star billing, this is the haunting tale of Louis (Mr. Pitt), a reluctant vampire who struggles across two centuries to retain some shred of human emotion. Changing from man to vampire, he learns to sip blood and live in the dark. (\"Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity,\" he tells the interviewer recording his life story.) But through it all he continues to feel love, guilt, grief; he is a vampire we can identify with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"New Paris Rail Station Is Link to Major Cities","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/travel/travel-advisory-new-paris-rail-station-is-link-to-major-cities.html","abstract":"  A new stop on France's rail network is about to be added at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, making it possible for air travelers to connect to cities throughout France and Europe.

No problem), but also a captivating soundtrack and a host of interactive distractions.   GRANDMA AND ME, by Mercer Mayer (for Macintosh and Windows; Living Books, $39.95 suggested; ages 2 to 5) was the first in the series and remains the standard-bearer of the Living Books line. The protagonist is Mr. Mayer's well-known Little Critter, an unflaggingly cute little fellow whose bloodlines apparently descend from chipmunk and woodchuck. In this episode, Critter's sprightly Grandma accompanies him on a beach outing. The story harbors very little conflict -- save a tussle with a crab -- but much charm. The viewer can choose to have the story read aloud, much as it might have been before electronic media, or watch it unfold in a more free-form style. As each virtual page appears on the screen, a voice reads the brief text (each word lights up as it is sounded), and then the real fun begins. The screen becomes a playground; almost every character and object on the screen is now a \"hot button\" for an amusing animated sequence; touch the sand castle, for instance, and a little phalanx of bugs marches out over a drawbridge.

It was Walter Becker, who played bass and guitar and left the lead vocals to his songwriting partner, Donald Fagen.

And it turns out he has exactly the right voice for his own words: a groan that's jaded, long-suffering, cranky and shrewd. The first words Becker sings are \"In case you're wondering, it's alive and well.\"    Becker is as much an oddball now as Steely Dan was during its million-selling reign in the 1970's. On seven remarkable albums from 1972 to 1979, Steely Dan perfected stealth pop: songs in which calm tempos and suave production cloaked unlikely musical twists and lyrics about topics like stock-market crashes, Puerto Rican immigration or the golden age of be-bop. Only Paul Simon, Randy Newman and the best Brazilian songwriters showed the same musical sophistication, while Steely Dan had a terse cynicism all its own: a fascination with sleaze and duplicity that was one part hipster slumming, two parts film noir.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"Changing Roles For a Landmark","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/realestate/l-changing-roles-for-a-landmark-787108.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   It's hardly a matter requiring a correction, but I was startled by the color photo run with your Posting on Oct. 23 headed \"Changing Roles for a Landmark.\" It was a shot of the renovated Custom House, and it appeared mottled in a way suggesting perhaps brick-and-limestone construction -- which I knew was not the case.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"TAKING THE CHILDREN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/movies/taking-the-children-798487.html","abstract":"  Mary Shelley's Frankenstein  Kenneth Branagh, Robert De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter Directed by Kenneth Branagh R 128 minutes","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"Clinton Begins Pacific Visit in Manila","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/world/clinton-begins-pacific-visit-in-manila.html","abstract":"  President Clinton began a Pacific tour here this morning with somber stops to honor nearly a century of economic and security ties between the United States and the Philippines, its first colony.

Less compatible were the more celebrated pairings of Chopin and George Sand, Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, and Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas. But their stories, illustrated in color by Edward Sorel and retold spiritedly and concisely by Nancy Caldwell Sorel (they relate their own first meeting and subsequent marriage in an afterword), all benefit from a light touch. What is the book's most memorable meeting? Possibly the one between Fats Waller and Al Capone, who kidnapped the musician for a three-day party. Equally appealing, though it relies entirely on Welles's authority, is the story of the encounter between William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles in an elevator in the Fairmont Hotel the day of the San Francisco premiere of \"Citizen Kane.\" Welles introduced himself and invited Hearst to attend, but was met with stony silence.

Painters have long supported the neutrality that the Modern represents: in the 1950's a score of prominent artists complained to the Guggenheim Museum that the sloping walls and curved ramps of Frank Lloyd Wright's spinning rotunda would fail to provide \"the rectilinear frame of reference necessary for the adequate visual contemplation of works of art.\" Wright's design, which is indeed inhospitable to some kinds of art but glorious for others, continues to fuel the deep suspicion many artists harbor toward architects.   But a growing number of architects are resisting what they regard as restrictive spaces that limit viewers to a single position in front of an object. One architect weary of what he calls the missionary position is Wolfgang Prix, who has designed -- among many other art projects -- studios for Anselm Kiefer, a painter who climbs ladders, lies prone and stands on his head to \"test\" his compositions. Two weeks ago, when Queen Beatrix opened the Groninger Museum of Art in Groningen, the Netherlands, Mr. Prix, its designer, led her on catwalks through a turbulent landscape of tilted and angled walls that afford more than one way to see a painting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"Building, No League, for Budig","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/sports/sports-people-baseball-building-no-league-for-budig.html","abstract":"  GENE BUDIG, who became American League president 11 days before the players went on strike, hasn't had much opportunity to make his mark on baseball, but he is still remembered and will continue to be remembered at the University of Kansas.

What orchestra in the United States, or Europe for that matter, can boast a more lustrous lineage than that?   True, by the mid-80's, under the leadership of Sergiu Comissiona, the Houston Symphony was playing indifferently and was on the verge of dropping from the top tier of regional orchestras into sheer mediocrity. But in 1988, Christoph Eschenbach, then better known as a concert pianist than as a conductor, was appointed music director, and by all accounts he has transformed the orchestra, which is said by some to be playing at the highest technical and interpretive levels of its 81-year history.

The stores contained an excellent array of goods. I bought a bronze chess set there, with figures from Greek history and myths, that is now one of my most prized possessions. And all else was glorious: the Valley of the Butterflies, the Castle of the Counts, the Temple of Diana on its promontory overlooking the sea and a delightful white town that Ms. Spano can only denigrate because of the large number of tourists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"The Sublime, the Modern and the Literal in Views of the Land","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/nyregion/art-the-sublime-the-modern-and-the-literal-in-views-of-the-land.html","abstract":"  IN the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College, it is all landscape -- painted, drawn, printed and photographed or else implied by sculpture.

It is a world where passion usually takes a back seat to duty and honor. Poussin was the ultimate painter-philosopher, contemplative and unostentatious in his life and his work. A laborious and painstaking craftsman, he had none of the visceral swagger that we admire in the work of his 17th-century contemporaries, like Rubens, Bernini, Velazquez and Rembrandt.

I understand there is a fault line that runs under New York City. Where does it run? When was the last earthquake? Are there any predictions about the next one -- and are New York skyscrapers designed to withstand such a thing? I've heard reports that a large earthquake (over 5 on the Richter scale) is overdue for New York City. Is this true? A.  Everyone knows New York City has more than its share of faults. At least two run across upper Manhattan, one along 125th Street and another near Dyckman Street in Inwood.    The last big earthquake in the city was on Aug. 10, 1884. Equivalent to 5.5 on the Richter scale and centered under New York Harbor, it toppled hundreds of chimneys in the city and woke up chickens in western Pennsylvania. John Armbruster, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., said the next \"big one\" might not be far away. \"A magnitude 5 hits the New York area about every 100 years,\" he said. \"This is the longest period known without a magnitude 5 in New York.\"   And what might a magnitude 5, apparently 10 years overdue, do when it comes? Mr. Armbruster said the major skyscrapers in New York, including the older ones like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, have been built to withstand that kind of shock. Some other buildings however, especially those built before the age of modern construction techniques, like brownstones, might not fare as well. Unlike Los Angeles, New York City has no building regulations specifically meant to prevent earthquake damage.   Barriers of Progress   Q.  While walking my dog in Riverside Park, I've noticed very sturdy barriers -- about chest high and built from two-by-four's -- around a lot of the trees. I've seen smaller versions in dog runs and in other parks, but these are much more forbidding. Why are they there? A.  Well, it has nothing to do with your dog. The presence of these large barriers usually means that there's a capital works project somewhere in the area, said Parke Spencer, director of public information for the Parks Department. The department makes the barriers big enough to protect trees from asphalt trucks and other heavy equipment. The barriers also provide protective skirts around the bases of trees, where roots might be damaged. While they are not attractive, the department says the barriers are effective in minimizing harm to trees. And like most projects, they are temporary.  Out of (but in) Business   Q.  Has a midtown \"going out of business\" retailer ever actually gone out of business? Is there a city \"going out of business\" license, and how long is it good for? How much is the fine for having a \"going out of business\" sale without a permit? A.  A license to go out of business? In New York, yes.   The Department of Consumer Affairs issues licenses to failing businesses that give them 30 days to hold closing sales and shut up shop (with the option for two 30-day renewals). The move to begin licensing these merchants came after consumers complained about nonstop farewells, with inflated prices instead of the expected bargains. Electronics stores on Fifth Avenue in midtown were particularly blatant, said Pat Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Consumer Affairs. \"People would open with a going-out-of-business sale,\" she said.   Businesses that violate the terms of the license or restock their merchandise can be fined up to $100 a day, though Ms. Cohen admits that checking for restocking is difficult. Under a 1982 law, the Department of Consumer Affairs can close businesses that violate its permits, so long-term \"going out of business\" businesses could, eventually, find themselves closed for real. Although midtown is full of stores that are faking failure, Ms. Cohen says progress is being made. \"Word has gotten around,\" she said. \"There's fewer of these places than 10 years ago.\"   Complaints about chronic closers can be made to the Department of Consumer Affairs, (212) 487-4398.

The Proclaimers might have been over and done with after they released two well-received albums in the 1980's, but when a four-year-old song of theirs, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles),\" was revived for the film \"Benny and Joon\" last year, these latter-day Everly Brothers returned.

They performed a sema, the Sufi ritual of spiritual rebirth, before a sold-out house on Friday night at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. It was a spectacle: six men dressed in white with tall camel-hair hats, with arms outstretched and long skirts twirling, accompanied by music that slowly gathered momentum, from stately extended melodies to more vigorous, more rhythmic tunes.    The white costumes represent death shrouds; the hats, tombstones. In the mystical Islam that was taught by Jalal ad-Din Rumi, sometimes known as Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273), the spinning dancers are a link between earthly existence and rapturous divine love. There was no chaos, no abandon in their ecstasy. As they whirled, the dervishes proceeded in a circle around the stage, comparable to orbiting planets, while their dancing master strolled among them. They never lost direction, collided or showed dizziness when they stopped for ceremonial bows. Yet unlike twirling ballet dancers, they moved their heads along with their bodies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"At 633 License Suspensions, The Top Scofflaw Is Arrested","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/at-633-license-suspensions-the-top-scofflaw-is-arrested.html","abstract":"  He called himself Bobby Leonard or Harvey Linen, Leroy Linden or something else, and he used various addresses, real and unreal, the police said.

She told them they spoke with \"forked tongues,\" she read to them from the Psalms of David (\"they have opened wicked and treacherous mouths against me\") and she berated them for \"bringing the city to ruin.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Albert Symphony Has a Posthumous Premiere","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/arts/music-review-albert-symphony-has-a-posthumous-premiere.html","abstract":"  At his death in an auto accident in 1992, the composer Stephen Albert was working on a theory of what he called harmonic fields in music. Presumably the idea was that much music that did not literally use traditional tonal harmony created its tensions and resolutions with large, vaguer areas of harmonic force. Albert may have written his Second Symphony as an example. It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and received its premiere during the weekend's series of subscription concerts conducted by Hugh Wolff. Albert completed a short score before his death, indicating about half the instrumentation; a colleague, Sebastian Currier, felt very little else was required and orchestrated the piece based on his knowledge of Albert's style.   Much of Albert's previous music was inspired by literary texts, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Riverrun\" (1984). The Second Symphony, though, is a piece of absolute, abstract music. Its three movements last about a half-hour, during which there are identifiable key regions. The third -- a familiar interval in tonal music -- gives the work much of its coloration. There are even, here and there, tonal melodies that echo late Romanticism. The work is full of allusions to earlier styles, including both Mahler (in the sarcastic-sounding second movement) and Copland (in the elegiac passages of the last). The label neo-Romantic was often applied to Albert; this piece deserves to be called his Neo-Romantic Symphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/c-corrections-825328.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about a surge in the Chiron Corporation's stock price misstated the stock's trading activity on Thursday in some copies.

They say the ailing health of 90-year-old Deng Xiaoping is brewing power struggles between reformers and conservatives, just as the conflicts between the radical Gang of Four and the moderates escalated during Mao Zedong's waning days. Mr. Deng's death, this theory goes, could lead to a period of instability reminiscent of the palace coup in 1976 that resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of the Gang of Four.\n\nSuch a comparison is tempting but flawed. Mr. Deng is not Chairman Mao. He shares power with a handful of octogenarians -- some in robust health -- and he often needs to compromise on key policy and personnel issues. And for all Mr. Deng's might, his departure will not leave a power vacuum nearly as gaping as the one Mao's death created in 1976.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/sports/results-plus-865052.html","abstract":"  N.B.A.  Askew's Career High Helps Seattle Win  Vincent Askew scored 9 of his career-high 20 points in the fourth quarter yesterday as the Seattle SuperSonics defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 115-90, in Tacoma, Wash.

For the 1990's, the popular trappings include a buffer of guitars -- often distorted or discordant -- and lyrics that fracture or ignore the romantic verities of older pop. Mere melody can seem too sweet, not tough enough; fierce guitars and booming drums eliminate any wimpiness. On Saturday night at Roseland, Sugar, Velocity Girl and Magnapop were a triple bill of kindred bands, shielding tender feelings in muscular, noisy rock, skipping lead-guitar solos to get to the next riff or accusation.   Bob Mould, who leads Sugar, helped invent the style with Husker Du in the 1980's. After an interlude as a solo performer, using gentler arrangements, he returned to the power-trio lineup with Sugar.

But because of events that occurred 10 years ago, when Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards and mobs of her supporters reacted by killing Sikhs in Delhi and other cities, Mr. Bhagat is believed to be in great danger.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"To Black Audience in Brooklyn, Mayor Promotes Austerity Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/to-black-audience-in-brooklyn-mayor-promotes-austerity-plan.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

At a time when many Iraqis are destitute, Iraq has not only repaired the damage allied bombings did to Government palaces during the 1991 war, but is also expanding them and building new ones, according to American intelligence reports.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/metro-digest-820717.html","abstract":"  A SURE BET TURNS OUT TO BE A LOSER   When New York City went into the bookmaking business in 1971, its officials envisioned that their monopoly franchise would ultimately yield annual profits of $200 million. As it turns out, their projection was off -- by just a little more than $200 million. Like race tracks and other off-track betting operations, the Offtrack Betting Corporation has been losing customers to casinos and state lottery games.

Spoonire, who had beaten Saturday's winner, Villanova's Louie Quinitana (30 minutes 12 seconds), two weeks ago on this same Franklin Park course during the Big East championships, eventually finished in 33d place, too far back to qualify for the N.C.A.A.'s.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Dorothy Dehner Memorial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/arts/dorothy-dehner-memorial.html","abstract":"  A memorial tribute to the sculptor Dorothy Dehner is to take place tonight at 7:30 in the Gallery of the Art Students League, 215 West 57th Street, Manhattan.
