Yet, as even a glancing look at recent outdoor sculpture reveals, the form still flourishes.

In this case, the subject is Haru Reischauer, an Asian-born, Western-educated woman whose interesting bi-cultural life earned her some fame and historical import when her husband, Edwin O. Reischauer, was named American Ambassador to Japan by President John F. Kennedy.   The film begins in 1990, just after her husband's death, the day his ashes are to be ceremonially scattered over the Pacific. In her home in La Jolla, Calif., Mrs. Reischauer (played by Fumi Dan, a lovely 37-year-old Japanese actress, who, in the late-in-life sequences, is caked in truly unpersuasive makeup), is indulging in grief-stricken nostalgia. As quick as you can say Land of the Rising Sun, the film returns to prewar Japan, where Mrs. Reischauer, then known as Haru Matsukata, grew up in a privileged household with a healthy respect for Occidental culture that ran counter to Japan's prevailing nationalism. Sent to college in the United States, somewhat against her will, Haru didn't feel quite at home there, either. And indeed, the film takes as its theme the notion that Haru's life, straddling the Pacific, leaves her feeling like a fish out of water wherever she is. The feeling is naturally exacerbated by World War II and its aftermath.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940826","headline":"Market Place; One Manager's Little Gamble Prompted Big Shift in Stocks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/26/us/market-place-one-manager-s-little-gamble-prompted-big-shift-in-stocks.html","abstract":"  A strategy designed to earn the smallest of profits -- about an extra 1 percent a year -- backfired late Wednesday and played a major role in sending the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 70 points.

We were also confused. Bloomingdale's is open until 7 P.M. on Monday evenings, and the department she was in is covered by sales associates at all times. The department is closed by the executive in charge after 7, the fitting rooms are all checked, the escalators are turned off at 7:30, the cleaning lights are on at 7:45, the telephones do not shut off at night, and the main floor is lighted until 8.    Ms. Ramsey-Read says she came into the store at about 5:30 and got locked in after an hour. Since the store doesn't close until 7, and the activities described above went on until almost 8, I can only conclude she was here later than she thought.   We want all of our customers to be comfortable shopping at Bloomingdale's during regular store hours and have offered to assist Ms. Ramsey-Read in any way possible on her next visit.
