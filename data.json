But perpetually allowing your body to stand or sit in misaligned positions can exact an unpleasant toll on your physical well-being and possibly your social stature.   Body language says a lot to the world about your self-image. A person who stands up straight conveys a message of self-confidence and competence, while someone who stands with slouched shoulders and a sagging gut appears depressed and self-conscious.

First he lost his starting free safety job to Lonnie Young in 1991 and last season he was switched to cornerback, but he couldn't beat out Mike Brim and wound up playing nickelback and on special teams.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Miscalculation, Then Embarrassment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/us/miscalculation-then-embarrassment.html","abstract":"  As Democrats have been forced to negotiate away almost all of President Clinton's package to stimulate the economy, a vexing question has emerged: How did such a small economic initiative turn into such a large political embarrassment?   By holding out for a plan that even Administration economists knew would have modest impact, Mr. Clinton expended much of his early and precious political capital on a proposal that he had never intended to make his biggest fight. And the resulting political defeat has left the Administration vulnerable to future assaults by Republicans, who surprised even themselves by finding unity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930422","headline":"New Jersey Voters Approve 69% of Education Budgets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/nyregion/new-jersey-voters-approve-69-of-education-budgets.html","abstract":"  For the second year in a row, New Jersey voters treated their school districts with relative kindness, approving 69 percent of the local budgets.

Excerpts appear with each article.   WUBNESH HYLTON , 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): Working is not, like, a luxury; it's a necessity. Just like for a college student, you know, going to school only is not reality. You have to work and go to school. That's just the way it is. I pay my rent. I pay my bills, you know. Every once in a while I'm afforded a little luxury, you know, but it's pretty straight-laced.   BERNARDO VASQUEZ , 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): I have responsibilities. Like, my father is a superintendent.  I have to clean the building and stuff like that.  I have to take care of my sisters once in a while. And in the case of the work ethic in the sense of ---- I might not like doing this job.  But I'd better do it well, so I'd better start liking it. Because my father is going to come along and check the corners to see if they're clean. So I'd better start liking it.   WUBNESH I enjoy my work. I just wish it paid more. . . . I don't know if I'll keep with it.  . . . It pays the bills, but it doesn't allow you to have any fun and put something in the bank, too.   JUAN RIVERA , 18, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): The thing about it is, is on the job, as far as it getting boring for me. And I might move on or something.    WUBNESH There are no jobs. I think young people want money. And a lot of young people are willing to work for it. But, again, young people want glamorous jobs. They want to work in the Gap. They don't want to work in McDonald's.   JUAN The other reason that a lot of young people don't go out and get jobs is that they don't know how to represent themselves. They might go in with these jeans, you know, untied shoes. . . . And they might not know what to say. They come in, like, \"What's up?\" you know? And they don't know how to represent themselves or something like that in an interview.    WUBNESH When you're younger, identity is something that you have to show. When you get older, identity becomes a part of you, and no matter what you wear, you know who you are. So, when you get older, you put aside your ego with that Champion sweat shirt or whatever.  And you get done with a T-shirt. You know, a suit and stuff. It's not such a big deal anymore.   EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER , 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): Role models really help. I think that might be the most important thing.  If you see somebody who you can relate to, who has gotten somewhere, you know you can get somewhere.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Parcells Isn't Telling the No. 1 Secret","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/sports/pro-football-parcells-isn-t-telling-the-no-1-secret.html","abstract":"  Coach Bill Parcells emerged from his self-described bunker today, brandishing the top pick in the National Football League draft and, as usual, playing it coy.

Three were Czechoslovak, one Austrian; none survived the death camps to which they were sent in 1944 and 1945. The concert, Sunday night at Merkin Hall, gave a close and harrowing sense of the Holocaust's ineradicable calamity: the perishing of a whole musical culture, and the systematic murder of creative souls.   The Theresienstadt camp, established in 1941, served mainly as a holding point for prisoners on their way to the death camps farther east.  It also became a place of temporary confinement for painters, writers and musicians. The Nazis found that the artistic dimension of the camp made for good propaganda, a disguise for atrocities being committed elsewhere. They concocted an absurd film -- \"Hitler Presents the Jews With a City\" -- in which Theresienstadt metamorphosed into a bustling, culturally active village. A Jewish organization was allowed to put on a concert series that included chamber, choral and orchestral music, even several operas. Composers did not work in defiance of the regime, but beneath its lethal gaze; it was a diabolical period of grace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Yanks Wreck Eck Again To Topple the A's in 9th","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/sports/baseball-yanks-wreck-eck-again-to-topple-the-a-s-in-9th.html","abstract":"  The Yankees conquered Dennis Eckersley again tonight, but this time Steve Farr and the Yankee bullpen did their jobs.

It is centred on the main road between Eltham and Woolwich, on which many shops and businesses are located. Several major A roads including the South Circular Road and A2 road pass through the area, as does a railway line, serving Eltham station which is located in Well Hall. The Postcode that covers Well Hall and most of the Eltham area is SE9, and the 020 dialing covers the entire Royal Borough of Greenwich. Well Hall is split across two electoral wards, Eltham West on the west side of Well Hall Road, and Eltham North on the east side of Well Hall Road.

One of the masters of both forms of conflict was Christoph Willibald Gluck, whose 1779 opera \"Iphigenie en Tauride\" was performed on Wednesday night at the Manhattan School of Music. This production, directed by James Robinson, also yearns to take a role in contemporary debates about operatic presentation, though it does so with far less coherence than did Gluck.    Gluck's impact on the evolution of opera was immense, and he made the issues clear from the very beginning of this elegantly dramatic work. He was opposed to the Italian style in which florid display of a singer's abilities could become an ornament to mythic tales.

A) Robert Smith is home-grown -- born in Cleveland, grew up in nearby Euclid, was named the state's high school player of the year as a junior and senior and in 1990 broke Archie Griffin's freshman rushing record at Ohio State. A history major with an emphasis in a pre-med curriculm, he is as articulate and intelligent as he is talented at tailback, where he displays long, loping strides and beautiful breakaway speed. He quit the Ohio State football team in 1991 over an assistant coach's insistence that he miss classes for football practice, he said. He returned to the team last season, led it in rushing and is now projected as a first-round pick in the National Football League draft on Sunday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930423","headline":"For Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/arts/for-children.html","abstract":"  Queens Zoo   53-51 111th Street  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  (718) 271-7761  Recommended for all ages    The first thing you come upon at the Queens Zoo is the marsh, where the large pond ripples with the activity of ducks, sandhill cranes, swans, herons, egrets and Canada geese.

Nzombe Munyoro and his wife were so happy they just stood in their empty parched fields and let the water soak them. And when month after month the rains kept coming, the 54-year-old farmer, who had lost his 18 cattle to starvation and had not even seen seeds sprout in his fields for over a year, planted maize and cotton and watched it grow, finally convinced his family would survive.   In Zimbabwe, one of the countries hardest hit by the drought, the advent of this year's wet season brought more than just a sigh of relief from farmers, cattle ranchers, businessmen and Government officials. After the year-long drought, which required the importation of millions of tons of food for most of East and Southern Africa, the rain in this largely agricultural country was greeted almost as a miracle, a reprieve from the brink of disaster.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930423","headline":"The Giants Stay Warm by Running Around the Bases","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/sports/baseball-the-giants-stay-warm-by-running-around-the-bases.html","abstract":"  The Mets have found their gear, and it is neutral.
