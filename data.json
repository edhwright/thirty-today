Mrs. Evers-Williams's challenges are formidable, but she has several advantages. One is her deep personal tie to a civil rights group whose history is its most sacred asset. She is the widow of Medgar Evers, a truly heroic figure in the Southern civil rights movement. She worked at her husband's side in that lonely and dangerous outpost of justice, the Jackson, Miss., field office of the N.A.A.C.P.

Using modern laboratory methods, chemists have recently identified more than 600 carotenoids in plants, including about 40 that are prominent in common fruits and vegetables. Beta carotene has long been the focus of attention for three main reasons: it makes up about one-quarter of edible carotenoids, it is the one that is most efficiently converted in the body into vitamin A and it is a powerful antioxidant that may block free radical damage to cell membranes and body chemicals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950221","headline":"Islanders' Big Effort Spoiled by a Fluke Overtime Goal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/sports/hockey-islanders-big-effort-spoiled-by-a-fluke-overtime-goal.html","abstract":"  After playing one of their best games of the season and coming from behind to force overtime, the Islanders lost tonight by 3-2 to the Montreal Canadiens in a thriller at the Forum.

Define the Issue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/us/anti-crime-bill-as-political-dispute-president-and-gop-define-the-issue.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 Most Americans think that having more police officers on the streets is a good way to fight crime. So do most police officers and both political parties. So why, in the recent House debate over crime legislation, did the matter of providing more police become the central dispute and the magnet that drew President Clinton's first explicit threat to veto a bill?   The basic dynamic driving the legislation that emerged from the House last week was this: Mr. Clinton and the Democrats swiped the crime issue from the Republicans. Then the Republicans got it back, not by any bold move but by relentless criticism of the 1994 anti-crime legislation. With last November's elections having left the Democrats in disarray on virtually every front, the President now finds himself fighting desperately to reclaim the issue. - Tony Blankley, press secretary for Speaker Newt Gingrich, summed up the Democrats' situation by quoting an old American position on the Panama Canal: \"You can't take it from us, because we stole it fair and square.\"   Never mind that many criminologists believe that crime cannot be fought with Federal legislation. Never mind that previous efforts from Washington have generally been considered ineffective.   For Republicans, the crime issue has been theirs almost by birthright. It was only when a Democratic candidate for President finally said, as Mr. Clinton did in 1992, that he favored the death penalty -- and allowed the execution of a brain-damaged man to go forward before the New Hampshire primary -- that the Republicans began to lose the issue.   Public opinion polls in January 1994 showed crime overtaking the economy as the biggest perceived problem facing the nation. And for the first time, voters thought Democrats and Republicans could handle it equally well.   Since then, the President has signed into law some popular crime-fighting measures. These include a ban on assault weapons and a three-strikes-and-you're-out provision that imposes life sentences on criminals convicted of a Federal crime after two previous convictions.   The Republicans, who can read polls as well as anyone, did not challenge either the ban or the three-strikes proposal in their Contract With America, their 1994 campaign manifesto.   Nor did the contract directly challenge another major element of last year's anti-crime law -- Mr. Clinton's pledge to put 100,000 additional police officers on the street.   The contract's main thrust on crime was to build more prisons, make prisoners serve longer sentences, prevent criminals from getting off on technicalities and cut the prevention programs that Democrats had stuffed into last year's bill.   While there are deep philosophical differences between the parties over how to fight crime, Republicans in the House did not really object to the Democrats' desire to hire more police officers. Indeed, the contract called for \"additional law enforcement,\" an acknowledgment that this was a good idea.   But they saw the President's pledge for 100,000 new officers as dishonest, saying the bill would not come close to paying for that many and would provide communities with only seed money for five years. They also argued that some communities did not need or want more officers, and that the legislation should have concentrated the new officers in high-crime areas. And they portrayed the prevention programs as wasteful social spending.   So the contract collapsed last year's money for police and prevention into a lump sum, or block grant, of $10 billion over five years for local communities to fight crime any way they deemed fit, including the hiring of more police officers.   Over the last two weeks, this provision became the most contentious in the new crime bill, eclipsing other divisive matters that had blocked agreement on crime legislation for nearly a decade. These included measures to allow officers to make searches without warrants and to speed up carrying out executions, in part by ordering Federal courts to defer to state courts.   The Republican changes brought protests from some liberals and some lawyers, who said the changes were a direct assault on fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. (The Republicans even voted down an amendment, proposed by the Democrats, that contained the exact language of the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unlawful searches.)   But for the most part, the Republican changes sailed through the House. Even Mr. Clinton, who once taught constitutional law, did not put up a fuss.   The fact is that these constitutional safeguards are political losers with a public fed up with criminals getting off on technicalities and tired of waiting years for executions to be carried out. Being against them would put Mr. Clinton on the wrong, \"old Democrat\" side of crime.   He made his stand instead on the 100,000 new officers and, for the first time in his White House tenure, he pledged to use the veto against a specific piece of legislation. It was, after all, one of the most visible of his campaign promises to become law, and to retreat on it now would have been unthinkable.   \"It's one of his few popular accomplishments,\" said a Democratic aide in Congress. \"If he lost that it would be a major blow. The White House has probably already cut their commercials for '96 on the 100,000 cops.\"   Even Republicans concede, if backhandedly, that the veto threat on the police issue worked to the President's advantage.   \"They run an Administration by survey research,\" said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. And the research shows that governors, mayors and voters believe that more police officers on the beat, along with keeping criminals in prison for their full sentences, is the most effective way to fight crime.\"   Since the November elections, the Administration has been searching for ways to reassert itself. The crime issue, which Mr. Clinton had turned to his advantage before, provides a logical opportunity.   \"There was a feeling that the best way to differentiate himself from the opposition was to make positive pronouncements and to draw lines in the sand,\" said the Democratic aide. \"There was a feeling that he hadn't done a particularly good job with either, and there has been pressure on him to pick a couple of battles.\"   While the Democrats lost the vote in the House on protecting money for the additional police officers, they had other reasons to rejoice: a vote on a separate amendment indicated that they had the numbers to block any attempt to override a veto.   Moreover, the Democrats appeared to have won the war of words. They were able to frame the debate so that it looked as if the Republicans were eliminating 100,000 police officers -- even though they believed their own bill would provide for more officers than the Clinton measure would if local governments chose to spend all of the money on additional police.   And the veto threat, strengthened by the strong support from House Democrats, also translated quickly into hints of accommodation from Republicans in the Senate, where the bills will be taken up next month.   The Senate seems likely to be more accommodating than the House anyway. Some Republican senators do not like block grants for the same reason that House Republicans once opposed them: the money can easily be diverted from its intended purpose.   But the politics could still prove tricky for Mr. Clinton. The Senate could eliminate money for the 100,000 police officers but send the President an otherwise tough anti-crime package in a single bill.   Mr. Blankley, the Gingrich spokesman, said it would be a bad idea for Mr. Clinton to veto such a measure.   \"The way information gets communicated to a general audience is not in multiple paragraphs, but in snippets of headlines, and I don't think he and his party are currently positioned to win in that snippet-information process,\" Mr. Blankley said. \"If he seems to be fighting the Republicans on crime, most people would correctly assume he's wrong. It's been a Republican issue for over 100 years. It's counterintuitive to think that the head of the Democratic Party is tougher.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950221","headline":"Tribute to Robin Williams","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/movies/tribute-to-robin-williams.html","abstract":"  The American Museum of the Moving Image is to honor Robin Williams at its 10th annual tribute Thursday night at the Waldorf-Astoria.

Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket, which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19950221","time":"1995-02-21

Because we now live in an age when governments are basically broke, the only way for most countries to raise cash for development is either to enforce savings at home or attract investors from the world's major bond markets. Moody's is the credit rating agency that signals the electronic herd of global investors where to plunk down their money, by telling them which countries' bonds are blue-chip and which are junk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/style/chronicle-869095.html","abstract":"  The winners of the 1995 Matrix Award given by New York Women in Communications for exceptional accomplishment have been announced.

As I report in \"An Eye for an Eye,\" the camps in Poland in 1945 weren't for Nazis but for German civilians, of whom less than 1 percent were ever indicted as Nazis. Many were children.   You refer to a review of \"An Eye for an Eye\" by the German critic Eike Geisel. Mr. Geisel wrote that I come from \"the school of sadistic sensationalism,\" and to prove it he quoted parts of the German edition of \"An Eye for an Eye.\" But neither I nor my German translator ever wrote what Mr. Geisel quoted. Incredibly, Mr. Geisel himself rewrote a part of the German edition to convey a sadistic sensationalism that he then attributed to me.   Many camp commandants in Poland (and nearly all the directors in Warsaw) were Jews, and Mr. Geisel wrote that my message is \"Jews equal Nazis,\" is Jewish and Nazi criminals are \"mirror images.\" That isn't my message at all.   I specifically write in \"An Eye for an Eye\" that the Jews and Nazis \"of course . . . hadn't done the same things at all,\" and that I would never contend that the Jews and the Germans \"were equivalent, even morally.\"   Instead, I write of Jews like Zlata, Moshe, Mania and Pola, who refused to look at, much less to work at, the Polish camps. I write of Jews like Shlomo Singer, who at the risk of his life told people who tortured the Germans, \"You must stop doing this,\" and of Jews like Lola Potok, a commandant, who at first took revenge on the Germans but then, at the risk of her life, protected them, even smuggled them food.    At the end of \"An Eye for an Eye,\" I write, \"I do believe it's a story of Jewish redemption.\"   Again incredibly, Mr. Geisel isn't a right-wing but left-wing critic, though surely the German right wing is now parroting him and saying that Jews equal Nazis. It is tragic that \"An Eye for an Eye\" is not being published in Germany now and that Germans have nowhere to learn the truth.

Some tough-smart-hip-attractive woman, played by somebody like Lauren Bacall or Emma Thompson, falls in with a tough-smart-hip-attractive man, played by somebody like Humphrey Bogart or Sean Connery. Fate throws them together in an extreme situation like a war or a jungle research project. Inevitably she is younger and less experienced, but -- in the eyes of the crusty misogynist at her side -- her biggest handicap is that she is a woman.   She is plucky, smart, vulnerable yet competent. At some point, in a moment of extreme duress when even Bogart-Connery has reached his limits -- the Nazis have them pinned down, the food has run out, the volcano is erupting, the ship is about to sink -- she comes up with an idea that pulls them through.

Newspapers in France and in Britain reported today that a senior intelligence officer in the Algerian Army was shot to death with two bodyguards and his driver on Sunday in an Algiers suburb. There was no official confirmation of the killing, but he would be the highest-ranking officer to be slain by militants since a military-backed coup set off an Islamic revolt there three years ago.   Islamic militants have also taken responsibility for blowing up three vital bridges in and around Algiers and killing at least 11 well-known figures in the arts and civil affairs in the last week. Among them were the director of the national theater; a composer of rai, an Arab music with a fast beat; and a leader of the feminist movement.   So far the oil industry, crucial to the country's flagging economy, has been spared. But diplomats and experts on Algerian affairs say the security situation seems to be spinning out of control, raising the prospect of an all-out guerrilla war involving big armed clashes across the country, including the capital.   European governments -- particularly that of France, which as Algeria's former colonial ruler has a large population of North Africans -- are expressing nervousness and confusion over the rapid deterioration in security. France's President, Francois Mitterrand, urged the Government this month to negotiate with the help of European mediators, but the Algerian leadership rebuffed that notion as outside interference in its affairs.   Diplomats say the ouster of Algeria's military-dominated Government could profoundly undermine the Governments of neighboring Morocco and Tunisia, leaving Europe to face a phalanx of Islamic states just across the Mediterranean modeled politically after Iran.    Europeans also fear the possibility of an influx of frightened middle-class North African migrants averse to the idea of living under Islamic rule.   Underlining those worries, Algerian militants carried out a virtually unparalleled raid on a border post in neighboring Tunisia last week, killing seven guards. The Armed Islamic Group, one of the most violent of the Algerian factions, took responsibility for that attack today.   In tracts distributed in Algiers, the group said the cross-border raid was a \"warning\" to Tunisia's staunchly secular Government to \"stop helping the enemies of Islam.\"   The violent revolt in Algeria began in early 1992, after a military-backed Government seized power and canceled a final round of elections that the Islamic movement seemed sure of winning. The new leadership banned the Islamic political movement and imposed severe limits on civil freedoms like public gatherings and writings critical of the Government.   Since then, clashes between secularists and Islamic militants have taken at least 30,000 lives, with security officers, Government officials, foreigners and, now, secular cultural figures among the main targets.   But the death toll last week, which began to surface in Algerian newspaper reports only today, represents a striking acceleration of the attacks.    French and Algerian analysts said the number killed last week exceeded 500 people, including militants, soldiers, urban civilians and Berbers in the mountainous Kabyl region in the north, where opposition to the fundamentalist campaign is strong.   The latest spate of large-scale attacks in the capital began with a suicide bombing on Jan. 30 near a police headquarters downtown that killed 42 people and wounded 256, mostly innocent civilians and pedestrians.   Often it takes several days to piece together events in Algeria. Few foreign journalists operate there because of the threat to their safety, and the Algerian Government often withholds information on rebel attacks and military operations.   The senior military officer reported killed on Sunday was Col. Mrawi Jilali, a ranking army intelligence officer responsible for issuing reports to the public and news organizations. According to several Algerian officials, he was one of the closest aides to the intelligence division's chief, Gen. Tewfik Madani, whose movements are a closely guarded secret.   The killing suggested that the fundamentalists are refining their sources of information and their infiltration of circles of the country's top leadership. Opposition figures said Colonel Jilali was under surveillance for three days before the shooting in the Kouba district, on the edge of the capital.   In December, Islamic militants took their war to France, hijacking an Air France jetliner from Algiers to Marseilles and killing three passengers before French commandos stormed the plane and killed the hijackers.    For the French Government, the most alarming aspect of the hijacking may be that intelligence officials now suspect that Iran helped instigate it .   In an article this week in the French weekly Paris Match, a former journalist and novelist, Gerard de Villiers, reports that French intelligence officials are saying that Iran has linked up with Islamic militants in Algeria \"on an operational level,\" lending advice and support.   Mr. de Villiers quotes French anti-terrorist intelligence officials as saying that early in December, weeks before the Christmas Eve hijacking began, Iran's minister of secret and intelligence services, Ali Fallahian, met with representatives of the Islamic Armed Group, the Palestinian organization Hamas and the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon known as the Party of God. All three groups are militantly Islamic in their orientation and receive advice and financial backing from Iran.   Mr. de Villiers wrote that French intelligence agents were tipped off about the meeting, which took place in Tripoli, Lebanon, by Syrian counterparts who watch Lebanon carefully.    Until recently, French intelligence believed that Algerian militants received some training in Iran and in the Sudan and some financial support. But the meeting in Lebanon appears to have taken relations to a higher level.   Last month, France's confusion over what to do about Algeria was evident. President Mitterrand's call for talks between militants and the army to end the conflict broke with a French policy of supporting the Algerian Government in its effort to eradicate militants. Mr. Mitterrand was immediately contradicted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who said the war was an internal Algerian affair.   Nonetheless, the attacks on vital targets in Algiers have shaken confidence among French officials that the Algerian military can still control the situation in the country of 30 million, where unemployment runs close to 40 percent. The economic misery helps the militants' drive to recruit volunteers to overthrow the Government.   Among the three vital bridges blown up in and around the capital in the last two days was one linking a neighborhood where the army headquarters and main armed forces hospital are located.   Any lingering hopes that the Government might renew a bid for negotiations with jailed leaders of the Islamic opposition have faded somewhat with reports in a London-based daily that the movement's leader, Abassi Madani, who was moved from house arrest to a military jail this month, has undergone an operation to remove a serious cancerous growth from his gums or jaw. The Algerian Government has not confirmed the report, which appeared in the Arabic-language paper Asharq Al Awsat.   Mr. Madani was moved from house arrest to a military jail earlier this month. It is not clear under what conditions he has been held following the surgery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/nyregion/news-summary-901195.html","abstract":"  International A2-9  AGREEMENT ON MEXICAN AID  The United States and Mexico agreed on a $20 billion rescue plan for Mexico.

These two pianists make an interesting pair: the one a young musician eager to make an old tradition his own; the other a figure with a direct link to the late-19th-century world through his studies with Egon Petri, the star pupil of Busoni. In technical terms, Mr. Johannesen could not compete with his younger colleague. He has trouble producing a full sound, and his technique is no longer flawless. His rendition of the Franck sounded muted and fragile in comparison with Mr. Kissin's gorgeous surge of tone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950222","headline":"State Universities Reshaped In the Era of Budget Cutting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/us/state-universities-reshaped-in-the-era-of-budget-cutting.html","abstract":"  With the nation's new emphasis on cutting taxes and curbing government spending, governors and legislatures are reducing the budgets of state university systems and, in the process, forcing the most radical reshaping of public higher education since its rapid growth in the 1960's.

Calling the action a first installment on their promise to balance the budget by 2002, Republicans approved cuts in job training and education, assistance to homeless youths and veterans, foreign aid to Russian republics, money for United Nations peacekeeping operations and Federal subsidies to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. - If they stand, the cuts approved by five subcommittees today -- and those to be made by eight other panels in the next few days -- will eliminate many of the social programs that conservatives have criticized as wasteful and redundant.   But the Democrats, with President Clinton in the forefront, have already begun to fight back, and many of the midyear cuts in the 1995 fiscal year budget are expected to run into resistance in the Senate, which will not take them up until the House has completed its work.   After a strategy session with Democrats on Capitol Hill today, Mr. Clinton emerged to lambaste the Republicans for a proposal to replace the Federal school lunch program in the budget for the 1996 fiscal year with block grants to the states, calling it \"a terrible mistake.\"   The most influential of the subcommittees -- Labor, Health, Human Services and Education -- proposed cutting $4.3 billion, affecting 142 programs, including 84 that were marked for elimination.   Among them were dozens of youth-training and education programs, like the Clinton Administration's Goals 2000, which sets national standards for secondary education. The Republicans would also reduce the $3.5 billion Head Start program by $105 million, eliminate $1.3 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program that provides fuel oil to the needy and would mark for termination a host of grants, like the National Science Scholars ($4.4 million) and the Javits Fellowships ($7.5 million).   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting's $285.6 million budget was not marked for cuts this year, but in 1996 its budget would be cut by 15 percent, or $47 million, with an additional $94 million, or 30 percent of its current budget, pared in 1997. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said, \"It represents the first whack in what the Speaker has said will be the total elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950223","headline":"A Chance for Peace in Ireland","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/23/opinion/a-chance-for-peace-in-ireland.html","abstract":"  The Governments of Ireland and Britain have taken a bold step toward peace in Northern Ireland.

Ms. York's \"Rapture,\" performed on Sunday afternoon at the Juilliard Theater, also allowed the dancers to be their eager young selves, and they looked as if they were having the time of their lives.    Set on an often dimly lighted stage with a field of stars behind, \"Rapture\" was ingeniously plotted, with moments of dreamlike stillness and melancholy punctuating the dancers' race across the stage. The ways Ms. York interspersed brief solos, many of them by corps dancers, were also interesting. But overall, as it hurtled toward its end, \"Rapture\" came to seem like a one-note display of energy and oddity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950223","headline":"5 Americans Are Called Spies By France and Told to Leave","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/23/world/5-americans-are-called-spies-by-france-and-told-to-leave.html","abstract":"PARIS, Feb. 22 France has accused five Americans, including the former C.I.A. station chief here and his deputy, of political and economic espionage and asked them to leave the country immediately, French officials said today.   The other Americans who were asked to leave were two other C.I.A. agents, who are listed in diplomatic jobs on the roster of the United States Embassy, and a woman working as an undercover C.I.A. agent who lacks diplomatic status, according to an article published today in Le Monde and confirmed by diplomats. - The Americans were accused of trying to bribe high-ranking French Government officials into disclosing France's negotiating position on movies and entertainment in recent global trade talks, secrets about French domestic politics, and telecommunications.   The spectacle of one ally publicly demanding the withdrawal of another's diplomats for spying plunged relations between France and the United States into one of the strangest crises of their history.

If the French accounts are correct, at least the agency was spying on something that matters, specifically French efforts in 1993 to block an international trade agreement and to thwart the marketing of American movies and television shows in France. At a time when American national security is increasingly defined by economic interests, it is reassuring to see the lumbering intelligence apparatus in Washington turning away from the obsolete work of monitoring Russian military forces.    But the methods reportedly involved, including efforts to bribe French officials, were wrong.
