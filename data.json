In the study, done by a group of European scientists, larvae that would ordinarily have become small \"minor workers\" instead developed into much larger soldiers. The change was set  off by the presence of potential invaders of the same species. And adult worker  ants seem to have put the genetic maneuver into effect by changing the food supply of developing larvae to alter the hormonal balance.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Science"},{"date":"19960220","headline":"Closing Arguments In Menendez
