In his State of the City speech this week, Mayor Dinkins announced yet another plan.    Election year dynamics require that something useful be done with the money. The courts have found City Hall in contempt for mismanagement. Voters demand better answers. The Mayor desperately needs to show progress.

News analysis, Page 1.  NEW OWNER'S TOUR OF INSPECTION   The new owner of The Daily News, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, made his appearance among the paper's blue-collar workers at the tabloid's Brooklyn plant the night before the newspaper officially became his. \"It's amazing,\" he said repeatedly as he gazed at his newest $36.3 million acquisition. Page 1.  OLIVE BRANCH OFFERED TO NEWS STAFF   The new owner assumed control of The Daily News with an olive branch for the news staff he had decimated in an economy measure and a firm pledge to restore his new, $36.3 million property to its glory days. Page 26.  DINKINS'S AIDES WEIGHED FOR U.S. JOBS   Four of Mayor Dinkins's chief social policy advisers, including Andrew M. Cuomo, who headed his commission on homelessness, are in the running for high-ranking jobs in the Clinton Administration, officials said. Page 27.  OFFICIAL LEFT NOTEBOOK AFTER DEATH   In the month before his body was found in an Albany motel room, a beleaguered Bronx school district superintendent filled a notebook with complaints about educational policies in the city, law-enforcement officials said.

REGION   CHANGE ASKED IN BORROWING   Every year, New York State faces another yawning budget gap. And every year, it comes up with another creative financing maneuver to balance its books. But, to the cautious praise of fiscal watchdogs, Governor Cuomo proposed changing the way the state structures its long-term borrowing. Page 28.

One sign of this groping is the very date of the letter -- more than a month after Mr. Clinton's election. The delay reflects a fundamental disagreement between the church and the new Administration over an issue that has generated more than its share of discord over the years: abortion.

The schemes have given New York State a reputation for off-budget financial legerdemain and saddled the state with one of the lowest credit ratings in the country. But on Wednesday, to the cautious praise of fiscal watchdogs who have long criticized his borrowing practices, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed changing the way the state does its long-term borrowing.  No More Sleight of Hand    Under the proposal, quasi-governmental authorities like the Urban Development Corporation would no longer be able to float bonds to build things they were never intended to build, like prisons.

His memorial piece -- revived by the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night -- was intended for Mstislav Rostropovich, who in 1968 ran into trouble with the Soviet authorities and was unable to travel to Edmonton, Alberta, to play the premiere. The central event, the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had happened earlier that year.   Mr. Morawetz's piece is a kind of oratorio without words in which cello solos and a stringless orchestra -- all winds, brass and percussion -- depict violent death and mourning and intermittently comment on it. The tone is pessimistic in a particularly 20th-century way. Tragedy equals catastrophe; mourning becomes hopelessness without redemption. Brass and timpani are by turns angry and ominous. The cello part emanates in a liquid baritonal legato; the composer has gone out of his way to oblige a player with a big tone and expansive personality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930109","headline":"Rutgers Feels Cuts, but President Won't Cry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/09/nyregion/rutgers-feels-cuts-but-president-won-t-cry.html","abstract":"  Dr. Francis L.

The leading faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has shattered, pointing the way to a realignment that could eventually bring an American-style two-party system. For a time, political infighting could make it harder for Tokyo to deliver on diplomatic deals. In the longer run, democratic competition would be good for Japan, and the U.S.    Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most formidable younger politician and its most fiercely ambitious, forced the split. After building his career as the protege of Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced \"godfather\" of Japanese factional politics, Mr. Ozawa has now cleverly, if cynically, reinvented himself as the champion of political reform.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930109","headline":"John P.W.

The fisherfolk in the village had gone out early that day, snagged what they wanted and upon returing had dumped their catch into a tall oil barrel.

But putting on a show in London is still cheaper than it is in New York, and ticket prices reflect that.   Thanks, too, to the stronger dollar (about $1.55 to the pound at the end of December), theater tickets are once again good buys for American tourists. While the cheapest ticket for the musical \"Five Guys Named Moe\" in New York is $15, some balcony seats for the same show in London, where it originated, are as little as $4.65. It is playing at the Lyric Theater. The top ticket for \"Cats\" in London costs $43.40, while the top seats for the show in New York are $65. Those prices do not include booking fees -- levied both by ticket agencies and also by some theaters themselves for phone reservations -- which raise the ante considerably. Tickets bought through the New York office of the British company Edwards & Edwards (1 Times Square Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10036;  [ 212 ]  944-0290), for instance, will be marked up by 20 percent; there will also be a service charge of $6 a ticket.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Report Details Variations in Police Review Boards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/nyregion/report-details-variations-in-police-review-boards.html","abstract":"  As New York City prepares to institute an all-civilian review board to monitor complaints against the police, a report released yesterday by the New York Civil Liberties Union found that similar agencies throughout the country operate with significant barriers.

All were designed to remove what she considered to be structural impediments to learning among her students, 57 percent of whom are black and 5 percent Asian, mostly Laotians, and 70 percent of whom come from one-parent, blue-collar families in a town where many adults never graduated from high school and unemployment is high. \n\nSome of those impediments, Mrs. Deaton says, were rules and policies that were too rigid or impractical for her school. Other obstacles derived from the home lives of students, many of whom have never been read to by a parent. Together they produced an environment that was antagonistic toward children, she says.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Kristin Williams, Stephen Mugford","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/style/weddings-kristin-williams-stephen-mugford.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. James W.

So \"The Naughty Nude,\" a cheerful, unpretentious, low-key show at Gallery 292 in SoHo (through Jan. 16), is a gaggle of coquettes, some in brassieres or petticoats, none in jockey shorts. The operative term for these 19th- and 20th-century come-ons is indeed \"naughty.\" Though there are warrantied works of art among these 60-odd photographs -- a 1950's Bill Brandt, Andre Kertesz's \"Satiric Dancer\" (who has mysteriously strayed in in a dress) -- the atmosphere tends to the kitsch, the camp and the cozy.   In French postcards, women with bare bottoms smile at themselves in mirrors; others strip down so they can enjoy a cigarette to the full. A Ziegfeld girl named Gladys Glad poses in a shawl of gauze and lace that exposes everything the censor would allow. The gallery claims that a group of turn-of-the-century nudes by Albert Penot are in the tradition of Delacroix and Degas -- but let the viewer be the judge. If pornography is explicit and art is genteel, then these familiar types of ads and postcards and other staples of the titillation trade fall somewhere in between.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"19 Contaminated By Nuclear Leak","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/us/19-contaminated-by-nuclear-leak.html","abstract":"  A leak of radioactive material has contaminated workers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and officials asked Friday that the families of some of the workers be tested for radiation exposure.

Here, tourist shops and boutiques outnumber even churches. To find the perfect Venetian keepsake requires some serious looking beyond display windows jammed with handcrafted trinkets and baubles, leather and paper goods, antiques and glass objects of every description, jewels and costume jewelry and of course the ubiquitous mask. One marvels at the sheer number of these shops all seemingly selling the same things. But then a closer look reveals that they are not all alike, that here and there are shops selling their own fine stock, where talented Venetian artisans are preserving the jeweled world of Veronese and Titian. The trick is to find them. \n\nThe problem for the ardent shopper in search of a serious purchase is that there is no one street dedicated to shopping, with the possible exception of the Via Frezzeria near St. Mark's Square. At 1691 Via Frezzeria, for example, Mirella Spinella's boutique, called simply M Antichita (telephone 5235666), is one of the city's most elegant. A look through the large window reveals an amazing assortment of fine antique furniture, paintings and bibelots. A handsome 18th-century desk or an antique silver box provides the background for the luxurious hand-blocked velvet cloaks and cushions the owner designs. (Cushions sell for about $100 (prices calculated at 1,400 lire to the dollar); full-length fur-trimmed cloaks go up to $1,500. The exquisite jewelry fashioned by another young Venetian artisan, Monica Zecchi, completes the picture of Venetian opulence. The Zecchi pieces in the shop's window are not for low budgets: An antique gold pendant embellished by tourmalines, hanging from a heavy gold chain, is obviously a one-of-a-kind piece designed by a skilled craftsman. Zecchi's necklaces show an imaginative use of semiprecious stones such as garnets, rose quartz and lapis lazuli set in gold; they start at around $1,800. Made-to-order pieces combining rubies, sapphires or emeralds sell for as much as $11,000. Even if you're not planning any large expenditures, this is a place worth seeing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Judith Seibert, Gary R.

We may also hope that, before too long, Russia will emerge from its agonies and set itself on the road to a better future.

Their work sowed the seeds for a radical transformation of painting, the meaning of which is still being explored by artists today. In COLLAGE, ASSEMBLAGE, AND THE FOUND OBJECT (Abrams, $85), Diane Waldman follows the unfolding of collage as both a medium and a process in art, from Cubism and Dada through the work of such different artists as Vladimir Tatlin, Richard Hamilton and David Wojnarowicz. The author, the deputy director and senior curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, notes how the distinctions between found object and painting have blurred, as in the work of Anselm Kiefer, who incorporates items such as lead, straw and clothes into grim, monumental works about human destiny and guilt. In a new twist on the found object, artists like Sherrie Levine incorporate reproductions of previous masterpieces into their own creations. Finally, Ms. Waldman proposes that the connections between art and life suggested by the first collagists have deepened, with artworks being treated not as sacred relics but as part of the mishmash of the ordinary world from which, as Duchamp suggested, it is possible not just to create art but also simply to \n\nsee \n\nit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/books/c-corrections-266493.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Dec. 13 with a review of \"Kurt Weill: Composer in a Divided World\" included an erroneous identification, from the book, for an actor in the 1943 production of \"One Touch of Venus.\" He was John Boles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"MORRISTOWN JOURNAL;\nCommunity Up in Arms Over Plan for New Jail","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/nyregion/morristown-journal-community-up-in-arms-over-plan-for-new-jail.html","abstract":"MORRISTOWN'S jail, built to hold 145 inmates, now averages 300.

Leon Botstein, in his first three concerts as music director of the American Symphony Orchestra, fashioned programs on interdisciplinary themes, largely devoid of familiar music; his musicianship did not quite live up to the richness of his aims, and blame naturally fell on him.   Shortcomings were easily found in the first half of the season. The American Symphony does not have a sumptuous tone, and the conductor is no virtuoso. Performances sometimes lost momentum, and power was restored in crude climaxes. Mr. Botstein distracted himself and the audience with breathless, overstated pronouncements between works: \"There's really something very    dangerous    about this piece,\" he said several times.

All undergraduates must now take one course that examines a non-European culture, a second that addresses issues of race, religion and ethnicity in America and a third that explores issues of gender roles and relationships.   Left intact were existing requirements that students take at least one course each in the mathematical sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences; philosophical, social and religious thought; literature and the fine arts. Though the university had previously required students to take a course each in the social sciences and behavioral sciences, it combined these two categories into a single requirement.   \"Like the four basic food groups, to have a balanced intellectual diet you should have a dish from each of these,\" said Peter Duus, a history professor who headed the Undergraduate Studies Committee when it oversaw the curriculum changes.   In part, say faculty members, those changes came about as an acknowledgment of the diversity of Stanford's own student body. Of this year's 1,600 freshmen, 45 percent are Asian, black, Hispanic or American Indian. But in broader terms, the revisions reflect the university's changing view of how best to prepare students for the challenges of today's world.   \"Basic to the general education of an informed citizen of the nation there has to be an understanding of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of our society,\" said Albert Camarillo, a history professor and associate dean of undergraduate studies in the School of Arts and Sciences. \"That is the basic idea.\"   But unlike many colleges, Stanford does not require students to take the same set of courses. To satisfy the world culture requirement, for example, students can choose from among some 30 courses. One Stanford graduate might walk away with an understanding of Zen Buddhism, while another will have a grasp of the contemporary history of Iran.   \"You could probably find under any one area that students will take one of five or six courses,\" Professor Duus said. \"But if you look at a student's transcripts, the only course they will have in common is 'Culture, Ideas and Values.' \"   What is lost in the absence of a shared core of classes, said Carol Schneider, executive vice president of the American Association of Colleges in Washington, is discussion outside the classroom among faculty members and students of the ideas they would all be studying.

Mr. Astin, known to television viewers as Gomez in the \"The Addams Family,\" sings hoarsely and tiptoes around upper notes by means of little shouts, but he bestows a deftly manic approach on his famous opening sequence and has the verbal agility to keep Gilbert's fast-moving patter under control.

The program had been postponed from Dec. 11. The juxtaposition of Church of England theatrics and South American tradition was initially jarring, but the performances had enough conviction to make the combination seem almost logical.   The Britten work is based on the life of the fourth-century bishop Nicolas, a rather fierce and fanatic dispenser of good works whom the modern figure of Santa Claus echoes as faintly as possible. The narration of various miraculous episodes culminates in Nicolas's bringing back to life three boys who had been killed and cooked by an unscrupulous butcher (sort of \"Peter Grimes\" in reverse). While the music is not Britten's finest, it has an immediate ceremonial effectiveness. Mr. Gardner expertly balanced and controlled the various vocal and instrumental forces, even though his chorus did not have an especially polished sound. Stephen Oosting gave powerful, accurate and at times moving renditions of the tenor solos. The audience enthusiastically joined in for two hymns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930111","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/11/nyregion/no-headline-461293.html","abstract":"  \"Half my friends are dead.

Every time Jupiter emerged from a cartoon cloud that opened like an elevator, a bell rang as if the deity were arriving at the ladies' foundations area of a department store. Sometimes the costumes made it seem that way as well: the nymph Pasithea appeared in an outfit that might have been from Frederick's of Hollywood, a bright red garter belt and stocking outfit with a white feather boa and a pair of handcuffs. Jupiter jumped into a bubble bath, apparently in his birthday suit. Even the musicians did not keep their minds on the score.   This was a production of \"Semele\" but hardly the \"Semele\" that Handel's operatic setting gives us with its pastoral scenes and hints of high tragedy. This opera is based on the very same libretto (written by the Restoration dramatist William Congreve) and was completed by the English composer John Eccles in late 1706. It takes the same story from Ovid, of the young girl (Semele) in love with a god (Jupiter); she is tricked by the god's jealous wife (Juno) into demanding to see him in divine form; she dies from the exposure. The composer -- Purcell's heir in the English theater -- never heard the work. It is influenced by Italian opera, with declaimed recitatives and da capo arias, but by the time \"Semele\" was ready for performance, the fashion in London demanded authenticity: operas in Italian from Italy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930111","headline":"Cowboys are Quicker on the Draw","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/11/sports/pro-football-cowboys-are-quicker-on-the-draw.html","abstract":"  Dallas's third touchdown, which gave them a 24-3 lead and put the game all but out of reach, came on a 23-yard run by Emmitt Smith in the third quarter. It came on a draw play that is one of the Cowboys' favorites; that also means they often execute it better than other plays because they enjoy running it. They have used it all season long and in both previous games against Eagles. No doubt Philadelphia had prepared for the play, so the fact that the Cowboys scored on it indicates how well it was executed.    Basically, it's a cutback draw. The Eagles knew this draw would be run but did not recognize it from this formation, which was a formation Dallas had been using in this game but not running the draw play on.
