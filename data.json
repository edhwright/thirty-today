The most inflammatory recommendation by far is that, in carefully defined circumstances, scientists should be able to create embryos solely for research and then destroy them when finished.   That has stirred fears that modern-day Frank-ensteins will soon create, destroy and tinker with life forms just to satisfy their intellectual curiosity. But it strikes this observer that the panel of 19 scientists, ethicists, lawyers and others got the balance just about right. It concluded that the embryo does not have the same moral status as infants or children -- and that research on such embryos holds the potential for great benefit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"Article 924261 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/world/article-924261-no-title.html","abstract":"  Seeking to stem a drop in birth rates that may be the sharpest in modern world history, the government of the eastern German state of Brandenburg has announced that it will pay parents $650 for every new child they have.   \"Eastern Germany's adults appear to have come as close to a temporary suspension of childbearing as any large population in the human experience,\" Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, wrote in a recent study.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"Limiting Welfare -- A special report.; Often-Cited Workfare Effort Provides Cautionary Lessons","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/nyregion/limiting-welfare-special-report-often-cited-workfare-effort-provides-cautionary.html","abstract":"  Sandy Pitt and Sajan Mathew pounded on the door of a shuttered house on Union Avenue.

The Cardinals, according to figures accompanying the tax proposal the clubs gave the players last week as a solution to end the 15-week-old strike, would receive money from the pool even though their revenue would be higher than the revenues of two teams -- Detroit and Oakland -- that would have to share some of their income with supposedly lower-revenue clubs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"Power Struggle Is Delaying Approval of Hospitals Chief","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/nyregion/power-struggle-is-delaying-approval-of-hospitals-chief.html","abstract":"  More than seven months after he was named to head the struggling Westchester County Medical Center, Edward A.

Allen got some halftime advice from the injured tackle Erik Williams, Garrett got back to the game plan and the Cowboys ripped off 36 points -- the most in a second half in the team's history -- to beat the Packers by 42-31.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"The View From Anne Boleyn's Window, Including the Bad Bounces","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/sports/IHT-the-view-from-anne-boleyns-window-including-the-bad-bounces.html","abstract":"I must admit to worrying that the game might be stuffy and self- defeating. .\"Imagine this is a church wall in a French or English medieval town,\" said the organizer, Richard Adams, pointing to the indoor court below..It's easy to imagine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"St. John's Milestone (Victory 10) Not an Easy One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/sports/notebook-football-st-john-s-milestone-victory-10-not-an-easy-one.html","abstract":"  St. John's (10-1) achieved its most victories ever in a football season by hanging on to defeat Pace, 20-13, yesterday at Red Storm Field in Jamaica, Queens.

His pictures can seem at a superficial glance mundane, even artless. On the whole, they speak to nothing so much as peace, stability and the quiet meditation on everyday life beyond 19th-century London, a life that can seem very remote to American viewers today. The extravagant paintings of his compatriot and contemporary, Turner, more readily conform to our 20th-century idea of advanced art as idiosyncratic and abstract.   But the simplicity of Constable's work is misleading. On the one hand, there are his famous cloud studies, big oil sketches and some of the late paintings, where pigment is put down with a freedom that can bring to mind the Impressionists. (The French, not coincidentally, admired him before the English did, and more than they did Turner.) And on the other hand, there are the excessively labored pictures Constable painted to win acceptance at the Royal Academy in London. The former are groundbreaking, the latter conformist, and it is this split that makes Constable such a curious and intriguing figure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"Fed Raises Interest Rates on Dubious Grounds; How to Fight Inflation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/opinion/l-fed-raises-interest-rates-on-dubious-grounds-how-to-fight-inflation-927872.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   After five interest rate increases this year, the Fed has done it again.

Oh, yes, the vast scale model looks remarkably like a city: five boroughs worth of miniature buildings, streets, parks and bridges. But don't be fooled.

You will survey the city through the eyes of the man who transformed it.   Then, moments after stepping inside that legendarily imperial dome, you may begin to discern an urban vision of your own. Memories, hopes, triumphs, disappointments: these are among the landmarks on the private map that begins to take shape as you look around the Panorama. The places you've lived, or wanted to. The good or bad times you had there.

Moreover, Council concerns over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's October proposal that much of the cutting be imposed on social services are justified. But the Council's authority to vote its own plan is ambiguous. Both sides should want the courts to clear up the ambiguity, though it would be risky and costly to delay cuts while courts ruminate.   This confrontation is over political muscle, not fiscal details. The revised City Charter gave the Council substantially more power than before. Up to this point, the Council has not exploited that power aggressively. Now its Democratic majority is embarrassed by its failure to press for more changes in the new Republican Mayor's original budget when it could have done so last June. Members are also angry that he now proposes to cancel some of the few changes they made. June was the time to fight.

The first half of the concert was given over to Tchaikovsky's blustery Piano Concerto No. 1, for which Elisabeth Leonskaja was the soloist. It was a puzzling reading. At times, textures in the solo line were fuzzy and indistinct, as if Miss Leonskaja were wearing mittens. Elsewhere she summoned considerable clarity and force, and even a touch of impetuousness that enlivened parts of the outer movements. Yet on the whole there was little in this gray reading to capture the imagination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941126","headline":"Use of Army to Fight Crime in Rio Makes Many Feel Safer in Streets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/26/world/use-of-army-to-fight-crime-in-rio-makes-many-feel-safer-in-streets.html","abstract":"  Two olive green Panther helicopters droned in wide circles over the vast, human amphitheater of the Nova Brasilia shantytown.

What she offers is a sweet, beautifully manipulated and, in her best moments, seductively sensual sound. But much of the time, this sheer vocal beauty comes at a cost in depth. How serious a problem that is depends on what a listener looks for in a recital. There are times, after all, when one is grateful for ravishing vocalism and willing to overlook everything else.    Perhaps the best example of this transaction at work on Tuesday was Haydn's \"Grande Scena di Berenice,\" a showpiece that draws both its form and its energy from touching on emotional extremes, and which demands considerable vocal flexibility. Flexibility was no problem for Miss Caballe. She moved easily between the scene's recitative and aria sections, regulating color and dynamics in much the same way a master instrumentalist might. It was consistently elegant singing. Yet the work's drama and emotionalism seemed locked behind a patrician veneer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941126","headline":"Warsaw Bourse Weathering Plunge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/26/your-money/IHT-warsaw-bourse-weathering-plunge.html","abstract":"INVESTORS who entered the Polish equity market at the beginning of 1993 probably wished that capitalism had arrived in the Baltics sooner.

Next month two of the properties are scheduled to officially open, following extensive refurbishments.    The former Paradise Island Resort and Casino, renamed Atlantis, Paradise Island, is scheduled to open fully on Dec. 22. The resort has been partly closed since last May when its $125 million refurbishment began.  The property will include a 14-acre water park with a 3-million-gallon saltwater outdoor aquarium stocked with 100 species of fish, including sharks, rays and barracuda.  There will also be fivepools, waterfalls, water slides and a quarter-mile-long \"river ride.\" The hotel's 1,150 rooms and casino have been redone, and two new restaurants have been built, for a total of 12; one of the restaurants will be entered via a 100-foot-long clear tunnel through the aquarium.  Double rooms will be $130 to $325 a night, depending on date and location. The Ocean Club, a 71-room resort that once belonged to Huntington Hartford, is being restored at a cost of $7.5 million and is scheduled to reopen Dec. 20. It has been closed since October.

Trithemius's optimism for manuscript production and pessimism for typography were both exaggerations, and many views on the computer revolution evoke this same ambivalence.    Traditional books will always be printed, and in good quantities, for the simple reason that when it comes to actual reading, they are vatly easier to use than a computer and monitor. It is inconceivable that anyone would want to try to read \"The Great Gatsby\" (much less \"Ulysses\" or \"Moby-Dick\") in any form but a printed one. On the other hand, as the essay points out so well, computer technology has already radically transformed the character of research, information management and publication.    When it comes to technological innovation, intellectual evaluation often yields to emotional anxiety. Trithemius was wrong: by itself, print destroyed neither book production nor morality. It did not even eliminate writing by hand. If computerphobes take heart in this, computerphiles might take caution from the fact that the technology they seek to replace was itself once trumpeted as the ultimate solution to problems cognitive, pedagogic and economic.

Automobile horn blowing seems unnecessary in a city. I believe it is prohibited in Paris, for example. Is it against the law here?  A. Now, don't panic. But right now, all over the city, thousands of New York City residents are flouting the authority of Section 24-221a of the city's Noise Control Code: \"No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated any claxon installed on a motor a vehicle except as a sound signal of imminent danger.\"   While losing your job for being late or suffering a nervous breakdown in midday traffic may fit many people's idea of \"imminent danger,\" technically it still doesn't justify using your car horn.   But, luckily for cacophonous car owners, the city does not pursue offenders rigorously; generally, the Environmental Control Board levies fewer than 10 fines a year for car horn violations.   To register complaints about noise pollution, call the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's 24-hour complaint line, (718) DEP-HELP. Sheriff Fetches Fines Q. I saw a white car marked Sheriff holding up traffic in Central Park. Who is the New York City Sheriff, and what does he do?  A. Despite its folksy moniker and long history, the New York City Sheriff has more to do with tow trucks than with gunfights. Established in 1626, the Sheriff's office in Manhattan and its equivalents in the other boroughs served as a major part of the patchwork of law-enforcement agencies that existed before the city's consolidation in 1898.   After that, the new New York City Police Department took over the responsibility for criminal investigations and arrests. As recently as 1942, the Sheriff was also responsible for manning and administering the city's jails, a duty now carried by the Department of Correction.   Today, the sheriff's primary duties are enforcing court-ordered judgments and fines, including unpaid parking tickets and littering fines, and collecting judgments from reluctant losers in private lawsuits, said John George, the Sheriff's executive assistant.   Sheriff's deputies, outfitted in dark blue uniforms and state-trooper style Stetsons, carry guns and can make arrests if they see a crime in action.   In recent years, the Sheriff's office, though small in comparison to the City Police Department, has been no stranger to attention. The previous Sheriff, Philip A. Crimaldi, found himself in hot water with the City Council and city marshals (who also collect fees for the city) for his tough tactics with parking-ticket scofflaws, which included seizing their cars.   Some residents also accused Mr. Crimaldi's deputies of using tactics reminiscent of the Old West, including brandishing weapons to collect unpaid fines. Mr. Crimaldi denied his deputies acted improperly.   But now there's a new Sheriff in town. Kerry John Katsorhis, a Queens lawyer, was appointed on June 2 by Mayor Giuliani as the 108th Sheriff of New York City.   And as for weapons, Mr. Katsorhis said shortly after his appointment that, frankly, he doesn't like guns. But does he wear a star? More Lawyers, by Far Q. My friend and I (he a litigious drone, I an artist) got into an argument that you might be able to settle. Are there more lawyers or more actors in New York City?  A. The drones have it. As of Sept. 1, the State Office of Court Adminstration shows 63,823 registered lawyers doing business in New York City. By comparison, actors seem practically scarce.   According to Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors Equity, the professional actors and stage managers union, there are about 16,000 professional actors registered with Equity in the New York City area. This figure does not, however, include legions of nonunion actors or actors working only in film or television.   Though more lawyers means more competition, they can take solace in the fact that they're at least registered as \"doing business\"; the average weekly unemployment rate for Equity actors runs at about 83 percent.

Sullivan, a former reporter for The San Diego Tribune and The San Diego Union-Tribune, has written an extremely deft first novel, THE FALL LINE (Kensington Books, 850 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022; $20). Not many investigative journalists have the sensitivity and poetry that are exhibited in this book.   The central character is Jack Farrell, a successful investment banker in California who represents a powerful Central American businessman. Farrell finds himself a hunted criminal because of what his job is really all about: laundering money for a drug cartel.   Mr. Sullivan effectively interweaves flashbacks, stream of consciousness and, above all, exciting action. Farrell is a daredevil skier, and heads to the mountains of Utah when he goes on the lam. He accepts a job offer from a mysterious Frenchwoman who is making a documentary film about skiing. Meanwhile, Government agents and drug lords are after him.   All of the characters in \"The Fall Line\" are believable. The reader identifies with the flawed hero, with his wife, even with the smart, civilized drug kingpin who sets Jack Farrell on the wrong course.     The title of Ross Thomas's latest thriller, AH, TREACHERY! (Mysterious Press/Warner, $21.95), is adapted from Plutarch's characterization of Romulus: \"He loved treachery but hated a traitor.\" And treachery is what this novel is all about. Mr. Thomas, a very skillful writer, lets us dangle for a while -- who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? -- as he unfolds his story in natural, free-flowing language laced with humor and sophisticated dialogue.   His protagonist is Edd Partain, a Vietnam War hero who is now a clerk in a Wyoming gun shop. Partain is sitting on a secret that is political dynamite. A figure from his past turns up and puts some pressure on him. Suddenly Partain finds himself working for Millicent Altford, a smart woman who raises money for politicians. A lot of money has been stolen from her, and she wants Partain to help her get it back.   Things get confusing. Something very big is going on. Powerful people want Partain out of the way. The C.I.A.'s dirty-tricks division shows up. Two generals try to outwit each other. Unsavory politics and politicians are laid bare.   Mr. Thomas makes some pertinent observations. He is concerned about the ethics problem that has so many American voters convinced that their elected representatives are puppets on the payroll of lobbyists or the special-interest conglomerates. Millicent Altford knows what to do. This is her response to a Congressman who has asked for advice on how to reform campaign financing:   \"Simple. . . . Do away with soft money. Provide Federal financing. Establish campaign spending limits -- proportional ones, of course -- so somebody running for the Senate in New York can spend more than somebody running for it in South Dakota. You know all the cures. It's just that most of you guys don't want to take them.\"     We have all read a great deal about the Mafia. Now here's another crime family, this one from East India. In Mitchell Smith's novel KARMA (Dutton, $22.95), we are introduced to some especially nasty types.   Evan Scott, an architect in New York, is examining the skeleton of a New York skyscraper his firm is constructing when a woman falls to her death from the building. An accident? Murder? The police actually suspect the architect. When he and his family find themselves in danger, he assumes the initiative. The hunted becomes the hunter, and Scott, aided by a sweet, dignified, elderly Indian, uses the skills he acquired as an officer in the Vietnam War.   Mr. Smith, the author of the thrillers \"Daydreams\" and \"Stone City,\" is good at depicting mounting terror. He has created a monster of a killer, an Indian giant working for the crime family. Toward the end there is a chilling duel on the beams of the skyscraper, and there is a final shoot-out that pushes belief a bit too far. But no matter. \"Karma\" will keep you engrossed.     In IXTAPA (Donald I. Fine, $19.95), E. Howard Hunt brings back Jack Novak, now on special assignment for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Mexico. Novak's objective is to penetrate a drug cartel, which he does in no-words-wasted pulp prose. Everything is predictable, but it's fun in a junky, innocent way. In STONE DANCER (Pocket, $22), the British writer Murray Smith concocts a computer scam that could involve the ruin of the American dollar. The Israeli Mossad, the Sicilian Mafia and the United States Secret Service all make appearances. The novel is unbelievable and cliche-ridden, but it's also lively and action-packed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Grand Dame of the G.O.P.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/nyregion/making-it-work-grand-dame-of-the-gop.html","abstract":"  NEVER mind that it was late November and that Election Day had come and gone and that a victory had been won.

Many deeply religious Americans, Catholics included, are greatly disturbed by the push to obtain public tax funds for New Jersey parochial schools. It is wrong to demand tax financing for parochial schools when there is now tax exemption for the same schools.   Involuntary tax financing for parochial schools that are contrary to the religion of millions of other Americans will polarize the community along religious lines. It will endanger the tolerance and religious peace we have enjoyed in America for over 200 years. Religion is taught in the churches and Sunday schools, in absolute freedom. That is what they are for.   The public school system, which has helped make America the greatest nation on earth, bar none, will be destroyed in time. The public simply cannot support multiple high-quality school systems. The average citizen just can't pay his regular taxes and support his church and support someone else's church, against his will. Let's be very clear and honest about it: this radical plan means stupendous new taxes.    If the idea is such a panacea, and people are so supposedly for it, put it on a statewide ballot. If the people vote \"yes,\" fine. If they vote \"no,\" forget it.   And this is a lay, nonteacher citizen talking.

Ms. Karbo, true to this introduction, describes the novel as \"vintage Robbins, a recommendation for those of you who can stand it.\"    Ms. Karbo has an obvious intolerance for the elements of comic fantasy in Mr. Robbins's works, and she is not averse to using bias and exaggeration to sway her readers to her point of view.

Kennedy, and almost without realizing it found himself a member of a campaign in those early days when few people bothered to turn out for Kennedy appearances. Only slowly, he recalls, did he come to realize that \"we\" were running for President. The 1960 election won, J.F.K. asked Lowe to stick around and record his Administration. Given carte blanche to roam the White House, Mr. Lowe amassed, in the end, some 40,000 negatives of the Camelot years, what he calls \"the most complete photographic record of any Administration in American history\" in his selection of these shots, JFK REMEMBERED (Random House, $37.50). His commentary, witty and just a bit offbeat, accompanies stunning photographs, some familiar, some never before published. Mr. Lowe lends a new dimension to some of the era's most historic moments: the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Bay of Pigs discussions, the Paris meeting with Charles de Gaulle when the French leader used every ruse to keep the photographer away, the Khrushchev summit in Vienna with the Russian leader totally charmed by Mrs. Kennedy while the President looked miserable with Mrs. Khrushchev. Always at Kennedy's heels, the photographer was inevitably drawn into the private moments; the President insisted that Mr. Lowe take pictures of his daughter, Caroline, knowing that her mother did not want the children photographed. We have finally a personal retrospective on Kennedy history, private and public. In his foreword, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. writes that he recognized in Lowe a fellow historian \"with a passion to record actualities -- not to reconstruct for the sake of a prettier photograph.\" LYNN KARPEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Journal; The Victory Rush","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/opinion/journal-the-victory-rush.html","abstract":"  Of all those saying \"I told you so\" to the Democrats this month, no one is louder than Rush Limbaugh, whose latest best seller is conveniently titled \"See, I Told You So\" and whose voice reaches some 20 million Americans each week.

The concert, which is meant to give an overview of women's contribution to jazz, will feature the music of historical figures like Mary Lou Williams along with the music of and performances by Melba Liston, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Carla Bley and Maria Schneider. It will allow some of the better female arrangers and improvisers working in jazz to display their wares before a large audience. Taken as a group, they yet again make the case that women can and do play the music well.   Two things are disturbing about the concert. In its packaging, the concert implies that women need special ways of being marketed, a kind of Women's Night, suggesting that musicians, promoters and audiences haven't supported women enough. More insidious is the lingering perception of women as anomalies in jazz. The Carnegie Hall program is nothing less than the continued, systematic ghettoization of female performers and begs the most obvious question of all. If these women are good enough to be featured on stage together and audiences are charged up to $55 to hear them, why aren't they good enough to appear regularly in the presence of their male peers with no reference made to their sex?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Expand NATO -- And Split Europe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/opinion/expand-nato-and-split-europe.html","abstract":"  At this week's meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, the Clinton Administration is planning to push the alliance to begin the process of extending security guarantees to the new democracies of Central Europe.

The Saturday matinee will be followed by a discussion among dancers, choreographers and the audience.   The event is called \"A New Generation of Dance in Westchester,\" and the featured dancer-choreographer is Wally Cardona, soloist with the Ralph Lemon Dance Company. Mr. Cardona will appear in the American premiere of a work he created on commission by Danscentrum in Stockholm.   All the remaining works, created and performed by emerging choreographers and dancers from Westchester and Rockland Counties, were selected by auditions on Oct. 30, or commissions awarded during the year by the Dance in Education Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in White Plains.   Judges at the auditions were Bessie Schoenberg, dance educator; Carol Walker, dean of Purchase College's dance department, and Kevin Ward, choreographer and teacher.   Dawn Watson's \"Solas na Gealaigh,\" drawn from traditional Irish music and dance themes, will be presented along with Karen Schatten's \"Haircut,\" Tim Martin's \"Small Feats,\" Caroline Oxenham's \"Driftwood\" and Carl Flink's \"Doodle for Bunny Boy,\" a segment of his \"Field Songs\" scheduled in its entirety at the 92d Street Y in Manhattan next month.

ALL ABOUT STAMPS   Michael Endres, owner of the Coin and Stamp Exchange in White Plains, will speak Thursday about stamps, the world's No. 1 hobby and the preferred investment for many collectors. The lecture is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. in the Greenburgh Public Library, 300 Tarrytown Road, Elmsford, and admission is free.   Mr. Endres is a certified philatelic appraiser and a member of the American Philatelic Society. He has been a dealer in White Plains for two decades and a stamp collector for 29 years.   \"It's not a short-term investment,\" Mr. Endres said, \"and to have a good long-term investment you should collect classical material in very good condition, not large quantities of modern issues.\"   He observed that good buying conditions have existed since 1988 when people started selling their holdings at discount prices during the recession. \"Now we are seeing an increase in price and a shortage of supply,\" Mr. Endres said, because what was purchased in the recession \"is being held by the buyers for future appreciation.\"   The Pacific Rim countries, especially China, are the hot spots for stamp collectors today, Mr. Endres said. \"Some 1970's Chinese issues are extremely desirable,\" he said. \"They were illegal to own or to use as postage in China because they contained inflammatory political slogans. The Government issued other stamps at the time with which to mail letters.\" A MUSICAL UPDATE   Victor Herbert's \"Babes in Toyland,\" produced as a touring holiday show by Troupe America under the direction of Curt Wollan, will be presented at Lehman College in the Bronx next Saturday at 2 and 7 P.M.   Decked out in new sets and costumes and accompanied by an ensemble, this version was written by William Mount-Burke and Alice Hammerstein Nathias. Performances will take place at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, at 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West. Tickets are $20, $22.50 and $25; children will be admitted for half price at the 7 P.M. performance, and discounts for the elderly are available. Call (718) 960-8833 for reservations or more information. HOLIDAY BAZAAR   The Christmas ornaments that will be for sale next Saturday at the St. John's Episcopal Church Holiday Bazaar in Larchmont can be embellished by Grace Coughlin, a calligrapher who will inscribe them with names or messages.   From 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. the church's Parish Hall on Fountain Square will be filled with gift items handcrafted by parishioners, including knitwear, jewelry, stenciled place settings and topiary. In addition, there will be books, toys, antiques, textiles, electronic and sports equipment, a white elephant table and home-baked apple and pecan pies. Children will be kept occupied from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. in a special corner with arts and crafts, games and a confidential chat with Santa, and lunch will be served from noon to 2 P.M. For more information, call 834-2981. JOHN JAY CHRISTMAS   The re-creation of Christmases past at historic sites provides a major source of entertainment, and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah, a New York State Historic Site, always puts on a first-rate show.   It will begin next Saturday with tours of the Federal-style mansion from noon to 5 P.M., continuing Sunday and the weekend of Dec. 10 and 11 at the same hours. The house will be decorated from top to bottom, and a full complement of antique crystal, china, silver and replicated 19th-century foods will be set up in the dining room. The parlor, where it was customary to adjourn for the last course of the Christmas dinner, will display desserts, and in the study, a punch bowl filled with citrus juices and Madeira will stand at the ready.   The decorations and foods have been carefully researched from notes left by the Jay family, and visitors who do not wish to be part of a tour may stroll through the house at will, guided by a descriptive brochure.   Special programs include Paul Peabody and his puppets on Dec. 10 at 1 and 3:30 P.M. Children may sit on the floor at the foot of the stage, but chairs will be available for parents. After each show, cookies and apple cider will be served.   On Dec. 11 the Bedford Bell Ringers will perform at 1 and 3:30 P.M. in the ballroom, and downstairs in the kitchen a costumed cook will talk about preparing Christmas feasts on an open hearth. Visitors will be offered samples from 19th-century recipes.   More than 5,000 come to the homestead holiday celebrations, and it is wise to arrive for the puppet and bell-ringer performances at least an hour early.   Daily admission is $6, $5 for children and people 65 and older. Proceeds help maintain the historic site on Route 22 off Exit 6 of I-684. Call 232-5651 for more information.

Why isn't it obvious that this writer writes the equivalent of cotton candy? Bite, swallow and there's nothing there.    Having read Mr. Ashbery and having come to the aforementioned candy conclusion, I thought that listening to him read his own work would show me what I was missing, and as director of the International Poetry Forum I invited him to Pittsburgh some years ago. Mr. Ashbery in person gave me the same impression as he did on the page. Here was seemingly sophisticated dullness raised to new heights. Why then this cavalcade of praise for such an opaque writer when there are poets like Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Mona Van Duyn, Linda Pastan, Hayden Carruth, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Barton Sutter, Brendan Galvin, Peter Makuck, Philip Levine, Charles Causely, Philip Booth, Miller Williams and Naomi Shihav Nye -- writers of genuine talent and vision with something to say -- unignorably among us?    I have heard Mr. Ashbery's prominence attributed to everything from another example of the tale of the emperor's new clothes to the influence of a friendly cabal on the East Coast.

If the sentimental old dears were to come back in an all-star revival today the intelligent modern theatergoing audience would walk out on them.\"   Well, as anyone can see by attending the latest revival of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's 67-year-old musical based on the novel, strong men are indeed weeping as in Magnolia's day, and at least at the performance I attended, nobody showed any inclination to walk out on any sentimental old dears. In fact, audiences at the Gershwin Theater are cheering, and even sober-minded critics more used to unamplified voices in grander-styled music dramas have been swept away in the musical currents. What a difference from Leonard Bernstein's \"Wonderful Town,\" which just finished its run at the New York City Opera; that musical may be three decades younger than \"Show Boat,\" but it seems as creaky as a dilapidated steamship.

Trithemius's optimism for manuscript production and pessimism for typography were both exaggerations, and many views on the computer revolution evoke this same ambivalence.    Traditional books will always be printed, and in good quantities, for the simple reason that when it comes to actual reading, they are vatly easier to use than a computer and monitor. It is inconceivable that anyone would want to try to read \"The Great Gatsby\" (much less \"Ulysses\" or \"Moby-Dick\") in any form but a printed one. On the other hand, as the essay points out so well, computer technology has already radically transformed the character of research, information management and publication.    When it comes to technological innovation, intellectual evaluation often yields to emotional anxiety. Trithemius was wrong: by itself, print destroyed neither book production nor morality. It did not even eliminate writing by hand. If computerphobes take heart in this, computerphiles might take caution from the fact that the technology they seek to replace was itself once trumpeted as the ultimate solution to problems cognitive, pedagogic and economic.

By the end of the day there would be snow showers, but the snow hadn't started yet. The sun was still shining on a cold autumn morning that felt like winter. The woman had a long brown scarf draped over her head like a hood. Her steps were painfully slow. She was heading north on Lexington, in search of a meal.    An old man had directed the woman toward Emmaus House, at Lexington and 124th Street, which provides a bit of food for the destitute and the working poor in a setting reminiscent of the Great Depression.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"A Truly Swinging Version","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/arts/l-in-the-pines-a-truly-swinging-version-928151.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Here in outstate New York, Ken Van Etten, the mainstay of the Corning Grassworks, a local bluegrass band, has been wowing audiences for years with a unique rendition of \"In the Pines.\" His version features a solo on the \"sewer pipe\" (a crinkled, blue plastic tube about five feet long and three inches in diameter), which, when swung furiously in circles around his head, enables Mr. Van Etten to produce an eerie wail of varying pitch.

But the good news from the tangled back lot of this little 1920 apartment complex is that it is being reclaimed, inch by inch, by Joy Duchon, who makes a two-and-a-half-hour commute from Connecticut to fix up a part of New York that New Yorkers can't even take care of themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19941127","headline":"Irish Parties Seem to Be Making Progress Toward New Coalition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/world/irish-parties-seem-to-be-making-progress-toward-new-coalition.html","abstract":"  Nine days after the collapse of Ireland's Government, party leaders seemed today to be making progress toward forming a new coalition, which would avoid the necessity of calling a general election to end the political confusion.

The Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, had failed to extradite a Roman Catholic priest to Northern Ireland to face charges of child molestation.
