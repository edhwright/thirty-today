The work's finale is a tribute to P. D. Q.'s purported father, Johann Sebastian Bach, and therefore used the dark, chromatic four-note motif that J. S. used as a musical signature. Who else but P. D. Q. Bach would introduce a rambunctious version of \"He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" as a counter theme?   Mr. Schickele probably would, but until musicologists prove otherwise, listeners must accept his claim to be merely the discoverer of this and other P. D. Q. Bach works, not its author. Musicologists will most likely steer clear of Mr. Schickele, though. For the last 29 years he has been sending them up royally in his annual seminars on P. D. Q.
