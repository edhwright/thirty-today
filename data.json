Like many forgetful natives and startled visitors, he discovered the fearfulness California can display -- a combination of the sublime and the apocalyptic sufficient to sharpen anyone's sense of an ending.\n\nAnything sublime is terrifying, and anyone who lives in California must sometimes suspect a connection beyond the obvious between the sublimity of the landscape and the terrible events, natural disasters and human calamities it so often witnesses.\n\nCzeslaw Milosz, the Nobel Prizewinner in literature, questioned in a 1980 essay whether anybody belongs in California. Its spirit of place seems intolerant of mere mankind, he said.\n\nThe sense of an ending that broods over the land, especially in Southern California, has preoccupied our best California writers, from Mark Twain to Joan Didion, not to mention opinionated tourists like Henry James and Umberto Eco. But is this eerie sensation a property of the land, some combination of freakish weather and violent, moody geology that communicates itself? Or is it society, equally freakish, projecting itself onto the landscape? Southern California, after all, is a vast polyglot city-state dependent for its water, power and labor on a vast and far-reaching infra structural web whose fragility is devastatingly apparent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"STATE OF THE UNION: The Republicans; In G.O.P.

There is even subversive social comment in the uneasily casual relationship between the Count and his retainers. Add to that some top-drawer Mozart, with hardly a wasted gesture in either the vocal or the orchestral writing, and you have a work that should be a high point of the opera season.   Those considerable joys are tempered at the Metropolitan Opera, where Figaro and his friends enact their drama in the resolutely ugly sets that Jean-Pierre Ponnelle designed in 1985. When the production returned to the house on Monday evening, an interestingly balanced cast and astute conducting by Julius Rudel afforded ample musical pleasures. But it was difficult to avoid either the distractions of the production or, on a cheerier note, the thought that each season carries its crumbling pillars and archways, its unrealistically placed portals and its drab costumes closer to the trash heap.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/nyregion/metro-digest-984540.html","abstract":"  RENO TO PURSUE CROWN HTS.

It goes without saying that stage pieces like \"Mahagonny\" and \"The Threepenny Opera\" made Weill famous in a way that his earlier pursuit of the classical European tradition never would have.   The Quartet smoothly masters old ideas: stretched tonality, imitations of previous forms, studious use of imitative counterpoint and even some impudent use of different meters and speeds playing against one another.  But imbedded in these textures is the signature that was to be read more clearly in just a few years. Popular dance rhythms and balladlike melodies are among them. Listen carefully and you will also hear Weill's celebration of the march, used here with characteristic bitterness and humor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"A Culture of Clique : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/opinion/IHT-a-culture-of-clique-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"A Destructive Culture of Critique\" (Opinion, Jan. 18) by Deborah Tannen and \"Shouting at One Another in Lieu of Useful Debate\" (Opinion, Jan. 20) by William Pfaff:.Has the press really gotten nastier over the past few yea","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"The Biggest Dragon : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/opinion/IHT-the-biggest-dragon-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Don't Trust the Reports of Superheated Growth\" (Opinion, Jan. 19) by Christopher Lingle and Kurt Wickman:.The authors, senior fellows in European affairs at Singapore University, question the accuracy of World Bank estimates of Chi","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/us/inside-984370.html","abstract":"  A Growing Power in Russia   Prime Minister Viktor S.

Now, with the Los Angeles Music Center Opera production of \"El Gato Montes\" (\"The Wild Cat\"), which opened here last week, our complacent neglect of the Spanish opera may be in for a revision, too. This zarzuela, written in 1916 by Manuel Penella and, the Los Angeles company says, never before sung in this country in its original language, is dramatic, vigorous and lyrically inventive.   The work has been championed by Placido Domingo, who has been singing in these performances and is artistic consultant to the Los Angeles Opera. The production, which is imported from the Teatro Lirico Nacional la Zarzuela in Madrid, is also part of a conscious effort to attract Hispanic audiences to the opera house. A.T.& T. has given a three-year, $100,000 grant for this purpose, used to support this and future productions. There is even an organization, \"Hispanics for L.A.

Yeltsin's condemnation of the handling of the Kronstadt revolt is the one you never address. Why did the Russian President choose the eve of the Parliament's opening to drag out and dust off 70-year-old slanders and attacks against the Bolshevik Government led by Lenin and Trotsky?   No doubt it's because Mr. Yeltsin feels the threat of growing resistance to privatization and his plans to place Russia's natural resources at the service of Western capitalism. Antiprivatization forces in combination got a significantly higher percentage of votes in the Dec. 12 elections than Mr. Yelstin's fast-track capitalism. His greatest fear must be that the will of the Russian people will congeal behind forces for a democratized, genuinely socialist course and sweep both him and the ultraright Vladimir V.

The new work was commissioned by Betty Freeman for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Yo-Yo Ma (who was the soloist in its first performance with the orchestra, conducted by David Zinman); it is partly a response to the deaths of the composers Andrzej Panufnik and Stephen Albert as well as Schuman, and quotes from them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"Guns Gaining on Cars as a Leading U.S. Killer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/us/guns-gaining-on-cars-as-a-leading-us-killer.html","abstract":"  If current trends continue, gunshot wounds will take more lives nationwide than automobile accidents by 2003 -- a point already reached in the District of Columbia and six states, including New York, according to a report released today by the Department of Health and Human Services.   \"It is appalling that in the world's strongest and wealthiest country, death by firearms is increasing at the alarming rate these studies find,\" Health Secretary Donna E.

Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 11. The film, in Vietnamese with English subtitles, opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema, Broadway at 63d Street.   \"The Scent of Green Papaya\" is Tran Anh Hung's tranquilly beautiful film about a lost Vietnam, a peaceful, orderly place not yet touched by wartime. The film begins in Saigon in 1951, in a household safely insulated from the first rumblings of trouble. The family in question has more personal problems, since these people are still mourning the death of a young daughter several years earlier, and since the husband (Tran Ngoc Trung) has a history of disappearing for long periods with his family's money. The wife (Truong Thi Loc) endures these desertions with the stoicism the film generally ascribes to Vietnamese women.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"Bills Move To Right On Passing Strategy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/sports/super-bowl-xxviii-bills-move-to-right-on-passing-strategy.html","abstract":"  There was a time two years ago that the Buffalo Bills, operating from their no-huddle offense, would aggressively attack teams with their passing game, stretching the field and hitting big plays. It was nothing for quarterback Jim Kelly to send receivers James Lofton and Don Beebe streaking down the field on deep post routes, and run Andre Reed across the middle, leaving opposing defenses in a quandary.   But in the last two years the Bills passing game has changed. Lofton is gone. Beebe is the lone speedster now, but not much of a threat without Lofton.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"Reviews/ Film; About Prostitutes Plying The Manhattan Streets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/movies/reviews-film-about-prostitutes-plying-the-manhattan-streets.html","abstract":"  The line between reality and make-believe is painfully apparent in Amos Kollek's pseudo-documentary film, \"Bad Girls.\" In the movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, Mr. Kollek portrays a middle-aged writer named Jack who is researching a book about the lives of prostitutes in mid-Manhattan.   Jack sets up shop in a seedy hotel near Times Square and goes about interviewing his subjects. Approximately half the women in the film are actresses playing streetwalkers whose reminiscences Mr. Kollek captured on tape but who could not appear in the movie. The rest are actual prostitutes who tell their stories directly to the camera.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"A Festival of Chamber Music From Mexico","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/arts/a-festival-of-chamber-music-from-mexico.html","abstract":"  \"South America as a whole does not exist,\" Aaron Copland declared after his 1941 tour of nine Latin American countries. \"It is a collection of separate countries, each with different traditions. . . .
