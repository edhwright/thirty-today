Recent advances in cellular biology suggest that wounds caused by accidents or resulting from surgery might be made to heal without a trace.   For years scientists have puzzled over the remarkable ability of a fetus that has had surgery in the womb to emerge at birth scar-free. In humans, this occurs if the surgery is performed in the first five months after conception. After that time, scarring occurs as it would after birth, leaving what may turn out to be lifelong reminders of assaults on the body's soft armor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Health"},{"date":"19930928","headline":"Dinkins and the Race Issue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/nyregion/dinkins-and-the-race-issue.html","abstract":"  By musing aloud on whether too many New Yorkers were reluctant to support Mayor Dinkins's re-election in part because he is black, President Clinton voiced a sentiment that many of the Mayor's supporters have tried to raise for years.

But the most peculiar change would have come after the second intermission, when the tenor, transformed into the supposed son of a gypsy, actually split in half and fought a mock duel with himself.   Such are the vagaries of opening-night galas. This one consisted of three separate acts, from three separate operas, united by one theme: the power of the two tenors playing the three roles, who happen to be among the most renowned voices of their generation. The two tenors, in case anybody has missed the best-selling recordings and videos and a generation of hype and well-deserved praise, were Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti (in alphabetical order, to avoid any possible ruffled feathers in their long-term rivalry). Mr. Domingo has the leaner, more pointed voice, able to take on more robust roles in the dramatic category with intelligence and skill; Mr. Pavarotti has had the fleshier, more extroverted (and possibly more popular) instrument, preferring a narrower repertory focused largely on the lyric roles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930928","headline":"There Are Better Ways to Pursue Peace Than Mere Deterrence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/opinion/IHT-there-are-better-ways-to-pursue-peace-than-mere-deterrence.html","abstract":"Nation-states spend too much on the military instruments of security and not nearly enough on prevention, resolution and management of disputes.

Discovery of the wall, which they thought they had detected the previous summer, would for the first time define the full size of the city, well beyond the inner citadel excavated in the 1870's.   Unless their geomagnetic survey was mistaken, archeologists thought buried remnants of the wall would be found about 1,300 feet outside the central fortress and its palaces, where the wall presumably encompassed the much larger settlement of craftsmen, merchants and soldiers and sailors. The archeologists dug and dug in the area where the survey had indicated the presence of a thick clay wall, but could find no sign of it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930928","headline":"Campaigning in Clinton's Wake","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/nyregion/campaigning-in-clinton-s-wake.html","abstract":"  By musing aloud Sunday on whether too many New Yorkers were reluctant to support Mayor David N.

Last year, nearly 6,700 volunteers provided more than 590,000 hours of instruction to more than 83,000 students. By 1995 the program hopes to enlist 7,500 tutors to serve up to 100,000 students annually.

advanced to the second round of the European Champions Cup last night in less-than-impressive form. A crowd of 40,000 whistled at San Siro Stadium in Italy as Milan played a scoreless tie against the Swiss champion, FC Aarau, and advanced, 1-0, on aggregate in the home-and-home series. United, in its first home game in the Champions Cup at Old Trafford in 24 years, beat Honved Kispest of Hungary, 2-1, on a pair of goals by Steve Bruce and advanced, 5-3, on aggregate. On a night when 43 European games were played, all five Italian teams advanced. Joining AC Milan were Torino in the Cup Winners Cup and Cagliari, Inter Milan and Lazio in the U.E.F.A. Cup. Scottish champion Glasgow Rangers, which won the first leg at home, 3-2, allowed Nikolai Todarov to score in the final minute, giving Levski Sofia a 2-1 victory and sending the Bulgarians into the next round on away goals. The Spanish champion, Barcelona, led by a pair of goals from Jose Maria Bakero, beat Dinamo Kiev of Ukraine, 4-1, and advanced, 5-4, on aggregate. (AP) TENNIS No. 1 Edberg Still Feels at Home in Basel Stefan Edberg, who is bidding to win this tournament a fourth time, defeated Christian Bergstroem, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), yesterday to advance to the second round of the $800,000 Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel, Switzerland.

In Constant Motion    From his call for regional efforts to end the de facto segregation of Connecticut public education, to his end run around Las Vegas casino developers who retreated in failure after spending millions to push for casinos in Bridgeport and Hartford, to his sudden and single-minded push to get a pro football franchise for Connecticut, Mr. Weicker has been a player in constant motion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930930","headline":"What They're Reading","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/30/opinion/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Kurt Kasch, member of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank in Berlin, is currently reading \"Goodbye, Germany,\" a book in German by British correspondent Jonathan Carr. .\"I am enjoying this book, because it recounts the author's lon","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930930","headline":"Coleman Won't Listen Later, So Talk Now","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/30/sports/sports-people-basketball-coleman-won-t-listen-later-so-talk-now.html","abstract":"  Talks between the Nets and the agent for DERRICK COLEMAN are not exactly deadlocked, but they are definitely on the hold button.

In her performance at Alice Tully Hall on Tuesday evening, Sept. 21, Miss Kaas seemed to emulate the career path that has given the German pop diva Ute Lemper a foothold in the American market. It is not the way to go.   Aside from nationality, the basic difference between Miss Lemper and Miss Kaas is that the former is an art singer who works mostly within the upper reaches of European music-hall tradition. Miss Kaas, by contrast, is a pop singer who only occasionally ventures into that territory to show that she has class to match her pop savvy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930930","headline":"Sports of The Times; The Merry-Go-Round Stops Here","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/30/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-merry-go-round-stops-here.html","abstract":"  TWO years ago this weekend, Dusty Baker, then a Giants' coach, stared at the Dodgers standing around the batting cage at Candlestick Park.   \"You could see it in their eyes, in the way their shoulders slumped,\" Baker would say later. \"They knew they weren't going to win.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930930","headline":"Defendant in Youth's Strangling May Testify","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/30/nyregion/defendant-in-youth-s-strangling-may-testify.html","abstract":"  Where was James P.

Fernandez will go through his routine at Shea mildly fatalistic about his chances of signing a contract extension, nostalgic for the highlights of a decade in Queens and determined not to be shortchanged in the marketplace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930930","headline":"Giants Falter Against Rockies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/30/sports/baseball-giants-falter-against-rockies.html","abstract":"  With a touch of confidence, the San Francisco Giants were told today to pack for a nine-day road trip, which would optimistically include a pit-stop next week in Philadelphia for the opening of the National League Championship Series.

It measures the effects of an earthquake at a given location, distinguished from the earthquake's inherent force or strength as measured by seismic magnitude scales. While shaking is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. Deeper earthquakes also have less interaction with the surface, and their energy is spread out across a larger volume. Shaking intensity is localized, generally diminishing with distance from the earthquake's epicenter, but can be amplified in sedimentary basins and certain kinds of unconsolidated soils."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930930","time":"1993-09-30
