The Giants need a victory over Dallas Saturday, plus help from Tampa Bay in its game against Green Bay, to qualify for a National Football League wild-card playoff spot. And there may be no one on the Giants who would like to beat Dallas in the Giants' final regular-season game than Brown himself.

Critics of Nafta, the free-trade accord between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, chimed in with the proposition that the peso's fall would turn bilateral trade against the U.S., thereby vindicating their opposition to open trade.   Much of the criticism is unwarranted. President Ernesto Zedillo, who took office only three weeks ago, had little choice; as foreign reserves dwindled, he could no longer afford to spend billions propping up the value of the peso.

The Mayor has given the Council a few days to draw up an acceptable new plan; if unsatisfied, he will proceed to cut on his own, as he must, by impounding funds.

Now a case from Louisiana gives the Court a chance to correct its own erratic course and preserve hard-won gains for minority voters.    The North Carolina decision was a stunning departure from the Court's earlier, more generous interpretations of the act. It suggested that district lines drawn to give North Carolina its first black Congressional representatives since Reconstruction represented a form of segregation, an American version of apartheid. That ruling, in turn, has since prompted lower courts to argue that race-conscious line-drawing that helps to integrate Congress is wrong because, in effect, it assigns voters to districts on a racial basis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941224","headline":"'Fledermaus' Pratfalls In Realist Settings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/24/arts/opera-review-fledermaus-pratfalls-in-realist-settings.html","abstract":"  The persistent lack of integrated dramatic thinking at the Metropolitan Opera has resulted in some peculiarly jumbled sights and sounds in recent years. Otto Schenk's eight-year-old production of \"Die Fledermaus,\" which returned on Thursday night, might set an in-house record for incoherence on a monumental scale. Here is a \"Fledermaus\" in which the cast sings in German and speaks in English; in which American sopranos drawl alongside crisp German baritones; in which crude comedic pratfalls are framed by grand realist settings, and in which an artist of the exalted international stature of Hermann Prey shares a stage with the comedian Dom DeLuise.   The inconsistencies of this production are by now familiar; nearly the whole cast on Thursday, Mr. Prey and Mr. DeLuise included, participated in the revivals of 1989 and 1991. There was, however, one startling new twist this time round: the trouser role of Prince Orlofsky was sung not by a mezzo-soprano but by a countertenor. When Jochen Kowalski entered in Act II with his ringing male contralto voice, the famous drunken party scene threatened to become a little too topsy-turvy for its own good.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941224","headline":"Sugarplums Add One To the Ranks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/24/arts/ballet-review-sugarplums-add-one-to-the-ranks.html","abstract":"  Debuts in principal roles continue to stud the New York City Ballet's \"Nutcracker,\" which introduced Jenifer Ringer as a new Sugarplum Fairy on Thursday night.

Drawing on archives in Dresden and Prague, Mr. Jenkins found works that have been heard on only a few occasions in recent centuries, if at all.   Both composers worked at the court of Elector Augustus the Strong in Dresden in the early 18th century, Heinichen as Kapellmeister, Zelenka as court composer. They were sharply opposed in temperament: Heinichen, all but forgotten until the Musica Antiqua Koln recorded his remarkable Dresden Concerti for DG last year, wrote in an extrovert, ornately inventive style, while Zelenka generally struck a more brooding and reflective tone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941224","headline":"Russians Say Rebel Center Is Encircled; Protests Rise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/24/world/russians-say-rebel-center-is-encircled-protests-rise.html","abstract":"  The Russian military reported that its forces had completed their encirclement of Grozny today in an attempt to isolate the besieged Chechen capital.

That increase drove New York City from 11th in 1980 to fifth in 1990 among cities with the biggest income disparities, and New York State from fifth to third among the states.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941225","headline":"Washington Closes A Visitor Center","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/25/travel/travel-advisory-washington-closes-a-visitor-center.html","abstract":"  The Washington Visitor Information Center, a drop-in site at 1455 Pennsylvania Avenue, has closed after losing its rent-free space.

He entered their lives brazenly, exited from them acrimoniously, and had intense relationships with both individuals in between. The result is \"a wickedly perceptive and daring book,\" James R. Mellow said here last year.  GHOSTS By John Banville. Vintage International, $11. The world of fine art becomes the world of fiction in this novel, which takes place on an unnamed island. All the characters are somehow interested in imagery -- the cast includes an art forger, a photographer and several art historians -- and all are not quite what they seem, including the narrator, who appeared in Mr. Banville's previous novel, \"The Book of Evidence.\" Last year our reviewer, Wendy Lesser, said, \"The achievement of 'Ghosts' is to use words as brushstrokes, to create in language an artwork that has all the appeal of a complex painting.\"  BIG BLUES: The Unmaking of IBM By Paul Carroll.

Winner of a National Book Award, this poem is a long ode to trash -- but it is also an autobiographical meditation and a reflection on humanity, which is, the poet points out not uncharitably, a form of garbage, too. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hirsch, said, \"In this major new installment to his life work, A. R. Ammons has given us an American testament.\" Mortality and trash are also subjects explored in THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI, by Italo Calvino, translated by Tim Parks (Vintage International, $10). In these five essays detailing his life and development as a writer, Calvino reflects on language and the significance of events like the disposal of rubbish, which he calls \"an offering made to the underworld.\" The book is \"a provocative reminder of how truly international\" Calvino's writing is, Lawrence Venuti said here last year.  FIMA By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange. Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.95.

LOVE, STARS, AND ALL THAT By Kirin Narayan. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10. This first novel describes the long pursuit of the perfect mate, beginning with a meeting in Berkeley, Calif., between the heroine, a graduate student from India, and a local poet. Earlier this year our reviewer, Bapsi Sidhwa, called it \"an engaging portrait.\"  VARIATIONS ON NIGHT AND DAY By Abdelrahman Munif. Translated by Peter Theroux. Vintage International, $12. Set in the 1930's in a fictional desert land that is obviously Saudi Arabia, this novel depicts the fortunes of Sultan Khureybit, a character patterned after the real desert chieftain and king Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. This final volume in the author's \"Cities of Salt\" trilogy allows the reader to \"get to know something of the desert itself,\" Fouad Ajami said here last year.

Jones, called \"Books and My Food: Literary Quotation and Recipes for Every Day in the Year.\" Naturally I turned to my birthday and read with pleasure: \" 'A dish of thick bread and scraped butter, a plate of hard biscuit, a teapot, and a glass milk-jug' -- Annie I.

The recipe, which I copied and promptly made at home, turned out to be a plain but reasonably dainty cracker, at least on Day 1.

Since then, life has become more complicated, certainly on the cookbook shelf. (Don't even ask about the Virginia Woolf shelf. By now a cookbook is the only thing that's missing.) The chosen genre of Cary and Jones -- food and literature -- has blossomed into a small jungle teeming with unlikely hybrids.

Readers looking for discussion of Hollywood's treatment of minorities or of its timorous or distored responses to momentous off-screen events, however, will be disappointed.

Poussin as Poet -- In the last rooms in the Poussin retrospective now at the Grand Palais in Paris, as one was feeling respectful of the brainy 17th-century French master but not passionate about him, something finally clicked. It happened in front of Virgilian scenes of Arcadia like \"Landscape With Diogenes\" and awesome tempests like \"Landscape With Pyramus and Thisbe\" and in front of a touching self-portrait that reveals the artist as poet. The Great Unveiling -- Michelangelo's \"Last Judgment\" in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the cleaning of which was completed last spring, finally revealed itself as a grand, unified composition instead of the patchwork quilt it had seemed before. Walking into the chapel, one is now struck by an image of brilliant color that sweeps the eye upward from hell to heaven, with the heroic figure of Christ as the anchor at the center.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941225","headline":"The Avenue of Splendor, Past and Present","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/25/style/on-the-street-the-avenue-of-splendor-past-and-present.html","abstract":"  Fifth Avenue is most brilliant when dressed for Christmas.

You can listen to Wagner's \"Faust\" Overture forward, backward, upside down or out on the veranda of the Villa Wahnfried, and it's still a pretty dubious piece.   And there is a corollary: great music is not exclusively produced by great composers. Think of \"Cavalleria Rusticana,\" \"The Planets,\" Korngold's \"Tote Stadt.\" Or, to go a little further astray, the Serenade for Orchestra by Wilhelm Stenhammar, a Swedish composer who lived from 1871 to 1927. This is music of effortless grace, sweet and sad in passing moods, spontaneous at every turn.

Our tours are available at all price levels, for individuals if desired, but most travelers come in pairs. Group rates begin at six people at Bulgarian hotels, and many of them throughout the country can offer, for virtually the same amount paid by Ms. Spano, self-contained rooms with breakfast, minus the threadbare carpets and cracked plaster.

And, there is the randomness of it, the fact that it can seemingly happen anyplace and at any time.

Once the forbidden deeds were done, the metal walls of Medea's palace fell to the ground with a crash, leaving her profiled against the racing clouds. It was the year's most stunning coup de theatre.

Albee Reborn -- Early in the first act of \"Three Tall Women,\" which opened at the Vineyard Theater in February, there was a jubilant moment when it became clear that Edward Albee had discovered a brilliant, barbed cosmic poetry in the wandering rhythms of a mean old woman's senile speech and that in the magnificent Myra Carter, he had just the right actress to put it across.

Joe Gunther, the square-jawed chief of detectives who keeps the peace in Brattleboro, Vt., in Archer Mayor's FRUITS OF THE POISONOUS TREE (Mysterious Press/Warner, $19.95), and Joe Kiley, the scrappy street cop from Chicago in Clark Howard's CITY BLOOD (Otto Penzler, $23), are a couple of genre specimens who would probably shoot each other on sight.

When prodded to give a reading at a lawn party, a scowling Dorothy Parker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) reels off her nasty meditation on suicide. \"Guns aren't lawful/ Nooses give/ Gas smells awful/ You might as well live,\" she intones in a punch-drunk voice that stops the party cold. Ms. Leigh's performance was exceptionally brave for being so relentlessly bitter. Although her portrayal may have been highly mannered, it was a convincing portrait of a lonely alcoholic malcontent with a viper's tongue. Best Performance in a Dress -- Terence Stamp's portrayal of Bernadette, an aging drag queen, in \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" had a witty mixed message about sexual identity and role playing. The oldest of a trio of transvestite entertainers traveling through the Australian outback, Bernadette personified genteel drag-queen hauteur. Yet Bernadette also shucked off her matronly airs long enough to rescue the trio from imminent peril. Echoes of Mr. Stamp as a dashing movie hero in the late 60's filtered through the women's clothing to suggest volumes about yin and yang.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941225","headline":"In a Sad Land, a Modest Feast In the Heart of Famine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/25/travel/christmas-road-mogadishu-jane-perlez-sad-land-modest-feast-heart-famine.html","abstract":"  If Christmas is a time for surprises, New York Times correspondents have had their share: along with the Japanese Santa and tree-trimming Muscovites there were the Serbian snipers, the bullets in Beirut, the tragic fire in Tennessee.

Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. In childhood I chose to identify with Jo, but who didn't? Of all the March girls, she was the most spirited, the most contemporary, the bravest. Being the terminally domestic Meg was out of the question. Beth was too good to be true and, besides, she died young. Amy, of course, was impossibly shallow. Still, someone who, in third grade, sometimes stuck a pencil through the bridge of her glasses in a bizarre effort to straighten a slight bump on her nose could not afford to scorn someone who wore a clothespin on hers. Amy's fondness for using big words she could not pronounce was mine, too. And I would have been just as reluctant to give up my breakfast to the Hummels.    \"Little Women\" showed up under my Christmas tree, as it did under hundreds of thousands of Christmas trees, soon after I learned how to read. A lot of other Alcotts came later, and if a few years ago I bought a pair of bronze-colored shoes that I have never yet worn, it is because they reminded me of some I had read about in \"Rose in Bloom.\" The other Alcotts, however, were recognizably fiction.

The ruling, based on the State Constitution, is correct.   Though denounced as \"social engineering\" by a losing lawyer, the decision merely recognizes modern reality. Like a company town where the company sets the rules, commercial enclaves are in effect small governments; they must allow reasonable communicative acts by customers and visitors, while retaining the right to set fair terms that govern when and where the right of speech may be exercised.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941226","headline":"Blast Victims Said to Face Long Struggle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/26/nyregion/blast-victims-said-to-face-long-struggle.html","abstract":"  Some lie in a narcotic haze, waiting until their seared lungs can breathe without help from machines.

Judge Dwyer's decision represented a rare victory for the Administration in what has otherwise been a tough year for environmental initiatives. President Clinton promised during his campaign to find a negotiated solution to a vitriolic battle between loggers and conservationists over the old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, where years of ferocious logging had threatened the habitat for the northern spotted owl -- the little bird that provoked the whole controversy -- and other species, including salmon.

These are nicknames for two mass-produced housing estates that are still in excellent condition even though they were built from 1925 to 1932, the year before Hitler grabbed power and inexorably destroyed Weimar democracy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941226","headline":"Some Roses Brighten UpCourt Date For a Wife","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/26/nyregion/some-roses-brighten-upcourt-date-for-a-wife.html","abstract":"  Christmas was much like any other day in the arraignment section of Criminal Court in Manhattan.
