In October 1945, while I was aiding Holocaust survivors for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Linz, Austria, Oskar Schindler asked for and received our help, based on documents that he had saved hundreds of Jews by giving them employment in his factory in Cracow -- verified to me by survivors. Schindler expressed to me his fear of the revenge of the Nazis, and therefore wanted help to obtain work in Bavaria, where he thought it would be safer because United States occupation troops would be there for some time to come.   \"Schindler's List,\" Thomas Keneally's book, refers to what happened in 1963, when Schindler was hissed on the streets of Frankfurt and even had to pay damages to a German worker he punched for calling him a \"Jew kisser.\" Bitter irony that in 1994, as you point out, fear of Nazi revenge has not been eradicated.   Mr. Keneally's book accurately reports that in 1949 the Joint Distribution Committee gave Schindler financial aid for his nutria farm in Argentina, which failed, and in 1959 for his cement factory in Frankfurt, which also failed.    These modest gestures of support were by no means compensation for Schindler's heroic achievements, but, long before Mr. Keneally and Mr. Spielberg made Oskar Schindler's name an international byword, the American Jewish community demonstrated its gratitude to this unusual man.

But the Islanders' defenseman Scott Lachance was called for high sticking with 2:19 left, forcing the Islanders to play a man short at a crucial point in the game.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940310","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/10/style/chronicle-423246.html","abstract":"  A downtown boy: SUSANNE BARTSCH, whose name is always followed by a tag like party promoter, party giver or partygoer, and her fiance, DAVID BARTON, owner of the Chelsea gym that bears his name, have a son, BAILEY BARTSCH BARTON, born last Wednesday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940310","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/10/style/chronicle-423254.html","abstract":"  It was reunion time for ALICIA DE LARROCHA and two old friends, VAN CLIBURN and VICTORIA DE LOS ANGELES, at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday evening after Miss de Larrocha's performance of the Ravel Piano Concerto with the New York Philharmonic.

A burly, crew-cut Ralph Meeker plays Mike Hammer, Spillane's tough-guy alter ego, with a blank muscularity that suggests the young Marlon Brando with his soul burned out of him.   In \"Kiss Me Deadly,\" assorted thugs, molls and law officers chase each other around the city, casually knocking each other off in a frantic search that makes \"The Maltese Falcon\" seem like a genteel scavenger hunt.

But more than two million of those do not collect because they do not know about it. Tens of millions more low-paid workers could receive the tax refund as part of their monthly paycheck, rather than waiting for a lump-sum payment at the end of the year, but do not know to apply for this \"advanced payment\" option. The Clinton Administration took an important step this week when it instructed Cabinet secretaries and agency heads to notify Federal employees about the option.    Private employers must also make sure their low-paid workers know about the credit. The earned income tax credit is a nearly ideal anti-poverty weapon. It lifts families above poverty, and rewards work because the credit is tied to earnings. Workers earning less than $23,755 are eligible for a credit that reaches a maximum of $2,500 a year. Under the advanced payment option, as much as $100 a month is added to a worker's paychecks. To get advanced payment, workers need only fill out form W-5 from the Internal Revenue Service, which requires answering four straightforward yes-or-no questions.   The Clinton Administration fought hard to raise the tax credit during last year's bruising budget battle. It was the first of a series of steps to eliminate poverty in families with full-time workers. Congress obliged. But many go without money they are due. It is up to employers everywhere to notify workers about Congress's good deed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940311","headline":"John Bobbitt Takes to the Road And Finds It Strewn With Cash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/us/john-bobbitt-takes-to-the-road-and-finds-it-strewn-with-cash.html","abstract":"  Both of the Bobbitts may have been through hell, but their lawyers are working hard to find them rewards after the traumas of the bedroom and the courtroom.

The idea has an explicit, often moving reality at the Museum of American Folk Art, where 50 of Phillips's stiffly elegant paintings create an early American portrait gallery.    Again and again, Phillips's flattened, hard-edged, meticulously detailed style, developed without benefit of academic training, seems to get to the heart of the matter, to capture the essence of his subjects and their lives with quietly joyous artifice, freezing them in an almost Egyptian stillness. In the plain dress and plainer backgrounds, one senses the honesty and unpretentiousness of a new democracy, as well as its isolation from the northern European culture that spawned it. In the calm, dignified faces that shine forth from the dark brown or black, dramatized by collars or fine lace bonnets of radiant white, one encounters an unsettling mixture of tensed charm and steely will.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940311","headline":"I.R.A RAID CALLED NO BAR TO TALKS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/world/ira-raid-called-no-bar-to-talks.html","abstract":"  British and Irish leaders said today that the search for peace in Northern Ireland would go on despite the I.R.A. attack at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday evening in which four mortar shells were fired at a runway but did not explode.

Following hot on the heels of an impressive \"Art Show,\" it proves almost as solid in quality of material and even greater in range.    Range in this case means 95 dealers offering everything from Old Master drawings to contemporary prints and generous helpings of photography. The bounty is further swelled by an unusually high proportion of works in painterly media like pastel (lovely Joan Mitchells), watercolor (landscapes by the 19th-century French artist Paul Huet), gouache (a sweet little Milton Avery pig, among others) and even a thickly painted oil-on-paper by Edwin Dickinson.   One can get the clearest sense of paper's versatility simply by taking a rubbernecking walk through this huge, diverse show. Spanierman Gallery is a good place to start, with a beautiful selection of American late-19th-century work. Two 1916 etchings at Sylvan Cole nearby -- Childe Hassam's stately skyscrapers and John Marin's tipsy, punched-in Woolworth Building -- show the generational divide as American art got the message of modernism.    There are some smart one-artist installations -- notably of Hans Bellmer's mid-1930's photographs at Adam J. Boxer and of Man Ray's Dada photographs at One Bond Masterworks -- and a good mix of Old Master work, with concentrations on mid-18th-to-19th-century European artists still under known on these shores.    Given the sheer variety at hand, though, viewers can write their own tickets as to what they want to see. One can approach the show looking for humor, in the subtle caricatures of artists by Francois Andre Vincent (1746-1816), for example; or for inspiration: an 18th-century chalk drawing of the nude muse of poetry might do. And it is possible to customize any number of esoteric theme tours: of things that grow in the ground, say (botanical prints and Emil Nolde's \"Red Poppies\"), or of things that fly (Audubon engravings and children's book illustrations with more fairies and angels than you can count).   Most memorable, though, are individual images that hold the eye just that extra second or two: the red chalk head of a sleepy child by Jakob Mathias Schmutzer (1733-1811) at Nocolas Joly/Yves Mikaeloff, a Daubigny pencil landscape at Stoppenbach and Delestre, and a mysterious little drawing at Hill-Stone by Battista Franco (circa 1510-56) in which skulls, human and animal, form a pattern as intricate and threadlike as a textile design.    One might wish for work by young contemporary artists and a little cultural diversity (one gallery has Japanese prints, another Indian miniatures; otherwise, it is Euro-North American all the way), but this is a fascinating and unusually lively show: a paper trail, in short, definitely worth following.

Part of the opera's appeal is its source, James M. Cain's 1934 novel. That book's sharply etched plot and hard-boiled, flat-voiced irony has spawned a small entertainment industry, inspiring at least four filmed versions (two of them American) and a classic French novel (Camus said it was a model for \"The Stranger\"). The melodramatic story of a ne'er-do-well drifter, Frank Chambers, who stops in at a roadside diner run by Nick, a good-natured Greek immigrant, and ends up plotting his murder with Cora, Nick's lusty hellcat wife, sizzles with menace, eroticism and brutality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940311","headline":"Disney Can Make American History Fun; 'We Cannot Consecrate'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/opinion/l-disney-can-make-american-history-fun-we-cannot-consecrate-435040.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I agree with you on the potential \"Disneyfication\" of Prince William County (editorial, Feb. 24).
