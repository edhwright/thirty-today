Is it possible to write it? Certainly, great literature might come out of the lives of ordinary people on the farms and ranches and little towns of the Great Plains, but are the people who farm, the people working in those towns, writing it? The truth, the whole truth, tends to be complex, its contentments and joys wrestled out of doubt, pain, change. How to tell the truth in a small town, where, if a discouraging word is heard, it is not for public consumption?   Like many who have written about the Dakotas, I'm invigorated by the harsh beauty of the land and feel a need to tell the stories that come from its soil. Writing is a solitary act, and, ideally, the Dakotas might seem to provide a writer with ample solitude and quiet. But the frantic social activity in small towns conspires to silence a person. There are far fewer people than jobs to fill. Someone must be found to lead the church choir or youth group, to bowl with the league, to coach a softball team or Little League, to run a Chamber of Commerce or club committee. Many jobs are vital: the volunteer fire department and ambulance service, the domestic violence hot line, the food bank. But all too often a kind of Tom Sawyerism takes over, and makes of adult life a perpetual club.

A Biography of the Gentleman Director, by Patrick McGilligan. (Harper Perennial, $13.) George Cukor was one of the first great Hollywood directors, and one of the first in the film industry to encounter its sometimes virulent homophobia. This book shows how he managed to occupy a niche in two very different worlds. Last year our reviewer, Andrew Sarris, called it \"that rarity of rarities among Hollywood biographies: a full-bodied study of a man and his metier, equally insightful about the life and the art.\"     SUGAR: And Other Stories, by A. S. Byatt. (Vintage International, $10.) This collection of short fiction by the author of \"Possession\" includes characters who are witches and ghosts, although it is well grounded in the real world of emotions and morals. \"At her best, Antonia Byatt is elegant in the tradition of James and Forster, and her concerns are the enduring ones: the tenacity of the past and the clutch of family, the struggle for freedom and self-definition, and the quest for substantive truth in the shadow of death,\" Lynne Sharon Schwartz said here in 1987. Vintage International has also brought back into print the author's 1967 novel, THE GAME ($10), the story of two English sisters, opposites in personality, who have been involved with the same man. In 1968 our reviewer, Martin Levin, said, \"What is so admirable about Mrs. Byatt's treatment of her characters is her blending of what they are with what they believe.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"Inaugu-Wear for Sale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/style/inaugu-wear-for-sale.html","abstract":"  It must have been a slow news day.

The menu consisted mostly of dishes based on the composer's own recipes. The party was in Paris because Rossini spent the last 45 years of his life there, gourmandizing more than composing. The occasion was the release of an eight-CD album of the five early Rossini one-act comic operas.   Unfortunately, the performances, while amiable and honorable, are not top-drawer. And that pretty much sums up the record industry's response to this Rossini year: surprisingly few new recordings, especially from the major labels, and only a couple of them first rate.

Omnipotent aliens arrive on Earth with an offer that sounds impossible to refuse: immortality for all.

Ethan Mordden's RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN (Abrams, $45) examines the team's output on a show-by-show basis, with the benefit of the author's encyclopedic knowledge of musical theater. He discusses each show in the context of other Broadway developments, both before and since its premiere. According to Mr. Mordden, with Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the writing of the script became the fundamental act of composition\" and \"the musical-comedy composer and the operetta lyricist developed a 'healing' art as interested in discussing the advantages of community or analyzing the nature of love as in entertaining.\" Mr. Mordden, a prolific writer on the theater, argues that \"State Fair,\" the team's only original film score, is \"the one dud of their 17-year career,\" \"Pipe Dream\" is their \"only bomb\" and \"Carousel\" is their \"masterpiece.\" He also contends persuasively that \"Allegro\" deserves another look because it paved the way for the more contemporary \"concept\" musicals further developed by Michael Bennett and Stephen Sondheim. Mr. Mordden's approach may finally be more celebratory than critical. But given the enduring appeal of Rodgers and Hammerstein's creations, we're inclined to sing along.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"A Drag?

David Noel Freedman, editor in chief. (Six volumes, Doubleday, $360.) This monumental (7,035 pages) and truly ecumenical work brings together the efforts of nearly 1,000 contributors in entries, some of them at essay length, on innumerable major and minor biblical topics.   LEMPRIERE'S DICTIONARY, by Lawrence Norfolk. (Harmony, $22.)    Not    a dictionary but a first novel, droll, ferocious and intricate, set in the late 18th century, treating of a young man whose life is sidetracked by Ovidian myths and other irruptions.   LINCOLN: An Illustrated Biography, by Philip B. Kunhardt Jr., Philip B. Kunhardt 3d and Peter W. Kunhardt. (Knopf, $50.) Powerful images, mostly from the authors' family's archives, dominate this companion volume to ABC's Lincoln documentary.   THE ART OF CELEBRATION: Twentieth-Century Painting, Literature, Sculpture, Photography, and Jazz, by Alfred Appel Jr. (Knopf, $35.) Modern times aren't all Eliot and Kafka, the author cheerfully argues; there's also Joyce, Nabokov, Matisse, Astaire, Chaplin, Teddy Wilson and a whole raft of dedicated life affirmers.   THE BOY WITHOUT A FLAG: Tales of the South Bronx, by Abraham Rodriguez Jr. (Milkweed Editions, paper, $11.) A first book of fiction, in which brutality is controlled by sophistication.   THE PORCUPINE, by Julian Barnes. (Knopf, $17.) A short, edgy, gloomy political novel in which a well-meaning Eastern European prosecutor learns that the fall of the old system has brought not energy and purpose but an ironically bourgeois alienation.   NEW AND SELECTED POEMS, by Mary Oliver. (Beacon, $20.) The winner of a National Book Award this year, Ms. Oliver's volume offers the precise, intelligent work of 30 years.

Of Joe Clark and Steve Muller, each 11 years old, together rowing a boat with a piece of wood and a shovel to get people from one end of their street to the other as the water swelled to flood level three days in a row.

Trees, ornaments, photo albums and presents not to mention appliances, heaters, floors, walls, couches, toys, even the cat food, went right out with the storm. \n\nThe images that will really stick for so many are of neighbor supporting neighbor: Of Faith Overby making a huge pot of clam chowder, donning mud-crusted boots and going house to house, delivering steaming bowls to friends still without heat and electricity five days after the storm. Of Joe Clark and Steve Muller, each 11 years old, together rowing a boat with a piece of wood and a shovel to get people from one end of their street to the other as the water swelled to flood level three days in a row. And of Dave Dyer wading through waist-deep water during the height of the storm to help firefighters rescue an elderly couple from their home as their basement burned, then going back into the waters after a neighbor's dog. \nThe Meaning of Christmas\n\n \"I was so depressed after the storm and we didn't lose what other people lost,\" Ms. Overby said. \"To look outside and see all the mud, all the mattresses being thrown out, the furniture, the appliances, the kids' toys.

Yet BACCARAT (Abrams, $95), glossily luxurious though it may appear, is curiously lacking in substance, organization and purpose. The photographs, by Jacques Boulay and Jean-Michel Tardy, are grainy and not lustrous. The cursory and very brief text by the French Academician Jean-Louis Curtis tells the basic facts about this illustrious company, tracing its history from its founding in 1764 by the Bishop of Metz, who recognized France's potential to compete with Bohemian artisans in creative glass design and manufacture. Swiftly we are told of the various interruptions at the factory due to political upheavals and wars, and about the reorganizations after such interludes. There is little mentioned about why particular designs were favored, nor is there explanation of why 19th-century society desired or required such elaborate crystal. The oversize photographs are not arranged chronologically, and the placement of most of the captions makes identification very difficult. An incomplete but useful glossary at the end of the book makes the reader wish that such information had been included throughout the text, describing more fully the objects themselves and using the objects in turn as examples. Two pages from an early Baccarat catalogue illustrate the elaborate ornamentation of a tableware service, but nowhere in the book is such a service described in detail or illustrated by photographs. For most of us, such information would have been most useful, since we might conceivably own a set of table crystal, but probably not a crystal Medici vase, scrolled, gadrooned and mounted on gilded bronze lion claws.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"Offering Immigrants From Russia Insights on Life in America","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/nyregion/offering-immigrants-from-russia-insights-on-life-in-america.html","abstract":"  THE spirited discussion, which covered the Iran-contra affair, former President Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal, the Communist Party, tensions in Crown Heights and the jury system, was nearly as biting as the bitter cold on a chilly Sunday morning.

The Giants were inconsistent and overly generous. They were lethargic, then sharp, then almost asleep, and they lost, 20-10, to an Eagles team that played with more intensity.   So the Giants finished this disastrous season with a 6-10 record that almost surely will lead to Ray Handley's dismissal after two years as the head coach. The Eagles finished with four straight victories, an 8-0 season at home and an 11-5 record over all.

For the Miami seniors, who could play a part in a third such championship for the school within four seasons and a fifth within 10, the longer-lasting achievement might come next spring, when their class of football players has the chance to establish a 100 percent graduation rate among the 19 seniors on scholarship. That would be 41 percent higher than the performance of the football class that arrived at the school in 1984, according to figures used by the College Football Association. A Different Breed    But Miami's football players haven't just apparently improved their ways in the classroom.
