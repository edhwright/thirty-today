Many other eligible voters did not even make it onto the rolls, while numerous dead people did. Former President Jose Napoleon Duarte and former Constituent Assembly President Roberto D'Aubuisson -- both dead -- were on the rolls.

The setting is a shtetl near the eastern border of Poland (the film was shot in a real shtetl in Ukraine), but the imagery has a peculiar and incongruous glamour. Life is languid and slow. Characters are voluptuous, even when the realities of their existence are ominous and harsh. In this atmosphere, a wife responds amorously when her husband embraces her, even though she happens to be busy scrubbing the floor.   Ms. Zauberman uses this intoxicating manner to tell the story of Abraham (Roma Aleksandrovitch), his family and his neighbors, who reflect varying political changes that are in the offing. Nachman (Rolan Bykov), Abraham's grandfather, is the estate manager for a brooding, world-weary Prince (Oleg Iankovski) who presides over the region until his money runs out. Rachel (Maria Lipkina), Abraham's sister, is in love with Aaron (Vladimir Machkov), who is a member of the illegal Communist party.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940323","headline":"At Play on the Fields of War","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/23/sports/IHT-at-play-on-the-fields-of-war.html","abstract":"A soccer game played beneath skies patrolled by fighter planes does not signify peace in Sarajevo.

At least one-fourth of those who were unable to cross in time were left stranded by at least one lane of traffic, according to a report in the current issue of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.   In the study, Dr. Russell E. Hoxie and Dr. Laurence Z.

Limon, who died in 1972, had his feet firmly planted on the ground and his eyes turned upward. But this first program of the Limon Dance Company's two-week season at the Joyce opened a door -- through \"Mazurkas\" and an eloquent performance of the Limon classic \"The Moor's Pavane\" -- onto a different world than that of the brainy, stylish, hyperactive modern dance of the 1990's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"Italy's Knight in Teflon: Tycoon Repulses Charges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/world/italy-s-knight-in-teflon-tycoon-repulses-charges.html","abstract":"  The candidate had been touching the bases -- the soccer set in Milan, the disco set in Rome, the homemakers, the aristocrats, the Chief Rabbi.

The work was commissioned by the orchestra, and the performance was its world premiere.   Mr. Ge was born in Shanghai in 1954 and began his training there, completing it at Columbia University. Like Bright Sheng, Chen Yi and Tan Dun, composers with similar biographies, Mr. Ge comes to Western instrumentation and compositional forms with fresh ears. His rhapsody alludes to Chinese timbres, most notably in occasional sliding string figures and in passages for wood blocks. Chinese propulsive techniques are used, too: in one particularly moving section, a solid, full-orchestra chord is repeated at an increasing tempo, an effect drawn from Chinese opera.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"One by One, Marquees Light Up As Spring Comes to Broadway","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/theater/one-by-one-marquees-light-up-as-spring-comes-to-broadway.html","abstract":"  It's almost April, and as sure a sign of spring as any is that old bear Broadway, lumbering out from under its snow blanket and blinking itself awake just in time for the Tony Award nominations. Winter, always the sleepiest time of the Broadway season, has been especially so this year, with the biggest news -- \"Show Boat\" ushers in the $75 ticket! Glenn Close replaces Patti LuPone in \"Sunset Boulevard\"! -- concerning shows not due until fall. And as has been the pattern the last several years, the season's final month will be its busiest, with 12 shows opening before the Tony deadline on May 11, beginning tonight with \"Carousel\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center.   Up to now, what kind of season has it been? Well, not too good. The consensus, in the words of Alan Wasser, the general manager of three Broadway musicals, is \"it's been slow, no question, both in terms of production and in terms of attendance.\" As in the last few seasons, he said, \"you reach March and nothing much has happened, and then there's a handful of things coming in that everyone pins their hopes on.\" Signs of Hope    Nonetheless, there are some positive notes. All but 2 of Broadway's 35 theaters have had or will have a booking this season. And despite the worst winter weather in memory, compared to the situation last year at this time, the number of total productions is up (to 24 from 19), attendance is about even (right around 6 million) and total receipts, more than $266 million, are up slightly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"Parcells Seeks a Giant Look","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/sports/pro-football-parcells-seeks-a-giant-look.html","abstract":"  Bill Parcells is not only trying to acquire current Giants players, he is also going after some former Giants as well.

But panic would be exactly the wrong response in either country.

The dreamy story is set in 1955, when Mr. Cohen went to his first game, at Yankee Stadium, and the ball landed near his seat. - The show, which includes the original pastels of the book's illustrations and Mr. Cohen's larger baseball paintings of Mickey Mantle, Roy Campanella and Babe Ruth, reveals Mr. Cohen's working process: the text is in sequence on one wall, while on another are drafts and final versions of the drawings.   Children can also see baseball gloves and mitts handmade by the Sports Doctor, who is actually John Golomb, based in Rocky Hill, N.J. Baseball memorabilia is on loan from Scrivener's Collectibles in Maplewood.   Mr. Cohen will sign his books, priced at $15, tomorrow from 1 to 3 P.M.

Unless they choose a field of study in high demand, graduate school is not a simple solution.   Indeed, a graduate degree can lessen the chance of finding a job if one does not have substantial experience beforehand. The experience trap is such that most positions that require a master's degree also require two years of experience. Entry-level positions that would enable one to gain experience require only a bachelor's degree. Thus companies are reluctant to consider applicants with advanced degrees because they are perceived as overqualified.   Times of structural shifts in the economy highlight the deficiency of a market economy in matching employees with employers. From an economic standpoint, unemployment and underemployment reduce the productive potential of the economy. From a human perspective, a spiral of rejection can lead to destruction of self-esteem.    Young people leave college with self-confidence, believing they can help change the world. At the end of the humiliating job search they wonder if they can change a light bulb.   Other than through contacts and unethical insider information, the prime way people look for jobs is through newspaper want ads. Many newspapers have yet to enter the computer age, except for a few like your Fast Track service. It is time consuming for applicants to sift through the want ads and for businesses to go through hundreds of resumes. Computerized searches using new software would greatly increase the efficiency of matching applicants with employers.   Therefore, Congress ought to speed approval of the computerized national jobs bank contained in the Clinton Administration's job retraining plan. Putting jobs on line maximizes both economic efficiency and social justice, which cannot be said of too many things.

In a case that adoption experts said was unusual and potentially precedent-setting, Mr. Merrick was sued by his wife from whom he is estranged after he decided at the last minute in 1989 not to go through with adopting two young children. His wife, Etan, 32 years younger than her husband, contends that he had gone too far in the adoption proceedings to back out.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940325","headline":"Pressure Whom?: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/25/opinion/IHT-pressure-whom-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Help Macedonia Pressure Greece if Necessary\" (March 18, Opinion) by George Soros:.Greece has earned its place in the world through heavy sacrifices, both human and material, throughout its history.

Tashkin advocates medicinal use of dronabinol, a synthetic cannabinoid in capsule form, instead of smoked cannabis. Most patients who have compared smoked cannabis with dronabinol say that smoking is always more effective. Variations in the absorption of oral cannabis from the digestive tract make it difficult to control the dose. Also, people who suffer from nausea and vomiting find it difficult to take cannabis orally.   Dr. Tashkin reviews some concerns about the long-term effects of cannabis smoking on the lungs. After studying cannabis more than 25 years, I have come to believe, largely due to Dr. Tashkin's work, that pulmonary effects are the only well-documented harm from long-term cannabis use. I believe his letter exaggerates this, but it has little to do with use of cannabis as a medicine.   I would share Dr. Tashkin's concern if medical cannabis users had to smoke many cigarettes a day. But most people who use cannabis as a medicine (for multiple sclerosis, AIDS weight loss syndrome, migraine headaches, epilepsy, menstrual tension, nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy) need a few puffs to relieve symptoms.    Patients who use some of the newer, more potent strains of marijuana need to inhale even less noxious smoke. Dr. David B. Busch of the Department of Environmental and Toxicologic Pathology has demonstrated, examining lung cells, that sinsemilla, a potent form, has fewer of the pulmonary effects Dr. Tashkin describes than standard varieties.    Water pipes can also filter carcinogen substances in marijuana, a practice the Government unfortunately discourages. When marijuana becomes available as a medicine, we should see even more efficient ways to separate noxious from useful constituents of the smoke.   Dr. Tashkin's cautions should be taken seriously in some contexts, but they have little relevance to the use of smoked cannabis as a medicine.
