Norcross, general counsel to the Republican National Committee, that was hand-delivered to the 38 House Republicans who voted earlier this year for a ban on assault weapons.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940811","headline":"Specter of Segregation Returns; Montclair Schools Are Troubled by Racial Imbalance Among Classrooms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/11/nyregion/specter-segregation-returns-montclair-schools-are-troubled-racial-imbalance.html","abstract":"  If ever a town labored for integration, it is Montclair. Since a 1968 court desegregation order, this suburban enclave has struggled mightily for racial balance in its schools and to keep its neighborhoods stable.   The effort had seemed successful. After a painful interlude of forced busing, the district created a magnet-school program that averted white flight and induced parents to send their children to school across town. Montclair became integration Eden, a model for other districts and a haven for young families seeking a solid education in a multi-ethnic town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940811","headline":"Tainted Gifts to Mr. Espy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/11/opinion/tainted-gifts-to-mr-espy.html","abstract":"  It is getting harder and harder to pick up a newspaper without finding fresh evidence that some public officials never learn. The latest example of the failure of senior government employees to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest is the reported misbehavior of Mike Espy, President Clinton's Secretary of Agriculture.   Mr. Espy runs a department that has long been cozy with the food producers and farmers it is supposed to regulate. President Clinton promised to end these snug relationships throughout the executive branch, but Mr. Espy appears not to have heard him. Instead, according to The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times, Mr. Espy accepted small favors from companies his department oversees while ignoring abuses in the poultry industry. Among his patrons is Tyson Foods, the big Arkansas chicken producer with strong personal and political ties to Mr. and Mrs. Clinton.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940811","headline":"Zezel Is Part of Compensation to Stars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/11/sports/sports-people-hockey-zezel-is-part-of-compensation-to-stars.html","abstract":"  The Dallas Stars have received center PETER ZEZEL and right wing GRANT MARSHALL from the Toronto Maple Leafs as compensation for the Leafs' signing of MIKE CRAIG, a free-agent right wing.

Following his own infallible whimsies, Messiaen chose to pay homage to the canyons and birds of Utah. Although the state responded gratefully by naming one of its peaks Mount Messiaen, the work is less a portrait of a particular landscape than of the richness of the mind contemplating it. Against the austerity of the canyons, Messiaen unleashed an orgy of exotic instrumentation: trumpeters play with wa-wa mutes and mouthpieces alone, the solo pianist draws resonances from silently depressed clusters, the percussionists wield a sand drum and a very prominent wind machine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940811","headline":"Kin Feuding Over Girl Hurt in Father's Suicide","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/11/nyregion/kin-feuding-over-girl-hurt-in-father-s-suicide.html","abstract":"  As a critically injured Belarussian girl lies sedated in Bellevue Hospital Center, her feuding mother and grandmother are each on their way to claim her, setting the battleground for a tangled custody dispute.

STATEMENT BY SENATOR ROCKEFELLER    We're all here to confront problems, not to pretend that they don't exist. We're all here to represent the people of our states as part of the same union, bound together as a nation. And now we have reached this moment when we confront a problem called health care in America. In our wake are years and years of speeches about the crisis of rising health care costs and diminishing health care coverage.                    . . .         We've reached out in terms of making alliances not mandatory but voluntary; we've stretched out the time line. If there is ever to be a mandate, it will never happen until the next century, and only then under certain circumstances, only if the Congress doesn't follow the orders of the commission.   We have reached out. But . . . this does have to be a two-way process. We cannot constantly be reaching out and out and more and more, and then nothing comes back. So it's very hard to reach agreement that way.    So here we are with our years of speeches about this crisis. This debate begins after, as you go over the years, I would say virtually thousands of hearings here in Congress, certainly tens of thousands of hearings. There've been public meetings at our homes and visits that all of us have had with people of our states, hundreds of reports, hundreds of studies and commissions, mountains. They fill cabinets in everyone's offices and in distant chambers somewhere in this complex, telling us some of the grim facts about health care in America. Emphasis on Realism    We have to be realistic. The Senator from Minnesota spoke about the fact that we let the market work. That's one of the compromises that Senator Mitchell has made in his bill, is to give more time for the market to work.   But I have to point out to my friends on the other side that the Department of Labor has recently indicated that workers who are insured, who have insurance through their jobs, that their number dropped from 66 percent to 61 percent over the last 10 years, and that the trend is downward under the voluntary system.   That means, Mr. President, that 5.5 million more working insured Americans are now uninsured. The market system works in different sectors in different ways. Does it work perfectly in health care? I'm afraid not.   At some point we have to draw on everything that we have learned from the experts, from our own constituents and from our own souls, and decide on the actual steps that will solve as much of the problem as we possibly can this year.    With the health care plan submitted by the majority leader, we now have that opportunity. This is a bill that tries to achieve the major goals of health care reform in ways that will work and that we can afford and that are fair.   The majority leader can only offer the rest of us the opportunity to act; he has no powers further than that. Then it's up to us.                    . . .         If too many senators treat this debate upcoming as only a chance to score points one against the other, one party against the other, their win is the American people's loss. If too many senators also stay stuck on the idea that we should hold off one more time, until next month or next year or the next election, their delay dashes the hopes of millions of Americans, many in my state, that are now thinking maybe, just maybe, something will soon happen here to help them with their health care nightmares. STATEMENT BY SENATOR KERREY    The question before us is whether or not we have the capacity to bridge the differences between Republicans and Democrats and pass a bill that is urgently needed by the people, urgently needed.                    . . .         There truly are people in America watching now, hoping that this debate gets interesting, and hoping that the debate, as a consequence of getting interesting, leads to a finished product, the enactment of legislation. The question before us is, Can we bridge the differences? . . .   It is true that we are dealing with a seventh of the U.S. economy. It is true that we are dealing with something that's life and death for the American people, and so we need to give it our full and serious consideration. We're prepared to do that. Demand for Care    Many of us, indeed I would say most of us, have spent a great deal of time studying this issue, a great deal of time at home looking at the problems that are there. It is, as the President said, bankrupting this country. There will be a $38 billion increase from last year to this year just in Federal spending for health care -- $38 billion. . . .   It is a tremendous amount of money, and the President of the U.S., when he started this thing, said it's bankrupting America, and it is bankrupting businesses and, increasingly, it's bankrupting families.   Why? Well, in part we're demanding expensive health care. Not very many of us walk in and say, \"Could you give me the cheapest thing you've got.\"                    . . .         We've gone from a point in 1950 where 80 percent of the bills were paid with cash; today, 80 percent is either socialized through the Government or it's socialized through insurance. Eighty percent have our health care bills paid for by someone else. And it's a consequence that most of us don't even know what the price is. And most of us in this body need to be reminded that, for tens of millions of Americans, even having a baby can be a financial catastrophe.   Mr. President, it costs $12,000 to have a baby in this city. Imagine that, $12,000. That's two-day normal vaginal delivery. Now the insurance companies only pay for a day. Two-day normal delivery, $12,000.   Mr. President, my babies were born 19 and 17 years ago, and I paid cash. I didn't have to be insured 20 years ago. Why? Because having a baby wasn't a financial catastrophe if you weren't insured.   We have driven increased demand into the system. In order to provide coverage for individuals, in order to reach out and help individuals pay the bills, we've driven increased demand into the system. The price goes up, the requirement for increased subsidies occurs as a consequence.                    . . .         There are tens of millions of Americans out there who do not have the capacity to pay the bills, who are forced to ingratiate themselves, to remain on welfare before they are told that they're eligible. All of us feel that there's a problem in America. We can see the gaps and differentials that separate Republicans and Democrats, and my sincere hope and prayer is that the momentum that seems to have stopped, that seems to have caused lots of us to say, \"Well, I'm not sure we're going to get a bill\" ----   I hope that we are able in a quiet moment to acquire the humility necessary to see that the American people are counting on us to set aside our differences and enact legislation this year. It is urgently needed. And we ought to do the best we can and get a bill to the President of the United States so that he can sign it on behalf of millions of Americans who are hoping and praying that we are able to get the job done.  STATEMENT BY SENATOR DOMENICI    I want to talk a little bit about health care reform and the Federal budget.   Now, why would I do that? Because essentially, whether we like it or not, we are going to be voting on legislation that has a big effect on our children and grandchildren in terms of the budget of the United States, whether we are still in enormous deficit position, whether we are still unable to pay our bills as a nation.   And thus, in a very real sense, the effect on the Federal budget of this plan -- and any major plan -- is of extreme importance, and we ought to try our best up front to understand.   It not so easy because we are sending new things to those who make the estimates all the time. Evidence of that today when every section in this bill has been changed, and yet we had some estimated costs in here the day before yesterday. . . . So we must be careful not to saddle our young people and to burden future generations with today's health care costs.                    . . .         There is no more compelling case for controlling health care costs than their current and projected impact on the Federal budget. Indeed, one of the most critical issues facing the country is continued growth of open-ended mandatory spending in the Federal budget. That is, you create a situation where a citizen is entitled as a matter of law to benefits and if you don't pay them, they can enforce it in a court of law. That's the definition of an entitlement. And this is led today by Medicare and Medicaid and the resulting growth in budget deficits. . . .   New Entitlements    These new entitlements will bring millions of Americans onto the Federal Government's subsidy program, and let me give you the best estimates I can there.   An estimated 100 million Americans will be eligible for Senator Mitchell's premium subsidies alone, not counting the long-term care, which is a new program with new beneficiaries, and other entitlements in this bill. I am not counting them; I am only counting the recipients of subsidies in whole or in part from insurance premiums.   And what's most alarming to me is the growth rate of these new entitlement programs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new premium subsidy program will grow over 10 percent a year even after it is phased in.   So if we thought we had things under control and we're getting them there with new health care reform admittedly, right up front the Congressional Budget Office warns us that these subsidy programs will grow at a rate of 10 percent a year even after they are phased in. The Medicare drug benefit, a brand new one, grows at 10.5 percent a year even after phased in. The long-term-care program grows 44 percent a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office once it's in full effect.   So I don't think there can be any mistake about it: The Mitchell-Clinton bill, under the guise of health care reform, will create several new open-ended, runaway entitlement programs. STATEMENT BY SENATOR CHAFEE    I want to say I'm delighted we're moving into this health reform legislation this week. It's very complicated, but I think it's time for us to do the best we can do struggle for constructive changes that are going to help our citizens lead healthier lives. . . .   No American's going to remain untouched. It's going to affect how we're born, how we live, how we die. And this is far-reaching.   I think I just saw in the paper a note of a little child born in Pawtucket, Diana Rebello, Pawtucket, R.I., born on Sunday night, Aug. 7, in Women and Infants Hospital in Providence. Think of her life and what it means.   And then I think of Theresa Nigrelli of Westerly -- 100 years old, still stringing pearls every day at Nigrelli Jewelers. And she doesn't even need glasses. So we think of her, too.    And the financial aspects of this are mind-boggling. They've been touched on before, but I'd like to repeat: one-seventh of our economy in the United States of America is devoted to health care, one-fifth of the Federal budget. Of the five biggest items in the Federal budget -- Social Security, defense, interest on the debt, Medicare and Medicaid -- it's the last two that are going right off the chart, Medicare and Medicaid. Defense, banging along, going down. Social Security, fairly stable. Interest on the debt going up but not such a substantial amount. But it's the last two that are causing us our principal problem.    Now, the 1,410-page bill before us was only released a couple of days ago, and as I understand -- I'm not sure it's accurate -- I understand that changes are still being made to it. So it's up to us during this debate to air thoroughly for the American people what's in this proposed legislation and to insure that our actions don't make the situation any worse. Clearly we don't want to go backwards.                    . . .         Now we all know from study and vast experience and listening to witnesses much that's right and much that's wrong with our health care system. And we acknowledge that in many respects it's exemplary: in technology and innovation, the skill of our professionals and the range of choices.    But we also know there are several things that demand reform. And it seems to me very important to keep in mind, What are we trying to do? What's the endgame here? Goal of Security    And I think our objectives are three:   First, we must give Americans health security. We want to insure to hard-working people like Christopher North of North Smithfield, R.I., that he doesn't live in fear of losing his coverage. He, his wife and two sons were covered by his wife's policy through her employer. She lost her job. They applied for a new policy. They were turned down. Why? Because their son had a pre-existing condition. Minor though it might have been, it was enough for the insurance company to turn him down and thus their family's insurance down. . . .   But what about job lock? In other words, staying in a job you want to leave but you can't because if you go to the new place you won't be able to get insurance. Donald Bolster, Bristol, R.I., 13 years with Blue Cross. His wife suffers now from Parkinson's. No other insurance people, plan, will take them on because of a pre-existing condition. They can't shop for insurance coverage. They can't get an alternative plan. They don't have portability. They can't move to another job. That's what's known as job lock. Covering the Uninsured    The second objective: We must extend health insurance to those -- as many as we can -- who are not now covered. We want to make sure that the first group can keep their insurance; the second group we want to extend it to them. We know the statistics: 15 percent of Americans, 37 million Americans, at any one time without health insurance. In my state, it's 92,000 of our citizens -- 15,000 of them are, regrettably, children. Can't get, or don't have, health insurance.    Now who are these uninsured?    Many people have the impression that the uninsured are the poor or the elderly. That's no so. . . . The very poor have Medicaid; the elderly have Medicare.   Ironically, in our system, single-parent families are better-off in terms of health insurance than two-parent families. Single parent families are frequently on Medicaid. But two-family parents aren't. One of them's working and works for a company that doesn't provide it; the other, the wife, is at home or she's working in a firm where they don't provide the insurance likewise. Earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.   The vast majority of people without health insurance live in families in which the head of household is employed for at least some portion of the year. These aren't people who are the unemployed -- never getting a job. They're employed for at least some portion of the year.   In my state, 76 percent of the uninsured are in families in which the head of household works full time; 85 percent have incomes above the poverty level.   Now we all know it's very costly for society when individuals like these don't have health insurance. They're the ones that go into the emergency rooms of hospitals for treatments, for procedures that the hospital emergency room is not the right place. It's far too expensive for these individuals to be. Or else they don't go anywhere. And then the child or the individual, the parent, comes down with a devastating illness, that in the end costs our society far more. Controlling Costs    Now the third objective is to do something about controlling costs. Cost containment is the buzzword that's used.   The cost of health care in our society is getting tremendously expensive for the individual, for the companies, for states -- particularly through Medicaid -- and for our Federal Government.   In the United States as a whole we spend 14 percent of our gross domestic product on health care, more than any other industrial nation. The Federal Government spends 19 percent of its budget, nearly 20 percent, nearly one-fifth of all our expenditures on health care. And that's projected to go up to 25 percent by the end of the century. And local and state governments, particularly through the cost of Medicaid for state government, spend about 15 percent.   Now the country just cannot sustain these costs. You talk about what it's doing to businesses. The statistic is well known that there's a greater cost for health care involved in every automobile that's built by Chrysler and Ford, General Motors, more for health care than there is for the steel in the automobile. Twice as much we spend for health care in the United States per automobile worker per car than is spent in Japan.                    . . .         There should be a minimal level of Government intervention. Let's not replicate Medicare, which has been fine for the beneficiaries but a disaster in terms of cost containment. That's the ultimate of the micromanagement program. It's cumbersome; it's top-heavy with regulation. It produces a 12 percent annual growth in costs, which is more than double what the private sector's going up in.                    . . .         Now it seems to be we can begin to debate in earnest, taking up the bill produced by the distinguished majority leader, Senator Mitchell. He's worked hard to fuse the two bills in the Finance Committee and the Labor and Human Resources, which is a herculean effort. And I think we're indebted to Senator Mitchell for the effort he's made. Seeking a Consensus    Now there are a number of provisions in this that cause me great concern. And the Senator from Massachusetts says, Well, Dick, list them. But just don't attack the measure. Tell us specifically what you're talking about. . . .   Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I don't read the legislation right. Maybe it's changed in the subsequent rewrite. I don't know. But the President and Senator Mitchell and others have indicated they're willing to give voluntary market solutions a try before imposing Government controls. In this bill in many areas in my judgment, that voluntary market solution effort has not been given the chance it deserves.                    . . .         The Mitchell bill, but for the employer mandate, appears to reflect few of the principles that those of us in the mainstream have: those of us erring on the side of less government intervention, more marketplace competition and effective cost containment. . . .   Does it mean we can't unite?    I believe we can unite.    Does it make sense for us to try for a bipartisan measure that keeps in mind the two objectives we all say we're for?   I think if you ask people out here what are they for, they'd all say two things: We want to increase the number of Americans who have health insurance with our goal of eventually covering everyone. Everybody would agree with that, I think, very few not.    And secondly, our objective is to get costs lower for individuals for companies for state governments and for the Federal Government. Cost containment.    Nearly all of us pay tribute to the effectiveness of the marketplace. We all seem to subscribe to the notion of competition. There'd be very few people get up on the floor of this Senate and say, \"I don't believe in competition. I don't believe in the effectiveness of the marketplace.\"   We subscribe to the notion of competition, those of us in the mainstream. We're for the most part extremely skeptical of government intervention. So why can't we unite behind a bill that incorporates those beliefs? . . . 'What an Opportunity'    I and all the other members of the mainstream group want to see good health care reform enacted this year. We'll do all we can to be helpful. We believe it's extremely important to have a bill with broad support.   What am I talking about? 75 or 80 votes in favor. That's not an impossibility. Rather than a measure that sneaks through, 51 or 52.    Time is getting short, but there still remains time to produce a product that will be of great benefit to millions of Americans.    What an opportunity! What a wonderful opportunity!    So let's not let it slip through our grasp.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940811","headline":"Argentine Chief, Noting Bombing Report, May Expel Iran Envoy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/11/world/argentine-chief-noting-bombing-report-may-expel-iran-envoy.html","abstract":"  President Carlos Saul Menem said today that the Iranian Ambassador to Buenos Aires should be expelled in response to a preliminary report that implicates four former Iranian diplomats in the deadly bombing of a Jewish community center here last month.

Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/arts/for-children.html","abstract":"  Open Dance Rehearsals    Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage   Old Fulton and Hicks Streets   Brooklyn Heights   (212) 206-6674   Recommended for all ages   Through next Friday    Inside three of the Brooklyn Bridge's gigantic stone-and-brick vaults, which make up a performance space known as the Anchorage, professional dancers and children are rehearsing for a performance in September. The public is invited to watch them now. This doesn't sound like your ordinary setting for dance rehearsals, right? In fact, the vaults are clean, dark and cool but with spooky, phantom-of-the-opera overtones. In a more exalted vein, the vaults can recall the experience of being in a European cathedral.   The dance troupe, headed by Ann Carlson, a choreographer in residence at the Anchorage this summer, certainly likes it here. And if you think the vaults are strange, consider some of the sets designed by artists for the September show. Todd Gilens's \"trees\" are made up of long twigs \"planted\" in green bases; his \"gold nuggets\" of papier-mache are big enough for children to sit in them. Pat Oleszko's inflated-nylon clown sculptures are about 24 feet tall and swallow up an entire vault.   All of which is bound to perk up children on a desultory August afternoon. They can also participate in art projects during their visit: drawing their dreams, making handprints and molding plaster impressions of their arms, knees and other body parts (the casts are to be used in the September dance show).   The rehearsals are open to the public from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M today and on Aug. 17, 18 and 19, and from noon to 3 P.M. tomorrow. Ms. Carlson's performance, \"A Mirage,\" presented by Creative Time and Dance Theater Workshop, is to be held Sept. 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18.   To reach the Anchorage, take a No. 2 or No. 3 subway train to Clark Street, then walk north on Henry Street to Old Fulton Street, which you cross near Hicks Street (there is no traffic light). At the Anchorage's entrance is a large sculpture depicting a man, a woman and a child. Fulton Ferry Esplanade and Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park    26 New Dock Street (near Water Street)   Fulton Landing, Brooklyn   (718) 858-4708   Recommended for all ages    Inside the courtyard of the River Cafe is a gate to this hard-to-find esplanade, which hugs the East River and offers a view of the belly of the Brooklyn Bridge. And though the park and the esplanade can also be reached at their official address on New Dock Street, going through the grounds of River Cafe, at the end of Old Fulton Street, is easier.   On the esplanade is a display explaining how the bridge was built; the site is also popular with film makers, fashion photographers and tourists. Unfortunately, there's also a big pile of trash, so you'll want to mosey on to the adjacent state park, which doesn't look like a state park (there are no rangers, although a sign reminds you who the Governor is).   This park is a quiet, enclosed, grassy three acres with a knoll to run up and down on. Some rosehip bushes entice children to pluck their big pink berries. There are empty brick warehouses on the fringes of the park (they once were coffee and tobacco factories). In one corner of the park is a cluster of trees, and benches in the shade. On a recent afternoon, the park was buzzing with children from a nursery school; they were spritzing one another and passers-by, who didn't mind. And, oh yes, there's the river to admire.   The esplanade is open from dawn to dusk. The park's summer hours are 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. daily. Puppet-Making Workshop    Andrew Heiskell Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped   40 West 20th Street   Chelsea   (212) 206-5400   Recommended ages: 8 to 12   Tomorrow    \"I'm the puppet lady,\" said Sahyini Morningstar, who has been making puppets, doing puppet shows and teaching both skills for the last 30 years. Ms. Morningstar, who is also the founder and artistic director of the Speaking Shield Puppet Theater in Manhattan, is to create puppets tomorrow in a program meant for blind or partly sighted children.   \"I'm going to take a tactile approach,\" she said, explaining that the children are to make U-shaped finger puppets that can squeeze into a pocket. \"We'll focus on smooth and soft textures and geometric shapes and dimensions, like thickness and thinness,\" she explained. Ms. Morningstar is supplying the materials: lace, buttons, beads, seashells, Styrofoam, ribbon, yarn and glue.   The free program is at 1:30 P.M. and requires registration. A slightly different form of the program, this one for sighted children ages 6 to 12, is to be offered on Tuesday at the Hunts Point branch in the Bronx, (718) 617-0338; on Thursday at the Melrose branch in the Bronx, (718) 588-0110, and on Aug. 24 at the Harlem branch in Manhattan, (212) 348-5620. 'Jazz on the Hill'    St. Luke's Episcopal Church   Convent Avenue at 141st Street   Hamilton Heights   Manhattan   (212) 926-2713   Recommended for all ages   Sunday    Hamilton Heights wants to draw attention to its designated historical district and its artists, writers and musicians, past and present. So the recently formed Hamilton Heights Preservation Association is holding jazz concerts to make adults and children more aware of this artsy terrain.   Sunday's concert is dedicated to the saxophonist John Coltrane, who died in 1967. Coltrane didn't live in Hamilton Heights, but his music certainly influenced musicians in the community. Bernice Cummings-Ubiles of the association explained that Hamilton Heights extends from West 135th Street to West 155th Street, between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue (and then St. Nicholas Place).   Playing Sunday will be the C.C.N.Y. Jazz Trio -- a pianist, a percussionist and a bass player, all CUNY graduate students -- and vocalists and a saxophonist from Hamilton Heights. A jam session involving the audience is to finish the program.   Tickets to the show, from 6 to 8 P.M., will be available at the door. Admission is $10 and free for children under 12. Refreshments will be sold. Keep In Mind \"PLAYDAY AND KIDS' DAY,\" part of Lincoln Center Out of Doors, featuring participatory dancing, a drum workshop, mask and headdress making, the Czech puppeteer Vit Horejs, the commedia dell'arte troupe I Giullari di Piazza (Jesters of the Square), shape-note singing (a American folk tradition), storytelling, theater art, the Hudson Vagabond Puppets, the storyteller Malika Lee Whitney, clowns from the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit and World Patrol Kids, child singers and actors.

And in recent years, klezmer has gained increasing recognition in America as an essential folk tradition that distills and keeps alive the rich Yiddish culture that the Nazi death camps attempted to eradicate.    Probably no one living has done more to perpetuate klezmer traditions than Leopold Kozlowski, the subject of Yale Strom's absorbing documentary film \"The Last Klezmer,\" which opens today at the Walter Reade Theater. A Holocaust survivor who is now in his early 70's, Mr. Kozlowski, whose original name was Leopold Kleinman, is the nephew of a noted klezmer clarinetist, Naftule Brandwein, who immigrated to the United States in the 1920's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940812","headline":"From the Bench to White House Counsel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/opinion/from-the-bench-to-white-house-counsel.html","abstract":"  President Clinton has hired a lawyer of high caliber in Abner Mikva, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.

Yet there is a degree to which this grandly scaled expression of warning, exhortation and hope may remain a work in progress. Mr. Moore plans to perform it around the world over the next five years, and to usher in the year 2000 with a performance at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Given the penchant most composers have for tinkering with their scores after hearing them, it would be surprising if he did not iron out some of this work's rough spots along the way.   This is a piece with big ambitions. In it, Mr. Moore argues for peace, equality, inclusiveness, devotion to a universal Creator and the preservation of the earth and its ecology. There is an inevitable naivete in this message, but in the second of the Mass's three sections, Mr. Moore tempers its platitudinous side with reminders -- expressed in pantomime, dance and allegory -- that mankind has not done well on these points, particularly in recent times.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940812","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/sports/transactions-936529.html","abstract":"  Baseball American League  BOSTON RED SOX -- Signed Brian Rose, pitcher, and assigned him to Fort Myers of the Florida State League.

Since the war ended in 1992, U.S. attention has flagged; but the peace is fragile. While the guerrilla opposition, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or F.M.L.N., laid down its arms and participated in elections earlier this year, there is continuing evidence that right-wing death squads have not been so happy to give up their old methods.

Under existing rules, members compare proposed spending for the next year with current spending adjusted for inflation. Representative Charles Stenholm of Texas objects to that system because it counts as a budget cut a proposal that would raise spending by an amount less than inflation. He wants budget tables to compare proposed spending only against current spending without an inflation adjustment.   But if prices are rising, spending the same amount on nutrition or research would mean that fewer families get food and fewer scientists get grants. Government spending would be cut by the only definition that matters -- whether recipients receive more or fewer benefits. Without proper adjustments for inflation, members would be voting on programs with little sense of the impact of their decision.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940812","headline":"About Real EstateA Co-op Adjusts to the Cost of Freedom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/nyregion/about-real-estatea-coop-adjusts-to-the-cost-of-freedom.html","abstract":"Earlier this year, the 982-unit Morningside Gardens cooperative in upper Manhattan went private, ending 42 years of regulation by New York City.\n\nIts apartments, which were built in 1952 under the state's Redevelopment Companies Law, formerly could not exceed price limits of $10,894 for a studio and $28,804 for three bedrooms with a terrace.

Its reputation draws Chinese customers from all over New York City, many of whom know the restaurant by its more poetic Chinese characters, which translate as \"Deer's Roar Brings Spring.\" Almost all of the crowd that throngs Joe's Shanghai is Chinese, and English is a distant second language.

In Michael Greif's wildly disjointed interpretation that runs here through Sunday, the forging of human connections becomes futile to a degree that even Chekhov could never have imagined.   Watching the illustrious cast members Mr. Greif has assembled going through their extremely varied paces at the Williamstown Theater Festival is a bit like looking at one of those cinematic spoofs, like Carl Reiner's \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,\" in which bits from different movies have been spliced together to create the illusion of continuity.

This exhibition, which has been organized by the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, reviews a quarter-century's worth of Ms. Snyder's sometimes beautiful, but often grating work, starting with the lustrous idiosyncratic stain paintings with which she made her name in the late 1960's.    Ms. Snyder's paintings are at home at many points on the map of recent art. They might be described as feminist, post-Minimalist, last-gasp Color Field or proto-Neo-Expressionist, which is to say that they raise many issues, past and present, and often in a wonderfully forthright manner. Historically, she is one of several painters, including Mary Heilmann, Jennifer Bartlett and Harriet Korman, who in the late 1960's and early 70's tried to bring painting closer to the strategies of Process Art, by laying bare the bones of mark-making in a number of seductively simple works on unprimed canvas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940812","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Regis Bulot, president of the Relais & Châteaux hotel association, has just finished \"La Tentation de Venise\" by Alain Juppé..\"Written before Juppé became France's foreign minister, this is a fascinating insight into th","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940812","headline":"Son of 'Saturday Night Live' and 'Kids in the Hall'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/arts/tv-weekend-son-of-saturday-night-live-and-kids-in-the-hall.html","abstract":"  \"The Vacant Lot,\" which has its debut tonight on the cable channel Comedy Central, is the latest series to exploit the sketch-comedy genre that was defined and popularized if not originated by \"Saturday Night Live\" and perpetuated most recently by \"The Kids in the Hall.\" Like \"Kids,\" the show is named for the comedy troupe that creates and performs the material, and like both its predecessors, \"Vacant Lot\" expresses a youthful irreverence and a sense of glee in its assault on conventional good taste.

Matienzo, a 25-year-old starting center from Havana, reportedly left the team's hotel in Toronto, about an hour's drive from here, and telephoned Toronto newspapers from a convenience store. Canadian Press reported that employees of The Toronto Star had picked Matienzo up and taken him to the newspaper's office.   After Cuba lost its game to Germany tonight, 86-74, its coach, Miguel Calderon Gomez, said he had last seen Matienzo on Wednesday night when the team gathered at the hotel to watch a video of Germany's game against Brazil.   \"That was about 8:30,\" Calderon Gomez said.   The grim-faced coach would not confirm or deny the player had defected.   \"We have no information,\" he said. \"He left the hotel Wednesday night with some friends and he hasn't come back.\"   Pressed for a reaction, Calderon Gomez said, \"Our team, like with the revolution, approached the game with conviction and strength regardless of what happened.\"   None of the Cuban players would comment on the absence of Matienzo, who had been averaging 19 points a game.   Matienzo had been with the Cuban national team since 1990, and played against the Dream Team in the Tournament of the Americas in Portland in 1992. Before that game, the first for the Dream Team on its way to the gold medal at the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, the Cubans asked to pose for pictures with the N.B.A. legends. He played for Havana in the Cuban League.   Another top Cuban player, Andres Guibert, defected at the Americas qualifying tournament last November 30 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Calderon Gomez confirmed that Guibert had left the team during that tournament, but, as with Matienzo, said he had received no information and could not classify it as a defection.   Cuba has been plagued by numerous defections at recent international sporting events, as economic conditions have worsened. Approximately 50 athletes defected last year at Central American and Carribean Games and another half-dozen at the World University Games last summer in Buffalo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940812","headline":"L.I.R.R.

responds differently to every conductor who stands before it. The orchestra has had some interesting and individualistic guests this summer, and the latest of them, the Dutch conductor Hans Vonk, had them sounding particularly well disciplined on Tuesday evening.     Using a compact string complement, he led a performance of Mozart's Symphony No. 33 in B flat (K. 319) that reconciled the seemingly opposing impulses that propel so many of Mozart's best works. One is the urge toward courtly propriety, which Mr. Vonk served by giving virtually every phrase a delicately nuanced shape. The other is a need to break free of formal strictures (or at least, some of them) and to find outlets not only in Mozart's typically high-spirited finales, but also more subversively, in the adventures he undertakes in working out his themes.

In some ways, it is even more relevant to the United States today than it was when it created a sensation on its original publication in 1944.\n\nNearly a quarter of a century ago, I wrote an introduction to a new German edition of \"The Road to Serfdom.\" That introduction is equally relevant to this 50th anniversary edition. I herewith quote it in full before adding a few comments.\n\n\nOver the years, I have made it a practice to inquire of believers in individualism how they came to depart from the collectivist orthodoxy of our times. For years, the most frequent answer was a reference to \n[\nthis\n]\n book. Hayek's remarkable and vigorous tract was a revelation particularly to the young men and women who had been in the armed forces during the war. Their recent experience had enhanced their appreciation of the value and meaning of individual freedom. In addition, they had observed a collectivist organization in action. For them, Hayek's predictions about the consequences of collectivism were not simply hypothetical possibilities.\n\nToday, we hear little of \"central planning,\" of \"production for use,\" of the need for \"conscious direction\" of society's resources. Instead the talk is of the urban crisis -- solvable, it is said, only by vastly expanded government programs; of the environmental crises -- produced, it is said, by rapacious businessmen who must be forced to discharge their social responsibility instead of \"simply\" operating their enterprises to make the most profit and requiring also, it is said, vastly expanded government programs; of the consumer crisis -- false values stimulated by the self-same rapacious businessmen seeking profits instead of exercising social responsibility and of course also requiring expanded government programs to protect the consumer, not least from himself; of the welfare or poverty crisis -- here the jargon is still \"poverty in the midst of plenty,\" though what is now described as poverty would have been regarded as plenty when that slogan was first widely used.\n\nNow as then, the promotion of collectivism is combined with the profession of individualist values. Experience with big government has strengthened this discordant strand. There is wide protest against the \"establishment\"; an incredible conformity in the protest against conformity; a widespread demand for freedom to \"do one's own thing,\" for individual life styles, for participatory democracy.\n\nAs Hayek so persuasively demonstrates, these values require an individualistic society. They can be achieved only in a liberal order in which government activity is limited primarily to establishing the framework with which individuals are free to pursue their own objectives. The free market is the only mechanism that has ever been discovered for achieving participatory democracy.\n\nUnfortunately, the relation between the ends and the means remains widely misunderstood. Many of those who profess the most individualistic objectives support collectivist means without recognizing the contradiction. \n\nIt is tempting to believe that social evils arise from the activities of evil men and that if only good men (like ourselves, naturally) wielded power, all would be well. That view requires only emotion and self-praise -- easy to come by and satisfying as well. To understand why it is that \"good\" men in positions of power will produce evil, while the ordinary man without power but able to engage in voluntary cooperation with his neighbors will produce good, requires analysis and thought, subordinating the emotions to the rational faculty.\n\nSurely that is one answer to the perennial mystery of why collectivism, with its record of producing tyranny and misery, is so widely regarded as superior to individualism, with its demonstrated record of producing freedom and plenty. The argument for collectivism is simple if false; it is an immediate emotional argument. The argument for individualism is subtle and sophisticated; it is an indirect rational argument.\n\nHow stands the battle between collectivism and individualism in the West after the publication of Hayek's great tract? The answer is very different in the world of affairs and in the world of ideas.\n\nIn the world of affairs, those of us who were persuaded by Hayek's analysis saw few signs in 1945 of anything but a steady growth of the state at the expense of the individual, a steady replacement of private initiative and planning by state initiative and planning.\n\nYet in practice that movement did not go much farther. What produced this unexpected check to collectivism? First, particularly in Britain, the conflict between central planning and individual liberty that is Hayek's theme became patent. The tradition of liberty, the liberal values, were still sufficiently strong in Britain so that when the conflict occurred, central planning was sacrificed rather than individual liberty.\n\nThe second force checking collectivism was its inefficiency. Government proved unable to manage enterprises, to organize resources to achieve stated objectives at reasonable cost. It became mired in bureaucratic confusion and inefficiency. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the check to collectivism did not check the growth of government; rather, it diverted its growth to a different channel. The emphasis shifted from governmentally administrated production activities to indirect regulation of supposedly private enterprises and even more to governmental transfer programs, involving extracting taxes from some in order to make grants to others -- all in the name of equality and the eradication of poverty but in practice producing an erratic and contradictory melange of subsidies to special-interest groups. As a result, the fraction of the national income being spent by governments has continued to mount.\n\nIn the world of ideas, the outcome has been even less satisfactory to a believer in individualism. In one respect, this is most surprising. Experience in the past quarter-century has strongly confirmed the validity of Hayek's central insight -- that coordination of men's activities through central direction and through voluntary cooperation are roads going in very different directions: the first to serfdom, the second to freedom.\n\n\nIn 1994, there is wide agreement that socialism is a failure, capitalism a success. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism behind the Iron Curtain and the changing character of China have reduced the defenders of a Marxian-type collectivism to a small, hardy band concentrated in Western universities. Yet this apparent conversion of the intellectual community to what might be called a Hayekian view is deceptive.\n\nWhile the talk is about free markets and private property -- and it is more respectable than it was a few decades ago to defend near-complete laissez-faire -- the bulk of the intellectual community almost automatically favors any expansion of government power so long as it is advertised as a way to protect individuals from big bad corporations, relieve poverty, protect the environment or promote \"equality.\" The discussion of a national program of health care provides a striking example. The intellectuals may have learned the words but they do not yet have the tune.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940813","headline":"Delay Is Reported in Closing Pipe After Edison Explosion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/13/nyregion/delay-is-reported-in-closing-pipe-after-edison-explosion.html","abstract":"  Natural gas feeding the enormous fireball that erupted from a broken pipeline in Edison, N.J., in March flowed unimpeded for up to two and a half hours while workers struggled to shut off valves on the line, according to documents released here today.

Montana Helps Ruin Two D. C. Debuts  Solid efforts by Kansas City's Joe Montana and Steve Bono overshadowed the home debuts of the new Redskins coach, Norv Turner, and the new Washington quarterback, Heath Shuler, as the Chiefs rallied for a 17-14 exhibition victory last night at R.F.K. Stadium. Montana, making his first start of the preseason, played the first half, leading the Chiefs on two scoring drives while completing 11 of 20 passes for 118 yards. The Washington offense sputtered under the rookie Shuler, who replaced John Friesz and played the second half after practicing just five days in training camp since ending a contract holdout. Shuler was 9 of 21 for 61 yards. (AP)   49ers Get It Right: A week after opening with a dud, the San Francisco 49ers looked more like themselves in a 20-3 victory over the visiting Denver Broncos. Steve Young completed 7 of 10 passes for 74 yards in a quarter of play, including his first scoring pass of the preseason. The Broncos' John Elway was held to 3 completions in 9 attempts for 23 yards, and Richard Dent and Ken Norton, two of San Francisco's defensive acquisitions, both turned in strong efforts. An interested spectator was the free-agent cornerback Deion Sanders, who didn't have to be with the Cincinnati Reds because of the baseball strike. He watched the game in a stadium suite with 49ers President Carmen Policy. (AP)   George and Falcons Get Best of Bills: Atlanta's Jeff George passed for two touchdowns and Bobby Hebert, in his first appearance since underdoing elbow surgery in February, engineered two field-goal drives as the Falcons beat the visiting Buffalo Bills, 27-7, last night. The Bills, who opened exhibition play Monday with a 13-11 victory over Washington, played without a trio of key offensive performers who helped Buffalo reach the last four Super Bowls -- quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas and wide receiver Andre Reed. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD Gunnell Dominates Field in 400 Hurdles  Sally Gunnell outclassed her two runners-up by more than 8 meters to win the women's 400-meter hurdles final at the European Championships in Helsinki, Finland, yesterday, and add the only big title missing from her remarkable collection. Gunnell, from Great Britain, now has Olympic, world, Commonwealth and European titles. She also holds the world record of 52.74, set in last year's world championship final at Stuttgart, Germany. Gunnell, 29, clocked a world seasonal best of 53.33 seconds despite being unchallenged on the homestretch. Silvia Rieger of Germany and Anna Knoroz of Russia finished in a tie for second, in 54.68. Colin Jackson capped a great evening for the British hurdlers, winning the 110 hurdles final in 13.08 seconds for his country's fifth gold medal some 80 minutes after Gunnell's triumph. Jackson, who set the world record of 12.91 when he captured the world championship a year ago, finished .08 ahead of Florian Schwarthoff of Germany. (AP) GOLF McGill Near Another Women's Amateur  Jill McGill moved within one victory of her second consecutive United States Women's Amateur title by rallying for a 1-up triumph over the 1994 collegiate champion Emilee Klein yesterday in Hot Springs, Va. Waiting for her in today's 36-hole championship match is Wendy Ward, 21, of San Antonio, who shot a six-under-par 30 on the front nine on the way to a 7-and-5 rout of Andrea Baxter at the Homestead resort's Cascades Course. It was the most lopsided victory in the Women's Amateur semifinals since 1977, when Cathy Sherk of Canada was a 9-and-8 winner over Brenda Goldsmith of San Antonio. (AP) The Round of Her Life: Janice Gibson, never a winner or even a leader in her nine-year pro career spanning 146 tournaments, shot a six-under-par 66 for her lowest round ever and took a one-stroke lead after the first round of the inaugural Children's Medical Center L.P.G.A. Classic in Beavercreek, Ohio. Gibson, who played only one tournament last year because of a herniated disk in her neck, missed the cut in her previous three tournaments. (AP)   Scorched Course Policy: Before the opening round of the Senior PGA First of America Classic in Ada, Mich., the tour's leading money winner, Lee Trevino, predicted a score of six under par could win the $650,000 tournament. Perhaps Trevino should revise that prediction because four players -- Isao Aoki, Jim Albus, Graham Marsh and Jimmy Powell -- fired six-under 66's to lead by only one stroke over the threesome of Larry Mowry, Tom Wargo and Dave Stockton.

However the case ultimately turns out, the indictment marks a bold and welcome use of Federal civil rights law against racial killings on city streets.    Mr. Rosenbaum, a rabbinical student from Australia, was caught up in riots that followed an automobile accident in which a 7-year-old black child was killed. The car was part of the entourage of the Lubavitcher rabbi. Angry blacks, shouting \"Kill the Jew,\" chased Mr. Rosenbaum and someone stabbed him.
