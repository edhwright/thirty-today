Tomoko Liguori Gallery  93 Grand Street  SoHo  Through July 24    An ominous tone runs through much of the work in this group show, which focuses on the relationship between personal identity and the body.  In Bill Jacobson's out-of-focus black-and-white images, a man's head becomes featureless and generic; in Joe Ziolkowski's studio pictures, crisply lighted and sharply focused, nude males balance precariously on a tightrope or hang upside down.   The fleshly theme is continued in Cindy Sherman's dress-up picture of herself as pregnant (with a plastic belly) and wearing white eye shadow and wild hair; one of John Coplans's nude self-portraits, as a heroic if hairy figure, is included as well. The dissolution of the body is suggested by Ilyse Soutine's flatfooted color photograph of what looks like a homemade electric chair, and by Jeff Wall's coolly dispassionate aerial view of a cemetery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Croatia and Bosnia : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/opinion/IHT-croatia-and-bosnia-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The international community has a growing tendency to cover up its indecision over Bosnia-Herzegovina by putting the blame not just on the Serbs but on the Croatian side, too. .On the one hand, the international community presses the Croats to negotiat","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Indurain Is Fast; Rominger Is First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/sports/cycling-indurain-is-fast-rominger-is-first.html","abstract":"  Luck, or whatever it was that he did not have earlier in the Tour de France, has begun to turn Tony Rominger's way, and today the Swiss rider won his second successive Alpine stage.

They must honestly and openly examine all causes of priestly abuse and the historical pattern of institutional cover-up.

Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's plan to defend the Everglades from the further ravages of commerce gives the expiring patient its first ray of hope in years. But it is only a ray. A lot more hard bargaining lies ahead before anyone can declare victory.    The plan results from a month of furious negotiations among state and Federal officials and leaders of Florida's powerful agricultural interests, mainly the sugar growers. It seeks to give the vast \"river of grass\" what it needs most: a timely, reliable supply of fresh water.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Serendipity And Schlock Out on the Road","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/arts/serendipity-and-schlock-out-on-the-road.html","abstract":"  I AM a sucker for roadside attractions.

As teacher and collaborator, I try to help the children make photographs that are both new and yet revealing of their culture's visual history. I showed the Indian children in Mexico ancient Mayan pictograms to teach the idea of sequencing photographs and words. In India, at first, the children wanted to photograph their gods and goddesses; they thought that they simply could imagine an image and the camera would produce it.

The Mayor must be a satisfied man, because giant cranes now dominate the historic skyline and most of the city's great buildings are covered in whole or in part by scaffolding.   Although Dresden's architectural jewels are temporarily shrouded, its rich collections of painting, sculpture, porcelain and other treasures are on full display. Tourism and business are booming, overwhelming the modest capacity of local hotels. The job of rebuilding the old Saxon capital, which was devastated by an Allied bombing attack in 1945 and largely neglected during 40 years of Communist rule, is expected to take more than a decade. Restoration of old or damaged structures as well as new building projects are part of the program.

Dance fuses past and present for peoples as diverse as the Aymara in Bolivia, where youngsters still perform the Qhashwa on frosty nights to protect the potato crop, and the Kiowa in Oklahoma, where veterans of Operation Desert Storm perform dances at meetings of the Black Legs Society. Unfortunately, the accompanying essays, written by scholars and curators, fail to match the impact of the photographs and presume a working knowledge of American Indian cosmology and history. The authors tend to dwell on esoteric matters, like variations in costume. The best essays, like that on Northern Plains dances by Lynn Huenemann, an Indian education official in Iowa, make a point of quoting performers, who tell how dancing can heal sickness and protect crops; their words make the magical seem part of everyday life.

Conversation is possible and is always polite: there is no way to raise the voice in sending a typed message. Since the players all have bridge and computers as common interests, friendships develop readily. One East Coast-West Coast bridge partnership became a regular fixture, and after some exchanges of personal information and a face-to-face meeting, it seems headed for matrimony.   There seems to be an unlimited future for computer bridge. At the bottom end of the scale, lessons are already available. At the top end we can expect to see a world championship in which players will compete simultaneously while remaining in their own cities or countries. One advantage is that in each country the action can be broadcast on closed-circuit television and on Vugraph. The World Bridge Federation is considering plans for such an event.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Craig Wasserman and Marla Weinstein","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/engagements-craig-wasserman-and-marla-weinstein.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Stan Weinstein of Hollywood, Fla., have announced the engagement of their daughter Marla J.

Many of the elegant small Gothic and Renaissance palaces that rim the main square have been repainted in the last two years. Jazz spots in stone cellars are being scrubbed down; new sidewalk cafes with spiffy furniture and umbrellas are opening almost weekly, it seems. Bookshops, art and antiques galleries show the contemporary and the old. The food, if you choose carefully, is perking up.    This reawakening is taking place against the backdrop of Cracow's immutable strengths: an old town of narrow cobbled streets and 60 churches, the Jagiellonian University, which counts Copernicus and Pope John Paul II among its alumni, and the 13th-century Wawel royal castle, a moody, dark bulk of fortressed walls, onion domes and spires atop a limestone hill. Complementing Cracow's architecture is its music. The variety of excellent music being performed makes Cracow more than just another museum town. During a few days' stay, a Baroque chamber concert in a palace salon, a jazz group in a subterranean club or opera at the 1897 Juliusz Slowacki theater, a glittering miniature version of the Paris Opera, is almost assured.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Making Color Last: An Expert Speaks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/camera-making-color-last-an-expert-speaks.html","abstract":"  NOT many photographers walk into a photo shop and ask, \"Will the film you're selling me and the prints you make last a hundred years?\"    But Henry Wilhelm has spent most of his life in the world of photography testing how long photographic films and prints -- both black-and-white and color -- can last, and what can be done to make them last longer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"They Were Smart, All Right, But Then This Is a TV Movie","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/television-view-they-were-smart-all-right-but-then-this-is-a-tv-movie.html","abstract":"  If a 40-year-old woman meets her former best friend, a younger woman now married to the older woman's ex-husband, what does the first wife say to the second wife?   a) \"You lookin' at me?\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Nutritional Curiosity In Medicine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/nyregion/l-nutritional-curiosity-in-medicine-972593.html","abstract":"  Your interview with Dr. David Walters (June 27) points out a disappointing lack of nutritional curiosity in medicine.

From the minute you pick it up, it seems to eat money, starting with surcharges for calls to \"free\" 800 numbers all the way down to charges for calls you try to make but go unanswered. In many cases, letting a child into the minibar would be cheaper.   The worst situation appears to be dialing a long-distance call, with the toll to be charged to your room bill. Even when you dial every digit yourself, it will probably be billed at the higher operator-assisted rate, and there will be a surcharge beyond that, which may be as high as 50 percent of the cost of the call. Sometimes the surcharge is by the call, sometimes by the minute, sometimes a combination. Using a credit card linked to your regular phone company, either to charge the call or to call collect, will get you around this.

The new cast album, entitled \"The Who's 'Tommy' \" (RCA, 09026-61874-2; 2 CD's and cassettes), documents the ways the director Des McAnuff's stage version has shrewdly reinterpreted Pete Townshend's creation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"FOCUS;\nLife After City Subsidies in Cincinnati","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/realestate/focus-life-after-city-subsidies-in-cincinnati.html","abstract":"In a dilapidated three-story town house vacant since the 50's, a local developer is betting $175,000 in borrowed money that a neighborhood in the process of renewal will continue to attract people to city life.\n\nThe developer, Paul Cmil, is hoping to restore the mid-19th century brick house and rent three apartments for $500 a month in what has been a rundown section just northwest of the city's downtown.

There's no bronze. There's no bronze-tinted glass. There's no Four Seasons, with its bronzed and burnished clientele. At 860-880, the glass is clear; the structural skeletons of the two apartment towers are painted black. No sleek curtain wall smooths over their jutting bones. And unlike Seagram's rows of neatly calibrated window shades, the windows at 860-880 are dressed with heavy curtains, randomly bunched against the sun.   It may take a while, in other words, to register that Miesian refinement did not depend on sumptuous materials or polished perfection. It required clarity of purpose, 3,000 years of geometry, and a good eye. No. 860-880 has the rawness of invention. This is Mies fresh out of the box or, more accurately, fresh into it. Built in 1949-51, these two Chicago towers are the first examples of the steel-and-glass high-rises that conquered the world.

But its pairing of 19th-century African \"power objects\" with the work of a contemporary African-American artist implicitly raises questions about the relationship of Western and non-Western art that the exhibition comes nowhere near answering.  The show, which runs through Jan. 2, includes more than 30 carved wooden figures called \"minkisi\" (min-KEY-see, roughly translated as \"things that do things\"). They were made a century ago by the people of Kongo (an ancient territory that covered parts of present-day Congo, Angola and Zaire). Wrapped in fabric or bristling with nails, these objects are credited with the power to change human lives. The last gallery is devoted to work by Renee Stout, a young Washington artist whose sculptures adapt many superficial features of these figures.    Superficiality is the problem. For although \"Astonishment and Power\" suggests a continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today, it reveals instead how tenuous this connection can be if crucial cultural differences are ignored.  In fact, the most satisfying way for a viewer to approach \"Astonishment and Power\" is to treat the Kongo objects, carefully mounted and documented by Wyatt MacGaffey, an anthropologist, as an exhibition in itself. Although most of the minkisi (\"nkisi\" in the singular) in the show are human figures, they can also take the form of clay pots, leaf-wrapped packets or stitched cloth pouches. Once the nkisi is implanted with symbolic medicines -- ashes, roots, seeds, crushed bone, or dirt taken from graves -- it is considered to be inhabited by a spirit whose energies can be activated, often for a fee, by the insertion of nails or metal blades into the object itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Rama Atassi, Souheil Hajjar","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/weddings-rama-atassi-souheil-hajjar.html","abstract":"  Rama Atassi, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. M.

The ones about Herbert von Karajan are singular in that almost every punch line makes the same essential point. Here's a sample: Karajan goes to the undertaker and wants to look at coffins -- something simple and economical, please. The undertaker interprets this in his own way and shows various models of fine material and elegant design, each of which is rejected. Finally the conductor insists on being shown simple wooden coffins and selects one. Undertaker, pained: \"But tell me, Herr von Karajan, why, for such an important occasion, should you economize?\" Karajan, calm: \"And why should I spend a fortune when I'm only staying three days?\"   In fact Karajan was not so trusting about resurrection; he was more like the ancient pharaohs, providing elaborately for his posthumous comfort. The central project of his last decade was to document on film, for eventual release on laser disk, the core repertory he had conducted and recorded so often during his remarkable career. (It was typical of his confidence that he conceived this series on such a grand scale before the commercial viability of the laser disk had even been tested.) An enormous first installment is now available from Sony Classical, dominating the orchestral video market by sheer quantity.

In 1848, at 34, already internationally acclaimed, he returned to his native farmland near the country town of Busseto, midway between Parma and Cremona, not only to visit but to stay. He made it his home for 53 years until his death, in 1901.   While temporarily lodging in Busseto, he acquired property in the neighboring hamlet of Sant'Agata -- \"a hut in such poor condition,\" he wrote, \"so humble . . . that I am ashamed to allow even my most intimate friends to see it\" -- and set about the arduous task of rendering it habitable and establishing a farm. The Villa Verdi, with its serene Parma-yellow facade and green shutters, stands today in solitary distinction in its farmlands, just as it did 100 years ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Your Home: Condo Fees; Creative Concepts Cut Costs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/realestate/your-home-condo-fees-creative-concepts-cut-costs.html","abstract":"  T-SHIRTS, sweatshirts, golf shirts, bumper stickers, decals and even personalized letterheads, emblazoned with the association's logo, are among novelty items that the leaders of the 4,000-unit Brandermill homeowners association in Richmond, Va., hope to sell to unit owners this fall.

It is used to categorize some of the music of the erstwhile avant-garde. I doubt that the term, with its hint of grasping ambition, will catch on, but it signifies an attempt by talented younger composers to move beyond Minimalism and other styles that have dominated the scene since the 1970's.   The esthetic of Totalism is inspired by Minimalism's use of repetition and by the instrumentation and styles of rock, pop and world music, but it also aims for the larger structures and more elaborate harmonies of the classical tradition. Unlike much other recent downtown music, Totalist music is totally scored, not improvised. It aspires to sounds and textures more complex than anything associated with the downtown scene or its pop counterparts. Just as uptown locales have begun to institutionalize downtown, downtown has begun to rethink uptown.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Steamers Still Ply The Mississippi","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/travel/travel-advisory-steamers-still-ply-the-mississippi.html","abstract":"  Floodwaters on the Upper Mississippi, which have swelled the flow of the river by hundreds of thousands of cubic feet per second, have stopped neither the steamer Mississippi Queen nor the National Historic Landmark paddlewheeler the Delta Queen.

It does not have as impressive a setting as its big brother on Shelter Island. But the menu is much the same, the food is as good, and the prices are noticeably lower. Furthermore, Aldo's at 103 Front Street (477-1699), has been there longer than its Dering Harbor counterpart. Its antique furniture, pressed-tin ceiling, slate floors, wicker baskets and old-fashioned hanging-light globes also give it more character and more authenticity.    Dining at Aldo's in Dering Harbor means nautical vistas, trees and sunsets. At the countrified French bistro in Greenport no-nonsense regulars sit down to eat at old wood tables, much as they would in their grandmothers' kitchens.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Partial Step On Gay Ban","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/us/partial-step-on-gay-ban.html","abstract":"  Though it falls well short of his unqualified campaign pledge to lift the ban entirely, President Clinton's plan to allow homosexuals in the military gives gay men and women in uniform more protection than they now have and serves as a stepping stone toward broader relaxation of restrictions.   The proposal to allow homosexuals to serve as long as they do not aggressively declare their sexual orientation or engage in homosexual conduct angered and disappointed gay rights groups. But many of those homosexuals in the armed services, who tend to be more conservative than civilian advocates for gay rights, believe the compromise is a move in the right direction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Engineers of Death","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/opinion/engineers-of-death.html","abstract":"On March 4, 1946, agents of the Red Army's military intelligence branch in the occupied German city of Erfurt arrested four senior engineers of Topf and Sohne. The firm's name had been found on nameplates identifying it as the maker of cremation furnaces at concentration camps in Buchenwald, Dachau, Mauthausen, Gross-Rosen and Auschwitz-Birkenau. Ludwig Topf, the managing director, had committed suicide in May 1945. His brother, Ernst-Wolfgang, had fled the Soviet-occupied zone.\n\nYet, Gustav Braun, Topf's technical director, and senior engineers Kurt Prufer, Karl Schultze and Fritz Sander may well have thought themselves safe. Mr. Prufer had been interrogated and released by officers of the American Third Army, the first Allied troops to enter Erfurt. He had evidently persuaded the Americans that the crematoriums he had helped design and build were in concentration camps for health reasons only. The firm, after all, had started building cremation furnaces for civilian use in 1912, and Mr. Prufer had been designing them since 1923.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Deborah Brightman, Egidio Farone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/weddings-deborah-brightman-egidio-farone.html","abstract":"  Deborah Elizabeth Brightman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry S.
