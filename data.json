Maybe a little too perfectly. Anyone coming to this show expecting to find the emotional gravity of the 17th-century Baroque golden age will be disappointed. The silver age that followed, at least as represented in these watercolors, asked something different of its artists: polish rather than depth, and a secular, rational light in place of the spiritual dramas of chiaroscuro. Drama itself, in fact, seems to have gone out of fashion. Clouds pile up in the skies, the star-crossed lovers of classical myth appear, but there is little sign of storms or hearts breaking. The only real narratives are illustrated scenes from popular stage farces, and the emblems of transience that ran like a subtle bass note throughout Dutch painting of an earlier day find little place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Mexico Takes Giant Steps Toward a New Era","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/opinion/l-mexico-takes-giant-steps-toward-a-new-era-214393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Whatever one's view of the North American Free Trade Agreement, your pages have largely overlooked Mexico's moves toward fundamental political change since the country's 1988 electoral trauma.

On Sunday at 8 P.M. and Monday at 9 and 11, most of the same musicians will participate in \"Hu Die,\" \"Que Tran\" and \"Hwang Chin-ee,\" Mr. Zorn's musings on Orientalia: recitations in Asian languages that interweave with improvisations by a few musicians at a time.

Nigel Hawthorne, who plays the monarch who lost America in \"The Madness of George III,\" makes it easy. His astonishing performance, a cascading flow of endearing bluster, hot rage and scalding tears, begins where his dry comedic turn in television's \"Yes, Minister\" leaves off; it makes his Tony Award-winning portrait of C. S. Lewis in \"Shadowlands\" look like a cameo. Who could not love a ruler who merges the accessible, everyman's nobility of Ralph Richardson with the plebeian, jocular vulgarity of Mel Brooks?   The play that provides the springboard for Mr. Hawthorne's triumph is by Alan Bennett, who is arguably the best playwright in England whose major works remain unproduced in the American theater. \"The Madness of George III\" is not one of those major works, but it would be silly to complain too much about a play that gives audiences a chance to savor an unforgettable performance. And it's easy to see why \"George III,\" in its original Royal National Theater production directed by Nicholas Hytner, has been sent on American tour while tougher Bennett works like \"Single Spies\" and \"Talking Heads\" have been limited to piecemeal presentation on public television. With its 18th-century pomp and circumstance, large cast, flourishes of Handel and opulent rustle of costumes, \"George III\" is more readily marketable as the sort of Broadway entertainment the Colonies are thought to prefer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Smith (1-0), Cowboys (0-2) Come to Terms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/sports/pro-football-smith-1-0-cowboys-0-2-come-to-terms.html","abstract":"  It took a while for Jerry Jones to see the handwriting on the scoreboard, and even then he had to swallow twice.

Using his position as a platform, the outspoken investment banker created a broad and unusual role for himself as the city's fiscal conscience. Now that Mr. Rohatyn has resigned, New Yorkers can only hope that circumstances and luck will conspire to bring them another Rohatyn, a shrewd private citizen with enough patience and guile to prod and guide political insiders.   Mr. Rohatyn came on the scene with the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, when Gov. Hugh Carey enlisted him to help save New York City from bankruptcy. That accomplished, Mr. Rohatyn turned himself into New York's pessimistic truth-teller. He could overdo it -- hence his familiar \"Cassandra\" label. He could anger other players in the city's fiscal drama -- especially labor leaders who resented his hard-edged advice. He could act like a rival to the mayor, bent on making policy for the city. He could fuss over his press coverage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"4 on Metro-North Train Robbed by Armed Gang","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/nyregion/4-on-metro-north-train-robbed-by-armed-gang.html","abstract":"  Five masked men staged an armed robbery on a Metro-North commuter train last night, robbing four passengers and escaping, a Metro-North spokesman said early this morning.

His voice is a baritone with a trapdoor into the bass range; he can invoke the nasal tension of country singing and the full-throated release of soul shouting. Onstage, he mugs through his songs, rubber-faced and intent on every detail, putting thumb and forefinger together in a line about smoke rings, holding up both arms to gesture like a preacher, rolling his eyes and jerking his chin in happy reaction to one of Michael Ward's squealing guitar solos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930918","headline":"Sarajevo Meeting on Peace Pact Is Set; U.S. May Ease Sanctions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/18/world/sarajevo-meeting-on-peace-pact-is-set-us-may-ease-sanctions.html","abstract":"  Secretary of State Warren Christopher has sent a message to the Belgrade Government hinting at the possibility of easing economic and political sanctions against Serbia in the event of a Bosnian peace settlement.

From the late 1960's to the mid-1970's, Canterbury spawned a handful of overlapping bands that quietly invented a local version of progressive rock. Richard Sinclair, who played bass and sang for four leading Canterbury bands -- Wildeflowers, Caravan, Camel, and Hatfield and the North -- showed that the style survives when he slipped into New York on Wednesday night for a solo show at Fez, at Lafayette and Great Jones Streets. The early set was broadcast live by WFMU.    The Canterbury style was genial and free-flowing, tinged with folksy melody and jazz harmonies and always underplaying its musical gamesmanship; it channeled free-form psychedelic jamming into elastic song structures. The music ambled along with asymmetrical tunes that interrupted themselves or sped up to cram more words in or wandered off on tangents. The lyrics, too, meandered from declarations of love to everyday worries to philosophical shrugs: \"The only thing to do is grin and bear it.\" Mr. Sinclair's voice, a sleepy, breathy croon, was the

They don't lord it over anybody. They don't have a hidden agenda. They just sit there, posing interesting questions. Like the tomatilloes I'm growing this year. I'd come across them last year at the Garden of Happiness, a community garden on Prospect Avenue in the Bronx, a project sponsored by the New York Botanical Garden's Bronx Greenup program.   A man named Juan Guerrero had reached into a bush that grew over his head and handed me what looked like a sticky green golf ball in a husk.

In this companion volume to the collection's first venture out of its Merion, Pa., gallery, works by Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne and Picasso make their first print appearance in gorgeous color and endow each page with revelations of exquisite nuance, astonishing detail, innovative technique and sheer intelligence. French and American scholars have contributed extensive and accessible notes about the artists' careers, the paintings' origins and their place within the Barnes collection. Paradoxically, the forewords and introductory essays to this brilliant array reveal that its esthetic bias somewhat belies the vision Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951) -- chemist, businessman, philanthropist, educator and adventurous collector -- strove to establish and communicate through his collection as a whole. Barnes was obsessed by the continuity of great art throughout the ages, and he delighted in conveying what he had discovered -- that, for example, Modigliani's figures echoed the elongated lines of African tribal masks. Thus his gallery showed ancient Chinese paintings, ceramics and old European masters next to the then-risque French paintings reproduced in this book, and next to the American Indian and African-American art, African sculptures and Mexican retablos he was among the first to collect. This illuminating context is sorely missed.

Rather, Mr. Nunn has pushed through a bill designed to make certain that homosexuals are kept out of the military -- and that any further changes in policy head toward exclusion rather than inclusion.   This benighted retreat from principle is driven by prejudice and politics. That became inescapably clear with the release of a previously suppressed study by the Rand Corporation, the Pentagon's favorite think tank.

Styles of The Times asked three of the Lampoon's present staff members to comment on Mr. O'Brien's first week.: Dear Conan,   Though flattered by the opportunity to offer you some constructive criticism, we feel it's a bit like the snotty little reprobate back-talking a well-respected teacher. (You have long been admired at our little magazine.) Anyway, everyone knows we would be fools to make any negative comments about a man to whom we will all soon be groveling for jobs.    That said, we are snotty little reprobates, and we're still shielded enough from the real world to be able to give anyone back talk, particularly you. So here then is our thoroughly unbiased and utterly honest impression of your first week.   * Our generation isn't as cool as yours. But we think the show's on too late. Put it on earlier.   * Shave Max Weinberg's head. Bald band leaders are funny.   * When it's nice outside, maybe you could have the show outside just once.   * The talking Clinton and Schwarzenegger heads with the animated mouths are hilarious. Of course, Clutch Cargo's perfected it, but we won't say anything if you don't.   * When you tell a joke, say some of the words with italics. Works for us!   * The leg wrestling was funny and all, but we do not appreciate you displaying secret Lampoon rituals.   * You asked a trivia question about the Partridge family and the answer provided was \"we don't know.\" A disregard for learning is never funny.   * We laughed ourselves silly at your casting of Andy Richter as your sidekick. He does look exactly like that mean old Dean Phruple! Wink! Wink! Attaboy, Conan!   * And what's with this name change, \"Conan\"? We like you just fine with your given name, and you will always be Cy Kugenspiel in our hearts.   In summary, we think you're doing a great job. We're all really proud of you, and you're doing the Lampoon proud. But we know that any of us kids could do your job at least as well -- and we sleep better knowing this.

Like many others, I knew my new neighborhood only through brief dips into its unparalleled smorgasbord of ethnic restaurants. I'd previously dismissed this corridor to the ocean along the north flank of Golden Gate Park as somehow less than truly San Franciscan. After all, this is a precinct with no hills, no hippies, no painted ladies, as San Francisco's Victorian houses are called. A year later, I'd argue that no other section so accurately reflects the city where the United Nations was founded. In the place known to generations of Asian immigrants as Old Gold Mountain, the Richmond may be the most golden, the most Californian place of all. Certainly, it is the area that most persistently reminds us that our little Barbary Coast is but part of one interconnected metalopolis known as the Pacific Rim.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"In the Region/Westchester; Trading Development Rights for Goodwill","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-trading-development-rights-for-goodwill.html","abstract":"  ARRANGEMENTS in which developers relinquish some development rights on a piece of property in exchange for the goodwill of a community that might otherwise be hostile to the project are becoming more common, especially in conservation-minded communities like Bedford.

Entertaining -- singing -- is similar in that you try to relate to people, to touch them in some way.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"A Careful Game Plan Goes Awry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/sports/college-basketball-a-careful-game-plan-goes-awry.html","abstract":"  For many of the 13 years that he lived here and for the 10 that he hasn't, Jerrod Mustaf has always looked forward to the annual fall gatherings that bring 200 aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and cousins to the family farm in Rosehill, a small rural community near here.

So it's small surprise that visitors pour in once the days cool down. Where to stay? With over 64,000 hotel rooms in Manhattan alone, the choices are dazzling, or dizzying, depending on your sentiments, with something at nearly any price. (Taxes are the problem: expect to pay 14 1/4 percent plus $2 a room for rooms under $100 and 19 1/4 percent for rooms over $100, plus $2 a room.) As ever, the old faithfuls are eager for your business. But there's a new crop of hotels every season or so, from renovated oldies to start-from-scratch newcomers. I recently spent the night at four hotels, all built or renovated in the last two years. They ranged from a $95-a-night budget model to a $295-and-up luxury hotel. And, not surprisingly, they were as different and distinctive as New Yorkers themselves. The Four Seasons   It's easy to develop a Master of the Universe complex at the new Four Seasons Hotel, which rises 52 stories above East 57th Street. Morning arrived, and from the king-size bed I pushed the electronic button to open the peach silk curtains. Magically, Manhattan appeared, looking splendid -- the pink Sony building, the Park Avenue Building pyramid and the Chrysler Building's silvery spear, backed by a cloudless blue sky. \"This is why people come to New York,\" said my husband, gazing at the 24th-floor view.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"Jennifer Alderson, Nathaniel Benson","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/style/weddings-jennifer-alderson-nathaniel-benson.html","abstract":"  Jennifer Alderson, an assistant marketing manager at Estee Lauder International, was married yesterday to Nathaniel Lawrence Benson, a vice president and the general manager of Clinique International.

The shop, on the main concourse, resembles a stainless-steel subway car, with display cases in place of the windows. The store sells miniature trains, old-style subway tokens and items designed around tokens, like key chains. The Transit Museum shop is to share its space in the terminal with a branch of the New York City Transit Authority Travel Information Center. Times Square Getting More Than Takeout    Times Square should soon be booming with big, new out-of-town restaurants. The Olive Garden, a chain of Italian restaurants, plans to open next summer at Broadway and 47th Street with a multi-level dining room that will seat almost 500 people. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, a New Orleans-based chain, plans to open this fall at 148 West 51st Street, and will seat 275. And in November, Morton's of Chicago, a steakhouse chain, is to open a 150-seat restaurant on 45th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues. A.T.& T. Riding High On Flushing Phone Parlor    Based on the success of its nine-month-old international calling center in Flushing, Queens, A.T.& T. expects to open more such centers around New York City soon. The Global Communications Center, at 39-02 Main Street in Flushing, has nine phone booths where people can place calls around the world. It caters to clients who have limited phone service at home and don't want to pay the much higher rates at a pay phone. And it has A.T.& T. translators on hand to help place calls.  For Minority-Owned Businesses    Minority-owned companies in the Bronx can seek advice from a new business assistance office. The United States Department of Commerce recently opened the Bronx Minority Business Development Center, which offers marketing, financial and management tips, and construction assistance. Minority-owned businesses in Rockland and Westchester Counties can also use the center, at 1020 Grand Concourse in the Bronx. Charges for management and technological assistance will be subsidized by the Department of Commerce. Five More Stores For Nine West    Nine West, the manufacturer and retailer of women's shoes, recently opened two new stores in Manhattan: a flagship at Madison Avenue and 63d Street, and a store in the World Trade Center, and it plans three more in the next month. The company, based in Stamford, Conn., previously had six outlets in New York City.

These are just the sort of caprices that should be indulged on a trip to the West Side, where the slightly off-center is appreciated.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"Streetscapes/Wadleigh Secondary School; Renovating a 1902 Novelty","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/realestate/streetscapes-wadleigh-secondary-school-renovating-a-1902-novelty.html","abstract":"  LIKE many principals, Bruce Moody is worried about asbestos.

In 1856 she established the 12th Street Advanced School for Girls in the face of \"bitter opposition,\" according to The New York Times. She died in 1888 and in 1897 the city established its first official girls' high school in the building she used and named it for her.
