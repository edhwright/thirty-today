In a lopsided final, the top-seeded Spanish team, led by Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez, dominated the unseeded Australians, who were seeking their first title since 1974. Martinez, ranked sixth in the world, beat Michelle Jaggard-Lai, 6-0, 6-2, to put Spain ahead. Then Sanchez Vicario, No. 3 in the world, defeated Nicole Provis, 6-2, 6-3, to give Spain an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series.

Bolivia, which has not made the World Cup since 1950, scored twice in the final three minutes in what is surely the country's biggest soccer victory. Brazil, which won the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970, had gone 22-0-6 since it beat Chile, 2-0, in 1954 in its first World Cup qualifying game. The victory moved Bolivia to the top of the South American Group B standing with a 2-0-0 record. Brazil is 0-1-1, having tied Ecuador in its previous game. Also in Group B, Jose Herrera's goal early in the second half lifted Uruguay to a 1-0 victory over Venezuela in San Cristobal, Venezuela.

The 45-minute attack on the stadium, involving 68 tank and mortar shells, caused only slight injuries among the 100 French troops, who took shelter inside a barracks after the assault opened with machine-gun fire. But 10 French military vehicles valued at millions of dollars, including three armored troop carriers and three trucks, were set ablaze and destroyed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930726","headline":"China Denies Violating Pact By Selling Arms to Pakistan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/26/world/china-denies-violating-pact-by-selling-arms-to-pakistan.html","abstract":"  At a meeting with United States officials, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China denied today that Beijing had violated an international arms control agreement that bars it from exporting missile technology, a senior Administration official said.

Partly generated by machines, partly performed on instruments, the music has a dreamy sort of creep to it. Bleeps and squeaks multiply over a beat, and a song's logic seems almost mathematical, as if it were crystallizing on the spot.   The band, which didn't use vocals, knows exactly how to make people feel good, finding in some mixture of tempo, harmony and melody -- if electronic noise can called melody -- a warm sense of security. And the slow speed of permutation, along with the band's use of repetition, made the music comforting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930726","headline":"1918:Tsar's Last Hours : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/26/opinion/IHT-1918tsars-last-hours-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"STOCKHOLM - Svenska Dagbladet has details of the execution of the late Tsar Nicholas: \"Trotzky, having refused consent for the execution, the Tsar was taken to an estate near Ekaterinburg.

The seminar seeks to nurture and exploit rock from the fringes; Nirvana's second album, \"Nevermind\" (Geffen) came out of Seattle and the collegiate-rock netherworld in 1991 to sell four million copies, giving hope to scruffy growlers everywhere. By performing for a club-sized audience at the seminar -- with Jesus Lizard, an anti-pop riff-and-rant band, as opening act -- Nirvana thanked its earliest supporters while stoking interest in its next album, \"In Utero,\" (Geffen) due in September.    The band also reminded both old fans and skeptics why it blasted out of the club circuit in the first place: onstage, Nirvana is unstoppable. The band has the brute force of an old-fashioned power trio, the tunefulness of a pop group and the flippant, sloppy edges of great punk rock. It hasn't cleaned up its act; for the finale, Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's lyricist, ended up alone on stage for perhaps five minutes, kneeling over his guitar to hurl screeches and sustained wails of feedback into the room.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930726","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/26/nyregion/no-headline-282893.html","abstract":"  \"I think the press enjoys a good fall, and particularly  a good fall by someone who's younger and more successful and better looking than they are.

Under the plan, the bank would let Russians swap small amounts of pre-1993 rubles for new rubles, but would confiscate large ruble holdings. The policy was presented as a way to clamp down on inflation by cutting down excess ruble holdings in Russia and stemming the flow of rubles from neighboring republics.

Take the endgame: It is the phase of a game where, in general, quite a lot of material has come off the board and there are no mating attacks. Yet often a situation has to be treated as an endgame even though just a few pawns and the queens have been exchanged. Moreover, in a position that has been dominated for more than 20 moves by slow maneuvering, the chance for a mating attack can dramatically arise, even when there are only a few pieces left on the board.   So you must be alive to whatever fluctuating concrete opportunities come up, no matter what the general situation may be. The game between the Manhattan grandmaster Joel Benjamin and Aviv Friedman of Israel in the International Open Tournament in Marigot on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, from May 1 to May 8, shows how a mating attack can stunningly intrude into a quiet endgame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930727","headline":"Observer; Failure in Chic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/opinion/observer-failure-in-chic.html","abstract":"  I learn from Styles of The Times, my favorite guide to up-to-date dressing, that it is no longer de rigueur to have your jacket sleeve sewn to your jacket.

But he said it was also an attempt to meet what is likely to be one of the biggest domestic challenges the country will face in the 1990's: how to stem the increasing flow of illegal immigrants while maintaining the fundamental American commitment to legal immigration and legitimate political refugees.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930728","headline":"Bomb Attacks Kill 5 In Milan and Strike 2 Churches in Rome","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/28/world/bomb-attacks-kill-5-in-milan-and-strike-2-churches-in-rome.html","abstract":"  Car bombs rocked historic sites in Milan and Rome late last night and early today, killing at least five people and raising official concerns that Italy's political turmoil has unleashed a new wave of terrorism intended to destabilize the country.    \"At the very moment we are speaking of elections, at the moment at which anti-corruption investigations have reached a crucial point, I do not think that these attacks are a coincidence,\" said Francesco Saverio Borrelli, head of the magistrates investigating Italy's vast and still unfolding political corruption.

Voters amended the State Constitution to forbid both state and local governments from enacting any laws protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination. Last week the Colorado Supreme Court, in a creative and thoughtful opinion, struck down the measure as unconstitutional.    The state court, by recognizing that the measure's main vice was a form of disfranchisement for a targeted group of Americans, may have found a constitutional antidote for the political poison of gay-hating campaigners. The decision's reasoning could apply equally well to similar ballot maneuvers afoot in other states.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930728","headline":"Book Notes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/28/books/book-notes-562793.html","abstract":"    A Big Year for 'Bridges'","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930728","headline":"Youth Guilty in Pool Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/28/nyregion/youth-guilty-in-pool-case.html","abstract":"  A 17-year-old Bronx youth pleaded guilty yesterday to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a municipal swimming pool in Crotona Park during the Independence Day weekend, when a group of youths surrounded the girl in the water, pulled off her bathing suit and fondled her.

But the subject is important enough to bear some repeating.   By way of example, Mr. Brokaw visits an Ohio town whose General Motors plant, once its major employer, shut down in 1987. Since then, youngsters who would ordinarily have followed their parents onto the assembly line at union wages have had to settle for minimum-wage jobs in fast-food chains. Instead of rearing families and putting money in the bank, they are scrambling to get by, and prospects are bleak.
