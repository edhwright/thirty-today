On the other, the territory is thriving as the entry point for droves of international business people who want a piece of the booming Chinese mainland.\n\nCharacteristically, Hong Kong's six million people are responding to these dual pressures with great energy and a close eye on the bottom line. Construction is everywhere. Perfectly fine buildings are unhesitatingly torn down to make way for more profitable office towers.

A group of terrorists takes over a small television station in Los Angeles. These men, plus one smart and charismatic woman, call themselves the Green Army Commandos.

Made of wind- and water-repellent Supplex nylon, the 1620 is said to be both waterproof and breathable. It is trimmed with 200 square inches of silver Scotchlite reflective material, which makes the wearer visible on a clear night from 675 feet away. WHY: As authentic, high-tech street wear, it meets the style requirements of both ravers (who like to wear shiny, man-made fibers) and rappers (who have turned blue-collar staples like Carhartt and Dickies into fashion labels.) Patricia Field, the Greenwich Village emporium that specializes in club clothes, has been selling the 1620 jacket ($120) since last fall. \"It was the kids who discovered it and inspired us to buy it,\" said Annex Song, the manager of the store at 10 East Eighth Street. \"It wasn't something a company came up with to market to them.\" LIFELINE: The 1620 was conceived four years ago by I. Spiewak & Sons, a 90-year-old New York City uniform manufacturer that supplies clothes for police officers, airline mechanics and toll collectors, among others. The company spent two years developing and testing the jacket so that it would meet National Fire Protection Association standards. YOU BET YOUR LIFE: The jacket is designed to protect against blood-borne pathogens, which provides peace of mind to emergency health-care workers in the age of AIDS. AS SEEN IN SOHO: Phat Farm, on Prince Street, has the Spiewak coat (in blue or red) with the Phat Farm \"All City\" logo embroidered over the breast pocket; it costs $150. At the Anna Sui boutique on Greene Street, there is a black nylon coat with reflective tape that mimics the Spiewak version; it costs $415 (but was on sale last week for $335.) AS SEEN IN MILAN: The Spiewak coat has an upscale cousin: the ultra-chic, rather expensive industrial-strength nylon coat from Prada, the 81-year-old Italian leather-goods house. AS SEEN IN NEW JERSEY: When Katzins Uniform in Newark put the 1620 in its window, the hip-hop crowd, which was already buying coveralls and Carhartt parkas from the store, started making inquiries. \"It just proves that style knows no bounds,\" said Len Schlosberg, an owner, who is also the chairman of the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors. Katzins sells the 1620 for $181. (For an additional cost, the parka can be accessorized with matching protective pants and Hollofil or Thinsulate liners.) POETIC JUSTICE: At first, the 1620 seems like more protection than anyone but an Emergency Medical Service worker would need. But, alas, when one considers the dangers of city life today, it makes sense that a jacket designed for bloody medical emergencies would become a contemporary fashion statement.

Jade Palace, the county's newest Chinese restaurant, proves that statement. \n\nAlmost every dish we sampled was excellent, but since the restaurant was barely half full, we have withheld a higher rating until present standards can be maintained with a full house. \n\nForget grease and heavy sauces. Cantonese cooking is light and operates on the principle that the character of the ingredients should not be altered and each element should enhance every other one. Thus simple cooking methods are employed.\n\nBecause pure flavors are highly valued, freshness and variety are essential. And both are available in the abundance of fish and shellfish, tea, rice, peanuts, meats, poultry, vegetables and fruits resulting from the district's semitropical climate, fertile valleys and proximity to the South China Sea. \n\nThe menu is deceptively simple. The high quality of ingredients and their skillful preparation make dishes unusually delicious. Posted on the wall, a small menu of daily specials is written in Chinese, a practice common in Chinese restaurants. Owners want to please all their customers and fear that non-Chinese diners might dislike any unusual or unfamiliar tastes and take their patronage elsewhere. Those interested in a bit of experimentation or in simply what's up for the day should ask David Ng, the affable owner, for suggestions. \n\nSoups here are impressive, and just right for chilling winter days. The two we tried were superb: tender morsels of beef with parsley and egg white in one case and chunky dried scallops, squid and shrimp with shreds of yellow leek. Bring a friend, as these interesting soups are made for two.\n\nNor was seafood disappointing. With its fine texture and delicate flavor, steamed grass carp proved the ultimate in carp. When it's available, steamed flounder should also be considered. Tender squid starred in two delectable dishes: with fresh, homemade pickled mustard greens (light years from the often chokingly sour canned variety) and with a skim of breading in salt-and-pepper squid.\n\nPerfectly sauteed lobster (in the shell) with ginger and scallions was a fine version of a widely available dish, and succulent shrimps with hearts of cabbage were just as carefully handled. As good as Manhattan Chinatown's best, conch with anchovy sauce was paired with bean curd stuffed with minced shrimp. \n\nExceptionally light E-fu noodles, a Cantonese specialty, are often served at the end of a banquet. They made a satisfying addition to humbler meals. These delicious noodles are first fried, then dried and finally boiled and tossed with a vegetable or two, ours being sliced black mushrooms and safflower stalks.\n\nBeef-lovers will enjoy marinated short ribs, a tad peppery and succulent to the bone, and juicy cuts of beef with broccoli and loads of fragrant fresh ginger. Melt-in-your-mouth baby bok choy was also a treat. \n\nFor dessert there's ice cream and soothing, sweet tapioca and peanut soup. An a la carte dinner averages $14 without drinks, tax and tip. Jade Palace is in the Acropolis Plaza, south of the A.&P.;\nJade Palace\nVery Good \n694 Central Avenue, Scarsdale. 472-8888.\n\nAtmosphere: Bright dining room. Fine service.\n\nRecommended dishes: Soups, grass carp, salt and pepper squid, squid with homemade pickle, shrimps with hearts of cabbage, conch with anchovy sauce, shrimp-stuffed bean curd, beef short ribs with pepper sauce, beef with broccoli, baby bok choy.\n\nPrices: Lunch, $4.95 to $5.75 (soup and white rice included).

This is pertinent because one of the items Santa should be distributing this season is THE HISTORICAL ATLAS OF NEW YORK CITY: A Visual Celebration of Nearly 400 Years of New York City's History (Holt, $45). The book, by Eric Homberger, who teaches American studies at the University of East Anglia in England, may be as close to a printed CD-ROM as paper can get; it is a triumph of graphics, with text, maps and photographs sharing space in a variety of colors, typefaces and layouts. These brilliant displays are built around Mr. Homberger's history of the city from precolonial days to the current 42d Street renewal. It is a fair and lucid commentary that includes a plethora of relevant and not-so-relevant but descriptive detail. Although other boroughs are mentioned and mapped, this is essentially a Manhattan book, and no less interesting for that. Alice Hudson, chief of the New York Public Library's Map Division, has presided over a magnificent assortment of maps that, with other charts and graphs, tells the reader about the bewildering demographics of the city. The material, which might otherwise seem too academic, comes to life in these clear-cut, simplified expositions. Most useful is the chronology that wraps up the city's history -- a hodgepodge of notable incident and era-dividing development. The spread of material across the pages may seem difficult to assimilate all at once, but you do not need to -- it is a book that lends itself remarkably well to dip-and-flip reading. RICHARD F.

While leading actresses languish or play thankless roles, men continue to tough it out in the most competitive of all movie awards categories: best supporting actor.   This year turned out to be a particularly brutal one for supporting actor candidates and once again we see why these secondary roles boast a disproportionate share of talent.

This is what I thrive on.\"\n\n Bash, which buys its equipment from hundreds of manufacturers and has branches in Orlando, Fla., Baltimore, and Las Vegas, is one of three top theatrical lighting companies in the country that compete for stage productions, political conventions, music videos and other television production work, Mr. Stern said. In the New York region, he has competitors in Westchester County and Long Island, he said.\n\n Contracts are awarded by bids, ranging from lavish New York productions like \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"A Christmas Carol,\" to a high school show. While noting that Broadway shows often budget 15 percent of their start-up costs for lighting, Mr. Stern said that even though most of his profit comes from such extravaganzas, it is important not to ignore the small jobs, because the youngster who rents one light may someday be the biggest lighting designer in the country.\n\n In competing for business, Mr. Stern said, \"Believe me, we're walking a tightrope\" among managers, who want to get the job done inexpensively; lighting designers, who want creativity but at a low price, and a show's stage electricians who look for equipment that is easy to operate.\n\n After a contract is awarded, the company is sent a blueprint with the total amount of equipment, like lamps, cable, dimmers and control consoles that will be needed. After Bash cleans and focuses the equipment and sometimes designs special effects, the show sends its own electricians to label each part for positioning in the theater.\n\n Bash's building houses thousands of lights and miles of cable, said Mr. Stern, noting that today's productions use about five times as much equipment as was needed 30 years ago, and it is much more sophisticated. Now, a three-foot computer board can operate hundreds of lights all over the theater.\n\n Despite the sophistication of today's equipment, the company's tasks require flexibility, too, Mr. Stern said. \"You have to be prepared to change at a moment's notice,\" he said, recalling the time that his company had set up lights for a news conference by President Ronald Reagan. But the President \"came down another way,\" had the equipment had to be moved hastily.\n\n \"And you'd better have a backup generator standing by if the lights go down or if the place isn't equipped for enough power,\" Mr. Stern said. \"You might be doing an outdoor pageant like the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the promoters want to know why you have to have all these units. Well, suppose it starts to rain, then what?\"\n\n Mr. Stern, who is 55, has been running Bash for 19 years. He has a partner, Bobby Cannon, who manages operations. Mr. Stern says he sleeps no more than three hours a night and gets to the office by 6:30 every morning and stays late. He manages to squeeze in racquetball three nights a week, he said, and spends some weekends showing off his four vintage 1957 to 1959 Chevys in local car shows.\n\n Mr. Stern has a background as a stage electrician.\n\n \"I was just starting college, majoring in accounting, when my father died,\" he said. \"He had been a stagehand, and my mother called the union and got me work as a journeyman electrician. I got $35 on my first day, which was a lot back then. It was a Burt Reynolds movie, and I remember him breaking something on his body that day while doing a stunt.\"\n\n Mr. Stern promptly quit college and began a career backstage. Work was exciting, he said, and he got to travel all over the country. Every day brought something different, but eventually, working days, nights and holidays took a toll.\n\n \"In 1975, I bought into Bash as a partner,\" Mr. Stern said. \"The original guys were ready to get out, and I wanted to settle down. After I was here, though, I found that a lot of inventory I thought I had in stock was just empty boxes. I went to everyone I knew to try to get business from them. I told them: 'I want an opportunity. Give me a shot.\"'\n\n His perseverance paid off. Bash was hired to illuminate three Broadway shows, including \"Oh! Calcutta!\" The assignments took almost all the company's inventory, 600 lights. Yet that initial venture as almost the end of Bash lighting.\n\n \"I'd severely underpriced the shows, now we had no products to rent out to anyone else, there was very little revenue, coming in, and I felt so bad I didn't sleep for three weeks,\" Mr. Stern said. \"It's not very nice to hope and pray that a show closes, but that's what I had to do. Luckily, two of them did. What a lesson to learn.\"\n\n After that, Mr. Stern said, the company began to do well, growing 20 to 30 percent a year ever since. Bash employs a staff of 65 and will soon open a new branch in Chicago. But, Mr. Stern said, he will never depend entirely on the company's reputation in the industry.\n\n \"My peers are on a top level, but the wheel keeps turning,\" he said. \"We have seminars here for designers and their young assistants and college kids from Bergen Community College and Montclair State College who want to learn about the business. We show them as much as they want, so we can make a difference with the next generation who will be running backstages. They say, 'Donny, how can I make this work?,' and I'm happy to tell them all I know.\"\n\n Mr. Stern says he is not stagestruck at all, although he goes to all the openings.\n\n \"I look to see how a show is lit,\" Mr. Stern said. \"In 'Sunset Boulvevard,' there is the two spin, giving the impression of a ripple effect in the water scene. That's what turns me on. I'm a gimmick man.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"Beloved Cartoon Characters Star in Two Shows","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/nyregion/art-beloved-cartoon-characters-star-in-two-shows.html","abstract":"  THE playful ring to Walt Disney's name, plus his chubby signature with a circle over the i instead of a dot, seems of a piece with his accomplishment.

As the guest curator, John Canemaker, relates in the catalogue, Tytla's mother was born in Poland, the daughter of an architect with aristocratic pretensions; his father, a Galician, served in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry.

Federal prosecutors assert that the recording, made on Oct. 13 by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation eavesdropping on Officer Davis's calls as part of a drug investigation, revealed a contract killing ordered by Officer Davis. Twenty minutes later, Ms. Groves was dead, and an exultant cry of \"Yeah!\" crackled over Officer Davis's phone. \"Rock, rock-a-bye,\" he said cheerfully from his patrol car.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941219","headline":"One Who Will Miss The Quindlen Touch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/19/opinion/l-one-who-will-miss-the-quindlen-touch-154903.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Anna Quindlen's conversations in print have touched the lives of millions of people.

The new Speaker of the House has already called for its privatization as part of the pulverization of the public trough, and the debate to come may occupy Jim Lehrer even after Robert MacNeil privatizes himself. Newt Gingrich's intention seems to me misconceived, but difficult though it may be for friends of public broadcasting to get these words out, the man has a case.   To begin, why is it necessary, say in the New York City area, for a half-dozen public stations to carry so many of the same programs? Public broadcasting remains a set of uncoordinated, chronically uncooperative fiefdoms. If Mr. Gingrich can bring order to a messy system by sorting out educational programming, community programming and national programming and by reducing duplication (without eliminating competition), who, besides the people who may have to find more productive jobs, will object? PBS would be doing itself a favor if it came up with a comprehensive and comprehensible reorganization plan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941219","headline":"Carter Is in Sarajevo, But No Progress Is Reported","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/19/world/carter-is-in-sarajevo-but-no-progress-is-reported.html","abstract":"  Former President Jimmy Carter stepped into the war-torn vestiges of Sarajevo today, proclaiming that Bosnia was a \"fine country\" but saying nothing to suggest that he could resolve its deep divisions.

Although Ms. Khan is capable of vocal virtuosity, she's after something else. Ever since her first recordings, in 1974, she has had an easy way with intimacy, using an enveloping voice that equates closeness with sexuality. Ms. Khan is sexual when she sings, but not in an obvious way; instead of the raucousness of the bump and grind, or even the eroticism of secrecy a whisper can suggest, she manipulates by being a friend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941220","headline":"U.N.
