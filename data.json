One work was by David Earle, who founded Toronto Dance Theater in 1968 in association with Peter Randazzo and Patricia Beatty and who remains its artistic director.

It's either an uplifting or depressing story, depending on whether you view it as an example of perseverance rewarded or as an example of how stacked the odds are against the financial success of a Broadway musical. On Nov. 15, after 725 performances and 91 weeks at the Shubert Theater, \"Crazy for You,\" the reconstituted Gershwin musical, finally earned back the $8.3 million its investors pumped into it. The specific records aren't kept anywhere, but according to some of Broadway's most reliable memories, perhaps only \"Grand Hotel,\" which took exactly two years, has recouped its investment on Broadway over a longer span. (Many shows, of course, have run longer, but they either broke into profit sooner -- \"Miss Saigon,\" for instance, recouped a $10 million investment after 39 weeks -- or, in a few cases, like the $7.5 million \"Will Rogers Follies,\" never did.)    Even for a Tony-winner like \"Crazy for You,\" this is the official crossing of the line from flop to hit, so let's call it uplifting. Anyway, the show has performed well all along, weekly filling more than 80 percent of the Shubert's 1,465 seats and often earning $450,000 or more a week. There is currently a $3.5 million advance. The reason recoupment has taken so long, said Roger Horchow, one of the show's producers (his partner is Elizabeth Williams), is that its running expenses are high -- about $375,000 a week -- and that even though larger theaters were available, the producers insisted on the Shubert because its old-style ambiance complemented the Gershwinian spirit of the show, which is an adaptation of the Gershwins' 1930 opus, \"Girl Crazy.\" So the producers knew it would take an extended run to get their money back and decided to go ahead, anyway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931203","headline":"No More Scot-Free Scofflaws","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/03/opinion/no-more-scot-free-scofflaws.html","abstract":"  At long last, Washington has agreed to recognize the sovereign right of New York City to ticket and collect fines on illegally parked cars with diplomatic license plates.

In other words, our streets, our rules; offenders who don't pay up lose their plates. Admittedly, the agreement is far from perfect. Automobiles registered to ambassadors (as compared with consulate cars) will remain diplomatically immune from tickets at parking meters and in some no-parking zones. And the overall number of diplomatic plates issued here, some 6,000 in all, still seems far too high, given the easy access to cabs and public transportation.

All are visited during the presentation, which uses mime, movement and narration, as well as song, to dramatize various cultures' stories and poems. (If you miss the show tomorrow, the ensemble is also to be performed in Manhattan in late December at Theater Four in Clinton.)   Among the folk tales is \"The Monkey Who Asked for Misery,\" a Haitian story in which an unfortunate ape sees a woman drop a calabash of honey on her way home from the market. After the woman curses the gods for her misery and goes on her way, the monkey samples the sweet stuff and says, \"Mmm, I want misery.\" Of course, he gets his wish. The traditional interpretation is that the tale warns against wanting something too much; perhaps a contemporary interpretation is that it's a good idea to learn the meaning of a word before you use it.   The poetry selections include Edgar Allan Poe's \"Raven\" and Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" as well as rhythmic favorites by Dr. Seuss. Children should be prepared to yell as well as look and listen. They will be asked to play both villain and heroes in the chorus of \"The True Story of the Three Little Pigs.\" They will also be given a copy of \"The Story of the Nutcracker Ballet.\"   Tickets to the 2 P.M. show, which lasts just over an hour, are $6; $5 for children under 12.

Ten minutes later, Arkansas was in front by 38-15. (AP) Oklahoma State 87, Arizona State 69: Bryant Reeves dominated beneath the basket and scored a career-high 34 points last night to lead No. 8 Oklahoma State over Arizona State in Tulsa, Okla. Reeves, a 7-foot junior, scored 24 points in the second half, including all 12 of the Cowboys' points during one five-minute run. The Sun Devils rotated players against him but to no avail. (AP) Georgia Tech 77, W. Carolina 55: In Atlanta, Fred Vinson, who was starting in place of the injured James Forrest, scored 15 points as No. 17 Georgia Tech (2-1) beat Western Carolina (1-1). Forrest, the Yellow Jackets' leading scorer and rebounder, sat out with a mild bruise of his right heel. (AP) SWIMMING Chinese Set Records  Chinese female swimmers, who emerged as a world force in last year's Olympics, set three world short-course records and won four gold medals yesterday on the opening day of the short-course world championship in Palma, Majorca. The Chinese women, who won four Olympic gold medals and five silvers in Barcelona, Spain, won all four women's finals and set three world marks in the process. Guohoug Dai of China swam the 400-meter individual medley in 4:29, topping the old mark of 4:31.36 set in 1987 by a Romanian, Noemy Lung. Jinyi Le erased a record set by Franziska van Almsick of Germany in the 100-meter free style, swimming a time of 53.01. The previous record, set in 1992, was 53.33. The other Chinese record came in the 800-meter freestyle relay with a time of 7:52.45, topping a mark of 7:58.74 set by the United States in 1981.

Since then, though, nothing has gone right for Shimer.    The United States has no Olympic-caliber bobsled run, so the American team spent its autumn training in Europe. It has been difficult finding sufficient time to train and test new sleds, Shimer said in a telephone interview from Lillehammer. Unfamiliar food hasn't helped, either. The members of his team have all dropped 5 to 10 pounds, Shimer said, which saps strength needed for a critical part of any bobsled race, the 50-meter push start. Throw in a calf injury suffered by Shimer, and it's no wonder that his team has had trouble finishing in the top 10, much less the top three, on the early World Cup circuit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931204","headline":"Sparks, If Healthy, Has Job Security","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/04/sports/football-giants-notebook-sparks-if-healthy-has-job-security.html","abstract":"  Cornerback Phillipi Sparks need not worry.

City officials said they thought this was the first law in the country specifically aimed at barring such bias in places that are generally open to the public.

Mr. Bratton argued that a tolerance for such minor infractions of the law has demoralized police officers and contributed to the city's sense of menace. A Change in Approach    \"As minute a problem as that might seem in the overall scope of a city with 2,000 murders, squeegees are of great significance,\" said Mr. Bratton, now the Boston Police Commissioner, \"because like fare evasion and like disorder on the subways, it's that type of activity that is generating fear.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931204","headline":"Cal Names a New A.D.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/04/sports/sports-people-college-sports-cal-names-a-new-ad.html","abstract":"  JOHN V.

Given that bad news, the advisers produced a \"menu\" of deficit reduction options, virtually all so painful or politically risky that their chances seem slim.
