Such a device could materialize by the year 2002 if the dream machine gets approval from the Department of Energy. It would cost $1 billion to build and about $250 million a year to operate -- no small sum over a 30-year lifetime -- and Congress may well balk at its cost. It would be the world's first device to produce controlled thermonuclear ignition, a phenomenon better known for lighting stars and powering hydrogen bombs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940621","headline":"The Majority of Vietnam Vets Enlisted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/21/opinion/l-the-majority-of-vietnam-vets-enlisted-457639.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a Vietnam veteran I read \"Clinton's War Story\" by Frank Rich (column, June 5) with interest, especially where he writes of the \"dirty little secret,\" that the Vietnam War was \"America's most blatant class war since the Civil War.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940621","headline":"Bouts of Poetry (the Stress Is on Beat)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/21/us/bouts-of-poetry-the-stress-is-on-beat.html","abstract":"  In the left corner of the ring was the 5-foot, 6-inch, 150-pound defending champion, Simon Ortiz; in the right corner, the 6-foot, 2-inch, 250-pound challenger, Quincy Troupe.

The ballerina must move from large prayerful stances, hands and head cast slightly upward, to edgily precise pure dance with frequent changes of direction.

For one thing, the lag between a politician's moment in history and the subsequent book is often ample for the public to forget the person or lose interest. For another, publishers are so susceptible to famous people -- even if the people are famous simply because they did some relatively minor thing during some administration or other -- that they often pay too high an advance, print too many copies and end up with too many unsold books. \"It is indeed a tough judgment call, and we've all made mistakes,\" said Caroline K. Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division.    But this month, publishers who bet lots of money on books by politicians have good reason to be pleased with themselves. In a curious confluence of events, three political books are enjoying long runs on the nonfiction best-seller lists. These are \"Standing Firm\" (HarperCollins/Zondervan), by Dan Quayle; \"Beyond Peace\" (Random House), by Richard Nixon, and \"The Haldeman Diaries\" (Putnam), by H. R. Haldeman. \"All these books are selling much better than we expected,\" said Susie Russenberger, director of trade books at Ingram, a book wholesaler.

Four months after Mr. Mitchell disclosed plans to retire at the end of 1994, only two of the Senate's 55 other Democrats -- Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Jim Sasser of Tennessee -- have offered themselves as a replacement. Neither is a household name, and their efforts to win support from fellow Democrats, while vigorous, are all but subterranean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940623","headline":"Selig Chides Players Union","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/sports/baseball-selig-chides-players-union.html","abstract":"  Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, yesterday issued a statement in which he chided the Players Association for its involvement in the attempt by some United States senators to strip baseball of its exemption from the antitrust law as it pertains to labor relations.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to act on a bill that would put baseball club owners and their players on the same footing in collective bargaining as owners and players in professional basketball and football.

The atmosphere would be genial and festive, with dinner on the lawn before the opera. The repertory would draw heavily on contemporary works and neglected 18th- and 19th-century scores, with familiar works as the icing rather than the cake. The operas would be sung in English, mostly by young Americans. And the house -- the 950-seat Loretto-Hilton Center -- would be intimate enough for the singers to be heard and understood without forcing.   In 19 seasons, the company's budget has grown to nearly $5 million from $139,000, and the number of performances has grown to 30 from 13. Nine years ago, Mr. Gaddes handed the reigns to Charles MacKay, the general manager, and Colin Graham, the artistic director, and although they clearly have their own ideas about opera presentation, they have largely upheld Mr. Gaddes's original vision. This season's offerings are Gluck's \"Iphigenia in Tauris,\" Verdi's \"Falstaff\" and revised versions of two 20th-century American works, Conrad Susa's \"Black River\" and Leonard Bernstein's \"Candide.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940623","headline":"Youth Is Convicted in Murder for a Bicycle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/nyregion/c-youth-is-convicted-in-murder-for-a-bicycle-208795.html","abstract":"  A Brooklyn teen-ager was convicted of murder yesterday in the killing ofAllyn Winslow, 42, a drama teacher who was shot in the back last June as a groupof teen-agers tried to steal his bicycle in Prospect Park.

So there's the inevitable point, befitting a performance where the star wears pajamas, when her eyelids grow leaden and her head so heavy that she bumps it against a lamp. She wakens to recall a childhood dream that was so realistic it influenced her behavior in school the next day; its unfortunate consequences will be familiar to anyone who remembers the social mores of second-grade friendships.   The fact that any performance -- and life itself -- is a minefield of potential embarrassments provides both the form and content of this blissful piece of theater of abashment. The show \"101 Humiliating Stories\" (there are only 17, actually, but each has numerous subsets) is a chain of artfully paced narratives of excruciating moments recollected in, well, not exactly tranquillity, but with the modulated control of a master comic eternally poised between ingenuousness and irony.   Ms. Kron, who is a member of the theater troupe Five Lesbian Brothers, combines a novelist's sense of the telling social detail with a Chaplinesque knowledge of the humor in the yawning gap between intention and action (or, as she puts it, between the self you see in your mirror at home and the one that leaps out at you from store windows). She realizes, as she tells us, brushing a sheaf of papers to the floor, that there's \"a second set of behaviors that I exhibit to people that I am not aware of.\"   This premise infuses autobiographical tales that cover all manner of faux pas: stories of hair caught in school-bus doors; of \"geeky celebrity encounters\"; of fainting in the corridors of a Michigan junior high school in a green-and-white polyester gym suit; of speculating, with wicked specificity, on the horrific events that must have led to the abandonment of a sanitary napkin spotted near the entrance of the same institution and of walking down the halls of a business office with a skirt tucked into a pair of pantyhose.   All of the anecdotes, in fact, are spiritually akin to the sorts of dreams in which you find yourself naked before a crowd. They are linked by a series of scenes in which Ms. Kron imagines herself addressing her Lansing, Mich., high school reunion, explaining -- in styles ranging from cringing to confrontational -- both her sexual and professional identities. No alternative, of course, is safe when you're standing behind a podium.   The show, which has been artfully staged by John Robert Hoffman and was first presented in a rougher form at the Serious Fun festival last summer, is part of the Gay Games and Cultural Festival. The question of how Ms. Kron presents herself as a lesbian to the world at large (and particularly to her former classmates) is a prime source of the social awkardness she describes. But \"101 Humiliating Stories,\" at the New York Theater Workshop through July 2, is really for anyone who has ever had cause to blush. 101 Humiliating Stories  Written and performed by Lisa Kron; directed by John Robert Hoffman; set by Amy Shock; costume by Jose Gutierrez and Chip White; production stage manager, Janet M.
