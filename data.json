Their concern was prompted by the smuggling of nuclear fuel from Russia this summer -- most recently, a 10.5-ounce shipment of plutonium seized this month in the Munich airport. Yet the NATO leaders ignored a far more serious strategic threat that is gathering momentum in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia and other former Soviet republics have pressed forward with plans to create a military alliance that mocks President Clinton's Partnership for Peace, doing precisely what that proposal was designed to avoid: creating new Eastern and Western blocs. More ominously, even as nuclear weapons are being withdrawn from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, many in the Russian military and political elite want to reassert authority to protect former Soviet republics with Russia's nuclear arsenal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/nyregion/metro-digest-093807.html","abstract":"  RAISING MATH AND SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS   In two weeks, New York City high schools will begin an ambitious effort to raise the math and science requirements for nearly all its students.

And most of the time, the doctor can confidently and joyfully boom out the verdict.   Every so often, however, the answer is not immediately obvious. The infant may look as though it has a penis but there is little or no scrotum to be found, leading those in the delivery room to wonder whether they are seeing a boy with undescended testes or a girl with a greatly enlarged clitoris. Or it may later turn out that a newborn with the external genitals of a boy has a female's ovaries inside. As many as 1 in 1,000 babies are born with some sort of gender ambiguity, throwing the parents into an emotional maelstrom and forcing them to confront decisions like whether their child should be surgically modified and how, exactly, they should regard their androgynous offspring.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"Amid Doubts, Schools Tackle Upgrade of Math and Science","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/nyregion/amid-doubts-schools-tackle-upgrade-of-math-and-science.html","abstract":"  In less than two weeks, New York City high schools will begin what may be the most ambitious undertaking by a major urban school system, raising the math and science requirements for nearly all its students.

One after another, and then by the dozens, rafts began appearing in the water in front of Havana's oceanfront, known as the Malecon, and a few miles east at Cojimar, which has become the main launching point for those who want to escape from Cuba. Many of the Cubans had been camping on the beaches for days, waiting for the weather to improve.   Trucks also began arriving, depositing people who had come from Alamar in the east and Pinar del Rio in the west, 120 miles away. The trucks carried boats that the refugees had been building at their homes. Because of the current in the Florida Straits, the coast around Havana is the best launching area for the mostly unpowered boats.    Hundreds of well-wishers lined the beaches near Havana as the exodus resumed. A Weather Predicter    No one has been able to predict the flow of refugees, but the weather has been one prognosticator, even better than pleas by Fidel Castro or President Clinton.    Indeed, there has been less science and method involved in how many people have left than there has been strong emotion, including anger at Cuba's economic deterioration and impatience to get on with what everyone knows is a perilous journey.   [ Despite the ample evidence that the number of Cubans leaving was rising sharply, relatively few were picked up by the Coast Guard. As of 10 P.M. Monday, 253 Cubans had been intercepted, up from 84 on Sunday. Last week, in the first rush, the Coast Guard picked up 13,600. ]   \"Tell my mother that I have gone and that I am very happy,\" Marbel Betancourt Gonzalez said just before she jumped into the turquoise waters of Cojimar to scramble onto a rubber and wooden raft with 10 others. Miss Betancourt, who had slept on the beach for nine days waiting for her journey, turned to face the crowd of hundreds of people piled on a crumbling sea wall, and with tears in her eyes she waved and blew kisses.   It is impossible to predict how many Cubans will leave in this wave, but today's activity indicates that the United States policy to deny them automatic asylum will not keep many people at home.   In fact, some of the Cubans say there is an urgency about leaving now.   Two brothers, Felipe and Jesus, came from Pinar del Rio, about 125 miles west of Cojimar, to leave from Cuba in a boat that they had assembled by soldering together pieces of aluminum, then painting it over with tar and padding the inside with plastic foam.   \"We're afraid Mr. Castro is going to say, 'No more,' so we have to leave now,\" Jesus said. \"We came here because this is the closest point to the United States, and it is a good place to launch a boat.\"   The brothers also said that on their stretch of the coast the Government's coast guards still seemed to be patrolling the waters. At Cojimar, there were only a few soldiers in camouflage uniforms, and they did not seem to bother the people leaving. First Boat Leaves    The first boat to leave this morning from Cojimar was a tidy contraption of rubber and wood. It, too, had come on a truck, and it had a wooden rudder and a bow made of aluminum, with lines of thin rope on its perimeter for its passengers to hold onto and a jaunty red yachting flag atop its rough-hewn mast.   One by one people boarded the boat, as hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the littered beach to see them off. A festive atmosphere pervailed. Vendors were selling tamales and guanabo turnovers. The only ones not laughing were the six women and nine men who pushed off, rowing at the direction of an older man who was clearly their captain.   Some people were dispensing advice. One man told a would-be refugee how to judge how far his raft was from tankers that navigate the straits. He told him to hold his hand out in front of him in a fist, with his thumb sticking skyward, and to close one eye. \"If your thumb covers the whole tanker, then he's 10 miles away,\" the older man told the younger one.    Some carried good-luck charms on board. One boat had the Virgin of Charity on its bow. One refugee tried to take his dog on the raft, but the animal ran down a dock away from him.    Ramon Perez Lara, who is 61, was at the beach helping his son Sergio, who would be making about his 30th attempt to leave. The two men personify the debate about whether it is better to abandon Cuba or to stay and make it better.    Mr. Perez fought in the revolution. His family grew tobacco and corn on their small parcel of land, but the inequities of life before Castro's rule left the countryside poor of many things Cubans now have, he said.    \"I learned to read and write after the revolution,\" he said proudly.    But his son, Sergio Lara Caras, has felt let down by the revolution. He made his first attempt to try to leave Cuba on a home-made boat five years ago, when he was 29, and he has been trying ever since. Twice he was picked up by Soviet tankers and turned over to the Cuban authorities.   He has been in prison three times for his so-called treasonous crimes, and has served as long as eight months. He has gotten as far as 35 miles out to sea, far short of the 90 miles to Florida.    \"Castro has turned my struggle into something political by saying I am betraying the country,\" Mr. Lara said. \"But it is only economic. This country does not have opportunities for me anymore. Because I have been arrested for trying to leave, I cannot get the kind of work that will help me have a life.\"   With tears streaming down her face, Berta Serrano Belot waved from the beach to a raft carrying her oldest daughter, 30, and her youngest son, 18.    \"For a mother this is the biggest pain in my entire life, to see my children leaving,\" said Mrs. Serrano, holding a granddaughter's hand.    Another daughter's husband was also on the boat, along with others from their town of San Miguel del Padron, about a three-hour bus ride from here. They had come to Cojimar as a family 12 days ago, and had camped on the beach.    They spent their days scavenging for bits of lumber and other material to build their boat. They bought what they needed with the money they got from selling many of their possessions back home. They had only a few pesos each day to buy bread.    But finally today, those who wanted to go were on their way.    \"I never thought my children would abandon me, but the ruin this country has fallen into has created such misery and hunger that it has forced them to go,\" Mrs. Serrano said, her voice trembling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/style/chronicle-094153.html","abstract":"  ISMAIL MERCHANT, the film producer, and JAMES IVORY, the film director, were hosts of a benefit concert and dinner on Saturday night for the Merchant & Ivory Foundation, a four-year-old nonprofit organization that operates a film center in Claverack, N.Y.

As the November elections approach, Pequot money is flowing across the country in abundant and increasing amounts, to Albany and Hartford as well as Des Moines and Sacramento. And virtually all of it is going to Democrats.   In just the last few months, the tribe -- whose roughly 300 members are expected to earn about $600 million from the casino this year -- has given $100,000 each to the Democratic Party organizations in New York and California and $50,000 to the state party committee in Iowa, all at the direction of national party leaders. It has pledged $250,000 for other state campaigns still to be named. And with total donations of $315,000 over the last two years, it has become one of the single largest contributors to the Democratic Party's National Committee, joining the ranks of huge corporations like Time Warner and big unions like the National Education Association.   What all this means, for the Pequots and the Democrats, is an open question.   Lobbyists and lawyers for the tribe say that Democrats have been good to the Pequots, and American Indians generally, and that across a broad spectrum of issues, from health care to education, the tribal council believes that the Clinton Administration is on the right track. Local Democrats helped the tribe gain Federal recognition in the 1980's -- an old debt that can now be repaid -- and Mr. Clinton held an American Indian summit at the White House in April that was viewed by the Pequots as symbolically significant.   And while some critics grouse that the tribe is only furthering its economic interests as the owner of a huge gambling enterprise, there is little evidence of a Pequot agenda.   The Republican National Committee has offered no comment on the donations or the tribe. Democratic officials in the states getting money say they have had no contact with the tribe, and in the states closest to the casino -- Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- where the tribe would presumably have the keenest interest in influencing debate about gambling, the Pequots and Democrats say there have been no contributions at all.   But people in both parties say that the tribe has found a quick way to become a player in the game of politics. While the size of contributions to individual candidates is limited, the tribe can give as much as it wants to the state and national parties, gaining the maximum good will from party leaders.   \"I would imagine that all they're trying to do is expand their influence,\" said State Senator James T. Fleming, a Connecticut Republican and an opponent of casino gambling. \"As long as it's legal, I don't see anything wrong with it.\"   In Connecticut, the tribe formed a political action committee in July that could under state law give unlimited amounts to candidates. Tribal lawyers said they were also considering forming a national PAC.   Earlier this month, Carrie Saxon Perry, a former Mayor of Hartford and a Democratic candidate for the State Senate, held a fund-raiser at the casino, on the tribe's reservation in Ledyard. Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, a third-party candidate for governor, plans to do a star turn there next month, at a $250-to-$500-a-ticket fund-raiser in a hotel ballroom. Expanded Lobbying Efforts    The tribe has expanded its lobbying efforts, too. It opened a Washington office this year, and a in Hartford this spring its largess surpassed even that of Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino developer who has spent millions in Connecticut over the last few years to try to end the Pequots' monopoly on casino gambling in the state. The Pequots paid a Hartford public relations company $210,000 through mid-June, compared with the $152,000 spent by Mr. Wynn on lobbying, according to the State Ethics Commission.   Experts in American Indian affairs said that many tribes have long had political action committees, and that political contributions have gone up in the last few years. But the Pequots, if only by their grand scale of doing things, still get the attention.   And like all of their previous efforts to test themselves and their newfound economic sovereignty -- from the expansion of land claims to the development of a Pequot legal code -- the new flexing of political muscle is also sparking anxieties about where the tribe is going and what it will do when it gets there.   A lobbyist for the tribe, Charles J. Duffy, said that those \"sensitivities\" had led the tribal council to take what state elections officials say is an extraordinary step: the Pequots will limit contributions to local candidates from its new state PAC, even though it does not have to.   Mr. Duffy said the tribe would consider donations to Democratic and Republican candidates, but will hold donations to the same maximum allowed for business PACs, which can donate only up to $5,000 to a gubernatorial campaign and $500 to an individual state legislative race, with a $100,000 cap on all contributions.   \"We don't want people who are averse to the tribe to be making egregious claims about what the tribe is doing and what it intends to do,\" Mr. Duffy said.   That has not stopped people from questioning, however, why a small tribe would ship its money so far from home.   \"It is my belief that any sound-thinking person would ask why, in this case, an Indian nation would send a significant donation to a political party or elected official in another state,\" said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester County Republican who asked this month for a Federal investigation into the Pequots' $100,000 contribution to the New York Democratic Party.   Mr. Spano, an advocate of casino gambling in New York, said in a letter to the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, that the State Legislature's defeat in July of an amendment legalizing casinos came within days of the tribe's donation, and that the appearances and timing were questionable, though he had no direct evidence of any wrongdoing.   Chris McNeil, a tribal lawyer who heads the Washington lobbying effort, said the Pequots had had absolutely no contact with New York Democrats, and that the state committees that have received money were all suggested by the Democratic National Committee as places where Democrats could use extra help this year.   \"There's no connection,\" Mr. McNeil said, referring to the gambling issue in New York and the tribe's contribution.   Still, party officials in Iowa and California said that even though the Pequots' national political agenda is vague, their ability to write big checks has not gone unnoticed.  Keeping Track of Friends    Mike Monasmith, a spokesman for the California Democratic Party, said the money had come with no strings attached, but that, if only to protect itself, the party always knows who its friends are.   \"We are sure to make sure we know where they money is coming from,\" Mr. Monasmith said.   In Iowa, Democrats said the Pequots had asked for nothing in exchange for their $50,000 donation.   \"We have some good Congressional races and a good chance of knocking out a Republican governor, but how that ties in to the tribe's agenda, I'm not certain,\" said Ron Parker, a spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party. \"We have no contact with the Indians.\"   Here in Connecticut, where the tribe clearly does have an established agenda -- to keep non-Indian gambling operations out of the state -- politicians said they hoped the new Pequot PAC would be low-key about any kind of loyalty pledge.   \"It should not be a single-issue PAC and I don't think it will be,\" said Edward L. Marcus, the Connecticut Democratic Party chairman. \"I'm not sure that would make too many candidates all that comfortable.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"For Ex-Judge Wachtler, Real Estate by Day, Card Games and Meatloaf at Night","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/nyregion/for-ex-judge-wachtler-real-estate-by-day-card-games-and-meatloaf-at-night.html","abstract":"  During the day, Sol Wachtler will broker real-estate deals from a glass high-rise in an affluent section of Long Island.

Some modern-dance choreographers and companies do not even announce new casting. But given Paul Taylor's quirky impulses and his somewhat teasing delight in his dancers, \"Company B\" as danced by an entirely new cast promised to be interesting. And it was, in a performance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Saturday night at the Damrosch Park Band Shell, presented by the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival.    One revelation of the performance was how quickly one begins to associate individual dancers with specific roles. When \"Company B\" was first presented in 1991, the stars of the dance seemed to be the Andrews Sisters, to whose songs the piece was set. As the high of that nutty music wore off, Mr. Taylor stepped into the star role, pouring dance out onto the stage that captured the war years of the 1940's and made subtle use of period social dances but also revealed, even more subtly, the dark subtext of many of the songs. Bobby-soxers and their boys next door kick up their heels with abandon in \"Company B.\" But every so often a dancer drops to the floor and lies still as the dance goes on. And from time to time men move slowly across the back in single file, a frieze of young ghosts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Karen Moller, a Canadian consultant on fabric trends for Trend Union, a fashion consulting firm, is reading Camille Paglia's book, \"'Sexual Personae.\".\"It's a feminist anti-feminist book, a breath of fresh air that we badly need, which fo","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"In a Brooklyn School District, Greater Expectations in Math","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/nyregion/in-a-brooklyn-school-district-greater-expectations-in-math.html","abstract":"  Joyce R.

The movie, which opened today at the Film Forum, lets its images speak for themselves. It shows how the bulls used in combat are bred to be hot-tempered and aggressive. Long before they enter the ring, they are confined in pens where they are teased and prodded in order to make them more short-tempered.

His commercials focus on his efforts to pass laws to immunize children, provide family medical leaves and ban assault weapons.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"Shakespeare's Men Become Women","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/theater/theater-review-shakespeare-s-men-become-women.html","abstract":"  For her staging of \"The Tempest,\" presented free by the Kings County Shakespeare Company at 8 nightly through Sunday in the Prospect Park Band Shell in Brooklyn, Deborah Wright Houston, the director, turns King Alonso, Sebastian, Trinculo and Ariel into women; as Miranda she casts a blind actress and as Gonzalo a mute actor who delivers his speeches by signing; and she fills the stage with half a dozen \"spirits\" who, although silent, seem to take control of the action.   If the program did not mention that Maria Hansen is sightless, the audience might not notice. But the odd effect of the signing by Gonzalo (Matthew Hutton), with someone else translating his lines into speech, is to vastly inflate the role of this old wise man. That Naples has a Queen, not a King, hardly matters; and turning the drunken Stephano's sidekick into Trincula is inspired. Vicki Hirsch is very funny in this role.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"Legislators In U.S. Differ Over Haiti","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/world/legislators-in-us-differ-over-haiti.html","abstract":"  A day after the Clinton Administration issued its strongest threat to date of a military invasion of Haiti, two leading members of Congress expressed sharply divided views on using force to restore democracy there.   \"I think we're right at the point of invasion,\" said Representative Lee H.

The Overlook Press. $23.95   \"I would rather sell peanuts in Mexico than make films at Fox,\" Jean Renoir wrote, in an uncharacteristically griping mood, to his friend the screenwriter Dudley Nichols. When this great French director arrived in Hollywood at the start of World War II, he was not prepared for the way studios would cramp his brilliant, graceful style. Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, actually took over the editing of Renoir's first American film, \"Swamp Water,\" a story of love and injustice in the Georgia bogs. Yet Renoir did more than survive in Hollywood. He adopted the whole country, if not its methods of film making, and died at home in Beverly Hills in 1979, at the age of 84.    The paradox of the auteur in Hollywood is just a piece of Renoir's huge, eventful life. He was born 100 years ago, on Sept. 15, 1894, and his career spans the history of movie-making itself. His work ranged from silent films to Technicolor classics (Anna Magnani in \"The Golden Coach\") to television.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"For Football Union, A Cap Is No Big Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/sports/on-baseball-for-football-union-a-cap-is-no-big-deal.html","abstract":"  More than 750 striking major league baseball players missed their first paychecks yesterday.
