The dinosaur of segregated politics has been buried for less than three decades in the South.

The case seems a trivial one. Its immediate object is two goofily shaped districts with bare black majorities. Due to these majorities, North Carolina's 12-person House delegation now has two black members -- the first of their race elected from North Carolina since Reconstruction.

The piece seemed to melt away; Mr. Scott let the balance between the tune's form and improvisation shift, with cascades of drumming overwhelming the piece's borders. Mr. Scott, 24 and immensily gifted, seemed almost impatient with the classicism of the mainstream.   The jazz renaissance of the last decade did away with the notion of difficult music in jazz, and \"Behind the Scenes,\" which owed a bit to the more experimental side of Herbie Hancock and later Hampton Hawes (though Mr. Scott is much more referential than either of them), might have been considered abstract by an audience looking to hear the plain mainstream.

The mail -- largely targeted at constituencies like senior citizens -- was timed for maximum political benefit. Shortly before the general election, senators sent out more than two million pieces at a cost of $364,000.

The cooking style resonates nicely with the crowd faithful to the Seventh Avenue restaurant.

Despite the many civil wars in the world, the U.S. has an opportunity to mold an international system more compatible with the values we have held for two centuries. But we may be letting that chance pass through our fingers. The tremendous domestic tasks facing us call not just for our immediate attention but for continued real sacrifice.   Some say that we have carried the weight of world leadership long enough and that we no longer need to maintain a large military establishment. These attitudes are understandable but misguided. Beyond the responsibility that goes with power and the altruistic obligation most Americans feel toward their fellow man, very practical, even selfish reasons should move us.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930702","headline":"Holiday Weekend","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/02/nyregion/holiday-weekend.html","abstract":"  Independence Day will be observed on Monday.

Retirees under these other plans pay income tax on the part of their benefit that exceeds what they paid in.
