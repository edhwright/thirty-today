While generally pleased at the revival of a cause that seemed moribund, many of the leading conservative groups involved with the issue are concerned that in supporting a constitutional amendment that would fundamentally change the Bill of Rights, Mr. Gingrich may be courting the same sort of political setback that President Clinton incurred when he pushed early in his Administration to overturn the ban on homosexuals in the military. And they worry that even if successful, a school prayer effort could hand liberal groups an easy target they could use to undermine support on other issues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941119","headline":"Carjacking Murder Suspect and Cross-Examiner Icily Argue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/19/nyregion/carjacking-murder-suspect-and-cross-examiner-icily-argue.html","abstract":"  Under an intense cross-examination, Edward L.

Republicans are just like human beings, except for their demented conviction that repealing the capital-gains tax can save the world.     My Uncle Irvey was a Republican. He was a Southerner, but when Democrats ran the Catholic Al Smith for President in 1928, Uncle Irvey did not terrify neighborhood Protestants with warnings that a victorious Al Smith would move the Pope into the White House. The local Protestant Democrats did it for him.    Republicans are decent. One lent me the rent money once without asking collateral. A Republican is godmother to one of my children and has never sought to corrupt the child's faith by preaching salvation through repealing the capital-gains tax.     Republicans, in short, are not much different from people, so it is silly for Democrats to be terrified.     Think, Democrats, think. Your party has really been just a rudderless variation on the Republican party since Hubert Humphrey lost to Richard Nixon 25 years ago. After that the decline of the labor unions left it bereft of ideas, and its only Presidents have been those two old-fashioned Rockefeller Republicans: Carter and Clinton.    For evidence of the Democratic vacuum, how about that Rube Goldberg health-care bill the President offered? Republicans used to be called \"me-tooers\" because they couldn't think of much to do except go along with Democratic ideas.     Democrats are the new \"me-tooers,\" which is probably why \"me-tooers\" are now called \"new Democrats.\" President Clinton is a specimen \"new Democrat\"; that is, a Democrat who thought Eisenhower had it just about right.     You can tell \"new Democrats\" by their conviction that \"liberalism\" is their deadliest enemy and their lack of any ideas not likely to be approved by the better class of Republicans.    With Democrats now residing in the abandoned tents of the old Eisenhower Republicanism, why this Democratic panic about Republicans running Congress?     Well, it's the triumph of the Republican mossbacks of course: Gingrich, Helms, the Western right-wingers of the cowboy welfare states, all those Dixiecrats who used to be Democrats until Republicans became the white man's party. It's the same crowd that couldn't abide Nelson Rockefeller and would have chucked Eisenhower if he hadn't had such a way with the voters.    Newt Gingrich is the Republican who makes Democrats think of Walpurgis Night. With everybody talking about Gingrich's \"first hundred days,\" you might think he is the new Franklin Roosevelt risen out of Georgia to rebuild a stricken nation.    The unreality is intensified by Gingrich's announcement that he will not compromise in dealing with that lesser fellow who calls himself President. This is harmless nonsense, except that people who should know better take it seriously.    Gingrich, whose skill at mischief-making is considerable but whose talents for governance have not been tested, is doubtless blustering to cover the natural insecurity of a youngish gent in charge of a crew that hasn't sailed a ship for 40 years.    Democrats should allow the possibility that he is playing bad Captain Bligh just now, largely because he is shocked and maybe a bit scared to find himself in command.     What else explains his \"no-compromise\" declaration? It's institutionally impossible for Congress to lead. House members who desire the slightest accomplishment absolutely must compromise, and not just with Presidents, but also with Senates.    I should like to assure the Democrats that they have nothing to fear but fear-of-Newt itself, but that would mislead them. A party that doesn't stand for much has plenty to fear from one that stands for plenty, even when, as now, it looks like plenty of nothing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941119","headline":"In Performance: POP; Another Style Change, For a Major Pianist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/19/arts/in-performance-pop-another-style-change-for-a-major-pianist.html","abstract":"  Village Vanguard     Geri Allen's career has been marked by abrupt shifts in direction that have sometimes obscured her status as one of the more imposing pianists of her generation.

The report, published by a team of U.S. and Russian scientists in the current Science magazine, traces many of the victims to an area south of the plant. The obvious surmise is that the installation was manufacturing germ-warfare agents, a violation of the 1972 treaty banning biological weapons.     The findings should accelerate U.S. efforts to strengthen the 1972 ban, which was signed without verification procedures. True, small quantities of germ warfare agents can easily be concealed, making the ban difficult to verify, but larger amounts in weapon form are harder to hide.

Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki seems to be one of those times. Although there might seem to be great political benefit for both men in an instant rapprochement, the bitterness between them now is just too great, according to their aides.   In part, the ill will is being fueled by advisers to both men whose memories of a brutal campaign remain too fresh to give way to constructive compromise. On Mr. Pataki's side, many of those aides also have close ties to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who has himself fought fiercely with Mr. Giuliani for years. And in the center are two strong-willed politicians who know how to hold a grudge: Mr. Giuliani, whose quick temper and sometimes biting manner are well known, and Mr. Pataki, whose genial exterior belies a steely political will.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941119","headline":"BRIEFCASE : DWS Targets Swiss, Scandinavia Stocks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/19/your-money/IHT-briefcase-dws-targets-swiss-scandinavia-stocks.html","abstract":"DWS, the mutual fund arm of Deutsche Bank, is launching two new funds.

Perhaps it goes to show that he is better at getting votes than acquiring noblesse. Or maybe he is confused about his political cliches and thinks he is supposed to be petty, rather than gracious, in victory. Or maybe, as Mayor Giuliani said in the campaign, Mr. Pataki is not willing to meet unless one of his minders is around to report back to Alfonse D'Amato.    Whatever. The point is that Mr. Pataki's insistence on treating Rudolph Giuliani with contempt is also a sign of contempt for the city's 7.5 million citizens.

With words like \"shocking\" and statements such as, \"The more I found out the more astonished and embarrassed for my clients I was by how pandering the curriculum is,\" he was reacting to material that is necessarily explicit in order to make as clear as possible the ways in which the deadly virus that causes AIDS is transmitted.

The trade association, joined by six other food-industry and supermarket groups, has filed suit to stop the Agriculture Department from testing ground beef for E. coli bacteria that are responsible for as many as 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths a year.   The contamination occurs when a cow's intestinal or fecal matter comes into contact with muscle meat during unsanitary slaughter. Ground beef poses a special hazard because the grinding process spreads the contamination throughout the product. Proper cooking will kill the bacteria, but many people have grown used to eating their beef rare or raw. Even a supposedly well-done hamburger may not be safe because of uneven temperatures within the patty as it is cooked.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Ramapo College Speeds Up Decisions on Acceptance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/nyregion/ramapo-college-speeds-up-decisions-on-acceptance.html","abstract":"RAMAPO COLLEGE thinks it has a prescription that will cure the anxiety that commonly plagues high school seniors after they send in their college applications.

So I started writing something dumb about my intellectual development -- or was it my personal growth? -- all the time saying to myself, \"I can't, I can't,\" when suddenly out of the blue came, \"As I was having dinner last night with my first cousin once removed, Robert Lowell, the poet, I turned to him and said. . . .\"   That was a long time ago, in 1969, and it is just as well to make a clean breast of it now. Also, I might just as well admit that I do not get poetry. In high school I was good at subjects like \"The Culture of Poverty\" and \"The Negro,\" but when it came to analyzing those poets, forget it. To this day, put a gun to my head and I still cannot tell you the difference between the tone of a poem and the mood of a poem. Still, I did not lie on the application.

The three albums that he has released since March 1993 have sold nearly 250,000 copies, many times the number most jazz musicians sell in a lifetime. He tours as the leader of his own band, playing more than 250 dates a year, which at his age makes him an anomaly. And for somebody who clearly hasn't finished the maturation process that jazz requires, he has received an extraordinary amount of coverage in the mainstream news media.   Mr. Redman will appear on Dec. 2 at Town Hall. It is his biggest New York date so far and a show that moves him out of the clubs into the concert hall. He is in the process of creating a public personality that's more the province of pop stars than of jazz musicians.

But then this vastly improved Columbia team, which had surprised its most ardent supporters -- not to mention the entire Ivy League -- reverted to the inept form that had characterized Lion teams over most of the last two decades.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"At a Loss for Words With Those Who Aren't","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-at-a-loss-for-words-with-those-who-aren-t.html","abstract":"  Meeting one of his favorite authors, David Kratz was at a loss for words.   \"I was worried about what I would talk to E.

His gifts were immediately recognized by the likes of Carl Van Vechten and Frank Crowninshield, and he soon found work doing caricatures and illustrations for Vanity Fair and other leading magazines. Gallery shows, book publication and commissions for set designs followed. Rosa Roland was a celebrated dancer and choreographer when Covarrubias met her, but by the time they married in 1930, she had left the stage. A striking beauty photographed by, among others, Edward Weston and Cartier-Bresson, she became an accomplished painter, photographer and cook. In COVARRUBIAS (University of Texas, $29.95), Adriana Williams, an independent scholar, chronicles the lives and times of Miguel and Rosa Covarrubias with a veritable torrent of names, places and events. Most of the notable artists and intellectuals from the 1920's and 30's seem to have crossed their paths, either in New York, on their travels, or in Mexico City, where they moved in the mid-30's. Their wide range of friends included Al Hirschfeld, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera and John Huston. Covarrubias was fascinated by the ethnic roots of culture and eager to experience authentic forms of dance, music and art before they were lost to the leveling effect of modern life. This passion not only enriched his art -- from the Harlem drawings to his murals for San Francisco's 1938 international exposition -- but also led to books on Balinese culture and the archeology of Mexico. Ms. Williams has not worked this rich material into an authoritative biography, but the abundant information she has gathered should serve future biographers well.

The Cosmati, named for Cosma, the oldest and most active of the group, were a medieval cooperative of stonemasons and sculptors that created a dazzling inlaid marble and glass technique. For over 100 years, it captured the markets and made them the most sought-after church decorators in Italy.\n\nThe Cosmati recycled marble fragments from ancient ruins and combined them with cubes of colored glass to produce intricate geometric patterns saturated with the blood red of imperial porphyry, the dusty yellow of antique giallo and the elegant gray-green of serpentino. With these they decorated everything from cloister columns to candleholders. But it was their floors that were the talk of the medieval world, so much so that from the 12th to the 13th centuries, churches in many parts of what we now know as Italy rivaled one another in the splendor of their Cosmatesque floors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/realestate/residential-resales-853496.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

Unafraid of boring his audience with scenes in which little seems to happen, the Polish director of brooding, haunting films like \"The Double Life of Veronique\" (1991) and \"Decalogue\" (1988) deals in emotional nuance and unspoken dialogue in the increasingly marginalized tradition of Robert Bresson and Ingmar Bergman. Mr. Kieslowski continues this tradition in \"Red,\" the widely praised finale to his \"Three Colors\" trilogy, which opens in New York on Wednesday.   Meeting with a group of American journalists during the Cannes Film Festival last May, Mr. Kieslowski, 53, projected the bookish intensity of an Eastern European auteur. He sported a buzz cut (perhaps to hide an incipient baldness), glasses and a leather jacket. Though his English is serviceable, he preferred to speak in Polish, through a translator, in effect adding another protective layer. He is a director who hates talking about the meaning of his films but will happily discuss technical details at length.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Carolyn A.

Those who do not receive timely prenatal care are predominantly poor minorities at high risk of having premature and low-birth-weight babies.

AAA-AA Championship yesterday at Hofstra University. With his team trailing by 18-8 late in the third period, St. Anthony's Shawn McDonald returned a kickoff 95 yards for a score.

The Flying Karamazov Brothers, who first appeared on Broadway 11 years ago, have always made it a point to create theater from humble materials. Having started out on the streets of San Francisco, they convey the cheerfully anarchic attitude of unreconstructed hippies.
