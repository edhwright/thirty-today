The President once hoped to lift the ban on gay soldiers, thus liberating gay men and lesbians who have served their country well from fear of discovery and expulsion. But in the end he yielded to fierce opposition and simply modified the ban, ending its worst abuses but forcing homosexuals to hide their private lives if they wish to serve.   Even so, the policy moves in the right direction and is probably the best that can be wrung from a Congress that is unwilling to go further than the Joint Chiefs of Staff will accept. So on practical grounds there is little choice but to take half a loaf.

Despite the heavy toll on the expectant mother, scientists generally view pregnancy as a delicate process of cooperation between a woman and her fetus.\n\nFor the past two years, Dr. David Haig, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, has been examining pregnancy using Darwinian theory. Darwin argues that natural selection favors any gene that increases the number of offspring an organism produces. But a child shares only half of its genes with the mother; the other half comes from the father. As a result, the evolutionary interests of a mother and her offspring can be different. The fetus benefits by extracting as much nutrition as it can use from the woman. She, however, must strike a balance between nourishing the fetus and keeping resources for herself and her future children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930720","headline":"After 3 Years, Bulls Finally Sign Kukoc","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/20/sports/pro-basketball-after-3-years-bulls-finally-sign-kukoc.html","abstract":"  After three years of courting him, the Chicago Bulls finally landed Toni Kukoc yesterday, signing the 6-foot-11-inch guard known as the \"Magic Johnson of Europe\" to a multiyear contract.

Toward the close of the 20th century, the 19th century's prejudices and xenophobia remain alive in the republics of the former Soviet Union. That is the frightening message of Walter Laqueur's revealing new book, \"Black Hundred.\"    To the inchoate groups on the extreme right who are increasingly influential in the political and social life of Russia, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin are considered enemies of the state. The new nationalistic superpatriots are opposed to rapprochement with the West. Anti-Americanism is very much present in the anti-democratic language used by leaders of the extremist parties. Nostalgia for the old order includes a revival of a sect of zealots in the Russian Orthodox Church, modern-day Cossacks in czarist uniforms and virulent anti-Semitism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930721","headline":"Sons Killed Parents; Why Is Only Issue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/21/us/sons-killed-parents-why-is-only-issue.html","abstract":"  Two wealthy Beverly Hills brothers now admit that they walked into their living room almost four years ago, leveled shotguns at their parents seated in front of the television set and fired.

Analysis of Criminal Investigation    Several people were responsible for the stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum. Only Lemrick Nelson was indicted, tried and acquitted. Deficiencies in the initial investigation created problems with the evidence which subsequent efforts did not overcome. Accordingly, the likelihood that other participants in the attack on Rosenbaum will be held accountable for the murder has been greatly diminished.                    . . .         The improper handling of critical physical evidence compromised its probative value at trial. The bloodstained knife discovered on Nelson, which should have provided persuasive proof in support of the prosecution's case, was not properly handled. Additionally, Nelson's pants could have provided meaningful evidence of his involvement in the attack on Rosenbaum. The stains on the pants should have been properly noted and analyzed by the police. Tests on this evidence were not sufficiently monitored by the prosecution. The Jury's View of the Case    Considering the problems with the evidence presented by the prosecution, there was an ample basis for the jury verdict finding that the people had not proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The reasonable doubts articulated by the jurors arose, to a greater extent, from the inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony and deficiencies in the evidence.                    . . .         During the course of the interviews with the jurors, two themes emerged for why the jury determined that Nelson was not guilty. These themes can be characterized as inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony and as deficiencies in the evidence.                    . . .         The jurors found that the inconsistencies in the police officers' testimony were an overriding consideration in undermining the value of all key prosecution evidence, and in finding that Nelson was not guilty of stabbing Rosenbaum. The prosecution's late discovery of key witnesses exacerbated this problem.   Most significantly, the inconsistencies in the police officers' testimony regarding Nelson's apprehension, Rosenbaum's identification and Nelson's confession seriously compromised the value of this evidence in the eyes of the jury. The jurors had been instructed by Judge Rappaport to evaluate whether the witnesses were truthful in order to determine the facts of the case. The jurors stated that, after considering these factors, they determined that they could not reconcile the contradictory evidence and the inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses. As a result, they disregarded the testimony of some of the main police witnesses whose statements were crucial to proving Nelson's guilt.   The manner in which the Judge conducted the trial appeared to have influenced the jury's decision-making.   Although many of the jurors seemed to have a favorable view of the Judge, his remarks and conduct may have adversely affected their view about the credibility of the police witnesses. He was unable to control the conduct and the comments of the defense counsel, which afforded the jury an opportunity to consider information that was otherwise irrelevant or inadmissible. Further, by continuously interjecting himself in the questioning of witnesses, the jury had concerns regarding the Judge's impartiality. Most significantly, the Judge's reaction to Officer Lewis's testimony highlighted the inconsistencies between Lewis's version of the events surrounding Nelson's apprehension and the version of Officers Hoppe and Marinos and Detective Litwin. The Judge did not remain an impartial arbitrator and instead conveyed to the jury his personal opinions about the evidence.                    . . .       From the Findings    * The failure to record the identities of the individuals present at the scene made it difficult to identify police and civilian witnesses.   * Interviews with the victim and possible suspects were not conducted promptly or recorded.   * The improper handling of critical physical evidence compromised its probative value at trial. The bloodstained knife discovered on Nelson, which should have provided persuasive proof in support of the prosecution's case, was not properly handled. Additionally, Nelson's pants could have provided meaningful evidence of his involvement in the attack on Rosenbaum. The stains on the pants should have been properly noted and analyzed by the police. Tests on this evidence were not sufficiently monitored by the prosecution.   * The jurors found that the inconsistencies in the police officers' testimony were an overriding consideration in undermining the value of all key prosecution evidence, and in finding that Nelson was not guilty of stabbing Rosenbaum.

In a scathing portrait of ineptitude and miscommunication that extended from police deployment on the Crown Heights streets to the upper reaches of City Hall, the report also found that serious lapses by investigators, prosecutors and the presiding judge had contributed to the acquittal of a black youth in the killing of a Hasidic scholar on the first night of violence.

From Executive Summary Planning                    . . .         The department's Disorder Control Plans provided a solid basis for guiding its response to the disturbance. However, the plans were not updated annually as required, did not provide an explicit mission statement, nor make clear when they were to be invoked. These plans were not used until Thursday, when the strategy adopted mirrored the principles of the Patrol Borough Brooklyn South Unusual Disorder Plan.                    . . .       Mobilization and Tactics    The mobilization and deployment of officers to the accident scene occurred too slowly to prevent the spread of the disturbance.   Violence erupted at President Street and Utica Avenue soon after the 8:20 P.M. accident. By 9 P.M., 911 callers had reported a riot in the area and the police began to mobilize. However, at first, the response was limited to officers responding to radio calls, about 30 officers stationed at a nearby concert, and the Brooklyn South Task Force. However, 270 of the approximately 400 officers ultimately assigned did not arrive until after 11:30 P.M., and full mobilization was not completed until between 1 and 2:40 A.M.   Because of the slow pace of mobilization, the officers were not in position to control the unruly mob at the accident scene. The mob began to stream down President Street at 11 P.M., shattering windows and damaging cars. Lemrick Nelson, who was acquitted of murdering Yankel Rosenbaum, told detectives he was part of that crowd. Deployment was not completed until sometime between 1 A.M. and 2:40 A.M., at least four hours after the police saw the disturbance at the intersection of President and Utica escalate into violence.                    . . .         The officers in Crown Heights lacked a clear understanding of their mission. While the field commander initially ordered officers to exercise restraint, he was unprepared to alter their tactics when that approach failed.   Initially, Chief Gallagher emphasized restraint, fearing that aggressive action would exacerbate already strong feelings and make the police the focus of the crowd's anger. This approach failed to spell out proactive steps. Containment and dispersal were not consistently implemented, and no other tactical options were substituted.   As a result, field supervisors were forced to improvise or remain passive when restraint failed. The department's response to the first three nights of violence was, consequently, uncoordinated and ineffective.                    . . .         Prior to Thursday, most of the police were deployed to fixed posts, an ineffective way to prevent illegal activity by roving bands.   Because the police were deployed at fixed posts, roving bands were able to move through the neighborhood. These roving bands committed violent acts and moved elsewhere before the police could respond. The Police Department's failure to control roving bands contributed significantly to the riotous character of the disturbance.   On Thursday, the department supplemented its fixed-post strategy with mobile patrols assigned to cover these roving bands. Exhibiting a high degree of coordination, the police ordered these bands to disperse when they became unruly and to arrest people who refused to comply. This approach was successful.   N.Y.P.D. undertook extensive community intervention efforts to mediate hostilities and to thwart rumors contributing to the unrest in Crown Heights.   Community intervention was a significant aspect of the Police Department's response to the Crown Heights disturbance. Several rumors spread throughout the community shortly after the fatal accident. They helped to fuel the anger and deepen the division between blacks and Hasidim. The police repeatedly attempted to dispel the rumors through public meetings and press conferences.   Efforts were made at all levels, from Police Commissioner to the borough commander to community affairs officers, to communicate with the black and Hasidic communities, starting Monday evening. Commissioner Brown, the Mayor and Deputy Mayors and leaders of the community quickly gathered that night at the 71st Precinct. They saw the need to work together to try to calm the situation. Brown requested that community leaders be briefed to help them quell rumors and encourage public order.                    . . .       Command and Control    There was no evidence of an affirmative order by the Police Commissioner to prevent the police from responding to criminal incidents in Crown Heights.   The Police Commissioner and other members of the command structure stated that at no time did they order officers not to make arrests. Commissioner Brown stated: \"I know there was no policy from my level, and I haven't heard anyone below me say that they may have ordered a no-arrest policy.\" Assistant Chief Gallagher, Deputy Chief Gussman and other commanding officers echoed this contention.   Commissioner Brown said his expectation was that arrests would be made for violations of the law where the police were capable of doing so. Assistant Chief Gallagher said police officers were instructed not to take independent action and to stay on their posts to protect the assigned areas. The assignment of most officers to fixed posts and the relative absence of mobile patrols, however, made it more difficult to effectuate arrests.   Personnel changes within the department in early August 1991 placed two key officials in positions and weakened the command structure.   Effective Aug. 15, 1991, the chief of department, Robert Johnston, retired. On Monday, August 19, the new chief of department, David W. Scott, went on a previously scheduled vacation. Chief of detectives, Joseph Borrelli, was named to assume interim duties as acting chief of department. Mario Selvaggi was appointed that day to be chief of patrol. With Selvaggi and Borrelli serving in less than familiar roles, the command structure was weakened. They were inclined to accept the information and plans they received rather than adopting more assertive roles.   A collective failure by top-ranking N.Y.P.D. officials delayed the implementation of appropriate tactics to control this disorder.   Many of our criticisms of the police response to the disturbances are negative judgments about the performance of high-level N.Y.P.D. officials. The Police Department clearly had sufficient resources and knowhow to deal more swiftly and effectively with the disturbance. The individuals who occupied the highest positions in the department must share accountability for its failure to do so before Thursday.   Effective supervision requires that the headquarters command staff insist upon the development of sound tactical objectives, monitor the actions taken by the field commander and judge the effectiveness of those efforts. Commissioner Brown and others should have intervened when a change in tactics was warranted. Instead, the department's oversight of field operations was inadequate.                    . . .         The Police Commissioner did not effectively fulfill his ultimate responsibility for managing the department's activities to suppress rioting and preserve the public peace.   The Police Commissioner's fundamental responsibility is to manage the department to meet the public need for police services. Brown asserted that his job was to make sure that his uniformed commanders had the support they needed. He said the decision how to use the police officers, once they were on the scene, was to be made by those in the field. The Commissioner, himself, told us that he thought the commanders handling the situation had sufficient experience and knew what to do. He considered it the responsibility of his staff to identify problems of resources or tactics and bring them to his attention. He did not closely oversee the police response to the disturbance.   In times of emergency, the public can reasonably expect the Police Commissioner to ask probing questions of key aides on the scene, as well as monitor ongoing developments. The Commissioner should assess operational effectiveness and demand changes where needed. There is no evidence that Lee P. Brown provided this kind of leadership during the first three days of disturbances in Crown Heights. Evaluated against these standards, the Commissioner's leadership and performance were inadequate.   Given the seriousness of the disturbances, it is unfortunate that the First Deputy did not assume a role in coordinating the development and implementation of a different strategy sooner.   As an executive aide to the Commissioner, First Deputy Raymond Kelly was assigned various administrative functions. In an interview, now-Commissioner Kelly said it was made clear to him following his appointment that he was to have no role in operations and that the chief of department would report directly to the Commissioner.   Kelly had the authority to intervene in emergency incidents according to the Patrol Guide procedures. However, because he was not formally in the direct chain of command, Kelly had no responsibility for patrol services. Watching events on television Wednesday, Kelly decided on his own initiative to go to Crown Heights. After meeting with Commissioner Brown, a decision was made that tactical changes were needed. Kelly assumed responsibility for devising the new strategy that ultimately restored calm to the area.    It proved to be a critical shortcoming that Commissioner Brown did not call upon Kelly to assume his ultimate role in coordinating the development and implementation of a new strategy. It is regrettable that, under the circumstances, Kelly did not deem it appropriate to seek an active role prior to late Wednesday.                    . . .         Gaps in communication blocked the flow of critical information through the chain of command.  When asked who would have been reporting directly to him about what was going on in Crown Heights, Brown stated that it was Acting Chief of Department Borrelli. Brown said that he received information from whoever had it during the disturbance, but viewed Borrelli as \"the person there who was in charge of everything.\" However, Chief Borrelli said he had little contact with the Commissioner, except for conversations regarding the Rosenbaum homicide and their mutual presence at meetings with the Mayor.   It appears Brown did not receive a comprehensive account of the events on the streets, nor of the tactics used. For instance, when we spoke with him, the former Commissioner was unaware that on Tuesday Chief Gallagher had ordered his officers to take cover for their safety along the building line because they were outnumbered when crowds began throwing rocks and bottles. When we informed Brown about this crucial incident, he agreed that based upon this information, unknown to him at the time, it would have been appropriate for those at the scene to request reinforcements or devise new tactics.                    . . .       911    During the disturbance, Crown Heights residents relied on the 911 system to alert the police to imminent danger. Callers reported attacks on their homes, unruly mobs on the street and assaults in progress. Many of these callers were not well served by the system.   Many 911 calls reporting large bands of angry demonstrators threatening or engaging in property and personal offenses were erroneously incident-coded as \"disorderly group\" or \"criminal mischief.\" Consequently, they were handled as low priority calls.   When a call is made to the 911 system, the operator classifies the reported incident. This generates a priority level, which influences the speed with which the police respond. In many cases, calls reporting large angry bands of people were incorrectly coded as \"disorderly groups,\" or \"criminal mischief.\" These calls receive a relatively low priority rating. A more appropriate classification would have been \"roving band,\" which receives a high priority classification. Despite intense roving band activity, just two calls received that classification.   The erroneous classification of 911 jobs as duplicates denied police services to some callers.   Many calls were also classified as duplicates even though they reported incidents at different locations. This violated departmental guidelines, which require that calls specify the exact same incident in order to be considered duplicated. The heavy use of duplicate classifications prevented some calls from receiving a police response.                    . . .       From the Findings    * The mobilization and deployment of officers to the accident scene occurred too slowly after violence began to limit the spread of the disorder that night.   * The Police Department lacked a clearly defined and articulated mission to guide its response to civil disturbances. The field commander chose a restraint-oriented approach, but failed to direct proactive measures to end the violence.   * Until a proactive-arrest policy was announced and the unlawful assembly statute was used, the police did not effectively prevent disorderly crowds from forming and engaging in acts of violence.   * N.Y.P.D. undertook extensive community intervention efforts to mediate hostilities and to thwart rumors which had contributed to the unrest in Crown Heights.   * There was no evidence of an affirmative order by the Police Commissioner to prevent the police from responding to criminal incidents in Crown Heights.   * A collective failure by top-ranking N.Y.P.D. officials delayed the implementation of appropriate tactics to control the disorder.   * The Police Commissioner did not effectively fulfill his ultimate responsibility for managing the department's activities to suppress rioting and preserve the public peace.   * Gaps in communication blocked the flow of critical information through the chain of command.   * Many 911 calls reporting large bands of angry demonstrators threatening or engaged in property and personal offenses were erroneously incident-coded as \"disorderly group\" or \"criminal mischief.\" Consequently, they were handled as low-priority calls.   * The erroneous classification of 911 jobs as duplicates denied police services to some callers.   * The N.Y.P.D. has made significant improvement since August of 1991 to enhance its planning and training for future disturbances.

While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing. When not standing still, she either paces back and forth across the stage or sits on a stool. She doesn't tell jokes. When she talks, her patter has the clunky ring of predigested interview responses.    What largely makes up for the dearth of entertainment values in Ms. Houston's shows is a voice made of steel and smoke that can send chills through an audience. And at Tuesday's opening-night performance of a Radio City Music Hall engagement that extends through Monday, that voice rang magnificently through the auditorium.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930722","headline":"Swedish Conductor Joins Manhattan School","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/22/arts/swedish-conductor-joins-manhattan-school.html","abstract":"  The Swedish conductor Sixten Ehrling has been appointed chief conductor and musical adviser to the three orchestras at the Manhattan School of Music, the school's president, Marta Istomin, has announced.

In his worst outing of the season, Key stumbled in the eighth inning after the Yankees had erased a 3-1 deficit in the seventh, then Steve Farr compounded the sloppy affair by giving up two home runs and verifying the growing reputation of the bumbling bullpen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930722","headline":"Man Facing Eviction Attacks 2 in Family, Then Kills Himself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/22/nyregion/man-facing-eviction-attacks-2-in-family-then-kills-himself.html","abstract":"  On the brink of eviction from his home in Rumson, N.J., a 56-year-old man used a shotgun to shoot his mother and to fracture the skull of his daughter yesterday before shooting himself, the police said.

Elliott's agent, Marvin Demoff, had thus far been silent throughout his client's absence. Elliott has been silent, too. But today Demoff spoke out.

The criticisms voiced by Rome, after three of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by followers of Gen.
