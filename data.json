Along shorelines, houses washed away. Inland, residents tried to dig out from snowfalls that ranged from 6 to 30 inches. Thousands lost power. Thousands more were stranded or delayed at airports, bus terminals and train stations.   It could have been worse, officials throughout the metropolitan region agreed. But the storm had its killing side -- a motorist buried under an avalanche; a firefighter killed when an oxygen tank exploded; a woman run over by a car; men collapsing while shoveling snow.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930315","headline":"Baseball Gold Still Eludes Jim Crow's Victims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/sports/baseball-baseball-gold-still-eludes-jim-crow-s-victims.html","abstract":"  Players from baseball's old Negro Leagues, barred for decades from the major leagues and then largely forgotten as their achievements faded into the past, are enjoying a revival of interest linked to the boom in baseball memorabilia.

For many of the former Negro Leaguers -- men in their 70's, 80's and 90's, some poor, some sick, some forgiving, some sensitized by old racial abuses -- the potential revenue from this licensing effort could provide much needed help for things such as rent, medical bills, food and even funeral expenses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930315","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-90981356492.html","abstract":"1943: 'Servant of France'","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930315","headline":"A Temporary TKTS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/theater/a-temporary-tkts.html","abstract":"  The lower Manhattan TKTS booth, the reduced-price theater-ticket outlet that was closed after the explosion at the World Trade Center, is to reopen today in temporary quarters at the Manhattan Savings Bank at 4 World Trade Center, at the corner of Liberty and Church Streets.

It halted Bobby Bonilla in his tracks in right field, cleared the outfield fence, kept going right on over the plateau of ground beyond. Darryl Strawberry, months after back surgery, is healthy, dangerous and, of course, eminently quotable.   \"Has anyone asked, and can the Mets ever explain, how they could get rid of all the talent they had?\" asked Strawberry. \"The fans in New York know their baseball. I'm sure they are asking what happened to their players.\"   The players Strawberry was talking about, of course, have gone a lot of places -- into retirement, to free agency, off to other clubs in trades of debatable merit. Others have come in, and the results have not been special. The Mets, who declined to bid seriously for Strawberry after the 1990 season, have finished fifth twice since Strawberry left, and the giant contracts they have handed out to others have generated scarcely any dividends to date.   \"I don't even know who they are,\" Strawberry said of the Mets. 'New York's a Hard Town'    The club's anonymity for Strawberry is not total. He doesn't need to be reminded that Vince Coleman is there, a base-stealer signed for nearly as much as the Mets offered Strawberry. He knows full well Bobby Bonilla is in New York, under siege and all over the headlines.   \"New York's a hard town,\" said Strawberry. \"I think people, over time, have realized how tough I was.\"   He was updated on the details of Bonilla's most recent difficult week. His reaction mixed understanding and advice. It was not, however, exactly suffused with sympathy.   \"You put your hand in the fire, and that's what you are going to have to deal with,\" said Strawberry. \"He's in a fireplace. And he's making big money. They want you to put the club on your back and carry it.\"   Asked if Bonilla were up to the load, Strawberry, who bears Bonilla no personal animus, hedged.   \"You can't judge what kind of player he is,\" Strawberry said of the Mets' current right fielder. \"When the pressure is on, you have to rise above it. And I'm quite sure he's feeling a lot of pressure.\" He Has Heard That Before    He was told of Bonilla's being booed here in spring-training games.   \"It's a town that can make you or break you,\" said Strawberry. \"Hey, they booed me in spring, too. He got the big contract, I didn't. He has to learn to accept the boos.\"   Bonilla's strategy, said Strawberry, should not be to look to escape, but to, by force of will and talent, reverse it all.   \"The way you answer it is put the fans on their feet,\" said Strawberry. \"I didn't run and hide.

He has made an extensive series of disks for London Records, including a superb Nielsen symphony cycle, some fine Sibelius recordings and some solid standard-repertory recordings, including a \"Carmina Burana\" that won a Grammy this year.    He has also tightened the ensemble's sound over the years, at least in certain repertory, and he has made San Francisco's aspirations to be counted among the best American orchestras seem plausible, depending on how long a list one is willing to make. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Blomstedt led his musicians through a program divided between splashy works and introspective ones, and he showed how far the orchestra has come and how much ground is left to conquer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930315","headline":"Review/Dance; Some Canadian Visitors Are in Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/arts/review-dance-some-canadian-visitors-are-in-town.html","abstract":"  The Alberta Ballet is probably best known for its director, Ali Pourfarrokh, who performed with three major New York ballet companies and with Alvin Ailey, and for its reputation for producing engaging dancers.

Poseidon Press. $19.     It's hard not to compare \"The Law of Falling Bodies,\" Jill Ciment's radiant first novel, with Mona Simpson's \"Anywhere but Here\" (1986). Both novels feature impossible, eccentric mothers, who are blinded by the glitter of their own fickle dreams, and their conflicted daughters, torn between filial devotion and a desperate need to make independent lives of their own. Both take place on the road to and in California. And both mark the debuts of writers blessed with an uncommon gift for language.   \"Falling Bodies\" isn't as ambitious a book as \"Anywhere but Here\": it doesn't tackle a whole slice of contemporary history or attempt to reinvent traditional literary myths, as Ms. Simpson's remarkable novel did. Instead, Ms. Ciment (pronounced sih-MENT) contents herself with telling the whimsical story of a single mother and daughter. Yet in fulfilling her modest aims, the book completely beguiles the reader. It is sad, funny and affecting, completely assured in its portrayal of the complicated mathematics of family emotions: one of those novels you want to mail to friends.   Told in first person, \"Falling Bodies\" is the story of Kimberly and her efforts to come to terms with her mother, Gloria. Gloria Gail -- the name seems meant to recall Dorothy Gael, who crossed the rainbow to Oz -- is one of those inveterate dreamers, who's convinced that a gold mine lies just beyond the horizon, that a jackpot has just eluded her reach. She's a kind of female Gatsby, someone eerily attuned to the romantic possibilities of life.   \"My mother didn't care about a bigger house or a swimming pool,\" Kim recalls. \"Possessions, in point of fact, held no interest whatsoever for her. What my mother was after, had always been after, was something outside of material gain, something that rendered the big house empty, the pool drained of meaning. I'd seen my mother standing in front of a gumball machine with prizes, as transfixed by the plastic jewelry, squirt guns and jawbreakers as Cortes was by the Aztecs' gold. Obviously, at 44 years old, it was inconsequential to her what the machine would expel, a tutti-frutti sucker or a brass ring. Yet each time she dropped another copper penny into the slot, her breath caught.\" She lived, dreamed and breathed \"for those exalted moments between the promise and the prize.\"    Charming, compulsive and almost endlessly hopeful, Gloria spends her days and nights drinking coffee and dreaming up schemes that run the gamut from insurance scams to pyramid games to the marketing of bizarre new products. Though she has sold Geiger counters, weight-loss potions and treadmills for pets, Gloria's specialty is an aphrodisiac perfume. For years now, she has driven from town to town in California and Nevada, selling vials of this magic elixir from her car trunk, and she has dragged her daughter with her. By the time Kim is 15, she has attended 12 elementary schools and two junior highs. She has lived in 13 trailer parks and driven over 90,000 miles. She hopes that when the numbers on the car's odometer reach zero again, \"our lives could begin anew.\"    Fate intervenes in the shape of a 40-something widower, a kind, patient man named Arthur, who one day drives smack into Kim and Gloria's trailer. Gloria refuses to go to a hospital -- she's wanted for mail fraud and is scared of talking to the police -- and Arthur sheepishly allows her and Kim to recuperate in his house.   Much to everyone's surprise, the three soon settle into a comfortable domestic routine. Kim feels she has finally found a home. Arthur feels he has finally found a family. And Gloria, well, Gloria feels she can still come up with an idea that will bring her hope and glory.   As the weeks and months pass, however, Kim begins to fall in love with Arthur. Though she knows her mother has already shared Arthur's bed, she makes a clumsy, girlish effort to seduce him. The following day, Arthur abruptly disappears, leaving Kim and Gloria his house. By the end of the summer, they realize he is not coming back.   Kim eventually goes off to college, gets a job and tries to begin a new life. She's tired of her mother's delusions, her self-absorption, her relentless scheming. Gloria, meanwhile, resumes her itinerant life as a peddler of perfume. Her ambition now is to become a guest on the new \"What's My Line\" television show. She dreams of stumping the panel and becoming a cult figure, a kind of Lucille Ball.   Improbably enough, Kim meets Arthur again, and quits her job to move in with him. It is only when her mother suddenly resurfaces, desperate, needy and finally, it seems, willing to abandon her dreams, that Kim realizes she cannot escape her past, that she may very well have to choose between her mother and her new bourgeois life with Arthur.   In summary, such events may feel cartoonish and contrived, but as related by Ms. Ciment, they take on a palpable weight of emotion. There is a sweetness, as well as an acerbic humor, to her writing, and these qualities burnish the story of Gloria and Kim with a warm, affectionate glow.   Certainly, \"Falling Bodies\" suffers from a number of mistakes common to first novels, most notably a tendency on Ms. Ciment's part to let her narrator recount events and emotions she could not possibly know. Such stumbles, however, never detract from the pleasures of this keenly observed and beautifully written novel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"A Bad Retreat, in the Air","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/opinion/a-bad-retreat-in-the-air.html","abstract":"  It's easy to see why the Clinton Administration decided to allow a partial merger of British Airways and USAir: The agreement will help financially shaky USAir become a worthier competitor to American, United and Delta.

In recent years, the preponderance of expert opinion has shifted toward the lungfish as the closest relative of the tetrapods, a group that includes amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including ourselves.

The weekend storm -- a white hurricane that dropped mountainous snows from Florida to Canada, disrupted millions of lives and was one of the century's most powerful blows -- killed at least 168 people, making it the nation's most deadly storm since 1950, when 250 died in an East Coast blizzard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"Islanders Hope Road Remains Friendly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/sports/hockey-islanders-hope-road-remains-friendly.html","abstract":"  Maybe road is where the heart is, or at least where success is for the Islanders.

This was the last of four Bullets games played in Baltimore this season, and Washington's only victory. Harvey Grant's 15-foot jumper with 1 minute 4 seconds left in the game gave Washington the lead for good.   Cleveland shot 64 percent from the field in the first half and took a 58-46 halftime lead. In the second half, the Cavaliers slipped to 44 percent, scoring only 19 points in the fourth quarter.   \"We sat around for three days, and we just came out not sharp, and we did not have any enthusiasm,\" said Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens. \"We did not play well as far as I was concerned.\"   In the Central Division race, Cleveland dropped to two and a half games behind first-place Chicago.   In the fourth quarter, the lead changed hands seven times before Washington scored 10 straight points to take a 99-90 lead with 4:21 left. Cleveland then went on a 9-0 run and tied the game at 101-101 on a basket by John Battle with 2:14 remaining.   Grant hit his go-ahead jumper a minute later.   Tom Gugliotta led Washington with 23 points and 10 rebounds, while Grant added 21 points and LaBradford Smith 20.   Brad Daugherty led the Cavaliers with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Bulls 101, Clippers 94    Because of double-teaming on Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, B. J. Armstrong took charge and scored a career-high 28 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, as Chicago won at home.   Pippen also finished strongly, scoring 11 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Jordan had 23.   After a layup by Stanley Roberts with 2:56 left cut Chicago's lead to 91-90, Pippen countered with a 3-point field goal. Armstrong scored the Bulls' last 7 points -- with a 3-pointer and four free throws. Heat 103, Nuggets 100    Glen Rice scored 30 points, hitting two key 3-pointers in overtime, as Miami rallied from a 7-point deficit in the extra period to win in Denver.   It was the Heat's ninth victory in the last 10 games.   A pair of free throws by Bryant Stith, a 16-foot jumper by Tom Hammonds and a 3-point play by Robert Pack put Denver ahead by 98-91 with 3:25 left in overtime.   But Grant Long hit a pair of free throws, Rice connected on a 3-pointer and Bimbo Coles hit a 14-foot jumper to tie the score at 98-98. After a Denver turnover, Rice hit another 3-pointer with 1:32 left to put the Heat ahead to stay.   Jackson's 22-foot jumper with 1:15 left accounted for Denver's last points. Smith hit a pair of free throws for the Heat with 11.6 seconds remaining, and Stith and Reggie Williams both missed 3-pointers before time expired.   Denver's Dikembe Mutombo had a career-high 23 rebounds but only 8 points. Lakers 92, Spurs 87    James Worthy scored 24 points and Vlade Divac and Byron Scott added 17 each as Los Angeles defeated the Spurs for the Lakers' second victory in San Antonio this season.   Los Angeles, which played three games in four days, finished a five-game road trip at 3-2.   David Robinson led the Spurs with 26 points as San Antonio lost for just the sixth time at home. But the center was held to just 4 first-half points, and San Antonio's power-forward tandem of J. R. Reid and Antoine Carr combined for only 13 points all night.   The Lakers led by 76-71 with five minutes to play when Anthony Peeler hit a 3-point shot and Divac followed with a free throw to put San Antonio 9 points behind.   San Antonio Coach John Lucas, 28-11 since replacing Jerry Tarkanian, attributed the loss to the 23 turnovers. Sean Elliott had 17 points but 7 turnovers.   Lakers center Benoit Benjamin was ejected with 9:16 left in the game for flagrantly fouling Sean Elliott on a drive to the basket. Jazz 109, Mavericks 96    Karl Malone rebounded from one of his poorest performances of the season by scoring 36 points, and Utah won in Dallas to extend the Mavericks' club-record losing streak to 19 games.   The Mavericks have lost the 19 games by an average margin of 20 points.   If Dallas loses to visiting Orlando tomorrow, it will tie the league record for consecutive defeats in a season, held by the 1972-73 76ers.   Malone scored 15 points before being ejected in the fourth quarter of a 104-95 loss to Houston on Saturday. Against Dallas, he hit 12 of 17 field-goal attempts and 12 of 13 free throws, and added 8 rebounds.   With next season's coach, Quinn Buckner, in attendance, the Mavericks turned in a rare competitive first half, trailing by just 49-44 at intermission. Utah broke the game open in the third quarter, using a 21-8 run over the first 6:27 to build a 70-52 lead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"Hwang Play Closes After 8 Previews","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/theater/hwang-play-closes-after-8-previews.html","abstract":"  \"Face Value,\" the troubled $2 million farce by David Henry Hwang that was to open on Broadway on Sunday, has closed after eight previews at the Cort Theater.
