For instance, this summer the men's shirt is back, with shirttails flapping out over the trousers -- an idea that is not very new except for the attitude of those who are wearing it. Only last year, grunge dictated that the shirt should be worn with the sleeves tied around the waist. Now, the shirt is often wrinkled, a look that suggests anti-designer, but that doesn't mean it is not a studied style. It's the uniform worn by models on their way to work at the high-fashion designer men's wear shows (far left, far right and the three men at top). The look is being picked up by fashion followers, some of whom are adding diminutive vests.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Midnight in Dozza","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/travel/l-midnight-in-dozza-039837.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: James Sturz's article \"Wall-to-Wall Art in Dozza\" (Aug. 14) was a wonderful 44th birthday present: Dozza was the last stop on my most memorable trip to Italy.   In October 1992, my sister Linda and I toured off-the-beaten-track Italy by car. I wanted to show why I visited Italy year after year. Avoiding the main tourist sites (she could always return and see them on her own) we set out for the more remote Italy: Viterbo instead of Rome, Herculaneum instead of Pompeii, Alberobello instead of Bari. Having lingered too long at almost every stop, we had to cancel plans to visit Dozza and Ferrara and head straight for Bologna, our departure city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Michelle Greszes, David Gershbaum","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/style/weddings-michelle-greszes-david-gershbaum.html","abstract":"  Michelle Greszes, a daughter of Sarita and Ben Greszes of Great Neck, L.I., is to be married today to David Gershbaum, a son of Hilda R.

Provincetown -- the fist at the end of Cape Cod's arm, as Thoreau described it in his book \"Cape Cod\" -- is no exception. For more than 300 years renegades have taken refuge in this open-air theater of sea and Mediterranean light, from utopian Pilgrims to 17th century gamblers and smugglers; from 19th century Portuguese whalers who jumped ship to 20th-century anarchists, artists and writers; from small-business owners to a community of lesbians and gay men flying the rainbow flag.\n\nToday these overlapping legacies make Provincetown a cosmopolitan village set in natural splendor, where each person can seek a personal utopia. Old fishing shacks now front large panes of glass, catching some artist's dream of light. Cockscomb, day lilies, giant sunflowers and more flamboyant species seem to explode from every patch of ground or window ledge. Same-sex couples hold hands as they stroll, enjoying an annual week of freedom. Bicycles weave and park everywhere, defying the harried cars. The very soil is cosmopolitan, having arrived once as ballast in trading ships from such places as Plymouth, New Orleans and Spain.  Behind it all is a panorama of bay light and iridescent dunes. It is no wonder that many people consider Provincetown their home at the end of the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"ART;\nMeaning and Context Are Unimportant Except in Landscapes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/nyregion/art-meaning-and-context-are-unimportant-except-in-landscapes.html","abstract":"David Salle \n\nGuild Hall Museum, 158 Main Street, East Hampton.

Would-be visitors to Myanmar, however, will have several tour possibilities to choose from this fall.   From Oct. 27 to Nov. 12, Wings of the World will conduct a tour into the remote bamboo-teak forests of northern Myanmar. Russell Ciochon, a paleoanthropologist who was involved in primate research in Burma in the late 70's, will lead this expedition to the hill-tribe village of Mogaung. Joining the group will be a geologist, Patricia Holroyd of the United States Geological Survey, and Alan Hall, an expert on Southeast Asia's bird life. Activities will include six days of excavating and collecting fossils, bird-watching and hiking around Mogaung. Time will also be spent in the ancient cities of Mandalay and Pagan and in the capital of Yangon (formerly Rangoon). The $6,295 price includes round-trip air fare from San Francisco, Los Angeles or Seattle, lodging, local transportation and meals. In Mogaung village, accommodation will be in shelters built especially for the group.

Yet we have been deeply ambivalent about the pursuit of goods and services. Our prophets have long railed against unabashed consumerism. Philosophical ambivalence is now being joined by ecological misgivings over the processes and products of consumption that pollute. The idea of overconsumption is the result, and the idea is being taken up by major institutions.\n\nAn immediate spur to action is the International Conference on Population and Development, to be held in Cairo from Sept. 5 to 13. Consumption by the world's wealthier countries is expected to be a major focus. Consumption is linked to population by a bit of elementary algebra: population times consumption per capita equals environmental impact. An unwritten compact is in place for Cairo -- the rich countries can talk about overpopulation as long as the poor countries can dwell on overconsumption.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Sandra Cook, Marc A.

Is crime serious in your neighborhood? A.  It's getting worse here, definitely. Cars are broken into and stolen on a daily basis. When school lets out, kids come around terrorizing people on the streets, just nasty. I'm constantly chasing shoplifters out of the store. Once we caught a team of purse snatchers right out here on the corner. Q.  Have you been a victim? A.  I was robbed here last year at Christmas time, and a sales clerk was killed. It was a bad situation. Q.  Has crime affected how you live? A.  It's changed me. I'm definitely more aware. I'm looking to buy a new car, and I'm thinking what models do they they steal the fastest. I have a gun permit now. I applied after the robbery.  Q.  What about the proposed private security force?  A.  In theory it sounds good, but when it comes to extra taxes, if I spend money I can hire my own. I'd have to see the details. THE RESIDENT    Sally Kuhn: Art historian, writer and an Upper East Side resident for 25 years. Lives on 77th Street. Q.  Is crime serious in your neighborhood? A.  I would say it's a moderate issue. There's certainly been an increase over the years. Q.  Have you ever been a victim? A.  A mugging, about 15 years ago. Q.  Does concern about crime affect the way you live? A.  Definitely. I take extra precautions and live very defensively. I'm careful how I travel, carrying my keys in a place different from my money and trying to look strong and alert. The type of apartment I've chosen to live in, with a 24-hour doorman, is definitely because of these issues. Q.  What about the proposed tax to pay for private security? A.  Would we become a gilded ghetto, a gated community with no gate? Initially my reaction is: No more taxes. Don't raise the expense so that everybody will leave town, and there's nobody left to guard. THE COMMANDER    Capt. George Kelly, newly installed commander of the 19th Precinct Q.  How serious is crime on the Upper East Side? A.  Crime is taking a dramatic downturn compared to last year in just about every category. It was the same thing last year and the previous year. I believe this is a relatively safe precinct but we do have our share of crime.  Q.  Do Upper East Siders have exaggerated fears? A.  It's certainly not an exaggerated concern. Safety has become the No. 1 issue throughout the country, and the East Side is no different. Q.  What's your experience with private security officers? A.  In my old precinct in Queens, the Lindenwood Village Association has had a patrol around the clock for three years, and it has contributed to a reduction in crime and the perception of crime. Q.  What about the proposed security force for the Upper East Side? A.  I would be all for anything that would reduce crime, but it's really up to the community to decide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Letters Are Acts of Faith","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/books/l-letters-are-acts-of-faith-069965.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Vivian Gornick might be pleased to know that the epistolary reflex is activated when the kids go away to camp and school.

It's a green, tidy, languorous seaside village, where day lilies and hydrangea bushes cluster beside every other front door; where the church steeples are white, the sky shines bright blue and the salt spray roses seem always in bloom. Yet with its watery salt marshes, hidden ponds and miles of wild, sandy coastline, Wellfleet is far more elemental, certainly more moody, than anything painted by Norman Rockwell. Instead, it looks like a place re-membered from childhood, one of those places that seemed larger than it really was, and both welcoming and mysterious.   Adding to Wellfleet's miragelike effect is its literal precariousness. According to some predictions, at the current erosion rate the outermost third of Cape Cod -- which includes Provincetown, Wellfleet and Truro -- could disappear in a couple of thousand years. \"The edge of the sea is a strange and beautiful place,\" wrote Rachel Carson, adding that \"always it remains an elusive and indefinable boundary.\" And perhaps nowhere is the shore more strangely beautiful, or its boundaries more elusively indefinable, than this crook of land 75 miles out to sea, with the Atlantic Ocean battering one side and Cape Cod Bay sifting away the other.

Of course, Indians like the Musqueam people settled along the Pacific coast of British Columbia centuries before Spanish and English explorers arrived in the late 1700's; but the city didn't really start to take shape until about 1870, when a handful of merchants and saloon keepers (among them, Vancouver's favorite son, known as Gassy Jack Deighton) started selling supplies and whisky to lumbermen in Gastown, the neighborhood just east of the current city center.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Editorial Notebook; Posturing Over Baseball's Pie","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/opinion/editorial-notebook-posturing-over-baseball-s-pie.html","abstract":"  I don't care if the baseball strike ends tomorrow or next year.

To an economist, the public posturing and much of the commentary seem silly.   Ballplayers are attacked as obscenely greedy; the owners are accused of guile and mercenary calculation. The accusations seem largely beside any interesting point. The game throws off huge profits -- far more than what the players could earn doing anything else with their lives and what most of the owners require to remain in business. As in any sector where large profits are at stake, labor and management fight over the spoils.

But then, the big screen has always been educational, often in ways the film makers never particularly intended. For children willing to sit still at the movies this summer, there have been lessons galore, many of them about human relations, values and the American family. Here are a few of them. The only good mom is a dead mom.   In \"Corrina, Corrina,\" a mother has died recently and suddenly (we don't know just how) and the daughter's grief is intense. One of the teen-age boys in \"Milk Money,\" which opens on Wednesday, never knew his mother at all (she died at his birth).  Both mothers favored 1950's-style fashions (floral prints and orange polka dot sundresses), which is natural enough for the mother in \"Corrina, Corrina,\" since it is the 50's but odd for the mother who died in the 80's (even if she did remind her husband of Grace Kelly). Maybe the subliminal point is that the last time there were really good mothers was 40 years ago. In \"Lassie\" and \"Angels in the Outfield,\" the mothers are also long departed. Living mothers don't fare quite as well. The mother (and to be fair, the father) in \"North\" are bad enough to make their child consider divorce. They manage to squabble with each other throughout one dinner without even acknowledging little North's presence at the table. Nannies are more loving than parents, but they don't really count.   The mother in \"Baby's Day Out\" doesn't even know what her infant's favorite picture book is; she has to get that information from the nanny. (Although the baby is preverbal, he indicates his preference with sounds and the nanny, clearly sick of this one selection, says to him, \"Couldn't we read another book?\") After the baby escapes from his kidnappers, it's the nanny who knows him well enough to figure out where he has now crawled to. Ditto for Whoopi Goldberg, playing the nanny in \"Corrina, Corrina,\" who rescues her young charge from grief-related mutism. But there is an equally relevant message: you can love your nanny just so much and no more. Molly is hooted at by her peers at school. \"What a dodo!\" one shrieks when Molly presents the family portrait she has drawn. \"She drew her maid instead of her mommy.\" Most dads are psychologically absent -- or worse.   The best father of all is Mufasa in \"The Lion King,\" but maybe that's because he is fated to die. Living fathers ignore you, a la \"North.\" The biker father in \"Angels\" gives his child up for adoption. The businessman dad in \"Baby's Day Out\" can't remember to say goodbye to his son without repeated prodding, and he doesn't hold the child once during the entire movie. The wetlands-preservation-advocate widower father in \"Milk Money\" -- an otherwise nice guy -- is willing to go to jail for his principles but doesn't seem to have considered who will take care of his son while he's there.   Meanwhile, with the exception of the earnest father, who has remarried and moved to the farm since his first wife's death, in \"Lassie,\" not a dad in sight can deal with grief. Could it be that dads are just big children? The father in \"Andre\" calls his wife \"the only real grown-up\" in the family. With only good dead mothers and flawed fathers in sight, maybe kids are learning that they have to be as independently invincible as Baby Bink and the Little Rascals. Animals are a child's best friend, and not a bad parent substitute.   The best parent in a summer movie may have been Lassie. She helps her boy mourn his dead mother, stop moping around the house and start a sheep business. Eventually she saves his life. A close second is the gorilla in \"Baby's Day Out,\" who does more than any other human (even the nanny) to protect the baby from the bad guys. Milo, the dog in \"The Mask,\" steals the key that gets Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) out of jail. Petey, the dog in \"The Little Rascals,\" is just one of the gang. Andre the seal dances, paints and plays dress-up; he does, however, watch entirely too much television. Rich is bad.   When Fred Flintstone gets a big promotion and a raise in \"The Flintstones,\" he treats his best friend, Barney Rubble (who is actually responsible for Fred's new success), badly. At a cookout, when the family's pet dinosaur grabs Barney's steak from the grill, Fred makes no effort to replace or retrieve it. He just says, \"You'll have to fight Dino for your dinner.\" Waldo in \"The Little Rascals\" is born rich, so he never had any friends in the first place. The rich people in \"Black Beauty\" make their horses wear a bearing rein, which forces them to hold their heads unnaturally high. (In the syntax of children's movies, hurting an animal is an extreme sign of depravity. Consider Willy's owners in last year's \"Free Willy\"; they wanted to do in the whale to collect his life insurance.) Girls are a mystery to boys.   Girls are so threatening or yucky or divine that boys have to band together in formal alliances like the He-Man Womun Haters Club of \"The Little Rascals\" or in informal hordes just to maintain their equilibrium. In \"Milk Money,\" three preadolescent boys raise $100 as a group to pay a prostitute to expose her breasts. At a treehouse slumber party, when they all bring objects that mystify them, the collection includes a diaphragm and an eyelash curler. The hippest of the three explains his world view: \"It's a battle of the sexes and believe me, we are way behind.\"    Children are likely to note, however, that no matter what happens before, the movies' endings are politically correct, pulled like a rabbit from a hat. Girls get into Spanky and Alfalfa's club because \"things have to change sometime.\" The prostitute in \"Milk Money\" becomes rich and independent. Fred Flintstone shakes off his contaminated wealth and renews his friendship with Barney. Black Beauty lives into retirement, Lassie gets her sheep farm, and Andre the seal returns to the wilds.    Shortly after Lassie had gone over the falls and the family presumed her dead, I overheard two young companions discussing the turn of events. \"It's obvious she's not dead,\" said the 8-year-old. The 11-year-old agreed: \"Yeah. She's the star, and the stars never die.\"   That's what they learned at the movies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"B. H.

How can this be, one hears the vexed reader protesting, aware of decades of unimaginative British retreads of Broadway classics that have had neither a heart nor a soul of any description. The answer lies in the absorption into the mainstream musical in England of a handful of directors trained primarily in the classics, not in the klieg lights of Broadway.   These are people used to textual reinvestigation, willing to subject \"Carousel\" and \"Cabaret,\" to cite just two examples, to the same scrutiny they apply to Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and Brian Friel. Do they always come up trumps? Sometimes, truth to tell, a quintessentially American genre is distorted, not enhanced. (That was the Lerner and Loewe estate's view of the British director Howard Davies's \"My Fair Lady\" last season, which owed more to the director's own 1992 production of \"Pygmalion\" at the Royal National Theater than to Moss Hart and Hanya Holm.) But at its best -- as in Nicholas Hytner's Tony Award-winning staging of \"Carousel\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center in New York -- this esthetic allows us to see as if for the first time shows we always thought we knew; there's fresh affective music in the old songs yet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"On Revising Classics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/arts/l-music-censorship-on-revising-classics-068721.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Richard Taruskin's article \"The Trouble With Classics: They Are Only Human\"  [ Aug. 14 ]  purports to be a review of a new recording, but ends up being a call for censorship in classical music because of a so-called anti-Semitic phrase in a motet by Busnoys.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Hangman's Tree Deserves New Name and More Help","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/nyregion/l-hangman-s-tree-deserves-new-name-and-more-help-100471.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In your Aug. 21 F.Y.I. column, you concentrate on the value of wood, rather than on the value of nature's artworks lost to arborcide.

These two sections surround a stunning collection of photographs of the best-known rock stars of the 60's. Mr. Landy's images refract the inspiration he felt while documenting performances by Janis Joplin at the Newport Folk Festival and by Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix at the Fillmore East. \"If the 60's generation wanted to change the world, the musicians were viewed as the leaders,\" Mr. Landy writes. \"As artists they had discovered how to tap into the essence of the time, how to utilize masses of energy to move people and communicate their feelings.\" Mr. Landy discusses at length his professional and personal relationship with Bob Dylan, particularly the sessions that resulted in the cover for the album \"Nashville Skyline,\" a photograph that he says \"perhaps . . . reflects the love we were all seeking to find through making the world a better place.\" Mike Lang, one of the organizers of the Woodstock festival, asked Mr. Landy to photograph the event; the images of the peaceful, communal life Mr. Landy witnessed there stand in an interesting, though frustratingly brief, contrast to the violence shown in the book's opening paragraphs.

The house, a National Historic Landmark administered by the Connecticut Historical Commission, was converted into a school by Ms. Crandall from 1833 to 1834 -- arguably the shortest-lived school in the state.   Its demise was the result of prejudice and threats from area residents because the pupils were young black women who, Ms. Crandall believed, were entitled to a better education than they were getting elsewhere.   A decade or so ago the building was restored and reopened as a museum, and recently Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. designated Sept. 3 a state holiday honoring Ms. Crandall and her academy.   Visitors on Saturday may take self-guided tours of the museum and its current exhibition, \"Woman's Work Is Never Done,\" and there will be a multitude of activities: Children can participate in sack races, egg-and-spoon and three-legged races, hopscotch and a checkers tournament. An adult horseshoe-pitching tournament will be held at noon, and at 1 and 3 P.M. American folk music will be performed by Ruth O'Neil on guitar and Rosie Edgar on fiddle.   Throughout the day artisans will demonstrate theorem painting, chair caning, American Indian beadwork and wood carving and other Colonial crafts. Among several food options are waffles cooked over an open fire -- a popular annual feature prepared by members of the Canterbury Historical Society.

The occasion is the sixth annual Founders Bank/Eli Whitney Folk Festival to be held on Saturday in Edgerton Park, an English 18th century-style park built in 1909 in New Haven and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   Each year the festival presents major folk musicians in concert, using with the proceeds going to further the work of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, a 16-year-old non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to wildlife protection, water pollution and waste disposal. The other recipient is the Farmington Canal Rail-to-Trail Association, which has been successful in converting three miles of the washed-out rail bed that replaced a 1828 canal into a jogging, biking, hiking trail in Cheshire. Three more miles in Hamden are under reconstruction and the goal is to extend the trail from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts.

They both cover aspects of a part of the world that most of us will never see in person. \"Tribal Treasures: Carpets and Jewelry from Central Asia\" will run through Sept. 11, containing a treasury of Turkmenistan culture lent by private collectors.  \"The Afghan Folio,\" a photographic exhibit may be seen through Sept. 6.   For many centuries Nomadic peoples sharing a richly diversified heritage with the Middle East, North Africa and Russia, produced an array of rugs and textiles that they used in decorating or covering their portable dwellings known as yurts. A simulation of a yurt interior is in the exhibition.   In recent decades many nomad weavers have settled down in one place and made a living from selling their richly designed and brilliantly colored carpets and cloth in bazaars and to dealers. Some 50 carpets, animal covers, wedding trappings and prayer rugs are on view.   Gold and silver jewelry inlaid with carnelian and other stones or colored glass has been a staple of Turkmen traditional costume. Restrained and simple in design it takes the forms of headdresses, collar clasps, earrings, girdles, breast ornaments, bracelets and rings as well as embellishments for knives, rifles and household implements. Forty pieces are on display.   \"The Afghan Folio,\" a set of 32 dye transfer print photographs by Luke Powell, is the result of several visits to Afghanistan during the 1970's when Mr. Powell recorded villages, mosques, ruins, people and cultural traditions on film, before much of it was destroyed in war.   The collection is considered exceptional for its artistry and its encapsulation of a fading culture. Previous showings were held at the Asia Society in New York, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, Manesh Hall in Moscow and the United Nations European Headquarters in Geneva.   The Bruce Museum is reachable from Exit 3 of Interstate 95, open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday from 2 to 5. Admission is $2.50, $2 for children 5 through 12 and older people, free on Tuesdays. Call 869-0376 for more information.

Between now and the first round of voting next April, every political speech, every decision, every maneuver will be viewed through the prism of the presidential race.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Letters Are Acts of Faith","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/books/l-letters-are-acts-of-faith-069973.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The joy of letter writing has not yet been lost to the ages.

The graduation percentage rate, from a National Collegiate Athletic Association report released this summer, includes scholarship athletes entering school from 1984 through 1987. The figure in parenthesis is the change from the 1993 N.C.A.A. report, which covered players entering from 1983 through 1986. 1. NEBRASKA: GRADUATION RATE47 (0) 1993 TIMES RANK5 REASONS TO BELIEVE: The narrow Orange Bowl loss to Florida State reaffirmed the conviction and imagination of Tom Osborne's program and demonstrated how close Nebraska is to the top. Quarterback Tommie Frazier has emerged as a complete player, and four returning starters in the offensive line provide continuity. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: Two new starters in the secondary, a game against U.C.L.A. on Sept. 17 and a path to the Orange Bowl that goes through Norman, Okla., on Nov. 25. 2. ARIZONA: GRADUATION RATE48 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK 15 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Quarterback Dan White and returning offensive linemen, including guard Warner Smith, could be in a better position to support a dominant defense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: If the Wildcats reach their first Rose Bowl, meeting a relatively low-ranked opponent could direct the attention of pollsters elsewhere. 3. FLORIDA: GRADUATION RATE 45 (+4) 1993 TIMES RANK 2 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A new 4-3-4 defensive approach should provide assistance for a maligned defensive backfield and strengthen a unit that returns 18 of 22 players. Terry Dean's strong finish last season made him the No. 1 quarterback. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: The new status as a preseason No. 1 has played mind-games elsewhere in the past. A recent history of road disappointments will become an issue when the Gators begin an imposing late-season challenge -- a grudge game at Florida State and a possible Southeastern Conference championship game within an eight-day period. 4. MAIMI: GRADUATION RATE 53 (+2) 1993 TIMES RANK 15 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Fiesta Bowl humiliation to Arizona, one very bad day without any incentive, made Hurricanes' decline seem worse than it was. Defensive end Rusty Medearis, who may start two years after a severe knee injury, will add an emotional boost. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: There may not be enough time to allow quarterback Frank Costa to reestablish his leadership. Games against Washington and Florida State could threaten what by then should be the longest home-field winning streak in college football. 5. FLORIDA STATE: GRADUATION RATE 40 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK 1 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A continuing collection of talent should compensate for the losses from a championship unit. But a No. 1-ranking has little margin for error, and the transition at several positions might require one. Sophomore tailback Warrick Dunn could one day hold a Heisman. Quarterback Danny Kanell, once a prized recruit, will take over the offense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The fallout from the off-season scandal may be far from complete. What little dropoff between Charlie Ward as a finished product at quarterback and Kanell in the early stages could become the difference between a champion and challenger. 6. PENN STATE: GRADUATION RATE 72 (+6) 1993 TIMES RANK 6 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Seven returning offensive starters will include tailback Ki-Jana Carter and quarterback Kerry Collins. Carter averaged 6.6 yards a carry, and Collins threw two interceptions in the last three games, including the Florida Citrus Bowl victory over Tennessee. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Eight new defensive starters and an unsettling reality that is new for Penn State but old for other Big Ten members: A New Year's trip to Pasadena must be preceded by a game at Michigan. 7. ALABAMA: GRADUATION RATE 40 (+5) 1993 TIMES RANK 23 REASONS TO BELIEVE: The Tide has lost just 2 of the 26 games Jay Barker has started as quarterback. In his senior year, Barker will have the help of the offensive coordinator Homer Smith, who has returned to Alabama. Six returning defensive starters include linebacker Michael Rogers, safety Sam Shade and cornerback Tommy Johnson. Punter Bryne Diehl and place-kicker Michael Proctor give the Tide outstanding special-teams play. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Jon Stevenson is the only returning starter in the offensive line. But another soft non-conference schedule should delay any serious challenge until the Tide travels to Knoxville on the third Saturday in October. 8. NOTRE DAME: GRADUATION RATE 82 (-3) 1993 TIMES RANK 4 REASONS TO BELIEVE: This should be the season for tailback Lee Becton to become appreciated as the player he has already become. A relatively simple early schedule could leave the Irish 8-0 going into the Florida State game at Orlando. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: A defense with four returning starters, including outstanding free safety Bobby Taylor, will have just one of the top six tacklers from a year ago. The attention inspired by Ron Powlus, the gifted first-year quarterback, conceals a potentially dangerous problem: Notre Dame does not have a quarterback who has taken a snap in a game. 9. MICHIGAN: GRADUATION RATE 68 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 13 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Tyrone Wheatley's power and reliability. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Tyrone Wheatley's separated right shoulder. 10. WISCONSIN: GRADUATION RATE 71 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 11 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Tailbacks Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher combined for over 2,400 yards in 1993. Quarterback Darrell Bevell leads an offense with nine returning starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Eight days that should help determine the Big Ten race: Oct. 29 at Michigan, Nov. 5 at Ohio State. 11. COLORADO: GRADUATION RATE 55 (-5) 1993 TIMES RANK 17 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Nine returning offensive starters include the entire interior line. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The defensive secondary, a major problem last year, will be tested in non-conference games against Wisconsin, Michigan and Texas. 12. AUBURN: GRADUATION RATE 35 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 3 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A soft early schedule, with non-league games against Northeast Louisiana and East Tennessee State, should help ease the transition for offense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The surprise factor is gone following last year's undefeated season, and N.C.A.A. probation remains. 13. VIRGINIA TECH: GRADUATION RATE42 (+6) 1993 TIMES RANK18 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Maurice DeShazo, who directed an option offense last year, threw for 2,080 yards and finished fifth in the nation in passing efficiency. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Two starters in a readjusted offensive line must advance quickly. 14. OKLAHOMA: GRADUATION RATE 48 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 12 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Running back James Allen leads eight returning offensive starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Quarterback Garrick McGee, a junior-college transfer once at Arizona State, leads team that opens at Syracuse and Texas A&M. 15. TENNESSEE: GRADUATION RATE 46 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK8 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A deep offensive line, led by guard Jeff Smith, should help quarterback Jerry Colquitt in his first season as a starter. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Opener at U.C.L.A. and Sept. 17 game against Florida. 16. U.C.L.A.: GRADUATION RATE 60 (+4) 1993 TIMES RANK 19 REASONS TO BELIEVE: J. J. Stokes is considered the best receiver in the nation. Quarterback Wayne Cook provides reliability. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: With early games against Tennessee and Nebraska, the work of a rebuilt offensive line will become essential. 17. NORTH CAROLINA: GRADUATION RATE 68 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 25 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Jason Stanicek threw for 1,874 yards in 1993. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The offensive line has one returning starter -- center Pat Conneely. 18. SOUTHERN CAL: GRADUATION RATE 52 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 21 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Rob Johnson, who completed 68.6 percent of his passes last season, could introduce a quarterback to the quartet of Heisman-winning runners within Heritage Hall. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Only four returning defensive starters and opening games against Washington and Penn State. 19. TEXAS: GRADUATION RATE 44 (+9) 1993 TIMES RANK31 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Quarterback Shea Morenz will lead an offense with nine returning starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: A rushing game must develop for the Longhorns to achieve offensive balance in John Mackovic's third year as head coach. 20. TEXAS A&M: GRADUATION RATE 37 (+2) 1993 TIMES RANK 9 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Running backs Rodney Thomas and Leeland McElroy will give the Aggies a chance to extend S.W.C. record of 22 consecutive league victories. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: If streak ends, being on probation may remove late-season incentive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Vancouver","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/travel/l-vancouver-042404.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: We clip your articles and use them, often when they are yellowed with age because of our travel schedule!

Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, publicly broke ranks with most of his colleagues today, saying he believed that the nation's central bank should seek to hold down unemployment in setting interest rates.   Speaking at the Federal Reserve's annual conference here, Mr. Blinder said that while controlling inflation was important, the Federal Reserve could limit unemployment for a few years at a time through low interest rates. He strongly criticized the idea, widely held among his colleagues and many economists, that a central bank would be more effective in fighting inflation if it focused solely on maintaining stable prices.   Mr. Blinder's comments revealed an intellectual split within the Federal Reserve, but seemed unlikely to produce a split over policy for the time being. Mr. Blinder said he thought unemployment in the United States, which stood at 6.1 percent in July, was now roughly as low as it could go without feeding inflation.   The clear implication of his comment, though not explicitly stated, was that the Federal Reserve could continue to raise short-term interest rates to fight any threat of inflation as long as unemployment stayed low. First Clinton Appointee    But Mr. Blinder's comments did suggest that if unemployment and inflation rose simultaneously again, as occurred in the 1970's, he would be much more reluctant than his colleagues to raise interest rates further.   Mr. Blinder is President Clinton's first appointee to the central bank, and his comments today were especially significant because he is a leading candidate to head the central bank when Mr. Greenspan's term expires early in 1996. President Reagan first appointed Mr. Greenspan in 1987, and President Bush appointed him to a second term in 1992.   In contrast to Mr. Blinder's statements today, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has tried for years in testimony before Congress to distance the central bank from responsibility for unemployment. Mr. Greenspan told a House panel on Aug. 10 that maintaining stable prices was the primary goal of the Federal Reserve.   He reminded Representatives that he had previously testified in favor of a bill that would require the Federal Reserve to pursue zero inflation above all other goals, including the reduction of unemployment.    He has said he does not believe sustained reductions in unemployment can be achieved by permitting low interest rates and rising inflation. Long-Term Approach    While Mr. Greenspan has never publicly defined the duration of a sustained reduction, none of his comments have suggested that the Federal Reserve might be able to hold down unemployment for a few years, as Mr. Blinder suggested today. Mr. Greenspan said on Aug. 10 that any unemployment gain was \"ephemeral\" and \"very quickly dissipates.\"   Mr. Blinder did say he did not believe that interest rates could be used to hold down unemployment over the long term -- which he defined as 5 to 10 years.   He said he believed the economy was now roughly at the maximum level of employment possible without feeding inflation. He had testified at his Senate confirmation hearing last spring that he supported the Federal Reserve's first three interest-rate increases.   He is widely rumored to have supported the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates by another half a percentage point on Aug. 16, although Fed officials have refused to confirm or deny this. Mr. Blinder has never publicly expressed a view on the Fed's fourth interest-rate increase, which took place in May, after his confirmation hearing but before he joined the Fed.   Mr. Greenspan made an oblique reference here on Friday to his distaste for using low interest rates and higher inflation to hold down unemployment, a tactic known in economic policy circles as using monetary policy to seek macroeconomic gain.   \"Any tendency to seek a bit of macro policy relief by pushing on the outer limits of monetary policy risks longer-term financial instability,\" Mr. Greenspan said. Endorsing a Fed Goal    Congressional Democrats amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1978 to require the central bank to seek full employment as well as price stability. It is this amendment that the bill supported by Mr. Greenspan would change.   But in an interview after his speech today, Mr. Blinder endorsed the full-employment goal. \"A central bank should have an employment objective,\" he said. \"The evidence is overwhelming.\"   Janet Yellen, who is President Clinton's other appointee to the Federal Reserve Board this year, also endorsed the use of monetary policy to hold down unemployment at her confirmation hearing in July. But she was not as emphatic as Mr. Blinder was today, nor did she actually criticize the idea that central banks can control inflation better if they do not look at unemployment.

The ruling gave the victory to Britain's Damon Hill. Race stewards ruled that a mandatory wooden plank under Schumacher's car, recently required by Formula One and aimed at slowing down drivers, did not meet legal measurement requirements. It was either too thin or too light, giving him an advantage over his competitors. The incident is the third this year to jeopardize Schumacher's dominance, which once seemed vulnerable only to the guardians of Formula One racing. Schumacher, who could have won his eighth title, is already driving under an appeal of a two-race suspension for disregarding a black flag at the British Grand Prix. The German so dominated Sunday's race that even a sloppy spin in the 18th lap failed to allow the competition within striking distance. He finished 13.663 seconds ahead of Hill, his closest challenger in the title chase. The spin could have shaved some wood off the board, which is 30 centimeters wide, one centimeter thick and runs the length of the car. The car is allowed to lose only one millimeter during the race, but the ruling report said up to 2.6 millimeters were missing.

Yet the NATO leaders ignored a far more serious strategic threat that is gathering momentum in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia and other former Soviet republics have pressed forward with plans to create a military alliance that mocks President Clinton's Partnership for Peace, doing precisely what that proposal was designed to avoid: creating new Eastern and Western blocs.

The infant may look as though it has a penis but there is little or no scrotum to be found, leading those in the delivery room to wonder whether they are seeing a boy with undescended testes or a girl with a greatly enlarged clitoris. Or it may later turn out that a newborn with the external genitals of a boy has a female's ovaries inside.

One after another, and then by the dozens, rafts began appearing in the water in front of Havana's oceanfront, known as the Malecon, and a few miles east at Cojimar, which has become the main launching point for those who want to escape from Cuba. Many of the Cubans had been camping on the beaches for days, waiting for the weather to improve.   Trucks also began arriving, depositing people who had come from Alamar in the east and Pinar del Rio in the west, 120 miles away. The trucks carried boats that the refugees had been building at their homes. Because of the current in the Florida Straits, the coast around Havana is the best launching area for the mostly unpowered boats.    Hundreds of well-wishers lined the beaches near Havana as the exodus resumed. A Weather Predicter    No one has been able to predict the flow of refugees, but the weather has been one prognosticator, even better than pleas by Fidel Castro or President Clinton.    Indeed, there has been less science and method involved in how many people have left than there has been strong emotion, including anger at Cuba's economic deterioration and impatience to get on with what everyone knows is a perilous journey.   [ Despite the ample evidence that the number of Cubans leaving was rising sharply, relatively few were picked up by the Coast Guard. As of 10 P.M. Monday, 253 Cubans had been intercepted, up from 84 on Sunday. Last week, in the first rush, the Coast Guard picked up 13,600. ]   \"Tell my mother that I have gone and that I am very happy,\" Marbel Betancourt Gonzalez said just before she jumped into the turquoise waters of Cojimar to scramble onto a rubber and wooden raft with 10 others. Miss Betancourt, who had slept on the beach for nine days waiting for her journey, turned to face the crowd of hundreds of people piled on a crumbling sea wall, and with tears in her eyes she waved and blew kisses.   It is impossible to predict how many Cubans will leave in this wave, but today's activity indicates that the United States policy to deny them automatic asylum will not keep many people at home.   In fact, some of the Cubans say there is an urgency about leaving now.   Two brothers, Felipe and Jesus, came from Pinar del Rio, about 125 miles west of Cojimar, to leave from Cuba in a boat that they had assembled by soldering together pieces of aluminum, then painting it over with tar and padding the inside with plastic foam.   \"We're afraid Mr. Castro is going to say, 'No more,' so we have to leave now,\" Jesus said. \"We came here because this is the closest point to the United States, and it is a good place to launch a boat.\"   The brothers also said that on their stretch of the coast the Government's coast guards still seemed to be patrolling the waters. At Cojimar, there were only a few soldiers in camouflage uniforms, and they did not seem to bother the people leaving. First Boat Leaves    The first boat to leave this morning from Cojimar was a tidy contraption of rubber and wood. It, too, had come on a truck, and it had a wooden rudder and a bow made of aluminum, with lines of thin rope on its perimeter for its passengers to hold onto and a jaunty red yachting flag atop its rough-hewn mast.   One by one people boarded the boat, as hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the littered beach to see them off. A festive atmosphere pervailed. Vendors were selling tamales and guanabo turnovers. The only ones not laughing were the six women and nine men who pushed off, rowing at the direction of an older man who was clearly their captain.   Some people were dispensing advice. One man told a would-be refugee how to judge how far his raft was from tankers that navigate the straits. He told him to hold his hand out in front of him in a fist, with his thumb sticking skyward, and to close one eye. \"If your thumb covers the whole tanker, then he's 10 miles away,\" the older man told the younger one.    Some carried good-luck charms on board. One boat had the Virgin of Charity on its bow. One refugee tried to take his dog on the raft, but the animal ran down a dock away from him.    Ramon Perez Lara, who is 61, was at the beach helping his son Sergio, who would be making about his 30th attempt to leave. The two men personify the debate about whether it is better to abandon Cuba or to stay and make it better.    Mr. Perez fought in the revolution. His family grew tobacco and corn on their small parcel of land, but the inequities of life before Castro's rule left the countryside poor of many things Cubans now have, he said.    \"I learned to read and write after the revolution,\" he said proudly.    But his son, Sergio Lara Caras, has felt let down by the revolution. He made his first attempt to try to leave Cuba on a home-made boat five years ago, when he was 29, and he has been trying ever since. Twice he was picked up by Soviet tankers and turned over to the Cuban authorities.   He has been in prison three times for his so-called treasonous crimes, and has served as long as eight months. He has gotten as far as 35 miles out to sea, far short of the 90 miles to Florida.    \"Castro has turned my struggle into something political by saying I am betraying the country,\" Mr. Lara said. \"But it is only economic. This country does not have opportunities for me anymore. Because I have been arrested for trying to leave, I cannot get the kind of work that will help me have a life.\"   With tears streaming down her face, Berta Serrano Belot waved from the beach to a raft carrying her oldest daughter, 30, and her youngest son, 18.    \"For a mother this is the biggest pain in my entire life, to see my children leaving,\" said Mrs. Serrano, holding a granddaughter's hand.    Another daughter's husband was also on the boat, along with others from their town of San Miguel del Padron, about a three-hour bus ride from here. They had come to Cojimar as a family 12 days ago, and had camped on the beach.    They spent their days scavenging for bits of lumber and other material to build their boat. They bought what they needed with the money they got from selling many of their possessions back home. They had only a few pesos each day to buy bread.    But finally today, those who wanted to go were on their way.    \"I never thought my children would abandon me, but the ruin this country has fallen into has created such misery and hunger that it has forced them to go,\" Mrs. Serrano said, her voice trembling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/style/chronicle-094153.html","abstract":"  ISMAIL MERCHANT, the film producer, and JAMES IVORY, the film director, were hosts of a benefit concert and dinner on Saturday night for the Merchant & Ivory Foundation, a four-year-old nonprofit organization that operates a film center in Claverack, N.Y.

As the November elections approach, Pequot money is flowing across the country in abundant and increasing amounts, to Albany and Hartford as well as Des Moines and Sacramento. And virtually all of it is going to Democrats.   In just the last few months, the tribe -- whose roughly 300 members are expected to earn about $600 million from the casino this year -- has given $100,000 each to the Democratic Party organizations in New York and California and $50,000 to the state party committee in Iowa, all at the direction of national party leaders. It has pledged $250,000 for other state campaigns still to be named. And with total donations of $315,000 over the last two years, it has become one of the single largest contributors to the Democratic Party's National Committee, joining the ranks of huge corporations like Time Warner and big unions like the National Education Association.   What all this means, for the Pequots and the Democrats, is an open question.   Lobbyists and lawyers for the tribe say that Democrats have been good to the Pequots, and American Indians generally, and that across a broad spectrum of issues, from health care to education, the tribal council believes that the Clinton Administration is on the right track. Local Democrats helped the tribe gain Federal recognition in the 1980's -- an old debt that can now be repaid -- and Mr. Clinton held an American Indian summit at the White House in April that was viewed by the Pequots as symbolically significant.   And while some critics grouse that the tribe is only furthering its economic interests as the owner of a huge gambling enterprise, there is little evidence of a Pequot agenda.   The Republican National Committee has offered no comment on the donations or the tribe. Democratic officials in the states getting money say they have had no contact with the tribe, and in the states closest to the casino -- Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- where the tribe would presumably have the keenest interest in influencing debate about gambling, the Pequots and Democrats say there have been no contributions at all.   But people in both parties say that the tribe has found a quick way to become a player in the game of politics. While the size of contributions to individual candidates is limited, the tribe can give as much as it wants to the state and national parties, gaining the maximum good will from party leaders.   \"I would imagine that all they're trying to do is expand their influence,\" said State Senator James T. Fleming, a Connecticut Republican and an opponent of casino gambling. \"As long as it's legal, I don't see anything wrong with it.\"   In Connecticut, the tribe formed a political action committee in July that could under state law give unlimited amounts to candidates. Tribal lawyers said they were also considering forming a national PAC.   Earlier this month, Carrie Saxon Perry, a former Mayor of Hartford and a Democratic candidate for the State Senate, held a fund-raiser at the casino, on the tribe's reservation in Ledyard. Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, a third-party candidate for governor, plans to do a star turn there next month, at a $250-to-$500-a-ticket fund-raiser in a hotel ballroom. Expanded Lobbying Efforts    The tribe has expanded its lobbying efforts, too. It opened a Washington office this year, and a in Hartford this spring its largess surpassed even that of Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino developer who has spent millions in Connecticut over the last few years to try to end the Pequots' monopoly on casino gambling in the state. The Pequots paid a Hartford public relations company $210,000 through mid-June, compared with the $152,000 spent by Mr. Wynn on lobbying, according to the State Ethics Commission.   Experts in American Indian affairs said that many tribes have long had political action committees, and that political contributions have gone up in the last few years. But the Pequots, if only by their grand scale of doing things, still get the attention.   And like all of their previous efforts to test themselves and their newfound economic sovereignty -- from the expansion of land claims to the development of a Pequot legal code -- the new flexing of political muscle is also sparking anxieties about where the tribe is going and what it will do when it gets there.   A lobbyist for the tribe, Charles J. Duffy, said that those \"sensitivities\" had led the tribal council to take what state elections officials say is an extraordinary step: the Pequots will limit contributions to local candidates from its new state PAC, even though it does not have to.   Mr. Duffy said the tribe would consider donations to Democratic and Republican candidates, but will hold donations to the same maximum allowed for business PACs, which can donate only up to $5,000 to a gubernatorial campaign and $500 to an individual state legislative race, with a $100,000 cap on all contributions.   \"We don't want people who are averse to the tribe to be making egregious claims about what the tribe is doing and what it intends to do,\" Mr. Duffy said.   That has not stopped people from questioning, however, why a small tribe would ship its money so far from home.   \"It is my belief that any sound-thinking person would ask why, in this case, an Indian nation would send a significant donation to a political party or elected official in another state,\" said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester County Republican who asked this month for a Federal investigation into the Pequots' $100,000 contribution to the New York Democratic Party.   Mr. Spano, an advocate of casino gambling in New York, said in a letter to the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, that the State Legislature's defeat in July of an amendment legalizing casinos came within days of the tribe's donation, and that the appearances and timing were questionable, though he had no direct evidence of any wrongdoing.   Chris McNeil, a tribal lawyer who heads the Washington lobbying effort, said the Pequots had had absolutely no contact with New York Democrats, and that the state committees that have received money were all suggested by the Democratic National Committee as places where Democrats could use extra help this year.   \"There's no connection,\" Mr. McNeil said, referring to the gambling issue in New York and the tribe's contribution.   Still, party officials in Iowa and California said that even though the Pequots' national political agenda is vague, their ability to write big checks has not gone unnoticed.  Keeping Track of Friends    Mike Monasmith, a spokesman for the California Democratic Party, said the money had come with no strings attached, but that, if only to protect itself, the party always knows who its friends are.   \"We are sure to make sure we know where they money is coming from,\" Mr. Monasmith said.   In Iowa, Democrats said the Pequots had asked for nothing in exchange for their $50,000 donation.   \"We have some good Congressional races and a good chance of knocking out a Republican governor, but how that ties in to the tribe's agenda, I'm not certain,\" said Ron Parker, a spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party. \"We have no contact with the Indians.\"   Here in Connecticut, where the tribe clearly does have an established agenda -- to keep non-Indian gambling operations out of the state -- politicians said they hoped the new Pequot PAC would be low-key about any kind of loyalty pledge.   \"It should not be a single-issue PAC and I don't think it will be,\" said Edward L. Marcus, the Connecticut Democratic Party chairman. \"I'm not sure that would make too many candidates all that comfortable.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"For Ex-Judge Wachtler, Real Estate by Day, Card Games and Meatloaf at Night","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/nyregion/for-ex-judge-wachtler-real-estate-by-day-card-games-and-meatloaf-at-night.html","abstract":"  During the day, Sol Wachtler will broker real-estate deals from a glass high-rise in an affluent section of Long Island.

And it was, in a performance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Saturday night at the Damrosch Park Band Shell, presented by the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival.    One revelation of the performance was how quickly one begins to associate individual dancers with specific roles. When \"Company B\" was first presented in 1991, the stars of the dance seemed to be the Andrews Sisters, to whose songs the piece was set. As the high of that nutty music wore off, Mr. Taylor stepped into the star role, pouring dance out onto the stage that captured the war years of the 1940's and made subtle use of period social dances but also revealed, even more subtly, the dark subtext of many of the songs. Bobby-soxers and their boys next door kick up their heels with abandon in \"Company B.\" But every so often a dancer drops to the floor and lies still as the dance goes on.
