The \"Frontline\" program recounted how the South African diamond cartel conspired with advertisers to maintain high prices by creating the illusion that diamonds were rare. \"Packaging the New,\" which opened this week at the Cooper-Hewitt, traces the history of an esthetic cartel -- industrial design -- and the mythology devised by designers to enlarge the market for furnishings, appliances and other household goods.   Focusing on the work of six noted American designers, the show traces a 50-year period beginning in the mid-1920's, when industrial design became an organized profession, and culminating in the mid-1970's, when the oil crisis and environmental degradation prompted widespread disillusion with the industrial juggernaut. Donald Deskey, Russel Wright, Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, Walter Dorwin Teague and Henry Dreyfuss: those were the cream of the industrial-design profession.

An exhibition called \"The Golden Age of Danish Painting\" may sound like the one about a cookbook called \"Great English Cuisine.\" But Americans who revere \"Your Show of Shows\" as a treasure from the Golden Age of Television are in no position to laugh. Copenhagen in the first half of the 19th century was not Athens under Pericles. But Ozzie and Harriet aren't exactly Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen.   Kierkegaard and Andersen are familiar names, at least. Only a handful of Americans have ever heard of the artists who lived in Denmark at the same time and painted what is in the show opening on Sunday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: artists like Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Christian Albrecht Jensen, Wilhelm Bendz and Johann Thomas Lundbye. The exception may be Christen Kobke. For good reason, Danes sometimes speak of the period as the Age of Kobke and his works are rightly the centerpiece of this exhibition of more than 100 paintings by 17 artists.

But these days the foundation is under scrutiny from many quarters for the way it conducted itself, from the actual fund raising to the way the money was spent. Of $9.7 million collected through direct mail between September 1992 and December 1993, none went to purchase toys, although some toys were bought with corporate donations, said Lieut. Gen. Matthew T. Cooper, a retired Marine commander who was appointed president and chief executive of the foundation last fall. \"It all went to pay the expenses of direct mail,\" he said.  Holes in the Bookkeeping    In April the chairman and president, Jerry L. King, was dismissed after board members discovered he had been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, all unrelated to his foundation work.

One prominent example is the fate of the alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who turned his back on more adventurous jazz in the early 1960's. He continues to make recordings that, as he puts it, bought him a house: music deep in the popular blues tradition. But he has suffered at the hands of critics. Mr. Donaldson, who is as fine a be-bop saxophonist as exists, is rarely considered a master.   He is performing with a group that includes Lonnie Smith on organ, Peter Bernstein on guitar and Ben Riley on drums. In two performances last week (on Feb. 1 and 3) Mr. Donaldson made the be-bop language pliable, delivering a small sampling of Charlie Parker's innovations with a soft tone and lyricism. Like Parker, he rarely took more than a few choruses, but a lot happened within those few choruses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940212","headline":"U.S. and Allies Send More Planes for Possible Strikes in Bosnia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/world/conflict-balkans-us-allies-send-more-planes-for-possible-strikes-bosnia.html","abstract":"  British and French aircraft carriers headed for the Adriatic today, and the United States prepared to send more fighter bombers to bases in Italy as NATO formally began the countdown on its demand that Bosnia's Serbs lift their siege of Sarajevo within 10 days, military officials said.

A superb English chorus of 10, directed by Peter Philips, the Scholars came fresh from performing this program on the actual death date, Feb. 2, in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, where Palestrina was trained and worked.

They use short, folkish phrases and subtly strategic harmonies to give songs a sense of tenderness and rising optimism; the turns seem both surprising and inevitable. Such craftsmanship calls for musical expertise and something beyond technique: remembering that the best songs are made to touch listeners, not to impress.   Ivan Lins is one of those songwriters. Mr. Lins, a major star in Brazil who has lately recorded in English, takes after Milton Nascimento both in musical specifics -- a baritone voice that rises to a yearning falsetto, a gift for ballads and a broad palette of local Brazilian rhythms -- and in the general benevolence that radiates from his songs. Like Mr. Nascimento, he concentrates on the music; for two decades, he has worked primarily with the lyricist Victor Martins.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940212","headline":"Russian-Language FM Is Window on 2 Worlds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/world/russian-language-fm-is-window-on-2-worlds.html","abstract":"  Their voices crackle over the airwaves, some timid and creaky with age, others brazenly curious.

It comes after 20 minutes of eccentric passagework, its limpid line seeming to condense out of the sometimes bewildering mists. It is tantalizing, sung by instruments not associated with light-footed dance: the tuba, the contrabassoon and the bass.    The effect of this waltz, at once unsettling and uncanny, is typical of Mr. Schnittke's music, which is being honored in New York with a series of major performances. The Philharmonic's program will be repeated tonight and on Tuesday.

The young American composer, lyricist and librettist has effectively deconstructed the melancholy and skeptical Viennese sex comedy without putting it back together. The new work is not an adaptation of the Schnitzler play, but it is an impertinent, sometimes haunting, often jokey commentary on it.   \"Hello Again,\" directed and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, is still about the daisy chain of sexual encounters that begins when a whore has al fresco sex with a soldier, who then makes love to a young woman, who moves on to a different young man, until, at last, the ninth and final partner returns to the whore. The Schnitzler play, which is about romantic dreams repeatedly dashed, is contained within the small, hermetically sealed world of turn-of-the-century Vienna. Mr. LaChiusa liberates the Schnitzler characters but at a certain cost to coherence. They now move freely back and forth in time, through the first nine explosive decades of the 20th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"F.Y.I.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/fyi-155438.html","abstract":"  Limits of the Law Q.

In this vein, the reascent to the top of the charts of Mariah Carey's newest album, \"Music Box,\" signals more than her musical dominance.   Part of Ms. Carey's significance -- and undoubtedly the sharpest controversy around her -- has nothing to do with the singer's musical gifts. Instead it derives from the confusion and discomfort that her multiracial identity provokes in an American culture obsessed with race. Though she has made no secret that she is biracial (her mother is Irish-American, her father is a black Venezuelan), Ms. Carey's candor evokes clashing responses from fans and critics. Some see her statement of mixed heritage as a refusal to bow to public pressure to choose whether she is black or white. But in light of the \"one drop\" rule -- where a person is considered black by virtue of having one drop of black blood, a holdover from America's racist past -- many conclude that the issue of racial identity, for Ms. Carey and other interracial people, is settled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Amy Sue Weber, Marc A.

When photography first came along, it was too slow for most events and had to settle for the sites. In 1855, during the Crimean war, the English photographer Roger Fenton took a picture of the Valley of the Shadow of Death after the killing was over and nothing remained but spent cannonballs. During the American Civil War, photographers unable to stop the action recorded bridges, ruins, \"The Scene of General MacPherson's Death\" after the general's body was removed. When faster lenses and films were devised, the event itself became primary again, but since photographers are not always in the right place at the right time, the site and its aftermath have been subjects often enough.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Two for the Roads: A Vision of Urban Design","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/architecture-view-two-for-the-roads-a-vision-of-urban-design.html","abstract":"  WE'RE RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL OF URBAN visionaries.

A self-taught black painter working in Norwich, Conn., Ruley died violently in 1959, at the age of 77, under suspicious circumstances. Or, as Glenn Robert Smith argues (with the help of Robert Kenner), convincingly if luridly, he was murdered in a racially motivated attack. Married to a white woman and the imperious patriarch of a racially mixed extended family, Ruley took up painting in his later years. His surviving production, presented here in rich color illustrations, comprises small, highly simplified works on board, including pastoral and hunting scenes, landscapes and motifs reworked from photographs in popular magazines. An essay by Stacy Hollander, a curator, and Lee Kogan, a senior research fellow, at the Museum of American Folk Art, traces Ruley's likely sources, primarily stock images of popular heroes and bathing beauties that the artist appropriated to construct a kind of private idyll, a fantasy imagery of male desire with some affinity, as the authors note, to the work of Rousseau. The monographic approach by Mr. Smith, a California collector of folk art, and Mr. Kenner, the former editor of Art & Antiques -- a melodramatic account of Ruley's life and a search for sources and influences -- seems intended primarily to establish a market for Ruley's paintings. The book does not address a range of issues currently being raised in relation to the work of self-taught artists, like the ways race, class and difference shape their work. The book does, however, present interesting new material to be explored in those discussions.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Angel Falls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/travel/l-angel-falls-166740.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Your readers might like to know that it was a news photographer in search of a story who led the first overland expedition to Angel Falls, in May 1949.

When any seal migrates, its greatest danger comes from the threat of being eaten by a shark.   Due to the incredible overfishing of shark by sports and commercial fishermen the shark population has dwindled substantially since the 30's to the point where shark fishing is barely being allowed.

WHY: The traditional flat lid -- the one that allows coffee to slosh over the top and onto the drinker's clothing -- may be acceptable for the 50-cent, no-name brew from the corner deli. But not for $2.75 cappuccino or espresso doppio. With their stylish brews, coffees bars have introduced the lids to Manhattan. DOUBLES AS A HAT: The visual effect is startling. The lid looks like a white derby sitting atop the cup. Although there are several variations on the dome lid, all of them let the coffee drinker sip through a small hole in the curved mouthpiece. The lid goes by a variety of names, depending on the manufacturer: Traveler Lid, Sipping Lid, Gourmet Lid. SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE: Manufacturers claim that by raising the roof on the coffee cup, they have advanced the technology of take-out coffee in two ways. First, they talk about \"a splash barrier\" or a \"spill-free drinking environment.\" They say that with an inch of air above the cup, \"coffee doesn't slosh out, doesn't bounce out.\" Second, they say the dome provides space for whipped cream or steamed milk. In other words, they say they have eliminated \"the squish factor.\" WHO MAKES IT: With the growing popularity of both coffee bars and America's takeout life style, competition in the lid business is steaming. Solo Cup Company of Highland Park, Ill., says that it created the genre of the dome lid five years ago and holds a patent on it. Sweetheart Cup Company of Chicago came out with a dome lid a few months ago.   Now, the two are locked in legal combat. Solo has filed a lawsuit, charging patent infringement, against Sweetheart. Molly Powers, Solo's marketing manager, said that no one at Solo could talk about the company's lid, or even provide a sample to be photographed, because of the legal battle. Sweetheart is not reticent. \"The case is frivolous,\" said Daniel M. Carson, the vice president and general counsel of Sweetheart.   Steve Smith, the product manager for hot beverages at Sweetheart, is already claiming a victory. \"Our rate of delivery is better,\" he said. \"When you tip the lid to drink, you don't get too much and you don't get too little.\"   The main difference between the lids lies in the mouthpiece: indented on Solo's, raised on Sweetheart's. COST: Despite the fancy engineering, manufacturers and retailers say the dome lids cost a coffee vendor no more than the flat versions.   Good news, no doubt, for people whose favorite coffee already costs as much as a sandwich.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"FILM CRITICISM\nTHE PHANTOM EMPIRE\nBy Geoffrey O'Brien.\nNorton, $20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"'One Long Orgiastic Read'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/one-long-orgiastic-read.html","abstract":"  THE LITERARY COMPANION TO SEX An Anthology of Prose and Poetry.

St.-Tropez Day Trips  Q. I will be in St.-Tropez, France, for the last week in March and the first week of April and would like to travel on day trips to places like Vence, Nice and Cap-Ferrat. Are there buses from St.-Tropez to these places? -- Susan Wexford, New York, N.Y. A. Bus service from St.-Tropez is very limited, but there are alternatives that will get you where you want to go.   One bus trip that you might not want to miss leaves from La Foux, three miles west of St.-Tropez, at 7:40 A.M. on Saturday, March 26, and proceeds the length of the Riviera to San Remo, Italy. The trip to San Remo, which the tour organizers describe as the flower capital of the Riviera, takes close to three hours and costs $22 round trip without meals, calculated at 5.8 francs to the dollar.   More information: St.-Tropez Tourist Office, Gare Routiere, St.-Tropez; 94.43.26.98.   Only two towns, Toulon and St.-Raphael, are served by buses from the bus station at St.-Tropez. Toulon is west of St.-Tropez, and therefore not in the direction you wish to go.   St.-Raphael, northeast of St.-Tropez, is 1 hour, 25 minutes away by bus. The first departure from the St.-Tropez bus station (94.97.41.21) is at 6:20 A.M. every day; departures after that are more or less hourly until the last bus at 7:15 P.M. The fare is $15.50 round trip.   The good news about St.-Raphael is that it has a railroad station (94.91.50.50) from which trains leave for Nice at frequent intervals, starting at 7:33 A.M. The journey takes about an hour and costs $19 round trip.    Once in Nice, a city with splendid museums and art galleries, you have a couple of options.    The Santa Azur company offers a variety of sightseeing bus tours in and around Nice. They also offer minibus tours with a bilingual driver and on these the passengers pick where they would like to go, putting such places as Vence, St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and Monte Carlo within easy reach. Prices range from $206 for a half day for one to three people to $310 for a nine-hour day. Prices for four to eight people are $250 for a half day and $336 for a full day.    More information: Santa Azur, 11 Avenue Jean-Medecin, 06000 Nice; 93.85.46.81, fax 93.82.38.78.   To rent a car with a bilingual driver contact Richard Dems at Avis Chauffeur, Agence Cote d'Azur, Place Massena, 2 Avenue des Phoceens, 06300 Nice; 93.62.50.96. Rates start at $168 for four hours and $327 for a full day.  The Budapest Expo  Q. Two years ago I read of plans for a World's Fair in Budapest either in 1995 or 1996. Do you have any updated information about it? -- Harlan D. Everett, Canandaigua, N.Y. A. The original proposal, in the 1980's, called for the 1995 World Expo to be held jointly in Budapest and Vienna. It was to have been the first formal linkage of the two cities since the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918.   In May 1991, however, a referendum was held on the proposal among residents of Vienna and the measure was defeated.   Since then Hungary has decided to go it alone. The Hungarian Parliament voted in December 1991 to hold the event in Budapest in 1996. The exhibition, to be held from May 11 to Oct. 4, will have communications as its main theme.    Some 10 million to 12 million visitors are expected.

The target is not the violence that is agitating viewers and politicians, but a creeping tabloidization, not only of local news, which serious observers have never considered of much account, but of national news too, pride of the networks.    On Tuesday, \"Frontline\" delivers a hardboiled report, \"Tabloid Truth: The Michael Jackson Scandal,\" which makes a strong case that more or less respectable news programs are succumbing to the subjects and techniques of the gossip shows. A similar lament, from professional watchers and perpetrators, was heard a few weeks ago at the annual Alfred I. Dupont Forum at the Columbia University Journalism School. The picture, simply put, is of television journalists chasing ratings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"In America; Health Care Squeeze","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/opinion/in-america-health-care-squeeze.html","abstract":"  The women who work for Ticketmaster in New York are not participants in the great national debates over health care and welfare reform.
