Our research demonstrates that those who make large contributions to Congressional candidates (and whose economic and legislative interests line up neatly with PAC inter- ests) provide more money to these candidates than PAC's do. In 1992, large individual contributions made up 35 percent of the total given to Congressional candidates, compared with 29 percent from PAC's. When you include Presidential candidates, large individual contributions ($375 million) dwarf PAC contributions ($180 million) more than two to one.   When you add large contributions from business-connected individuals to PAC contributions from the same businesses, the grand total dwarfs the next largest source of money -- labor -- by six to one. (If you compare PAC totals only, the ratio is three to one.)   PAC and large individual contributions together maximize the political clout of business. Our research shows this is true for every category of business, particularly health care, insurance and finance. Furthermore, the profiles of members of Congress who eschew PAC contributions, taking only contributions from individuals, show economically interested funding patterns virtually identical to those who accept PAC contributions.   Framing the campaign finance reform issue as a PAC issue encourages narrowly drawn \"reforms,\" which are more likely to freeze into place the worst aspects of the system or even make it worse. If we want real reform, which addresses the conflicts of interest and disenfranchising inequalities inherent in private financing of public elections, we need to understand the source of that financing. And that source is not just PAC's. ELLEN S.

On view is a remarkable exhibition of more than two dozen paintings and drawings and five sculptures by Max Beckmann, perhaps the most important German artist of the century. The show has an illuminating intimacy that penetrates the stiff, distancing layers that history and reputation so often give an artist, providing a glimpse of the inner workings of his mind and eye.   Beckmann died in 1950 in New York City at the age of 65, three years after he immigrated to the United States from Amsterdam, where he sat out World War II, and 13 years after he left Nazi Germany. Until 1933 he had been one of his country's most respected artists, with a room devoted to his work at the National Gallery in Berlin, but Hitler's rise to power and campaign against modern art changed that. Almost immediately, Beckmann, though not Jewish, was dismissed from the Stadel Art School in Frankfurt, where he had taught since 1925. Soon his paintings were yanked out of German museums, along with those by other members of the European avant-garde, to be placed in the Nazi's \"degenerate art\" exhibition of 1937.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940401","headline":"Bans on Cigarette Machines Are Upheld","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/nyregion/bans-on-cigarette-machines-are-upheld.html","abstract":"  Saying that \"ready access to cigarettes on the part of minors is a legitimate government concern,\" the New Jersey Supreme Court today upheld the right of municipalities to ban cigarette vending machines within their borders.

The schoolgirl, Junko (Saori Serikawa), is buffeted from one strange event to the next, never registering much more than worry or mild surprise. The director, Shinobu Yaguchi, concentrates on absurd coincidences, eccentric minor figures and long, studied shots in which characters look woebegone and do nothing. One of the few genuine insights provided by Mr. Yaguchi is that these days Jim Jarmusch must be the most eagerly imitated film maker in the world.   But it takes perfect deadpan timing, like Mr. Jarmusch's, to get this right. And \"Down the Drain\" lacks most of the necessary aplomb. Mr. Yaguchi's film begins promisingly with its first set of accidents, but its pacing eventually grows wearisome and slack. The events are crazy without being crazy enough.

Jose Maria Olazabal and Ben Crenshaw were a stroke back after two rounds. (AP) Floyd, Gilbert, Coody Atop Board: Raymond Floyd and Gibby Gilbert took radically different routes in The Tradition in Phoenix yesterday to reach the same place at the top of the leader board with Charles Coody. Floyd, who led Gilbert by one stroke after one round, shot a 70 and became the only player to make it through two rounds of the Senior PGA major tournament without a bogey. In six holes starting with No. 6, Gilbert made five birdies, then gave back four shots on Nos. 12 through 14. Coody's 67 made it a three-way tie.

The third-seeded Gimelstob, from Whippany, N.J., hobbled with an ankle injury and a pulled stomach muscle, will play top-seeded Cecil Mamiit of Los Angeles today.

China's acceptance of the U.N. formulation demonstrates just how diplomatically isolated North Korea now is.    In mid-February North Korea reached agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on inspections to assure that no diversion of nuclear material took place during the past year.

The director, Ildiko Szabo, has created a precise and moving route to these larger questions. The scenes of Zsolt painstakingly bathing his grandmother, singing to her and helping her put on her wig and makeup each morning are presented with an eerie fascination. \"It's morning,\" reads a sign Zsolt leaves on the blackboard for her. \"Everything is on the table.\" Each scene evokes pathos without sentimentality.

But it also seemed that all that was needed was a few more performances to work out matters of detail, tone and structure.   The promise of these concerts could be heard in the final movement, Mahler's most haunting Adagio, which invokes kitsch and sentimentality, sarcasm and mockery, only to subsume them into an extended hymn that in its final pages can suspend the motion of time.

Tournament; Four Teams With One Goal Yet to Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/sports/ncaa-tournament-four-teams-with-one-goal-yet-to-go.html","abstract":"  They have heard, for years, about The Road to this place. They watched teams of the past make similar journeys, all the way to the climax of the college basketball season, and wondered what the trip would be like. And now that they have survived to this point in an unpredictable season -- with Arkansas, Arizona and Florida in search of their first national championship and Duke trying for a third one in four years -- four semifinalists are left with the hope of a memorable weekend.   Arkansas will meet Arizona late Saturday afternoon (Channel 2 at 5:42 P.M.), before first-time semifinalist Florida opposes Duke to determine the Monday night finalists of the national collegiate tournament.  Metal Detectors at the Gates    An event that did not become the anticipated coronation of the 1993 champion North Carolina Tar Heels includes just one of the four teams seeded No. 1 in the regionals -- the Razorbacks of Arkansas, who are expected to receive the support of President Clinton.   The involvement of the President, who watched the Razorbacks win the Midwest championship last Sunday in Dallas, has given this tournament a fan of unusually high profile, and has created the need for metal detectors at the gates of the Charlotte Coliseum.   \"As long as he shakes my hand, it'll be all right,\" said Reggie Geary, a sophomore guard from Arizona and one of the defensive strengths of the Wildcats. \"I just want to meet him.\"   The Razorbacks, 29-3, are a more experienced version of the young team that made 12 of 20 3-point shots to overcome Arizona's zone defenses in an 86-80 victory over the Wildcats in December 1992.   \"I don't think you'll see zones tomorrow,\" said Damon Stoudamire, the junior guard who directs the Wildcat offense. \"They just killed us. They hit a lot of 3-pointers. They had quick hands. Their press kind of affected us a little bit. We really didn't play that well. I think with the team that we have this year, it's totally different.\" High Speed and High Scoring    Arizona, 29-5, overcame several recent tournament disappointments to become convincing winners of the West Regional. With Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves emerging as one of the leading backcourt combinations in the country, the Wildcats have won 12 of their last 13 games by making 49.7 percent of their shots and holding the opposition to 39.6 percent. Their quick-paced, full-court approach could challenge an Arkansas team that has been comfortable at that speed and could result in a game that threatens the record of 197 combined points in a national semifinal game. (The record was set in 1965 in U.C.L.A.'s 108-89 victory over Wichita State.)   Florida, 29-7, has extended the greatest season in its 75-year history by filling the void created by North Carolina's unexpected second-round defeat. The first Final Four appearance of the Gators, just seven years after they reached this tournament for the first time, came as a result of East Regional victories over Connecticut and Boston College. Not long after Coach Lon Kruger took over a program known more for its rules violations and improper conduct of players, he has established a team now recognized for its similarities to the respected Duke program led by Mike Krzyzewski. The Message Is What Matters    \"Any similarities would be interpreted as a huge compliment,\" Kruger said. \"We're playing a game. But he uses that opportunity to really develop and get across messages to his players that they can benefit from for the rest of their lives.   \"That is the significance of what we're doing,\" Kruger said. \"Certainly, this is nice. This is big. This gets a lot of attention. But the experiences of our players from these opportunities, and how they use those later on, are really important.\" Capel Rushes to the Rescue    The Blue Devils, 27-5, were expected to take some time to adjust to the loss of graduated point guard Bobby Hurley. Senior Grant Hill and freshman Jeff Capel have played key roles in the adjustment.    \"We've had a good team without knowing who our guards were,\" said Krzyzewski. \"Whenever I've had a problem, I've always put Grant in that position. For a lot of the year he has been that guard, but you wouldn't really call him a guard. So now with Jeff emerging as he has, even though we're in the tournament, we're changing a little bit.\"   Krzyzewski chuckled at the idea, then added: \"And I'm giving him a little more responsibility, because I think he can handle it now. And I think that's been the strength of our program. We've been willing to change, even late in the year and in the N.C.A.A. tournament to take advantage of the strengths of our players. Now we have the best guard play we've had all year, and we actually have people that we call guards.\" Stronger by the Game    Led by Hill, the all-America, Duke became stronger in the last several weeks because of the improved play of center Cherokee Parks and forward Tony Lang, as well as the emergence of Capel.   \"We haven't really had a true center,\" Krzyzewski said. \"So Cherokee has taken more of a normal progression to become an outstanding player. I've seen him, in the last month, be more vocal. You'd be surprised at all levels at how little big guys talk. And so if they can talk, and say something that's really good for their teammates, it has a tremendous impact on the team.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940402","headline":"Review/Pop; From the Band, the Name and Sometimes the Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/02/arts/review-pop-from-the-band-the-name-and-sometimes-the-sound.html","abstract":"  The chorus of Bruce Springsteen's \"Atlantic City\" declares, \"Everything dies baby, that's a fact/But maybe everything that dies someday comes back.\" When the Band sang it at the Beacon Theater on Thursday night, it took on new resonances.
