Within Us,\" a situation comedy masquerading as a science- fiction comedy, asks the audience to care about a 30-something couple on the brink of either a breakup or a marriage. The play, by Todd Davis Ross, is at Theater Row Theater (formerly South Street). While visiting the woman's younger brother and his fiancee in their Vermont cabin, the two principal characters find themselves confronted by unseen extraterrestrials who take over their bodies. We know that the characters have been inhabited by E.T.'s when they suddenly speak pompously and stand up straight as if they have boards on their backs. When not possessed, they slump and exchange coy dialogue.   This means that the actors playing the leads, Bonnie Black and Patrick Barnes, each have two voices. In contrast, Steven Sennett and Marceline Hugot, as the other couple, are limited to one-dimensional roles. Were this a fairy tale, they might be called Chirpy and Loony. The play is dopey.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19921226","headline":"Review/Dance; Wanderer Returns Briefly to City Ballet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/26/arts/review-dance-wanderer-returns-briefly-to-city-ballet.html","abstract":"  Ethan Stiefel, at 19, was very much a young man most likely to succeed at the New York City Ballet.

Is beauty, in other words, a seducer, something that leads us to confuse sensuous pleasure with devotion? Or is it a catalyst, religion's persuasive advocate? A lot of blood has been shed over that one in the last 1,000 years.   The practical side of the argument says that great music performed by experts puts Christians in the right frame of mind. A number of churches putting on Handel's \"Messiah\" this week seem to have thought along those lines. Orchestras were hired, and in most cases paid choir members found themselves joined by paid extras. Three \"Messiah\" presentations were at Episcopal parishes, all evidently with affluent memberships. \"We have sophisticated parishioners; they have come to expect music well done,\" said one singer in a choir he described as \"99 percent professional.\" With orchestra rehearsals and top-of-the line soloists, productions like this can run about $30,000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921226","headline":"Schools Can Build on Apprentice Programs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/26/opinion/l-schools-can-build-on-apprentice-programs-512492.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   By describing the experience of two Boston students in Project ProTech, you present a convincing case for apprentice programs in your \"Finding What Works\" series (front page, Nov. 26).

He sees himself as a classic American entrepreneur: a high-school dropout from the Bronx who taught himself a trade, works seven nights a week, earns $40,000 a year, and at age 26 has $75,000 in savings, all by providing a public service outside New York's theaters and sports arenas.   He has just one complaint. \"I've been busted about 30 times in the last year,\" he said one recent evening, after making $280 at a Knicks game. \"You learn to deal with it -- I give the cops a fake name, and I pay the fines when I have to, but I don't think it's fair.

A pet reindeer, Star IV, won the designation \"official civic attraction,\" and leads two children's parades each year.

In a state that depends on wildlife for sustenance and as a mainstay of the tourism economy, reindeer are regarded in much the same way as whales, walruses or wolves. A hedge of laws and regulations protects them much of the time. But this is no fairy-tale land. Reindeer can cause problems.

It is a glorious affair, in which all hopes are fulfilled and no twist or turn of Sickert's long career is omitted. Nor is his love of mischief smothered or kept out of sight.   There is a great deal to see in the 133 paintings in the academy. Sickert could do just about anything that he wanted to with brushes and oil paint (and sometimes with pastels, as well). From 1887 onward he could do the London music halls in their heyday.

It is work by Gwen John (1876-1939) and her brother Augustus (1878-1961). The relationship of Augustus John to the Mellon family, the primary force behind the British Art Center, is established at the outset with a 1924 portrait of Andrew Mellon. \n\nFramed by a traditional ennobling oval, the gaunt Andrew Mellon is a study in angularity: the way his head tilts in opposition to the picture plane and the way his hand is thrust into his pants pocket. One suspects this jauntiness might owe something to Cubism. Both brother and sister were conservative artists; their paint application is pronouncedly dry and their color ranges from A to B. Yet there are many indications that they knew their way around the modern world, and that they had a foot planted in each century is a large measure of their fascination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"From Jeff Koons's Shaggy Dog To Picasso's Still Lifes, Sans Ego","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/arts/year-arts-art-1992-jeff-koons-s-shaggy-dog-picasso-s-still-lifes-sans-ego.html","abstract":"  Art's Best Friend -- Jeff Koons's gigantic \"Puppy,\" a shaggy dog made entirely of flowers, and the biggest Chia Pet ever, which cast a shadow over the 1992 Documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany, from the nearby town of Arolsen.

A Biography of the Gentleman Director, by Patrick McGilligan. (Harper Perennial, $13.) George Cukor was one of the first great Hollywood directors, and one of the first in the film industry to encounter its sometimes virulent homophobia. This book shows how he managed to occupy a niche in two very different worlds. Last year our reviewer, Andrew Sarris, called it \"that rarity of rarities among Hollywood biographies: a full-bodied study of a man and his metier, equally insightful about the life and the art.\"     SUGAR: And Other Stories, by A. S. Byatt. (Vintage International, $10.) This collection of short fiction by the author of \"Possession\" includes characters who are witches and ghosts, although it is well grounded in the real world of emotions and morals. \"At her best, Antonia Byatt is elegant in the tradition of James and Forster, and her concerns are the enduring ones: the tenacity of the past and the clutch of family, the struggle for freedom and self-definition, and the quest for substantive truth in the shadow of death,\" Lynne Sharon Schwartz said here in 1987. Vintage International has also brought back into print the author's 1967 novel, THE GAME ($10), the story of two English sisters, opposites in personality, who have been involved with the same man. In 1968 our reviewer, Martin Levin, said, \"What is so admirable about Mrs. Byatt's treatment of her characters is her blending of what they are with what they believe.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"Inaugu-Wear for Sale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/style/inaugu-wear-for-sale.html","abstract":"  It must have been a slow news day.

The menu consisted mostly of dishes based on the composer's own recipes. The party was in Paris because Rossini spent the last 45 years of his life there, gourmandizing more than composing. The occasion was the release of an eight-CD album of the five early Rossini one-act comic operas.   Unfortunately, the performances, while amiable and honorable, are not top-drawer. And that pretty much sums up the record industry's response to this Rossini year: surprisingly few new recordings, especially from the major labels, and only a couple of them first rate. After the excess of the 1991 Mozart year, the treatment of Rossini has been decidedly anticlimactic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/books/in-short-fiction.html","abstract":"WHAT A PIECE OF WORK\nStories.\nBy Will Baker.\nUniversity of Missouri, $19.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"France Looks Back, Russia Forward, As Americans Rework the Present","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/arts/year-arts-classical-music-1992-france-looks-back-russia-forward-americans-rework.html","abstract":"  Most Obscure Hit -- The soundtrack from \"Tous les Matins du Monde,\" overseen by the violist da gamba (!)

Two years later, when major league baseball players negotiated a system of free agency after a court-affirmed arbitrator's decision, Ed Garvey, the man who negotiated the ineffective N.F.L. agreement for the players, ridiculed the baseball union for settling for less than the arbitrator had given the players.   Now, nearly two decades after the freedom-now strike, N.F.L. players finally have what they hope is a workable free-agency system. The owners, however, must still know something the players don't know because they agreed to the system as they watched their baseball brethren reinforce their belief that free agency would be bad for their pocketbooks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"Fast-Forward to 1993: What's On, Who's Off and What's Still Fuzzy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/sports/tv-sports-fast-forward-to-1993-what-s-on-who-s-off-and-what-s-still-fuzzy.html","abstract":"  A look back at 1993, courtesy of my crystal cathode-ray tube: JAN. 2 At Bill Parcells's first news conference as the head coach of the New York Giants, WWOR/Channel 9's Russ Salzberg asks, \"Who's gonna be your quarterback?\" After 30 minutes of invective by Parcells, the news media applauds Parcells's oratory.

Ethan Mordden's RODGERS & HAMMERSTEIN (Abrams, $45) examines the team's output on a show-by-show basis, with the benefit of the author's encyclopedic knowledge of musical theater. He discusses each show in the context of other Broadway developments, both before and since its premiere. According to Mr. Mordden, with Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the writing of the script became the fundamental act of composition\" and \"the musical-comedy composer and the operetta lyricist developed a 'healing' art as interested in discussing the advantages of community or analyzing the nature of love as in entertaining.\" Mr. Mordden, a prolific writer on the theater, argues that \"State Fair,\" the team's only original film score, is \"the one dud of their 17-year career,\" \"Pipe Dream\" is their \"only bomb\" and \"Carousel\" is their \"masterpiece.\" He also contends persuasively that \"Allegro\" deserves another look because it paved the way for the more contemporary \"concept\" musicals further developed by Michael Bennett and Stephen Sondheim. Mr. Mordden's approach may finally be more celebratory than critical. But given the enduring appeal of Rodgers and Hammerstein's creations, we're inclined to sing along.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"A Drag?

The New Yorker magazine was born at the Algonquin Hotel's round table, they say, and it was there that Miss Parker, on hearing of Calvin Coolidge's death, asked, \"How can they tell?\"   In other ways the lunch scene at the Royalton Hotel, diagonally across from the Algonquin on West 44th Street, near Fifth Avenue, is every bit as clubby as the old round table. Of course, wits like Heywood Broun, the original unmade bed, would be out of place in this stylish company.

Yet BACCARAT (Abrams, $95), glossily luxurious though it may appear, is curiously lacking in substance, organization and purpose. The photographs, by Jacques Boulay and Jean-Michel Tardy, are grainy and not lustrous. The cursory and very brief text by the French Academician Jean-Louis Curtis tells the basic facts about this illustrious company, tracing its history from its founding in 1764 by the Bishop of Metz, who recognized France's potential to compete with Bohemian artisans in creative glass design and manufacture. Swiftly we are told of the various interruptions at the factory due to political upheavals and wars, and about the reorganizations after such interludes. There is little mentioned about why particular designs were favored, nor is there explanation of why 19th-century society desired or required such elaborate crystal. The oversize photographs are not arranged chronologically, and the placement of most of the captions makes identification very difficult. An incomplete but useful glossary at the end of the book makes the reader wish that such information had been included throughout the text, describing more fully the objects themselves and using the objects in turn as examples. Two pages from an early Baccarat catalogue illustrate the elaborate ornamentation of a tableware service, but nowhere in the book is such a service described in detail or illustrated by photographs. For most of us, such information would have been most useful, since we might conceivably own a set of table crystal, but probably not a crystal Medici vase, scrolled, gadrooned and mounted on gilded bronze lion claws.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921227","headline":"Offering Immigrants From Russia Insights on Life in America","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/nyregion/offering-immigrants-from-russia-insights-on-life-in-america.html","abstract":"  THE spirited discussion, which covered the Iran-contra affair, former President Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal, the Communist Party, tensions in Crown Heights and the jury system, was nearly as biting as the bitter cold on a chilly Sunday morning.

Today's meeting could conclude recent weeks of negotiations that have brought both sides closer to an agreement than at any time in the last five years. The key issue remains free agency, with the players wanting more freedom to move to new teams without penalty.   The league has operated without a collective bargaining agreement since 1987, the final year of a five-year agreement signed in 1982. The agreement is expected to be unveiled for the 1993 season.   Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, and Jim Quinn, the players' attorney, after meeting for 12 hours last Monday and Tuesday, announced that a tentative agreement had been reached on Tuesday afternoon. Al Davis, the Los Angeles Raiders owner, and Gene Upshaw of the players association met over the weekend in Washington in an effort to help complete the agreement.   Davis, a member of the owners' negotiating team, has been among the owners who have pushed for a longer agreement (one of at least 10 years) and for more player exemptions (as many as eight per team).   If a deal is reached, both sides must present their plan to United States District Judge David Doty in Minneapolis for his approval.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19921228","headline":"Afghanistan, Armed and Abandoned, Could Be the Next Bosnia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/28/opinion/l-afghanistan-armed-and-abandoned-could-be-the-next-bosnia-126092.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In articles analyzing states and peoples suffering from weapons and conflicts left over from the cold war, such as \"Clinton Inherits Conflicts That Don't Follow the Rules\" (The Week in Review, Dec. 13), you include Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the successor states of the Soviet Union and some others.
