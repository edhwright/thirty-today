Ms. Dion, who appeared at Town Hall on Monday evening, is a belter with a high, thin, slightly nasal, nearly vibratoless soprano and a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch.

The pairing makes eminent good sense; these quartets were composed two years apart and share a similar threnodic minor-key palette. It's tempting to hear \"Death and the Maiden\" as a homage to late Beethoven, to find Schubert's whole conception growing out of Opus 131's elegiac sixth movement and savage finale.

One rarely hears performances that show traces of a separate cultural tradition. Hence the surprise and fascination of Tomohiro Okumura's recital at Alice Tully Hall on Monday night. This young Japanese violinist, the recipient of the 1993 Naumburg Award, played Bartok's First Sonata with a cool, rapt, meditative detachment that put the music in an intriguing new light.   It should be noted first that Mr. Okumura is a player of considerable technical fluency and tonal polish. Bach's Sonata in A, first on the program, promised an evening of refined, restrained musicianship; Saint-Saens's First Sonata, with its dazzling 16th-note cascades, added virtuoso glitter at the end. But the intense molding and shaping of sustained tones in the Bartok sonata alerted one to an unusual temperament. It somehow sounded more Japanese than Toru Takemitsu's tone-picture \"Hika\" (also on the program), without seeming at all unidiomatic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940303","headline":"Our Bomb Bay Doors OpenSomewhere Near Cassino","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/03/opinion/IHT-our-bomb-bay-doors-opensomewhere-near-cassino.html","abstract":"Since none of my children ever asked me \"What did you do in the war, Dad?\" I have decided after 50 years to answer the question anyway: \"I didn't bomb Monte Cassino.\".My big moment came on the morning of Feb. 15, 1944.

At the very least, the struggle has forced a group of players operating under championship demands to rearrange the Steinberg maps in their heads. Somewhere to the west, those imposing obstacles in Chicago, Houston, Phoenix and Seattle have recently been replaced, at least temporarily, by the threat of a duplex in Sacramento and a rapidly growing skyscraper across the Hudson. Sacramento? East Rutherford? They don't make vistas like they used to.   But maybe, in their interminable, guess-the-area-code existence, a lull well before the playoff push may be remembered as a showcase for the inspirational genius of the coach with the slicked-back hair. Pat Riley's search for the winner within produced two recent decisions that could one day go down in Knick history on the level of having Dave Stallworth guard Wilt Chamberlain. Or maybe not.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940304","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/04/arts/art-in-review-367664.html","abstract":"  James Turrell   Barbara Gladstone Gallery  99 Greene Street  SoHo  Through March 12    This new work by James Turrell is a coup de theatre and very beautiful, and it's only a pity that by encouraging people to see it, some of its impact may be diminished. \"Frontal Passage\" is the latest entry in Mr. Turrell's \"Wedgework\" series, which he began in the late 1960's. It is an installation approached through a blackened hallway, which lets out into a chamber barely illuminated on one side by reddish fluorescent lights. The lights seem to cut, like a scrim, at a diagonal across the room, slicing it in two. But that is purely an illusion, a \"spatial manipulation,\" as Mr. Turrell calls it, that goes to the heart of his art: his work is one of visual conundrums, a meditation on perception, light and color, in which there is virtually no there there. Yet what is there, in a darkened space, vibrating with misty light, has about it a definite and delicate poetry. The effect is best when the space is silent and empty. But don't miss this show, in any case.

Most of the paintings are small, meant to be held in the hand and viewed close-up, but each encompasses a whole world of ideas and sensations.   It is, for the most part, a wealthy world, of emperors and courtiers, provincial potentates and fevered lovers, into which, now and then, gods enter, doing pretty much the same things humans do. It's also a world of amazing cultural diversity.

The patient knows the suffering is unbearable and cries out for medication, but an insensitive or unknowing medical profession withholds adequate relief.    Even after years of warnings that doctors do a poor job treating pain, far too many physicians still shy away from prescribing narcotics or other strong pain relievers. Distressed patients can only hope they will change their habits after reading new Federal guidelines, issued this week, for relieving the pain caused by cancer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940304","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/04/arts/art-in-review-367702.html","abstract":"  Lester Johnson   Edward Thorp  103 Prince Street  SoHo  Through April 2    The deft, vaporous recent watercolor views of southern France in Lester Johnson's show are evidence of a long career still very much under sail.

Named after the first American ship to circumnavigate the upper North American Pacific coast and the female personification of the United States, Columbia was the first of five Space Shuttle orbiters to fly in space, debuting the Space Shuttle launch vehicle on its maiden flight on April 12, 1981. As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms heavier than Endeavour. Columbia also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an imaging pod on its vertical stabilizer."},{"title":"STS-62","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-62","description":"1994 American crewed spaceflight","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Typhoon_Owen%2C_STS-62.jpg/320px-Typhoon_Owen%2C_STS-62.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":259},"abstract":"STS-62 was a Space Shuttle program mission flown aboard Space Shuttle Columbia.

The two-week mission also featured a number of biomedical experiments focusing on the effects of long duration spaceflight. The landing was chronicled by the 1994 Discovery Channel special about the Space Shuttle program and served as the show's opening. A C.F.
