Introduced by Simon Rattle three years ago at Covent Garden, this production of \"Vixen,\" which runs through March 14, summons compelling new images that preserve both letter and spirit of the score.    On the surface, Janacek tells a story of foxes and their forest friends, of a gamekeeper and his tavern companions; underneath, he is picturing parallel cycles of love, loss, cruelty and compassion. This production has managed to grasp not only Janacek's two-tiered conception, but also the complexities of his context.

NEW YORK CITY   HAVENS EVAPORATE FOR HAITIAN REFUGEES   When Jean Silien Talabert came to New York last year, his brother eagerly gave him a place to live. But now his brother says he cannot support him any longer, and the 26-year-old Haitian refugee is staying with a woman he barely knows. Mr. Talabert, like many of the 1,000 Haitian refugees who ended up in New York after fleeing their violence-torn homeland in 1991, is finding the welcome wearing thin. Page 26.  REGION   HIGH TOLL FROM STORM   A nightlong storm battering the New York metropolitan region with snow, sleet, freezing rain and whipping winds, ripped roofs off buildings, tore down power lines and sent cars spinning like tops. The storm caused two deaths and dozens of minor traffic accidents. Thousands of commuters endured traffic jams and bus and train delays of up to eight hours. Page 27.

So the music lying open recently on facing Steinway grand pianos in his orderly studio here came as no surprise to a visitor from New York. On the right was Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 1, which Mr. Schiff will play on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Pierre Boulez. On the left was a volume of Schubert piano sonatas; Mr. Schiff will perform all 18 Schubert sonatas in the six concerts of the 92d Street Y's annual Schubertiade, beginning on March 17.   But a further glance around the upstairs study of the rustic house, across the Salzach River from the old city of Salzburg, began to reveal the real Andras Schiff, a probing, rounded musician whose concerns extend well beyond his instrument and his next few programs. Neat piles everywhere bespoke a rich variety of musical interests: books on Schubert and Debussy; scores of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony, a Reger string quartet, Bartok's \"Cantata Profana,\" Haydn's \"Theresienmesse,\" Schubert's Mass in E flat. Come to think of it, there was music for everything but piano; Mr. Schiff stocks most of his extensive repertory in his phenomenal memory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Anyone Here Miss Anderson?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/sports/pro-basketball-anyone-here-miss-anderson.html","abstract":"  With the Nets ahead of the Denver Nuggets by 28 at one point tonight -- you knew New Jersey was coasting when Coach Chuck Daly rested his $1,000 loafers, sat down, and didn't say a word -- it was time to have some fun.

Lindbergh, whom she met two years after his historic 1927 flight. The Lindberghs' 45-year marriage forms the centerpiece of this thoroughgoing portrait by Dorothy Herrmann, whose previous biography was of S. J. Perelman. Although Harold Nicolson described Mrs. Lindbergh with blithe condescension as \"an adorable little person,\" she proved equal to the dangerous, even death-defying pioneer flights she later wrote about, on which she accompanied her famous husband, serving as co-pilot, radio operator and all-round good sport. In 1932, she endured the kidnapping and murder of their firstborn son and the relentless press coverage the event produced. Later she weathered the fall from public grace that the couple experienced over Lindbergh's rigidly isolationist and pro-Nazi views, aspects of which she shared. While Ms. Herrmann seems intent on rescuing Mrs. Lindbergh's lyrical if occasionally cloying writings (13 books of nonfiction, poetry, fiction and memoir in addition to her 1955 best seller \"Gift From the Sea\"), her subject ultimately trips up the biographer. Because Mrs. Lindbergh placed duty to her husband before devotion to her craft, Ms. Herrmann suggests, her longevity as a writer was compromised. \"In a sense,\" she writes, Lindbergh \"and their extraordinary life together were her only subject.\" If that is so, then perhaps it is no coincidence that Mrs. Lindbergh, now 86 years old, has published virtually nothing since 1974, the year her husband died.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"President Asserts His Opponents 'Lack the Vision' on the Economy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/us/president-asserts-his-opponents-lack-the-vision-on-the-economy.html","abstract":"  President Clinton, seeking to counter accusations that his Administration is more interested in spending money than in cutting the deficit, said today that his critics \"lack the vision\" to improve the economy.

But beyond this shimmering mirage hides a gritty yet much more interesting city, buffeted by waves of renewal and decay. This Baltimore is a blue-collar, beer-drinking, industrial port. At the same time, it is a city filled with art -- from outstanding collections amassed by 19th-century merchants to the Picassos and Matisses of the Cone sisters to innovative new works produced by national and local artists attracted by Baltimore's texture and diversity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Children's Choirs Are Flourishing In County Churches","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/children-s-choirs-are-flourishing-in-county-churches.html","abstract":"  Music, which is gasping for breath in the county's public schools, is alive and well in its churches.

We were unprepared for, and delighted by, Wilmington's variety and charm.   Situated near the point at which the Cape Fear River flows into the Atlantic Ocean, about 70 miles north of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Wilmington offers a wide enough range of activities to make it an ideal vacation spot for the sort of family in which each member has wildly incompatible ideas of what constitutes a good time.

A man of my age, bearing an uncanny resemblance to me and calling himself Philip Roth, turned up in Jerusalem shortly before I did and set about proselytizing for \"Diasporism,\" a political program he'd devised advocating that the Jews of Israel return to their European countries of origin in order to avert \"a second Holocaust,\" this one at the hands of the Arabs. Inasmuch as his imposturing constituted a crisis I was living rather than writing, it embodied a form of self-denunciation that I could not sanction, a satirizing of me so bizarre and unrealistic as to exceed by far the boundaries of amusing mischief I may myself have playfully perpetrated on my own existence in fiction.\n\nNow, in life as in art, mischief can be a relief from all the prescriptions. The more scrupulously exacting the prescriptions, the greater the relief afforded by the mischief. Perhaps because of the abundance of prescriptions both internally and externally generated by Jewish history, perhaps because of the singular sort of care that living as a Jew has generally required, perhaps because of the exaggerated seriousness with which a thoughtful Jew is often burdened, Jewish mischief -- as couched, say, in the inexhaustible jokes about their peculiarities that Jews themselves so much enjoy -- flourishes, surprisingly enough, in even the most superdignified Jewish circles. The mischief subverts all the strategies that the Jewish predicament imposes, affords immeasurable if transitory relief not only because it is counterprohibitive but because it is counterparanoid as well, indifferent to threat, to enemies, to all the defenses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"THE TWIN TOWERS: The Bomb; Stored Chemicals Were Blast Waiting to Happen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/the-twin-towers-the-bomb-stored-chemicals-were-blast-waiting-to-happen.html","abstract":"  Investigators working on the bombing of the World Trade Center said yesterday that some of the chemicals found at a self-storage locker in Jersey City had been combined in a highly volatile mixture that could have exploded with great force at any time.   \"All you needed for a big explosion was a drastic change in temperature or for someone to knock over one of the containers,\" said one explosives expert who has been monitoring the investigation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"NO MORE NICE GIRLS\nCountercultural Essays.\nBy Ellen Willis.\nWesleyan University/University Press of New England, $22.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Honoring New York Citizens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/style/evening-hours-honoring-new-york-citizens.html","abstract":"  The Municipal Art Society's salute, Feb. 28.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Knee Sidelines Bream","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/sports/sports-people-baseball-knee-sidelines-bream.html","abstract":"  First baseman SID BREAM of the Braves underwent surgery late Friday night in Atlanta to remove a bone chip from his right knee and he might not be ready to play when the major league season opens in Chicago on April 5.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Holding On and Letting Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/books/holding-on-and-letting-go.html","abstract":"  ANNA   A Daughter's Life.

Danto raises the issue of consent. Unlike Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand or Diane Arbus, who all caught their subjects off guard, unaware or simply not knowing how they would look, Mapplethorpe got his subjects' full trust because he was part of their world. The thrill of these photographs, writes Mr. Danto, the art critic for The Nation, is that of \"the child who finds it delicious to be thrown in the air, certain his father will not let him fall.\" Thus, rather than catching the suspicious glare and passionate flurry of hostile strangers, Mapplethorpe caught the calm, clear look of those who want to be seen, say, urinating into the mouth of a friend, or up to their elbows in someone else's anus. Whether he was photographing the artist Alice Neel's ragged face when she was near death, or his roommate, the singer Patti Smith, nude and clutching some radiator pipes like a mental patient, or Mr. 10 1/2 exhibiting his organ on a table like a slab of meat, the staginess, the stillness, the symmetry all indicate Mapplethorpe's subjects were not just about to walk out of his viewfinder or his world. But what did he get from the luxury of consent? In a word, domestication. Even the most shocking photographs are tamed by the permission implicit in them. The picture of Elliott grabbing the testicles of Dominick, who is chained upside down, is so planned that it looks, as Mr. Danto says, like \"a fisherman being photographed next to some immense tuna he has caught.\" And one of the best shots, \"Man in a Polyester Suit,\" featuring a smooth, uncircumcised penis lolling out of a man's fly, is funny because it is so offhand. Mapplethorpe got so much permission for so many things that he made us forget, at least occasionally, what he was getting away with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"For Gay People, a Time of Triumph and Fear","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/for-gay-people-a-time-of-triumph-and-fear.html","abstract":"  After enduring weeks of vitriol in battles over homosexuals in the military, the St. Patrick's Day parade and school curriculums, gay and lesbian New Yorkers are taking stock -- many hurt and angry, others scared but defiant.   \"It's terrifying that outright bigotry against us is acceptable public discourse,\" said Howard Cruise, 48, a cartoonist who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens. \"People wouldn't dare talk about any other group, blacks or whatever, the way they talk about us.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"A U.S. Hotel List Notes Fire Safety","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/travel/practical-traveler-a-us-hotel-list-notes-fire-safety.html","abstract":"  FIRE safety for travelers moved ahead as this year opened. The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 began to have an impact on the marketplace with a drastic revision of the Federal Travel Directory. This makes it the first guide to American lodging that lists only places that have a smoke detector in every room, wired into the hotel's electric system, and, in the case of buildings taller than three stories, have installed a sprinkler system. Battery-operated smoke detectors are unacceptable because batteries wear out and can be stolen.    The Federal Travel Directory has been published for years, but now the safety act dictates that it may list no American hotel or motel unless it conforms to the law's provisions. To accomplish this, the Government gathered a list of conforming properties from the states and territories and then purged from the Federal Travel Directory all the places not on this master list, shrinking the directory from 9,000 listings in December to 4,164 in January. Federal Travel Directory    The Federal Travel Directory is not a likely rival for the Mobil Guide or the A.A.A. Tour Book, because the type is pretty small and there are no pictures. You have probably never seen it unless you are a Government employee, but it is revised and published anew each month, and anyone can buy a copy for $13. The initial issues for 1993 by no means include all the places that have taken the fire-safety steps; some have not gotten their reports into the system, although Government officials expect the data gathering, which is being accomplished through state fire marshals, to catch up soon. In any case, unless a hotel offers a \"government rate,\" meaning a discount, it is not included. Some foreign hotels offering discounts for Government travelers are included, but they are not subject to the law. The installation of detectors or sprinklers is noted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"The Danish Heroes of Holocaust Rescues","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/the-danish-heroes-of-holocaust-rescues.html","abstract":"On Oct. 1, 1943, the Jewish New Year, 6-year-old Leif Donde fled Copenhagen with his family.\n\nThe Nazis, who had occupied Denmark since 1940, chose that day to begin arresting and deporting the 8,000 Jews in Denmark.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Distorting Language For Political Control","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/style/l-distorting-language-for-political-control-940493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Michiko Kakutani's analysis of the leftist politically correct campaign to twist the English language into a political weapon of the left wing's own design is quite accurate (\"The Word Police,\" Jan. 31).

(\"The sardonic rat of no man's land,\" Harpur's wife calls him.) Given the morally ambiguous climate of this treacherous nether world, mistakes can be made, as Sarah Iles, the wild young wife of Harpur's boss, learns in COME CLEAN (Foul Play/Countryman, $20) when she goes slumming with an attractive gangster. After witnessing a killing in an underworld bar, Sarah and her lover are marked for assassination by both parties in a territorial gang war.   Although the plot takes the requisite crooked turns on its way to a violent finale, the characters are what give this series its hard-bitten brilliance. Saving the psychological realism for dreary people like Sarah (\"stuck in that wrong, bleak marriage\"), Mr. James lets his language soar with his criminals, characterizing mobsters like Benny Loxton and Leo Tacette in a mock-heroic style that confers dignity as well as absurdity on their aspirations for greatness.

Breaking the seal on the envelopes, Mr. Whitemore has his characters meet in mid-missive, a bit difficult when dealing with the cloistered world of Dame Laurentia, the Abbess of Stanbrook. Talking to her, the men sometimes look as if they are in a confessional. Another problem is the simple fact of the threesome. Most epistolary plays have had only two people onstage, which leads to focus as well as give-and-take. With \"The Best of Friends,\" letters and excerpts from other writings are broken up into a semblance of conversation. For all of its pretense, this is less a play than an elaborate platform reading.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"From a St. Patrick's Parade Loyalist, Support for Gay Marchers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/nyregion/metro-matters-from-a-st-patrick-s-parade-loyalist-support-for-gay-marchers.html","abstract":"  WHETHER a parade memorializing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. can be ordered to include marchers from the Ku Klux Klan is just so much contrived supposition, Paul O'Dwyer suggested the other day.   \"I can't conceive of the Klan wanting to march side by side with American blacks,\" the former City Council President said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/nyregion/chronicle-892693.html","abstract":"  She is about to turn 94 years old, and she has not taken pictures since 1959, but tonight ILSE BING will receive the first Gold Medal for photography to be awarded by the National Arts Club at a dinner and reception in her honor.

The Abbey, the official national theater, is also providing some heat with a flickering controversy about its artistic director, Garry Hynes.   Since Ms. Hynes, who is 39, arrived in Dublin from provincial Galway County, to take over the Abbey two years ago, she has been the constant target of the Dublin theatrical establishment, led by newspaper and magazine critics. They slashed her 1991 production of \"The Plough and the Stars,\" largely because she had audaciously presented Sean O'Casey's gloomy characters with shaven heads, recalling Sinead O'Connor, to the dismay of many Dubliners who detest that singer. Since then, she has been under attack for putting on the wrong plays, for putting them on with imported actors (like Brian Dennehy, who filled the house with his portrayal of Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's \"Iceman Cometh\") and for ignoring the players of the Abbey's own permanent company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"U.N.

Courier's brisk 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 mastery of the 21-year-old Ferreira not only rendered the three-of-five-set format gratuitous, but further tightened his grasp on the No. 1 ranking in the world.   The 14th-ranked Ferreira lamented his inability to exert any leverage in the final: a strain to his serving shoulder, an ailment he inflicted on himself during the pre-match warm up, stopped him from getting a good grip on his service games.

The closing wasn't greeted with much public commentary or hordes of television cameras. Salsa Meets Jazz no longer had a fancy profile; after so many years, it had become low key. Pairing the finest salsa orchestras with the finest jazz musicians, it let them find common ground. The common ground often shook, and the shows worked, week after week. Like all things that are consistent, Salsa Meets Jazz had been taken for granted.   It shouldn't have been, and the program's death, from rising costs and a dwindling audience, makes the city just a little more musically impoverished. Under the guidance of Symphony Sid Torin, a disk jockey, and Jack Hooke, a music-business entrepreneur, the series began as a straight Latin music show and then evolved into something special. Over the years -- it took a decade off, between 1970 and 1980 -- it had provided an extraordinary meeting of cultures and some of the best music the city could offer. All the great Latin bands came through, from Oscar D'Leon, the James Brown of Latin music, to Eddie Palmieri, the music's crazy, brilliant uncle; Mario Bauza, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo and Mongo Santamaria all showed up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"Review/Dance; Pittsburgh Ballet's New Direction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/arts/review-dance-pittsburgh-ballet-s-new-direction.html","abstract":"  As one of George Balanchine's most popular ballerinas in the New York City Ballet from 1950 to the mid-1960's, Patricia Wilde could have been expected to direct any other ballet troupe along strictly Balanchinian lines.

It's a point many senators would probably dispute if they weren't so busy scrounging for funds. As the chart at right suggests, the senators have to churn out a lot of cash.    Mr. McConnell calls the Democrats' proposal to clean up campaign financing in part by using taxpayer funds an \"entitlement program for politicians.\" It's a mystery why a Republican would want to prolong the system under which his party lost control of the Senate.
