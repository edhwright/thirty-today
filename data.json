The budget commission is a nonpolitical, business-sponsored fiscal watchdog. Its well-documented analysis of police operations takes aim at just two soft spots -- officers in desk jobs, and the departmental work schedule. The Mayor says he is considering other ways to save money at no loss to public safety.

If electric cars were permitted to operate as taxis in New York City without buying a medallion, it would give the operator of a nonpolluting electric taxi an effective $150,000 head start.

As the narrator recalls the growing threat to European Jewry, from Kristallnacht in November 1938 to the death camps of the 1940's, Mr. Klein tells how his parents' efforts to flee to America were repeatedly blocked by State Department functionaries.

I have to find the proof. I have to delay. And then,\" Mr. Domingo stops and suddenly claps his hands, \"the really first, first moment of tremendous fury or desolation is 'Ora e per sempre addio' \" -- Otello's farewell to all he has lived for.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940406","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/06/style/chronicle-695939.html","abstract":"  Forget the Prince and Princess of Wales.

One can talk of admirable works for solo cello by Reger, Kodaly, Hindemith and Ligeti, but it was Britten who approached the unapproachable, writing utterly private music that thought aloud in intermingling confessional voices.   Like all of Britten's late cello pieces, the Third Suite was written for Mstislav Rostropovich; with its filigree of Russian quotations and huge passacaglia climax, it also has strong links to the music of Shostakovich. Mr. Rostropovich ceased performing the work in public after Britten's death, finding the personal associations too difficult to bear, but other cellists have confronted its great technical as well as emotional challenges. Colin Carr, who performed the Suite alongside Kodaly's solo Sonata at the Kaye Playhouse on Tuesday night, knows the idiom as well as any.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"Small Businesses Certainly Do Create Jobs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/opinion/l-small-businesses-certainly-do-create-jobs-705098.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Myth: Small Business as Job Engine\" (Business Day, March 25) tries to make the case that large companies are at least as proficient as small ones at job creation.

On a bad night they can make a listener thank punk rock for plowing guitar-playing windbags six feet under.

Punk rock may have completely altered the rock landscape, but the Allman Brothers, who finish an eight-night, sold-out stand at the Beacon this weekend, don't seem to care, and neither does the band's adoring audience.   The group sells the sound of the guitar, and all the freedom and wildness that, in rock, the instrument implies. Over the years the band has been transformed from a sleek and swinging group to something more ponderous. The jazz influences have given way to a rock heaviness, and at Tuesday's show the music had its bloated and slow moments, sounding thick around the middle. At times Warren Haynes, who has completely absorbed the sound of Duane Allman, the group's original guitarist, pulled together solos of melodic beauty; he and the group's other guitarist, Dickey Betts, aren't afraid of using major scales to produce melodies.

To prove it, you have only to go to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where the Matisse mural of 1932-33 from the Barnes Collection is now on view. That this majestic achievement should be there at all is a historic reversal of the famously bad relations that had prevailed between the Barnes Collection and the Philadelphia Museum during the lifetime of Dr. Albert Barnes.
