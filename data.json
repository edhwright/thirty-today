Boeing 757 is an American narrow-body airliner designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe then-named 7N7, a twinjet successor for the trijet 727, received its first orders in August 1978.\nThe prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982, and it was FAA certified on December 21, 1982.\nEastern Air Lines placed the initial 757-200 variant in commercial service on January 1, 1983.\nA package freighter (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 followed by a combi model in September 1988.\nThe stretched 757-300 was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. \nAfter 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest 737 Next Generation variants as a successor to the -200."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19960206","time":"1996-02-06
