Naipaul are an interlocking series of journeys. The longest and the most difficult was his first. In 1950, just before he turned 18, he ventured from the New World to the Old World, from Trinidad, where he was born -- the grandson of emigres from India -- to England, where he had a scholarship at Oxford University. Eventually he became a writer with a world perspective, and he has never stopped traveling. These travels have inspired 22 books of fiction, history and commentary. At 61, Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul is a self-remade man, a distinguished man of letters with a penetrating view of life, and of his life, as a source for literature. As he says: \"One isn't born one's self. One is born with a mass of expectations, a mass of other people's ideas -- and you have to work through it all.\"   For Mr. Naipaul, his new book, \"A Way in the World\" (to be published next month), is, in the Proustian phrase, a \"pilgrimage of the heart.\" It represents the author's search for selfhood and for an understanding of the effects of inheritance. In this highly personalized narrative, he looks back at his books and relives the creative process in a new form. \"A Way in the World\" is, he says, \"a settling of accounts for me with myself,\" for what he regards as errors of artistic judgment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Connecticut Q&A;: Michael B.

Organized by the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, where it remains on view through June 19, the show will travel to Spain and the Netherlands but not to the United States. Given Eisenman's stature, the oversight is startling but symbolically apt. For a quarter of a century, it has been this architect's fate -- more accurately, his chosen path -- to remain just slightly beyond the pale.   Obsessed by his place in history but terrified of being pigeonholed, at once covetous and contemptuous of public acceptance, Eisenman, 61, has made a career out of his alienation from conventional practice. While scarcely an obscure figure, he has attained prominence within the profession by cultivating the impression that he remains outside it, claiming that his work amounts to a sustained critique of what the rest of the profession is up to. This despite the fact that in the past few years Eisenman has completed or begun a small city's worth of major commissions, including a convention center and an art museum in Columbus, Ohio; two office buildings in Tokyo; a design school in Cincinnati; a theater complex in Atlanta; and a 40-acre housing and commercial development in Frankfurt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/connecticut-guide-851108.html","abstract":"  DARROW DELIGHTS   Since 1933, when his first cartoon was published in The New Yorker, Whitney Darrow has extracted chuckles and guffaws from millions of people who then looked forward to the next of his more than 1,500 drawings.

Along these roads, temples and rest houses were built for the travelers who wanted to worship the gods and sleep comfortably afterward. In northeastern Thailand, two such Khmer temples, Phimai and Phanom Rung, survive. The first of these was begun perhaps as early as the 11th century; both were certainly completed before 1200.   Because of their distance from the capital, the temples are relatively small, but they are handsome nonetheless. And there are few tourists: During my two visits over the last year, there were several groups of Thai schoolchildren at Phanom Rung; very few visitors at all at Phimai. Conveniently, both can be visited in a day's excursion from Korat (also known as Nakhon Ratchasima, which is the name, too, of the province of which this is the main city). The drive through the Thai countryside is picturesque, passing by villages of houses on stilts, a fair complement of water buffaloes, occasional banyans and flame trees, and providing views over the Korat plateau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Law-Abiding Americans Find Reason to Laud Singapore Justice; Celebrity Awaits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/opinion/l-law-abiding-americans-find-reason-to-laud-singapore-justice-celebrity-awaits-883786.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   One thing your April 10 editorial doesn't mention is what will happen when Michael Fay is returned to the United States.

Apart from their programmatic aspects -- a narration invoking a black childhood in the 1940's in Donald E. Dillard's \"Childhood Scenes\"; references to a Caribbean island in Daniel Roumain's \"Haitian Essay,\" a musical allusion to blacks who worked at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago in Dolores White's \"Celebration\" -- the pieces were simply examples of various American styles, executed with varying degrees of expertise. Whiffs of jazz and blues and Haitian folk tunes could be heard, but neither these works nor the fourth piece -- Jonathan B. Holland's \"Martha's Waltz,\" inspired by Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" -- attested to a hyphenated identity. At times it seemed that their composers and the others at the symposium were unified only by their apparent lack of interest in black pop culture.   Defining a black American musical tradition for the concert hall was one of the symposium's preoccupations, and it was difficult not to sense that this tradition is now tenuous. Although blacks continue to play crucial roles in jazz, blues, gospel, hip-hop and other popular styles, fewer than 2 percent of orchestral musicians and perhaps only a few dozen classical composers are black. But as Eileen Southern's distinguished work \"The Music of Black Americans\" shows, a long history of black involvement with the concert hall precedes contemporary affirmative action programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Sports, Money, Politics -- A special report.; New Jersey's Sports Empire: New Fields, Hard Times","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/sports-money-politics-special-report-new-jersey-s-sports-empire-new-fields-hard.html","abstract":"  The Meadowlands sports complex, rising from swamps and garbage dumps 20 years ago, was a perfect antidote to New Jersey's image as a second-rate place with smelly air and dirty politics.

The landscape proved highly inspirational to Wordsworth, who took most of his poetic cues from nature. Living with his sister, and surrounded by a circle of poets and writers that included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Robert Southey and, later, Thomas De Quincey, Wordsworth enjoyed his most creative years. HOME AT GRASMERE: The Wordsworths and the Lakes (Collins & Brown/Trafalgar Square, $29.95) chronicles this period. Penelope Hughes-Hallett, the author of \"Jane Austen: 'My Dear Cassandra,' \" winds the story around excerpts from William Wordsworth's poems, as well as passages from Dorothy Wordsworth's journals and other letters and writings. She demonstrates that Wordsworth frequently borrowed from his sister's lyrical observations of nature and of the rustic characters who roamed the countryside. William, however, consistently underplayed Dorothy's contribution to his work. Ms. Hughes-Hallett's story, lavishly illustrated in watercolors that capture the extraordinary beauty of the Lake District, offers a glimpse into Dorothy's fanatic devotion to her brother, including her heartache over his marriage. The book is most enticing in its presentation of personal turmoil and tragedy: Coleridge's long addiction to alcohol and drugs, the misunderstandings that wrecked the close relationship between Wordsworth and Coleridge, the deaths in 1812 of two of Wordsworth's children, and, finally, Dorothy's madness. \nCLAUDIA RICCI","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Knicks Surrender Playoff Advantage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-surrender-playoff-advantage.html","abstract":"  After a long regular season in which they faced many obstacles, the Knicks were helpless this afternoon, watching television as two other teams decided their playoff fate.

In the 1950's, Australia, deciding to keep the bird to itself, banned the export of emus or emu eggs, allowing only the emu meat and its byproducts to be exported.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Habitats/Changing Apartments; Fast Find, Slow Close","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/realestate/habitats-changing-apartments-fast-find-slow-close.html","abstract":"  WHEN Mary Warlick's landlord in the Chelsea section of Manhattan demanded what she considered an unreasonable rent increase last August, she decided she'd take \"a few looks and answer some advertisements.\"   \"If I'd paid what he asked, I'd be paying enough to buy a place,\" she said, in her North Carolina accent. \"That gave me an idea.

Available just in the last two weeks to buyers in the United States, the Discovery follows a trend among luxury auto makers, including Mercedes and BMW (which recently bought Rover), to offer vehicles under $30,000 for so-called value-conscious buyers. While Rover's best-known product, the Range Rover, costs upward of $52,000, the slightly smaller Discovery starts at a mere $28,900. That price makes it competitive with other luxury compact sport utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee.   WHERE IT'S BUILT TO BE DRIVEN: The highway, of course, plus everywhere you don't drive your Accord -- through the river, over the woods, across construction sites when no workers or police officers are around. Land-Rovers are engineered to be supreme off-road vehicles. The Discovery's promoters say it can climb 45-degree angles and ford streams almost 20 inches deep. Yank a lever in the very manly center console and you double the pulling power of the V-8 engine; jerk another lever and you lock the differential, to keep power flowing equally to all wheels when you're plowing through deep mud or snow.

He was betting that he could outscore his rivals against the field, and time after time he was proved right.   For a long time now, the Capablanca policy has been successfully used by strong players, principally by such cautious souls as Tigran Petrosian, the Soviet Armenian who was world champion from 1963 to 1969. Most recently it was put into effect by the Worcester, Mass., grandmaster Ilya Gurevich in the Winter Tournament of the Marshall Chess Club, at 23 West 10th Street. In this event, which ran from Jan. 31 to Feb. 13, Gurevich went undefeated in amassing the winning 8-3 score. Against his fellow grandmasters, he drew in 12 moves with Roman Dzindzichashvili of Queens and in 22 moves with John Fedorowicz of Manhattan. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . Country . . . Points . . .

Ukraine . . . 4 . . .  Arnett . . . U.S. . . . 3 1/2   Gurevich defeated Rafail Klovsky of Ukraine with a sharp pawn-winning series of tactics in Round 2.   Against the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defense with 3 Nd2, Klovsky adopted 3 . . . Nf6 to lure the white center on with 4 e5. Quite soon, he whittled down this bastion with 8 . . . f6 9 ef Nf6 which also gave him the mobility to defend his kingside.   After 10 Ne2, it may be that Black does not need 10 . . . Qc7. A reasonable alternative is 10 . . . Bd6 11 O-O O-O 12 Bf4 Bf4 13 Nf4 Ne4 14 Qc1 Ng5 15 Ng5 Qg5 16 Ne2 Qf6.   The plan underlying 10 . . . Qc7 is that after 11 . . . Bd6, White cannot exchange off his queen bishop against the black king bishop. The purpose is further served by 14 . . . Nh5, which prepares 15 Bg3 Ng3 16 hg, thus preserving the d6 bishop to guard the slightly weak dark squares.   Gurevich remarked that his 17 Nb6!? is a new move. On 17 . . . Ra7, the black queen rook is out of play, while after 17 . . . Rb8, Gurevich boldly snatched a pawn with 18 Ba6!?   Klovsky did not knuckle under with 18 . . . ba 19 Rc6, nor fall into 18 . . . Nb4 19 Bb5 Na2 20 Rc8 Rbc8 21 Nc8 Rc8 22 Qa4! Nb4 23 Bd7, which wins a decisive pawn and simultaneously unhinges the black position. He struck back with 18 . . . Nd4 19 Nd4 ba 20 Nc8 Rbc8 21 Rc8 Rc8, when 22 Ne6? would be crunched by 22 . . . Qe5!, winning a piece.   Still, Gurevich's analysis had gone a lot farther, as his 22 Re1! showed. After 22 . . . Bb4 (22 . . . e5? 23 Nf5! gf 24 Qd5 Qf7 25 Qd6 is overwhelming for White) 23 Qg4! Qf7 24 Rd1, there was no defense by 24 . . . Re8 because of 25 Ne6 Qe6 26 Qb4.   On 24 . . . Ng7 25 Ne6! Rc4 26 Nd4 Nf5, Gurevich coolly forced the game into a pawn-ahead ending with 27 b3 Rd4 28 Rd4 Nd4 29 Qd4.   After 38 Qb7!, there was no use for the Ukrainian to go on: 38 . . . Qg8 39 f4 Kh6 40 Qg7 Qg7 41 Bg7 Kg7 42 Kf2 brings about an elementary king-and-pawn ending; 38 . . . d4 39 Bd4 Qe1 40 Kg2 accomplishes nothing because Gurevich had precisely guarded against 40 . . .
