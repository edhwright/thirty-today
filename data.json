The author, Anthony DePalma, noted one danger of the road: rockslides. We would like to warn travelers of another danger: livestock.   We were traveling on this superhighway at twilight in August, shortly after it opened. As we crested a hill, we hit a cow standing in the middle of the road. We were lucky -- my brother suffered a fractured skull and I underwent six hours of plastic and reconstructive surgery on my face back in the United States.

It's still cold and still half-French: Ottawa is one of the world's most northerly capitals, and its citizens make bilingualism sound impressively effortless. But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter. When the Rideau Canal freezes (at about 4.5 miles, it's billed as \"the world's longest skating rink\"), Ottawa looks like a Ruritanian dream capital, peopled by happy bureaucrats skating their way to work in neo-Gothic Parliament buildings. To the north, on Nepean Point, the glassy National Gallery shines like a gigantic ice sculpture. But even skating civil servants cannot subsist on mere charm, and every year they find more diversions, better restaurants, more sophisticated shopping in Ottawa. One of those diversions, Winterlude (more poetically called Bal de Neige, or Snow Ball, in French) has been providing cold-weather denial or festivity, depending on how you look at it, since 1979. Winterlude this year comes with a coda -- an extra weekend (Feb. 18 to 20) after the festival's normal 10-day span (Feb. 4 to 13). The posters enjoin, \"Don't Hibernate, Come Celebrate,\" and last year 400,000 visitors complied, taking part in more than 100 activities spread over seven sites in Ottawa and across the Ottawa River in the province of Quebec.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Alden Jones, Richard Perkins 3d","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/style/weddings-alden-jones-richard-perkins-3d.html","abstract":"  Alden Landry Jones, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Graham E.

They will read from copies of \"Ulysses,\" listen to music composed by Joyce, hear his voice on recordings, join impromptu discussions of the man and his work, watch screenings of three Joycean films and consume copious amounts of Irish soda bread and tea.   The films are: \"The Dead,\" based on Joyce's short story, directed by John Huston and starring Anjelica Huston, to be shown at 11 A.M.; \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\" screened at 2 P.M. with John Gielgud in a fiery bit as Joyce's priest, and \"James Joyce's Women,\" with Fionnula Flanagan portraying the key women in Joyce's life at 7 P.M.   Following the last film, the shop's owners, Lila and Marshall Cohen, will serve their traditional Joyce birthday cake, on which the first page of \"Ulysses\" has been reproduced in chocolate and white icing.   Everything is free. The number for more information is 644-9979.

As Mrs. Whitman sits down to draw up a budget to cut state spending and state income taxes, she will be faced with a local budgeting system that was vastly changed by her predecessor. During his term, Mr. Florio shifted billions in state aid to localities and school districts, allowing local property taxes to stabilize and, in many cases, to fall even as local spending continued to rise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN;\nRailroad Tries to Terminate Video Arcade","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/nyregion/neighborhood-report-midtown-railroad-tries-to-terminate-video.html","abstract":"As part of a major effort to clean up the Long Island Rail Road concourse in Pennsylvania Station, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is seeking to evict a video-game arcade it describes as a center for truancy and disorderly conduct.\n\nIt has urged the City Planning Commission to reject the application of the arcade, Station Break, also known as Time Out Amusement Arcade, for a new three-year permit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Commercial Property: Purchasing Rather Than Renting; A Belief in Recovery Jogs Both Buyers and Banks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/realestate/commercial-property-purchasing-rather-than-renting-belief-recovery-jogs-both.html","abstract":"  MATHIAS MEINZINGER does not consider renting a viable option.

After a mediocre regular season, in which he threw 18 interceptions, Kelly has had two strong performances in the playoffs. Troy Aikman threw just six interceptions this season. He left last week's game with a concussion. But if he is 100 percent, he is more dangerous than his counterpart. Edge: Cowboys.   RUNNING BACKS Emmitt Smith has won three straight rushing titles, but has been slowed recently by a separated shoulder. Thurman Thomas rushed for 186 yards in the A.F.C. championship game. Edge: Bills.   RECEIVERS The Bills' Billy Brooks, Andre Reed and Don Beebe do not match the explosiveness of Dallas's Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper. Edge: Cowboys.   OFFENSIVE LINE Two big, powerful groups that like crushing opposing defensive fronts. The Cowboys averaged 135.1 yards per game rushing in the regular season, and the Bills averaged 121.4 yards a game. The Cowboys' line, in particular, has provided Aikman with excellent protection. assing and just six interceptions thrown. Edge: Cowboys.   DEFENSIVE LINE Bills defensive end Bruce Smith had a strong season, with 14 sacks and 24 quarterback pressures. But his greatness has become expected, so what he did went relatively unnoticed. Cowboys defensive end Charles Haley has a bad back and if he plays, he will be limited. The Cowboys are very quick and strong and come with a ton of pressure. Edge: Bills.   LINEBACKERS Marvcus Patton and Mark Maddox have given the Bills some aggressiveness and hard hitting in the middle. Add Cornelius Bennett and Darryl Talley on the outside and you have trouble. Dallas middle linebacker Ken Norton has played much of the season with a torn bicep. Edge: Bills.   SECONDARY Cornerback Kevin Smith, whose six interceptions were the second highest in the N.F.C., and safety Thomas Everett give the Dallas unit the bite to back up their bark. Bills safety Henry Jones is a versatile player who could draw some responsibility for trying to stop Emmitt Smith. Edge: Cowboys.   SPECIAL TEAMS Buffalo's Danny Copeland is a tough kick returner who has run back a punt for a touchdown this year. And Steve Tasker is a perennial All-Pro. Dallas's Kevin Williams is a dangerous performer who returned two punts for touchdowns this year. Playing in the Georgia Dome should not have a bearing on the field-goal attempts by Buffalo's Steve Christie or Dallas's Eddie Murray. Edge: Cowboys.   COACHES Marv Levy has overcome three previous Super Bowl losses to get his team in a position for one more shot. Unfortunately, on Super Bowl Day, there is always a short-circuit with the Bills' game plan. Dallas's Jimmy Johnson excels at having his team mentally and physically prepared for big games. And in football there are none bigger than the Super Bowl. Edge: Cowboys.   OVER ALL If the Bills can stay away from turnovers, they have a shot to stay close. The Bills bring an awful lot of baggage to this game, and it will be hard for them to unload it unless they have a big lead going into the fourth quarter. That probably won't happen.

It's still cold and still half-French: Ottawa is one of the world's most northerly capitals, and its citizens make bilingualism sound impressively effortless. But the \"difficult to stir\" part is being re-evaluated, because the formerly stodgy city looks increasingly lively.\n\nIt has always been picturesque, particularly in winter. When the Rideau Canal freezes (at about 4.5 miles, it's billed as \"the world's longest skating rink\"), Ottawa looks like a Ruritanian dream capital, peopled by happy bureaucrats skating their way to work in neo-Gothic Parliament buildings.

But even skating civil servants cannot subsist on mere charm, and every year they find more diversions, better restaurants, more sophisticated shopping in Ottawa.

Mr. Gaddis's fourth novel, easier to like than his previous work, constructs a harsh, misanthropic but hilarious comedy from the language of law and litigation. GOING NATIVE, by Stephen Wright. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.) A road novel that explodes the conventions of the genre as a weird, dangerous shape-shifting protagonist remakes his identity on the way to California.

PADDY CLARKE HA HA HA, by Roddy Doyle. (Viking, $20.95.)

As if it were a show that had been put together by the man considered to be the greatest producer in Broadway's history, what appears at first blush to be just another coffeetable extravaganza proves far more substantial than its opulent illustrations and lavish packaging might suggest. Richard and Paulette Ziegfeld persuasively argue that Ziegfeld was more than just an extravagant showman; he was also an artist who \"raised the revue form progressively from burlesque to vaudeville to art.\" Ziegfeld began his legendary career in 1893 by promoting Sandow, a circus strongman, in his native Chicago. Within a few years Ziegfeld had settled in New York, where he produced more than 80 shows before his death in 1932 at the age of 65. From the start, the authors write, his shows flirted with \"the bounds of propriety\" and \"prompted talk about vulgarity,\" but in the end \"his ability to meld the best of both high and low cultures\" had permanently shaped the course of the American theater. In addition to \"The Ziegfeld Follies,\" his annual signature offering, Ziegfeld produced a wide variety of plays and musical diversions, often showcasing his many mistresses or his long-suffering second wife, Billie Burke.

There have been many earthquakes here that registered 6 or more on the Richter scale of ground motion since most of Tokyo's major highways were built. But the epicenter has always been fairly far from the city or deep underground, which lessens the quake's impact.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940130","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN;\nGum Targets for Sticky Problem","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/nyregion/neighborhood-report-midtown-gum-targets-for-sticky-problem.html","abstract":"Times have changed for chewing gum.

I just came upon it,\" Mr. Rabe explained, with a bit of inexplicable wonder at the fox-trot scene. He talked during one of the final rehearsals of the play, which opens tomorrow Off Broadway at the Promenade Theater. The dance is unusual for the fact that two men -- a cynical hoodlum and a hyperkinetic escapee from the underworld past of the two -- come together half casually and half fearfully in a moment of morbid nostalgia as the old doo-wop tune \"Angel Baby\" thumps out from the stage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"The Hatman Closeth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/nyregion/neighborhood-report-brooklyn-heights-the-hatman-closeth.html","abstract":"  For the last six years, the old commercial strip of brownstones approaching the piers on Atlantic Avenue has been the home of Vesture, a millinery store whose big front window is filled with white styrofoam heads wearing brightly colored hats, ranging from the outlandish to the simple beret, their tones dulled by the grime on the glass.

On bootleg video, just about anything by Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger sells well. Television shows with well-to-do black Americans occupy a secure niche: \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" \"A Different World\" and \"The Cosby Show.\" By contrast, while T-shirts with the \"X\" from Spike Lee's film about Malcolm X were ubiquitous, the movie itself did not find much of an audience for its sober message.   Elsewhere in black Africa, one sees sharp contrasts: In Zaire, after 20 years of economic turmoil, there is not one movie theater left in Kinshasa, the capital. The public television station relies heavily on South African nature documentaries, month-old European soccer matches, horror films and Government news. Among Zaireans, eager for any cultural stimulation from abroad, American evangelical programs have become tremendously popular. Jimmy Swaggart, dubbed in French, is a star here; his foot-stomping, hellfire-and-damnation sermons are an electrifying alternative to the straitlaced crusading by local missionaries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940130","headline":"Fingerprints-for-Welfare May Widen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/nyregion/fingerprints-for-welfare-may-widen.html","abstract":"  Louis Jeanty did something this morning that some say could save the state welfare system millions of dollars but that others see as demeaning to him.

A new architecture museum doesn't open every day, and the Heinz Center comes handsomely endowed at a time when many arts institutions are struggling to stay afloat.

Founded in 1990 with a $10 million grant from the Drue Heinz Foundation, the center opened officially in November in attractive new quarters inside the Carnegie Museum. Designed by the New York architects Ann Kalla and Pietro Cicognani, the center opens off the balcony of the Carnegie's Hall of Sculpture, a gallery scaled to the noble proportions of the Parthenon. The Heinz center's scale, by contrast, is cheerfully domestic. Entered through a three-story atrium with walls of rich Pompeian red, the galleries and study rooms will remind some visitors of the beloved Soane Museum in London.

At best, the Hall will finally tell the story of late-20th-century music from a rockers' perspective.

It was a concert dedicated not to pop melody or pop emotion, but to the immediate pleasures of kinetic rhythm.   It was, in part, an international exposition: pop-flamenco from the Spanish guitarist Rene Heredia, booming and strutting traditional drum music from Les Percussions de Guinea; a bass solo by Armand Sabal-Lecco, from Cameroon; and subtle, propulsive pieces by Uakti, who nearly stole the show with the novel sounds of homemade instruments. It was also an attempt to create a musical fusion not dominated by American ideas about pop structure; some of the lyrics were not in English, and few of them mattered as much as the momentum behind them. The music left the audience dancing, not humming tunes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Connecticut Finds Itself In the Land of the Elite","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/sports/college-basketball-connecticut-finds-itself-in-the-land-of-the-elite.html","abstract":"  Connecticut cleared another hurdle at Pittsburgh on Saturday, this time without its head coach, and the Huskies are now farther into territory never before explored by a UConn men's basketball team.

Cosby Jr. makes programming bets this week on two movies in which he is listed as an executive producer. As plain old Bill Cosby, he is also the star of each. After becoming fabulously rich with the success of NBC's \"Cosby Show\" in the 1980's, the man obviously has reached a point where he gets his way. But he can still stumble, as was evident in the fizzle of his syndicated revival of Groucho Marx's \"You Bet Your Life\" game show. These new movies, while hardly triumphs, put him on firmer footing.    In one, CBS's \"I Spy Returns,\" Thursday at 8, Mr. Cosby returns to his past, reuniting with Robert Culp for a fond tip of their hats to the NBC adventure series that ran from 1965 to 1968. In the other, \"The Cosby Mysteries\" tonight on NBC, the performer looks to the future with a sleuth format designed as the first in a series of movies, perhaps providing for Mr. Cosby the kind of neat annuity Peter Falk has found with \"Columbo.\" Not so coincidentally, \"The Cosby Mysteries\" was co-written by William Link, who created \"Columbo\" with Richard Levinson in 1971.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Do-It-Yourself Justice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/opinion/l-do-it-yourself-justice-039250.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I am shocked by \"Violence and the Bobbitts,\" your Jan. 22 editorial on the Lorena Bobbitt verdict.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940131","headline":"Conspiracy Claim Raised In Meadowlands Death","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/nyregion/conspiracy-claim-raised-in-meadowlands-death.html","abstract":"  The parents of a college sophomore who was fatally injured during a Grateful Dead concert at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1989 have asserted that their son was murdered by security guards and charged that New Jersey law-enforcement officials conspired to cover up the crime.

It was the last World Cup race before the start of the Lillehammer Olympics in Norway on Feb. 12. Myler, fifth at the 1992 Olympics, finished with a combined 1 minute 28.284 seconds, followed by Jan Bode of Germany with 1:28.400 and Doris Neuner of Austria with 1:28.501.

Jansen, of Greenfield, Wis., was clocked at 35.76 seconds in breaking his world record of 35.92 seconds, set Dec. 4 in Hamar, Norway. It was the sixth time Jansen either set or tied the world 500-meter mark.

The draft order proposes, with a few exceptions, a maximum classification lifetime of 40 years. As the federation's analysts point out, Richard Nixon set a maximum of 30 years for most classified documents, and Jimmy Carter fixed the limit at 20 years.

The result of a match between Brazil and Italy was canceled because, after a blunder by a tournament director, the players were wrongly seated. The match was not replayed, as it surely should have been, and the teams were awarded 12 victory points each out of a possible 20. The Brazilians finished first, the Italians second, and the British, who would probably have been second in normal play, a disgruntled third.   One outcome was the introduction of a device that allows this misfortune to be corrected during the session. But it is not always used, and the failure to do so caused trouble Saturday in the Flight A Grand National Teams in New York City. In the last round teams headed by Brad Moss and Jared Lilienstein, both of Manhattan, seated themselves wrongly. According to the regulations, both were given zero scores. But for this, one of them would have certainly qualified for later knockout play.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940201","headline":"When U.S. Troops Fly a U.N.

First a few words of caveat, then some compliments. \"She's the most important person in opera,\" answered another opera-minded critic stationed nearby, and in a tone that made one think toward one's physical safety.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940201","headline":"Calhoun Is Still Out","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/01/sports/sports-people-basketball-calhoun-is-still-out.html","abstract":"  Connecticut's coach, JIM CALHOUN , hospitalized with pneumonia, remained in stable condition yesterday and will miss tonight's game at Syracuse.

Loping around a circular arena in the Comme des Garcons show Friday night, they looked like part of an ensemble for a Fellini remake. Rei Kawakubo, the designer, put her clothes on actors, musicians and the Zingaro circus troupe, many of whom have short legs and rounded bellies, which protruded from under tight tiny jackets.   It was just one scene in Paris's Fellini-esque season as this month's round of men's wear showings for fall concluded with strains of music by Nino Rota lending an eerie circus lilt. Yohji Yamamoto and Ms. Kawakubo evoked the Federico Fellini of \"La Strada,\" showing men's wear in fun-house-mirror proportions in a circus-like setting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940201","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/01/nyregion/no-headline-042897.html","abstract":"  \"Let me be quite clear about this: This generation of republicans is going to see peace in Ireland.\" -- GERRY ADAMS, political head of the I.R.A.
