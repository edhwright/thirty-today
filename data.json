Methadone treatment programs were pioneered in New York City 30 years ago and have now been evaluated around the world.   They invariably show a dramatic reduction of illicit drug use and associated antisocial behavior. They also appear to reduce the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. So effective is this treatment that most physicians consider it to be unethical to offer double-blind research trials without methadone in both groups.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930427","headline":"Talking About the Riots That Tore Los Angeles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/movies/talking-about-the-riots-that-tore-los-angeles.html","abstract":"  Even after so many showings, the pictures of last year's Los Angeles riots, like those of the beating of Rodney G. King, retain their power to shock. Once again tonight, television brings back the fires, the lootings and the assaults, the sight of an American city out of control. It is an urban nightmare that won't go away.   \"L.A. Is Burning,\" a probing 90-minute \"Frontline\" report, turns the cameras on unintegrated groups of blacks, whites, Hispanic-Americans and Korean-Americans, who talk about what they saw on the screen and witnessed for themselves. They do not represent an official opinion sampling, yet they reveal the breadth and depth of the racial and class divisions in Los Angeles and -- to a lesser degree, one must hope -- throughout much of the rest of the United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930427","headline":"Sports of The Times; Sir Charles Is Gonna Be Outrageous","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-sir-charles-is-gonna-be-outrageous.html","abstract":"  EVERY time I try to type that the Knicks are going to win the playoffs, I start hearing voices.

The center of the family was Sir Michael Redgrave, son of an actor and an actress and the progenitor of an ensemble of talented actors and actresses. His younger daughter, Lynn Redgrave, tells the Redgrave story in \"Shakespeare for My Father\" at the Helen Hayes Theater. This one-woman show is a revealing and often rueful account of life without father in a stagestruck family.   During Ms. Redgrave's childhood, her parents were often absent, away on tour or, in the case of her father, at home working obsessively on his next role. The paternal slights were many, beginning with the fact that Redgrave failed to mention Lynn's birth in his journal. More attention was paid to her outgoing older siblings Vanessa and Corin. In family photographs, she says, she is \"the glum one.\" Against odds and without parental encouragement, she became a star in her own right.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930427","headline":"Gooden Gets Hit Before He Can Pitch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/sports/baseball-gooden-gets-hit-before-he-can-pitch.html","abstract":"  The telephone in Al Harazin's office rang shortly before 7 last night.

The credit insulates the poor from Social Security payroll taxes and, looking ahead, higher energy taxes. It thus acts to untax the poor who work.   But Congress is groping for ways to evade Mr. Clinton's budget shears, and there are rumblings that some members will try to grab money from the tax credit in a desperate attempt to save a favored spending program or knock down tax hikes.

U.S. Open in Polo Land    Nevertheless, after decades of decline, during which polo clubhouses were bulldozed for expressways and fields subdivided for housing developments, the sport is being played again on vast, lush lawns from Old Westbury to the Hamptons. Strings of polo ponies are being put through their paces in paddocks along Long Island's North Shore. Membership in the Meadowbrook Club, the Island's premier polo club, has risen from 14 to 42 in three years, placing it near its goal of 50 and among the 10 largest in the country. Two new polo clubs have been established on the Island in the last few years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930427","headline":"Tense U.N.

He topped one of the strongest fields in an American tourney by scoring 6 1/2-2 1/2 in the 10-man invitational event and was awarded the $2,000 first prize.   Grigory Kaidanov, a Russian emigre who lives in Lexington, Ky., took second place with 6-3.

Indeed, he was the early leader until he lost to Benjamin with two rounds to go. Here is an example of his powerful attacking play, against the Maryland international master Alexander Sherzer in Round 2 on April 14. Sherzer's chief comment was, \"I confronted him with a new move, but he discovered a strong plan against it.\"    The Aberbakh Attack against the King's Indian Defense, 5 Be2 and 6 Bg5, prevents 6 . . . e5 in view of 7 de de 8 Qd8 Rd8 9 Nd5, which wins material. It also retards the development of the white KN to keep the way clear for supporting such thrusts as g4 or h4.   If Black omits 6 . . . h6, as Sherzer does in this game, then, after 6 . . . c5 7 d5 e6 8 Qd2, he is no longer able to drive off the white QB, although he can still slip out of the pin with 8 . . . ed 9 ed Qb6.   Kaidanov's 11 Nh4 is the introduction to a formerly hotly disputed line of play that begins with 11 . . . Ne4 12 Ne4 Be4 13 f3. After 13 . . . Qb2 14 Rc1 Qd2 15 Kd2 Bd5 (15 . . . Bf5 16 Nf5 gf 17 Bd3 leaves Black in a poor endgame) 16 cd Re8 17 Rb1 Re5 18 f4 Rd5 19 Kc1 Nc6 20 Rb7 Rd4 21 Bf3 d5 22 Rd1 Rd1 23 Kd1, the consensus indicated by the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings, Vol. E, second edition is that White enjoys considerable advantage. For example, 23 . . . h6 24 Bd5 hg 25 Bf7 Kh7 26 Bg6 Kh6 27 fg Kg5 28 Rg7 will win for White.   Sherzer said: \"It was to avoid such trouble that I thought up 11 . . . Bg4. This move was not wrong. My mistakes came later.\" Kaidanov proceeded aggressively with 12 f3 Bc8 13 O-O-O!?   Sherzer said: \"The error was 17 . . . f5, opening my own king position. I should have played 17 . . . Ne5 at once.\" That way, on 18 h4, he would have been able to counterattack with 18 . . . Qb4 19 b3 b5 with reasonable chances of success.   Sherzer did indeed have counterattack in mind when he played 17 . . . f5 18 h4 fg 19 fg Ne5, but Kaidanov's attack with 20 h5! came more swiftly than he had reckoned on. After 20 . . . Rf2, Kaidanov charged to the attack with 21 hg!, ready to give up his knight with 21 . . . Rg2 to smash through with 22 Qh6! hg 23 Qh8 Kf7 24 Rh7 Kf6 25 Qg7 Kg5 26 Qh6 Kf6 27 Ne4 mate.   Sherzer had relied on keeping his opponent tied down after 21 . . . Nc4, but Kaidanov sharply broke loose with 22 gh Kh8 23 Nh4!, threatening 24 Ng6 mate. Sherzer could not play 23 . . . Kh7 because of 24 Bd3, picking up a rook, so he tried 23 . . . Nh5. But after 24 Ng6 Kh7 25 Rh5 Kg8, Kaidanov produced the annihilating 26 Na4!   On 26 . . . Qb5, there would have followed 27 Qh6 Kf7 28 Qh7 Kf6 29 Qe7 Kg6 30 Rg5 Kh6 31 Qg7 mate. But also after 26 . . . Nd2 27 Nb6 Re2 28 Na8, Sherzer had no way of putting up a fight, 28 . . . Bg4 meaning nothing after 29 Rg5. Thus, he gave up.   In last week's column, the diagram should have shown the black king at h8 and a black pawn at f5.

The play had its acclaimed New York premiere a year ago at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. The director for television (stage director Christopher Ashley seems to have become a nonperson in the publicity credits) is George C. Wolfe, who is represented on Broadway with \"Jelly's Last Jam\" and, in previews, \"Angels in America.\"   Tapping into a journalistic vein that in literature goes back at least as far as John Dos Passos, the television version of Ms. Smith's one-woman show allows her to embody 19 characters, male and female, black and white, young and old, all of them caught up in the Crown Heights tragedy that left two people dead. The dialogue is taken verbatim from interviews conducted by Ms. Smith and, for an Angela Davis segment, Thulani Davis. The acting sections are framed in black-and-white photographs of the real events, overlaid with music ranging from black hip-hop to traditional Jewish chants. The production is striking.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930428","headline":"Shoemaker Hopes for Rare Derby Double Feat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/28/sports/horse-racing-derby-notebook-shoemaker-hopes-for-rare-derby-double-feat.html","abstract":"  Bill Shoemaker rode 8,833 winners during his 41 years as a jockey, and four of them were winners of the Kentucky Derby.

Madison, the state capital and the home of the University of Wisconsin, is more an intellectual and political hotbed than a cultural center. The Madison Opera, in particular, has been a provincial enterprise, scarcely remembered from a critic's days at the university in the 1960's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930428","headline":"Many Questions Raised in Texas On Murder Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/28/us/many-questions-raised-in-texas-on-murder-case.html","abstract":"  Gov.

The city's comparison of police and sanitation workers' pay cavalierly ignores three weighty components of sanitation worker income: holiday pay, night shift differential and sanitation's double-time rate for overtime. These, coupled with gain-sharing bonuses, enable sanitation workers to earn greater annual income than police officers.   While you consider this methodology \"a strange way to calculate wages,\" economists, arbitrators and even city negotiators normally factor in the calculations used by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to determine total earnings.

Mr. Zimerman had the technique and control for Schubert's easeful spans of sound, but the argument went awry at several crucial points.   At the outset of the first movement, for example, the main theme foundered amid unnecessary spells of rubato: the bass trill in the eighth bar, which should rumble beneath an even surface, failed to play its unsettling role. Then, later in the movement, Mr. Zimerman undercut major events with inexpressive articulation: the forte statement of the main theme did not roll in with the right leisurely grandeur (the tempo was slightly too fast throughout), and the momentous triple-piano re-entry of this same theme in the development slid past without a shiver of epiphany.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Measuring Warming","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/opinion/l-measuring-warming-043193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Vice President Gore may know more about global warming than the President (\"Mr. Clinton, Meet Mr. Gore,\" editorial, April 20), but the whole Administration should be aware of what is known.

There were no real surprises, therefore, in the Brooklyn Philharmonic concert that Dennis Russell Davies conducted on Saturday evening: just an acknowledgement of a long-standing blurring of borders and the suggestion, if only subliminally, that compartmentalization makes no sense.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"PEOPLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/style/IHT-people-93513539097.html","abstract":"A silver dog-collar given to a Scottish noble family by Bonnie Prince Charlie sold for £41,800 ($66,044) byChristie's at a crowded sale atFingask Castle in Rait, Scotland.The prince- whose real name wasCharles Edward Stuart-gave dog","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Experts Urge Emergency Care for Stroke Victims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/us/experts-urge-emergency-care-for-stroke-victims.html","abstract":"  Emergency treatment should be summoned for people with symptoms of a stroke because steps to limit brain damage are most effective within the first six hours after the symptoms begin, medical experts said yesterday.

The actors Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro also appeared.   The concert was recorded for broadcast on May 9 on Fox. Despite delays and retakes that prolonged the event to four hours, the concert lived up to Ms. Franklin's magnificent voice. Her own recent tours have been frustrating teases, offering only hints of what she can do amid second-rate pop. Perhaps by adding competition, \"Duets\" brought out Ms. Franklin's improvisational genius. She can summon the agility of jazz, the pain of the blues, the sultriness of pop and the fervor of gospel, and while her voice is smokier now than it was in her 1960's heyday, she has all the range she needs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"2 Dinkins Rivals, Giuliani and Stein, Woo Donors at Fund-Raisers for Mayor Race","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/nyregion/2-dinkins-rivals-giuliani-and-stein-woo-donors-at-fund-raisers-for-mayor-race.html","abstract":"  In elegant hotels seven blocks apart, the two leading contenders to unseat Mayor David N.

Such a consumption tax, which is paid for by the manufacturers at each stage of production, and ultimately passed on to consumers, can partially replace income and other taxes.   A European-style VAT can be progressive, with low rates for widely used basic goods and services, and high rates for luxury and unhealthy goods (tobacco, alcohol, gasoline). In the European Community, it is a requirement for all members to have a progressive VAT (varying from 6 to 16 and 36 percent). To ease the burden on the poor, certain items, such as food, housing and other necessities, can be excluded from VAT, as they are presently excluded from state and local sales taxes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930429","headline":"Seesaw Ninth Tilts Langston's Way, Leaving Abbott in Lurch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/29/sports/baseball-seesaw-ninth-tilts-langston-s-way-leaving-abbott-in-lurch.html","abstract":"  Buck Rodgers, the Angels' manager, visited the mound with two out in the ninth inning and it appeared that his starter, Mark Langston, was finally done.
