Throughout its long and prosperous career, Reader's Digest has easily survived the scorn of a few for the heapings of human interest, health hints, instant inspiration and all-purpose advice that held the affections of so many. Television, of course, has displaced magazines in hearts and minds around the world and given critics an even bigger target for their disdain. So this evocation of the earlier mass merchandiser is a sort of pop hommage.   Tonight's sampling of Great Hits From America's Great Magazine is true to the Digest spirit.

When the first concerts sold out, the church let Mr. Nygaard add a second series.   Across town, at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on the Upper East Side, and in Greenwich Village at the Church of the Ascension, new series of choral concerts have sprung up because the churches' music directors wanted to show off their choirs to the public.

The play that bears his name, a bafflingly amphibious blend of history and tragedy, was seldom performed in this century until relatively recently.

The great interest of Robin Phillips's emotionally gripping, if somewhat muddled, production at the Stratford Festival here is that it makes John its unconditional center and, in doing so, presents him as a disturbingly pertinent statesman for our times. \"Macbeth\" and \"Richard III,\" with their portraits of raveningly ambitious, Machiavellian heads of state, were the perfect choices for politically slanted revivals in the paranoiac heyday of the late 60's and early 70's, the years of Johnson and Nixon. \"King John,\" on the other hand, has vital resonance for an age that often sees its politicians less as monsters than mediocrities, distanced from greatness by all-too-pedestrian frailties.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"Another Despotic Creed Seeks to Infiltrate the West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/opinion/IHT-another-despotic-creed-seeks-to-infiltrate-the-west.html","abstract":"Muslim fundamentalism is fast becoming the chief threat to global peace and security as well as a cause of national and local disturbance through terrorism.

The scores in Texas were depressing for the Yankees. For the third straight evening, the Rangers defeated the Yankees and prevented them from moving into first place.

At the Academy on Tuesday night, the crowd sustained the tune of \"Let Love Rule\" while Mr. Kravitz demanded more gusto. \"Ya gotta mean it!\" he shouted, a particularly odd request from a performer so dedicated to posing.    The 28-year-old Mr. Kravitz is a proud throwback. He reclaims rock from the late 1960's and early 1970's, and he steals only from the best: the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Marvin Gaye. (Meanwhile, the opening act for his tour, Raging Slab, revives the Southern hard-rock of the mid-1970's.) Yet Mr. Kravitz still lives in the music-video era, and for him the golden age of rock means the right props and costumes: old guitars and keyboards, bell-bottomed pants, untamed hairdos and postures of artless sincerity, perhaps learned from repeated viewings of the \"Woodstock\" videotape. \"We're just gonna play,\" he said as one tune stretched out, alluding to a late-1960's Hendrix disclaimer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/nyregion/metro-digest-430393.html","abstract":"  ATTORNEY GENERAL ABRAMS TO RESIGN   The New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, his hopes of winning a Senate seat dashed last year and his prospects for the governorship apparently stymied, abruptly announced that he would resign the post that he has held for 15 years to become a partner in a Manhattan law firm at the end of the year.
