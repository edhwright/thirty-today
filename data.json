He has acted as his own general manager for football operations, and has run the college draft as well. But the issue flared after the 1991 season when he fired Mike Shanahan, his offensive coordinator, in a disagreement over how the offense should be run. Even though Reeves had hired Shanahan and given him the title, he didn't want him to have control.    The owner: Pat Bowlen was angered by the Shanahan move and insisted Shanahan stay. But Reeves, whose title was vice president/head coach, pointed to his contract. Bowlen had to back down and announced, \"By virtue of his contract, Dan has the right to hire and fire coaches.\" It was apparent to many people then that Bowlen was not going to allow either Reeves or that contract to remain in force.   Dealing with the superstar: In Denver, there has been only one: John Elway. His relationship with Reeves, although rocky, was successful: Elway, the nervous, impatient star, and Reeves, the organized, no-nonsense pedagogue.   Elway has denied, as did Bowlen, that he was responsible for Reeves's departure. A few weeks before Reeves was dismissed, Elway suggested publicly that the coach should delegate authority, that he had taken too much on himself. And Elway was known to object to Reeves's firing of Shanahan. Possible Problems Reeves Will Face in New York  Dealing with George Young and the owners: The owners won't interfere. Reeves can do all the talking he wants as far as the college draft and picking free agents. But he won't have the final say. That is George Young's call. Tom Boisture, the player personnel director, oversees the draft and will listen to Reeves. Reeves has told Young that he doesn't expect the sort of control he exercised in Denver. Still, how will he handle it if he doesn't get his way?   The media: On a typical Wednesday, Reeves will be faced by more print and electronic media types than he saw before any game in Denver, except for the conference championship. His Southern hospitality will be taxed, but he seems to be able to handle crowds now. After all, he has been to the Super Bowl.   Dealing with veterans: There are no prima donas on the Giants' offense, no one who is as dominant as Elway in Denver. Reeves will control the offense and its players. If he chooses Jeff Hostetler as his quarterback, which seems likely, he will find a performer who tends to whine if things don't go his way. But Hoss, with the mechanical skills to run a Reeves-type varied offense, will do his bidding. Lawrence Taylor? The most famous Giant on defense, if he decides to return, is unlikely to play the defining role he enjoyed throughout his career. Still, Reeves probably will incorporate Taylor's style into the new defensive schemes. It is hard to imagine Reeves losing control of the defense the way Ray Handley did.   Motivation: By becoming the coach, Reeves immediately brings more authority to the role than Handley. The Giants still like to think of themselves as the Super Bowl team, and in Reeves they have a coach who wears more Super Bowl rings than anyone else -- eight (two as the Cowboys' option halfback, three as a Cowboys' assistant, three as the Broncos' head coach).

Moliere, who certainly recognized a good part when he wrote it, chose to play the title role in the original production in 1671. Since then, \"Scapin\" has come to be accepted as a most durable farce and one that can be subjected to open interpretation, as in \"Scapino,\" the mirthful Jim Dale-Frank Dunlop Italianate variation. At the Classic Stage Company through Feb. 21, Andrei Belgrader gives the play a freewheeling workout, updating it with contemporary references and underscoring it with a harsher line.   As always, \"Scapin\" needs an agile scamp, in this case, Stanley Tucci, a quick-change clown with a sly deadpan and a gift for mimicry. With more malevolence than is customary in the role, he puts the intricate plot in motion and then casually sidesteps into improvisation. Interrupting the play, he converses with theatergoers, scrambles through the seats and then settles back waiting for the comedy to continue. But without him onstage, the show takes a long pause.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930127","headline":"Historical Society Puts Up Artworks As Loan Collateral","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/arts/historical-society-puts-up-artworks-as-loan-collateral.html","abstract":"  The financially beleaguered New-York Historical Society has put up $3 million worth of artworks from its collection as collateral to secure a $1.5 million commercial loan it says it needs to survive.

This is admittedly a difficult bidding situation, since Blackwood is of little value when holding a void suit. In experienced partnerships North's second bid should be a jump to four clubs, which is a splinter bid even though partner has bid the suit.

The designs include a leather shoe with a disposable and replaceable sole, a national monument in the form of a nuclear-waste repository and fishing piers modified for people in wheelchairs.   \"The show is not a competition but a survey of what was out there,\" said Dr. Stephan Klein, a professor of interior design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, which sponsored the show with Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility/New York, a nonprofit group devoted to forums on social issues. In the last 24 years, he said, \"Republicans eviscerated architecture from social programs.\" Last year, 400 schools of architecture and design around the world were invited to participate; 196 responded.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930128","headline":"Off-Duty Probation Officer Slain in Queens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/nyregion/off-duty-probation-officer-slain-in-queens.html","abstract":"  An off-duty probation officer was shot and killed Tuesday night as he was getting into his car in Queens in what may have been a robbery, the police said yesterday.

His son, RICHARD ROBERTS, 44, succeeded him. The announcement was made at a service in the Christ Chapel on the campus of Oral Roberts University.    Mr. Roberts, who turned 75 on Sunday, cited no specific reason for his action, but his office said he had a heart attack in October and had heart surgery last month.    He will not, however, disappear from either the campus or the public eye. He will remain as chancellor of the university and plans to continue his television program, his healing ministry and his travels. He has acknowledged that the university has encountered financial problems in recent years.    In 1987, he caused a sensation when he announced that God would \"call him home\" if he did not raise $8 million in short order for a medical missionary scholarship program at the university. Three months later, he said he had accomplished his goal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930128","headline":"Labor Secretary Says Extension Of Jobless Benefits Is on the Table","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/us/labor-secretary-says-extension-of-jobless-benefits-is-on-the-table.html","abstract":"  In the face of huge layoffs at companies like Sears Roebuck, Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, the Clinton Administration is preparing to extend the unemployment benefits of the 1.7 million Americans now receiving them, Labor Secretary Robert B.

Punk and cabaret aren't styles that readily overlap, but as ends of a spectrum they actually share some ground: a directness of emotion, an alienation from contemporary currents, an overindulgence in theatricality. Gavin Friday lives at the vortex between the two. His song \"Melancholy Baby,\" from his recent solo album \"Adam 'n' Eve\" (Island), isn't the pop standard, but a self-conscious hat-tip that includes the lines \"Zing zing a zang go the strings of my heart/Cling cling a clang I'll never let you part.\" Tonight at 9:15; there is a $6 cover charge.
