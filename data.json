The cells, which give rise to progenitor cells -- both of which are needed for reconstitution -- are precursors of the blood-forming machinery and immune system. They develop into disease-fighting marrow and fully developed red-blood cells that carry oxygen, as well as white cells that combat pathogens, and platelets that help clotting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"Opposition Rises to 42d St. Trolley, Calling It a Streetcar Named Trouble","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/nyregion/neighborhood-report-midtown-opposition-rises-42d-st-trolley-calling-it-streetcar.html","abstract":"  A flier headlined \"Save the M-42 crosstown\" warns bus riders that the planned 42d Street trolley would eliminate one of the city's oldest bus routes.

Their basic quarrel: Since the route is already covered by mass transit (the M-42 and M-104 buses and the Grand Central-Times Square subway shuttle and the No. 7 line), why spend an estimated $135 million for yet another system?","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"They're Off and Watching!","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/style/evening-hours-they-re-off-and-watching.html","abstract":"  It's high season for horses and fans at Saratoga Race Course, Aug. 6.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"The Cap of Not Much Hope","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/books/the-cap-of-not-much-hope.html","abstract":"  ON THE CONTRARY Being the Life of a Famous Rebel, Soldier, Traveller, Explorer, Reader, Builder, Scribe, Latinist, Lover and Liar.

If they're on a tight budget, they still have to look for bargains.

Threading through a phalanx of small coastal islands, they saw gradually revealed the violet and blue-tinged mountains of Mount Desert rising from the mist and the sea.    Except for sailors and cruise-ship passengers, visitors today approach Mount Desert Island by car, missing out on this perspective. The panoramic view from Cadillac Mountain, a first stop for many, reveals suddenly and surprisingly the islands that surround Mount Desert Island like a carelessly tossed necklace of dark green beads. But the attractions of Acadia National Park and the villages around it are so numerous that these outer islands usually remain a tantalizing mystery. In fact, they are not difficult to reach, and they offer a glimpse into a life that has nearly vanished, where children play unfettered and adults are peacefully tuned to the tides and the mail boats.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"Finnish Folk Music With a Texas Twist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/nyregion/playing-neighborhood-greenwich-village-finnish-folk-music-with-texas-twist.html","abstract":"  IN 1971 Philip Page, a lifelong resident of Austin, Tex., heard a band from Finland called Wig-Wam.

Are lay persons allowed to attend Mass and other services at the Benedictine monastery in Solesmes, France, to hear the Gregorian chant? Where is the nearest rail station and can one stay in Solesmes itself? -- Thomas E. Crepeau, Columbus, Ohio A.  The monks of Solesmes are celebrated for their scholarly work on the Gregorian chant and, starting in the 1800's, for their revision of liturgical works. Their abbey, St.-Pierre, was founded in the 11th century and is between Le Mans and Angers.    If you are in Paris, you can arrive in time for the main Mass, offered daily at 9:45 A.M. Seating is limited and cannot be reserved, so it's a good idea to be on hand at 9:30 when the doors open for the Mass, sung by about 80 Benedict monks. There four other daily services, or canonical hours -- at 1, 1:50, 5 and 8:30 -- at which time you can hear Gregorian chant.    Taking the T.G.V. from Gare Montparnasse at 7:15 A.M. on any day but Sunday will get you to Sable-sur-Sarthe by 8:30. (On Sunday, the T.G.V. also leaves at 7:15 but, because of a layover in Le Mans, does not get to Sable-sur-Sarthe until 9:56.) The round-trip fare is $89.50 in first class, $59.80 second class, calculated at 5.25 francs to the dollar.   From the Sable train station to Solesmes, a two-mile trip, you can take a 15-minute ride on the No. 8 bus ($3.25 round trip), take a taxi ($7.25 one way), rent a bicycle or walk. Bike rentals at the station are $8.40 for a half a day or $10.50 for a full day.    There are several trains a day in each direction between Sable and Paris. Frequency depends on the day of the week and the season, so it is best to check first. The last train back to Paris leaves at 6:52 P.M.   If you plan to stay in Solesmes overnight, your choices are very limited. The only hotel in town, the Grand (telephone 43.95.45.10, fax 43.95.22.26), faces the abbey; its rate is $77 for a double. The Grand has a restaurant and charges $8 a person for breakfast.   Another option is to lodge at the Abbey of St.-Pierre, which is for men only, or at Ste.-Cecile, its female counterpart. Ste.-Cecile is open to women, couples and families. Most rooms have two beds or more. Reservations must be made far ahead (especially for religious holidays) by calling 43.95.45.02 or by writing to Soeur Hoteliere, Abbaye Ste.-Cecile, 72300 Solesmes, France. While the announced rate is $30.50 for bed and three meals, visitors may donate more. Note that lodging is closed to guests from Oct. 1 to Palm Sunday (a week before Easter). Services, with female singers, are similar to those at St.-Pierre.    St.-Pierre is open only to male visitors, and they are asked to respect the rules of relative silence (no radios and television). They may eat in the refectory. Visitors have their own rooms and bathrooms are down the hall. Up to 35 visitors can be accommodated, and lodging is open all year. For reservations, call 43.95.03.08, fax 43.95.68.79 or write Pere Hotelier, Abbaye St.-Pierre, 72300 Solesmes, France. Since there is no imposed rate, guests decide how much they wish to pay.   There are also hotels in Sable: the Escu du Roy (43.95.90 31), where a double is $47.60, and the Hotel-Grill, where a double is $42. Breakfast is $5.30 a person at both places. Learning to Make Pasta  Q.  I plan to be in Rome and Florence in September and would like to attend some demonstration classes for making pasta. Do you know of any schools that hold classes or demonstrate the preparation of a variety of pastas? -- Edgar Holton, San Francisco A.  Your timing is not quite ideal since September in Italy is still considered a holiday month. In addition, none of the schools surveyed in Rome and Florence offers a course specifically in the making of pasta. Most have courses that are broader in scope and that begin in mid-October when the weather is cooler.   But all is not lost. There is at least one school in Rome and one school in Florence that said it could arrange a private lesson in September with a chef who speaks English.    The school in Rome, which calls itself Atavolaconlochef (Atthetablewiththechef), can set up a private lesson in pasta-making, according to Maria Teresa Meloni, a spokeswoman.    Ms. Meloni said that the lesson, lasting three hours, would cover all the basics: making the dough for egg noodles, semolina and durum wheat noodles as well as making such different kinds of pasta as spaghetti and tagliatelle and even making stuffed pasta, like ravioli or tortellini. You would also learn to prepare very basic sauces. The cost is $196, computed at the rate of 1,529 lire to the dollar.   Although the school (60 Via dei Gracchi, 00192 Rome) does not reopen until October, you can leave a message; telephone and fax (06) 3203402 or telephone (06) 3222096.    In Florence, the Cordon Bleu is willing to set up a private five-hour lesson that covers the basics of pasta-making and cost $249. The school is at 55 Via di Mezzo, 50121 Florence; telephone (055) 2345468.  Cruising in Germany  Q.  Can one take a boat on the Main from Wurzburg to Mainz. -- Tom Wurl, New York, N.Y. A.  There is no regular service linking these two cities. There is, though, a cruise from Sept. 10 to 17 from Wurzburg to Rudesheim (which is 21 miles beyond Mainz). The line, Scylla Tours, has no other ships schedued on this route in 1994. Information: the Geriberz Reiseburo, 15 Etzelstrasse, 5430 Wettingen, Switzerland; telephone (41-56) 270101, fax (41-56) 272883.   The boat, the Switzerland II, stops in Mainz for two and a half hours. Should passengers wish to end their trip in Mainz, they must pay the full fare to Rudesheim -- a minimum of $1,026 for a stateroom. The fare includes day sightseeing trips in Wurzburg, Gmunden, Wertheim, Frankfurt, Mainz and Rudesheim.    Finding a Japanese Soldier    Q.  I am planning a trip to Japan next fall and would like to find the record of a Japanese soldier who fought in the Philippines in World War II. I found his good-luck banner in my father's mementos and would like to return it to the family. To whom might I write for information?  -- Louise Steinman, Los Angeles   A.  A records center at the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare maintains data on four million war dead and missing. For information, send details on when, where and how the banner was found as well as a picture of it. Since banners bear presenters' names and messages, this information can be especially valuable if the name of the person being sought is a common one.

This field of study maintains that characteristics such as race, sex, religion, profession, economic status and personality type are likely to influence views that may be favorable to a particular side in a court case and that these \"types\" can be concentrated on a jury during the selection process.   Proponents of the scientific selection of jurors, including Mr. Tieger, rationalize their work by suggesting that they are looking for open-minded jurors who will fairly evaluate their client's case. The disingenuous nature of this argument is demonstrated by Mr. Tieger's role in a civil case in which a successfully selected jury awarded $7.25 million to the plaintiff in an accidental shooting. Mr. Tieger, who worked for the plaintiff, acknowledges that in preparation for the trial he had conducted research into what types of jurors would most likely hold negative views toward the defendant's actions. Clearly the goal of the selection process is to obtain the most favorably biased jury possible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"Bucks County","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/travel/l-bucks-county-839736.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: \"What's Doing in Bucks County\" by Barbara Crossette (June 12) brought back many happy memories, especially the picture of lovely Black Bass Hotel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/books/in-short-fiction.html","abstract":"AUSTRALIAN NOVEL \nWHITE EYE \nBy Blanche d'Alpuget.\nSimon & Schuster, $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"What's Wrong With a Voluntary Health Plan; Tax Credit Is Fairer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/opinion/l-what-s-wrong-with-a-voluntary-health-plan-tax-credit-is-fairer-960756.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Re \"The Senate's Promising Health Bill\" (editorial, Aug. 3): Senator George J.

He scattered his photographers throughout the land, and in the early 1940's he sent John Collier Jr., Jack Delano and Russell Lee to work in New Mexico. FAR FROM MAIN STREET. Three Photographers in Depression-Era New Mexico: Russell Lee, John Collier Jr., Jack Delano (Museum of New Mexico, paper, $22.50) provides a good introduction to these photographers, whose humanistic vision conjures up an era when artists still believed in the redemptive value of a slice of life. Jack Delano covered the railroads for a project to promote the industrial war effort, producing stark portraits of workers and surreal images of rail cars crossing the desert. Lee, responding to Stryker's request to find a \"town being born,\" focused on Pie Town, N.M., where he recorded community sings, farm folk and barrooms, faith in the basic goodness of man fairly shining through his black-and-white images. Collier, who had spent a lot of time in New Mexico and felt at home there, had access to the Spanish-speaking communities in the northern part of the state. His photographs of adobe buildings, religious artifacts and domestic scenes reflect his respect and appreciation for that culture. Although their mission was to provide data about daily lives, all three photographers also produced work of transcendent grace and beauty. The photographs are richly reproduced in \"Far From Main Street,\" but sometimes are too crowded on the page, and it is often harder than it should be to figure out whose photographs you're looking at.

There, the peaks of the Eastern Main Ranges (which include the 20 highest summits in the region) border the road like an endless Rockette kickline -- 11,620-foot Mount Temple, 11,400-foot Mount Kitchener, 11,030-foot Mount Edith Cavell, each one more spectacularly shaped than the last, with huge icefields at their backs and glaciers slung round their shoulders like stoles; the alpine lakes the glaciers feed are wells of almost unnaturally bright color (the day I saw Lake Louise, it was Margarita green), and the woods are crawling with bears (I saw nine, and encountered another while walking alone on a roadside near Athabasca Falls).\n\nThe price of the trip was nearly as amazing as the scenery -- $280, including lodging, transportation in the Rockies and meals.  Getting $1.32 in Canadian money for every United States dollar I exchanged only partly explains the rock-bottom price. The real savings came because I booked a spot on the Rocky Express, a 15-seat van that wended its way among the mountains, staying overnight at hostels (costing $6 to $12 a bunk) where space for passengers had been reserved. The farther north we got, the more rustic the hostels were -- on two nights we had no electricity and on four nights, no running water -- which is why the van also had to stop at restaurants where passengers used the bathrooms to brush their teeth. Between hostels and ablution facilities, the van made stops for scenic overlooks, hiking trails, horseback riding, mountain biking and river rafting -- and, of course, every time someone saw a bear. The cost of the van travel was $102; food, hostels and activities were extra -- but obviously, not much extra.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"Recycling Catches On in More Ways Than One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/nyregion/recycling-catches-on-in-more-ways-than-one.html","abstract":"  Every weekday morning the Metro-North commuters flowing across the platforms of Grand Central Terminal leave thousands of newspapers in recycling baskets.

The Novaks drive around the American heartland investigating strange sightings and inexplicable \"manifestations\" reported by backcountry farmers, suburban housewives and small-town shopkeepers. Their most impressive findings -- the thick circles of smooth blackish glass that appear from time to time in someone's cornfield or front yard -- resemble thousands of other circles found around the world. While these inert objects are hard to explain away, no one seems to take them very seriously; they are apparently too common to rouse much fear or even curiosity. The young Cornell believes in U.F.O.'s to the same extent that he believes in his father. His mother disappeared when he was 4 years old; according to his father, she was abducted in a spaceship by aliens.   Having set up this oddly dysfunctional family and its slightly anomalous near-future world, Mr. Reed tosses the first of his bombshells. One otherwise ordinary summer evening the sky changes permanently: the stars disappear, to be replaced by an \"everted\" image of the surface of the earth as it might appear reflected on the inside of a vast mirrored ball. Fifty miles up, this illusion ends; the universe has not changed, only our earthbound view of it. The Change, as people come to call it, triggers a change in Cornell's relationship with his father. Instead of being hailed as a prophet in his own time, Nathan Novak is revealed as a pathetic old man whose lifelong obsession with aliens provides no insight into the new reality. His rambling, contradictory explanations of the Change, patently out of sync with the facts, become increasingly embarrassing to his son; when Cornell learns the sad truth about his mother's disappearance, he leaves home -- and encounters the second of Mr. Reed's bombshells.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940814","headline":"In the Region/New Jersey;\nWarehouse-Distribution Center Projects Picking Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/realestate/in-the-regionnew-jersey-warehousedistribution-center-projects.html","abstract":"DEVELOPERS of warehouses and distribution centers, who went through recessionary dog days after the mid-80's construction boom, are building again in New Jersey, focusing on projects for specific tenants.\n\nSeveral large projects under way or about to start across the state total more than four million square feet, said David T.

Both musicians approach their work with an energy and spirit that keep their performances involving. But that aside, they seem to live at different ends of the interpretive spectrum.    Ms. McDermott tends to work within conventional notions about Classical style, where she finds sufficient leeway to make her case. In a consistently graceful account of Mozart's Piano Quartet in E flat (K. 493), she exploited the breadth of the music's possibilities, sometimes giving the piano line an almost vocal shape and coloration and sometimes playing with a more aggressive pianistic sparkle. The Orion players matched her approach move for move, particularly in the finale, where the interplay between lines is strongest and where the character of the music is the most changeable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"Train Wreck in Caucasus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/world/train-wreck-in-caucasus.html","abstract":"  A passenger train smashed into a parked freight train on a stretch of track where the signals were broken, killing 12 people and injuring 20, officials said today.

It's surprising that it has taken so long, considering that the hybrid called bhangra, a mix of harvest festival music from Punjab in Northern India and reggae, rap, techno and club music, actually comes from England. Like hip-hop, bhangra has become a way for a minority culture -- in this case, Indians born in Britain -- to find identity and empowerment through its own music.   XLNC (pronounced \"excellency\") is among bhangra's youngest upstarts. On Thursday, its dance music, powered by the adrenaline tempos of the two-headed dholak drum and the larger, congalike dhol drum, insured that the dance floor remained a sea of waving arms and airborne dollar bills the entire night. Harbajan Singh Talwar and Dave Singh sang mostly in Punjabi, but also in Hindi and English, closing almost every song with rousing chants of \"Hey!\" Mr. Talwar, in particular, had a resonant voice that soared majestically over the band's good-time grooves.

When Sabine Kupferberg reached 40, she decided she was tired of performing and moved over to coaching with the Nederlands Dans Theater, where she had danced for 15 years. This week Miss van Hamel and Miss Kupferberg return to the stage at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., for performances with the Nederlands Dans Theater 3, familiarly known as N.D.T.3.    The brainchild of Jiri Kylian, the choreographer and director of the Nederlands Dans Theater, the troupe is a company of four dancers who made names for themselves but then arrived at an age considered old for ballet. There tends to be more leeway for modern dancers. Ballet today, though, requires a level of pyrotechnical skill that is beyond the reach of most dancers in their 40's and older.  But experience burnishes and deepens performing skills. And so Mr. Kylian, who founded the company in 1991, invited choreographers to create pieces tailored to those dancers' well-honed gifts. It was \"an idea\" as much as a company, he said in a statement at the company's first performance, a project that would make use of \"the specific quality and understanding of the interpreter at this very point of his or her life, not before and not after.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"Clubs Stand to Lose More Than They'll Save","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/sports/baseball-clubs-stand-to-lose-more-than-they-ll-save.html","abstract":"  On an industry-wide basis, the 28 major league clubs will lose more money in lost gate receipts, concessions and parking ($300 million) than they will save in players' salaries they don't pay ($260 million) if the strike wipes out the rest of the season.

(AP)   TENNIS  Frazier Defeats Friend in Slims Tourney  Amy Frazier defeated a childhood friend, Ann Grossman, by 6-1, 6-3 yesterday to win the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles in a baseline struggle of little-known Americans. Frazier's fifth career title and first this year was worth $80,000, her biggest payday in four years as a pro. The victory by the 21-year-old Frazier completed her best week in a major tournament. She didn't drop a set in six matches, including victories over sixth-seeded Anke Huber and a quarterfinal upset of top-seeded Conchita Martinez.

It attempts to portray not the story of the Who, but the history of this seminal British band's live performances.   Nearly 20 years before the rise of the music video, the Who was turning rock-and-roll into drama with exploding flash pots, flamboyant performance techniques and outrageous mod costumes (frilly shirts, flared pants, two-tone shoes, jackets with five-inch side vents). However, over the course of the documentary's 15 live clips spanning the band's 30-year history, Pete Townshend's guitar-bashing turns from an angry response to a routine one; Roger Daltrey's stage presence becomes a function of the size of the circles he can twirl his microphone in; the bassist John Entwistle's movements narrow to just his hands and lips, and Keith Moon's face slowly disappears behind a growing stack of drums until he vanishes altogether.

It is built of a hundred billion nerve cells sheathed and nourished by a trillion supporting cells. And projecting from every neuron is a delicate communications cable called an axon that splits and branches and splits again, like the crown of a great spreading oak, allowing that one nerve cell to cry out through synaptic conduits to a thousand others of its kind. All told, there are more synaptic connections encased within a single skull than there are stars flung across the universe.    Neuroscientists who study the developing brain have long sought to understand just how that extraordinary neuronal circuitry gets wired up in the first place. They have struggled to identify the signals responsible for axonal guidance -- for steering the tender and tentative axon of a young nerve cell through the pandemonium of the growing brain and over to its appropriate target. Once the tip of the axon has found its correct resting spot, it can begin forming synaptic linkups with as many neurons in the neighborhood as it needs to contact to get its message across. And only with its axons in place can a brain begin to register the world around it: to see, to think, to feel, to know itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940816","headline":"Review/Fashion; Exotic Swimsuits That Shape the Body","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/style/review-fashion-exotic-swimsuits-that-shape-the-body.html","abstract":"  Romancing the swimsuit has helped Gottex build its position as a world power in beach clothes.

Can you hold?\"   The Senator's phones are ablaze from dawn until well past dark, with the answering machine collecting at least 200 more messages overnight. Clogged phone lines are one price that Mr. Breaux and some of his fellow legislators pay for staking out an independent position on what many say is the most heavily lobbied issue in the nation's history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940816","headline":"Haiti Refugees And U.S. Force Clash in Cuba","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/world/haiti-refugees-and-us-force-clash-in-cuba.html","abstract":"  In a sign of rising tensions at an American naval base in Cuba holding Haitian refugees, 20 United States military police officers and 45 Haitians were injured in a four-hour melee involving hundreds of refugees on Saturday, the Pentagon said today.    Two of the 20 American troops who were injured by rocks, bottles, cans and tent stakes thrown in the fight remain hospitalized with cuts and bruises, said a Pentagon spokesman, Col. Doug Kennett. All the injuries, including those to the 45 Haitians, were minor, Colonel Kennett said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940816","headline":"1944: The Fourth Front : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/opinion/IHT-1944-the-fourth-front-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ROME - [From our New York edition:] Thousands of American, French and British troops, forming a fourth front against Adolf Hitler's withering strength, drove northward through southern France tonight [Aug. 15] after a sea and air-borne invasion early this","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940816","headline":"Don't Be Seduced by Medisave","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/opinion/don-t-be-seduced-by-medisave.html","abstract":"  Medisave, the proposal for medical savings accounts, is a bad idea that has crept into the health-care bills proposed by the Democratic leadership in the House and by Bob Dole, the minority leader, in the Senate. Medisave would allow people to save money by purchasing health insurance policies with very high deductibles and then invest the savings in tax-free accounts.    Advocates say Medisave can help control health-care costs through consumer choice rather than heavy-handed government regulation. Catastrophic coverage requires consumers to pay ordinary medical bills out of pocket, leaving insurance to pick up only large bills that exceed an annual threshold of, say, $3,000. That, according to advocates, will compel consumers to monitor physician and hospital fees carefully. But what advocates do not say is that Medisave would hurt the poor and the chronically ill and inadvertently disrupt private insurance markets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940816","headline":"WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO WIN 8 CONVERTS ON THE CRIME BILL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/us/white-house-tries-to-win-8-converts-on-the-crime-bill.html","abstract":"  The White House dangled the prospect of concessions on the crime bill before both Congressional Republicans and Democrats today, but by day's end it could not report a single new ally in its struggle to revive the troubled measure.
