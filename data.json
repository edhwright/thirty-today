Heroism counts for less in our uncommemorative age and modernist architecture of glass and steel has little use for ornament. Yet, as even a glancing look at recent outdoor sculpture reveals, the form still flourishes. Detached from old uses, it is perhaps more marginal than of yore, but it is also more adventurous: as often abstract as figurative, politically critical rather than celebratory, confrontational rather than seductive, perfectly willing to trade permanence for ephemerality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940826","headline":"1944: Battle for Paris : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/26/opinion/IHT-1944-battle-for-paris-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - American and French columns fought their way into the center of Paris today [Aug. 25] and received a thunderous welcome from her citizens as they opened battle with Germans and Vichy militiamen still entrenched in important strongholds.

In this case, the subject is Haru Reischauer, an Asian-born, Western-educated woman whose interesting bi-cultural life earned her some fame and historical import when her husband, Edwin O. Reischauer, was named American Ambassador to Japan by President John F. Kennedy.   The film begins in 1990, just after her husband's death, the day his ashes are to be ceremonially scattered over the Pacific. In her home in La Jolla, Calif., Mrs. Reischauer (played by Fumi Dan, a lovely 37-year-old Japanese actress, who, in the late-in-life sequences, is caked in truly unpersuasive makeup), is indulging in grief-stricken nostalgia. As quick as you can say Land of the Rising Sun, the film returns to prewar Japan, where Mrs. Reischauer, then known as Haru Matsukata, grew up in a privileged household with a healthy respect for Occidental culture that ran counter to Japan's prevailing nationalism. Sent to college in the United States, somewhat against her will, Haru didn't feel quite at home there, either. And indeed, the film takes as its theme the notion that Haru's life, straddling the Pacific, leaves her feeling like a fish out of water wherever she is. The feeling is naturally exacerbated by World War II and its aftermath.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940826","headline":"Market Place; One Manager's Little Gamble Prompted Big Shift in Stocks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/26/us/market-place-one-manager-s-little-gamble-prompted-big-shift-in-stocks.html","abstract":"  A strategy designed to earn the smallest of profits -- about an extra 1 percent a year -- backfired late Wednesday and played a major role in sending the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 70 points.

The days have been clear, the storms have been few and a steady southern breeze has kept the beaches pleasantly warm. Yet in many places the beaches have been worn ominously thin by an unusual summertime erosion, leaving them extremely vulnerable to the next round of winter storms. Page 1.

JOE L'S BAR COMES OUT IN INWOOD   By the time summer began, Joe Lechle, owner of Joe L's bar, was regarding most of his customers with serious contempt. Every morning he'd find crack vials and needles in the bathroom. Mr. Lechle considered closing the place but, he says, \"you don't get a pension from running a bar.\" He also felt responsible for the people who work for him. So instead of retiring he kept thinking how he might attract a better clientele, people who would have a good time, behave reasonably and spend money. In early July, he figured it out. He would make Joe L's a gay bar. About New York, Page 27.

For instance, this summer the men's shirt is back, with shirttails flapping out over the trousers -- an idea that is not very new except for the attitude of those who are wearing it. Only last year, grunge dictated that the shirt should be worn with the sleeves tied around the waist. Now, the shirt is often wrinkled, a look that suggests anti-designer, but that doesn't mean it is not a studied style. It's the uniform worn by models on their way to work at the high-fashion designer men's wear shows (far left, far right and the three men at top).

Provincetown -- the fist at the end of Cape Cod's arm, as Thoreau described it in his book \"Cape Cod\" -- is no exception. For more than 300 years renegades have taken refuge in this open-air theater of sea and Mediterranean light, from utopian Pilgrims to 17th century gamblers and smugglers; from 19th century Portuguese whalers who jumped ship to 20th-century anarchists, artists and writers; from small-business owners to a community of lesbians and gay men flying the rainbow flag.\n\nToday these overlapping legacies make Provincetown a cosmopolitan village set in natural splendor, where each person can seek a personal utopia. Old fishing shacks now front large panes of glass, catching some artist's dream of light. Cockscomb, day lilies, giant sunflowers and more flamboyant species seem to explode from every patch of ground or window ledge. Same-sex couples hold hands as they stroll, enjoying an annual week of freedom. Bicycles weave and park everywhere, defying the harried cars. The very soil is cosmopolitan, having arrived once as ballast in trading ships from such places as Plymouth, New Orleans and Spain.  Behind it all is a panorama of bay light and iridescent dunes. It is no wonder that many people consider Provincetown their home at the end of the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"ART;\nMeaning and Context Are Unimportant Except in Landscapes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/nyregion/art-meaning-and-context-are-unimportant-except-in-landscapes.html","abstract":"David Salle \n\nGuild Hall Museum, 158 Main Street, East Hampton.

The tobacco fields in Pitt County, N.C., among the country's most productive, are no longer paying farmers' bills because of a glut brought on by foreign competition.  1  WORRIES OF THEIR OWN  Despite a week of public agonies over the dismissal of the N.A.A.C.P. director, the local branches of the civil rights group are just too busy to pay much attention.  24  SOME REST FOR THE WEARY  After grappling with Cuba, the crime bill, health care and Whitewater, President Clinton and his family have started their vacation on Martha's Vineyard.  18  SCHOOL PRAYER DEBATE REIGNITED  An Atlanta teacher's refusal to observe a new state law requiring a period of \"quiet reflection\" is a reminder that the debate over school prayer is not dead.  18  THE PRESERVING OF HISTORY  The National Air and Space Museum plans to display the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, next year, but veterans groups say the display will be too forgiving of the Japanese.  25  FED OFFICIAL DISSENTS  Alan S.

In just two months, the new catechism of the Catholic Church, the first comprehensive statement of doctrine issued by the church in 400 years, has sold most of the 2.1 million copies now in print in the United States.

WHO'S BUYING: Mostly Catholics, of course, but bookstores also report surprisingly strong sales to non-Catholics and even non-Christians curious about the teachings of one of the world's most widespread and most mysterious faiths. Church leaders last codified their beliefs in a catechism published in 1566. That document had a hard time keeping up with the 20th century. \"Whether they call themselves traditionalists or progressivists, everyone welcomes the fact that, doggone it, now at least we have one place where you can go and look it up,\" said the Rev.

It was a bad situation. Q.  Has crime affected how you live? A.  It's changed me. I'm definitely more aware. I'm looking to buy a new car, and I'm thinking what models do they they steal the fastest. I have a gun permit now. I applied after the robbery.  Q.  What about the proposed private security force?  A.  In theory it sounds good, but when it comes to extra taxes, if I spend money I can hire my own. I'd have to see the details. THE RESIDENT    Sally Kuhn: Art historian, writer and an Upper East Side resident for 25 years. Lives on 77th Street. Q.  Is crime serious in your neighborhood? A.  I would say it's a moderate issue. There's certainly been an increase over the years. Q.  Have you ever been a victim? A.  A mugging, about 15 years ago. Q.  Does concern about crime affect the way you live? A.  Definitely. I take extra precautions and live very defensively. I'm careful how I travel, carrying my keys in a place different from my money and trying to look strong and alert. The type of apartment I've chosen to live in, with a 24-hour doorman, is definitely because of these issues. Q.  What about the proposed tax to pay for private security? A.  Would we become a gilded ghetto, a gated community with no gate? Initially my reaction is: No more taxes. Don't raise the expense so that everybody will leave town, and there's nobody left to guard. THE COMMANDER    Capt. George Kelly, newly installed commander of the 19th Precinct Q.  How serious is crime on the Upper East Side? A.  Crime is taking a dramatic downturn compared to last year in just about every category. It was the same thing last year and the previous year. I believe this is a relatively safe precinct but we do have our share of crime.  Q.  Do Upper East Siders have exaggerated fears? A.  It's certainly not an exaggerated concern. Safety has become the No. 1 issue throughout the country, and the East Side is no different. Q.  What's your experience with private security officers? A.  In my old precinct in Queens, the Lindenwood Village Association has had a patrol around the clock for three years, and it has contributed to a reduction in crime and the perception of crime. Q.  What about the proposed security force for the Upper East Side? A.  I would be all for anything that would reduce crime, but it's really up to the community to decide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Letters Are Acts of Faith","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/books/l-letters-are-acts-of-faith-069965.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Vivian Gornick might be pleased to know that the epistolary reflex is activated when the kids go away to camp and school.

Indeed, 70 million visitors entered the Czech Republic last year, and even though many of them were day trippers from Germany, that's more than went to France.   Tourists bring benefits for the Czechs -- over $1 billion in revenues last year, which helped balance the budget. But there are negative side effects, too.

It's a green, tidy, languorous seaside village, where day lilies and hydrangea bushes cluster beside every other front door; where the church steeples are white, the sky shines bright blue and the salt spray roses seem always in bloom. Yet with its watery salt marshes, hidden ponds and miles of wild, sandy coastline, Wellfleet is far more elemental, certainly more moody, than anything painted by Norman Rockwell. Instead, it looks like a place re-membered from childhood, one of those places that seemed larger than it really was, and both welcoming and mysterious.   Adding to Wellfleet's miragelike effect is its literal precariousness. According to some predictions, at the current erosion rate the outermost third of Cape Cod -- which includes Provincetown, Wellfleet and Truro -- could disappear in a couple of thousand years. \"The edge of the sea is a strange and beautiful place,\" wrote Rachel Carson, adding that \"always it remains an elusive and indefinable boundary.\" And perhaps nowhere is the shore more strangely beautiful, or its boundaries more elusively indefinable, than this crook of land 75 miles out to sea, with the Atlantic Ocean battering one side and Cape Cod Bay sifting away the other.

But then, the big screen has always been educational, often in ways the film makers never particularly intended. For children willing to sit still at the movies this summer, there have been lessons galore, many of them about human relations, values and the American family. Here are a few of them. The only good mom is a dead mom.   In \"Corrina, Corrina,\" a mother has died recently and suddenly (we don't know just how) and the daughter's grief is intense. One of the teen-age boys in \"Milk Money,\" which opens on Wednesday, never knew his mother at all (she died at his birth).  Both mothers favored 1950's-style fashions (floral prints and orange polka dot sundresses), which is natural enough for the mother in \"Corrina, Corrina,\" since it is the 50's but odd for the mother who died in the 80's (even if she did remind her husband of Grace Kelly). Maybe the subliminal point is that the last time there were really good mothers was 40 years ago. In \"Lassie\" and \"Angels in the Outfield,\" the mothers are also long departed. Living mothers don't fare quite as well. The mother (and to be fair, the father) in \"North\" are bad enough to make their child consider divorce. They manage to squabble with each other throughout one dinner without even acknowledging little North's presence at the table. Nannies are more loving than parents, but they don't really count.   The mother in \"Baby's Day Out\" doesn't even know what her infant's favorite picture book is; she has to get that information from the nanny. (Although the baby is preverbal, he indicates his preference with sounds and the nanny, clearly sick of this one selection, says to him, \"Couldn't we read another book?\") After the baby escapes from his kidnappers, it's the nanny who knows him well enough to figure out where he has now crawled to. Ditto for Whoopi Goldberg, playing the nanny in \"Corrina, Corrina,\" who rescues her young charge from grief-related mutism. But there is an equally relevant message: you can love your nanny just so much and no more. Molly is hooted at by her peers at school. \"What a dodo!\" one shrieks when Molly presents the family portrait she has drawn. \"She drew her maid instead of her mommy.\" Most dads are psychologically absent -- or worse.   The best father of all is Mufasa in \"The Lion King,\" but maybe that's because he is fated to die. Living fathers ignore you, a la \"North.\" The biker father in \"Angels\" gives his child up for adoption. The businessman dad in \"Baby's Day Out\" can't remember to say goodbye to his son without repeated prodding, and he doesn't hold the child once during the entire movie. The wetlands-preservation-advocate widower father in \"Milk Money\" -- an otherwise nice guy -- is willing to go to jail for his principles but doesn't seem to have considered who will take care of his son while he's there.   Meanwhile, with the exception of the earnest father, who has remarried and moved to the farm since his first wife's death, in \"Lassie,\" not a dad in sight can deal with grief. Could it be that dads are just big children? The father in \"Andre\" calls his wife \"the only real grown-up\" in the family. With only good dead mothers and flawed fathers in sight, maybe kids are learning that they have to be as independently invincible as Baby Bink and the Little Rascals. Animals are a child's best friend, and not a bad parent substitute.   The best parent in a summer movie may have been Lassie. She helps her boy mourn his dead mother, stop moping around the house and start a sheep business. Eventually she saves his life. A close second is the gorilla in \"Baby's Day Out,\" who does more than any other human (even the nanny) to protect the baby from the bad guys. Milo, the dog in \"The Mask,\" steals the key that gets Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) out of jail. Petey, the dog in \"The Little Rascals,\" is just one of the gang. Andre the seal dances, paints and plays dress-up; he does, however, watch entirely too much television. Rich is bad.   When Fred Flintstone gets a big promotion and a raise in \"The Flintstones,\" he treats his best friend, Barney Rubble (who is actually responsible for Fred's new success), badly. At a cookout, when the family's pet dinosaur grabs Barney's steak from the grill, Fred makes no effort to replace or retrieve it. He just says, \"You'll have to fight Dino for your dinner.\" Waldo in \"The Little Rascals\" is born rich, so he never had any friends in the first place. The rich people in \"Black Beauty\" make their horses wear a bearing rein, which forces them to hold their heads unnaturally high. (In the syntax of children's movies, hurting an animal is an extreme sign of depravity. Consider Willy's owners in last year's \"Free Willy\"; they wanted to do in the whale to collect his life insurance.) Girls are a mystery to boys.   Girls are so threatening or yucky or divine that boys have to band together in formal alliances like the He-Man Womun Haters Club of \"The Little Rascals\" or in informal hordes just to maintain their equilibrium. In \"Milk Money,\" three preadolescent boys raise $100 as a group to pay a prostitute to expose her breasts. At a treehouse slumber party, when they all bring objects that mystify them, the collection includes a diaphragm and an eyelash curler. The hippest of the three explains his world view: \"It's a battle of the sexes and believe me, we are way behind.\"    Children are likely to note, however, that no matter what happens before, the movies' endings are politically correct, pulled like a rabbit from a hat. Girls get into Spanky and Alfalfa's club because \"things have to change sometime.\" The prostitute in \"Milk Money\" becomes rich and independent. Fred Flintstone shakes off his contaminated wealth and renews his friendship with Barney. Black Beauty lives into retirement, Lassie gets her sheep farm, and Andre the seal returns to the wilds.    Shortly after Lassie had gone over the falls and the family presumed her dead, I overheard two young companions discussing the turn of events. \"It's obvious she's not dead,\" said the 8-year-old. The 11-year-old agreed: \"Yeah. She's the star, and the stars never die.\"   That's what they learned at the movies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"B. H.

How can this be, one hears the vexed reader protesting, aware of decades of unimaginative British retreads of Broadway classics that have had neither a heart nor a soul of any description. The answer lies in the absorption into the mainstream musical in England of a handful of directors trained primarily in the classics, not in the klieg lights of Broadway.   These are people used to textual reinvestigation, willing to subject \"Carousel\" and \"Cabaret,\" to cite just two examples, to the same scrutiny they apply to Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and Brian Friel. Do they always come up trumps? Sometimes, truth to tell, a quintessentially American genre is distorted, not enhanced. (That was the Lerner and Loewe estate's view of the British director Howard Davies's \"My Fair Lady\" last season, which owed more to the director's own 1992 production of \"Pygmalion\" at the Royal National Theater than to Moss Hart and Hanya Holm.)

These two sections surround a stunning collection of photographs of the best-known rock stars of the 60's. Mr. Landy's images refract the inspiration he felt while documenting performances by Janis Joplin at the Newport Folk Festival and by Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix at the Fillmore East. \"If the 60's generation wanted to change the world, the musicians were viewed as the leaders,\" Mr. Landy writes. \"As artists they had discovered how to tap into the essence of the time, how to utilize masses of energy to move people and communicate their feelings.\" Mr. Landy discusses at length his professional and personal relationship with Bob Dylan, particularly the sessions that resulted in the cover for the album \"Nashville Skyline,\" a photograph that he says \"perhaps . . . reflects the love we were all seeking to find through making the world a better place.\" Mike Lang, one of the organizers of the Woodstock festival, asked Mr. Landy to photograph the event; the images of the peaceful, communal life Mr. Landy witnessed there stand in an interesting, though frustratingly brief, contrast to the violence shown in the book's opening paragraphs.

The house, a National Historic Landmark administered by the Connecticut Historical Commission, was converted into a school by Ms. Crandall from 1833 to 1834 -- arguably the shortest-lived school in the state.   Its demise was the result of prejudice and threats from area residents because the pupils were young black women who, Ms. Crandall believed, were entitled to a better education than they were getting elsewhere.   A decade or so ago the building was restored and reopened as a museum, and recently Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. designated Sept. 3 a state holiday honoring Ms. Crandall and her academy.   Visitors on Saturday may take self-guided tours of the museum and its current exhibition, \"Woman's Work Is Never Done,\" and there will be a multitude of activities: Children can participate in sack races, egg-and-spoon and three-legged races, hopscotch and a checkers tournament. An adult horseshoe-pitching tournament will be held at noon, and at 1 and 3 P.M. American folk music will be performed by Ruth O'Neil on guitar and Rosie Edgar on fiddle.   Throughout the day artisans will demonstrate theorem painting, chair caning, American Indian beadwork and wood carving and other Colonial crafts. Among several food options are waffles cooked over an open fire -- a popular annual feature prepared by members of the Canterbury Historical Society.   The house is at the junction of Routes 14 and 169, and admission is $2, $1 for children and older people, free to children 5 and under. Call 546-9916 for more information. RACING AT LIME ROCK    Labor Day weekend signals the 12th annual BMW Vintage Festival of automobile racing at Lime Rock Park in Lakeville. Campers may settle in on the park's sites on Thursay, in advance of registration and inspection of cars that will take place on Friday from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Saturday from 7:30 to 1:30. Practice sessions are scheduled from 10 to 6 on Friday.   An art exhibition will be open from 10 to 4, and a swap meet will be in progress from 9 to 6 Friday through Monday, and Sunday will be devoted to a Concours d'Elegance and the Shelby American Automobile Club Show from 10 to 2. Awards will be presented from 3 to 4 P.M.   Qualifying races are scheduled on Saturday from 2 to 5:30, and major racing on Monday begins at noon and continues until 6 P.M. when awards will be presented until the park closes at 8 P.M. Featured cup races include the GMC, ITT Flygt, AGIP and Bosch, the Lime Rock Cup Can Am Race, Izod and Vintage Motorsports Cup Races, BMW and Skip Barber Racing School Cup Races.   Admission prices at the gate range from $10 on Sunday to $25 on Monday to $55 for the full event Friday through Monday. Prices are lower in advance. Call 435-0896 for reservations or more information. FOLK MUSIC BENEFIT    Take a picnic, be glad that your ticket money is going to worthy causes, and enjoy the music of Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary as well as Washboard Slim and the Blue Lights, purveyors of jugband music and blues, and the Ash Creek String Band with its mix of Southern gospel, Celtic and contemporary acoustic sounds.   The occasion is the sixth annual Founders Bank/Eli Whitney Folk Festival to be held on Saturday in Edgerton Park, an English 18th century-style park built in 1909 in New Haven and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   Each year the festival presents major folk musicians in concert, using with the proceeds going to further the work of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, a 16-year-old non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to wildlife protection, water pollution and waste disposal. The other recipient is the Farmington Canal Rail-to-Trail Association, which has been successful in converting three miles of the washed-out rail bed that replaced a 1828 canal into a jogging, biking, hiking trail in Cheshire. Three more miles in Hamden are under reconstruction and the goal is to extend the trail from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts.   The entrance to the park is at Whitney Avenue and Cliff Street near the Hamden line, and tickets are $13 in advance, $15 at the gate, or $35 for preferred seating and membership in both organizations. Call 248-6582. TWO AT THE BRUCE    Two exhibitions that are approaching their closing dates at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich are well worth a visit. They both cover aspects of a part of the world that most of us will never see in person. \"Tribal Treasures: Carpets and Jewelry from Central Asia\" will run through Sept. 11, containing a treasury of Turkmenistan culture lent by private collectors.  \"The Afghan Folio,\" a photographic exhibit may be seen through Sept. 6.   For many centuries Nomadic peoples sharing a richly diversified heritage with the Middle East, North Africa and Russia, produced an array of rugs and textiles that they used in decorating or covering their portable dwellings known as yurts. A simulation of a yurt interior is in the exhibition.   In recent decades many nomad weavers have settled down in one place and made a living from selling their richly designed and brilliantly colored carpets and cloth in bazaars and to dealers. Some 50 carpets, animal covers, wedding trappings and prayer rugs are on view.   Gold and silver jewelry inlaid with carnelian and other stones or colored glass has been a staple of Turkmen traditional costume. Restrained and simple in design it takes the forms of headdresses, collar clasps, earrings, girdles, breast ornaments, bracelets and rings as well as embellishments for knives, rifles and household implements. Forty pieces are on display.   \"The Afghan Folio,\" a set of 32 dye transfer print photographs by Luke Powell, is the result of several visits to Afghanistan during the 1970's when Mr. Powell recorded villages, mosques, ruins, people and cultural traditions on film, before much of it was destroyed in war.   The collection is considered exceptional for its artistry and its encapsulation of a fading culture. Previous showings were held at the Asia Society in New York, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, Manesh Hall in Moscow and the United Nations European Headquarters in Geneva.   The Bruce Museum is reachable from Exit 3 of Interstate 95, open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday from 2 to 5. Admission is $2.50, $2 for children 5 through 12 and older people, free on Tuesdays. Call 869-0376 for more information. FOR BIBLIOPHILES    The cavalcade of library book sales that occurs around this time each year continues in Newtown, where the Cyrenius H. Booth Library at 25 Main Street holds its 19th annual event on Saturday from noon to 5 P.M., Sunday from 11 to 4 and Monday from 9 to 4.   Some 90,000 books will be available under tents, and on Monday browsers can double their pleasure by watching the town's renowned Labor Day Parade, which marches down Main Street beginning at 10 A.M. A craft fair will also be in progress on the library lawn on Sunday and Monday and refreshments will be available all three days.    Early buyers on Saturday will receive numbered tickets at $5, on sale from 7 A.M. Admission thereafter is free. Books will be sold at half-price on Monday from 9 to 1:30, and from 2 to 4 P.M. the library will provide large bags that buyers can stuff with remaining items for $5. For more information call 426-0152. CONTEMPORARY ART    A collection of contemporary British art may be seen through Sept. 5 at the Bistro Cafe, 31 Bank Street in New Milford. Assembled by Cricket Hill Associates of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., a mother-daughter partnership specializing in presenting English and Scottish painters to an American audience, the display is diverse in style and content. Only artists of national prominence in Britain are represented, and all the works are for sale. For more information call 914-693-6062.

The graduation percentage rate, from a National Collegiate Athletic Association report released this summer, includes scholarship athletes entering school from 1984 through 1987. The figure in parenthesis is the change from the 1993 N.C.A.A. report, which covered players entering from 1983 through 1986. 1. NEBRASKA: GRADUATION RATE47 (0) 1993 TIMES RANK5 REASONS TO BELIEVE: The narrow Orange Bowl loss to Florida State reaffirmed the conviction and imagination of Tom Osborne's program and demonstrated how close Nebraska is to the top. Quarterback Tommie Frazier has emerged as a complete player, and four returning starters in the offensive line provide continuity. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: Two new starters in the secondary, a game against U.C.L.A. on Sept. 17 and a path to the Orange Bowl that goes through Norman, Okla., on Nov. 25. 2. ARIZONA: GRADUATION RATE48 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK 15 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Quarterback Dan White and returning offensive linemen, including guard Warner Smith, could be in a better position to support a dominant defense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: If the Wildcats reach their first Rose Bowl, meeting a relatively low-ranked opponent could direct the attention of pollsters elsewhere. 3. FLORIDA: GRADUATION RATE 45 (+4) 1993 TIMES RANK 2 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A new 4-3-4 defensive approach should provide assistance for a maligned defensive backfield and strengthen a unit that returns 18 of 22 players. Terry Dean's strong finish last season made him the No. 1 quarterback. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: The new status as a preseason No. 1 has played mind-games elsewhere in the past. A recent history of road disappointments will become an issue when the Gators begin an imposing late-season challenge -- a grudge game at Florida State and a possible Southeastern Conference championship game within an eight-day period. 4. MAIMI: GRADUATION RATE 53 (+2) 1993 TIMES RANK 15 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Fiesta Bowl humiliation to Arizona, one very bad day without any incentive, made Hurricanes' decline seem worse than it was. Defensive end Rusty Medearis, who may start two years after a severe knee injury, will add an emotional boost. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: There may not be enough time to allow quarterback Frank Costa to reestablish his leadership. Games against Washington and Florida State could threaten what by then should be the longest home-field winning streak in college football. 5. FLORIDA STATE: GRADUATION RATE 40 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK 1 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A continuing collection of talent should compensate for the losses from a championship unit. But a No. 1-ranking has little margin for error, and the transition at several positions might require one. Sophomore tailback Warrick Dunn could one day hold a Heisman. Quarterback Danny Kanell, once a prized recruit, will take over the offense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The fallout from the off-season scandal may be far from complete. What little dropoff between Charlie Ward as a finished product at quarterback and Kanell in the early stages could become the difference between a champion and challenger. 6. PENN STATE: GRADUATION RATE 72 (+6) 1993 TIMES RANK 6 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Seven returning offensive starters will include tailback Ki-Jana Carter and quarterback Kerry Collins. Carter averaged 6.6 yards a carry, and Collins threw two interceptions in the last three games, including the Florida Citrus Bowl victory over Tennessee. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Eight new defensive starters and an unsettling reality that is new for Penn State but old for other Big Ten members: A New Year's trip to Pasadena must be preceded by a game at Michigan. 7. ALABAMA: GRADUATION RATE 40 (+5) 1993 TIMES RANK 23 REASONS TO BELIEVE: The Tide has lost just 2 of the 26 games Jay Barker has started as quarterback. In his senior year, Barker will have the help of the offensive coordinator Homer Smith, who has returned to Alabama. Six returning defensive starters include linebacker Michael Rogers, safety Sam Shade and cornerback Tommy Johnson. Punter Bryne Diehl and place-kicker Michael Proctor give the Tide outstanding special-teams play. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Jon Stevenson is the only returning starter in the offensive line. But another soft non-conference schedule should delay any serious challenge until the Tide travels to Knoxville on the third Saturday in October. 8. NOTRE DAME: GRADUATION RATE 82 (-3) 1993 TIMES RANK 4 REASONS TO BELIEVE: This should be the season for tailback Lee Becton to become appreciated as the player he has already become. A relatively simple early schedule could leave the Irish 8-0 going into the Florida State game at Orlando. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: A defense with four returning starters, including outstanding free safety Bobby Taylor, will have just one of the top six tacklers from a year ago. The attention inspired by Ron Powlus, the gifted first-year quarterback, conceals a potentially dangerous problem: Notre Dame does not have a quarterback who has taken a snap in a game. 9. MICHIGAN: GRADUATION RATE 68 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 13 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Tyrone Wheatley's power and reliability. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Tyrone Wheatley's separated right shoulder. 10. WISCONSIN: GRADUATION RATE 71 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 11 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Tailbacks Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher combined for over 2,400 yards in 1993. Quarterback Darrell Bevell leads an offense with nine returning starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Eight days that should help determine the Big Ten race: Oct. 29 at Michigan, Nov. 5 at Ohio State. 11. COLORADO: GRADUATION RATE 55 (-5) 1993 TIMES RANK 17 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Nine returning offensive starters include the entire interior line. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The defensive secondary, a major problem last year, will be tested in non-conference games against Wisconsin, Michigan and Texas. 12. AUBURN: GRADUATION RATE 35 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 3 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A soft early schedule, with non-league games against Northeast Louisiana and East Tennessee State, should help ease the transition for offense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The surprise factor is gone following last year's undefeated season, and N.C.A.A. probation remains. 13. VIRGINIA TECH: GRADUATION RATE42 (+6) 1993 TIMES RANK18 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Maurice DeShazo, who directed an option offense last year, threw for 2,080 yards and finished fifth in the nation in passing efficiency. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Two starters in a readjusted offensive line must advance quickly. 14. OKLAHOMA: GRADUATION RATE 48 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 12 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Running back James Allen leads eight returning offensive starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Quarterback Garrick McGee, a junior-college transfer once at Arizona State, leads team that opens at Syracuse and Texas A&M. 15. TENNESSEE: GRADUATION RATE 46 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK8 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A deep offensive line, led by guard Jeff Smith, should help quarterback Jerry Colquitt in his first season as a starter. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Opener at U.C.L.A. and Sept. 17 game against Florida. 16. U.C.L.A.: GRADUATION RATE 60 (+4) 1993 TIMES RANK 19 REASONS TO BELIEVE: J. J. Stokes is considered the best receiver in the nation. Quarterback Wayne Cook provides reliability. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: With early games against Tennessee and Nebraska, the work of a rebuilt offensive line will become essential. 17. NORTH CAROLINA: GRADUATION RATE 68 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 25 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Jason Stanicek threw for 1,874 yards in 1993. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The offensive line has one returning starter -- center Pat Conneely. 18. SOUTHERN CAL: GRADUATION RATE 52 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 21 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Rob Johnson, who completed 68.6 percent of his passes last season, could introduce a quarterback to the quartet of Heisman-winning runners within Heritage Hall. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Only four returning defensive starters and opening games against Washington and Penn State. 19. TEXAS: GRADUATION RATE 44 (+9) 1993 TIMES RANK31 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Quarterback Shea Morenz will lead an offense with nine returning starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: A rushing game must develop for the Longhorns to achieve offensive balance in John Mackovic's third year as head coach. 20. TEXAS A&M: GRADUATION RATE 37 (+2) 1993 TIMES RANK 9 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Running backs Rodney Thomas and Leeland McElroy will give the Aggies a chance to extend S.W.C. record of 22 consecutive league victories. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: If streak ends, being on probation may remove late-season incentive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940828","headline":"Vancouver","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/travel/l-vancouver-042404.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: We clip your articles and use them, often when they are yellowed with age because of our travel schedule!

Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, publicly broke ranks with most of his colleagues today, saying he believed that the nation's central bank should seek to hold down unemployment in setting interest rates.   Speaking at the Federal Reserve's annual conference here, Mr. Blinder said that while controlling inflation was important, the Federal Reserve could limit unemployment for a few years at a time through low interest rates. He strongly criticized the idea, widely held among his colleagues and many economists, that a central bank would be more effective in fighting inflation if it focused solely on maintaining stable prices.   Mr. Blinder's comments revealed an intellectual split within the Federal Reserve, but seemed unlikely to produce a split over policy for the time being. Mr. Blinder said he thought unemployment in the United States, which stood at 6.1 percent in July, was now roughly as low as it could go without feeding inflation.   The clear implication of his comment, though not explicitly stated, was that the Federal Reserve could continue to raise short-term interest rates to fight any threat of inflation as long as unemployment stayed low. First Clinton Appointee    But Mr. Blinder's comments did suggest that if unemployment and inflation rose simultaneously again, as occurred in the 1970's, he would be much more reluctant than his colleagues to raise interest rates further.   Mr. Blinder is President Clinton's first appointee to the central bank, and his comments today were especially significant because he is a leading candidate to head the central bank when Mr. Greenspan's term expires early in 1996. President Reagan first appointed Mr. Greenspan in 1987, and President Bush appointed him to a second term in 1992.   In contrast to Mr. Blinder's statements today, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has tried for years in testimony before Congress to distance the central bank from responsibility for unemployment. Mr. Greenspan told a House panel on Aug. 10 that maintaining stable prices was the primary goal of the Federal Reserve.   He reminded Representatives that he had previously testified in favor of a bill that would require the Federal Reserve to pursue zero inflation above all other goals, including the reduction of unemployment.    He has said he does not believe sustained reductions in unemployment can be achieved by permitting low interest rates and rising inflation. Long-Term Approach    While Mr. Greenspan has never publicly defined the duration of a sustained reduction, none of his comments have suggested that the Federal Reserve might be able to hold down unemployment for a few years, as Mr. Blinder suggested today. Mr. Greenspan said on Aug. 10 that any unemployment gain was \"ephemeral\" and \"very quickly dissipates.\"   Mr. Blinder did say he did not believe that interest rates could be used to hold down unemployment over the long term -- which he defined as 5 to 10 years.   He said he believed the economy was now roughly at the maximum level of employment possible without feeding inflation. He had testified at his Senate confirmation hearing last spring that he supported the Federal Reserve's first three interest-rate increases.   He is widely rumored to have supported the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates by another half a percentage point on Aug. 16, although Fed officials have refused to confirm or deny this. Mr. Blinder has never publicly expressed a view on the Fed's fourth interest-rate increase, which took place in May, after his confirmation hearing but before he joined the Fed.   Mr. Greenspan made an oblique reference here on Friday to his distaste for using low interest rates and higher inflation to hold down unemployment, a tactic known in economic policy circles as using monetary policy to seek macroeconomic gain.   \"Any tendency to seek a bit of macro policy relief by pushing on the outer limits of monetary policy risks longer-term financial instability,\" Mr. Greenspan said. Endorsing a Fed Goal    Congressional Democrats amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1978 to require the central bank to seek full employment as well as price stability. It is this amendment that the bill supported by Mr. Greenspan would change.   But in an interview after his speech today, Mr. Blinder endorsed the full-employment goal. \"A central bank should have an employment objective,\" he said. \"The evidence is overwhelming.\"   Janet Yellen, who is President Clinton's other appointee to the Federal Reserve Board this year, also endorsed the use of monetary policy to hold down unemployment at her confirmation hearing in July. But she was not as emphatic as Mr. Blinder was today, nor did she actually criticize the idea that central banks can control inflation better if they do not look at unemployment.
