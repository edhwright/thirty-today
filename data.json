Yes and no. On Sunday night here at the Pensacola Civic Center, the band leaders were Led Zeppelin's main songwriters, the guitarist Jimmy Page and the singer Robert Plant, and most of their set was songs they wrote for Led Zeppelin. But they were out to rethink the music that made Led Zeppelin one of rock's most influential bands.   Led Zeppelin officially disbanded when its drummer, John Bonham, died in 1980. Since then, the surviving members have steadfastly refused the lucrative temptation to tour as Led Zeppelin, though they used the name again for one-time appearances at Live Aid in 1985 and at Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary concert in 1988. But its presence lingers. Led Zeppelin's old songs remain staples on rock radio stations, and its music has been the blueprint for numberless hard-rock bands. When this Page-Plant tour was announced, the shows quickly sold out, including the New York City area stop on April 6 at Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. An album recorded last year by the Page-Plant band, \"No Quarter\" (Atlantic), has sold a million copies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950228","headline":"U.N.

The rhetoric about reverse discrimination is the 90's equivalent of blue smoke and mirrors. Everyone in American politics knows what is going on, and if three decades of racial progress are to be abandoned, let us at least be candid about it. Republican strategists and the party's Presidential candidates have spotted a nuclear-strength wedge issue for the 1996 election.    By concocting a fantasy that white males are a new victim class in the world's richest nation, they see a highway to a pre-emptive lock on the electoral vote. The tipoff came from the 1994 Congressional election, when 62 percent of white males voted for G.O.P. candidates. By sustaining those numbers the Republicans can seal off President Clinton, or any other Democratic nominee, from victory in the nation's Southern tier, including the mega-states of Texas and California.

The scuff marks are apparent; one notes paint that was certainly brighter 26 years ago. But listeners at Friday night's revival may have actually noted something new in this worn-at-the-edges decor. In other words, time adds, not subtracts. Patina serves as metaphor. Implied seediness of scene signals a kind of knowing cynicism toward an 18th-century German culture that had a lot of trouble separating pomp from vulgarity.   I would dare to guess that other aspects of Friday's performance were brighter and fresher than they were in the 1969 original. Have the Met orchestra and its conductor James Levine, for example, ever made more elegantly sensuous music than this? Strauss's score scarcely conceals the carnal luxury and self-indulgent tenderness beneath its thin layers of decorum. The soaring trumpet figure at the end of a long evening did grate to a screech, but noting the orchestra's four and a quarter hours of heavy-duty playing, the listener was prone to forgive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950228","headline":"The Albany 2-Step: Passing Bills the Other House Hates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/28/nyregion/the-albany-2-step-passing-bills-the-other-house-hates.html","abstract":"  The New York State Senate today passed a bill reinstating the death penalty, knowing that the Assembly would not accept it.

Certain of today's star countertenors, it's true, have essayed castrato roles, particularly in Handel operas. But the core of their repertory remains music from the Renaissance to the present day written expressly for male falsetto, rather than male soprano. Michael Chance ended his splendid recital on Sunday afternoon at the Frick Collection with perhaps the finest examples of the countertenor's art, the songs of Henry Purcell.   The function of a very high male voice in Purcell is not to provide any hint of the unnatural or bizarre. At their best -- and Mr. Chance is as good as they get -- countertenors can delineate the musical line with remarkable purity and directness.  This singer has sensationally exact diction, and he connects the words with a striking range of expressive devices, occasionally letting \"real\" tenor tone well up in his voice for comic or tragic effect.

The formula they proposed would also reward states that reduced the number of abortions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950301","headline":"Mexican Family's Black Sheep Was Often Out of the Picture","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/world/mexican-family-s-black-sheep-was-often-out-of-the-picture.html","abstract":"  When his younger brother was President of Mexico, Raul Salinas de Gortari was seldom seen, but his presence was often felt in questionable private business deals.

The immediate plan has the M.T.A.'s go-ahead for everything but the proposed cuts in service, which must go through public hearings. The Transit Authority sensibly seeks the biggest savings from trimming bureaucracy and increasing productivity.

Yet what wonderful music she makes within those limitations. Four Brahms lieder -- \"Dein blaues Auge,\" \"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer,\" \"Auf dem Kirchhofe\" and \"Verzagen\" -- had the proper tone of sad repose, broken at times by piercing anguish. Three famous Tchaikovsky songs -- \"Again, as Before, Alone,\" \"None but the Lonely Heart\" and \"Was I Not a Little Blade of Grass\" -- profited from the singer's plush legato.

The vote is scheduled for 2 P.M., and the Republican majority leader, Bob Dole, pledged that if it failed, he would revive the issue at the height of the 1996 election campaign. He attacked several Democratic opponents for what he called a \"stunning flipflop\" on a measure they voted for a year ago, and other Republican senators criticized President Clinton's opposition, as well. On Tuesday, Mr. Dole suddenly postponed the vote on the amendment when it became clear that he had just 66 of the 67 votes needed. The decision to have the final vote today came after apparently unsuccessful attempts to reach a compromise that would keep Social Security trust funds off limits to budget cutters. \"There is no reason a balanced budget amendment could not pass with nearly 80 votes in a matter of a few minutes -- if they're willing to protect Social Security,\" said Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 79 percent of Americans said they favored a constitutional amendment that would require the Federal Government to balance the budget 2002, but only 32 percent said they were in favor if it would require cuts in Social Security.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950302","headline":"On the Angry Airwaves, the Response to the Budget Vote Is Underwhelming","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/us/104th-congress-talk-radio-angry-airwaves-response-budget-vote-underwhelming.html","abstract":"  Having come up one short of the 67 votes he needed to pass a balanced-budget amendment, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, turned yesterday to Rush Limbaugh, the talk radio figure who has served as an electronic precinct captain for Republicans in Congress.
