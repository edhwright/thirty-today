The 18-year-old Capriati, unranked and unseeded because of her absence from the Tour since a first-round loss at the 1993 United States Open, announced last week that she had received wild cards into the main draws of the European Indoors at Zurich and the Porsche Grand Prix at Filderstadt, Germany.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940927","headline":"Back to the Present in a Long-Lost Novel by Verne","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/books/back-to-the-present-in-a-long-lost-novel-by-verne.html","abstract":"  Jules Verne's publisher said it pained him to write so blunt a letter but, after the success of the young storyteller's first book, \"Five Weeks in a Balloon,\" he felt obliged to warn that publication of his new manuscript would be \"a disaster\" for his name.   \"I did not expect something perfect,\" the disappointed publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, wrote the author in late 1863, \"but I expected better.\" And as if testing fate, Hetzel added, \"My dear Verne, if you were a prophet, no one would believe your prophecies today.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940927","headline":"Providing a Haven for the Neglected and Rejected","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/arts/music-review-providing-a-haven-for-the-neglected-and-rejected.html","abstract":"  We tend to think of musical history as a serene, all-knowing judge, separating, over the generations, the gold from the dross. History leaves us with Beethoven and filters away Czerny; it elevates Wagner and relegates most of Meyerbeer to a specialty taste. And its verdicts, at least during the last 50 years, have tended to seem quite wise. Is there anybody clamoring for a staged revival of Michael William Balfe's once wildly popular opera, \"The Bohemian Girl\"?   But Leon Botstein, as music director of the American Symphony Orchestra since 1991, has opened a court of appeals. His brand of \"thematic programming\" is often concerned with the fallibility of history's judgment. Mr. Botstein reaches over history's head to the audience, and asks it to reconsider the neglected and rejected. Mr. Botstein urges his listeners to hear the case from the beginning, without being prejudiced by the defendant's previous record.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940927","headline":"Mexican Election Loses Some Luster as Fraud Is Uncovered","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/world/mexican-election-loses-some-luster-as-fraud-is-uncovered.html","abstract":"  The record Mexico compiled in conducting what many observers said were the first free and clean elections in decades is being tarnished by irregularities in several areas and accusations that political parties are bargaining over election results.

Eventually it became crumpled and was all but destroyed after he had his mother iron it for him. At 12, he developed a new fixation. He became erotically obsessed with the television character Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.     Although Mr. Crumb went on to create such famous modern cartoon characters as Fritz the Cat and Mr. Natural, and helped to found the underground-comic movement, Bugs Bunny and Sheena continued to reverberate through his art.

That is probably true. Congress has thereby blocked President Clinton's main legislative initiative and consigned 40 million uninsured Americans to another year of medical roulette.   The defeat ought to trigger an orgy of blame, and there is no shortage of deserving recipients. White House insistence on secret deliberations produced a bill that no one on Capitol Hill was committed to support. A politically inept health adviser, Ira Magaziner, designed a legislative behemoth that scared most members of Congress -- and the public. Hillary Rodham Clinton alienated the pharmaceutical industry and other interest groups that she ultimately needed to push reform through Congress. Demagogic special-interest lobbying and cynical Republican obstructionism designed by Bob Dole in the Senate and Newt Gingrich in the House played a role in the final stall.

Now, in a series of new studies, researchers are finding that insects take their specializations to surprising extremes, becoming highly adapted to eating not just plants of a particular species but specific plants. So fine-tuned are these pests that they can fail to thrive even on plants of the same species growing as little as a few feet away from the one they are adapted to.    The discovery of this evolution of eating preferences has helped explain the long-puzzling observation that some plants can be devastated by voracious insect pests while others of the same species, some close enough to have their branches entwined in their beleaguered neighbors', remain virtually untouched. Researchers say the studies also provide new insights into the evolutionary race between insect pests and the plants they attack, revealing both how quickly insects adapt to their hosts and how variable plants' defenses can be. At the same time, the new work has signaled the importance of maintaining heterogeneity in crops as a means of preventing pest outbreaks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940927","headline":"How a Tense Standoff in Haiti Erupted Into Deadly Shootout With the Marines","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/world/mission-haiti-post-mortem-tense-standoff-haiti-erupted-into-deadly-shootout-with.html","abstract":"  On one side of the narrow street, two dozen members of the Haitian security forces played cards on the sidewalk or tended to business inside the blocklong central police headquarters.

Speaking in New York at the fifth and final hearing of a Congressional commission studying discrimination at the executive level, Mr. Reich said artificial barriers to advancement are holding back many women and minorities from attaining positions commensurate with their skills, training and numbers, and preventing the economy from growing to its full potential.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940927","headline":"Right to Life Nominee Looks Beyond Albany; Diverting Votes as a National Message","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/nyregion/right-to-life-nominee-looks-beyond-albany-diverting-votes-as-a-national-message.html","abstract":"  For all the ballot-proven fervor of the Right to Life Party in state elections, its dedication this gubernatorial year is extra heated and targeted to teach a larger national lesson to Republicans intent on retreating strategically from the politics of the abortion issue.

This must mean, so Botvinnik inferred, that his second was divulging his secret analysis to the enemy. Accordingly, Botvinnik labored without the help of a second in subsequent matches with Smyslov.   Betrayal is not unknown on the highest levels of chess, but there can be other explanations. In the case of Botvinnik and Smyslov, the brilliant Smyslov was quite capable of predicting the course chess theory would take and the spin Botvinnik might give it. And even if he was surprised, Smyslov was extraordinarily adept at thinking up solutions over the board.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940927","time":"1994-09-27

Made by masterly film makers -- Alexander Sokurov from Russia and Mani Kaul from India -- they are like elegant visual riffs on literary themes.    \"Whispering Pages\" is Mr. Sokurov's haunting black-and-white meditation on themes from 19th-century Russian literature, most conspicuously \"Crime and Punishment.\" There is a murderer, the Raskolnikov character, who lives in a hovel and wanders the banks of a river. There is a woman, the holy prostitute figure. She becomes the focus of he murderer's philosophical questions about life, guilt and God, phrased in the film's sparse dialogue. Mostly there is extraordinary photography, a palette of dusty gray tones that echo the faded look of 19th-century photographs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940928","headline":"U.S. Plans Vast Restoration for Everglades","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/us/us-plans-vast-restoration-for-everglades.html","abstract":"  The Federal Government has drawn up an ambitious plan to restore the Everglades of southern Florida, reshaping much of the region's 11,000 square miles into something closer to the undisturbed wetlands of a century ago.

This is a craven and destructive bow to the demands of textile firms in his home state of South Carolina, who fear competition from abroad under the accord. If Mr. Hollings is successful, as he well might be, he would thereby delay and possibly block for good approval of a bill that would add $200 billion a year to the U.S. economy.   Mr. Hollings is the main culprit, but the White House was his enabler. It dallied in getting the legislation to Congress. Then it rejected advice to sidestep Mr. Hollings's committee.

Or at least that is how it looked on maps, from the air and in the mind's eye of many a Parisian.   By the 1980's, however, the view from the ground had become one of disorder, not only in the form of fast-food restaurants, garish lights, strewn garbage and chaotically parked cars, but also in the shape of Hell's Angels, panhandlers and streetwalkers, who do not make for, well, visual neatness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940929","headline":"Expansion Pool Approved","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/sports/expansion-pool-approved.html","abstract":"  At a meeting in Dallas yesterday, National Football League owners accepted a recommendation from the league's Management Council to have the two new expansion teams -- Carolina and Jacksonville -- stocked with a pool of players that will draw six or seven veterans from the other 28 teams and two selections per round in the 1995 college draft. The two teams will select from a pool of 42 players and must keep 30, or an amount worth $14 million, until July 15. The $14 million amount was included to prevent the expansion teams from going after several high priced free agents.   There will be no kickers or punters in the pool; each of the 28 teams are allowed to offer only one veteran with 10 or more years of experience and only one player from injured reserve. And each veteran from the existing teams must have an additional year on his contract before being placed in the pool.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940929","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/nyregion/c-corrections-384470.html","abstract":"  An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the acquisition of two financial companies by two large banks misstated the price of one purchase.
