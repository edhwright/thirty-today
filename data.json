She won Emmy Awards for her performances in \"See How She Runs\" (1978) and \"Do You Remember Love?\" (1985). The first was about marathon running, the second Alzheimer's disease. Earlier this year, in Alison Lurie's \"Foreign Affairs,\" she shone as a middle-aged academic finding love where she least expected. And now, this Sunday at 9 P.M. in \"Blind Spot,\" she is a powerfully confident Congresswoman who has to confront drug addiction in her own family.    For Ms. Woodward, the subject of drugs takes on obvious personal dimensions. In 1978, Scott Newman, Mr. Newman's 28-year-old son from a first marriage, died of an overdose of Valium and alcohol. In the years since, Ms. Woodward and her family have worked closely with the Scott Newman Center, which is dedicated to drug education. In \"Blind Spot,\" co-produced by Ms. Woodward as a \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" presentation, the actress extends the reach of that education.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930430","headline":"Representation Is Issue In Brooklyn's District 14","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/30/nyregion/representation-is-issue-in-brooklyn-s-district-14.html","abstract":"  Claribel Lozada was elected to her Brooklyn school board in 1989 by a group of parents determined to increase Hispanic and black power on a board where neither group had known a strong voice.

The general sense that shows are jockeying for position is confirmed by some recent shifts in marketing strategies.   To begin with, two new musicals are staggering after a critical pounding. The brassy, ubiquitous ads for \"Ain't Broadway Grand\" apparently did not lift attendance much, and the producers have now adopted a strategy of silence. After opening night, contrary to general practice, they would not supply weekly Variety with box-office totals for the first week, leaving the magazine to estimate receipts at a paltry $137,000. The show's press representative, Fred Nathan, said sales were slightly better this week than last, although he would not give figures. On Wednesday, the show ran a newspaper ad with a probably unique offer: any patrons who, by intermission, didn't like the show enough to stay until the end, could have their money back.

Charles Oakley was ejected. But thanks to Patrick Ewing, who made a game-deciding 12-foot fadeaway jumper with 10.8 seconds to play, the Knicks managed to escape Madison Square Garden with a 107-104 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of their three-of-five-game playoff series last night. Reggie Miller missed a 26-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer that could have sent the game into overtime.   Squandering a 19-point third-quarter lead, the Knicks found themselves nervously finishing a game that many people expected them to waltz through. New York won 60 games this season, while the Pacers (41-41) barely made the playoffs as the eighth-seeded team in the East.

Hogue injured the knuckle twice in the first-round series against the Washington Capitals, which the Islanders won, four games to two. The first injury came in Game 3 when Washington's Kevin Hatcher slashed him. Ed Tyburski, the Islanders' trainer, said there was no fracture but said the knuckle has an arthritic condition.

But the initial lines of partisan division were apparent.  8  SKEPTICISM OVER JOB STATUS    Federal judges expressed profound skepticism about Mrs. Clinton's assertion that she is a Federal \"officer or employee\" entitled to exclude the public from meetings of her health policy panel.  8  RETROACTIVE RIGHTS LAW?

The action is streamlined, the music is played faster than usual and the spacious sets suggest that production values alone could carry the day.    Yet this \"Beauty\" also serves as a school or training ground for classical dancing. Principals and soloists mature in roles that are more difficult than they seem and debuts are ceaseless. Nikolaj Hubbe will dance for the first time as the Prince tonight at the New York State Theater; he tried his hand at the production's mixture of choreography by Marius Petipa and Mr. Martins in last Sunday's matinee performance of the \"Jewels\" divertissement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930501","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/01/sports/transactions-238993.html","abstract":"  Football National Football League  CINCINNATI BENGALS -- Signed Jay Schroeder, quarterback.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930501","headline":"Review/Film; Mazursky's Sweet-and-Sour View of Hollywood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/01/movies/review-film-mazursky-s-sweet-and-sour-view-of-hollywood.html","abstract":"Another Hollywood putdown, in New York, via Paul Mazursky.

A decade earlier, the four Firesigns -- Philip Austin, Peter Bergman, David Ossman and Philip Proctor -- had ruled the world of underground radio and smoky all-night listening sessions around college dorm-room turntables. Their densely textured, politically charged, pun-filled and omnivorously allusive \"ear-plays\" broke from conventional stand-up schtick the way \"Sergeant Pepper's\" transcended Top 40. The four Firesigns (all fire signs, though the name also had nice subversive overtones) became comic seers to the generation that started attending college, smoking dope and questioning authority when Richard M. Nixon was President.   By the early 1980's, that generation had mutated into yuppiedom and the Firesign Theater seemed as dated as the media of its success: underground radio and vinyl records. A different comedy was booming, blunt and visceral, filled with cocaine jokes instead of surreal stoned narratives. The new crowds lacked the inclination, or maybe the attention span, to follow Firesign's long, loopy, literate audio labyrinths.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"The View From: Armonk;\nSnuffing Out the Last Vestige of Smoking at Byram Hills High","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/the-view-from-armonk-snuffing-out-the-last-vestige-of-smoking-at.html","abstract":"IT'S the 1990's, and nicotine may be the most controversial drug around.

Three defiant members of the organization were injured in the attack, which sent bystanders fleeing. The incident drew more attention to the Latin Kings, an organization of Hispanic and Italian men and women founded four years ago within the state's prison system. Over the last two years authorities have linked the band to scores of assaults and at least six homicides. As reports of the group's activities surfaced in the news media, Beatrice Codianni of New Haven, a longtime supporter of grass roots politics, took note. What she read and heard, she said, mirrored the days when she worked with the Black Panthers in the late 1960's and witnessed the Federal Bureau of Investigation discredit the organization by circulating distorted information to the public.   The same pattern was occurring with the Latin Kings, which was a relatively young organization in Connecticut having what Ms. Codianni called positive goals. Though she recognized that the group had a violent element, she said she had also seen how it had changed the lives of people like her 21-year-old son Andrew, by steering him away from drugs and giving him a strict moral code to live by. In May of last year Ms. Codianni began corresponding with Pedro Millan, one of the founders of the Latin Kings who is currently awaiting trial in a state prison on conspiracy charges stemming from the Meriden shootout. She suggested to him that the Latin Kings begin a public campaign to change their image, and that they begin by offering AIDS education along with literacy and high school classes to its members. Ms. Codianni soon after joined the organization and now serves on the board of directors, making her one of the Latin Kings highest ranking members.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"In Brooklyn's District 15, Divisions of the City Are Reflected in the Campaign","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/in-brooklyn-s-district-15-divisions-of-the-city-are-reflected-in-the-campaign.html","abstract":"  Six months ago, the board of School District 15 in Brooklyn so angered some parents by approving a modified version of the Rainbow Curriculum that the police had to escort board members out when their meeting ended.

The strategy, clearly visible at a U.A.W. conference last week, is critical for survival, the union leadership says. But some union officials and members say the new approach, and a willingness to bend traditional union goals in other areas, could end up destroying the union rather than saving it. Adapt, Rather Than Confront    The debate between union leaders who consider themselves flexible and willing to adapt to the auto makers' needs and those who prefer a more traditional militancy makes the U.A.W. a testing ground for organized labor.

Foreigners living in or visiting Japan from the 1870's onward were the first to appreciate and collect these paintings; more than 200 of them now held by the British Museum are reproduced, in color, in UKIYO-E PAINTINGS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM (Smithsonian Institution, $39.95). Courtesans of the Yoshiwara pleasure district of Tokyo are the predominant subjects. In his introduction, Timothy Clark, a curator at the museum, describes the government-licensed brothel quarter, which opened in 1617, and something of the lives of the women indentured there. He notes that the idealized images of    ukiyo-e    -- meant to extol the amusements of the quarter and the charms of its highest-ranking prostitutes -- did not show \"the seamier side of the prostitution industry that is known all too well to have existed from diaries, popular literature and other written sources.\" Indeed, plate after plate depicts elegant women lounging about waiting for their patrons, reading love letters or strolling to houses of assignation. The elaborate designs of their kimonos and sashes are far more expressive than their stylized facial features. Also in this collection are paintings of craftsmen at work, landscapes, a selection of forgeries and some erotica. Students of art history will appreciate Mr. Clark's detailed notes on the artists. And we can thank him as well for his candor in declaring that the primly titled \"Maids Seduced by Workmen\" is, in fact, a painting of a rape.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"The State's Drug Companies Face New Political Environment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/the-state-s-drug-companies-face-new-political-environment.html","abstract":"  WHILE the rest of the Connecticut economy languishes, pharmaceutical research is growing across the state.

On the merits, the vote should go to Carl McCall, president of New York City's Board of Education. He has performed sensibly and responsibly in that difficult role, and that performance argues for the challenge of higher office.   Gov. Mario Cuomo's backing for Mr. McCall raises the issue of independence. A Democratic comptroller must be just as independent from Democratic governors and legislators as Mr. Regan was in auditing state accounts and investing pension funds.

About five million years ago, Mr. McKenna said, our remote ancestors left the African rain forest for what were the verdant Saharan grasslands. In search of protein-rich grubs and beetles, they flipped over dried cow pies and discovered the dung-loving psilocybin mushroom.    \"For sure the mushroom would have been sampled,\" Mr. McKenna said. \"Then our proto-hominid forebears, like legions of hippies millennia hence, discovered that the usual activities comprising the whirl of their days -- hunting and gathering, primarily -- were out of the question.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"The Pair That Fell to
