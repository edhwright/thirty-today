But this and another recent Muller piece on the program, \"Glass Houses,\" seem to be dances for people who care less about dance than about sleek good looks and social bromides. Ms. Muller talked of the mystery of dance in an opening-night speech. But there was no mystery here.    \"Thesaurus,\" danced to initially bracing music by Buddy Rich and His Orchestra, is likely to become a Muller classic. It is a bright, fast-paced romp for 11 performers who wear yellow trunks and halters and dance with a variety of cleverly conceived yellow props. The piece is based on the 500 words Ms. Muller found listed under \"to move\" in Roget's Thesaurus. The choreography is ingenious, weaving together steps and gestures that clearly communicate even surprising meanings like \"dab\" and \"whisper\" -- though \"go pitapat\" and \"hang on the skirts of\" slipped by unnoticed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-296193.html","abstract":"  Tshala Muana The Ritz    Late on Friday night, at the Ritz, Tshala Muana introduced a ballad by praising God and urging listeners to pray every day.

Six months after the efforts began, the experts say that the city's four demonstration programs -- including a storefront to dispense hypodermic needles on the Lower East Side and outreach work on the streets in Harlem and the Bronx -- have succeeded in enrolling 5,000 addicts, far more than in previous needle exchange programs in the city, both legal and illegal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: The President's Day; Clinton Is a Revisionist Even With His Writers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/us/clinton-s-economic-plan-president-s-day-clinton-revisionist-even-with-his.html","abstract":"  Dozens of aides spent hundreds of hours of endless toil drafting the speech that President Clinton took to Capitol Hill with him tonight.

At the same time, the Council began to discuss plans for setting up a new international tribunal to judge those accused of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"Two Players Lose","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/sports/sports-people-baseball-two-players-lose.html","abstract":"  JAY BERGEN, a New York lawyer representing three clubs in salary arbitration cases, won one and argued one yesterday. Bergen, who has been the busiest club representative this arbitration season, appeared before ROBERT CREO in Chicago and presented the Yankees' case for paying infielder RANDY VELARDE $600,000 instead of $1.05 million. Velarde batted .272 while earning $360,000 last year.   Pending Creo's decision, Bergen has a 3-1 record. NICHOLAS ZUMAS, another arbitrator, ruled yesterday in favor of Bergen and his client, the San Francisco Giants, over JEFF BRANTLEY. The relief pitcher, who was 7-7 with a 2.95 earned run average last season, had a $1,125,000 salary for 1992. He will now earn $1.5 million instead of the $2.6 million he sought.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-92199080039.html","abstract":"As an American working with German officials in Eastern Germany, I have observed an investment environment characterized by rapid infrastructure modernization, and by motivated and cooperative workers.

The move meant an immediate halt to most of the missions being undertaken in what has become one of the most complex and dangerous relief operations in the history of the United Nations. It appeared to carry potentially grave consequences for some of the 1.6 million people here who are estimated by United Nations relief officials to be at risk from hunger, disease and exposure to the bitter Balkan winter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"Musicians Ratify Contract But One Group Still Balks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/arts/musicians-ratify-contract-but-one-group-still-balks.html","abstract":"  The freelance musicians who struck nine orchestras last month have ratified a contract negotiated by Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians and the Orchestra Managers of New York. But one ensemble, the American Composers Orchestra, has not agreed on side issues that are being negotiated separately. Joseph Bongiorno, the chairman of the players' committee, said on Tuesday night that the musicians had rejected management's latest offer.   Mr. Bongiorno said the composers' orchestra was still on strike, and both he and the orchestra's executive director, Jesse Rosen, raised questions about whether its next concert would take place as scheduled on March 21. The orchestra's last concert and a planned recording session were casualties of the strike. Mr. Rosen has told the players by letter that unless they guarantee him \"on or around Feb. 22\" that they will perform, he will cancel the concert.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"Vincent Jones, 86, A Former Executive For Gannett Papers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/nyregion/vincent-jones-86-a-former-executive-for-gannett-papers.html","abstract":"  Vincent S.

The slickly produced revue, in which six vocalists and a rock sextet perform more than 30 songs for which Ms. King wrote the music, aspires to be little more than a choreographed concert. If it lacks the theatrical energy, imagination and wit of anthologies like \"Ain't Misbehavin' \" and \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" it offers a richly nostalgic overview of a songwriter whose work seems more traditional today than it did 20 years ago.    Ms. King had the distinction of becoming a pop star a decade after she had established herself as a successful composer of teen-age pop songs with her husband, the lyricist Gerry Goffin. Overnight, it seemed, her phenomenally successful 1971 album, \"Tapestry,\" made the frizzy-haired songwriter with a Brooklyn twang an urban earth mother for the rock generation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Part of Woman's H.I.V.

Still, an exhibition of Beuys's drawings, even one that encompasses installations and multimedia pieces as this one does, can go only so far. Seven years after Beuys's death at 64, his art remains a maze of conundrums and enigmas. And what show could do more than hint at the charismatic persona that became the essence of Beuys's work through the performances and political activities that made him world famous?   One of the canonical images of 20th-century art is surely the death-masklike image of Beuys himself: gaunt, hollow-eyed and hollow-cheeked, invariably dressed in vest and battered hat. Shaman or charlatan? For more than one generation of politically minded artists, and especially for his fellow German artists, Beuys has been regarded with a reverence matched in its ferocity only by the ridicule that has also been heaped upon him. It was part of his openness of spirit that he reacted to mockery with disarming courtesy. Among the many aspects difficult to reconcile about Beuys was that he was both a kind of megalomaniac and also virtually indifferent to art-world success in the traditional sense.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Republicans Honor Weinberger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/us/republicans-honor-weinberger.html","abstract":"  At a gathering of conservatives attended by three of the men pardoned by President George Bush for their roles in the Iran-Contra affair, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas tonight paid an emotional tribute to Caspar W.

For example, her use of schlock figures from popular culture (in her case the pathetic cartoon characters on greeting cards) preceded Jeff Koons's translation of such figures into sculpture, as demonstrated by \"Hystorical,\" a 1983 painting that hangs in the gallery's office. So it is especially painful to see Ms. Wachtel's latest efforts, which present derivative dilutions of strategies she helped formulate.    These seemingly transitional paintings suggest an amalgam of work made in the 1980's by Richard Prince, Peter Halley and the team of Wallace and Donahue. They combine hard-edge abstraction and daytime television, juxtaposing silkscreened images of faces on the afternoon talk shows with monochrome panels that are variously notched and shaped. The colors and images appear to be subtly matched, both in hue and in emotional vapidness. In \"Massapequa,\" the face of a woman with bright orange lipstick and a greenish tint is embedded in panels of bright orange and green; in \"I'm O.K., You're O.K.\" a stolid male face is framed in panels of anonymous brown and yellow. It turns out that the colors are taken from corporate logos, mall interiors and fast food restaurant uniforms.    To some extent, Ms. Wachtel's subject has always been the falseness of American life, and there is certainly no small relationship between television's canned emotions and the mindless palette of corporate America. But for the moment that relationship remains largely conceptual, more in the artist's head than on canvas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Museum Set to Lose Indian Treasure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/us/museum-set-to-lose-indian-treasure.html","abstract":"  For years, Audrey Stevens, the curator of a small one-room museum in the town library here, treasured the museum's collection of Indian artistry: an array of beaded shirts and purses, suede leggings, wooden pipes and braided locks of human hair.

So what is Mr. Clinton's vision? At its simplest, that it doesn't matter whether you tax and spend by Democratic or Republican rules, as long as you are willing to make politically difficult choices.

In its encyclopedic survey of religious feelings, Bach's work had imitated in its musical lines the lashes of a whip, the weeping of the faithful, the fury of a crowd, the mockery of nonbelievers; the music had followed the text of the passion, interpolated with the exquisite commentary of arias and chorales. In the concluding moments, all the contrasts and trials of the story seemed a dream, leaving behind a gentle faith.   This was obviously not, for Mr. Masur, a casual performance. There is, of course, the geographic connection he has with the music: Bach's passion was composed and first heard in Leipzig, where Mr. Masur has been music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra since 1970. But Mr. Masur, in leading 24 members of the New York Philharmonic along with the Westminster Symphonic Choir in this work, also showed a close connection with its dramatic and religious meaning. The strict orthodoxies of authenticity were put aside, without doing harm to the score itself. There were times when matters became mundane, when there was too much stress, or too much exaggeration, but those were minor flaws in a performance that spoke of a deep love for this music and its powers.

This is progress in the fragile world of the New York Mets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930220","headline":"Freed Man To Return To Custody","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/nyregion/freed-man-to-return-to-custody.html","abstract":"  A mentally ill man released by a judge from a psychiatric center two weeks ago despite a history of substance abuse and arrests was ordered back into custody yesterday by an appellate court pending a full hearing on whether he is dangerous to himself or others.   In an unusual ruling that reversed one of its own judges, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan directed that Francis Stuart, 38 years old, be recommitted to the state's South Beach Psychiatric Center on Staten Island while evidence of his condition and the probable impact of his release are examined by the court.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930220","headline":"How to Beef Up New York Police Foot Patrols","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/opinion/l-how-to-beef-up-new-york-police-foot-patrols-046993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your Jan. 28 news article on the failure of New York City's Dinkins administration to civilianize administrative posts held by police officers is right on the mark. Citizens would receive more bang for the buck if the administration honored its pledge to hire civilians, who cost about half as much as police officers, and redeploy officers performing desk jobs to foot patrol. However, there are additional ways to augment foot patrol.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930220","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/arts/classical-music-in-review-024893.html","abstract":"  Vienna Philharmonic Carnegie Hall","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930220","headline":"Review/Rock; Hyperactive Band of One For Techno","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/arts/review-rock-hyperactive-band-of-one-for-techno.html","abstract":"  If techno music is going to make the leap from dance clubs to the pop charts, its starkly propulsive dance rhythms are going to need melodies, identifiable stars or both. Moby, a one-man band from New York City, could be the techno performer whose showmanship carries him to a wider audience without turning techno tracks into pop songs.    He performed last Saturday night at a rave concert at the Academy that had the requisite eye-popping lights, recorded dance music and an audience dressed in bright, loose clothes. Moby's techno has bits of rap in it, but it depends on dissonant electronic syncopations and booming drumbeats and basslines.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930220","headline":"At Auction, Words and Works on Wine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/style/IHT-at-auction-words-and-works-on-wine.html","abstract":"-The finest collection of works on wine ever to reach the auction market will be sold in Paris on Saturday- 650 items ranging from the earliest printed book on the subject to sought-after Art Deco posters commissioned by the Nicolas wine dealers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930220","headline":"Indiana Player Injured","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/sports/sports-people-college-basketball-indiana-player-injured.html","abstract":"  Top-ranked Indiana, which has been limited to nine players for most of the season, suffered another blow when forward ALAN HENDERSON injured his right knee during practice yesterday in Bloomington, Ind.
