And it's not always convincing, as this simply and handsomely installed show of nearly 60 paintings and sculptures from 1962 to the present (on view through Sept. 19) cannot fail to demonstrate. Yet his up-and-down quality is, in one respect, to Mr. Morley's credit: he is a taker of risks, venturesome not just in the sense that he loves to paint fantastical landscapes and imaginary midair battles that border on the incomprehensible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Sports of The Times; Newest Jet Can Cite Montana and Rice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/sports/sports-of-the-times-newest-jet-can-cite-montana-and-rice.html","abstract":"  THIS is not just another football camp.

The day falls on a Sunday in a cyclical pattern of 11, 6, 5 and 6 years -- the last time in 1982, the next time in 1999. While July 25 is a special day, the celebrations go on all year, drawing hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to embrace the statue of St. James that stands over the altar in the cathedral or to pray before the ornate silver urn that is thought to contain his bones.   The difference this year, though, is that the remote and long-backward region of Galicia, which has Santiago as its capital, has decided to use Xacobeo '93 -- St. James's Day in the language of Galicia -- to promote itself and the pilgrims' trail as a tourist destination. The Church is not too happy with the competition.

Cooing and flattering a man are the ways to keep him, the spirit advises. But that advice doesn't pay off. While telling the story, the daughter realizes to her dismay that she has absorbed too many of her mother's feelings that women should be men's angelic supporters and nurturers.    \"I thought I was by myself, but I cannot kill the angel in the house,\" she reflects with some bitterness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Compact, Versatile And Waterproof","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/style/camera-compact-versatile-and-waterproof.html","abstract":"  THOUGH Pentax did not specifically design its Zoom 90 Weather Resistant 35-millimeter camera to be bomb resistant, it turns out that it is.

The Government sets basic fees for doctors' visits, specialist consultations, surgical procedures. You go to the doctor of your choice. The Government's fee list isn't binding; fancy doctors can charge more, but the patient then has to pick up the difference.   If your doctor bills the Government directly (about 70 percent do), his assistant slips the card through a device just like the ones used for charge cards, and no money changes hands. Otherwise, a typical visit to a family doctor costs about $30, of which Medicare pays about $19. You can go to the doctor, pay and then take the receipt down to your local Medicare office (there's one in every neighborhood and shopping center), present your card and get cash back on the spot. Or you can be billed by the doctor, send the bill to Medicare and receive a check made out to the doctor.   Private insurance companies supplement the public system. Although excellent free treatment is universally available in public hospitals, those who want to choose their own surgeon and stay in private, comfortable-to-luxurious hospitals can go to the private insurers for coverage beyond Medicare. Such a policy for a family costs $1,000 to $2,000 a year.   The system (which also subsidizes most prescriptions) is financed by a flat 1.4 percent levy on income. Most Australians consider it well worth the price. Employers have no role in the system and are thus free to provide other benefits, like a standard six weeks of vacation.   Some savings are built into the system. When a baby is born, for instance, the hospital notifies an infant health center in the family's neighborhood. Within days, the parents are visited by a highly trained nurse. Typically these \"sisters\" try to get to know the mother, offer a phone number where they can be reached for advice on everything from bathing to breast-feeding, and make an appointment for the baby at the health center. These nurses take care of all the baby's routine health needs. Specialist pediatricians only see very sick children.   The most common complaint in Australia about health care is that people must often wait if they want the Government to pay for elective surgery. But it does pay for a huge range of procedures, from plastic surgery to psychotherapy, as long as there's a referral from a general practitioner.   Within a year each state will have a health care ombudsman to handle complaints from the public about doctors or hospitals. Several states have had them for some years. Malpractice suits are rare and the number is not increasing, since more and more are settled by negotiation through the ombudsmen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Let's Stop Buying a Secret Foreign Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/opinion/l-let-s-stop-buying-a-secret-foreign-policy-230593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   We were disappointed by \"Can It Be Happening?\" by A.

Like the older, larger and slightly more formal Stamford establishment (which has a more elaborate menu), Via Sforza has artfully designed its smallish storefront interior to resemble an outdoor scene in Italy, with stuccoed walls with faux windows and doors (and even an advertising poster on one wall). A trellised alcove suggests a cozy grape arbor. In one corner of the dining room, chefs work at an open-to-view brick pizza oven.    Aptly dubbed a trattoria, Via Sforza is casual and informal, drawing heavily on pastas and pizzas, with a short list of seafood, chicken and meat dishes. On the whole, the thin-crusted pizzas are the best bet. While a large one seems pricey at $14, $15 or $16 (depending on the toppings), it can serve at least three ravenous diners. A smaller one (averaging $8) is about right for one, with a salad or starter. Most interesting of the pizzas was quattro stagione: four separate toppings of prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and, best of all, capers (inspired!). Napoli, with fresh garlic, scallions and fresh clams, was a pungent treat, while the lighter Margherita, with cheese, basil, tomatoes and olive oil, made a refreshing summer choice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"The Sound Gets Cleaner","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/nyregion/the-sound-gets-cleaner.html","abstract":"  FROM Kristine Fontana's lifeguard chair on the beach at Branford Point, Long Island Sound looked murky.

Art historians can easily trace, for example, what Michelangelo or Raphael gleaned from their less celebrated teachers, or argue that Manet first taught Monet, then wound up learning from his pupil. Artists still go to art school, of course, but the current trend is to regard artists who have gained celebrity status as geniuses or shooting stars on their own individual courses. \n\nAt City Without Walls, there is currently a reminder of the old way. The not-for-profit gallery runs an educational program called Art Reach, one facet of which is the mentor-student program, which pairs a professional Newark-based artist with an outstanding prospect from Newark's Arts High School. The student works as a studio assistant in return for the benefits of the mentor's expertise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Laura Whitman, Paul Provost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/style/weddings-laura-whitman-paul-provost.html","abstract":"  Laura Bowne Whitman, the cataloguer of Chinese paintings at Sotheby's in New York, and Paul Raymond Provost, a doctoral candidate in art history at Princeton University, were married yesterday.

Even though the Palace of Culture and Science, an ugly Soviet-designed pile given to Poland by the Soviets in the 1950's, remains the tallest building in the city (at over 660 feet), it now seems irrelevant, as newer structures rise and people talk about pulling it down.   In many ways, Warsaw has been too busy getting on with its own commercial life to bother with tourism. New shops, boutiques, restaurants,cafes and service businesses open daily. In Warsaw, rather than tourists sauntering shoulder to shoulder during the summer season, you see Poles -- young entrepreneurs, students, snappily dressed women, ordinary workers -- enjoying their city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"Your Home: Salability; A Slovenly House Is A Turn-Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/realestate/your-home-salability-a-slovenly-house-is-a-turn-off.html","abstract":"  COOKIE crumbs hang from the upholstery in the family room.

Moreover, what might be the effect if other major groups of people tried to cash in on affirmative action, if indeed they could prove discrimination against members of their groups? For example, on Jan. 19, 1973, the United States Department of Labor published \"Guidelines on Discrimination\" in the Federal Register. It stated in Part (b) 60-50.1 that \"Jews and Catholics, Italians, Greeks, and Slavic groups\" are victims of bias in employment because of their background.

Like the seven deadly sins, despair is a mythical state. It has no quantifiable existence; it is merely part of an allegorical world view, yet no less lethal for that. Unlike other sins, however, despair is by tradition the sole sin that cannot be forgiven; it is the conviction that one is damned absolutely, thus a repudiation of the Christian Saviour and a challenge to God's infinite capacity for forgiveness. The sins for which one may be forgiven -- pride, anger, lust, sloth, avarice, gluttony, envy -- are all firmly attached to the objects of this world, but despair seems to bleed out beyond the confines of the immediate ego-centered self and to relate to no desire, to no thing. The alleged sinner has detached himself even from the possibility of sin, and this the Catholic Church, as the self-appointed voice of God on earth, cannot allow.   Religion is organized power in the seemingly benevolent guise of the sacred, and power is, as we know, chiefly concerned with its own preservation. Its structures, its elaborate rituals and customs and Scriptures and commandments and ethics, its very nature, objectify human experience, insisting that what is out there in the world is of unquestionably greater significance than what is in here in the human spirit. Despair, surely the least aggressive of sins, is dangerous to the totalitarian temperament because it is a state of intense inwardness, thus independence. The despairing soul is a rebel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930725","headline":"In the Region: Long Island; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/realestate/in-the-region-long-island-recent-sales-462093.html","abstract":"  Bay Shore  $131,500   24 Roland Place  4-bedroom, 2-bath, 29- year-old high ranch; dining room, eat-in kitchen, den; taxes $4,700.

In its second set last Tuesday at Sweet Basil (88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village), the band didn't present even a shadow of its former self. The group now features the saxophonist James Spaulding on various instruments, often flutes, and three African-style drummers, and it opened its set with 30 minutes of Mr. Spaulding fooling around on flute over the percussion.

But whatever lies behind it, the policy announced Saturday is sure to undermine badly needed economic reform in the former Soviet Union.   Under the plan, the bank would let Russians swap small amounts of pre-1993 rubles for new rubles, but would confiscate large ruble holdings. The policy was presented as a way to clamp down on inflation by cutting down excess ruble holdings in Russia and stemming the flow of rubles from neighboring republics. But this rationale is transparently lame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930727","headline":"Chess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/arts/chess-389793.html","abstract":"  There is almost nothing you can absolutely count on in chess; there is almost nothing to which there is no exception. Take the endgame: It is the phase of a game where, in general, quite a lot of material has come off the board and there are no mating attacks. Yet often a situation has to be treated as an endgame even though just a few pawns and the queens have been exchanged. Moreover, in a position that has been dominated for more than 20 moves by slow maneuvering, the chance for a mating attack can dramatically arise, even when there are only a few pieces left on the board.   So you must be alive to whatever fluctuating concrete opportunities come up, no matter what the general situation may be. The game between the Manhattan grandmaster Joel Benjamin and Aviv Friedman of Israel in the International Open Tournament in Marigot on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, from May 1 to May 8, shows how a mating attack can stunningly intrude into a quiet endgame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930727","headline":"Observer; Failure in Chic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/opinion/observer-failure-in-chic.html","abstract":"  I learn from Styles of The Times, my favorite guide to up-to-date dressing, that it is no longer de rigueur to have your jacket sleeve sewn to your jacket.

The lines between fact and fiction have become so blurred nowadays that many readers are likely to shrug off Mr. McGinniss's startling acknowledgment that in creating his portrait of the Massachusetts Democrat, he has \"written certain scenes and described certain events from what I have inferred to be his point of view,\" despite the fact that he did not even interview the Senator for the book.

A child is better off being returned to even a mediocre home with competent natural parents than being left in an apparently superior home with adoptive parents.\n\nParadoxically, the judges made it clear that the child's best interests were not a factor in their decision; the only basis was the rights of the adults. In our legal and cultural traditions, adoption is mainly a question of the parents' interests. The child has no voice, not even an imagined one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930727","headline":"U.S. Accused Sheik Last Year Of Inciting Violence in Egypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/nyregion/us-accused-sheik-last-year-of-inciting-violence-in-egypt.html","abstract":"  A State Department report on Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman issued last year found that while the Islamic cleric had never been placed at the scene of violence committed by his supporters, \"the evidence shows a clear pattern of encouraging others to commit violent acts against Christians in Egypt and against others.\"   The report by the State Department's Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs was submitted to a Federal immigration judge in October 1992 -- four months before the bombing of the World Trade Center -- in response to Mr. Abdel Rahman's request for political asylum in the United States.
