The drummer, Steve (Skeeta) Charlot, attached funk, disco and reggae rhythms to the shuffling beat of Wilfred (Caveman) Pierre's rubboard, or metal washboard. Mr. Charlot also contributed stuttering vocals that sounded like hip-hop scratching, and engaged in uplifting call-and-response vocals with Beau Jocque.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940627","headline":"Rwandan Enemies Struggle to Define French Role","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/world/rwandan-enemies-struggle-to-define-french-role.html","abstract":"  For the moment, the French paratroops seemed like saviors to the 3,000 Tutsi men, women and children sitting wearily in the tall grass here today.

The Marrakesh accord puts limits on the rules so that countries will no longer be able to exploit them by finding dumping where none exists.

J. Simpson, some indications emerged about how both sides view -- and may try -- the case.   The prosecution said it would go beyond presenting just a skeleton of evidence, as is often the case in preliminary hearings.   \"The rules permit us just to put on the investigating officers,\" said Suzanne Childs, the spokeswoman for the District Attorney. \"But we intend to put on other witnesses.\"   When prosecutors present a parade of witnesses at a preliminary hearing, they are often trying to minimize the risk of having their case thrown out of court for lack of probable cause, even though they may tip their hand as to how much evidence they have.   But sometimes the prosecutors present a little extra evidence in an effort to force the defense to tip its hand a bit as to how the case will unfold. Defense Says It's Ready    Ms. Childs would not say why the prosecution adopted its strategy. But whatever the rationale, Mr. Simpson's defense team said it would not be fooled either way. Its investigators were seen at the suspect's home throughout the weekend, at one point taking pictures and making measurements in the driveway.   That activity was another indication that the Simpson case would probably turn in good part on large batches of physical and forensic evidence that both sides have collected, among them extensive samples of blood and tissue.   In fact, F. Lee Bailey, one of the lead defense lawyers, said this afternoon in a telephone interview that he would not be surprised if prosecutors sought to delay the preliminary hearing to be able to complete tests on some of the samples. In particular, he mentioned DNA tests, which in theory can pinpoint the origin of blood, tissue and hair but which still provoke considerable debate about their value in criminal proceedings.    \"Of course,\" Mr. Bailey added, \"if they delay, they have to let O. J. out on bail because Thursday is the deadline for getting the preliminary hearing under way.\" High-Profile Case    Mr. Simpson, whose career in professional football and on television made him a familiar national figure long before he was arrested in the slaying of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and one of her friends, Ronald L. Goldman, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bail in the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.   He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last Monday. Should he go to trial and be convicted, he could face life in prison and maybe even the death penalty.   Ms. Childs said the prosecution intended to go through with the preliminary hearing on Thursday. \"We'll be ready,\" she said.   So will the defense, Mr. Bailey said.  \"The prosecutors say they have the goods, so let 'em prove it,\" he said.  \"That's our defense. Always has been. You say I've done something criminal -- prove it.\"   If the preliminary hearing results in Mr. Simpson being bound over for trial, there will be no effort to defend him on grounds of insanity, as prosecutors -- and even a member of the defense team -- have speculated, Mr. Bailey added.   He also said no attempt would be made to change the location of a trial, despite an avalanche of pretrial publicity that led a judge to halt a grand jury inquiry last week. Insanity Plea Is Dismissed    \"Speculation about an insanity plea is nonsense because in California the prosecution has to prove its case first before you even get to that question,\" Mr. Bailey said. \"It's outrageous that they would talk this way and convict O. J. even before a trial has been held.\"   As for requesting a new location for a trial -- a change of venue, in legal parlance -- Mr. Bailey said that would not be a realistic remedy.   \"You can't get far enough away to escape the impact of nationwide, and even international, publicity,\" he said. \"This case is now known about from one coast to the other and then some.\"   Mr. Bailey said Mr. Simpson had a credible alibi as to where he was on the night of June 12, when Ms. Simpson and Mr. Goldman were fatally slashed outside Ms. Simpson's condominium in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.   \"He says he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport,\" Mr. Bailey said. \"So, if he was home, he couldn't have done it, could he?\"   Mr. Bailey also insisted that Mr. Simpson was not fleeing when he led the police on a lengthy, televised freeway cavalcade that ended with his arrest at his home, also in Brentwood. A Chase in Slow Motion    \"You can't call it a chase when it went as slow as that ride went,\" Mr. Bailey argued. \"That doesn't qualify as flight from anything. He said he was going home and he did go home. So, he wasn't running from doing something wrong.\"   The preliminary hearing will be in Los Angeles Municipal Court before Judge Patti Jo McKay, who conducted Mr. Simpson's arraignment.   In many instances, preliminary hearings last from a few minutes to a few hours, even when the charges are murder. But in a high-profile case like the Simpson case, there is always the possibility that the hearing could last days, maybe even weeks.   How long will the Simpson case hearing run?   \"As long as it runs,\" Mr. Bailey replied. \"We've got a lot of questions to ask. Let's see what they've got.\"   Most preliminary hearings result in the accused being bound over for trial.   \"First, you must establish that a crime has been committed, which is easy enough in this case, what with the pictures of the slashed bodies,\" said Bradley W. Brunon, a prominent criminal-defense lawyer in Los Angeles. \"Then you saddle suspicion on the accused, tie him or her to the crime -- suspicion at this point, not proof beyond reasonable doubt. Only about 1 in 100 times does the hearing result in the charges being thrown out.\"   Another well-known Los Angeles defense lawyer, Danny Davis, said the preliminary hearing would also offer the defense an opportunity to \"infect\" the case with error, even if Mr. Simpson were sent on to trial.   \"What the defense has a chance to do,\" he explained, \"is throw up as many roadblocks as it can and hope that somewhere along the line the judge rules wrong or the prosecution slips up. Then, when the trial actually starts, the defense can come in, point out the mistake and ask that the whole thing be thrown out. You get away with that twice -- and it has been done before -- and O. J. walks.\"   Some members of the grand jury that was taken off the Simpson case have begun to talk about their experience, though none have been willing to be identified, since grand jury business is meant to be secret.   Over the weekend, one told The Los Angeles Times that though members of the panel had been warned not to watch, listen or read news reports about the Simpson case, some jurors had nevertheless learned about the police tapes on which Mr. Simpson curses and threatens his wife.   \"The only way you could avoid it was not watch TV,\" the juror was quoted as saying. \"It was a surprise to us when it came on.\"   Another juror told the newspaper that prosecutors had almost completed presenting their evidence when the order came down for the jury to stop work on the case. The juror said the panel had been shown pictures of the bodies of Ms. Simpson and Mr. Goldman and described them as shocking.   \"This crime was such a blood mess,\" the juror added.   Still another juror said, \"This was butchery, absolute butchery.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940627","headline":"WORLD CUP '94: Sports of The Times; Americans Now Face Time in Front of Tube","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/sports/world-cup-94-sports-of-the-times-americans-now-face-time-in-front-of-tube.html","abstract":"  THE way I understand it, they must now multiply Pele's birth date times the heat on the floor of the Rose Bowl times the number of yellow warning cards Charles Oakley would receive if he were a soccer player.

And brother, are they having fun doing it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940627","headline":"Lure and Virginia Rapids Surge to Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/sports/horse-racing-lure-and-virginia-rapids-surge-to-victory.html","abstract":"  The turf champion Lure gave one of the unyielding performances of his career yesterday when he rallied in the homestretch and edged Fourstars Allstar by a nose in final strides of the $500,000 Caesars International in Atlantic City.

Another dashing performance was given at Belmont Park, where Virginia Rapids shot through the deep stretch and nipped Cherokee Run by a head in the $100,000 Tom Fool Stakes. Nearly two lengths farther back came Boundary, undefeated in five starts, his perfect record gone in the rush to the wire.

He can spend 10 minutes reducing a piece to hamburger, then turn around and be amazingly graceful and agile. One piece can have no conception at all, just four musicians bruising a tune into submission, then he'll play an oddly structured composition that suggests musical intelligence. Mr. Brubeck was the headliner at Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday night for the JVC Jazz Festival, and if it hadn't been for Slide Hampton's band, the concert would almost not have existed.   Mr. Hampton is one of jazz's finest living arrangers, and at the rare appearances he makes with his small big band, he has proved to be an exceptional leader as well. Mr. Hampton borrows from Dizzy Gillespie, Tadd Dameron and Gil Evans for his basic sound and makes it modern; a piece of his overflows with harmonies and textures and melodies, all brought together without seams. He has an idea and it permeates his work, making it consistent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940627","headline":"Old Hurdles Complicate Plan for Unified Police","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/nyregion/old-hurdles-complicate-plan-for-unified-police.html","abstract":"  The idea has enticed but eluded mayors for a decade and more: a merger of New York City's three police forces into a single superforce, as large as most nations' armies, the efficiencies saving millions of dollars and improving public safety.

Why so? One popular and persistent explanation is that music is the most indefinite, the most ambiguous of all the arts, as Oscar Wilde declared in \"The Critic as Artist,\" and is therefore attractive to those who find themselves out of sync with more conventional, clear-cut modes of expression. Encouraging an impersonal submersion in the arcana of tradition, music has historically been a refuge for homosexuals who were elsewhere silenced.   This is, of course, a very old-fashioned formulation. Twenty-five years after the Stonewall rebellion, gay men and lesbians are making a more direct engagement with the musical culture that is very much part of their heritage. In the program for the Gay Games cultural festival last week, one saw listings for the International Gay and Lesbian Baroque Orchestra, the New York City Gay Men's Chorus, a cantata entitled \"Stonewall/Flashpoint.\" Ambiguity is very much out of fashion; what was once a refuge is now a platform for public affirmation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940627","headline":"Review/Jazz Festival; Mel Torme's Own Blend Of Voice and Instrument","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/arts/review-jazz-festival-mel-torme-s-own-blend-of-voice-and-instrument.html","abstract":"  Since jazz singers are stuck between popular and jazz culture, they have always had to wrestle with the contradictions of their position. The brilliance of Mel Torme, who opened the JVC Jazz Festival on Friday night at Carnegie Hall, comes from his easy ability to reconcile the popular song and the improvisations of an instrumentalist. He has all the rhetorical tools to make a performance seem emotional, and he can take a tune apart, virtuosically.   On \"Star Dust,\" near the end of his performance, he slowed his trio down to a glacial tempo, and proceeded to sing the song as if he'd written it himself. There's a pleasure to be gained in authenticity, and Mr. Torme made the words seem autobiographical, taking his performance out of the the realm of a show and into the realm of confession, where drama lies and where contact with an audience can be made. Mr. Torme can be a stunning singer, and he made an ancient song emotional.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940627","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/27/sports/transactions-514209.html","abstract":"  WEEKEND Baseball  American League   CLEVELAND INDIANS -- Recalled Jerry DiPoto, pitcher, from Charlotte of the International League.

Souter's majority opinion was joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred separately. Justice Antonin Scalia dissented in an opinion that was also signed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas. FROM THE DECISION  By Justice Souter    The Village of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, N.Y., is a religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim, practitioners of a strict form of Judaism. The village fell within the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until a special state statute passed in 1989 carved out a separate district following village lines to serve this distinctive population. The question is whether the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is binding on the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Because this unusual act is tantamount to an allocation of political power on a religious criterion and neither presupposes nor requires governmental impartiality toward religion, we hold that it violates the prohibition against establishment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940628","headline":"Germany Holds Off South Korea","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/28/sports/world-cup-94-germany-holds-off-south-korea.html","abstract":"  The first half of this Group C match today went according to form, with the defending World Cup champion German team all but squashing the quick but inexperienced South Korean team, which has never won a cup game.

True, a lower dollar means lower U.S. living standards -- Americans can afford fewer German cameras or Japanese VCR's. And a lower dollar, by driving up the price of imports, adds to inflation. However, these impacts are small because imports account for only about 10 percent of the nation's economic activity. Besides, the dollar will almost surely continue to fall as long as the U.S. racks up huge trade deficits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940628","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/28/nyregion/no-headline-517186.html","abstract":"  \"There's something wrong when a teacher can be convicted in a court of law for selling drugs, and the school system can't dismiss him.\" -- LAWRENCE E.

Its author, Dr. Andrew Wiles of Princeton University, is working in seclusion to close the gap. A tense quietus has settled over the community of mathematicians, a few predicting failure, others expressing confidence based on the fact that Dr. Wiles's proof is already agreed to have conquered part of another major mathematical peak known as the Taniyama conjecture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940628","headline":"Death on the World Cup Express","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/28/sports/on-soccer-death-on-the-world-cup-express.html","abstract":"  The Group of Death has reached its final reckoning.

These stretches of DNA, these chattering, redundant genetic sequences, are little more than benign parasites: at some point in the distant past, they infiltrated the human chromosomes -- known in total as the human genome -- and they have been replicating slowly ever since, generation after generation. In their single-minded selfishness, they are rather like viruses, but unlike viruses they do not have the ability to dress themselves in a protein coat and leave the cell.

Opponents would prefer to keep chemical arms to deter the use of gas by others. And a recent revelation that Russia may be concealing efforts to develop advanced chemical weapons has fueled doubts about Washington's ability to verify compliance.    The U.S. has not relied on chemical weapons as a deterrent in recent years and it would be imprudent to do so now, given its superiority in conventional arms. Moreover, the U.S. would be a lot more secure with the treaty's verification provisions than without them. They provide ways to detect and stop suspicious activities by any state. The Senate would be wise to establish a global norm against chemical arms and use the treaty to enforce it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940629","headline":"Calm, Collected Katie Beers Testifies in Sex Abuse Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/29/nyregion/calm-collected-katie-beers-testifies-in-sex-abuse-case.html","abstract":"  For months, prosecutors had prepared for this day, first trying to avoid it entirely and then getting their young witness ready with a dress rehearsal in the courtroom and a luncheon with the judge.
