The other is in communicating a message (all hip-hop says something about society, even sex-obsessed songs like \"Baby Got Back\") without being overbearing, underinformed or just plain obnoxious. On Wednesday night during a sold-out performance at Tramps, Digable Planets and Spearhead managed to avoid these problems by playing with competent bands and rapping lyrics that valued form and rhythm as much as content.   Digable Planets were almost too successful in 1993: for the high-brow, their first album, \"Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space),\" was named after a Jorge Luis Borges line. For those after immediate pleasure, the beatnik jazz-style single \"Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)\" had some of the most memorable hooks of the year. But at Tramps, Digable Planets set out to prove that they weren't one-hit wonders. The group's three Brooklyn-based rappers, who perform using the names Doodlebug, Ladybug and Butterfly, performed mostly material from their second album, \"Blowout Comb\" (Pendulum/EMI), which looks to the Black Panthers and black-exploitation films of the past to find calls to revolution for the present. Behind the rappers' laid-back, tag-team poetry of kitsch and resistance, a two-man horn section shaded the music with playing that was more atmospheric than jazzy, and a drummer, guitarist, bassist and keyboardist made sure the insect rappers had a solid foundation to wander over.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950328","headline":"Building New Ballets Out of Restleness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/arts/dance-review-building-new-ballets-out-of-restleness.html","abstract":"  One thing that makes Eliot Feld a valuable choreographer is his restlessness.

Mr. Feld was at his most imaginative in \"Aurora II,\" to recorded music by Steve Reich. The set by Mark Mongold and Mr. Feld is dominated by an inclined plane that, in effect, turns the stage into a hillside. Seventeen dancers in running shoes come into view at the top of this hill, vanish from sight, reappear, slide down the slope, run back up it and slide down again. Much of the time, they perform these activities individually or in small groups.

For 15 years, she has been a virtuosic theatrical professional, appearing on Broadway (a Tony nomination for \"Our Country's Good\"), Off Broadway and regional theater, but people keep discovering her. She is not, of course, an overnight star. Hard work and a long apprenticeship have nurtured her natural talent and have allowed her to keep her new success in perspective. And she knows there are other actresses, including her friends J.

The apple sits on the grass and two little boys are tied by their wrists to a tree while their father sleeps. Whether the boys are tied for punishment or safekeeping is one of the lesser mysteries of this intentionally enigmatic and unintentionally tired Greek film.    Set in a prettily photographed village, the story focuses on the boys as adults. Stelios, the older brother, was an emotionally troubled soldier who drowned 11 years before, possibly a suicide. His body was never found. Yannis, the younger brother, is now a policeman who accidentally gets information that Stelios may be alive, possibly running guns under a false name.

In between, there were more typical annoyances: antiphonal coughing, but in greater measure than usual, and stragglers.   Mr. Rostropovich's appearances in New York as a recitalist were few during his years as the music director of the National Symphony.

The film, which runs nearly three hours, is not a conventional Bildungsroman in which a young man grows up and flees the nest on a journey of self-discovery. Although Wen Jian, the film's observer, does exactly that, by the end of the movie we have learned almost nothing about him beyond the bare facts that he is educated, successful and married with a child. Instead, the director fixes his attention on Wen Jian's father, Sega (Tsai Chen-nan) and creates a moving portrait of frustration and tenacity that the film implies echo the experience of an entire generation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950329","headline":"Global Warming:Avoid Illusory Goals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/opinion/IHT-global-warmingavoid-illusory-goals.html","abstract":"Environmentalists and officials from rich countries as well as vulnerable low-lying areas are meeting this week in Berlin to chart a course for the United Nations treaty to slow global warming.

Before the intermission, four of Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues were sandwiched between Mr. O'Riley's own transcriptions of a Bach Sonata (BWV 529) and a Toccata and Fugue (BWV 538). Shostakovich's debt to Bach is never far from the surface, yet these works spin off into harmonic worlds of their own. Even some of the fugue subjects (particularly the extraordinarily long theme in Fugue No. 16) are outlandish by Bachian standards.   Beethoven's \"Diabelli\" Variations, which took up the second half of the concert, also has connections with Bach, and not only in the Fughetta and Fugue variations. Yet a listener with the Shostakovich works still in his ears cannot help but see those pieces prefigured in, for example, the suspended time scale and harmonic daring in Variation 20, or the overt virtuosity in Variations 26 and 27.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950329","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/nyregion/metro-digest-464695.html","abstract":"  PATAKI DROPS THREAT OF SHUTDOWN    Governor Pataki backed away from his repeated threat to close down New York's state government if a budget is not enacted by April 1, the start of the fiscal year.

There is no more vital lesson for Mr. Mandela to drive home to a nation where the law was once the crude instrument of white oppression and its violation an act of justifiable defiance. The new South Africa must rest on the rule of law and no one can be above it, no matter how great her past suffering, how elevated her position or how important her role in the struggle against apartheid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950329","headline":"Gallup Journal; Crossroads Where Old And New Coexist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/us/gallup-journal-crossroads-where-old-and-new-coexist.html","abstract":"  Things were slow on Front Street, the doors of its trading posts and pawn shops and cafeterias rattling a little in the wind that blew in off the Navajo reservation 10 miles away.

They committed the fortunes of a new country to an untried system of government. But in today's sense, Washington, Hamilton, Madison and John Adams would not have called themselves revolutionaries. And they would have been suspicious of term limits. They believed they were building on the foundation of good institutions such as town meetings and colonial legislatures.\n\nBy contrast, the French Revolution was led by men who felt bound to reflect the shifting mood of the people -- a constituency they saw as enraged, embittered and always in the right. The revolutionary instrument to which the leaders of 1789-91 deferred was a \"social contract\" that forged new bonds of citizenship.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950329","headline":"Council Set to Fight Mayor On Service Cuts in Budget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/nyregion/council-set-to-fight-mayor-on-service-cuts-in-budget.html","abstract":"  Drawing battle lines over Rudolph W.

But so far, Mr. Specter's unofficial campaign has had the air of an ill-fated protest candidacy, and that is how it is regarded by many leading Republicans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950330","headline":"Remember No. 23?

This band -- which has just released a new album, \"Vivito y Coleando\" (Xenophile) -- has been marketed as a world-music group, among the few Latin bands to receive the treatment. And given the upsurge in interest in Cuban music generally, it isn't surprising that the Cespedes packed S.O.B.'s on Sunday night with a crowd intent on having a good time.   It's easy to understand the group's reputation: with four horns, a violin, several percussionists and more, it creates a big, thick sound. Though Ms. Cespedes sings religious songs occasionally, this is party music, for dancers. Ms. Cespedes is the key to it all. She's an amiable performer with a great pillar of a voice, solid and dense, and with its own chocolate texture. She bends notes slightly to pressure a changing pitch into surrendering emotion, and uses rhythm to make her phrases take on profundity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950330","headline":"1945:Food Supply: IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/opinion/IHT-1945food-supply-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON - In a discussion of the United States food supply, Mrs. Franklin D.
