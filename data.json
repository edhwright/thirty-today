The prediction was made by William Miller, a New Englander with his own interpretation of the Bible, who was convinced that the events would occur between March 1843 and March 1844.

When he died at the age of 40 in 1938 (at the hands of jealous doctors, his followers believed), he was the country's most prominent healer -- it was even said that he had cured the Mexican President of a serious illness. Since his death his cult has spread, particularly among Mexican-Americans in south Texas; tens of thousands make a pilgrimage to his tomb every year. NINO FIDENCIO: A Heart Thrown Open (Museum of New Mexico Press, $34.95) presents a reverential look at the experiences of his contemporary followers through Dore Gardner's documentary photographs of the pilgrims, and through testimonials from the women who are his mediums. Frequently these women go to Nino Fidencio's shrine (often over the objections of their husbands) seeking to cure themselves or their children of debilitating illnesses after traditional medicine has failed. If they or their children are healed, the women often pay their debt by allowing Nino Fidencio's spirit to take over their bodies so that they may cure others, and by making the arduous pilgrimage to the remote village where he lived. Few who knew Nino Fidencio are still alive, and details about his life are vague and subject to constant revision by his devotees. An essay by the folklorist Kay F. Turner offers some historical and psychological insight into the cult, but more information would have been welcome, not only about Nino Fidencio but about his followers as well. For example, biographical sketches of the people giving testimonials might have made clear that many references to Nino Fidencio are actually about a medium who has taken on his spirit in a trance. However, this book offers a fascinating glimpse into a little-known phenomenon as well as a testament to the power of belief.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Emily Bakemeier, Alain Moureaux","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/style/engagements-emily-bakemeier-alain-moureaux.html","abstract":"  Emily Paviour Bakemeier, a candidate for a Ph.D. in art history at Princeton University, is engaged to be married to Alain Gislain Moureaux, the president of Moureaux Associes, an international investigative company in Paris and in Princeton, N.J.

One is freestanding, which is mounted directly on a wall and sometimes supported by legs or a pedestal, and the other is the vanity sink, which is attached to or part of a vanity top. Installing a vanity sink is fairly easy, but installing a freestanding one can be more challenging.   To remove a sink before installing a new one, first shut off the water supplying the faucets or the main valve near the water meter. Next, open the faucets to drain remaining water. Then use a basin wrench to loosen the nuts beneath the sink that fasten the supply tubes to the faucet's base. To use a basin wrench, fit it around the nut so that turning the handle counterclockwise tightens the jaw. Otherwise, the tool will slip.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Sally MacCowatt And Josh Black","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/style/engagements-sally-maccowatt-and-josh-black.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Haskell P.

There is one aspect I would like to clarify. While Ms. Wade wrote that passengers' personal wheelchairs are \"destined for the cargo compartment sooner or later,\" in actuality people who use manual wheelchairs are most often able to stow them in the aircraft cabin. The Access Act requires airlines to permit the stowing of one folding wheelchair in the cabin closet or other approved storage area. Passengers who board their flight ahead of time may place their wheelchair in the cabin closet with priority over carry-on items from the same airport, and airlines cannot count wheelchairs and other assistive devices toward a passenger's carry-on limit. When a personal wheelchair is stowed in the baggage compartment, air carriers must insure that it receives priority.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"A Dancer Dances, Against All Odds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/nyregion/a-dancer-dances-against-all-odds.html","abstract":"  DAWN STORRS could hardly have been happier.

Our response to these alarms was a mix of set purpose (to see tombs, temples and monuments we'd known about since the third grade), skepticism (there had only been a scattering of incidents and no evidence that tourists from other countries were staying away) and a rough actuarial calculation that told us that Egypt was a safer bet than Mexico (famous for bus plunges), Milan or Route 6, the murderous highway that runs the length of Cape Cod.

A young black in the South Bronx who wrote poetry, took piano lessons, played baseball, practiced karate and aspired to be somebody -- that's who Mickey thought he was.   Now Mickey -- Big Mickey -- lives in an exclusive Manhattan doorman building where, he recalls, his \"mother toiled as a domestic.\" That's just the place to be somebody. But Big Mickey no longer thinks so. His son has been beaten up by a gang in the subway. \"I stand here waiting to hear the outcome of his operation,\" Big Mickey tells the audience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Pedophiles and the Law","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/books/l-pedophiles-and-the-law-76894.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I would like to respond to your review of my \"Sexual Science and the Law\" (Jan. 31).   I did not conclude in the book that \"we have no reliable psychiatric evidence that  [ child-adult sexual ]  relations harm children.\" I reported the findings of a 1986 review of the scientific literature that maintained that \"from one-fifth to two-fifths of abused children seen by clinicians manifest pathological disturbance.\" I reported the findings of a 1991 review that maintained \"there is still a lack of consensus regarding    the proportion    of children who have been psychologically harmed\" (emphasis added). Regarding incest experiences, I concluded, \"   Not all    reports . . . document harm\" (emphasis added). For homosexual child-adult experiences, I concluded, \"   Not all    . . . are necessarily viewed by the younger person as traumatic\" (emphasis added). And I noted that two factors seem to be associated with more harm to the child -- when the sexual contact is forced and when the adult is the father. The reviewer makes it appear that I support the extremist views held by pedophile groups like the North American Man-Boy Love Association.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"A School's Role in Getting Students to the Stage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/nyregion/a-school-s-role-in-getting-students-to-the-stage.html","abstract":"  THEIR names pop up regularly now in theater reviews, news of the film world and celebrity profiles.

Henderson used the projects to advance jazz harmony with gorgeously intelligent, occasionally dissonant tunes that quickly became standards. In an era of polarization, the music preached balance, mixing experimentation with hard-driving swing.   As an improviser, Henderson used a harsh tone and blunt rhythms. His solos were architectural, with recognizable elements -- a be-bop line, some trills, a stairlike sequence of notes -- adding up to a formidable new style. As aware of the expressionistic avant-garde of the 1960's as he was of the be-boppers who had come before him, Henderson picked ideas from both camps, merging textural extremes with sophisticated harmony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"DANCE;\nTroupe With a Smooth and Breezy Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/nyregion/dance-troupe-with-a-smooth-and-breezy-style.html","abstract":"THERE are no swans on the programs of the American Repertory Ballet Company.

Many more are to be found in public collections, notably those at the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and, in New Jersey, the Newark and State Museums.

His residential architecture beckoned to city dwellers with the promise of a bold adventure in living that could be theirs if they would leave the city behind. For Wright, the city was \"the triumph of the herd instinct,\" \"the great mouth,\" \"the Moloch that knows no god but More.\" His houses offered the hearty independence of life on the prairie, but with all the modern conveniences. As the century unfolded, increasing numbers of Americans responded to his call.

She was full term, weighed 8 pounds, but as soon as her umbilical court was cut, she turned blue. Doctors diagnosed hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, one of the most common and serious heart defects in infants. Catherine's aorta was one-tenth the normal size, meaning oxygenated blood could not get to her body. Her heart had no left ventricle.   Until a decade ago, these otherwise robust-looking infants died within days. But now a few hospitals will operate. The procedure is complex, expensive, high-risk. About 25 percent of the babies survive. For this reason many hospitals avoid the operation -- it pushes up their mortality rates. The procedure involves rerouting the heart's flow of blood, sewing the pulmonary artery to the aorta and getting the right ventricle to do the left's work. It's like rerouting the traffic pattern of a complicated highway cloverleaf -- say where the Grand Central Parkway meets the Interboro -- except you're working on a heart the size of a plum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Maori Art Comes to Chicago","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/travel/travel-advisory-maori-art-comes-to-chicago.html","abstract":"  At dawn on March 9, more than 30 Maori people who have traveled from New Zealand for the occasion will hold a private ceremony to dedicate the newly restored Maori meeting house at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.

With one blow, the explosion, apparently originating on the second floor of the garage, damaged the complex's emergency command center; pulverized the control that governs it's ventilation system, which could have cleared away the smoke; severed five of the eight main lines carrying power to the twin towers; cracked water pipes, flooding the backup generators in the basement, and cut many of the center's communication lines, making it impossible for many of the workers trapped in the building to call out. Evacuation Criticized    After feeling their way down dozens of flights of steps in smoky darkness without benefit of emergency instructions, many office workers emerged from the towers on Friday criticizing the Port Authority for lacking proper evacuation procedures in its huge complex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Around New England, Main Street Faces Peril","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/us/around-new-england-main-street-faces-peril.html","abstract":"  There has been a lot of snow here this winter, but people in this declining, 240-year-old factory town are not much concerned with the weather or the Celtics or President Clinton's new tax plan.

Their rich overlay of cultural allusions extends from ancient Etruscan pottery to neo-classical German cityscapes; from Napoleon's sarcophagus to the interiors of Russian palaces. While taking a playful view of the past, the artist is also commenting on the recent collapse of communist Europe.   Mr. Lollar, a resident of Yonkers who heads the ceramics department at Columbia University, is represented in the permanent collections of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the American Craft Museum, both in Manhattan. He is better known, however, as a designer of ceramic bas- relief for installation in corporate architecture than as a vessel maker. In this show, his affinity for architecture has converged with his interest in historic presentational objects.   Three years ago, in Prague and Vienna, Mr. Lollar visited major museum collections of commemorative vessels, a genre in which the forms are derived from functional objects but not meant for use. He also visited a hunting lodge in the Grunewald, a wooded park in Berlin, to see a collection of tureens that had been commissioned as gifts for exchange among members of the aristocracy. These encounters with objects from the past directly influenced the eight pieces in the show, the artist said in an interview.   Several are based on the tureen, a deep covered dish for serving soup or stew to a crowd. Although its antecedents were communal bowls used by early humans, in 18th-century Europe the tureen had become a luxury object as well as a tour de force for pottery designers. Mr. Lollar has also used the kylix, a shallow drinking vessel used in ancient Greece, and historic vase forms as points of departure.   Mr. Lollar's complex symmetrical forms, all heroic in scale and standing on bases suggesting pedestals or columns, project the formality of architectural monuments. Yet there is a gutsy playfulness in such details as a series of finials rising to a bronze eagle on the handle of a lid, which seem intricately wrought but retain the memory of clay's pliability. The works are further enlivened with inscriptions executed in spontaneous linear strokes. Frequently depicting specific urban vistas, these images reflect the artist's interest in early 20th-century German woodcuts.   While Mr. Lollar obviously respects history, he freely combines its ingredients for expressive purposes. This exhibition as a whole seems to comment on the persistence of cultural fusion.    This is evident, for example, in \"Schinkel Sarcophagus,\" at 40 inches high the largest, most imposing work and the show's centerpiece. Here, the tapering rectangular walls echo the shape of Napoleon's burial vault, while the image of a plaza etched in sgraffito (a method of scratching through a layer of glaze to reach the color of the clay beneath it) is of a plaza in what was East Berlin. This same scene had been depicted on a 19th-century tureen, a wedding gift for a Dutch prince and a Prussian princess; both Mr. Lollar's piece and the historic tureen, which is in the Campbell Museum in Camden, N.J., are embellished with gold accents. Areas of green glaze that resemble blowups of faux marble surfaces refer to the malachite interiors of Russian palaces. Karl Friedrich Schinkel, for whom the piece is named, was a neo-classical German architect prominent in the 19th century.   Equally complex in cross references, \"Dem Deutschen Volke\" is a boat-shape tureen that commemorates the unification of Berlin. As might be expected, a view of the city appears on one curving wall of the vessel. On the other, however, are surprising images of pyramids and sphinxes. The artist says those recall the European fascination with civilizations brought to light by 19th-century excavations.   Another telescopic view of history is seen in \"Etruscan Vessel,\" in which the form and earthenware surface were inspired by the ancient Etruscan vases that Mr. Lollar saw in an Italian museum. Here, the jolting element is a band of painted silhouettes of figures displaying courtly manners in Baroque European costumes.   Shown side by side, two pieces based on the kylix, a classical Greek predecessor of the chalice, provide a striking contrast in spirit. Despite the fact that the German words within the \"Mozart Kylix\" were from a requiem by the composer, this cup in light earthen tones on a gold pedestal seems lyrical compared with the \"Nicholas II Kylix.\" That work, glazed in heavier-looking blues and greens, commemorates recent disclosures regarding the last czar's death.   Although the experience of viewing Mr. Lollar's work is enriched by tracking down references and reflecting on their relationships, the forms themselves are compelling enough to demand a second look. Charcoal and watercolor drawings of several of the vessels, with collaged photocopies of the buildings represented in clay, add a significant dimension to the show.   The exhibition will continue through April 25. The museum, at 511 Warburton Avenue, is open Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Fridays from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M.

We seem to have entered a world supermarket. Compact disks and tapes and concerts have conspired to create an abundance of choices and a confluence of styles. Just as African drumming and Balinese gamelan music have influenced Western art and popular music, Western sounds have entered other cultures. In the 1850's, the King of Madagascar sent musicians to train in Europe so they could return to play Mozart and Rossini. Now Western pop has also become part of the African patrimony.   But the disciplined study of the music of different cultures has been an exclusively Western preoccupation. Rousseau's 1768 Dictionary of Music included examples of Chinese and North American Indian music. Theoretical studies of scales tried to take the systems of other cultures into account. (Scales, said one theorist in 1885, are \"very diverse, very artificial and very capricious.\") And it was in the West that the effort to record and analyze the wide variety of musical systems became a profession, one that was given a name only in 1950: ethnomusicology.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Turn Up the Amps and Pass the Maalox","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/movies/television-view-turn-up-the-amps-and-pass-the-maalox.html","abstract":"  The camera pans in to find Alistair Cooke wearing tie-dyes on a set recreating the Fillmore East.

Amid a farrago of ditties and dances, detritus of early 20th-century popular culture, Poulenc announces himself by stealth, in dissonant spasms and general stylistic disorientation. In a Wednesday night double bill of \"Les Mamelles de Tiresias\" and \"La Voix Humaine,\" two short operas composed in 1944 and 1958, the Juilliard Opera valiantly tried to capture this elusive voice but fell short. \"Mamelles\" was especially problematic: taking words and music at face value, it plunged headlong into banality.    The greatest challenge of \"Mamelles\" is its text, a \"Surrealist drama\" by the turn-of-the-century poet Guillaume Apollinaire. The tale of Tiresias originally appears in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\": a man is transformed into a woman, then finds himself a man again and informs the curious gods that womanhood was preferable. Apollinaire wove this androgynous parable into a wildly absurd operetta plot. Empowered by the rhetoric of sexual liberation, a woman named Therese wills herself into manhood (her breasts float away as balloons); her frustrated husband consequently turns himself into a woman and gives birth to dozens of babies, all for France's glory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930301","headline":"Book Critics Honor 'All the Pretty Horses' in Fiction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/01/books/book-critics-honor-all-the-pretty-horses-in-fiction.html","abstract":"  Cormac McCarthy's novel \"All the Pretty Horses\" (Alfred A.

At Gulfstream Park here on Saturday, in one section of the Fountain of Youth Stakes, the favored Silver of Silver ran third, while in the other section, Great Navigator finished second and Itsal'lknownfact ran sixth. At Santa Anita, meanwhile, two even higher-ranking prospects for the Derby were far outdistanced in the San Rafael Stakes: the favored Stuka finishing in third place, 12 lengths behind, and the second choice, Art of Living, fifth in the field of six. Storm Tower Undefeated    Amid the debris, the winners were Storm Tower and Duc d'Sligovil in the two sections of the Fountain of Youth, and Devoted Brass in the San Rafael. And in terms of advancing on the road to Louisville, where the 119th Kentucky Derby will be run May 1, the most progress was probably made by Storm Tower, who is now undefeated in four starts in a brief career that began last June at Monmouth Park in New Jersey.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930301","headline":"Today's Forecast: Hurricane George","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/01/sports/baseball-today-s-forecast-hurricane-george.html","abstract":"  The news release was copied and quickly distributed to reporters early this morning, establishing the guidelines for the return of George Steinbrenner to the Yankees on Monday.

But the students' annual spring concert, presented only in Westchester at the college's theater complex, is more difficult to get to.  And that is a pity. The performances can be eye opening when they feature revivals of familiar dances. The dancers are skilled and fresh, and perform without a trace of affectation.    This year's program, which will be repeated Thursday through Sunday at the college's Performing Arts Center (735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase), opens with \"Forest,\" an exquisite modern dance piece choreographed by Robert Cohan, the director of the London Contemporary Dance Theater and a former Martha Graham principal.

The five commodities exchanges are reopening in a smaller building and big brokerage houses have arranged alternative locations. But other tenants face uncertainty and possible large financial losses, even though state and city officials do not expect lasting economic damage or a flight of panicked tenants. A1.   BOMB REPORTED MADE OF DYNAMITE   Law-enforcement officials say that the bomb that devastated the World Trade Center apparently was made of conventional dynamite, not a tightly controlled military explosive like the plastic favored by terrorists. And Police Commissioner Kelly disclosed that investigators believe more than one person was involved. A1.   SUDDEN TRAUMA AND SLOW RECOVERY   As they gain a clearer sense of the obstacles they face, from the lack of heat to water in the basement, Port Authority officials say it will be more than a week before the World Trade Center is fully revived. B5.   Since attention is a main goal of terrorism, investigators are baffled by the silence following the explosion. None of the more than 50 callers who have claimed responsibility has presented convincing proof. B4.    Eight years ago, an anti-terrorist task force told the Port Authority that the trade center's parking garage was vulnerable to a bomb attack and should be closed to the public. Additional safety systems were also suggested. But most of the key recommendations were never adopted. B5.   With a tiny blue hard hat perched atop his head, Stanley Brezenoff has been forced to occupy the very hot seat at the helm of the disaster reaction effort. His long experience in city government has proven to be good training. B4.   Service on PATH and New York City subway lines should be fully restored, making for a fairly normal rush hour in lower Manhattan. B5. NEW YORK CITY WINNERS AND LOSERS ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY   A Federal judge's decision about the sponsorship of this year's St. Patrick's Day Parade appears to hand total victory to the Ancient Order of Hibernians, giving them control of the parade on their own terms, and equally complete defeat to Mayor Dinkins and the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization. But on closer inspection the lines between winners and losers become blurred in the shifting ethnic and political mix of New York City. B3.   LIBERAL IMAGE IN DISPUTE   A larger proportion of New Yorkers now own their homes or apartments than at any other time in the 20th century. Owners tend to be more politically conservative than renters, which may help explain the city's recent conflicts over traditional social values. Metro Matters, B3.   A foundation fills the wishes of hundreds of seriously ill children. B2. REGION HOSPITALS NO, BUT JOBS YES   As New York State struggles to close down its sprawling mental hospitals and move the resources into smaller community programs, legislators who favor the policy in theory sometimes balk when it means loss of funds to their home districts. One hospital with fewer than a dozen patients is to be closed this year, and two others are on the list for closing -- bringing angry lobbying from workers and local legislators. B7.   AWAITING THE CALL IN HARTFORD   If Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut is thinking about accepting a job in the Clinton Administration, he isn't discussing the idea with his lieutenant governor, Eunice S. Groark. She's the one who would succeed him. In Hartford, state officials say they've heard talk that the governor's wanted in Washington, but nothing's definite. B7.

Unlike Lully's music, which had defined French opera for the early 18th century, it was extreme, full of jarring modulations and exclamations, expressions that strained the limits of taste. Rameau raised the temperature of French opera.    Some of those musical effects could be heard in a marvelous concert performance of \"Castor et Pollux\" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Friday night, when William Christie came from Paris with his accomplished group of early-music performers, Les Arts Florissants. Opening a weekend of performances (with Rameau's \"Indes Gallantes\" on Saturday night and a repeat of \"Castor\" on Sunday afternoon), the only regret was that the musical drama couldn't have been made visible as well as audible. The visits of Mr. Christie, now becoming annual under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy, are among the musical highlights of New York's music seasons; a year ago, Mr. Christie's and Jean-Marie Villegier's full-scale production of Lully's \"Atys\" was hauntingly beautiful; the opera's mythic tale of stifled love was transformed into a formal ballet of moves and countermoves at the court of Versailles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930301","headline":"Review/Theater; Long Ago, Far Away: Ragtime's Flowering","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/01/theater/review-theater-long-ago-far-away-ragtime-s-flowering.html","abstract":"  Pairing Eric Overmyer's linguistic virtuosity with Scott Joplin's scintillating syncopation sounds like a promising theatrical idea.

This is a dreary, downbeat attempt at musical biography.   In his play (at Playwrights Horizons), Mr. Overmyer barely taps Joplin's extraordinary life. The story of how this itinerant turn-of-the-century musician moved out of saloons and bawdy houses and became the king of ragtime is told more evocatively in the 1950 book \"They All Played Ragtime,\" by Rudi Blesh and Harriet Janis, and there is also an interesting historical collage of facts and photographs in the lobby of the theater.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930301","headline":"Sports of The Times; McGirt and His Obstacles: One Savvy Boxer, One Sore Shoulder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/01/sports/sports-of-the-times-mcgirt-and-his-obstacles-one-savvy-boxer-one-sore-shoulder.html","abstract":"  IN the ring at Bufano's gym, Buddy McGirt, wearing a red T-shirt and tight royal blue sweat pants, had been using his left jab easily, peppering his left-handed sparring partners for six rounds.

The musicians' wages, like those of all Polish orchestras and formerly state-supported educated professions, are well below the national average, which is itself grievously below Western standards in an economy crippled by a half-century of Communism and today's soaring inflation.

So there was a decidedly ho-hum attitude toward the unfamiliar young Bavarian National Ballet when it quietly sidled into the New York State Theater last week. The first performances were something of a letdown. But by the end of the week, the first of two in this New York debut season, ovations greeted the company at its curtain calls, and word began to spread. There were compelling foreign principals like Kirill Melnikov and Evelyn Hart. The repertory was interesting and wide-ranging.   But the big discovery was the engaging, skillful troupe itself, filled with well-trained, fresh young performers who are steadily winning New Yorkers' hearts. The Bavarian dancers are bringing vibrant new life to the repertory of modern European ballets that will be seen this week: Ray Barra's \"Don Quixote,\" John Cranko's \"Eugene Onegin\" and one-act dances by Hans van Manen, Uwe Scholz and Jiri Kylian.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/sports/transactions-545793.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League   BALTIMORE ORIOLES -- Promoted Mitch Bibb, trainer with Frederick of the Carolina league, to Bowie of the Eastern League.

But despite a state court ruling last week vindicating the public's right to know, the State Senate, dominated by Republicans, still won't disclose the figures. That insults taxpayers who are asked to foot the bill for a dubious perk that discourages competitive elections by giving incumbents an unfair leg up.   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by a losing Democratic Senate candidate, Michael Siris, who said he was aware of at least 16 publicly financed mailings last year by his Republican opponent, Senator Michael Tully Jr. of Nassau County -- an apparent violation even of the Senate's overly generous limits on mail. When the Senate rejected a request for basic data on Mr. Tully's mailing habits -- unsurprising, since members themselves are denied such records -- Mr. Siris brought suit under the state's Freedom of Information Law.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/nyregion/c-corrections-825193.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Feb. 13 about Dr. Howard A.

Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22.     Like his first two books, \"Our House in the Last World\" (1983) and \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\" (1989), Oscar Hijuelos's latest novel, \"The 14 Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien,\" is a family saga, one of those commodious, emotionally generous books that immerse us in a well-upholstered fictional world. Once again, we are given a richly colored portrait of immigrant life in the United States; once again we are shown how familial hopes, dreams, yearnings and sadnesses are handed down generation to generation.   Whereas \"Mambo Kings,\" which won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, was an insistently male book, focusing on the sexual and romantic adventures of two Cuban immigrant brothers, \"The 14 Sisters\" is a novel about women, a novel examining the lives and loves of the Montez and O'Brien women.   Though many of its central characters suffer from a lingering melancholy reminiscent of that possessed by Nestor, one of the two brothers in \"The Mambo Kings,\" the book is less concerned with loss and missed opportunities than its predecessor. Death, divorce and illness all take their toll here, but \"The 14 Sisters\" takes a longer view of family life than \"The Mambo Kings,\" and its vision is ultimately more redemptive, concerned in the end, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \"Love in the Time of Cholera,\" with the cyclical nature of time, and the enduring possibilities of love.   Moving back and forth in time, \"The 14 Sisters\" begins, more or less, with the story of Nelson O'Brien, a young Irish boy, whose dreams of America are based on the penny novels he has read about Wild Bill Hickok and Jesse James. In time, Nelson emigrates to the United States, settles in a small Pennsylvania town and, in 1898 after the death of his beloved sister Kate, goes to Cuba to take photographs of the Spanish-American War.   There, Nelson meets the beautiful, dreamy 16-year-old Mariela Montez, and for 27 Sundays in a row he pays her court. He tells her about his house in Pennsylvania \"deep in the heart of America, where people could do as they pleased and there was no war,\" and she dreams of a good life with this earnest, sad-eyed man. For their wedding, Nelson gives her a telescope so that she might gaze upon the stars, and he introduces the shy young woman to the unexpected pleasures of his bed.   Their passion is enthusiastic, and almost mythically fecund. In the ensuing years in America, Mariela will have 14 daughters, and finally, after all these girls, a son.   Though we wonder how Mr. Hijuelos will ever be able to keep so many siblings clearly sorted out in his mind, he's able to implant a firm sense of each and every one of them in our imaginations. There's Margarita, the oldest and in many ways the novel's presiding spirit, who makes an early, unfortunate marriage, and spends years regretting her mistake, only to discover, late in life, the joys of love and independence. It is Margarita who will keep the members of this huge, sprawling family in touch with one another, and Margarita who will imagine her parents' lives together, and preserve them, along with the lives of her siblings, through the willful exercise of memory.   After Margarita, there's Isabel, the blond, Irish-looking sister, plump and enamored of food, who will find a husband and a home in Cuba. Maria, the third sister, and the twins, Olga and Jacqueline, are the musically gifted ones -- the family's \"Three Nightingales\" -- who will find fulfilling careers in show business. Then there's the beauteous Helen, appropriately named after a bottle of Helen of Troy Beauty Pomade; plump little Irene; the angry, pensive Sarah, and Patricia, the sister born with a gift for second sight.   Veronica, named after the saint, will live up to her name and marry a homeless man she has helped find shelter. Marta and Carmen will remain homebodies for many years, before finding happiness in California. The promiscuous Violeta will eventually abandon her hectic social life to become a minister's wife. And Gloria will struggle for years with her incestuous love for her brother, Emilio, a handsome, introspective boy who will grow up to become a small-time movie star.   In relating the tangled history of the O'Brien-Montez clan, Mr. Hijuelos moves confidently from one character's story to the next, leaping ahead in time to foreshadow the future, then jumping backward in time to show us the seeds of hope and despair. He subtly reveals the ways in which the sisters' choices echo -- or counterpoint -- the choices of their siblings, and he demonstrates, as well, the ways in which their lives both embody and contradict the dreams of their parents.   Toward the end of the book, Mr. Hijuelos's narrative becomes a little rushed, and his quickening litany of developments in the sisters' lives -- alcoholism, addiction to Valium, subscriptions to spiritist newsletters, affairs with younger men -- can sound suspiciously like an inventory of topics on a talk show. The reader, however, never really minds, so persuasive and generous is his delineation of the family's life. Indeed, one finishes \"The 14 Sisters\" reluctantly, the way one finishes a long letter from a beloved family member, eager for all the news not to end.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"By Design; Shielding the Sheer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/style/by-design-shielding-the-sheer.html","abstract":"  The idea behind the new \"see through\" styles is to appear tantalizingly bare but, in truth, to be decently attired.

Actually, the Yankee owner made it to within 30 feet of the stadium entrance near first base before being besieged by photographers, reporters and television crews who stopped him and forced him to answer questions for an hour while he was flanked by two Fort Lauderdale police officers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"Multiple Sclerosis Vaccine Shows Early Promise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/science/multiple-sclerosis-vaccine-shows-early-promise.html","abstract":"  AN oral vaccine against multiple sclerosis has proved promising enough in a small pilot trial to merit broader testing, scientists have reported. The novel approach plays upon the unique way that immune cells in the stomach respond to food.    If the ingested vaccine can be fine-tuned to heighten its effectiveness, it could result in a cheap, safe and easy way of treating the degenerative central-nervous system disorder, as well as other autoimmune diseases like juvenile diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or uveitis, an eye disorder, the researchers suggested.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"No One Said Lorenzo's Oil Could Prevent Rare Nerve Disease; Earned a Valid Place","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/opinion/l-no-one-said-lorenzo-s-oil-could-prevent-rare-nerve-disease-earned-a-valid-place-862693.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I am the pediatric neurologist who initially diagnosed Lorenzo Odone as having adrenoleukodystrophy in 1984 and was in close contact with him and his family in subsequent years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930302","headline":"Let's Stop Guessing About Women's Health; Making Decisions Alone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/02/opinion/l-let-s-stop-guessing-about-women-s-health-making-decisions-alone-855393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Our Breast Cancer\" (Op-Ed, Feb. 20) by Douglas S.
