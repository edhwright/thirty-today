But with a complex custody battle swirling around him, the fate of the boy, Shai Fhima, remained as uncertain yesterday as it was two years ago when he first disappeared. And even the facts surrounding his disappearance remained murky, as Shai and the rabbi, Shlomo Helbrans, continued to insist that Rabbi Helbrans had done nothing wrong, despite the guilty plea. Deal With District Attorney    Rabbi Helbrans offered the plea of guilty to a charge of conspiracy to kidnap in the fourth degree in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The plea was part of an intricate arrangement with the Brooklyn District Attorney that will give the rabbi a sentence of five years' probation and 250 hours of community service. But under the terms of the agreement, the rabbi and another man, Mordechai Weisz, who will also receive five years' probation for the kidnapping conspiracy, did not admit that they had committed any of the specific acts with which they were charged.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"By Design; From the Far East","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/style/by-design-from-the-far-east.html","abstract":"  The newest jackets and shirts for spring (it will get here eventually, honest) are inspired by traditional costumes of the Far East.

Greece's Western allies understand that Athens has had serious problems with Macedonia in the past. But they are losing patience with Greece's bullying tactics against a much weaker neighbor already suffering ethnic tensions.   Ancient Macedonia was the homeland of Alexander the Great. Modern Macedonia was, for most of this century, part Greek, part Yugoslav. During the Greek civil war of the late 1940's, Yugoslavia allied itself with the losing Communist side, and at one point Marshal Tito tried to assert his authority over all of Macedonia. Greece, not yet a NATO member and threatened by what seemed to be global Communism, was traumatized.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"Through Bosnian Smoke, Russians and Serbs Turn to the West; Give Clinton Credit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/opinion/l-through-bosnian-smoke-russians-and-serbs-turn-to-the-west-give-clinton-credit-402710.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As an American businessman stationed in Paris and one who has helped United States physicians and medical supplies enter Sarajevo, I believe the Clinton Administration has been 100 percent correct in keeping our soldiers out of the former Yugoslavia as long as possible.

The results were spectacular. As familiar as Mr. Kissin's fabulous technique has become, it is hard to take for granted; he is, after all, only 22.   Still, the less showy moments earlier in the evening were almost more impressive in their maturity. Mr. Kissin began with excellent performances of two Schumann works. At the start of the \"Arabesque\" (Op. 18), all the rippling notes seemed to dissolve in eloquent long-breathed phrases. The outer movement of the Fantasy in C (Op. 17) had a fine reflective quality; in the middle movement, some smudges at the first return of the big chords came as welcome reassurance that Mr. Kissin is only human, however much the later evidence seemed to suggest otherwise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940309","headline":"ISRAELI ARMY SAYS SECURITY WAS LAX AT MASSACRE SITE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/09/world/israeli-army-says-security-was-lax-at-massacre-site.html","abstract":"  Israel began its formal inquiry into the Hebron massacre today with the army commander for the West Bank testifying that a breakdown had occurred in security arrangements that could have prevented the mass killing of Palestinian worshipers by an Israeli settler.

In October 1945, while I was aiding Holocaust survivors for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Linz, Austria, Oskar Schindler asked for and received our help, based on documents that he had saved hundreds of Jews by giving them employment in his factory in Cracow -- verified to me by survivors. Schindler expressed to me his fear of the revenge of the Nazis, and therefore wanted help to obtain work in Bavaria, where he thought it would be safer because United States occupation troops would be there for some time to come.   \"Schindler's List,\" Thomas Keneally's book, refers to what happened in 1963, when Schindler was hissed on the streets of Frankfurt and even had to pay damages to a German worker he punched for calling him a \"Jew kisser.\" Bitter irony that in 1994, as you point out, fear of Nazi revenge has not been eradicated.   Mr. Keneally's book accurately reports that in 1949 the Joint Distribution Committee gave Schindler financial aid for his nutria farm in Argentina, which failed, and in 1959 for his cement factory in Frankfurt, which also failed.    These modest gestures of support were by no means compensation for Schindler's heroic achievements, but, long before Mr. Keneally and Mr. Spielberg made Oskar Schindler's name an international byword, the American Jewish community demonstrated its gratitude to this unusual man.
