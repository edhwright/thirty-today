Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter each filed a dissenting opinion. FROM THE DECISION By Justice O'Connor   This case involves two of the most complex and sensitive issues this Court has faced in recent years: the meaning of the constitutional \"right\" to vote, and the propriety of race-based state legislation designed to benefit members of historically disadvantaged racial minority groups.                     . . .

As played by the acclaimed pipa virtuoso Tang Liang-xing, the music's phrases were delicate and full of nuance. His style is never sentimental or exaggerated; it is always warm and dramatic. His left hand, pressing the frets on this traditional Chinese lute, bent the instrument's strings to create microtonal nuances and shaped a subtle vibrato that gave vocal character to melodic lines; his right hand, each finger equipped with a plectrum, gave the music a rhythmic crispness, articulating multiple voices in what is often considered monophonic music. In these ancient pieces, the instrument never spoke above a mezzo-piano, but it also never had to; its energy was contained by an almost ceremonial restraint.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930629","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/29/nyregion/news-summary-881193.html","abstract":"  International A3-9  EVIDENCE ON BUSH PLOT GREW  The Clinton Administration delayed its formal finding that Iraq was behind a plot to kill former President Bush until it was absolutely certain, officials said.

Kramer  409 pages. Viking Press. $23.   In the first of the fascinating case histories that are the building blocks of this thoughtful study of the controversial antidepressant drug Prozac, Peter D. Kramer, a psychiatrist, describes a patient he calls Sam, a successful architect of Austrian descent with a quirky interest in pornography, which he considered the emblem of his independent spirit. After exploring the possible causes of a deep depression Sam had fallen into, the author prescribed Prozac (known generically as fluoxetine), which was developed in the 1970's by a team of chemists at the Eli Lilly Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930701","headline":"Political Ally Shifts, and A-Tests Halt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/world/political-ally-shifts-and-a-tests-halt.html","abstract":"  In deciding not to seek immediate Congressional approval for more nuclear tests, President Clinton appears to have been swayed by opposition from an unexpected source: the Energy Department, which runs the national laboratories that conduct the tests and have been their biggest proponents.   Given the department's change of heart and increasing skepticism in Congress, Administration officials said, the President chose to overrule the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff rather than risk an open fight with fellow Democrats over a plan that left him uneasy. Only weeks ago, the Pentagon and other security agencies had unanimously endorsed a plan calling for 15 more nuclear tests by 1996.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930701","headline":"A Critic Unleashed; Curiale Vents Frustration at Empire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/nyregion/a-critic-unleashed-curiale-vents-frustration-at-empire.html","abstract":"  When Salvatore R.

But often TV shows a skewed world, populated disproportionately by serial killers, mob hit men and done-wrong women with hot tempers and even hotter guns. (Amy Fisher, a.k.a. the Long Island Lolita, was recently catnip to not one but three networks.) And its audience is all too likely to include children for whom aggression on the screen may make real aggression acceptable.   Many parents think so, and many studies support their fears.

Mr. Ehrlich and the saxophonist Stan Strickland, who lead the Marty Ehrlich Quartet, have been performing together since the early 1970's, and their improvisations together are bizarrely telepathic. Their lines tangle up, riddled with accidental harmonies, only to dissolve into a single high, keening note that then gives way to knots of sound.   Mr. Ehrlich, who was opening up a triple bill at the Knitting Factory, writes pieces that have mapped the vast plains opened up by Ornette Coleman; his compositions use odd, shifting meters, and everything from a chamber-music cleanliness and precision to full-bore blowing.

The policy was drawn from recommendations developed by a group of scientists and was presented to the timber industry, environmentalists and members of Congress from Washington and Oregon. It is the Clinton Administration's first important attempt to walk the fine line between economic growth and environmental protection.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930701","headline":"'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Means Everybody","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/opinion/l-don-t-ask-don-t-tell-means-everybody-472393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As the political jockeying continues over the issue of how to acknowledge the presence of gays in the military (news article, June 23), the problem appears to be the impractical desire of some to restrict nondisclosure solely to gays themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930701","headline":"Environment Deserves Higher Albany Priority","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/opinion/l-environment-deserves-higher-albany-priority-474093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Goodbye, Adirondacks?\" by John B.

The festival is a curious hybrid. At a time when period instruments are the norm for Baroque performance, the Bach Aria Group continues to perform and teach the music mostly on modern ones. And the festival's philosophy of performance style is clearly informed by modern concepts of stylistic propriety, tempered by the notion that an interpreter's job is to make the music affecting, not to follow rules slavishly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930701","headline":"Clinton Will End U.S. Opposition To Vietnam Loans, Officials Say","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/world/clinton-will-end-us-opposition-to-vietnam-loans-officials-say.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration is planning to drop its opposition to loans to Vietnam by international lending institutions, Administration officials said today.

A leading force in the busy Ohio dance scene, the troupe has gained additional renown from its association with the American Dance Festival and programs designed to educate and familiarize audiences around the world with classics of American modern dance created by black choreographers. The company returned to the festival last week, confirming its solid status as a major American modern-dance company in a program presented at Page Auditorium at Duke University, where the festival is held each summer.    One of the company's greatest strengths is that its 16 performers act as well as they dance. That balance was suggested on Saturday night in the choice of dances on the program, which opened with Dianne McIntyre's \"Take Off From a Forced Landing,\" the story of a family and its dreams, and ended with Talley Beatty's streamlined \"Congo Tango Palace,\" a dance whose urgency is as much an effect of its speed as of its buried emotions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930701","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-459693.html","abstract":"  The The Paramount    For stretches of its set on Friday night, the The might almost have been an English blues band.
