There are basic, unresolved questions about the editing of his manuscripts, the chronology of his output, the validity of his recollections. And a more essential mystery shrouds his process of creation. At an Ives-centered festival presented by the Brooklyn Philharmonic last weekend, a member of the audience asked, \"How did you do it?\" The question was directed at the composer John Adams, who had orchestrated several Ives songs, but one wanted to ask it of Ives himself. How, from a chaos of secondhand material, does great music arise?   The weekend's events at the Brooklyn Academy of Music offered many fascinating insights into Ives, although it also created some new confusions. The theme was \"American Transcendentalists,\" tracing the powerful connection between Ives and the school of 19th-century idealist philosophy centered in Concord, Mass. There was a rich spread of Ives works: \"Three Places in New England,\" \"The Unanswered Question,\" various songs and shorter pieces and, naturally, the \"Concord\" Sonata. In and among them, the actor Donald Moffat read aloud selections from Emerson and Thoreau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"The Rise of a Self-Proclaimed Phenomenon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-of-a-self-proclaimed-phenomenon.html","abstract":"  VAMPS AND TRAMPS  By Camille Paglia  532 pages.

His pained, honeyed voice, with its bluesy turns and its countryish ache, fills every line with sincerity; his unhurried, deadpan delivery gives every line the air of an intimate confession. He uses his Large Band, including horns, strings and backup singers, to add small touches of down-home Americana like gospel harmonies or a Western-swing fiddle solo; it's a virtuosic group that always defers to its leader. While Mr. Lovett always comes across as sympathetic and convincing, his songs leave it up to listeners to decide what's really going on. Sometimes his narrators are genuinely affectionate or heartbroken; sometimes they're the weirdos who appear in \"Creeps Like Me.\"    At Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday night, in the first of two shows, Mr. Lovett played a generous, leisurely concert, 2 hours and 40 minutes long. For its first part, he lavished attention on songs that weren't always worth it: material from his latest, and least, album, \"I Love Everybody\" (Curb/MCA). Mr. Lovett is at the highest plateau of his career so far, after building a dedicated following and then extending his name recognition by marrying the actress Julia Roberts. But to make \"I Love Everybody,\" he dipped into his archive of early songs, and many of them are juvenalia: clever and trivial, built on one-liners (\"Penguins are so sensitive to my needs\") or easy ironies. \"Fat Babies,\" Mr. Lovett explained, was written to embarrass anyone who sang along; the audience enthusiastically joined in.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"Decking the Screen With Lots of Savers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/science/peripherals-decking-the-screen-with-lots-of-savers.html","abstract":"  DEAR Santa,    For Christmas I would like a 21-inch SVGA monitor and a one-gigabyte hard disk drive in a Pentium with 32 megs of RAM.

Tournament   The National Collegiate Athletic Association awarded berths yesterday to 32 teams for the Division I tournament, which will start on campuses this week and conclude with the final four Dec. 9-11 at Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.   In keeping with tradition, the N.C.A.A. divided the country into eight regions for the tournament. But it reduced the minimum number of teams in each region from two to one to make room for more at-large berths.   Virginia (17-3-1) is in quest of its fourth consecutive national title and it appears that the Cavaliers are playing their best right now. Seeded second in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament that was staged over three days at Clemson, the Cavaliers captured the tournament with victories over Wake Forest, Duke and Clemson.   North Carolina-Greensboro (17-4-0) will be Virginia's opponent in the first round, which also includes four other teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference, proof that the conference is the strongest in the country.   North Carolina State (13-6-0), Duke (14-6-1), North Carolina (13-6-0) and Maryland (13-5-1) are also in the tournament, whose first round must be completed by Sunday.   St. John's (14-4-3) earned the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Big East tournament by capturing the tournament for the third consecutive year. This time, the Red Storm did it with a 1-0 triumph over Georgetown on a goal by Huey Ferguson with just under five minutes left.   Georgetown (18-3-0) was the regular-season winner in the Big East for the first time and was awarded its first tournament bid. The Hoyas were the most improved team in the league.   \"The league is getting stronger every year,\" said Dave Masur, the coach at St. John's, who took over the Red Storm three years ago and made it into a powerhouse. \"We've had 5 teams ranked in the top 20 in the country.\"   While St. John's will visit Rutgers, Georgetown will play Maryland. Georgetown was ranked 9th and St. John's 10th in the coaches' final regular-season poll, which has the first nine positions unchanged from the previous week.   Rutgers (11-4-3) is in the tournament as a result of winning the Atlantic 10 and then beating Loyola (Md.), the winner of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.   Boston University (18-0-1) finished atop the coaches' national ranking for the end of the regular season as the only undefeated team in the country. The Terriers ended the regular season with a 3-2 triumph over New Hampshire and will meet Harvard.   Harvard (5-8-2) is in the tournament because of the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Ivy League, where Brown finished with an overall record of 11-3-1. The victory over Hartwick earned Brown a bid, and the Bears will play host to New Hampshire (15-4-2) in the first round.   Indiana (19-2-0) was seeded first in the tournament and will play host to Notre Dame (12-9-2). Indiana took the Big Ten tournament with victories over Wisconsin and Penn State, who both made the tournament.   Wisconsin (14-5-0) will play at Southern Methodist (14-3-1), while Penn State (15-5-1) will meet Robert Morris (15-6-1) in a rematch from last year.   San Francisco (9-6-3) is in the tournament for the 26th time thanks to the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the West Coast Conference. The Dons, who have captured the national title four times, the last time in 1980, appeared to be out of it this season, after winning only twice in their first eight games, but they have lost only once in their last 10 games.   San Francisco will play Fresno State (17-2-1), while San Diego (13-5-0) will be at Fullerton State (12-6-2) in another West Coast match.   In other matches around the country, St. Louis (16-5-0) will play Creighton (14-4-1), Alabama-Birmingham (15-3-1) will play U.C.L.A. (15-4-0) and North Carolina-Charlotte (16-3-0) will play host to Charleston (17-6-0). Women's Division I   North Carolina is a step closer to its 12th overall title , and ninth consecutive N.C.A.A. national title. The Tar Heels reached the semifinals again with a 3-1 victory over Duke, the team that ended their undefeated streak at 101 games last month.   Connecticut (19-3-0) will provide the opposition for the Tar Heels (23-1-1) in the semifinals, which will be staged Friday at the University of Portland (Ore.). The Huskies reached the final four with tournament victories over Brown and Hartford.   Notre Dame (21-0-1), the only undefeated team in the country, will play Portland (16-5-0) in the other semifinal to decide Sunday's finalists for the championship.   Notre Dame reached the final four for the first time in its history with victories over George Mason and William and Mary, while Portland advanced by eliminating St. Mary's and Stanford.

The Steelers used a battering defense that harried Bills' quarterback Jim Kelly, who was sacked six times, jarred the ball loose from receivers and rendered Buffalo's offense completely ineffective. - Then, that same defense became a spectacular scoring machine with two great individual plays by cornerback Rod Woodson which resulted in two Steeler touchdowns. It even came up with a blocked field goal when defensive end Brentson Bruckner deflected a 32-yard attempt by Bills kicker Steve Christie with 13 minutes 54 seconds to play.   The result was a 23-10 victory for Pittsburgh (7-3), which remains a game behind Cleveland (8-2) in the American Football Conference's Central Division. The loss dropped the Bills to 5-5 and jeopardized their playoff hopes.   Kelly finished with 22 completions in 43 attempts for 212 yards. He threw one touchdown pass, but was intercepted twice.   Woodson scored on a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter. In the third quarter, he jarred the ball loose from Kelly on a sack for an eight-yard loss. The ball bounced around in the end zone and defensive end Gerald Williams fell on it for a touchdown that helped make it 23-10.   For its part, the Steelers' offense served as nothing more than a distraction until the defense could come back on the field. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Steelers offense had converted just 1 of 11 third-down attempts.   Entering the game, the Bills were in an unfamiliar position of fighting for a playoff berth. The last time they were at .500 this late in the season was in 1987. They are tied with the Jets in the A.F.C. East, two games behind the Dolphins. The Steelers, meanwhile, remain one game behind the first-place Browns (8-2) in the Central.   In the first half the Bills certainly didn't play like the team that had dominated the American Football Conference landscape the last four seasons. Sometimes they resembled that team when they switched out of the two-back set they have deployed in the last few games into their no-huddle attack with three wide receivers -- a staple the last four years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"DANCE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/arts/in-performance-dance-832677.html","abstract":"  Painters and Gertrude Stein Provide the Inspiration  Merce Cunningham Studio    Rachel Thorne Germond choreographically reaffirmed the fun of dancing in \"Splendor Again,\" one of the works she presented on Saturday night.

Unlike four years ago, when Mr. Weicker as Governor-elect was presented a proposed budget with a $1.6 billion revenue shortfall on top of a $562 million deficit for the current year, Mr. Rowland received a two-year budget that was in balance and within the state's legal spending limit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941116","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/16/nyregion/c-corrections-843466.html","abstract":"  A picture yesterday with an article about a gun battle between a heavily armed drifter and the police in San Francisco was published in error.

Audiences have spent too many boring hours listening to the pearly touch of human player pianos; juries have proven themselves better at judging technique and proficiency than insight and musicianship. Competitions are, properly, on the defensive.   So what a pleasure it was on Monday night in Carnegie Hall to hear the gold medalist of the ninth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, and to feel that this was the New York debut of a musician rather than a pianist -- not a fully formed musician, perhaps, but a fascinating musician nonetheless. The Italian pianist Simone Pedroni was 24 when he won the contest in 1993, and is the highest-ranking veteran of the Cliburn wars to play in New York in recent months; Frederic Chiu appeared in the spring, Armen Babakhanyan gave a debut concert a few weeks ago that received critical plaudits, and Fabio Bidini, who played here last February, will give a recital at Tully Hall in December. Mr. Pedroni bested them all in the Van Cliburn Competition, but judging from this performance, he did so without resorting to the typical competition weaponry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941116","headline":"HELMS REQUESTS A DELAY IN VOTE ON TRADE ACCORD","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/16/us/the-new-congress-trade-helms-requests-a-delay-in-vote-on-trade-accord.html","abstract":"  With a threat to disrupt the Administration's foreign policy plans, Senator Jesse Helms urged President Clinton today to delay a Congressional vote on a worldwide trade pact until next year, a move that could unravel the 123-nation agreement.

Or would such a demotion violate his First Amendment rights to free speech?    Professor Jeffries had enjoyed his chairmanship for two decades when, in 1991, he delivered an off-campus speech denouncing \"rich Jews\" as slave traders and conspirators with the Mafia in Hollywood to defame African-Americans.
