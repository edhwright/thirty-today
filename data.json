One prominent example is the fate of the alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who turned his back on more adventurous jazz in the early 1960's. He continues to make recordings that, as he puts it, bought him a house: music deep in the popular blues tradition. But he has suffered at the hands of critics. Mr. Donaldson, who is as fine a be-bop saxophonist as exists, is rarely considered a master.   He is performing with a group that includes Lonnie Smith on organ, Peter Bernstein on guitar and Ben Riley on drums. In two performances last week (on Feb. 1 and 3) Mr. Donaldson made the be-bop language pliable, delivering a small sampling of Charlie Parker's innovations with a soft tone and lyricism. Like Parker, he rarely took more than a few choruses, but a lot happened within those few choruses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940212","headline":"U.S. and Allies Send More Planes for Possible Strikes in Bosnia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/world/conflict-balkans-us-allies-send-more-planes-for-possible-strikes-bosnia.html","abstract":"  British and French aircraft carriers headed for the Adriatic today, and the United States prepared to send more fighter bombers to bases in Italy as NATO formally began the countdown on its demand that Bosnia's Serbs lift their siege of Sarajevo within 10 days, military officials said.

They use short, folkish phrases and subtly strategic harmonies to give songs a sense of tenderness and rising optimism; the turns seem both surprising and inevitable. Such craftsmanship calls for musical expertise and something beyond technique: remembering that the best songs are made to touch listeners, not to impress.   Ivan Lins is one of those songwriters. Mr. Lins, a major star in Brazil who has lately recorded in English, takes after Milton Nascimento both in musical specifics -- a baritone voice that rises to a yearning falsetto, a gift for ballads and a broad palette of local Brazilian rhythms -- and in the general benevolence that radiates from his songs. Like Mr. Nascimento, he concentrates on the music; for two decades, he has worked primarily with the lyricist Victor Martins.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940212","headline":"Russian-Language FM Is Window on 2 Worlds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/world/russian-language-fm-is-window-on-2-worlds.html","abstract":"  Their voices crackle over the airwaves, some timid and creaky with age, others brazenly curious.

With equal parts great ball striking and superb putting, Pavin shot more than 10 strokes lower than the average score of the field (74.55). Given the weather -- temperatures in the 50's, winds gusting to 25 miles an hour -- and the bumpiness of the newly renovated greens, Pavin's round was one of the more remarkable in golf this season. He had nine 3's on his scorecard when only nine players in the field of 145 could break par.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940212","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/style/chronicle-166391.html","abstract":"  IAN SCHRAGER, the hotelier whose name zoomed into public consciousness in the 1970's when he owned Studio 54 with Steve Rubell and who has developed hotels like the Royalton and the Paramount, is about to leap into two new ventures: marriage and fatherhood.

Those stone skeletons -- surrounded by the houses of a modern town that has grown up around them, or standing solitary in a green field with sheep grazing nearby or visible atop a distant hill -- conjure up legends of knights and ladies, saints and outlaws.\n\nThe Anglo-Norman city of Kilkenny, situated on a bend of the River Nore 73 miles southwest of Dublin, is probably the best place in Ireland to get a feeling for life on this island in the Middle Ages. Though no bigger than a large town, Kilkenny, (population 19,000) which dates from the seventh century, has been an important trading and administrative center since at least the 13th century, and was at one time the capital of Ireland. The city retains its medieval street plan, with narrow, winding lanes that rise suddenly and dip sharply. Its streets are lined with substantial Georgian buildings, as well as even older houses that date back to the middle ages -- their chimneys rising from their gable ends, filling the air with the characteristically Irish aroma of turf smoke. In addition to containing several important old buildings, ecclesiastical and secular, Kilkenny provides a base for excursions into the surrounding countryside. Kilkenny is a city for walking. The narrow streets are not easily negotiated by car. On foot you notice more, and you are in a position to appreciate the city's atmosphere and scale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"School Break Activities for Youngsters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/school-break-activities-for-youngsters.html","abstract":"The school vacation week for Westchester's children begins on Feb. 21.

But in jazz, the tendency to tinker, to reshape the past, to make it more modern, is all over the place. It can be heard in the response of early New Orleans bands to the march or in free improvising, where harmony gets thrown out the window. And it can be heard every time a musician makes something new from a precedent -- Charlie Parker plays his version of Lester Young or Buster Smith.   Two recently released box sets, Ornette Coleman's \"Beauty Is a Rare Thing\" and \"The Complete Blue Note 1964-1966 Jackie McLean Sessions,\" find abstraction in full bloom. Both alto saxophonists were running away from the baroque complexities of be-bop, and both landed in different places. Mr. Coleman created a music that not only borrowed from jazz but also from folk, gospel and other black forms and even Mexican music. Mr. McLean, as much as he understood what Mr. Coleman was doing, was a strict product of New York City's intellectual hothouse, where musicians rarely looked outside jazz for influences.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"UP AND COMING: Monique Meunier; First, Star in 'Swan Lake,' Then Be a Psychologist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/up-and-coming-monique-meunier-first-star-in-swan-lake-then-be-a-psychologist.html","abstract":"  BALLETOMANES TALKED OF the wonders of Monique Meunier well before she became a full-fledged member of the New York City Ballet in 1990. She stood out in class, it was said, because of her strong classical technique. She distinguished herself in lead roles in the end-of-the-year \"workshop\" performances presented by the company-affiliated School of American Ballet and in the solos she started to dance in 1992.   Today, though still a member of the corps de ballet, Ms. Meunier is dancing a variety of major roles. \"Commanding,\" \"lucid\" and \"exalted\" are the kinds of adjectives critics use to describe her performances. She seems capable of meeting technical challenges that might throw a much more experienced ballerina.

Newhouse Theater, as having been \"suggested\" by the Arthur Schnitzler classic, \"La Ronde\" (titled \"Reigen\" in German). The young American composer, lyricist and librettist has effectively deconstructed the melancholy and skeptical Viennese sex comedy without putting it back together. The new work is not an adaptation of the Schnitzler play, but it is an impertinent, sometimes haunting, often jokey commentary on it.   \"Hello Again,\" directed and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, is still about the daisy chain of sexual encounters that begins when a whore has al fresco sex with a soldier, who then makes love to a young woman, who moves on to a different young man, until, at last, the ninth and final partner returns to the whore. The Schnitzler play, which is about romantic dreams repeatedly dashed, is contained within the small, hermetically sealed world of turn-of-the-century Vienna. Mr. LaChiusa liberates the Schnitzler characters but at a certain cost to coherence. They now move freely back and forth in time, through the first nine explosive decades of the 20th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"F.Y.I.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/fyi-155438.html","abstract":"  Limits of the Law Q.

Part of Ms. Carey's significance -- and undoubtedly the sharpest controversy around her -- has nothing to do with the singer's musical gifts. Instead it derives from the confusion and discomfort that her multiracial identity provokes in an American culture obsessed with race. Though she has made no secret that she is biracial (her mother is Irish-American, her father is a black Venezuelan), Ms. Carey's candor evokes clashing responses from fans and critics. Some see her statement of mixed heritage as a refusal to bow to public pressure to choose whether she is black or white.

Old Delhi refers to the more ancient, pre-British city to the north of Connaught Circle, while New Delhi is the sprawling, boulevarded part of the city south of Connaught, with the Government buildings, the Parliament, the museums, the Supreme Court and the big old homes built by the British and now occupied by the rich or government bureaucrats.

In 1855, during the Crimean war, the English photographer Roger Fenton took a picture of the Valley of the Shadow of Death after the killing was over and nothing remained but spent cannonballs. During the American Civil War, photographers unable to stop the action recorded bridges, ruins, \"The Scene of General MacPherson's Death\" after the general's body was removed.

A self-taught black painter working in Norwich, Conn., Ruley died violently in 1959, at the age of 77, under suspicious circumstances. Or, as Glenn Robert Smith argues (with the help of Robert Kenner), convincingly if luridly, he was murdered in a racially motivated attack. Married to a white woman and the imperious patriarch of a racially mixed extended family, Ruley took up painting in his later years. His surviving production, presented here in rich color illustrations, comprises small, highly simplified works on board, including pastoral and hunting scenes, landscapes and motifs reworked from photographs in popular magazines. An essay by Stacy Hollander, a curator, and Lee Kogan, a senior research fellow, at the Museum of American Folk Art, traces Ruley's likely sources, primarily stock images of popular heroes and bathing beauties that the artist appropriated to construct a kind of private idyll, a fantasy imagery of male desire with some affinity, as the authors note, to the work of Rousseau. The monographic approach by Mr. Smith, a California collector of folk art, and Mr. Kenner, the former editor of Art & Antiques -- a melodramatic account of Ruley's life and a search for sources and influences -- seems intended primarily to establish a market for Ruley's paintings. The book does not address a range of issues currently being raised in relation to the work of self-taught artists, like the ways race, class and difference shape their work. The book does, however, present interesting new material to be explored in those discussions.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Angel Falls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/travel/l-angel-falls-166740.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Your readers might like to know that it was a news photographer in search of a story who led the first overland expedition to Angel Falls, in May 1949.

I have noticed seals in their habitats during my tens of thousands of miles sailing on my schooner, the Malabar X, along the coasts of Maine, the Atlantic Seaboard and the Pacific Coast, and I can tell you it is rather common knowledge to most seafaring people that seals are the favorite delicacy of sharks. When any seal migrates, its greatest danger comes from the threat of being eaten by a shark.   Due to the incredible overfishing of shark by sports and commercial fishermen the shark population has dwindled substantially since the 30's to the point where shark fishing is barely being allowed. This decimation of the shark population has made it possible for seals to migrate successfully.  While temperature, salinity and food source may have a bearing, the biggest influence on a successful migration is the lack of the major predator.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"State Acquires Stretch of Popular Trout Stream","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/state-acquires-stretch-of-popular-trout-stream.html","abstract":"  New York State has acquired a 14-mile stretch of shoreline on one of the state's premier trout and salmon fishing streams, Oswego County's Salmon River, which flows into Lake Ontario.

WHY: The traditional flat lid -- the one that allows coffee to slosh over the top and onto the drinker's clothing -- may be acceptable for the 50-cent, no-name brew from the corner deli. But not for $2.75 cappuccino or espresso doppio. With their stylish brews, coffees bars have introduced the lids to Manhattan. DOUBLES AS A HAT: The visual effect is startling. The lid looks like a white derby sitting atop the cup. Although there are several variations on the dome lid, all of them let the coffee drinker sip through a small hole in the curved mouthpiece. The lid goes by a variety of names, depending on the manufacturer: Traveler Lid, Sipping Lid, Gourmet Lid. SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE: Manufacturers claim that by raising the roof on the coffee cup, they have advanced the technology of take-out coffee in two ways. First, they talk about \"a splash barrier\" or a \"spill-free drinking environment.\" They say that with an inch of air above the cup, \"coffee doesn't slosh out, doesn't bounce out.\" Second, they say the dome provides space for whipped cream or steamed milk. In other words, they say they have eliminated \"the squish factor.\" WHO MAKES IT: With the growing popularity of both coffee bars and America's takeout life style, competition in the lid business is steaming. Solo Cup Company of Highland Park, Ill., says that it created the genre of the dome lid five years ago and holds a patent on it. Sweetheart Cup Company of Chicago came out with a dome lid a few months ago.   Now, the two are locked in legal combat. Solo has filed a lawsuit, charging patent infringement, against Sweetheart. Molly Powers, Solo's marketing manager, said that no one at Solo could talk about the company's lid, or even provide a sample to be photographed, because of the legal battle. Sweetheart is not reticent. \"The case is frivolous,\" said Daniel M. Carson, the vice president and general counsel of Sweetheart.   Steve Smith, the product manager for hot beverages at Sweetheart, is already claiming a victory. \"Our rate of delivery is better,\" he said. \"When you tip the lid to drink, you don't get too much and you don't get too little.\"   The main difference between the lids lies in the mouthpiece: indented on Solo's, raised on Sweetheart's. COST: Despite the fancy engineering, manufacturers and retailers say the dome lids cost a coffee vendor no more than the flat versions.   Good news, no doubt, for people whose favorite coffee already costs as much as a sandwich.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"FILM CRITICISM\nTHE PHANTOM EMPIRE\nBy Geoffrey O'Brien.\nNorton, $20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"'One Long Orgiastic Read'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/one-long-orgiastic-read.html","abstract":"  THE LITERARY COMPANION TO SEX An Anthology of Prose and Poetry.

St.-Tropez Day Trips  Q. I will be in St.-Tropez, France, for the last week in March and the first week of April and would like to travel on day trips to places like Vence, Nice and Cap-Ferrat. Are there buses from St.-Tropez to these places? -- Susan Wexford, New York, N.Y. A. Bus service from St.-Tropez is very limited, but there are alternatives that will get you where you want to go.   One bus trip that you might not want to miss leaves from La Foux, three miles west of St.-Tropez, at 7:40 A.M. on Saturday, March 26, and proceeds the length of the Riviera to San Remo, Italy. The trip to San Remo, which the tour organizers describe as the flower capital of the Riviera, takes close to three hours and costs $22 round trip without meals, calculated at 5.8 francs to the dollar.   More information: St.-Tropez Tourist Office, Gare Routiere, St.-Tropez; 94.43.26.98.   Only two towns, Toulon and St.-Raphael, are served by buses from the bus station at St.-Tropez. Toulon is west of St.-Tropez, and therefore not in the direction you wish to go.   St.-Raphael, northeast of St.-Tropez, is 1 hour, 25 minutes away by bus. The first departure from the St.-Tropez bus station (94.97.41.21) is at 6:20 A.M. every day; departures after that are more or less hourly until the last bus at 7:15 P.M. The fare is $15.50 round trip.   The good news about St.-Raphael is that it has a railroad station (94.91.50.50) from which trains leave for Nice at frequent intervals, starting at 7:33 A.M. The journey takes about an hour and costs $19 round trip.    Once in Nice, a city with splendid museums and art galleries, you have a couple of options.    The Santa Azur company offers a variety of sightseeing bus tours in and around Nice.

Do you have any updated information about it? -- Harlan D. Everett, Canandaigua, N.Y. A. The original proposal, in the 1980's, called for the 1995 World Expo to be held jointly in Budapest and Vienna. It was to have been the first formal linkage of the two cities since the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918.   In May 1991, however, a referendum was held on the proposal among residents of Vienna and the measure was defeated.   Since then Hungary has decided to go it alone. The Hungarian Parliament voted in December 1991 to hold the event in Budapest in 1996. The exhibition, to be held from May 11 to Oct. 4, will have communications as its main theme.    Some 10 million to 12 million visitors are expected.
