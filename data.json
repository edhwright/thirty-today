This group of paintings from the late 1940's and early 50's highlights a transition for Lewis (1909-1979), when he turned from images of figures to pure abstractions. The works are composed of dense, interlocking planes floating in the center of the canvases, like Cubist compositions, although the more obvious links are to Klee, Feininger and Tobey.

Inside a flickering candlelit pleasure dome, they are plied with wine and meat by aggressive prostitutes who wear bizarre, towering headdresses. Within minutes, the monks have broken most of the 10 prohibitions that were solemnly taught them by a 10-year-old holy man.    Midway in the orgy, General Shi (Wu Hsin-kuo), a warrior who has disguised himself as a monk, is led by his sometime lover Princess Scarlet (Joan Chen) into an inner sanctum with a bathing pool. As they begin to make love, they are joined by drunken monks and prostitutes laughing and thrashing around wildly. The revels are cut short when the child monk reveals that there is a 10,000-tael reward for Shi's arrest and removal to the imperial capital.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Mexico Sets Up a Panel to Respond to Rebels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/world/mexico-sets-up-a-panel-to-respond-to-rebels.html","abstract":"  The Government has formed a multi-party legislative commission to resolve the conflict with rebels in Chiapas and to ease tensions that have reached their highest level.

Yet vastly more plutonium is generated as spent nuclear fuel in civilian power plants. Some of it is being reprocessed for use as fuel for commercial reactors, when in fact low-enriched uranium will do. Plutonium can be used in bombs; its reprocessing needs to be curtailed.    Washington can begin that effort now. It is renegotiating a 1958 agreement with Euratom, the European Union's atomic energy agency, which is due to expire at the end of next year. Under that arrangement, U.S. companies have supplied the Europeans with low-enriched uranium for use in their power plants. Yet Washington has repeatedly waived its own requirements that prohibit the spent fuel generated from that uranium from being reprocessed into plutonium and shipped to others without U.S. approval.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Smith College Makes History In Naming Its Next President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/us/smith-college-makes-history-in-naming-its-next-president.html","abstract":"  Smith College, known as one of the more conservative of the top women's colleges, and as the alma mater of Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, yesterday became the first of the nation's prestigious Northeastern institutions to name a black educator as its president.

If there is no resolution of the strike, Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner said, \"next Thursday or Friday morning at 12:01 A.M., the implementation process will begin.\" The owners' 25-3 vote today gave the executive council, which Selig heads, the authority to declare an impasse and implement the clubs' final offer, the salary cap they proposed Nov. 17.     The decision was contingent on the union's agreement to postpone two deadlines dealing with player contracts. Donald Fehr, the union chief, said from New York he would recommend to the players' executive board that the union agree to the postponements.   Although Selig and John Harrington, chairman of the negotiating committee, emphasized that the owners acted solely in the interest of negotiating an agreement with the players, the decision raised the possibility at least that the owners became concerned that if they had acted today, they would have been declaring an impasse in the talks prematurely.   When the clubs' negotiators left Rye Brook, N.Y., on Wednesday, they were in the middle of perhaps the most promising period of the talks since negotiations began in earnest six months ago.   If the owners had declared an impasse today, they might have strengthened the union's challenge of the move before the National Labor Relations Board. An employer can declare an impasse in talks any time he chooses, but he has to be prepared to defend the action in the face of a union challenge.   The owners initially had scheduled the meeting to act on implementation for Dec. 5, but they emerged from a bargaining session in Leesburg, Va., on Nov. 30 and announced they had agreed to postpone the meeting for 10 days to give negotiations additional time to work. At the time, it appeared they had acted at the urging of Bill Usery Jr., the mediator.   But some management people since have suggested that the owners themselves wanted to delay the meeting and the vote.   Although Usery said last week that implementation would be \"very, very unfortunate,\" Harrington said today that the mediator had not asked the owners to delay their vote again.   \"He just asked us not to do anything or say anything that would preclude continuing collective bargaining in the spirit we had conducted collective bargaining,\" Harrington said at a news conference at the O'Hare Hilton. \"I think he will be surprised at this move.\"   Selig did not identify the three clubs that voted no. However, Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles was on record as saying he would oppose implementation, and the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers or the New York Mets were believed to be the other two clubs with negative votes.   Obviously, the overwhelming majority of owners are eager to implement the salary cap if the two sides are unable to reach agreement on a new collective bargaining contract. But they also don't want to put themselves at risk legally.   Taking the positive approach, Selig said: \"If there's a scintilla of a chance to have a meaningful solution at the table, you've got to try it. If you fail, you try again.\"   Fehr said it was positive that the owners were willing to continue negotiations without a salary cap in place. But he added, \"I can't tell you what it will lead to.\"   He said the union would hold internal meetings this weekend, then be prepared to resume negotiations on Monday. The talks, he said, could be held in Washington, Usery's home turf.   Reacting to Harrington's characterization of the owners' move as an olive branch, Fehr said, \"I hope it turns out to be one.\"   As to what might have happened to change the atmosphere, he said: \"There were some discussions that seemed to be of a more constructive tone. And I think everybody agrees on that.\"   Talks had been stalled on the union's refusal to accept a salary cap or a luxury tax on payrolls that could act like a cap. The owners removed their latest tax proposal, the one they made last Sunday in reply to a players' proposal 24 hours earlier, from the table Tuesday in Rye Brook.   \"We're back to a salary cap,\" they told union negotiators.   But during a bargaining session late Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, the clubs' representatives, for the first time, indicated that they might have some flexibility on the way they would tax payrolls.    That idea caught the players' attention, and the two sides returned to the table Wednesday afternoon in a more hopeful manner. But while the union offered seemingly conciliatory ideas on elements of the owners' revenue-sharing plan that is linked to a salary cap, it did not produce a proposal the owners' negotiators said they expected and were waiting for.   The management team ended the talks at that point and flew here for today's meeting.   \"On the way in,\" Harrington related, \"we reviewed all the alternatives that were available to us. We met again this morning at 9 o'clock. The committee concluded on a unanimous basis to make the recommendation we made to the full ownership. It was done in the spirit of opening one more window of opportunity.\"   Harrington said the owners' willingness \"to walk through those doors of deadlines and open them again should show we're dead-set to negotiate a resolution of this dispute.\"   The two deadlines in question deal with clubs' salary arbitration offers to retain rights to their free agents plus the players' responses and the tendering of contracts to unsigned players on clubs' 40-man rosters.   The arbitration offer deadline was Dec. 7 and the response deadline on Monday. On Nov. 30, those were pushed back to Dec. 17 and 23. Clubs must tender contracts to unsigned players by Dec. 20. The new deadline for and tenders is Dec. 23. The deadline for players response to arbitration offers most likely will be Jan. 4. But the arbitration offers will become immaterial if the clubs implement a salary cap.   In all of his talk about the clubs' fervent desire to negotiate a new system rather than implementing one, Selig sounded one ominous note.   \"If the union really wants to reach an agreement,\" Selig said, \"we're going to give it more time, but it must address our central issue -- establishing a relationship between revenues and salaries.\"   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Shopping and Weather:The Holiday Mood on City Streets : Hong Kong","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/style/IHT-shopping-and-weatherthe-holiday-mood-on-city-streets-hong-kong.html","abstract":"Christmas is tough for taitais - which means Mrs. in Mandarin but in its common use refers to women who already have time to shop every day of the year.

In \"Growing Up With Jean-Pierre Leaud, Nouvelle Vague's Wild Child,\" a 14-film series beginning today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, a new generation of filmgoers will be able to discover afresh this most tantalizingly transparent of actors in his cinematic journey from the wild child of Truffaut to the father of a wild child in Olivier Assayas's \"Paris at Dawn.\" And those of us who, in the context of 1960's and 70's film culture, saw the actor more as an extension of different auteurs than a person in his own right, can now assess what distinguishes Mr. Godard's Leaud from Truffaut's Antoine Doinel, and how both are modified and expanded by Mr. Skolimowski and Eustache, and later by such heirs of the New Wave as Philippe Garrel, Mr. Assayas and Aki Kaurismaki.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Jockeys and Track Group To Meet on Insurance Pact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/sports/jockeys-and-track-group-to-meet-on-insurance-pact.html","abstract":"Amid signs that the two sides are moving closer to a resolution, representatives of the Jockeys' Guild and the Thoroughbred Racing Associations will meet in Manhattan today in an attempt to complete a new contract regarding insurance for the riders.\n\nThe current contract expires at midnight on Dec. 31.

Reggae has long since supplanted it as the rhythm and rhyme of choice. But what Ernie Els is doing at the Tryall Club up on the hill over the Caribbean is calling to mind an old calypso song and dance called \"The Limbo,\" a party tune where revelers bend backward and try to slink under a crossbar while the band sings, \"How low can you go?\"   In Els's case, the answer seems to be: as low as he wants. For the second straight day in the Johnnie Walker World Championship, he tore Tryall apart, shooting another round of 64 that was, if anything, more effortless than the one he opened with on Thursday. On a warm tropical day, Els turned up the heat a notch, increasing his lead to six strokes over Nick Faldo, who shot his second straight 67 only to lose ground, and Tom Lehman, who shot 65.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941217","headline":"Celtics Are Reportedly Seeking to Buy The Red Sox","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/sports/basketball-celtics-are-reportedly-seeking-to-buy-the-red-sox.html","abstract":"  Despite a losing record on the basketball court, the limited partnership that runs the Boston Celtics has lately been winning big on the balance sheet and, according to people in the partnership, is interested in buying the Boston Red Sox.

This week I have also walked in those paths, sampling a few of the many performances this work ritually receives every December, marveling again at the unearthly simplicity of \"Behold, I tell you a mystery,\" the tenderness of \"He was despised and rejected,\" and the robust vigor of Handel's conception of God and man. This oratorio has an uncanny ability to survive almost any performance, shedding glory on the players even if they do not always return the favor, allowing itself to be freely molded in the image of the musical worshiper.   Those images once included gargantuan performances like the one in London with 3,500 choristers that George Bernard Shaw wrote about in 1891. That tradition, a reflection of the British empire at the height of its power, is much more modestly preserved in the New York performances of the Oratorio Society or the Masterwork Chorus, but Handel today is generally far less grandiose and less awesome. There is a presumption of familiarity in the performances. The forces are usually smaller, informed by the authenticity movement; the singing is less stentorian and less connected to operatic styles. Trumpets sound, good tidings are told and the Lord reign eth without the music's seeming to come from some realm beyond the earthly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941217","headline":"Johnson Staying in TV","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/sports/sports-people-football-johnson-staying-in-tv.html","abstract":"  JIMMY JOHNSON plans to announce that he has decided to stay in television, but may return to coaching after a three-year network contract expires, The Dallas Morning News reported yesterday.

At issue was a 1995 restriction that each syndicate can build only two new yachts. But a majority of challengers, as well as the United States' three defense groups, alleged collusion between Bertrand's group and a syndicate founded by SYD FISCHER of Australia. They charged that Bertrand was using Fischer's new cup yacht to further One Australia's two-boat program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"To Solve Tipping Problem, Simply Do Away With It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/nyregion/l-to-solve-tipping-problem-simply-do-away-with-it-148687.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Those who defend the concept of tipping -- in your Dec. 4 article, \"A Time to Give, to Everybody\" -- argue that without tips, service people do not get paid enough.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"Deals & Discounts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/travel/travel-advisory-deals-discounts.html","abstract":"  HAWAII PACKAGES Outrigger Hotels Hawaii has introduced a Hawaiian Escape package for the month of January at its Waikiki hotels.

Patricia Field, the Greenwich Village emporium that specializes in club clothes, has been selling the 1620 jacket ($120) since last fall. \"It was the kids who discovered it and inspired us to buy it,\" said Annex Song, the manager of the store at 10 East Eighth Street. \"It wasn't something a company came up with to market to them.\" LIFELINE: The 1620 was conceived four years ago by I. Spiewak & Sons, a 90-year-old New York City uniform manufacturer that supplies clothes for police officers, airline mechanics and toll collectors, among others. The company spent two years developing and testing the jacket so that it would meet National Fire Protection Association standards. YOU BET YOUR LIFE: The jacket is designed to protect against blood-borne pathogens, which provides peace of mind to emergency health-care workers in the age of AIDS. AS SEEN IN SOHO: Phat Farm, on Prince Street, has the Spiewak coat (in blue or red) with the Phat Farm \"All City\" logo embroidered over the breast pocket; it costs $150. At the Anna Sui boutique on Greene Street, there is a black nylon coat with reflective tape that mimics the Spiewak version; it costs $415 (but was on sale last week for $335.) AS SEEN IN MILAN: The Spiewak coat has an upscale cousin: the ultra-chic, rather expensive industrial-strength nylon coat from Prada, the 81-year-old Italian leather-goods house. AS SEEN IN NEW JERSEY: When Katzins Uniform in Newark put the 1620 in its window, the hip-hop crowd, which was already buying coveralls and Carhartt parkas from the store, started making inquiries. \"It just proves that style knows no bounds,\" said Len Schlosberg, an owner, who is also the chairman of the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors. Katzins sells the 1620 for $181. (For an additional cost, the parka can be accessorized with matching protective pants and Hollofil or Thinsulate liners.) POETIC JUSTICE: At first, the 1620 seems like more protection than anyone but an Emergency Medical Service worker would need. But, alas, when one considers the dangers of city life today, it makes sense that a jacket designed for bloody medical emergencies would become a contemporary fashion statement.

Jade Palace, the county's newest Chinese restaurant, proves that statement. \n\nAlmost every dish we sampled was excellent, but since the restaurant was barely half full, we have withheld a higher rating until present standards can be maintained with a full house. \n\nForget grease and heavy sauces. Cantonese cooking is light and operates on the principle that the character of the ingredients should not be altered and each element should enhance every other one. Thus simple cooking methods are employed.\n\nBecause pure flavors are highly valued, freshness and variety are essential. And both are available in the abundance of fish and shellfish, tea, rice, peanuts, meats, poultry, vegetables and fruits resulting from the district's semitropical climate, fertile valleys and proximity to the South China Sea. \n\nThe menu is deceptively simple. The high quality of ingredients and their skillful preparation make dishes unusually delicious. Posted on the wall, a small menu of daily specials is written in Chinese, a practice common in Chinese restaurants. Owners want to please all their customers and fear that non-Chinese diners might dislike any unusual or unfamiliar tastes and take their patronage elsewhere. Those interested in a bit of experimentation or in simply what's up for the day should ask David Ng, the affable owner, for suggestions. \n\nSoups here are impressive, and just right for chilling winter days. The two we tried were superb: tender morsels of beef with parsley and egg white in one case and chunky dried scallops, squid and shrimp with shreds of yellow leek. Bring a friend, as these interesting soups are made for two.\n\nNor was seafood disappointing. With its fine texture and delicate flavor, steamed grass carp proved the ultimate in carp. When it's available, steamed flounder should also be considered. Tender squid starred in two delectable dishes: with fresh, homemade pickled mustard greens (light years from the often chokingly sour canned variety) and with a skim of breading in salt-and-pepper squid.\n\nPerfectly sauteed lobster (in the shell) with ginger and scallions was a fine version of a widely available dish, and succulent shrimps with hearts of cabbage were just as carefully handled. As good as Manhattan Chinatown's best, conch with anchovy sauce was paired with bean curd stuffed with minced shrimp. \n\nExceptionally light E-fu noodles, a Cantonese specialty, are often served at the end of a banquet. They made a satisfying addition to humbler meals. These delicious noodles are first fried, then dried and finally boiled and tossed with a vegetable or two, ours being sliced black mushrooms and safflower stalks.\n\nBeef-lovers will enjoy marinated short ribs, a tad peppery and succulent to the bone, and juicy cuts of beef with broccoli and loads of fragrant fresh ginger.

This is pertinent because one of the items Santa should be distributing this season is THE HISTORICAL ATLAS OF NEW YORK CITY: A Visual Celebration of Nearly 400 Years of New York City's History (Holt, $45). The book, by Eric Homberger, who teaches American studies at the University of East Anglia in England, may be as close to a printed CD-ROM as paper can get; it is a triumph of graphics, with text, maps and photographs sharing space in a variety of colors, typefaces and layouts. These brilliant displays are built around Mr. Homberger's history of the city from precolonial days to the current 42d Street renewal. It is a fair and lucid commentary that includes a plethora of relevant and not-so-relevant but descriptive detail. Although other boroughs are mentioned and mapped, this is essentially a Manhattan book, and no less interesting for that. Alice Hudson, chief of the New York Public Library's Map Division, has presided over a magnificent assortment of maps that, with other charts and graphs, tells the reader about the bewildering demographics of the city. The material, which might otherwise seem too academic, comes to life in these clear-cut, simplified expositions. Most useful is the chronology that wraps up the city's history -- a hodgepodge of notable incident and era-dividing development. The spread of material across the pages may seem difficult to assimilate all at once, but you do not need to -- it is a book that lends itself remarkably well to dip-and-flip reading. RICHARD F.

Or maybe it was when Reeves coached John Elway, who has pulled off a few last-minute victories for the Broncos in his time.   There is no question that it is the player who does the work in those final minutes. Staubach and Elway were the ones throwing the passes and running the offense, not Reeves.

While leading actresses languish or play thankless roles, men continue to tough it out in the most competitive of all movie awards categories: best supporting actor.   This year turned out to be a particularly brutal one for supporting actor candidates and once again we see why these secondary roles boast a disproportionate share of talent. For one thing, good supporting roles are easier to write than leading ones, because they needn't be fully rounded or carry a story.

The archipelago is made up of five islands, one so small it registers on few maps.

In fact, so all-powerful are the forces of love, family and benign mischievousness -- and so unimportant are factors like income and upbringing -- that a Jewish working girl from Flushing with tight skirts, huge hair and a 100-octane accent can easily get a job as a surrogate parent for a family of up-tight Manhattan-dwelling bluebloods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"Ms. Aboyoun, Mr. LoFrumento","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/style/weddings-ms-aboyoun-mr-lofrumento.html","abstract":"  Susan Jane Aboyoun, an associate at the New York law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, was married yesterday to Anthony LoFrumento, a vice president of strategic planning at Chemical Bank in New York.

He was poor and ambitious and he was quickly out peddling milk. Ten years later he was running his own dairy and had six children, all of whom he urged to do one thing: take absolute advantage of education and pursue it with a vengeance. Opportunity would follow. \n\nThey did. Bill Graustein's father, Archibald, became a lawyer and investor and philanthropist. One uncle became a professor of mathematics at Harvard, another an engineer; two of his aunts were among the first women to receive Ph.D's in natural sciences from Harvard and another aunt became a state senator in New Hampshire.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"Across the River With Bright Lights","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/nyregion/across-the-river-with-bright-lights.html","abstract":"BASH THEATRICAL LIGHTING is based here, but it really shines on Broadway.\n\n Bash, a 30-year-old company, rents lighting equipment to many shows on Broadway -- including \"Sunset Boulevard,\" \"Grease\" and \"Blood Brothers\" -- as well as to extravaganzas like \"Barney's TV Special,\" Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Miss America Pageant, the Gay games, the N.B.A. All-Star Game and virtually all the nightclub acts in Las Vegas, Nev.\n\n Yet despite a stellar client list, the appearance of Bash's modest headquarters gives no hint of show business glamour. A driver heading for the company's 55,000-square-foot building, in a small industrial complex off busy Dell Street, must carefully navigate a rutted parking lot dotted with delivery trucks.\n\n But the clients in luxury cars and the copies of Variety and Entertainment Weekly in the waiting room tell the story.\n\n \"I don't want to show off,\" Don Stern, an owner of the company, said of the simple surroundings. \"We have a lot of room here, New York City is 12 minutes away, and it's in this location we have to be.\"\n\n Mr. Stern and six of his top employees wear beepers 24 hours a day to handle emergencies.\n\n \"Last night, I'm sitting home, and one of my customers beeps me and says, 'Donny, get some guys down to the Garden; we're having trouble with certain spots,\"' Mr. Stern said during a recent interview. \"There's never a day that goes by without an emergency phone call, and I'm right there to respond to it. This is what I thrive on.\"\n\n Bash, which buys its equipment from hundreds of manufacturers and has branches in Orlando, Fla., Baltimore, and Las Vegas, is one of three top theatrical lighting companies in the country that compete for stage productions, political conventions, music videos and other television production work, Mr. Stern said. In the New York region, he has competitors in Westchester County and Long Island, he said.\n\n Contracts are awarded by bids, ranging from lavish New York productions like \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"A Christmas Carol,\" to a high school show. While noting that Broadway shows often budget 15 percent of their start-up costs for lighting, Mr. Stern said that even though most of his profit comes from such extravaganzas, it is important not to ignore the small jobs, because the youngster who rents one light may someday be the biggest lighting designer in the country.\n\n In competing for business, Mr. Stern said, \"Believe me, we're walking a tightrope\" among managers, who want to get the job done inexpensively; lighting designers, who want creativity but at a low price, and a show's stage electricians who look for equipment that is easy to operate.\n\n After a contract is awarded, the company is sent a blueprint with the total amount of equipment, like lamps, cable, dimmers and control consoles that will be needed. After Bash cleans and focuses the equipment and sometimes designs special effects, the show sends its own electricians to label each part for positioning in the theater.\n\n Bash's building houses thousands of lights and miles of cable, said Mr. Stern, noting that today's productions use about five times as much equipment as was needed 30 years ago, and it is much more sophisticated. Now, a three-foot computer board can operate hundreds of lights all over the theater.\n\n Despite the sophistication of today's equipment, the company's tasks require flexibility, too, Mr. Stern said. \"You have to be prepared to change at a moment's notice,\" he said, recalling the time that his company had set up lights for a news conference by President Ronald Reagan. But the President \"came down another way,\" had the equipment had to be moved hastily.\n\n \"And you'd better have a backup generator standing by if the lights go down or if the place isn't equipped for enough power,\" Mr. Stern said. \"You might be doing an outdoor pageant like the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the promoters want to know why you have to have all these units. Well, suppose it starts to rain, then what?\"\n\n Mr. Stern, who is 55, has been running Bash for 19 years. He has a partner, Bobby Cannon, who manages operations. Mr. Stern says he sleeps no more than three hours a night and gets to the office by 6:30 every morning and stays late. He manages to squeeze in racquetball three nights a week, he said, and spends some weekends showing off his four vintage 1957 to 1959 Chevys in local car shows.\n\n Mr. Stern has a background as a stage electrician.\n\n \"I was just starting college, majoring in accounting, when my father died,\" he said. \"He had been a stagehand, and my mother called the union and got me work as a journeyman electrician. I got $35 on my first day, which was a lot back then. It was a Burt Reynolds movie, and I remember him breaking something on his body that day while doing a stunt.\"\n\n Mr. Stern promptly quit college and began a career backstage. Work was exciting, he said, and he got to travel all over the country. Every day brought something different, but eventually, working days, nights and holidays took a toll.\n\n \"In 1975, I bought into Bash as a partner,\" Mr. Stern said. \"The original guys were ready to get out, and I wanted to settle down. After I was here, though, I found that a lot of inventory I thought I had in stock was just empty boxes. I went to everyone I knew to try to get business from them. I told them: 'I want an opportunity. Give me a shot.\"'\n\n His perseverance paid off. Bash was hired to illuminate three Broadway shows, including \"Oh! Calcutta!\" The assignments took almost all the company's inventory, 600 lights. Yet that initial venture as almost the end of Bash lighting.\n\n \"I'd severely underpriced the shows, now we had no products to rent out to anyone else, there was very little revenue, coming in, and I felt so bad I didn't sleep for three weeks,\" Mr. Stern said. \"It's not very nice to hope and pray that a show closes, but that's what I had to do. Luckily, two of them did. What a lesson to learn.\"\n\n After that, Mr. Stern said, the company began to do well, growing 20 to 30 percent a year ever since. Bash employs a staff of 65 and will soon open a new branch in Chicago. But, Mr. Stern said, he will never depend entirely on the company's reputation in the industry.\n\n \"My peers are on a top level, but the wheel keeps turning,\" he said. \"We have seminars here for designers and their young assistants and college kids from Bergen Community College and Montclair State College who want to learn about the business. We show them as much as they want, so we can make a difference with the next generation who will be running backstages. They say, 'Donny, how can I make this work?,' and I'm happy to tell them all I know.\"\n\n Mr. Stern says he is not stagestruck at all, although he goes to all the openings.\n\n \"I look to see how a show is lit,\" Mr. Stern said. \"In 'Sunset Boulvevard,' there is the two spin, giving the impression of a ripple effect in the water scene. That's what turns me on. I'm a gimmick man.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"Beloved Cartoon Characters Star in Two Shows","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/nyregion/art-beloved-cartoon-characters-star-in-two-shows.html","abstract":"  THE playful ring to Walt Disney's name, plus his chubby signature with a circle over the i instead of a dot, seems of a piece with his accomplishment.

At least, that is the impression conveyed by \"Vladimir Tytla: Master Animator,\" one of the two cartoon shows now at the Katonah Museum of Art here. As the guest curator, John Canemaker, relates in the catalogue, Tytla's mother was born in Poland, the daughter of an architect with aristocratic pretensions; his father, a Galician, served in the Austro-Hungarian cavalry. The two immigrated to the United States because their families, practicing different forms of Catholicism, were opposed to the match.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941218","headline":"OUTDOORS;\nDiscoveries Around the Bend From a Not-So-Secret Hole","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/sports/outdoors-discoveries-around-the-bend-from-a-notsosecret-hole.html","abstract":"Although we arrived at the pullout above one of our favorite pools on the Salmon River well before the naked boughs of the hardwoods were visible against the sky, we apparently didn't get there early enough.
