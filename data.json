Except for the loss to George Mason in the 1985 championship game, North Carolina has captured the title every year since the N.C.A.A. instituted the women's tournament in 1982. After a fairly close game before intermission, the Tar Heels erupted for four goals in the second half to hand Notre Dame (22-1-1) its only loss of the season. The Tar Heels finished at 25-1-1, with their only loss coming against Duke and their tie against Notre Dame earlier in the season. MEN'S SOCCER  Two Upsets as N.C.A.A. Play Starts  Two big upsets marked the first round of the N.C.A.A. Division I men's tournament yesterday. North Carolina defeated host South Carolina, last year's runner-up, 1-0, on a goal by Mark Jonas in the 17th minute and fourth-seeded North Carolina-Charlotte suffered a 1-0 overtime loss to the College of Charleston. Virginia, the defending by beat North Carolina-Greensboro, 3-0.

The run pulled the Lady Vols (1-0) ahead, 45-32. They built the cushion to 60-43 before the Lady Techsters took advantage of 5 turnovers to score 11 straight points and cut the lead to 60-54 with 47 seconds left. Debra Williams, who finished with 23 points, had 5 during that run. Louisiana Tech was forced to foul at that point, and point guard Michelle Marciniak hit 4 straight free throws to put Tennessee out of reach, 68-59, with 30 seconds left. (AP) FIELD HOCKEY  James Madison Triumphs in Overtime  Gwen Stoltzfus's shot in overtime clinched James Madison's 2-1 victory over top-ranked North Carolina for the N.C.A.A. field hockey championship yesterday in Brookline, Mass. After two scoreless 15-minute overtimes, Stoltzfus clinched James Madison's first crown in the stroke-off when she beat North Carolina goalkeeper Jana Withrow with a hard, low shot. The Dukes (20-3-1) won the shootout, 4-2. No. 1 North Carolina finished 21-2.

After settling into fourth place early in yesterday's mile-and-an-eighth race, Tabasco Cat, the 2-1 favorite with Pat Day aboard, found room to rally along the rail at the top of the stretch, but he had no punch and dropped back. River Flyer, ridden by Chris Antley, won his fourth straight race on the turf in 1:472/5 and paid $10 for $2 to win. Dare and Go took second. GOLF  3 Weeks, 3 Championships for Ozaki  Jumbo Ozaki birdied the final hole yesterday for his third victory in three weeks, a one-shot triumph over Tom Watson in the Dunlop Phoenix event in Miyazaki, Japan. The 47-year-old Ozaki came from behind with a seven-under-par 65, finishing at 15-under 201 in the tournament, which was shortened to 54 holes because of rain. Watson missed three birdie putts in a row from less than 8 feet on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes and left a tying 25-foot eagle putt on the last hole 2 feet short.

foul trouble to beat No. 11 Indiana, 77-72, in the opening round of the Maui Invitational in Lahaina, Hawaii. The game, the season opener for both teams, was intense, and Utah's depth helped quite a bit. Jessie, a junior college transfer, made both ends of a 1-and-1 with 19 seconds left for a 75-70 lead. Indiana freshman Michael Hermon scored on a rebound with 10 seconds left to again make it a three-point game. Sophomore Keith Van Horn, the Utes' leading scorer and rebounder last season who was saddled with foul trouble throughout, made both ends of a 1-and-1 with 9 seconds left. A 3-pointer by Hermon bounced long off the rim and the Utah players jumped in a celebration circle near midcourt as a fan ran around the court with a school flag. Utah will play No. 7 Maryland, which beat Chaminade, 95-67, in tonight's semifinals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941122","headline":"Banned Unit Of Lockheed May Get Pact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/22/nyregion/banned-unit-of-lockheed-may-get-pact.html","abstract":"  A data-processing company that was barred from seeking New York City contracts because of its role in the corruption scandals of the 1980's has been selected by transit officials to receive a $17 million contract from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

One reason, he says, is that the accord will threaten American sovereignty. That at least sounds noble, though Mr. Dole is wrong. His other reason is narrow and crass. As he told ABC on Sunday, he may block the trade accord unless the Administration swallows a cut in the tax on capital gains -- the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments.   Mr. Dole's behavior mirrors what the electorate decisively rejected two weeks ago: politicians who say they stand for one set of principles but act according to another. The Republican Party has proudly put the U.S. in the forefront of nations negotiating for open trade and investment. Mr. Dole supported past free-trade pacts because he recognized that they contributed mightily to world growth. The new accord would give the U.S. economy alone a boost of between $70 billion and $200 billion a year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941122","headline":"COLLEGE SOCCER REPORT","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/22/sports/college-soccer-report-892351.html","abstract":"  N.C.A.A.

Exploiting the extraordinary efficiency and speed of biological reactions, he translated a difficult mathematical problem into the language of molecular biology and solved it by carrying out a reaction in one-fiftieth of a teaspoon of solution in a test tube.   Conventional computers perform operations on logical symbols, which are represented inside the machine by the flow of electrons. Dr. Adleman's idea is to set up a system of symbols whose tangible expression is not electrons but the chemical units of DNA. The idea is not so far fetched given that DNA is a rich repository of information and that living cells are processing the information all the time. In Dr. Adleman's test tube system, he sets up a problem by synthesizing particular molecules of DNA, and he processes the information through the chemical reactions that take place when the molecules are mixed together.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941122","headline":"Pulling Punches; NATO Hits Serbs, But Not Too Hard","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/22/world/pulling-punches-nato-hits-serbs-but-not-too-hard.html","abstract":"  By military standards, the NATO attack carried out today against a Serbian-controlled air base in Croatia was the equivalent of a nasty note.

But the recent election triumphs of the Republican right have re-energized crusades and catch phrases -- \"family values\" is one -- that have traditionally been used against homosexuals. Will gay men and women be forced to step back, even if only part way, into the closet? The question at the moment is this: Is the door half open or half closed?    The answer, at least as far as television entertainment is concerned, is that the door has never been open wider. And it is likely to stay that way. A few years ago, gay groups were complaining, justifiably, that they were tired of seeing homosexuality portrayed on television as a problem. They wanted to see themselves integrated into ordinary situations. They wanted to be depicted as being as demographically diverse as heterosexuals. A survey of recent programs confirms considerable changes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941123","headline":"Glimpsing Promise In the Human Voice As an Instrument In the Future of Jazz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/23/arts/glimpsing-promise-in-the-human-voice-as-an-instrument-in-the-future-of-jazz.html","abstract":"  In the early 1980's, when the rank and file of young jazz musicians started a pilgrimage to New York, one instrument was conspicuous by its absence: the voice. In the last decade, one important singer has emerged, Cassandra Wilson, and a few others of less than historic ability are hanging around. Jazz singing seems to have entered a long, deep winter.   Tonight's vocal competition at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here, held in front of a sold-out audience by the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, was supposed to warm the climate for singers. The institute, founded by the Monk family and Maria Fisher, a philanthropist who also started the Beethoven Society of America, has been holding jazz's equivalent of the Van Cliburn Competition for eight years. It has become one of jazz's institutional powerhouses, a marketing machine that has virtually guaranteed careers for its winners, who include the saxophonist Joshua Redmon and the pianists Marcus Roberts, Jacky Terrasson and Joey DeFrancesco. It provides a souk where the major labels have been able to do their shopping, a Wal-Mart for an industry notoriously short on scouting ability.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941123","headline":"A Lawyer Who Spoke Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/23/opinion/a-lawyer-who-spoke-up.html","abstract":"  The privilege against compelled self-incrimination, said the dean of Harvard Law School, is \"one of the great landmarks in man's long struggle to make himself civilized.\" Forty years ago, when Erwin Griswold spoke out in that manner, not many were willing to defend the Bill of Rights against Senator Joseph McCarthy, who railed against what he called \"Fifth-Amendment Communists\" -- traitors, he charged, hiding behind their rights.

But he warned that the most recent cut could not be totally absorbed through administrative staff reductions, and that eliminating \"two teachers per school\" might be necessary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941123","headline":"Film in Review; Black Action With Jokes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/23/movies/film-in-review-black-action-with-jokes.html","abstract":"L.A. ex-cop helps D.E.A. agent on case like one that ended his career.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941123","headline":"Jones Quits as Coach At Oklahoma State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/23/sports/sports-people-college-football-jones-quits-as-coach-at-oklahoma-state.html","abstract":"  PAT JONES resigned as Oklahoma State's football coach yesterday to let someone else guide a program still trying to recover from National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions leveled five and a half years ago.
