Her postings on the computer bulletin board America Online were repeated word for word in magazines; her arrests, scandals and the drug overdose of the bassist in her band, Hole, made national headlines.

Or, rather, it is a show of old stuff, fairly new stuff, valuable stuff and stuff to which no one in his right mind would give house room. Fortunately for the dealers, however, quite a few of the customers are not in their right minds. Among them I count myself, who last year bought a decal'd pink tin cake carrier, circa 1937, in the event I have to carry a cake someplace. My companions said I shouldn't pass it up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"Briefcase : Guinness Flight Launches Convervative Mixed Fund","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/your-money/IHT-briefcase-guinness-flight-launches-convervative-mixed-fund.html","abstract":"Guinness Flight Global Asset Management Limited is launching a new fund with a \"conservatively managed portfolio of cash, bonds and equities.\".The initial portfolio will be 45 percent invested in equities with 35 percent in bonds and the balan","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"After Vigil for Verdict, A Plea for Gun Control","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/nyregion/after-vigil-for-verdict-a-plea-for-gun-control.html","abstract":"  In an extraordinary courthouse press conference minutes after Colin Ferguson was convicted in the Long Island Rail Road shooting spree, survivors and relatives of those who died used their moments before the cameras to plead for stricter gun control, rather than to condemn Mr. Ferguson.    \"The manufacturers, the gun people look for the almighty dollar,\" Robert Giugliano said, his voice rising. \"Enough is enough.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"Met Camp Attractive To Players In Need","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/sports/baseball-met-camp-attractive-to-players-in-need.html","abstract":"  There was the principle, and then there was the money.

Concussions are here today, but not necessarily gone tomorrow, which is why Aikman and six other pro quarterbacks convened here today for the most squeamish of seminars.    A panel of doctors was granted an audience this afternoon with Dallas's Aikman, San Francisco's Steve Young and Minnesota's Warren Moon -- to name three -- and, at day's end, there was a recommendation to make concussions a leaguewide headache. Leigh Steinberg, who brainstormed the convention and is the agent for all of the quarterbacks, will submit a proposal to the National Football League's competition committee, and, at the least, he hopes quarterbacks of the future will be treated like punters: gingerly.    Steinberg and his panel of neurologists -- doing much wishful thinking -- will also call for the elimination of artificial turf, a re-evaluation of helmet wear and the inclusion of a sideline medical referee, whose sole job would be to rule on a player's ability to play.    Aikman could easily be the concussion poster boy. He has suffered six in his six-season career, and he can barely recount his most recent Super Bowl. He still wears linebacker Wilber Marshall's fingerprints under his chin -- or helmet prints, to be exact -- and league officials confirmed today there could be rule changes coming that keep quarterbacks upright.    \"How can they possibly help?\" asked Young, the league's reigning most valuable player. \"They're going to make a lineman yell before he hits you?\"    According to the league executive Joe Browne, it is conceivable that the league -- at the behest of its subcommittee on concussions -- will expand a quarterback's safety net next season. Under current rules, pass rushers cannot overtly maim a signal caller in the pass pocket, but can club him outside of that realm. That's exactly why Marshall, the Arizona linebacker, was not penalized or fined after he blasted Aikman last season -- because Aikman had roamed from the so-called pocket -- but that rule might be amended at the league meetings in March.    \"It was pretty intense,\" Aikman said today, recalling Marshall's gruesome, helmet-first assault. \"I don't know if I've recovered yet from that thing.\"    Post-concussion syndrome was a large topic of discussion today, and doctors on the panel tried to clear up several myths. First, team trainers -- when determining the severity of the blow -- should not ask the player if he can remember the score or what he ate for breakfast. It is more helpful, they said, to examine his ability to concentrate by asking him to recite the months of the year backward. If a player conquers that question and then shows no amnesia in the next 20 minutes, he should be allowed to re-enter the game.    The doctors also warned that many quarterbacks can play deftly despite their concussions -- but may not remember one single touchdown pass. This, in fact, is what happened to Aikman in the playoffs of January 1994. He suffered a concussion in the conference championship against San Francisco and still did not have his complete equilibrium for the ensuing Super Bowl against Buffalo.    \"I said at the time had it been a regular season game, I probably wouldn't have played,\" Aikman said today. \"I was having headaches that week. But, for me, it's the Super Bowl. I know you're saying, 'You're an idiot, a moron for playing.' But, to me, it doesn't matter.    \"I remember playing the game, but not much more. My first Super Bowl, I remember everything that took place at the Rose Bowl, and, to this day, everything's clear.

George Pataki says he is looking for someone who will be sensitive to both environmental and business concerns to head New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation. The trouble is that Mr. Pataki may be on the verge of appointing a Cuomo administration holdover whose track record on environmental matters makes him an inappropriate choice to be chief steward of the state's threatened natural resources.   A \"very strong candidate\" for the top D.E.C. post, according to the Governor, is Michael Zagata. Unlike some of Mr. Pataki's appointees, Mr. Zagata, at least, is not a political crony or relative of one. He served at the D.E.C. under Gov. Mario Cuomo, who named him to the amorphous new position of Business Ambassador just before the election, in an apparent nod to commerce. Before that Mr. Zagata spent 14 years working for various oil and gas companies. He forged a career on the wrong side of some big environmental questions. For example, he advocated the proposal, wisely rejected by Congress, to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. He has also supported a misguided concept called \"mitigation banking,\" which would allow companies to develop protected wetlands on the promise to create new, ecologically suspect sanctuaries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/nyregion/no-headline-202995.html","abstract":"  \"We didn't have a college fund for Michelle.

Although there are daredevils who play the complete set in concert (several have done so in recent New York seasons), most cellists play one suite on a program, surrounded by works in different styles. Indeed, Bach might have looked askance at anyone willing either to play or to hear all six works in a sitting or two.   But on recordings, resistance to the compendium approach is largely futile. The medium imposes the expectation that works of a feather will flock together, concert hall esthetics notwithstanding. Besides, the suites fit handily on two CD's and make powerful calling cards for cellists. And there's a machismo issue. Barring extenuating circumstances, a recording that offers only selections from the series is tacitly regarded as an installment toward a complete traversal or a sign that the musician who made it is an eccentric or a wimp.   This approach puts a strain on cellists' imaginations, which is not necessarily a bad thing. As remarkably varied as these suites are once one looks into them, they are similar in their externals. And however fondly one regards the sound of the cello, it can become monotonous in the two and a quarter hours it takes to play the suites. The challenge for a cellist, therefore, is to magnify the variety Bach wrote into the set.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"Tree Tips Over, and a Block Rises Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-tree-tips-over-and-a-block-rises-up.html","abstract":"  There are 19 trees on 100th Street between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive.

In the largest exhibition of his work ever mounted -- more than 600 works -- the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin is now seeking to portray him as a multitalented figure who skipped effortlessly from expressionism to Dada to realism, not simply a master of painting and drawing but also a photographer, poet, collagist, designer, illustrator, pornographer, dandy and outraged opponent of Nazism.    Grosz was an artist who thrived on contradictions, and many of them are visible in \"George Grosz: Berlin-New York,\" which opened last month and runs through April 17.

Unrepentantly partisan, it has glorified the homegrown and avoided pretension in its mission to frame the humor, poetry and music of what is sometimes called the street, defined as anything American, anything separate from the academy. And the party, which runs Tuesday through Sunday, explains where the club has been: Allen Ginsberg, Shirley Horn, Bobby Short, Dick Gregory, Pete Seeger and Professor Irwin Corey are all showing up to pay tribute and to perform.   That list -- and the staggering lineup of performers over the years, from Barbra Streisand and Woody Allen to John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk -- also suggests that the Vanguard, small, underground and unprepossesing, has been a witness to and participant in a startling transformation: the elevation of its esthetic from the marginal and hip to the mainstream. The Vanguard has been a shrine for what is good about this century, and the century has caught up with it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"ART;\nThe Overblown 80's Prove Persistent Indeed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/art-the-overblown-80s-prove-persistent-indeed.html","abstract":"THE 1980's in the visual arts, as well as in the rest of culture, are in an anomalous position.

The works on display reveal an attitude that is expansive to the point of overreaching. This attitude is only beginning to be overtaken by a general feeling of retrenchment that marks the 90's.\n\nThe exhibition consists of drawings, many of them as large as wall murals, by the major artists of the decade -- those who came of age during the 80's, who made their reputations then and in some cases are having trouble holding on to those reputations now. They include Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Eric Fischl and Jeff Koons. Other artists are perennial. They were major players before the 80's and continue to be.

Two more movies are still to come: Michael Blakemore's \"Country Life,\" set in the Australian outback, with John Hargreaves as Vanya, and \"August,\" in which Anthony Hopkins will assume the part and which he will also direct.   On Thursday, Tom Courtenay, who became an overnight star in his debut in the 1962 film \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\" opens in \"Uncle Vanya\" at Circle in the Square in a production with ties to the Royal Exchange Theater in Manchester, England. Among the cast is Werner Klemperer as the aging professor, whose arrival at the country estate with his beautiful young wife, Yelena (Amanda Donohoe), causes confusion and discord.

It was the summer of 1993. I hadn't been to Russia in six years and had decided it was high time I went again. My 20-year-old son, Nick, was enjoying his last long vacation before finals. One of his subjects was revolution. He said he'd come along. I said good and offered secret prayers to my Maker. I didn't quite know what we'd be getting up to, but we were unlikely to be keeping to the safe side of the street.\n\nThe West, it seemed to me, had dishonored every pledge we had made during the cold war. We continued to protect the strong against the weak. When small nations were butchered, the best we could manage was the tutting of an anxious bystander. (And the British seemed to know better than anyone every reason in the book for doing nothing.) And while we squandered the peace, I felt, we hunted wistfully for a new means of dividing the world for our greater comfort and safety, now that the Communist thing, rather regrettably, had gone away.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"An Air of Mystery in Building on 62d Street","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-east-side-an-air-of-mystery-in-building-on-62d-street.html","abstract":"  It's not unusual to see office building workers clustered by the front door taking smoking breaks.

I visited Berlin and Checkpoint Charlie in May and was quite disappointed. I walked past Rainer Hildebrandt's Checkpoint Charlie Museum, and although I was interested, did not enter. In part, it was the admission price, probably higher because of the loss of grants.    But I was also dismayed that barely five years since one of the most historic events of the second half of this century, there is only minimal recognition that the checkpoint, the symbol of freedom for some and oppression for others, ever stood on Unter den Linden. Only a small sign, not even an official one, reading \"Checkpoint Charlie,\" and a few capitalists offering Cold War relics and chunks of the wall attest that this Berlin intersection has any significance. I found it ironic that I nearly got lost on my way there, almost missing a landmark that was once so unmistakable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950219","headline":"PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/nyregion/playing-in-the-neighborhood-899495.html","abstract":"  ELMHURST An Introduction To the World of Zen   \"Zen is in your mind already, and no one can open it for you,\" said the Rev.

The roads are dirt, not paved. Apart from the lone village of Codrington, population 1,200, and a few hotels, the 62 square miles are covered with scrub, cacti, hibiscus and bright red flamboyants. Wild donkeys, horses, deer and boar, along with free-ranging domestic goats and sheep, calmly graze. Forming a frame around this rather bland landscape are continuous pink and white sandy beaches. And beyond the beaches and their aquamarine waters, reefs with acres of fantastically shaped coral and gloriously hued tropical fish protect this peaceful retreat from cruise ships and other potential intruders.\n\nDuring a vacation with a friend last winter on this Leeward island 28 miles north of Antigua, I spent my first few days on the beach. My hotel, the Palmetto, was politely situated just back from the sand, so its architecture did not intrude. The only manmade structures on the beach were six white wooden cubes with chairs offering a rest in the shade. This beach, on a peninsula called Palmetto Point, had larger waves rolling onto its eastern shores and calmer waters facing west. The sand glittered pink. It was, on close inspection, not pink sand but tiny pink shells, sprinkled on the shore by the incoming tide. Aside from a few little lizards darting in the bushes behind us, and the island of Nevis far off on the horizon, there was no sign of life in any direction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950219","time":"1995-02-19

Early last year, a 46-year-old professional from Nashville, Bob Glenn, embarked on an ambitious tournament program, hoping to win the title for collecting most master points in the calendar year. He did not feel well, and in March was told that he had inoperable pancreatic cancer, but he went on playing, and winning, until he died in June. He had accumulated more than 1,000 master points in five months.   For some, it appears that the drive to succeed at the bridge table helps keeps health problems at bay. An example is Lila Perlstein of Roslyn Heights, L.I., an expert who, despite a chronic illness, won two major titles last month at the Tri-State Regional Championships in Port Chester, N.Y. Six weeks earlier, at the Fall Nationals in Minneapolis, she held the South cards on the diagramed deal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950220","headline":"Chinese Executive Tied to Deng Is Arrested in Corruption Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/world/chinese-executive-tied-to-deng-is-arrested-in-corruption-case.html","abstract":"  In a corruption case that strikes close to China's first family, a prominent steel company chairman and close friend of Deng Xiaoping has resigned and his son has been arrested for \"certain commercial crimes,\" Chinese officials said this weekend.
