We arrived by bus from Badgastein on a beautiful sun-filled day. Although it was early in the season, snow conditions above the chairlift, aided by grooming, were the best in the valley. The ride on the Kreuzkogellift was exhilarating and the alpine scene from the peak was the most spectacular in the valley. We enjoyed a hot lunch at midstation in a modern cafeteria, using precisely the method the author described, ordering via the attractive photos of the selections.   The author missed the skiing highlight of Sportgastein, the Heilstollen. Departing from the backside of the mountain, this eight-mile descent brings the hardy skier to a bus stop on the mountain road between Badgastein and Sportgastein. Thus it is best run first thing in the morning to catch the arriving buses to Sportgastein or as a last run to catch the final bus back to Badgastein.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"In Search of Edith Wharton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/travel/in-search-of-edith-wharton.html","abstract":"IT was before the new, best-selling \"Age of Innocence,\" with Michelle Pfeiffer, orgasmic, on the cover: a hot, dusty day in France in 1990.

Many of the better-known names of the American dynasties spent the winter at the hotel and guests for the most part were members in good standing of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant establishment.   Just as Palm Beach has changed, so has the Breakers: dress is more casual, the crowd a mixture of the establishment, the new affluence and business men and women. But the imposing twin-towered Italian Renaissance building, set in 140 lush acres, 15 minutes from the airport and five minutes from downtown Palm Beach, is still luxurious, conservative as hotels go these days, and drop-dead impressive, with the old-fashioned elegance of a majestic dowager. Long gone, though, is the staff member responsible for inspecting the stockings of womens' bathing costumes, insuring that they were dark enough to conceal the flesh underneath.

In THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH: The World Within (Clarkson Potter, $30), Juliet Gardiner adeptly chronicles both the outer world of the grim Yorkshire town of Haworth, where the Bronte children spent most of their lives with their highly educated but eccentric father, the Rev. Patrick Bronte, and the inner world of the imagination to which each sibling turned, first in childhood and then throughout adulthood, for solace in the wake of relentless tragedy. As young children, they witnessed the sudden deaths of their mother and then of their two oldest sisters, Maria and Elizabeth. In the years that followed, with the exception of brief forays at schools, a few trips, scattered attempts at positions outside of Haworth and Charlotte's marriage only a few months before her death at the age of 38, the Bronte siblings spent their time cloistered on the one hand by the secluded atmosphere of their father's austerely furnished parsonage, and surrounded on the other by the vast, windswept expanse of the Yorkshire moors. All four children conjured fantastical characters and kingdoms in miniature \"novels,\" diaries, poems and mock newspapers -- so-called juvenilia that would put many adult writers to shame. Ms. Gardiner, the author of \"The People's War\" and \"Over Here: The G.I.'s in Wartime Britain,\" quotes generously from these documents, as well as from the Bronte sisters' novels, family letters and Elizabeth Gaskell's classic biography of Charlotte Bronte. The books also include fascinating drawings and watercolors by the multitalented family. Ms. Gardiner provides an excellent overview of the Brontes and an insightful journey into the artistic imagination.

The results for 1993 were \"clearly mixed,\" said Mayco Villafana of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitor's Bureau. The state estimates that the number of visitors to Florida increased by 1.9 percent, to about 41.3 million, but acknowledges that the bulk of that growth came before September, when the killing of first a German and then a British tourist produced a wave of canceled trips in markets around the world.   Europeans in particular still appear to be nervous about vacationing in Florida, especially Miami. Robert Todak, general manager of Art Deco Hotels, a group of four hotels in the chic South Beach area of Miami Beach, said there \"has been a definite decrease in European travel into South Beach\" in the last quarter of 1993. \"Primarily we deal with European tour operators, and they are down.\" Tourism officials suggest that not just violence, but unfavorable changes in exchange rates and an economic slowdown in Europe have also contributed to the drop.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"The Other Side of the Wall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/books/the-other-side-of-the-wall.html","abstract":"  ON THE EDGE  A History of Poor Black Children and Their American Dreams.

Many Caribbean islands have white sand, aquamarine seas and lush mountains, but few display luxury goods in such abundance. A commercial hub long before Blackbeard prowled its waters, St. Thomas is now a prime destination for cruise ships, whose passengers rush ashore -- quite in the spirit of 18th-century buccaneers -- in pursuit of duty-free booty.    Others still come to get away from it all, even if a wave of development that followed Hurricane Hugo in 1989 sometimes gives a jolt of urban American reality. Along with new resorts and fast-food restaurants, there is now a Kmart and a Hard Rock Cafe, and luxurious homes have blossomed like frangipani on the northern and eastern hills. The sidewalks and narrow alleys of downtown Charlotte Amalie (pronounced ah-MAHL-ya), the territorial capital and St. Thomas's only real town, prove that there can be gridlock in paradise.  Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas's first permanent European settlement, dates from 1671. Set on a grand circular harbor, the town was laid out by planners in Denmark who had never seen the mountainous, 32-square-mile island, and it has kept much of its colonial charm. (Facing a plan mandating streets on near-vertical surfaces, local builders substituted long stairways; exploration by foot is thus strenuous but rewarding.) With a paucity of through streets and vertigo-inducing roads through the mountains, driving is an exercise in patience and caution, particularly because traffic moves on the left, in cars with left-hand drive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Playing the Fairest of the Florida Fairways","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/travel/playing-the-fairest-of-the-florida-fairways.html","abstract":"I'M about to experience in the flesh every hacker's lifetime fantasy.

And, at the same time, at the Pavilions of Buckland Farms in Manchester just north of Interstate 84, a man on a mountain bike was weaving among cars, keeping a sharp eye on hundreds, and at times thousands, of vehicles parked in the huge lot.   All three were looking for the same thing: car thieves or others intent on breaking into parked cars. In mall parking lots and garages, car theft has become the major form of crime. During the past year, 367 cars were reported stolen at the state's five largest shopping malls, and many have not been recovered.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Consolidated Edison Urged To Freeze Electrical Rates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/nyregion/consolidated-edison-urged-to-freeze-electrical-rates.html","abstract":"  Consolidated Edison, which has been pursuing a 2 percent rate increase for several months, should instead freeze its electricity rates for at least one year, the New York State Attorney General, G.

But semantic chicanery is a given in the United States. Consider Rome, N.Y., and Paris, Me. \n\nAt least in Naples there is a reason of sorts for the name. The area was christened in the 1880's, when journalists were touting Florida as the Italy of America -- a restorative land offering sun, joie de vivre and superlativefishing. And Naples, like its sister city, nestles on an inland bay along the western flank of a large land mass. To those who have vacationed on Florida's Atlantic coast, this affluent resort community that swells to 33,000 in peak season may seem an oddity.  The fine sand, like confectioner's sugar, is the first thing one notices. Its origins are somewhat less than romantic, however, the waste produced by coral-eating fish having played a prominent role. Then too, the Everglades are close at hand -- a 40-minute drive -- giving Naples that clearing-on-the-edge-of-the-backwoods feel, particularly if one approaches from Alligator Alley, the highway crossing the state from Fort Lauderdale. The image of Naples circa 1880 as described in a local Chamber of Commerce brochure -- overrun with palmetto scrub, razor-sharp grass and clouds of mosquitoes -- isn't much of a stretch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"As Bosnians Gain Militarily, They Lose Status as Victims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/world/as-bosnians-gain-militarily-they-lose-status-as-victims.html","abstract":"  Torn from their homes, bombarded in their encircled capital, deprived of food, water and warmth, the Muslims have been the primary victims of the war here.

Early reviews were nearly unanimous raves, but a sneaky condescension showed through. The wonder, these rapturous reviews hinted, was not that a powerful film had been made about the Holocaust but that Peter Pan had made it.    It took a few weeks for the backlash to set in, as the discussion moved from the entertainment pages to the op-ed pages and talk shows. The old Spielberg rap -- too entertaining for his own good -- came back to haunt him. Why did he make a movie about a righteous Nazi? this argument goes.

When Mr. Hawkins saw a version he wanted, he had several couples dance it in unison, then in succession.    Finally, he asked to see just one couple perform the step. \"I think that's it,\" he exclaimed, a hint of excitement in his voice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Peres and Arafat Unite in Mourning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/world/peres-and-arafat-unite-in-mourning.html","abstract":"  Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, came together today to mourn the man who helped mediate the Israeli-Palestinian accord but failed in talks later to resolve differences on a plan to introduce Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.

Jerry Jecewicz, pastor of Brooklyn's Holy Spirit Church, he wanted to be a magician. After his ordination 18 years ago, his vocation and avocation were intertwined in the form of 'The Priesto Magic Spectacular,\" a show that stars Father Jecewicz in priestly collar and top hat. In apparent defiance of the laws of nature, he makes his duck, Dudley, disappear, escapes from a locked trunk and causes a woman to float in midair.    Every so often, he says, he is contronted by someone who claims that \"magic is deception and is therefore an opening for the Devil.\" But Father Jecewicz insists that he practices \"honest\" magic -- entertainment, not deception. It is also a boon for his parish, since the money he raises with his show goes to support the Holy Spirit School; since his arrival there in 1991, he has performed at church events throughout New York and earned $25,000 for the school.

Then why are steakhouses doing so well, with new ones opening and reservations hard to get in all of them?   The answer is that an increasing number of people are not cooking beef at home, but when they dine out they want a terrific, tender, beefy slab of perfectly charred steak. This makes sense. The quality of well-aged sirloin or porterhouse that a good restaurant can obtain is usually superior to that available for home cooks. And the kind of high-heat grills with which restaurants are routinely equipped usually do a far better job of cooking a steak than a home broiler or grill, even an outdoor grill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Small Store, Big Move","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/style/small-store-big-move.html","abstract":"  FOR more than 40 years, Jimmy's has been a Brooklyn landmark, offering high-fashion men's and women's clothes to a well-heeled clientele that finds comfort in its family atmosphere.

Mr. Sekiguchi is the first real business contact corralled by New York State economic development officials to test a program to increase exports by black-owned businesses to Japan. B3.

For almost 20 years, the family was imprisoned by King Hassan II, said Miss Oufkir, a slight 32-year-old woman, who recounted their story in two interviews.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"We Can't Cover Everyone for Every Ailment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/opinion/l-we-can-t-cover-everyone-for-every-ailment-979449.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York was right when he stated on national television that \"we don't have a health care crisis in America\" (front page, Jan. 14), provided he was referring to a crisis in unlimited medical care for everyone on demand.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Q&A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/science/q-a-978124.html","abstract":"  Snowflakes   Q.

Two 30-year-olds showed collections this season. Maurizio Galante of Rome emphasized the intricate handwork of the artisan in his second Paris show. Gerald Watelet arrived unheralded on the last day and voila, there is a new name to cope with.   He went to hotel school, not a fashion academy, and worked in restaurants before starting his own couture collection in Brussels in 1988. After five years, he decided it was time to storm the citadel of world fashion and, surprise, he was ready. His mentors are Courreges and Saint Laurent, and he has carried their looks further into the modern era.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Sports of The Times; Rooting Against 4 Monkeys","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/sports/sports-of-the-times-rooting-against-4-monkeys.html","abstract":"  SOME people call it the Super Bowl rematch \"nobody wanted,\" but the Bills wanted it and so did everybody wearing a red-white-and-blue parka in Buffalo.

The Dutch pair that finished last helped the Netherlands win the world team title in September.   It is not easy to decide whether North-South should bid to six clubs on the diagramed deal, and the players were split down the middle: four bid the slam and went down, and the other four rested comfortably in four spades. Twelve tricks can be made easily if both black suits divide 3-2, and there are some very slight extra chances.

The data, from spacecraft meant to watch for rocket firings and nuclear explosions, were declassified recently by the Defense Department and are to appear later this year in a book.    From 1975 to 1992, the satellites detected 136 explosions high in the atmosphere, an average of eight a year. The blasts are calculated to have intensities roughly equal to 500 to 15,000 tons of high explosive, or the power of small atomic bombs. Experts who have analyzed the data are publishing it in the book, \"Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids,\" say that the detection rate is probably low and that the actual bombardment rate might be 10 times higher, with 80 or so blasts occurring each year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Tennis Center Scores Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/sports/tennis-tennis-center-scores-again.html","abstract":"  The controversial plans for the $180 million expansion of the National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park have survived another hurdle by incurring no legal suits during a four-month period that followed the project's Sept. 23 acceptance by the City Council.

For by then Mr. Shaw, in his inimitably earthy manner, had presided over a weeklong humanistic exercise of the highest order.   It didn't seem so at the start. The first rehearsals of the adult chorus, last Tuesday at the Manhattan Center in midtown, struck an observer who has always admired Mr. Shaw's results as oddly mechanistic affairs. Mr. Shaw's method is to isolate aspects of the music: rhythm, for example, through the singing of beat numbers instead of text; or enunciation, with words chanted on a single pitch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940125","headline":"Knicks Not Equal to the Sum of Their Parts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-not-equal-to-the-sum-of-their-parts.html","abstract":"  Charles Smith is back.
