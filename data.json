Her poems feverishly anatomized her moods, her breakdowns, her anxieties, her marriage and her divorce, and they created a continuing self-portrait: Sexton the rebellious teen-ager, obsessed with boys \"and cigarettes and cars\"; Sexton the middle-aged suburban housewife who \"wore rubies and bought tomatoes\"; Sexton the stressed-out mother haunted by \"ugly angels\"; Sexton the emotional invalid, \"queen of this summer hotel\" known as Bedlam.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"A Novelist Sharing Her Lover","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/movies/film-review-a-novelist-sharing-her-lover.html","abstract":"  Diane Kurys's best films carry a resonance beyond the lives of their distinctive characters: \"Peppermint Soda\" is the sweetly comic tale of adolescent girls coming of age, and \"Entre Nous\" the incisive story of female friendship set against World War II and its aftermath. Her lesser films are smaller but still engrossing pictures of tangled relationships, like \"A Man in Love\" and her new work, \"Love After Love,\" the fine, quirky story of a novelist named Lola (Isabelle Huppert). Lola doesn't make that grand artistic leap into the universal, even though her love life sounds like a case study out of \"Smart Women, Foolish Choices.\"    Lola has tried to be reasonable about love, but at 35 the complications are piling up like dirty laundry. She lives with an architect named David, with whom she has a long-term relationship. Along the way, David also became openly involved with Marianne, with whom he has two sons and a continuing connection. Lola accepts this as part of the modern world of grown-ups. Yet she has recently begun a secret affair with Tom, a married songwriter who has two small daughters. \"The two men I love have children,\" she writes in her journal, moaning about the inconvenience of this rather than questioning her own judgment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"Sports of The Times; Socialism Keeps Pack In Green Bay","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/sports/sports-of-the-times-socialism-keeps-pack-in-green-bay.html","abstract":"  EVERY time I hear the name \"Green Bay,\" I conjure up the image of blocky men in clumpy helmets flailing around in a snowstorm, green and yellow uniforms barely visible in some Arctic whiteout, the ugly smell of paper factories overpowered by the pungent aroma of homemade bratwurst.

In a crackling, tuneful voice that sounds as if it's close to falling apart (as his pop songs do), Mr. Martsch sings about everything from the erotic thrill of touching a girl's thumb during an elementary-school game of seven-up to the hip appeal of David Bowie.

The advertisement runs for 30 seconds and is being seen statewide. On the Screen: Reproductions of headlines and news organization mastheads, with announcer's voice in background. Producer: Gannon, McCarthy, Mason Ltd. Script: (Announcer) \"A Chronicle panel called her first ad 'slimy.' NBC labeled another ad the 'meanest, sneakiest' of the year. She was sued by the State of California for $8.3 million in massive financial irregularities. Her first Senate bill offered a $200 million real estate windfall The Register called a 'sweetheart' deal. And Kathleen Brown says Feinstein flip-flopped on the death penalty just to run for higher office. Feinstein -- a career politician who'll say or do anything to stay in office.\" Accuracy: The quotations are accurate in that they report the conclusions reached by the news organizations, but those conclusions were at least as subjective as analytical. The suit over financial irregularities involved sloppy, but not criminal, keeping of financial records in an earlier Feinstein campaign and resulted in a $190,000 fine by Federal election officials. Ms. Feinstein did change positions on the death penalty, but the change came long before she ran for the Senate, and Ms. Brown publicly corrected herself on that long before the Huffington advertisement went on the air. Scorecard: The advertisement is one of a several by Mr. Huffington that try to use what others have said to paint Ms. Feinstein as an opportunistic career politician who slings mud and goes out of her way to take care of special interests. From the start, that characterization has been the crux of the Huffington campaign.

On the Screen: Reproductions of headlines and unflattering words about Mr. Huffington, along with an unflattering photograph of Mr. Huffington that shrinks to a single dot. Announcer's voice in background. Producer: Morris and Carrick Script: (Announcer) \"The Chronicle says Michael Huffington is running a fraudulent campaign. Why the lies about Dianne Feinstein? Maybe to hide the truth about him. The Associated Press reports that government records describe Huffington as secretive, threatening and greedy. And Huffington's company falsified documents to cover up its violations of national security laws. His company stiffed taxpayers for millions. But Huffington still won't release his tax returns. Secretive, threatening, greedy. Congressman Huffington. The Texas oil millionaire Californians just can't trust.\" Accuracy: The \"fraudulent campaign\" conclusion was subjective, as was the accusation of \"lies.\" The quotations from the Associated Press were not based on government conclusions about Mr. Huffington but instead were opinions offered by Huffington business competitors in lawsuits. Huffington family companies have been fined by the Government for violating international trade regulations prohibiting overseas sales of law enforcement equipment, and some have encountered financial difficulties that resulted in disputes over tax liability. Mr. Huffington, a wealthy former Texan, refuses to release his tax returns. Scorecard: The advertisement is one of several by Ms. Feinstein that try to use what others have said to paint Mr. Huffington as a wealthy carpetbagger from Texas who refuses to come clean with his personal and business dealings, many inept and possibly shady, and thus cannot be trusted to serve in the Senate. That characterization has been the crux of the Feinstein campaign in the latter phases of the race.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941014","headline":"Wallmanstal Journal; Can a Post-Apartheid Army Ever Get in Step?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/world/wallmanstal-journal-can-a-post-apartheid-army-ever-get-in-step.html","abstract":"  From the day in April when disgruntled troops set their commander's car on fire, it was clear that South Africa's plan to forge a new army out of old enemies was not going to unfold without a few glitches.

The first criticism appears true; the city wants to transfer health workers off the city budget in order to create the appearance of deep personnel cuts. But the plan also makes good health-care sense.    Merging city clinics with those the H.H.C. already runs is a smart way to bring quality health care within easy reach of the city's poor. City clinics focus on immunization and other children's preventive services. H.H.C. clinics provide comprehensive primary care for the entire family. In some neighborhoods, city and H.H.C. clinics are near each other and underutilized. A merger would cut the waste. The merger allows the H.H.C. to do what the city cannot: create a network of primary-care clinics throughout the city that are backed up by hospital facilities for patients who need specialists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"An Immigrant's Lifelong Journey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/arts/art-review-an-immigrant-s-lifelong-journey.html","abstract":"  Luis Cruz Azaceta left Cuba for New York in 1960 when he was 18, just after the revolution that brought Castro to power. To judge by the lively but uneven mini-retrospective at the Alternative Museum, the move was as traumatic as it was productive. And it helped to form an art in which personal and political identities mesh.   The show begins on an unpromising note with Mr. Azaceta's cartoonish paintings from the late 70's. Among them are the harsh-colored \"Window Display\" (1979) -- a comic-paranoic view of Manhattan as a bad-dream assemblage of weapons, severed limbs and the Empire State Building stabbed through with a knife -- and a 1981 rainbow-colored self-portrait suggestive of 60's psychedelic poster art.

This quirky new restaurant with its rustic Mediterranean food seems as if it will be a boon to theatergoers. I especially liked an appetizer of white beans served on Parmesan-covered crostini with a little salad on the side.

The camera pans around the room to various Cuomo children and grandchildren listening as the patriarch talks about crime. SCRIPT Mr. Cuomo: \"We'll never forget when Matilda was mugged. And I still worry when my daughters are out alone at night. Crime touches too many of us. That's why we've doubled state prisons in taking criminals off the streets in record numbers. Now, I want to ban assault weapons and put career criminals away for life. But we also must give young people hope of a good future before they are seduced by drugs and money. We're making progress, but not enough. My job is to keep fighting to make life safer for all our families.\" SCORECARD Amid a storm of attack ads against State Senator George E. Pataki, his Republican opponent, this is Mr. Cuomo's first spot in recent weeks that focuses on his own record and plans. It operates on several levels. He lets viewers see his family -- a textbook trick for politicians seeking to seem softer or more human -- and says he has a personal reason to share their worries. He defends his record, which he has not always found easy because of his opposition to the death penalty. Finally, he says that fighting crime ultimately hinges on prevention, a message that sells big with his base of liberal and black Democratic voters.    Though firm, this is no war whoop on crime; the question is whether it is what most voters want to hear, especially from the incumbent who led the state during 12 violent years, despite three years of dropping crime statistics.

At the time of his retirement from politics in 2014, he was the world's oldest head of state and was considered the last link to Israel's founding generation."},{"title":"Oslo Accords","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords","description":"1993–1995 Israeli–Palestinian peace agreements","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Bill_Clinton%2C_Yitzhak_Rabin%2C_Yasser_Arafat_at_the_White_House_1993-09-13.jpg/320px-Bill_Clinton%2C_Yitzhak_Rabin%2C_Yasser_Arafat_at_the_White_House_1993-09-13.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":218},"abstract":"The Oslo Accords are a pair of interim agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO): the Oslo I Accord, signed in Washington, D.C., in 1993; and the Oslo II Accord, signed in Taba, Egypt, in 1995. They marked the start of the Oslo process, a peace process aimed at achieving a peace treaty based on Resolution 242 and Resolution 338 of the United Nations Security Council.

at this season's first performance of Richard Strauss's \"Arabella\" at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday night, was the voice of the composer. The orchestra was its vehicle, making pronouncements that were compassionate and ironic, invoking waltzes and polkas, Slavic folk tunes and Mozartean allusions. And as conducted by Christian Thielemann, the young German musician who made his impressive Met debut leading \"Der Rosenkavalier\" two seasons ago, the orchestra was also the dominant force of the opera, not supporting the singers so much as daring them to hang on for the lush, exotic ride.   Mr. Thielemann often erred on the side of overly emphatic gesture, and occasionally seemed so swept up in Strauss's intoxicating flow of motif and melody that the singers seemed extraneous. There were many times, too, partly because of the symphonic size of the orchestral sound and partly because of the generally wan character of the cast, when the singers had no choice but to remain extraneous.   10-15-94","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/style/chronicle-538370.html","abstract":"  When LINDA SUNSHINE, an editor at Stewart, Tabori & Chang, first had the idea of pairing the words of NTOZAKE SHANGE with the paintings of the late Romare Bearden in a book, she had no idea that the two had ever met, much less had a longstanding friendship.

ROBB, DEMOCRAT The Robb campaign began showing this 30-second commercial statewide on Thursday, in part as a response to a new North campaign commercial that began on Wednesday. PRODUCER: Doak Shrum Harris Carrier Devine of Arlington, Va. ON THE SCREEN: Alternating images of Mr. Robb, talking to voters, and Mr. North, in Marine uniform, with newspaper headlines from the Iran-contra scandal like \"North lied to conceal gift, witness tells jury.\" SCRIPT: After lying about President Reagan and even lying to schoolchildren, now Oliver North is lying about Chuck Robb. Chuck Robb has never had anything to do with illegal drugs. Period.   But what North doesn't understand is that the real issue in this campaign is the candidate's record of public service. Chuck Robb has a proven record of public service, while North's public record includes putting himself above the law by selling arms to terrorists and backdating documents to conceal that some of the money went for his personal use.   Oliver North. People are starting to wonder if he knows what the truth is. ACCURACY: Mr. North recently told some high school students he did not lie to Congress. He did so under the assumption, he said later, that the questioner was referring to his open Congressional testimony, which Mr. North has always said was truthful. Mr. North has acknowledged misleading members of Congress in closed session. The assertion about drugs is based on Mr. Robb's denials of accusations that he attended parties where people were using illegal drugs. He has acknowledged attending the parties in question. The accusations that he knew of the drug use or was somehow involved have never been proved, but have trailed him for years. SCORECARD: The commercial would appear to be of the preaching-to-the-converted variety, reflecting accusations against Mr. North that are well-known to Virginia voters and, in general, do not seem to bother North supporters. If the commercial is aimed at North supporters or even the shrinking population of undecided voters in the state, it does not look or sound incendiary enough to lure people into the Robb camp, especially because the episodes cited have been thoroughly examined before. OLIVER L. NORTH, REPUBLICAN In his latest advertising assault, a 30-second commercial running throughout Virginia, Mr. North uses newspaper headlines and a Playboy magazine cover to dramatize his view of Mr. Robb as a flawed candidate. PRODUCER: Murphy Pintak and Gautier Agency of Arlington, Va. ON THE SCREEN: A black and white, slow-motion close-up shot of Mr. Robb serves as background for reproductions of newspaper articles, a Playboy cover and a list of four Robb acquaintances convicted of drug charges. SCRIPT: Why can't Chuck Robb tell the truth? About the cocaine parties where Robb said he never saw drugs. Then four of his party friends were sent to prison for dealing cocaine. Or about the beauty queen in the hotel room in New York. Robb says it was only a massage.   Chuck Robb lived a lie and violated his oath of good faith to the people, writes The Richmond Times-Dispatch. Character counts, and North has it all over Robb. ACCURACY: With provocative, suggestive references to issues that have dogged Mr. Robb since the 1980's, the commercial leaves the impression Mr. Robb has not provided a full accounting of the events, which occurred when he was Governor. Mr. Robb has acknowledged attending parties, and people he knew were convicted of drug offenses. He has always said that he never saw drugs being used and that he never used them. He has admitted having had relationship with the woman on the Playboy cover, Tai Collins, a former Miss Virginia, whom the magazine cover identifies as \"the woman Senator Charles Robb couldn't resist,\" but Mr. Robb said the relationship only went so far as the one night in New York, where he said she gave him a massage. SCORECARD: In a scorching attack on Mr. Robb's character that plays well to the conservative Republicans who support Mr. North, the commercial relies on hot-button phrases like \"cocaine parties,\" \"dealing cocaine\" and \"beauty queen\" and an image of a Playboy centerfold to link Mr. Robb with questionable behavior. Mr. Robb has never been proved to have been involved with drugs, and he has apologized to his wife, Linda, and voters for conduct \"not appropriate for a married man.\" Further, by asserting that Mr. North's character is superior to Mr. Robb's, the commercial presumes that flaws of a professional nature, like Mr. North's involvement in the Iran-contra scandal, are less offensive than flaws of a personal nature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941015","headline":"BRIEFCASE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/your-money/IHT-briefcase.html","abstract":"In next week's Money Report: a survey of international real estate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"Let's Look Closer at Border Control Numbers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/opinion/l-let-s-look-closer-at-border-control-numbers-538396.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   You report on a crackdown on illegal crossings at the United States-Mexico border in an Oct. 6 news article.

Let it not be forgotten that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, Israel's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, were also honored for their contribution to the most important peacemaking development of the last year -- the framework agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.    Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres both played key roles in securing the peace agreement, and the Nobel Committee was right to have them share the honor. The two fought bitterly over the leadership and direction of Israel's Labor Party for many years. But they set aside their differences, and Mr. Rabin's well-earned skepticism about P.L.O. reliability, to seize a historic opportunity for peacemaking. In doing so, they at first responded to, and then went on to lead, a dramatic change in Israeli public opinion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"Ammonia Leak Forces Office Evacuation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/nyregion/ammonia-leak-forces-office-evacuation.html","abstract":"  An ammonia leak from an ice-making system at a wholesale seafood company today forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 employees from 13 buildings in a business park here.

It would also prefer not having to wait until Iraqi troops actually cross the Kuwaiti border before the sheikdom's defenders can strike back.   Washington is now canvassing support for a Security Council resolution that would demand that Iraq withdraw the reinforcements and special units it recently moved south. From now on, under the resolution, Iraq would have to limit its forces in southern Iraq to those present before the latest crisis began, and even these would have to avoid threatening deployments near the Kuwaiti border. Those demands are justified, given Baghdad's repeated threats and menacing actions. The vote could come as soon as today.    Most other members of the international coalition that has worked together containing Iraq for the past four years support those demands. But how to enforce them is another matter. China, Russia and France, among others, are reluctant to follow up the resolution with an explicit threat of force against offending Iraqi troop movements so long as they are confined to Iraqi territory.    American interests in the region are strong enough to justify unilateral U.S. military action in certain circumstances. But the Clinton Administration should be extremely cautious about driving new wedges into an already divided coalition or setting precedents for unilateral action that others might exploit -- for example, Russia in the case of former Soviet Republics.   China's main concern is sovereignty and protection of its own freedom of action from U.N. intrusion. Russia and France are frankly interested in doing business with an internationally rehabilitated Iraq. All three also have good reasons to discourage future Iraqi aggression. But they insist that Saddam Hussein's behavior, including his cooperation with arms inspectors, can most effectively be influenced not merely by threats and punishments but by a careful combination of positive and negative incentives.    No doubt the U.S. and its British allies alone can manage the military defense of Kuwait. But denying Iraq the ability to sell its oil or buy new weapons on the international market requires maintaining a consensus of all major and Mideastern powers.    That consensus was already in danger of fraying a few weeks ago on the oil sanctions issue because of Washington's overly creative interpretation of U.N. resolutions spelling out what Iraq had to do to get relief. By rashly sending its troops southward, Baghdad reunited the allies and temporarily patched up the divisions over future oil sales.    But any new U.S. attempt to go beyond a Security Council consensus on enforcement risks doing more harm than good. It would move the U.S. military closer to the unenviable role of global police force, even as it weakened the long-term containment of Iraq.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"Now Esiason Can Move; Jets Hope to Do Same","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/sports/pro-football-now-esiason-can-move-jets-hope-to-do-same.html","abstract":"  If the Jets defeat the Patriots Sunday -- and just because it's at home doesn't guarantee a smashing performance -- Coach Pete Carroll might want to consider giving a game ball to the trainers.

The five had an open trial by an independent court. Video recording of the interrogation made public by the prosecutor tarnished claims by four defendants of being tortured or intimidated by electric chair, a practice that is nonexistent in Albania.   At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg this month the chairman, Klaus Kinkel of Germany, declared that \"the trial procedures observed Albanian law, and there was no tendency to influence the courts.\"   It is regrettable to see the Greek minority in Albania become an instrument of the questionable policies of Athens and the hypernationalist elements of the Greek lobby in the United States.   Since the fall of the Communist regime the situation of the Greek minority has tremendously improved. It has schools, from elementary to university level, where 62 percent of the teaching is in Greek. It publishes three independent newspapers and has its own broadcasts.    The ethnic Greeks in Albania move freely to Greece (so far as Greece lets them in). They hold unrestricted religious services and have a political party, the Human Rights Union, with two elected representatives in Parliament.   The size of the Greek minority has been exaggerated. A reliable index would be the votes gathered by their party in national elections. The highest turnout for the Human Rights Union came in July 1992, with 49,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the electorate.

It is hard to explain how a land whose lush pastures nourish dairy and beef herds, whose kitchen gardens and orchards yield sweet strawberries and herbs, whose moors pullulate with lambs and game, and whose cold, clean waters brim with seafood gained a reputation for overboiled cabbage, overdone meat, potatoes with everything.   But a new generation of chefs is restoring the nation's culinary honor. Whereas only a few years ago the better cooks confined themselves almost exclusively to country-house hotels, today Dublin's increasing prominence as a financial center enables it to support some remarkably distinguished restaurants. If their menus have Continental embellishments, each of these three has a character as particular to Dublin as a pint of hand-drawn Guinness. The Commons Restaurant    The most conspicuous newcomer to the Dublin restaurant scene, the three-and-a-half-year-old Commons Restaurant, occupies the basement of two elegant 18th-century houses on the south side of St. Stephen's Green.   Collectively, the buildings are known as Newman House, for it was under their sumptuous plasterwork that the writer and theologian John Henry Newman gave substance to his \"Idea of a University,\" serving as the first rector of the Catholic University of Ireland, the institution that grew into University College Dublin. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote and taught there in the 1880's, and James Joyce, a student of philosophy and English there at the turn of the century, set part of \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in its rooms.   No wonder Michael Fitzgerald pressed for the opportunity to open a restaurant in what until the late 1950's had served as the student canteen. He spent 15 months supervising the remodeling of the basement and the garden behind. The result is a discreet, consistent and stylish haven, more home to corporate pinstripes than student jeans.    The restaurant seats only 40 at generously spaced round tables, each covered with not one but two beige tablecloths. A spectacular flower arrangement occupies a central slate table framed by a pair of columns, but attention shifts to the collection of paintings on Joycean themes specially commissioned from local artists by Mr. Fitzgerald, who revels in pointing out Louis Le Brocquy's striking \"Image of James Joyce.\"    The food is as imposing as the setting, with fixed-price menus changing daily. The head chef, Michael Bolster, a native of County Cork who trained in Britain, delights in juxtaposing Irish products with French delicacies, pairing, say, lobster mousse with braised Puy lentils and black pudding with foie gras.    We opted for savory duck confit, its unctuousness cut with muscat grapes and beets, and a warm parsnip and caramel timbale, which all by itself redeems the reputation of that maligned vegetable.    Mr. Bolster's seafood, much of it purchased direct from small cooperatives on the south coast, is prepared with split-second precision, witness the firm-fleshed John Dory on which I lunched recently. Its chive-strewn white-butter sauce was at once light and sassy, providing an urbane foil to the accompanying colcannon, a classic Irish melange of cabbage and potato, here whipped to a fluff. Lamb with sun-dried tomatoes arrived pink as requested; it was so good that my guest yearned for a more generous helping. The side vegetables played textural counterpoint, crisp broccoli contrasting with well seasoned carrot puree, new potatoes alongside saffron-tinctured duchesse potatoes.   Desserts are modern readings of classics, artfully presented. Who can resist a sinful chocolate roulade filled with white chocolate mousse or fragrant warm apple strudel accompanied by cinnamon cream? At dinner a cheese board laden with half a dozen of Ireland's finest poses a dilemma. How does one choose between mild Cashel Blue, Camembert-like St. Killian, or washed-rind Milleens -- all in tip-top condition? Slivers of each are essential to any cheese-lover's education, or so we discovered.   Wines, too, are up to the mark, with a long, well balanced list. Having decided to drink wine in a country where the (very high) taxes on alcohol are based on volume rather than value, one might as well drink better vintages. At The Commons a pleasant 1993 Sancerre runs $32, whereas twice that buys an outstanding 1991 Condrieu.    The Commons has lived up to University College Dublin's motto, \"ad astra,\" \"to the stars,\" at least partially by winning a first Michelin star last spring. The chef who garnered that honor has moved on, but Michael Bolster and his polished team of 9 chefs and a dozen waiters seem well equipped to maintain the standard. Roly's Bistro    Nearly two years ago, at the height of the recession in Ireland, a group of catering professionals opened a 150-seat \"bistro\" deep in Dublin 4, the home of Ireland's chattering classes. Against all the odds, Roly's Bistro, named for the restaurant's red-bearded greeter and mastermind, has been a near sellout ever since. Its recipe: a top-flight chef using the best materials, reasonable prices based on high turnover and an attractive, buzzy ambiance.   Colin O'Daly heads a staff of 24 chefs. This most resolutely Irish of chefs, locally trained, offers modern renditions of a broad variety of native dishes, changing his menus at least twice a month. Thus his fillet of beef may be accompanied by boxty; this medley of mashed and grated potatoes enriched with melted butter, originating in County Cavan, has supplanted gratin dauphinoise in my potato pantheon. Most of us recoil from the notion of blood sausage, but Mr. O'Daly's Clonakilty black pudding, sauced with sage-infused tomatoes, converts even the most squeamish to this country staple.   Mr. O'Daly also toys with exotic accents. His Dublin Bay prawns, perhaps more familiar to us as langoustines, come with beautiful saffron tagliatelle, and snappy cucumbers and fennel, and his lamb from the Wicklow Mountains just south of Dublin has the added tang of apricots and ginger.   We admired Mr. O'Daly's approach as we settled down to delicate warm scallop mousse sharpened with lemon balm and Colin's prawn bisque, a full-flavored yet light shellfish essence. Monkfish, sauced with nettles and hazelnuts, and a scallop of wild salmon, set off by the acid of both sorrel and spinach, were firm-flaked, their tastes fresh and defined.    On advice, we opted for creme brulee. Lest regulars tire of its silken shimmer, Colin O'Daly regularly alternates its flavoring. On this evening he had added a hint of maple syrup and a dollop of crunchy walnut ice cream on the side. Desserts here tend toward schoolboy favorites such as queen of puddings -- bread pudding layered with red-fruit jam and crowned with meringue.    The relatively short wine list, revised monthly, runs mostly to European wines. The Chablis Premier Cru '90 from A. Regnard ($31.75) is an exceptional value.   Such good food naturally breeds good cheer, which is compounded by the surroundings: daffodil-colored walls, comfortable seating and eager clients. In spite of the high turnover, customers rarely feel pressured, thanks to a well-staggered reservation system and an alert young dining-room team.  Locks    For atmosphere and choice food, Locks is hard to beat. Situated along the reedy Grand Canal, which marks the southern boundary of the Georgian part of the city, Locks exudes Irish charm with a rustic inflection that has endeared the place to Dubliners for the past 14 years. Theater people, in particular, seem to congregate here.   After ringing the doorbell, diners are shown in, as often as not by the Danish-born owner, Claire Douglas, who graciously seats them beside the bar. Over drinks they can peruse a menu and take in the neighboring 50-seat dining room. An eclectic feast of 19th- and 20th-century engravings and lithographs lines the cream walls, and hoop-backed Victorian chairs face old-rose-colored banquettes across white-napped tables arrayed on worn Oriental rugs.   The menu is at one with the decor: reassuring and homey, even if few homes can boast a chef as skilled as French-trained Brian Buckley. Succulent black pudding with onion sauce enriched with duck fat and lamb kidneys with mustard are almost always listed as starters, but Mr. Buckley's inventive grace notes include monkfish and prawns sparked with Thai curry sauce and pineapple or salmon with vermouth garnished with herby marinated tomatoes. Servings arrive on handsome old china, each elaborate pattern seemingly chosen to set off the preparation.   With supreme (if fleeting) disregard for American Heart Association guidelines, I tucked into a vast portion of salmon in pastry with rich caraway hollandaise and too soon found myself mopping the plate with the house soda bread.    Game is a delight at this time of year. Venison in a titillating raspberry vinegar and Dubonnet essence is generally offered, but Locks is a fine place to try less familiar widgeon (a small wild duck) or rare roasted tender young snipe or woodcock when they are available. My husband, Arthur, chose the rich game pie, an amalgam of hare, pigeon and pheasant, and found it wonderful.    \"Rich\" is an adjective that recurs when describing food at Locks. No stinting on butter and cream here.  Such sophisticated comfort food suits Dublin's damp northern climate. Visitors who are less self-indulgent will find alternatives, for example, smoked salmon and grilled black sole. Don't be put off by the term \"black sole\"; it's known as Dover sole on the other side of the Irish Sea. At Locks it is cooked to flaky perfection.   For dessert I chose the comparative austerity of fruit salad with flavorful blackberry sorbet but couldn't resist a spoonful of my husband's gooseberry fool, a lush blend of tart fruit and sweet cream.    The relatively short wine list reveals the manager Brian Cornish's penchant for things French. The dry Jurancon Domaine Cauhape '92 ($30.30) was a happy revelation, as was the 1984 Chateau Lynch-Bages ($65.60) that incited us to linger over a superb Stilton, chatting contentedly and enjoying the lilt of our neighbors' conversations.

Rumors of seizure of his assets set off a run on the bank, and panicky depositors withdrew $5 million in less than a week. And then in 1989, Ka Chiu Leung, a former president and chairman, was convicted of money laundering.    Years of neglect and mismanagement left the bank with problem real-estate loans and a string of quarterly losses.

Last week, in the first interview by a Syrian official with Israeli television, he said the people of Syria, like the people of Israel, wanted to reach a peace accord as soon as possible.

Jascha Horenstein is another case entirely, a conductor of marginal renown who has generated tremendous cult interest in the 21 years since his death. He lacked the long-term association with a big-name orchestra and record label that has elevated lesser musicians. But in the last few years his studio and live performances, with orchestras superior and inferior, in sound good and terrible, have proliferated on CD in astonishing numbers. We finally have an adequate record of one of the most vital, idiosyncratic interpreters of the 20th century.   Among other things, Horenstein was the greatest Mahler conductor of his generation, perhaps of any generation. His authority in Mahler was challenged only by Leonard Bernstein, and in some ways Horenstein brought his listeners closer to the heart of Mahler's music, rather than the heart of one conductor's experience of it. Performances of Mahler, and of Bruckner, have grown increasingly monumental and monotone in recent years; it is deeply satisfying to go back to Horenstein's flexible, full-voiced, superbly balanced readings, in which the texture is richly varied yet all of a piece. A missionary for these composers decades before they came into fashion, Horenstein never lost his youthful ardor and awe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"When Fate Is Calling The Tune","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/movies/film-view-when-fate-is-calling-the-tune.html","abstract":"  FATE PLAYED A STARRING ROLE AT THIS year's New York Film Festival, figuring prominently in a surprisingly large number of films on the schedule.

Beginning with \"Pulp Fiction,\" the thermodynamic miracle that is both the hottest and coolest film of the year, fate made its presence felt. The unusual chronology of Quentin Tarantino's film accentuates the way his characters' decisions can change their destinies, even as their futures are seen falling into place. Circular in structure, the movie closes with the image of a man who is fated to die -- earlier in the film, we have already seen his death occur -- because he has not understood how to save his own life.

It is coming to an end in quiet maturity. Indeed, in a recent series of Beethoven piano sonatas played on early instruments at Merkin Concert Hall, the greatest revelation was that there was none. At least in the eight sonatas I heard, Malcolm Bilson's stated ambition \"to open new paths of thought\" was only modestly fulfilled. Mr. Bilson, the godfather of the eight-concert, seven-pianist, four-piano series was, as usual, a consummate musician, playing with intelligence and verve, and some of the other pianists were insightful as well, but was anything established that we did not already know? Over the years, modern pianos have proved how inadequate their historical rivals are, and historical instruments have returned the insult. They are both correct.   We know, for example, that some of Beethoven's pedal markings can be executed only approximately on contemporary instruments and that his sharply etched dynamic changes can sound artificial on the modern Steinway. On the other hand, Russell Sherman's penetrating Beethoven performances heard recently at the Miller Theater on the campus of Columbia University and Richard Goode's ever-deepening Beethoven interpretations, to be presented in part later this month at Avery Fisher Hall, would be inconceivable on the lovely five-octave replica of a 1790 Anton Walter fortepiano used at Merkin Hall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"For Aristide's Followers, Every Step Is a Dance, Every Cheer a Song","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/world/mission-haiti-scene-for-aristide-s-followers-every-step-dance-every-cheer-song.html","abstract":"  At the moment of the Rev.

Augusto Pinochet of Chile to cling to power might give a false impression of his popularity.   I was on vacation in Chile for what happened to be the 21st anniversary of the general's infamous coup against the democratically elected Government of Salvador Allende in 1973. While it's true several thousand people (mostly military families) showed up at the military academy to celebrate the coup's anniversary, the sentiment of the rest of the populace was anything but hero worship.   The country was riveted that week by daily student demonstrations all over the country against General Pinochet. And on Sept. 11, the day of the anniversary, I witnessed a turnout of Chileans estimated at 20,000 (10 times as many as showed up at the military academy) march to the grave of Allende and to a monument for the thousands of victims of torture and murder under General Pinochet's 18-year rule as president.   The first few pages of Chile's major newspapers were given to covering the march to the cemetery, while the military academy gathering was buried in the back pages.   I spoke to dozens of ordinary Chileans, and it was hard to find anyone with anything positive to say about General Pinochet. The general's ability to remain as army commander seems not a result of popularity but perhaps attributable to the military's loyalty and to his ability to crush a government whose policies he disagrees with.   In this age in which human rights criminals are becoming less tolerated throughout the world, the presence of one of the 20th century's worst human rights abusers in a position of power appears to be a source of frustration to the majority of Chileans.

Not long ago, at the end of the 1980's, Public Enemy was the unquestioned vanguard of hip-hop for both its sonic and verbal pyrotechnics. Using layers of discordant funk riffs and compressed noise, the songs seemed loud at any volume. The sound itself suggested an insurrection, and the words, rebounding among boasts and polemics and slogans (\"Don't Believe the Hype,\" \"911 Is a Joke\"), harnessed rebelliousness to black-nationalist ideas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"Emotions at Play","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/sports/l-emotions-at-play-549240.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   Ira Berkow missed the point (\"Calloway O'ersteps the Line,\" The Times, Oct. 4).

It has its own language, similar to other Celtic tongues in its luxuriance of consonants and oddly placed apostrophes, but again, not exactly like any of them. And it has its own church architecture, the parish enclosure, which draws the many strands of Breton history and faith into an architectural ensemble unique to this province of France -- if that is appropriate terminology for local people who refer to Brittany and France as if they were neighboring countries.   That attitude may reflect the fact that over the centuries Brittany's ties with its neighbors across the Channel to the north were often as close as its ties with France to the east. In the early Christian era, the founding saints of many Breton towns came originally from Cornwall and Wales. During the French Revolution, French royalists exiled themselves in England, planning their return to Quiberon, where they hoped to join forces with Breton royalists and crush the revolt.. In our own time, thousands of British and French troops were evacuated from the Channel ports of Brittany just before the fall of France, and four years later, in August 1944, the Americans recaptured the Breton port of St.-Malo, extending the beachhead established against the Germans by the Allied landings in Normandy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"Big Apple Greeter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/travel/l-big-apple-greeter-500119.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: All of us at Big Apple Greeter read the Practical Traveler column \"Fewer Tours for the Disabled\" (July 31) with great interest, particularly since it says that travelers with disabilities are interested in mainstreaming and fewer are traveling in groups.

Avis said it would try to get the controls installed on less than eight hours' notice at 20 major locations and in less than 24 hours at most other corporate locations. Previously, 24 hours' notice was required to reserve a hand-controlled car.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"SOAPBOX;\nFear: It Cost a Boy's Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/nyregion/soapbox-fear-it-cost-a-boys-life.html","abstract":"ON the night of Sept. 27, in the Gowanus Houses in Brooklyn, a New York Housing Authority police officer shot and killed a 13-year-old boy who was holding a toy rifle.

The media picked up their comments, and Officer George was publicly called a trigger-happy cop, a baby killer. I'm told that one person was quoted as saying, \"Why are we paying these cops to kill our kids?\"\n\nI'm a housing cop and I have a passing acquaintance with Brian George, but I don't know what kind of officer he is.

The spare grayness of the room, the Friends Meeting House on Rutherford Place, somehow gave the word greater resonance. No stained glass, no choirs, no horseshoes of flowers for this saint, just a progression of people, the diversity that exists mostly in politicians' speeches, all the shades from pink to black, teen-agers, old people, mumblers and street slicks, tweed-and-turquoise people, polyester people, a few enraptured by their own eloquence and most just exhausted by their grief. Stephanie may well have been a saint, whatever that means. She never gave up on anyone who tried. She was 49 when she died on the first day of October.   I met Johnny Colon 17 years ago, but I don't remember when I first met Steph.
