One moment she was a Republican candidate for governor, seeking votes in the party's Sept. 13 primary. The next, she was Connecticut's Secretary of the State, encouraging people to register to vote, explaining how to do it, and sending an aide to bring registration forms from her office.   Mrs. Kezer, who was elected Secretary of the State in 1990, has also embraced a divided role in the race for her party's nomination. To the public, she offers herself as a good-government candidate, promising to \"return political power to the people.\" Within her party, however, she is attacking the record of the leadership's candidate, John Rowland, a former Congressman who nearly won the 1990 race and who has held large leads in polls this year. For that, she has been derided as the party's Tonya Harding -- a woman willing to hurt -- for the sake of her own ambitions -- the party's best chance to elect a governor in more than 20 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940903","headline":"The Right Kind of Vaccination Program","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/03/opinion/l-the-right-kind-of-vaccination-program-144738.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    The Clinton Administration's abandonment of a plan for a national warehouse as part of its Vaccines for Children program provides an opportunity to refocus attention on the real barriers to childhood immunization.

Thee Hypnotics differed from their British contemporaries, however, by also looking to the proto-heavy metal of the Stooges, a noisy late-1960's Detroit group led by Iggy Pop. Ray Hanson and Dave Bush kept their guitars wailing through the entire set, relying on psychedelic wah-wah effects to bolster Mr. Jones's moans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940903","headline":"Simpson Defense Attacks Theory of Single Assailant","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/03/us/simpson-defense-attacks-theory-of-single-assailant.html","abstract":"  Offering an early outline of their defense, lawyers for O.

I have sent quite a few,\" wrote Lieut. Joe Tom Meador in a letter to his parents dated June 17, 1945, two months after a collection of 10 priceless medieval church treasures disappeared from a closely guarded cave on the outskirts of Quedlinburg in central Germany. The Nazi Government had hidden them there for safekeeping during World War II.   \"There are two that I want to know about for sure,\" he continued. \"One is a box that contains a book, the cover of the book has a statue of Christ on it. By all means, if it gets home take extra good care of it. I have an idea that the cover is pure gold and the jewels on the cover are emeralds, jade and pearls. Don't ask me where I got it! But it could possibly be very very valuable.\"    Lieutenant Meador's identity as the Quedlinburg thief was disclosed by The New York Times in June 1990. Lawyers representing the Government of West Germany and the owner of the treasure, the cathedral called the Stiftskirche Domgemeinde Quedlinburg, promptly filed suit in Federal District Court in Dallas to recover the artworks. Letters Are Uncovered    In 1992, an out-of-court settlement between German officials and Lieutenant Meador's heirs led to the exhibition of the treasures at the Dallas Museum of Art that spring before they were returned to Germany. The next year they were exhibited before overflow crowds at the State Museum for Decorative Arts in Berlin, and last September they were finally returned to Quedlinburg.    The letters from the Quedlinburg thief to his family in Whitewright, Tex., a farm town 15 miles south of the Oklahoma border, were recently inspected by The New York Times.   They make clear that Lieutenant Meador, who studied art with his mother and taught art in the high school in New London, Tex., before entering the Army, recognized the unusual value of what he was stealing. When Lieutenant Meador's brother and sister were trying to sell the treasures after his death, they asserted that he had found them \"in the gutter\" and considered them of little value.   Current professional estimates of the value of the collection range from nearly $200 million to \"priceless.\"   The letters also demonstrate that the theft of the Quedlinburg treasures by Lieutenant Meador, who died of cancer in 1980, was not an isolated indiscretion by a war-weary soldier. He mentions having sent home two moving picture projectors, camera lenses, other optical instruments and clothing. Warning to Parents    Furthermore, he cautioned his parents not to show the treasures to anyone and later confessed that he had \"appropriated\" the artworks \"from a cave in the mountains.\"   The treasures had been kept for a millennium in the Schatzkammer, or treasure chamber, of the Quedlinburg cathedral. After Allied air attacks on Germany began, the treasures were moved to a cave outside of town.   Lieutenant Meador stole the treasures when his unit, the 87th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, was briefly stationed in Quedlinburg in the waning days of the fighting in Europe.   Apart from their physical beauty, the treasures have great historical importance to Germany because of their association with Heinrich I, a 10th-century Saxon ruler who united an early configuration of German-speaking states.   The most valuable item in the collection is the Samuhel Gospels, a sumptuously illustrated and illuminated ninth-century manuscript lettered with gold ink. It contains full-page paintings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the four Gospel scribes, which are among the earliest and best-preserved examples of early Western painting.   The other treasures include a gold, silver and ivory casket from the ninth or 10th century, a biblical manuscript dated 1513 and emblazoned with gold, silver and jewels; a liturgical ivory comb dating to the seventh or eighth century; five fancifully shaped reliquaries of cut rock crystal dating to the 10th century and a heart-shaped vessel believed to have been fashioned in the 15th century. The Loot Declines    In a letter to his parents dated July 7, 1945, Lieutenant Meador said the second medieval manuscript he had sent home was bound in solid gold covers encrusted with nearly 80 jewels. \"Please store it most carefully for me as it is very valuable,\" he stated.   A week later, he wrote that he had sent home \"a chest of the same type except the chest has a bunch of ivory inlay in it.\"   By Aug. 2, 1945, he was bemoaning the scarcity of easily available \"loot.\"   \"Now that the war is over it is harder to get things,\" he complained.   The next December, Lieutenant Meador was court-martialed and fined $600 for the theft of valuable silverware and gold-decorated china from the villa of the Marquise of St. Carlos in Biarritz, France. Although the Army investigated the theft of the Quedlinburg treasures after the war, they were not traced to Lieutenant Meador at that time.   In the out-of-court settlement in 1992, Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the siblings and heirs of Lieutenant Meador, received nearly $2.75 million from the German Government for relinquishing all claim to ownership of the artworks. The case has been investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, which, according to people close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity, is now demanding $30 million in back taxes, interest and penalties from the Meadors.   \"The I.R.S. is attempting to levy a tax and we expect to have to challenge it in tax court,\" Randal Mathis, the Dallas lawyer who represents the Meadors, said last week.   In a book about the case published in Germany last week, Willi A. Korte, a German investigator, says he has evidence that two of the treasures are still unlawfully in the United States and held by persons other than the heirs.   He says he has sworn statements from people in the Dallas area who have been able to describe or recognize photographs of artworks long missing from Quedlinburg. These include a rock crystal flask in the shape of a bishop's cap and a gold reliquary in the form of a crucifix.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940903","headline":"1944: Hitler to Speak : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/03/opinion/IHT-1944-hitler-to-speak-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] Adolf Hitler, reported by German diplomats to be planning a sensational speech Sunday [Sept. 3], probably will announce the crossing of the German frontier by General George S.

The Communist International directed by Stalin established the role that all the international brigades (including the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) would play in the foreign policy strategy of the Soviet Union. Basically this was to assume control of the Republican Government of Spain and to prevent any social revolution from occurring against the fascist forces of Franco. Behind the lines, the Communists and the brigades they controlled progressively took power away from the militant Socialists led by Largo Caballero; assassinated Andres Nin, the leftist leader associated with the P.O.U.M., a truly revolutionary Marxist party; fought against the anarchists and their union, the C.N.T.; and prevented the enactment of a program that promised land to the Spanish peasants and freedom from Spanish colonialism over the Riffs.

Situated about 60 miles south of Munich, Garmisch-Partenkirchen (the two towns were unified in 1935 in preparation for the 1936 Winter Olympics but still like to maintain their separate identities) lies in a deep valley beneath the Zugspitze, at 9,721 feet Germany's highest mountain. The surrounding foothills and mountains offer trails of every kind, from calm walks around blue alpine lakes to steep climbs up naked glaciers.    Mountain hiking is a German national pastime, some might even say obsession. In the years before the First World War, when going up into the mountains had a kind of cult status, hikers would make virtual pilgrimages to places like Garmisch-Partenkirchen. These days, the world of German mountain hiking and its rites has as much to do with material pleasures, like wearing a fashionable brand of hiking boots, as spiritual ones. A broad cross-section of Germans goes up in the mountains, from kindergarteners to pensioners, with most taking it all very seriously, like Americans who play softball to win. This, along with the vast network of trails, can be daunting if you are a beginner. But once you have chosen a trail, just follow the signposts -- which were more of a help to me during my visit in July than any of the maps I tried using -- and don't worry about not keeping up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"HOME CLINIC;\nSpecial Care Is Needed To Repair Broken Glass","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/nyregion/home-clinic-special-care-is-needed-to-repair-broken-glass.html","abstract":"REPLACING a broken window pane is not difficult, but it does require care to avoid injury. \n\nStart by removing the broken glass.

A month ago, The City surveyed Manhattan, interviewing dozens of residents, merchants, police officers and district managers of community boards to seek examples of quality of life issues. A journey through Queens reveals similar psychic desires, for order, cleanliness and a nonviolent environment. But the decidedly unscientific survey shows some different emphases, in some cases reflecting immigration -- overcrowded houses, and auto shops turning up on residential blocks. In addition, livery cabs triple-parked outside their bases are grating nerves. Illegal dumping is prevalent.  East Queens, partly suburban, has beefs, but the west can list more. Soon, The City will look at Brooklyn and The Bronx. ASTORIA HEIGHTS, ASTORIA LONG ISLAND CITY 1. AIRPLANE NOISE Especially heavy in bad weather when incoming-flight path over Astoria Heights is used more. 2. NOISE Comes from heavy traffic from trucks headed to Triborough Bridge. 3.

PROSTITUTION Streetwalkers congregate in the area around Jackson Avenue and 23d Street. 10-12. ILLEGAL DUMPING In July, a trailer was found with tons of rancid meat at (10) 48th Street and Barnett Avenue.

WINDOW WASHERS A persistent problem at 31st Street and Bridge Plaza North and South, although enforcement efforts are thinning the ranks. 14. NOISE Loiterers play loud radios at 43d Avenue and 43d Street. 15. EYESORES At Greenpoint Avenue near Queens Boulevard merchants display their wares too far into the sidewalk. Some residents complain about flashy signs on the street and banners hung across the avenue.   16. LIVERY CABS At Jackson Avenue and 23d Street, livery cabs double- and triple-park.   17. CRIME Residents of the Queensbridge Houses, a project, complain of drug sales, periodic gunshots and loitering. JACKSON HEIGHTS, WOODSIDE, SUNNYSIDE, CORONA, ELMHURST 18. AUTO THEFTS AND BREAK-INS Quiet, tree-lined streets between Northern Boulevard and 37th Avenue are a hunting ground for thieves. 19.

PROSTITUTION Brothels above commercial establishments are prevalent along Roosevelt Avenue in the 80's and 90's. 26. STOLEN TRASH BASKETS A big problem around Roosevelt Avenue and 61st Street where heavier pedestrian traffic over the years has meant more litter. \"Even if we put them chained to a pole they disappear,\" says Dolores Rosado, district manager of Community Board 2. 27. DRUGS Street sales are a continuing problem, especially around 64th Street and Broadway. 28. DRUGS Outdoor and indoor drug sales are prevelant. A major outdoor spot is at 105th and 106th Streets and Northern Boulevard. Police say livery cabs are being used to pickup and deliver drugs. 29.

ILLEGAL DUMPING Mattresses and other trash are dumped regularly at Bell Boulevard and the Grand Central Parkway (43) and along the Long Island Expressway. (44) 45. ILLEGAL DUMPING Vacant lots and industrial strips are a prime ground for dumpers. 46. AIRPLANE NOISE Source: La Guardia. 47. AIRPLANE NOISE Source: La Guardia 48. AUTO THEFT Big problem due in part, to the proximity to major highways which offer thieves easy flight. 49. CROWDING St. John's University and Queens College create needs for student housing, which is often met by illegal basement apartments. Puts drain on services. 50. NOISE Motorcycles roar through quiet, winding streets. SOUTHWEST QUEENS 51. CROWDING Many families crowd into one and two-family houses. 52.

That afternoon, beneath brightening skies, past immense crowds, a vast funeral procession followed in coffin to Glanevin Cemetery.\n\n Dublin, as Robert Kee remarks in \"The Laurel and the Ivy,\" \"had long raised public funerals to the level of an art form.\" Parnell's loyal followers designed this one to express grief, anger and definance. \"Died fighting for Ireland,\" read the legend on one wreath. For a dozen years he had towered over Irish life, but in the year before his death his power and much of his glamour had been smothered in what Timothy Healy -- at first a member of his party but then the most savage and scurrilous of his enemies -- called \"The stench of the divorce court.\" In the months that remained to him, he had fought a fierce, losing battle to retain control of the party he had created, one that had transformed Irish political life.\n\n Long afterward, the grave was to be marked by a massive boulder of Wicklow granite, bearing the single and sufficient word \"Parnell.\" Surrounded by the gimcrack baroque of Victorian mortuary art, it carried its own significance -- stern and incantatory. Parnell had passed into mythology, a complex and potent legend. In Joyce's horrifying Christmas dinner scene in \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\" set in the immediate aftermath of the death, Aunt Dante, Roman Catholic and puritan, screams out: \"Devil out of hell! We won! We crushed him to death! Fiend!\" But Mr. Casey, who might have walked behind the coffin, sobs: \"Poor Parnell! My dead king.\"\n\n Parnell entered the London Parliament in 1875 as neither Liberal nor Tory, but rather as a member of the small Home Rule Party, dedicated to the quixotic task of persuading England, by logic and oratory, to grant Ireland a limited measure of self-government. He seemed a merely social acquisition, a handsome and aristocratic young Protestant landlord whose previous interests had been limited to cricket, geology and fox hunting. But he displayed an icy self-control, an indifference to English opinion and disdain for a Parliament which he came to manipulate with a combination of shrewdness and audacity. Irishmen in Parliament were expected to be jocose, expansive, orotund. Parnell's accent was that of Cambridge University, and his manner remote and faintly taunting. Michael Davitt, the peasant-born rebel who was first his ally and then, after the divorce scandal, his opponent, was to call him \"An Englishman of the strongest type, molded for an Irish purpose.\"\n\n Within three years, he had moved to the head of his small party, and had earned the bitter anger of Liberals and Tories alike. But his parliamentary stance was never an end in itself. It was addressed across the water to his true audience, the Irish. \"England,\" he wrote to a Dublin newspaper, \"respects nothing but power.\" As he told a crowd of thousands in Dublin: \"I care nothing for this English Parliament and its outcries. I care nothing for its existence, if that existence is to continue a source of tyranny and destruction to my country.\"\n\n Irish history had been awaiting its Parnell. Thirty years before, famine had devastated the land, revealing its hopeless dependence upon forces beyond itself -- whether those of nature, an inscrutable Providence, or a British Government that had shamefully mismanaged famine relief. The armed Fenian insurrection of 1867 had been a ludicrous failure, although its rebellious tradition remained alive. So too did the far older tradition of scattered agrarian terrorism as a weapon against iniquitously high rents and eviction. Since the great famine, America held millions of Irish immigrants ready to provide, from a safe distance, the financial sinews of resistance. But Ireland was a land lacking in political and social coherence. It was Parnell's genius, or else his good fortune, to draw together these scattered energies and aspirations.\n\n In 1879, a crop failure and fear of a new famine, coupled with a wave of evictions, led to the foundation of a Land League committed to reform by all means short of violence. But at times it came very close to violence. Michael Davitt, a Fenian rebel released from prison in part through Parnell's efforts, was its chief organizer, but Parnell made common cause with it. Its most memorable moments were his. \"You must show the landlords,\" he told a Mayo crowd, \"that you intend to keep a firm grip of your homesteads and lands. You must not allow yourselves to be dispossessed as you were dispossessed in 1847.\" He was referring, of course, to the great famine, and in speech after speech, he linked the causes of land and nationality.\n\n By the spring of 1882, charges of Land League conspiracy had landed him in Kilmainham prison, never an inconvenient address for an Irish patriot. From there, bargaining almost as an equal with Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, he negotiated a \"treaty\" that partly solved the land question and also hinted at a very tentative alliance with the Liberals. By 1885, thanks to a greatly expanded franchise, he was able to bring to Parliament an Irish party of 86, all of them oath-bound to vote as a party, which meant, in practice, at his bidding. By 1889, Parnell's star fully in the ascendant, Gladstone, then in opposition, pledged a reluctant Liberal Party to support Irish Home Rule.\n\n Just then, disaster struck. Capt. Wi8lliam O'Shea, an Irish political opportunist, filed for divorce from his English wife, Katharine, naming Parnell as co-respondent. It was an affair of long standing. During the Kilmainham negotiations, when O'Shea was carrying messages between the prison and Downing Street, Katharine bore Parnell the first of his three children.\n\n O'Shea might have stepped out of one of Feydeau's Paris hotel room farces, complete with monocle, waxed mustaches and roguish ways. Panderer, liar, blackmailer, boaster, he lacked any redeeming trait, other than a fondness for such of his children as he had reason to believe might be his. (He writes of them cloyingly, in his letters to Katharine, as his \"chicks.\" Parnell wrote to her as to his \"Wifie\" and his \"Queenie.\" The epistolary style in her little circle was not an elevated one.)\n\n That anyone as wary and shrewd as Parnell would place himself in the power of a Captain O'Shea is surely evidence of the mysterious powers of romantic love. A dangerous love: in 1886, O'Shea compelled Parnell to foist him upon the disgusted voters of Galway, and in so blantant a manner that it should have placed on warning everyone except Parnellites suffering from terminal idolatry.\n\n Robert Kee's elaborate re-creation of the domestic drama is one of his strengths. An Irish journalist and popular historian, and the author of \"The Green Flag,\" a history of Irish nationalism, he writes intelligently and shrewdly about politics and makes good use of primary and secondary material. His use of previously undiscussed newspaper material is superb. But the political and social story has been told before: by F.S.L. Lyons in his biography of Parnell, by Conor Cruise O'Brien on the organization of Parnell's party, by Roy Foster on the Wicklow squirearchy in which he grew up, by Emmet Larkin in \"The Roman Catholic Church and the Fall of Parnell, 1888-1891\" and, most recenlty, by Frank Callanan in \"The Parnell Split, 1890-91.\"\n\n Mr. Kee's account of the other half of Parnell's life, hidden and then forced into lurid light, is matchless, and makes adroit use of Katharine's own \"Charles Stewart Parnell: His Love Story and Political Life\" (1914). That is an essential but understandably bizarre book: her need to make all parties to the triangle seem respectable placed a heavy burden on her slender rhetorical skills.\n\n Katharine (she was never, save by Parnell's jeering enemies, called Kitty) is less easily brought into focus than is her egregious husband. The O'Sheas seem at first to have been two of a kind, courting Parnell for such favors as might come their way, but she came to respond fully to Parnell's deep love for her.\n\n When the scandal broke, Parnell gave vague assurances to his followers that he had not acted \"dishonorably\" -- meaning that the O'Shea marriage had long ago broken down. This was not a view of monogamy likely to recommend itself to Irish Catholics or to those English Nonconformists upon whose support Gladstone relied. The divorce, accompanied by the usual messy evidence, was granted on Nov. 17, 1890, and on the 25th Gladstone made public a letter in which he warned that Parnell's continued leadership would make home rule impossible for many years. Parnell, following his central strategy, issued a \"Manifesto\" addressed to \"the people of Ireland,\" in which he denounced English interference in Irish affairs (soon he would be calling Gladstone \"The grand old spider\") and made clear his intention to retain power. In early December, the Irish party met for five days in Committee Room 15 of the House of Commons in London, and the name of that room would have a baleful existence in Irish history and echo in Joyce's fiction.\n\n The fierce quarrels in the room were a foretaste of what was to come -- Parnell by turns icy and maddened, Tim Healy vicious an dlethal. \"And who is to be mistress of the party?\" Healy asked. The party split, leaving Parnell with a rump, and that split, as Connor Cruise O'Brien has written, \"is the most traumatic episode in the span of Irish history that lies between the Great Famine and the Easter Rising of 1916.\"\n\n Parnell was able to rally the Fenian rebels, devotees by now of lost causes, but the Catholic Church was against him, and so was middle-calss opinion. In the months that remained to him, he fought and lost three by elections, traveling back and forth between Irish country towns and his English house in Brighton, which he shared with Katharine, now Mrs. Parenll. The insults hurled at him were ugly, and with each defeat his decline became more evident.\n\n His final, mythic image harded in these months -- solitary, unyielding. It was a complex legacy to his people. For yeats, an image of aristocratic pride (\"For Parnell was a proud man, No pouder trod the ground\"). For Joyce, proof that prudish respectability, political scheming and a bullying church would always be arrayed against the heroic. For the rebels of the 1916 Rising, a link with an earlier and nobler Ireland. His political skills in triumph and his superb fighting temperament in defeat had given his people a figure through whom they could seize self-respect in the face of imperial condescension.\n\n I have read somewhere that Captain O'Shea, in his later years, became a crony of Major Count Walsin-Esterhazy, the actual traitor for whose crime Dreyfus was sent ot Devil's Island. Two of a kind.\n\n And Tim Healy? The 1916 Rising eventually made possible for Ireland the self-government for which Parnell had fought -- a Free State. Tim Healy became its Governor General, representing the British crown.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Would East River Festival Last Long in Central Park?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/nyregion/l-would-east-river-festival-last-long-in-central-park-182001.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I am writing about the Aug. 21 puff piece, \"A Taste of San Juan on the East River,\" regarding the festival held Sundays in East River Park.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Yonkers Officials Argue Over How Strong a 'Strong Mayor' Should Be","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/nyregion/yonkers-officials-argue-over-how-strong-a-strong-mayor-should-be.html","abstract":"  Five years after Yonkers voters decided to replace their city manager with a \"strong mayor,\" political leaders here are having second thoughts.

The collector-car market has been particularly hard hit in the last few years. Prices had become overheated in the 1980's, driven up by speculators, and once the recession took hold the market deflated.    Amid the relatively good buys, which are the best of the good?    Mr. Brownell, the editor of special Interest Autos magazine and Hemmings Motor News, a monthly compendium of ads for old cars, parts and services for collectors, has chosen some \"sleepers\" that could prove to be solid investments while providing some fun in the meantime.    Here are Mr. Borwnell's selections and comments:    1961-67 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible -- \"Impeccably understated styling, constructed to nearly Rolls-Royce standards. Current asking prices range from around $2,000 for shaggy unrestored cars to about $17,000 for show-ready restorations. Buy the best one your budget allows because they are very complex and therefore expensive cars to restore.\"    1968-70 Dodge Charger R/T -- \"A muscle car with some luxurious touches, as opposed to stripped-down corporate cousins like the Plymouth Road Runner.\" A partly restored '68 was offered in a recent Hemmings ad for $3,500, while on the same page a \"recently restored\" rust-free car from California, had an asking price of $8,000.    1961-73 Volvo P1800, 1800S, 1800E and 1800ES -- \"Built mainly for style rather than speed, these handsome coupes and sport wagons were Volvo's flagship in the United States for a dozen years.\" Early models are somewhat underpowered and badly susceptible to rust, he said, and the 2-liter 1800E is known for fuel-injection problems. Prices range from $4,500 to $11,500 depending on condition.    1973 Corvette L-48 -- \"Offers impressive performance even when measured against today's cars. The big difference is that a good '73 L-48 convertible will cost about one-fifth the sticker of a new Vette drop-top.\" Cars with removable 'T-tops\" cost even less than the convertibles. The average asking price for a ready-to-drive L-48 is about $12,000.    1969-73 Porsche 911T -- \"These attractive coupes seem like a giveaway at around $10,000 for excellent examples. To be fair, the 911T is hardly perfect. Older Porsches are no stranger to rust, sometimes chronically so, and such cars should be strictly avoided because they cost the earth to restore.    Every year for the last 10 years, Mr. Cole, a partner in the World Classic Auction and Exposition Company in Danville, Calif., has published his 'Gold List\" of cars that he expects to appreciate significantly in the next five years. Here are his recent selections:    1972-74 BMW 3.0 CS Coupe -- Current value: $8,000 to $14,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.    1940's woodie sedans and wagons -- Current value: $22,500 to $27,500. Five-year projection: up to $35,000.    1951-62 Mercedes-Benz 300 sedan -- Current value: $8,000 to $15,000. Five-year projection: up to $30,000.    1955-62 MGA 1500 and 1600 roadster -- Current value $8,000 to $12,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.    1950--51 Mercury Monterey coupe -- Current value: $8,000 to $12,000. Five-year projection: up to $20,000.    1961-67 Chevrolet Impala and Impala SS convertibles -- Current value: $10,000 to $15,000. Five-year projection: up to $35,000.    1963-65 Alfa Romeo Giulie, Spider and Spider Veloce -- Current value: $13,000 to $16,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.    1956-67 Volkswagen microbus -- Current value: $1,000 to $8,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.    1969-71 Jaguar XKE roadster -- in average condition (to be driven rather than displayed at car shows). Current value: $18,000 to $25,000.

Attacking the effect of political correctness on discussions of African-American art, for example, Mr. Lucie-Smith writes: \"One purpose of this constantly shifting terminology seems to be the exclusion of generalist critics such as myself, who readily fall into some newly dug linguistic pit and can then be dismissed as racists.\" Apparently intending to hold the ground of esthetic value against the intrusion of recent writing on issues of race and sexuality in the visual arts, the author, an English critic and curator, adopts a position antagonistic to these categories and to the political debates underlying them. For example, Mr. Lucie-Smith chides feminist artwork for a lack of eroticism, asserting, in a generalization typical of this book, \"The female sensibility seems less preoccupied with eroticism than with the problem of difference.\" The chapter on \"Minority Sexuality\" praises the work of some gay male artists for its uninhibited eroticism but dismisses more political work: \"Gay art, like art which protests against racial discrimination, is now something which contrives to put itself beyond the reach of criticism because it is essentially an art of victims.\" \"Race, Sex, and Gender in Contemporary Art\" combines an appreciation of estheticized eroticism with a blunt critique of feminism, multiculturalism and political art.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Inadequate U.N.

A.F.C. EAST BUFFALO BILLS 1993: Finished 12-4. Lost, 30-13, to Dallas in the SuperBowl STRENGTHS: A high-energy, experienced offense with talent at all the skill positions. Running back Thurman Thomas is still the most versatile running back in the league. And Bruce Smith is still one of the most respected pass rushers. WEAKNESSES: Quarterback Jim Kelly is battling tendinitis in his throwing shoulder. He's been beaten up in the last four years and has weathered most of it. Tackle Howard (House) Ballard went to Seattle as a free agent. His replacement, Jerry Crafts at 6-6, 351 pounds, is as big as a luxury liner, but is inexperienced. OUTLOOK: The Bills are confident that they can make it back to another Super Bowl. They said the same thing last year. And the year before that, and the year before that . . . Take them seriously. MIAMI DOLPHINS 1993: Finished 9-7. STRENGHTS: The secondary is strong with cornerback Troy Vincent, returning from a knee injury, and the free-agent acquisitions of cornerback Tyrone Braxton and safety Gene Atkins. WEAKNESSES: The rushing attack isn't going to send shivers through anyone. Running back Terry Kirby was a pleasant surprise as a rookie last year. But they need more from him, Keith Byars and Mark Higgs to have a decent threat in the rushing department. OUTLOOK: Everyone wants to see how quarterback Dan Marino returns from the torn Achilles' tendon that sidelined him for most of last season. If Marino returns to form, the Dolphins stand a good shot at Making the Super Bowl. INDIANAPOLIS COSTS 1993: Finished 4-12. STRENGTHS: The linebacking corps has a mixture of youth and experience and is the cornerstone of the defense. Watch Tony Bennett, a free agent from Green Bay, as a pass rusher. First-round pick Marshall Faulk has put some teeth in the rushing attack. WEAKNESSES: It's fair to say that Jim Harbaugh doesn't have the gun that Jeff George had at quarterback. The problem for Harbaugh is no one is sure what type of quarterback he is after being browbeaten for most of his seven years in Chicago. We'll soon find out. OUTLOOK: If Faulk can take some of the pressure off Harbaugh, like Thurman Thomas does from Jim Kelly in Buffalo, then the Colts can do some things. How much can they get accomplished? Who knows. But as long as Faulk is in the mix, it should be fun to watch. NEW YORK JETS: 1993: Finished 8-8. STRENGHTS: The offense could be a powerhouse. Running back Johnny Johnson and tight end Johnny Mitchell are gamebreakers. Receiver Rob Moore is developing into a big-play man. Linebacker Mo Lewis might be the most underrated player at his position in the league. WEAKNESSES: Rookie cornerback Aaron Glenn, who will start opposite veteran James Hasty in the secondary, could be liability because of his lack of experience. The Jets still don't have a dominant pass rusher on the defensive line. OUTLOOK: For the Jets to make a run at the playoffs two players must stay healthy and have Pro Bowl-caliber years -- quarterbck Boomer Esiason and defensive end Jeff Lageman. NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: 1993: Finished 5-11. STRENGTHS: Running back Marion Butts could be the switch that turns on the lights for the Patriots' offense and take pressure off second-year quarterback Drew Bledsoe. The secondary won't be pushovers now that cornerback Ricky Reynolds and safety Myron Guyton have been added. WEAKNESSES: The Patriots' defense finished No. 22 against the run last season, which bothered Coach Bill Parcells to no end. Perhaps one of those monster linebackers, Vincent Brown and Willie McGinest, can plug up those holes. OUTLOOK: The only thing standing in the Patriots' way of being a consistent winner is time. They're a fairly young team that needs time to build experience and confidence. They'll be better than 5-11 this year. A.F.C. CENTRAL HOUSTON OILERS 1993: Finished 12-4. STRENGTHS: The offensive line remains strong, anchored by veteran center Bruce Matthews. The secondary is also tough with safety Bubba McDowell and cornerback Cris Dishman. Running back Gary Brown was a splendid surprise last year rushing for 1,002 yards in just eight games. WEAKNESSES: The Oilers took a big hit in the pass-rush department with the departures of defensive ends William Fuller and Sean Jones. That kind of talent depletion isn't easily filled. OUTLOOK: Quarterback Cody Carison was a very capable backup to Warren Moon. Now, Carlson is the starter. There's a big difference. Moon had run that offense for 10 years. Carlson knows it, but how well can he run it week in and week out? PITTSBURGH STEELERS 1993: Finished 9-7. STRENGHTS: Barry Foster is a big-time running back who is used to carrying the load. A pair of Pro Bowlers, linebacker Greg Lloyd and cornerback Rod Woodson, give Pittsburgh one of the fastest defenses in the league. WEAKNESSES: The receiving corps doesn't give defenses nearly as many headaches as it should. They're hoping first-round pick Charles Johnson can rectify that situation. OUTLOOK: When Foster went down with an ankle injury last year so did the Steelers' offense. They need Foster healthy if they're going to have a chance at making the playoffs. CLEVELAND BROWNS 1993: Finished 7-9. STRENGTHS: The Browns ranked No. 12 in defense in the league last year and a big part of that was tackle Michael Dean Perry. Safety Eric Turner, who had five interceptions last year, should help the defense. WEAKNESSES: Whether it's Vinny Testaverde or Mark Rypien at quarterback, it doesn't matter. The Browns aren't going to get any sparks from the position. OUTLOOK: The Browns have always promised to find a role for mighty mile running back Eric Metcalf. They're promising again this year to make him a prominent part of the offense. That would be an entertaining diversion from another possible quarterback controversy. CINCINNATI BENGALS 1993: Finished 3-13. STRENGTHS: A defense that can boast six No. 1 picks, including this year's numero uno, Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson. With Wilkinson and Danny Copeland, a first-rounder in 1993, at the tackles, the Bengals have the makings of one of the most dominant defensive fronts in the league. WEAKNESSES: The offense finished 27th in the league last year and the same group returns intact. The offensive line is porous. Quarterback David Klinger is still stumbling around in the dark. Running back Harold Green is a bright spot. But how much can one man do? OUTLOOK: Last year, General Manager Mike Brown called his team \"The gang that couldn't shoot straight.\" The same can still be said of the offense, but the defense can draw a bead and knock out anyone. Unfortunately for Cincinnati, it takes three units to make a whole team. A.F.C. WEST LOS ANGELES RAIDERS 1993: Finished 10-6. STRENGTHS: A corps of receivers that could qualify for the Olympic sprint relay team. The defense has some emerging stars in linemen Chester McGlockton, Anthony Smith and Nolan Harrison. The secondary is solid with cornerbacks Terry McDaniel and Lionel Washington and safety Eddie Anderson. WEAKNESSES: The lack of a rushing attack kept them from beating the Bills at Buffalo in the playoffs last year. The Raiders have added Harvey Williams from Kansas City as a way of beefing up the deficiency. Ty Montgomery will start at halfback and Napoleon McCallum is the fullback. OUTLOOK: The Black and Silver won't have many occasions to be black and blue this year, because they'll be the ones handing out the licks. With the speed they have they should run right past a lot of teams. The key will be whether quarterback Jeff Hostetler will be able to find those fleet-footed receivers. DENVER BRONCOS 1993: Finished 9-7. STRENGTHS: The offense took a giant step forward with the addition of speedy receivers Anthony Miller and Mike Pritchard. They're joining quarterback John Elway, running back Rod Bernstine and tight end Shannon Sharpe, who had 81 receptions last year. WEAKNESSES: The defense finished 19th in the league last year and lost cornerback Tyrone Braxton. Free safety Steve Atwater can only do so much. Free agents Ray Crockett and Ben Smith will start at the corners. OUTLOOK: The only thing that can stand in the Broncos' way this year is their defense. If it can hold their own, the offense will stand tall. With Miller and Pritchard as targets, Elway could be in for another big year in terms of numbers. But he'd rather have a shot at a Super Bowl championship and the Bronocs have a fighting chance. KANSAS CHIEFS 1993: Finished 11-5. STRENGTHS: The defensive front seven, which includes linebacker Derrick Thomas, defensive end Neil Smith and tackles Joe Phillips and Dan Saleaumua, is one of the toughest. Quarterback Joe Montana is 38 years old, but when he's healthy and on, he's still one of the best. WEAKNESSES: Greg Hill, the first-round pick, is going to be asked to handle the rushing load, because as good as Marcus Allen is he's not you enough to carry the ball 200 times a season. OUTLOOK: Quarterback Steve Bono was one of the smartest moves the Chiefs could have made. ONe good lick, like the one that knocked him 9out of the A.F.C. championship game at Buffalo last season, and Montana is on the shelf for a while. Bono knows the offense and can run it. The Chiefs are going to be in the thick of the playoff race. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 1993: Finished 6-10. STRENGTHS: Defensively, the Seahawks can display some of the best players in the league at their positions. Defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy and linebacker Rufus Porter are great pass rushers and safety Eugene Robinson is a big hitter. Quarterback Rick Mirer is beginning to emerge and running back Chris Warren has put together back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons. WEAKNESSES: Receiver Brian Blades, who had 80 catches and three touchdowns last year, needs a counterbalance. The Seahawks acquired tackle Howard Ballard to shore up their offensive line, but they lost tackle Andy Heck. OUTLOOK: The Seahawks are a mystery team. They have a collection of fine, young players, but they don't seem to be able to get it together to build a consistent winner. With Kennedy and Mirer, the Seahawks have the cornerstones for success. But the team remains an undeveloped project. SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 1993: Finished 8-8. STRENGTHS: Defensive linemen Leslie O'Neal and Chris Mims give the Chargers defense its bark and linebacker Junior Seau gives it the bit. Natrone Means was a pleasant surprise as a rookie, rushing for 645 yards. WEAKNESSES: The offense has been depleted of explosiveness by the departure of running back Marion Butts and receiver Anthony Miller. Quarterback Stan Humphries is workmanlike and gets the job done, but with fewer weapons to work with he's going to have to work magic this year. OUTLOOK: The chargers aren't nearly as good as they were two years ago when they won the A.F.C. West. They're also a much different team with the loss of Rod Bernstine, John Friesz, Butts and Miller. They'll have a difficult time getting anywhere in this division, especially with the Raiders, Chiefs and the Broncos sitting on top of them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Sports of The Times; Quarterback Controversies In the Wings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/sports/sports-of-the-times-quarterback-controversies-in-the-wings.html","abstract":"  UNTIL now, both the Giants and the Jets have been able to hide the possibility of the dreaded quarterback controversy under the surface of semantics.

It is a legal monopoly that permits most cities to have only one representative team. Moreover, there are significant barriers to entry that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a new major league baseball league to be introduced and remain financially viable. Thus, players can command exorbitant salaries, which are directly passed on by the growing number of games on pay television. So far, at least, there are enough fans willing to pay the prices to support the continued escalation of player salaries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"A Triumph of Faith, and Just in Time","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/nyregion/a-triumph-of-faith-and-just-in-time.html","abstract":"  The Jewish New Year has long been known as the Season of Renewal, but recent events at Congregation Derech Emunoh, the landmark synagogue of the Rockaways, have infused the term with vivid new meaning.

His musical merits include an unabashed Romanticism underpinned by firm Classical forms; a wonderful ear for instrumental combinations; a deft sense of text-setting, and a melodic gift rare in this century of angular, abrasive modernism.   But that prevalent modernism also explains why it took Barber's music so long to gain currency in record stores. Barber was born in 1910. The golden boy of American composition in his youth, he withdrew into an increasingly reclusive maturity. His \"Hermit Songs,\" set to texts of medieval Irish monks and first performed in 1953, clearly reflected his own feelings of sweet, sad isolation. And this was long before the critical and public rejection of his opera \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" commissioned for the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House in 1966.

And the list of involuntary retirees strings out to include such venerable National Football League names as Karl Mecklenburg, Neal Anderson, Charles Mann, Dennis Smith, Bill Fralic, et al.\n\nBut the real damage from the salary cap is the loss of continuity for pro teams. The N.F.L. Players Association, in its rush to free agency, ceded the owners a $34.5 million ceiling on annual salaries and touched off the greatest migration of bodies since the Potato Famine in Ireland.\n\nThis fall, induced by worry about fitting them under the cap, the Giants alone let cornerback Mark Collins slip off to the Chiefs, center Brad Oates to the 49ers, safety Greg Jackson to the Eagles, offensive lineman Eric Moore to the Bengals, running back Lewis Tillman to the Bears and safety Myron Guyton and guard Bob Kratch to the Patriots.\nWhy It Was Popular\n\n I'm reminded of a conversation I had with Y. A. Tittle back in the early 1960's, a generation ago, when pro football sprang upon the land as the most physical and emotional of all team sport exercises, rushing past the college game as the preeminent fall spectacle and even challenging baseball as the national pastime.\n\n\"Let me tell you what made the pros catch on,\" confided Tittle, the bald Giants quarterback who had become the folksy delight of Manhattan after being acquired from the 49ers for a forgettable lineman named Lou Cordileone. Parenthetically, he was wondering if he could ask the Giants to pay him $25,000 a year.\n\n\"The little old lady from Scarsdale buys a season ticket in the mezzanine, and every Sunday when she comes to watch us play, she knows that Jimmy Patton, No. 20, is going to be back there at safety on defense. And when we got the ball, that's Del Shofner slanting over the middle to catch a pass on a post pattern.\n\n\"In college they're gone after three seasons. But year after year, that little old lady sees the same players out there, memorizes all their numbers, has learned what their responsibilities are and identifies with them. If the other team completes a long one down the right sideline, she knows that Erich Barnes let the guy get behind him. No one has to tell her.\"\n\nThat type of familiarity with the teams and their rosters became the cornerstone of pro football popularity and bred a knowledge and loyalty that pervaded the crowds filling the stadiums.\nWholesale Turnover\n\n That stability no longer exists. True, even back then, the aging process and injuries inevitably brought changes on a team, but they were generally subtle, not the wholesale turnover you see now. The premier stars chase the big bucks (Reggie White to the Packers, Seth Joyner to the Cardinals, Ken Norton to the 49ers) and the owners discard established players who can still contribute but have attained a salary level of half a million dollars or more that makes it impractical to keep them on the roster.\n\nBaseball has been pursuing a salary cap to level the playing field for its small and large markets, which have disparate income from radio and television, but that argument doesn't pertain to pro football. The N.F.L. television package, the main income source, makes revenue sharing a fait accompli. Football owners want the salary cap to save them from themselves.\n\nStupendous contracts, such as those given Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys, consume the megabucks of the money allotted under the salary cap while little effort is made to retain other icons who have spent a decade and more with the same team.\n\nI'm referring to such as Clay Matthews, who spent 16 years with the Browns; Rickey Jackson, 13 years with the Saints; Albert Lewis, 11 years with the Chiefs. They'll be playing out their careers with other teams this fall.\nWhy Him for Him?\n\n Sometimes, the transitions make little sense. The Raiders dismissed Steve Smith, a veteran fullback, because he was making a million a year. Instead, they picked up Tom Rathman, deemed expendable by the 49ers because his salary was too high. Meanwhile, Smith caught on with Seattle because the Seahawks didn't retain high-priced John L. Williams, a consistent back for a decade. And Williams signed with the Steelers, who needed a fullback when Merril Hoge opted for the Chicago Bears (who scrapped Iron Head Heyward, since picked up by Atlanta).\n\nThis ring-arond-the-rosey of interchangeable fullbacks served to reduce their salaries, collectively. But it disregarded the unique chemistry that goes into the composition of a football team and the mutual reliance built over time -- Steve Young knowing exactly where Rathman was going to be on each play, and Rathman bailing him out as Young scrambled.\n\nBesides which, that little old lady up in the stands, who has studiously followed the home team all these years, now has her player numbers all scrambled.\n\n\nMurray Olderman, a former syndicated columnist, has written five books about professional football.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Reducing Water Usage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/realestate/your-home-reducing-water-usage.html","abstract":"  THE right to an abundance of domestic water at little cost is something Americans have traditionally taken for granted, like free speech.

However, except for a new introduction, I have decided to keep the text of \"World Within World\" exactly as it was in 1950.\n\nThe occasion for a surge of interest in \"World Within World,\" particularly in the United States, is that last year a young American writer, David Leavitt, published a novel, \"While England Sleeps,\" closely derived in plot and text from about 30 pages of my autobiography, concerning my relationship with a man I call Jimmy Younger.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"County Mandates Safety Measures For Cash Machines","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/nyregion/county-mandates-safety-measures-for-cash-machines.html","abstract":"A RACK with bank literature in a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank on Mamaroneck Avenue here holds a pamphlet that warns depositors, with almost one-inch headline type, \"Don't Flash Your Cash!\"\n\nIn smaller print it further cautions them, \"Before you leave an A.T.M. put your money and card away.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Harvesting Art, History and an Ear of Corn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/nyregion/playing-neighborhood-madison-square-park-harvesting-art-history-ear-corn.html","abstract":"  WHY go to the country to see a corn patch when there's one waiting for you in Madison Square Park?

Yet beneath this crush of ephemera, the Open is really about the basics of the game -- a ball, a racquet, the score. The people who see that all this runs smoothly -- that the server will always have a ball, that a favorite racquet will always be well strung, that everyone will know the score -- work in the realm of the always seen but rarely contemplated. Now, pay attention. Think Players Are High-Strung? Check Their Racquets.     PETE SAMPRAS, the world's No. 1-ranked player, walked to the back of the players' lounge the other day, handed Roger Petersman three Wilson Pro Staff racquets and walked off.   \"VS All Season, 16 gauge, at 72 pounds,\" recited Mr. Petersman, explaining that Mr.  Sampras wanted the racquets restrung with Babolat VS All Season natural gut, average weight, \"tight as a board.\"    Mr. Petersman remembers. \"Pete has at least six racquets strung each day he's at the Open and one freshly strung minutes before he walks onto the court,\" he said.   Granted, Mr. Sampras is considered a bit fanatical about his racquets. (\"It's the most important part of my game,\" he says.) But as head of the racquet-stringing at the Open, Mr. Petersman (like the 20 other top stringers here) is expected to know these things.    During the year, the stringers teach tennis and own pro shops. (Mr. Petersman is the technical product manager for Babolat U.S.A. in Dayton, Ohio.) But they go to the Open to work nonstop from 7 A.M. to midnight -- stringing, balancing and regripping more than 250 racquets each day, or 3,500 during the tournament. \"I can't play here, so I might as well be here somehow,\" said Ian Lev, a stringer from Weston, Conn.    When a string breaks during a match, the racquet is immediately re-strung. The stringer personally runs the racquet back onto the court and hands it to the player.   \"Who else could you trust?\" asked Tom Parry, another stringer.   Not that the players can't afford it, but none of this service comes cheap -- about $60 a racquet, cash, Visa or MasterCard accepted, no checks, no American Express.  Where 'Ball Boys' Are Also Girls, Grown-Ups, and Sometimes, Players     A PATCH of blue in a sea of concrete, 280 more-or-less young men and women are perched high above center court. Having passed rigorous muster for agility, speed, accuracy and, of course, neatness -- but contrary to popular perception, not for powerful connections -- they are waiting for their captain, Tina Taps, to give them their fetching and throwing orders for the first day of play.    In their red-trimmed, navy and white Fila outfits with pure white K-Swiss sneakers, their job as \"ball boys\" (actually 25 percent are girls) is to remain practically invisible on court, while making sure all the tennis balls are flowing in the right direction.    \"I don't watch tennis players anymore; I watch the ball people,\" said Ms. Taps, whose job is to monitor, evaluate and insure that everyone follows the rules of this game.   \"They're not allowed to ask for autographs or to take pictures,\" said Ms. Taps, 35 years old, who during the year works for the United States Tennis Association.   Which is not to say that they do nothing but stand there and wait for a ball to chase. Once, Ms. Taps recalled, Ilie Nastase, the famously temperamental Romanian, asked a ball boy to play out his point in a doubles match. The ball boy, Gary Spitz, was too dumbfounded to do anything but take the racquet and win the point, on camera.   Ms. Taps calls them her kids, and most are teen-agers from Queens. But they are as old as 35, and include a doctor, a lawyer and an accountant. The lawyer is Mr. Spitz, who is 30 and has been doing this for 15 years now. \"I couldn't get a better seat,\" said Mr. Spitz, who is now trying out to be an umpire.  They Just Don't Paint It Like They Used To     Danny Rodriguez Musri spends more than 10 hours a day standing on an electric lift, drawing pencil lines and placing letters and numbers on a big white wall.    That big white wall, looming over the entering crowd, is the main scoreboard. For the last 10 years, Mr. Musri, 37, a graphic artist from Argentina, has been charting the entire Open draw, round by round.   Before the Open opens, Mr. Musri spends several days laying out the board, making sure every measured line is in place. Then he lays down the draw (with names in black computer-generated letters, or red for seeded players). Three quarters of an inch separates first-round names, with more space as the draw winds down, to the commodious two inches of the final round. And for a fortnight of nights. Mr. Musri records the winners and scores of each match.    Because of the scoreboard's location, just left of the entrance, his work area also becomes an instant information booth. On the first day of the Open, fans could be heard asking such well-informed questions as: \"Who will be playing in the final?\" and \"Is Andre Agassi really with Brooke Shields?\"   There are also those who call out, \"Last year, they used to paint it.\" These are the nostalgists, who probably also wish the tournament were still played on grass, and they are only mostly wrong.   Until 1984, the board was painted in a fine calligraphic hand by a man named Jerry Perline, who ran a sign company in Jamaica. Mr. Perline used a French quill brush dipped into an orange juice can full of red paint. At the Open now, no one seems to know how to find him. But Mr. Musri has preserved one small bit of the Perline art: the little brackets linking the two players in each match are done in red paint, by hand.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Following the Fish Through Gateway to Raritan Bay","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/sports/outdoors-following-the-fish-through-gateway-to-raritan-bay.html","abstract":"  In June 1968, the spring of my junior year at college, I moved to a hippie farm in Pennington, N.J.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wield today had he not been assassinated? Not much, I suspect. Dr. King's moral authority rested upon the indisputable fact that African-Americans in the South were disfranchised by a white power structure that stopped at nothing to keep its power. The savagery was evident on the evening news, as when children were set upon with dogs and water cannons in the streets of Birmingham.   The passing of racism's most visible forms -- and the corresponding rise of a black elite -- would have required Dr. King to become more than just a champion of the African-American oppressed. His condemnation of the Vietnam War foreshadowed what might have become a broader strategy. So did his failed fair-housing campaign in Chicago in 1966. There were no dogs and water cannons in Chicago to inspire public outrage. Civil rights rhetoric by itself was no match for a patronage machine that could appear in blackface when it needed to. Dr. King's rallies were anemically attended. The machine, with black underbosses like the legendary Congressman William Dawson, sent Dr. King home defeated.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940904","headline":"Visions of Community With Roots in the 60's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/04/arts/architecture-view-visions-of-community-with-roots-in-the-60-s.html","abstract":"  FOR ARCHITECTS, IT'S TOO SOON for a Woodstock reunion.

Stewart Brand, author of a recent book, \"How Buildings Learn,\" is not an architect, but as editor of the Whole Earth Catalogue, he was the leading champion of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, a design that came closest to providing the counterculture with an architectural symbol.

That applies abroad, too: Clintonites have reversed 12 years of Reagan-Bush policies denying aid dollars to countries where abortion is included in birth control.   They promised and delivered; that's democracy. But then, in the run-up to the U.N. population conference in Cairo, advocates of abortion rights went a bridge too far.   Trickily avoiding the A-word, U.S. sherpas espoused a U.N. statement calling for governments to provide \"reproductive rights\" including 'fertility regulation\" and \"pregnancy termination\" throughout the world -- as if new verbal compounds could conceal the abortion deed.    The Vatican wasn't fooled by these euphemisms, and cunningly enlisted Muslim fundamentalists to reject imposing \"a current life style of certain opulent societies\" (that's satanic Uncle Sam) on third-world nations.   Fine; brings the battle out in the open. But then the Vatican went too far: not only did the Pope's spokesman condescendingly refer to the U.S. Government as \"this Administration,\" but he publicly attacked Vice President Al Gore by name.   The Pope's representative impugned the sincerity of Gore's conciliatory assertion that the U.S. did not seek an international right to abortion. In delivering that shot, the papal spokesman seemed to suggest that the second-highest official elected by Americans was a hypocrite.   That was a personal insult issued in the Pope's name. Unless corrected, it will stand as unprecedented papal meddling in U.S. politics.    It's overreaching enough for a U.S. bishop to predict the political behavior of co-religionists, as Bishop James McHugh did yesterday with his warning of a \"powerful incentive to American Catholics to walk away from the Democratic Party.\" For the Pope himself to permit his official spokesman to rail against any specific American political figure demeans the Vatican -- or \"this papacy,\" as spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls might put it.   Reached by phone in Cairo yesterday, Gore played it cool: \"In dealing with those who are actually negotiating at this conference,\" he soothed, \"I've found people to be constructive and conciliatory on both sides.\"   He found Bishop McHugh \"statesmanlike in saying, even though they will not accept the view that contraception is all right, nevertheless signaling they fully understand that if other organizations wish to make condoms available, they won't strenuously object.\"   Understandably, after feminists, greens and redistributionists got carried away, Gore has been shifting the focus away from abortion to contraception, and then to a wider area of agreement: education and equality for women. Let's hope he can; Perdita Huston's seminal 1979 book, \"Third World Women Speak Out,\" showed that to be a key to family stability.   My objection to the new Malthusians is their insistence that crowding is the obstacle to economic growth and individual advancement. Hong Kong and Taiwan show that to be as untrue as Thomas Malthus's predictions of world starvation two centuries ago. As nations get richer and people get educated, families get smaller.   \"Yeah, I've heard that 'Development is the best contraceptive' for 20 years,\" counters Gore. \"We're adopting a more holistic approach here in Cairo. Availability of contraception; increase of child survival to encourage smaller families; education and empowerment of women; and the economic development to make it easier to establish the others.\"   Conservatives who put individual freedom first can embrace that quartet. The danger comes from the gender-agenda coercionaries overpopulating global conferences who would make governments the levelers of nations and bureaucrats the makers of family decisions. A \"right to develop\" is not an entitlement to a handout.   The Vatican did well to blow the whistle on the power grab of the new Malthusians; the result is the creative tension of open debate. And moral instruction by preachers has a traditional place in politics. But the Pope should tell his arrogant spokesman that he harmed the anti-abortion cause by getting politically mean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940905","headline":"Yes, Cowboys Will Play For Coach Switzer, Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/05/sports/pro-football-yes-cowboys-will-play-for-coach-switzer-too.html","abstract":"  At first glance, the Dallas-Pittsburgh match up was one of running backs, of Emmitt Smith versus Barry Foster, of which team could run first and run last and eventually trample the opposing defense.

Many homeless men said they had long refused to eat the meals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940905","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/05/nyregion/c-corrections-156590.html","abstract":"  A brief report by Bloomberg Business News in Business Day on Thursday, about a plan under which the Castle Energy Corporation will sever its ties with its German parent, Metallgesellschaft A.G., misstated a detail of the plan.

The deal was played July 6 in London, during a celebration of the centenary of the arrival of bridge at the Portland Club in 1894. Some 60 members and guests dressed in Victorian clothes, gathered at the club for drinks, journeyed by horse-drawn omnibus to the Cafe Royal in Regent Street, dined and played a short bridge match: the Portland Club against England.   The game they were playing was not contract bridge, nor even auction bridge, but the original \"bridge.\" This had long been played in Constantinople and other parts of the Turkish Empire, perhaps as far back as the Crimean War. It reached one of London's whist clubs in 1892, and was in New York a year later. The innovation reached the Portland Club by a roundabout route: Lord Brougham took it there from India.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940905","headline":"In Brazil, Slip of the Tongue Makes Campaign Slip","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/05/world/in-brazil-slip-of-the-tongue-makes-campaign-slip.html","abstract":"  A few minutes of frank chat accidentally relayed to satellite dishes across Brazil has cost the Finance Minister his job, and President Itamar Franco struggled today to contain a scandal only a month before the presidential election here.
