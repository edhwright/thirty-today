Over the next 12 years, 125 atmospheric nuclear bombs were detonated, most of them far greater in power than those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n In 1963, the testing went underground. However, some of the 800 bombs detonated were placed so close to the surface that the explosions broke the earth's crust and left craters the size of football fields. Clouds of dust and other pulverized radioactive debris floated across the U.S., just as the atmospheric-test fallout clouds had, landing on wheat fields, reservoirs and cow pastures. Baby boomers drank milk loaded with radiation: iodine 131, cesium 137, strontium 90. Much of the fallout was comparable to that of the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union in 1986.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930326","headline":"Exposing the Lies About El Salvador","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/opinion/exposing-the-lies-about-el-salvador.html","abstract":"  Secretary of State Christopher is right to order a full-scale inquiry into what looks like deliberate concealment of human rights crimes in El Salvador. Senior officials in the Reagan and Bush Administrations appear to have suppressed or ignored damning evidence of Salvadoran military complicity in atrocities. Instead, anxious to avoid any cutoff of U.S. aid during El Salvador's 12-year civil war, officials kept assuring Congress that things were getting better.    In fairness, the inquiry should begin in 1980, since dissimulation began under President Carter. It should address not only official attempts to dupe Congress but also efforts to discourage investigation by news organizations.

With McCoy Tyner's 15-piece big band, the leader's splashy, thick-chorded approach to the piano translates to lush orchestrations in which every register is densely populated: tuba sharing bass lines with the bass, congas meshing rhythms with the trap drums, and brasses (including French horn along with trombones and trumpets) trading melodic sections with saxophones and woodwinds. Harmonies become chorales that use unexpectedly rich chromatic chords, and a prominent flute or piccolo often twitters up above.    The arrangements add detail to the music, but never at the expense of its drive. In Tuesday's second set at the Five Spot (4 West 31st Street, Manhattan), uptempo compositions by Mr. Tyner bustled along, especially \"Fly With the Wind,\" in which a modal vamp and a quasi-African polyrhythm emerged from a rumble of percussion to spur ensembles and solos, then melted into a percussion coda as if to say that rhythm was the music's wellspring.

It exposes the foul countenance of their city's wayward soul. Dorian banished his festering portrait to the attic. We keep ours in the basement. Over the years, ravages intermittently suppressed at street level have settled below ground in a dense sediment of urban pathologies: poverty, insanity, anger and crime. It is not a pretty picture.   Still, a ridership of 3.5 million daily descends to this underground gallery of fear, undeterred by visions of scurrying rats, defaced walls, hollow-eyed vagrants and platforms perilously overcrowded or frighteningly vacant. And, in fact, the subterranean picture has brightened considerably in recent years. Remarkably, at a time of national drift away from public amenity toward increased privatization, the subway has been shuttling valiantly in the opposite direction. In the past decade, supported by two five-year programs authorized by the New York State Legislature, the Transit Authority has carried out extensive overhauls of the aging subway system. New cars and tracks. A fully air-conditioned, graffiti-free fleet. Renovated stations.  Beefed-up security. New automated turnstiles (looking something like an airport metal detector crossed with a casino slot machine) that will soon accept plastic fare cards. There's even a running campaign of radio ads intended to lure New Yorkers back to the depths.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930326","headline":"In Newest Bid, Murdoch Offers To Buy The Post","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/in-newest-bid-murdoch-offers-to-buy-the-post.html","abstract":"  Rupert Murdoch formally offered to buy back the bankrupt New York Post yesterday and to operate the cash-starved newspaper for at least 60 days while he attempts to win the Federal approvals necessary for the purchase.

The development will offer spectacular river views for a whole new group of weekend homeowners, many from New York City.

Carnegie Hall's genteel atmosphere suited Ms. Griffith's tribute to her own genre. In the 1960's, when Ms. Griffith first heard Ms. Hester's voice emanating across the Austin, Tex., radio waves, folk music had been claimed by college students and bohemians. A glance at Ms. Griffith's audience confirmed that the lovers of her simple wisdom were not working-class heroes (those folks prefer Billy Ray Cyrus), but sophisticated urbanites who treat Americana as an esthetic, not a personal, heritage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930327","headline":"Inquiry Focuses on Bomb Suspect's Iterrogation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/27/nyregion/inquiry-focuses-on-bomb-suspect-s-iterrogation.html","abstract":"  While in custody in Egypt, Mahmud Abohalima, a prime suspect in the World Trade Center bombing, gave the authorities information about the conspiracy that may help the investigation, Federal officials said yesterday.

Mr. President, you seem to be having some difficulty with the Pentagon. When you went to the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, the sailors there were mocking you before your arrival even though you are the Commander in Chief. The services have been undercutting your proposal for permitting gays to be in the military. There's been no Pentagon creation of the task force that was supposed to be created. The hearings are to start a week from now, and Congress has not gotten any advice from the Pentagon or from the services as to what to propose. Do you have a problem, perhaps because of your lack of military service or perhaps because of issues such as gays in the military, in being effective in your role as Commander in Chief? And what do you propose to do about it?   A.  No. No, I don't have a problem being Commander in Chief. You knew they -- you knew that a lot of the service officers disagreed with the position on gays in the military before I ever took office. The Secretary of Defense has not been in the best of health. I think he is either fully recovered now or on the verge of it. And I asked him to give me a report on June the 15th.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930327","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/27/style/chronicle-709193.html","abstract":"  WYNONNA JUDD was in New York and New Jersey yesterday promoting eyeglass frames to help in the fight against hunger in the United States.

AID TO RUSSIA SOUGHT    The Clinton Administration has proposed that the International Monetary Fund vastly increase its aid to Russia, to more than $10 billion a year, Western officials said.  1    Russia's pugnacious new Finance Minister is a fighter for reform.  5  CEASE-FIRE IN BOSNIA    The commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia secured agreement on a cease-fire starting at noon tomorrow from the commanders of the Muslim, Croatian and Serbian nationalist armies fighting the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  1  U.S. TO RELY ON PRESSURE ON SERBS    President Clinton said the United States intended to rely for now on economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to get the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan, even though Bosnia's Muslim President told him that without some arms aid his country would not long survive.  4    President Clinton and Chancellor Kohl find common ground: dinner.  4  THE PARADOX OF SANCTIONS    News Analysis: Sanctions imposed so far have ended up strengthening the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and entrenching most Serbs in a dogged commitment to the war in Bosnia.  4  U.N.

The list, in full.  1  HOPING TO CLEAR-CUT A DISPUTE    The forest conference President Clinton is convening in Oregon will be the Administration's biggest and perhaps most difficult effort to show it is possible to protect a rare natural resource without putting a lot of people out of work.  6  PENTAGON PROPOSES WIDE CUTS    The Clinton Administration will propose a military budget of $263 billion for 1994, about $10 billion less than authorized in 1993, requiring wide cuts in troops and weapons systems, Pentagon officials said.  9  CARE ORDERED FOR HAITIANS    A Federal judge ordered the Administration to provide better medical care for the Haitian refugees with AIDS detained at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  9  I.B.M.

It could also establish a precedent for other tribes to press their claims for recognition, thus opening the gates for even more Indian casinos in Connecticut. If the 900-member tribe can prove to Government historians and anthropologists that there were no interruptions in its tribal existence from the time of first contact with Europeans, the Mohegans will receive the status that will give them wider economic, social and political powers over tribal land, including the power to establish gaming operations on their land in Montville.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Player to Get Benefits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/sports/sports-people-college-football-player-to-get-benefits.html","abstract":"  In a decision that could have wide-ranging repercussions for college athletics, the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission has ruled that a scholarship football player is a university employee and as such is entitled to full employee benefits for injuries received while playing his sport.

The Warner Bros. film, \"Grumpy Old Men,\" stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as two hard-boiled lifelong enemies who finally discover the meaning of life -- and each other -- while pursuing the peculiar pleasure of yanking fish out of 10-inch holes cut through two-foot-thick Minnesota lake ice.   The movie's advance scout had found the right expert in the 79-year-old winter angler. Over the decades, Mr. Schwartz's prowess on the ice with the sawed-off fishing pole known as the jiggle stick has earned him the nickname Mavin among bait-store owners and fishing-page editors across Minnesota. Now, Mr. Schwartz was being asked to provide both technical help and several dozen real-life winter fishermen to work as extras in the ice hamlet being built for \"Grumpy Old Men\" on location at Lake Rebecca.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"The War of a Peacetime Soldier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/books/the-war-of-a-peacetime-soldier.html","abstract":"  BUFFALO SOLDIERS   By Robert O'Connor. 324 pp. New York: Alfred A.

And, even when they are indoors, they spend much of their time at their balconied windows, shouting conversations with neighbors or with passers-by in the street below. Apparently, Naples wears its heart on its sleeve; it appears to be a city without mysteries. But this hasty impression is totally misleading. In reality, Naples is a city of secrets. And now a program called Monumenti porte aperte -- Monuments: Open Doors -- is revealing many of them.\n\nThanks to a project sponsored by a number of local organizations and, chiefly, by the alert Fondazione Napoli '99, dozens of the city's monuments -- traditionally, notoriously neglected by the authorities and often ignored by the local inhabitants -- were opened free of charge one weekend last spring. And they were suddenly flooded with visitors, the Neapolitans themselves, who came out, in overwhelming numbers, to see beautiful and historic points in the city. The project's appealing name indicated that many of the city's treasures -- its unparallelled Baroque palaces, its great Gothic and Renaissance churches, its castles, museums, parks -- would be open to all and provided with volunteer, informed guides. The venture was chiefly aimed at schoolchildren, and some 5,000 had signed up for tours of the featured attractions, but, as it turned out, the grown-up Neapolitans wanted to see and enjoy their cultural wealth, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"CUOMO WANTS CAP ON DOCTORS' FEES, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/cuomo-wants-cap-on-doctors-fees-private-and-public.html","abstract":"  As part of a blueprint for major change in New York's health care system, Gov.

The academy's architects have designed a modern athletic thoroughbred of a building. With a sleek, translucent facade of steel and glass, curving as it rounds the bend at East 153d Street just off the Grand Concourse, the design looks every inch a champion, and indeed it is one. Last December, the design won a competition for the most important new public building to go forward during the Dinkins administration.   A lot is riding on this project. With a budget of $230 million, the Police Academy is an important civic symbol, a sign that even in hard times, New York can build major public works. Now housed in crowded quarters on East 20th Street in Manhattan, the academy will be relocated to the South Bronx in an effort to erase the borough's image as a metaphor for urban decline. Not least, at a time when law and order promises to become a major issue in the approaching mayoral campaign, this project offers a conspicuous show of support for the city's law enforcement officers. It also offers an opportunity of overpowering importance: a chance to rethink the critical place of law enforcement in American cities today. This is what lifts the project out of the realm of local news and into a national spotlight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Dizzy's Daughter Has Her Own Career in Jazz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/dizzys-daughter-has-her-own-career-in-jazz.html","abstract":"JEANIE BRYSON was waiting to sing, listening to the piano in the lounge of the New Brunswick Hyatt Regency one recent evening, when the bass player leaned over and made a comment that tickled her.

Now we are finally back on our feet financially and would like to purchase a small home of our own. Can we get a mortgage? . . . Fernando Carrion, the Bronx. Answer: Yes, but it won't be easy. According to Beryl Riley, a mortgage manager with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, your best bet may be secondary lenders, such as Champion Mortgage, which may also charge you a higher rate. Mortgage brokers may also help you find a lender. Some banks, such as Chase Manhattan, will consider an application from someone with a bankruptcy on his credit report, but only if there is a full discharge of the bankruptcy and the borrower has established good or secured credit. Further, two years should have elapsed since the bankruptcy discharge, three years if there is a down payment of less than 20 percent. Also, it should be documented that extraordinary circumstances caused the bankruptcy, such as an extended illness that was not covered by health insurance, and that the event is not likely to occur again. Escrow Accounts Question: I recently refinanced my mortgage, a fixed rate on a private single-family residence. My bank, however, has refused to give me a current escrow analysis. Who regulates escrow accounts? Can I ask my bank for a complete escrow analysis more than once a year? . . . Randy Hunt, Locust Valley, L.I. Answer: No. According to Clare E. Sykes, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Banking, escrow issues are governed by the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which describes how escrow accounts are done, including how often escrow analyses can be requested. She added that analyses must be given annually, but no more often unless the lender desires. If the loan is refinanced by the same lender, the same rule applies. If a new lender refinances, then a new analysis is made. Security Deposit Question: My security deposit for my apartment is in a savings account under the name of the owner. I have a letter from her bank verifying that this account is separate from the owner's other accounts. But who is entitled to the accumulated interest? Also, the owner lives on the West Coast and travels extensively. How can I make sure that my deposit will be returned? Can I not pay my last month's rent? . . . K.A. Hanson, Manhattan Answer: Maybe. According to Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, when a landlord takes a security deposit it must be placed in a trust account and segregated from other money. Technically, he added, the account also has to be in the tenant's name.   He said that if the building had six or fewer units the owner did not have to pay interest. But if it has more than six units the tenant is entitled to the interest in the account, minus a 1 percent administration fee, which goes to the landlord. The interest can be accrued or paid annually; it's the landlord's choice. If the apartment is a New York rent-stabilized unit, the tenant can request that the interest be paid annually.   Mr. Finder said that, in New York, landlords had to return a security deposit within a reasonable amount of time; no exact number of days is prescribed. And though not paying your last month's rent is a violation of your lease, it has also become an almost customary practice. The landlord then keeps your security deposit and, if necessary, pursues a legal action to recover any damages. \"It is common to not pay the last month's rent to get a security deposit back,\" he said.   Technically, Mr. Finder added, a landlord could sue for nonpayment of a last month's rent and the tenant would be responsible for the landlord's legal fees. This rarely occurs, though. And as for any possibility of eviction during the last month, it couldn't be accomplished within 30 days, at least not in New York, he said.   Should you decide to pay your last month's rent, Mr. Finder recommended contacting your landlord before your lease expires and reminding them that you are expecting your deposit back. If you don't receive it within 30 pays, pursue legal action.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"The View From: Washington; Investors Head for the Hills With a New Commodity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/the-view-from-washington-investors-head-for-the-hills-with-a-new-commodity.html","abstract":"  REGARD the ostrich, one of nature's strangest creatures: Little head, long neck, fat middle.

To keep themselves from going mad, they make up various film scenarios and even joke about what might win an Academy Award. Much of the kidding is about Sir Richard Attenborough in general and his Oscar-winning \"Gandhi\" in particular. \"Gandhi,\" Mr. Rea's character observes, seems to go on for more time than he and his cellmates have spent in prison.   In this exchange, however indirectly, the new and old orders of Hollywood collide. Neither this Irish actor nor Mr. Attenborough can be thought of as a Hollywood insider, but anyone singled out for academy honors represents some aspect of the film-making establishment's taste. And that taste is changing dramatically. Six nominations for \"The Crying Game,\" the small and very idiosyncratic film in which Mr. Rea stars, indicate that the big, windy productions in which Mr. Attenborough specializes (this year's being \"Chaplin\") will no longer be acclaimed automatically as high cinematic art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"A World Gone Raving Mad","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/books/a-world-gone-raving-mad.html","abstract":"BALKAN GHOSTS\n\nA Journey Through History.\nBy Robert D.

Mr. Tavener's career (not to be confused with that of the English Renaissance composer John Taverner) is a strange one. Now 49, he began as a populist experimenter, writing in a highly eclectic idiom that synthesized medieval elements with electronic timbres. His first major work, a dramatic cantata entitled \"The Whale,\" created a stir when it appeared in 1968; his opera \"Therese\" (1976) controversially intertwined the contemporaneous lives of the sainted nun Therese and the profane poet Rimbaud.

Those big ones to die for, those 3-by-7-inch color postcards posing as ducats. They cost $400 apiece and the two above would place you and a friend at courtside amid the celebrity elite at the season finale against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls: a chance to wave at Woody or have the Adonis-like Knicks forward Anthony Mason land in your lap. Gaze at the tickets now. Cut them out. Frame them. You may never see them again. At least not in your hand. Or your lifetime. WHAT ELSE: Cheaper Knicks tickets ($12 to $75) are scarcer than humility in George Steinbrenner or hair on Burt Reynolds's head. Thirty-three of the Knicks' 35 home games have sold out. Even scalpers need scalpers. WHERE: Madison Square Garden, 33d Street and Seventh Avenue. CULTURAL BENEFITS: Knicks games have become a nexus of New York culture (or stars just in from wherever), making the gaggle of glitterati that once accompanied Jack Nicholson and his sunglasses to courtside of Los Angeles Lakers games seem underpopulated. It is where film meets hip-hop meets politics meets sports. Only Swifty Lazar's Oscar-night party matches this eclectic turnout. WHO: There's Spike Lee in one of the 58 $400 courtside seats. And John McEnroe, Ronald Perelman, LL Cool J and Ahmad Rashad. Right behind the Knicks bench in his $75 club seat is Woody Allen (no longer spotted with Soon-Yi Farrow Previn). And there's Danny Aiello and Ed Bradley, Bill Murray and Peter Falk, Gloria Estefan and Senator Bill Bradley, Hammer and Rodney Dangerfield, Smokey Robinson and Dustin Hoffman, all sitting courtside. BENEFITS OF THE CULTURALLY ADVANTAGED: Star: \"Hello, this is Arnold. I'm holding up traffic in Times Square while I film my current movie. I'd like two at courtside, please.\" Garden: \"Why, of course, Mr. Schwarzenegger, we always keep eight courtside seats available for cultural icons and gazillionaires like yourself we'd like to showcase in our arena. Will any of the other Kennedys be accompanying you tonight?\" FASHION TIPS FOR THE SARTORIALLY DEPRIVED: The best seat affords scrutiny of Knicks Coach Pat Riley, poster boy for Giorgio Armani. Mr. Riley is a GQ dream, a man whom suits were made for and whom designers would love to dress and send down a runway. He may perspire in those immaculately tailored suits but he wouldn't let it show. When his Armani pants were split during a free-for-all last week against Phoenix, the rip was repaired at halftime. WATCH THE GAME, GET A DANCE: Except for eccentric Dancing Harry, who used to boogie in the stands and hex rival teams during the Knicks' heyday of the 1970's, the Garden had been dance needy until the Knicks City Girls arrived in 1991. The troupe of 15 Paula Abdul wannabes (Ms. Abdul, by the way, is an ex-Laker Girl) have eight outfits from which to choose during their halftime, timeout and between-quarters rock, rap, hip-hop and techno numbers. FUTURE AS HIP HANGOUT: As long as they win. But watch the Knicks crash in the playoffs, and Spike & Company will cross the Hudson for New Jersey Nets games. Stars have already abandoned the Lakers for the Clippers in Los Angeles, so there's precedent. Stars don't want to be seen with losers. It's boring. It's embarrassing. Would Arnold call if the Knicks had 19 victories and 45 losses? Does he go to Dallas Mavericks games? Get out of here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Amherst Coach Earned His Boot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/sports/l-amherst-coach-earned-his-boot-560994.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   Richard E.

Tifft and Alex S. Jones. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) Susan E. Tifft, a former Time magazine editor, collaborated with her husband, Alex S. Jones, a former New York Times reporter, on this saga of journalism's Kentucky barons. The book shows how the Binghams forged a new, liberal tradition for the Louisville press, only to lose all that they had built through family tragedy and bitter feuding. \"Others have told this story previously, but with nothing like this richness of appalling detail,\" Richard Kluger said here in 1991.     BEYOND THE CURVE, by Kobo Abe. Translated by Juliet Winters Carpenter. (Kodansha International, $8.) In this Japanese author's first collection of short fiction to be published in English, haunting, surreal situations continually endanger the characters' sense of self. One man is threatened with metamorphosis into a plant; another, not a man at all but a Martian, risks being committed to a mental hospital because he is, to all appearances, a human being. In 1991 our reviewer, Marian Ury, praised the \"many attractions\" of these \"ingenious stories.\" Kodansha International has also reissued Mr. Abe's novel THE RUINED MAP, translated by E. Dale Saunders ($13), in which a detective's own identity is inexorably lost to that of his quarry, a missing husband.

(One potential backer declined to invest in the play, saying, \"I don't like plays about farmhands.\") In fact, as Max Wilk relates in OK! The Story of \"Oklahoma!\" (Grove, $24.95), Walter Winchell's secretary, seeing the play at a New Haven tryout in 1943, wired her boss: \"No legs no jokes no chance.\" What the show did have proved far more important: a brilliant, lyrical score by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, in their first collaboration; a series of of extraordinary dances choreographed by Agnes de Mille, featuring ballet dancers instead of chorus girls; and a script that took the minds of theatergoers off World War II by celebrating the innocence, vitality and grandeur of the American West. Mr. Wilk, whose many books include \"The Golden Age of Television\" and \"Every Day's a Matinee,\" tells the story with vigor, relying whenever possible on the words of the participants -- including, besides Miss de Mille, Rodgers and Hammerstein, the producer Theresa Helburn, the director Rouben Mamoulian, the conductor Jay Blackton and the costume designer Miles White.

The elections were effectively decided last weekend, when the conservative Union for France coalition won 39.5 percent of the vote and assured itself 460 to 480 seats in the 577-member National Assembly in the runoff. The Socialist Party, in office since 1988, drew 17.6 percent of the vote.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Program Aims to Cut Crime Against Elderly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/program-aims-to-cut-crime-against-elderly.html","abstract":"THE woman on the phone offered 90-year-old Hazel Baldwin of Aberdeen Township a \"free home security survey\" as part of a program to help protect the elderly from crime. Ms. Baldwin agreed, but then she had second thoughts. She called Triad, a pioneering Monmouth County project aimed at reducing crime against the elderly.\n\nHer call was taken by Michael A. Irene, a former police captain, who checked with various governmental agencies. When he learned that none had contacted Ms. Baldwin, he drove to her home on the appointed day and waited in his car.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"Bosnia Accord Appears Near Collapse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/world/bosnia-accord-appears-near-collapse.html","abstract":"  An accord reached Friday on a cease-fire and the delivery of food and medicine to eastern Bosnia appeared on the verge of collapse today as Serbian forces reneged on their promise to allow a United Nations relief convoy to reach the besieged Muslim-controlled town of Srebrenica.    Under the accord with the United Nations, the commander of Serbian forces in Bosnia, Gen. Ratko Mladic, had said the 20-truck convoy would be permitted to go to Srebrenica this morning after having been delayed for more than a week in Mali Zvornik, on the Serbia border with Bosnia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930328","headline":"U.N.

(Talk about overcompensating!) Still, the theme draws attention to a problem so acute that even top actresses have become outspoken about it.    When Emma Thompson accepted the Golden Globe for her performance in \"Howards End,\" she ended her speech by saying, \"If I have a wish left in the world, it is just for the creation of more great female roles.\" It was a generous, enlightening thank-you -- if    she    thinks there's a problem, there must be one. And it suggested that a valuable perspective on the issue would come from women able to choose the best available roles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930328","time":"1993-03-28
