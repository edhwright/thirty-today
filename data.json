But this wonderful idea has a potentially serious downside. The nuclear material -- uranium and plutonium -- extracted during the dismantling process can, conceivably, be sold to or stolen by other countries that hope to build nuclear weapons of their own. What to do? The National Academy of Sciences has some useful ideas.    Highly enriched uranium extracted from warheads is relatively easy to render militarily harmless. Once blended down, it can fuel power plants but cannot be used for warheads without re-enrichment. In contrast, plutonium separated from spent fuel is usable in warheads. It needs to be securely stored and disposed of.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940202","headline":"What It Costs the Military to Do the Job","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/02/opinion/l-what-it-costs-the-military-to-do-the-job-057924.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I certainly agree with the generally favorable tone that \"A Pentagon Promotion for Mr. Perry\" (editorial, Jan. 25) takes on President Clinton's nomination of Bill Perry to be Secretary of Defense.

Laurie Scher, a special-education teacher at Public School 59 in the Bronx, does not have to imagine it. She lived it. Since September, her expected biweekly paycheck of $1,200 has shrunk to $791.    Ms. Scher is just one of hundreds of New York City teachers who have been shortchanged for months because of computer glitches -- and shameful procrastination -- at the Board of Education. Board officials blame a new computer system installed last fall to automate functions that had been handled by 50 payroll clerks. People like Ms. Scher who returned at lower salaries were not the only victims. Salary increases negotiated in the latest union contract failed to show up in the new system, and some teachers found they were making less rather than more money.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940202","headline":"Bomb Trial Focuses on Origin of Video","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/02/nyregion/bomb-trial-focuses-on-origin-of-video.html","abstract":"  A defense lawyer in the World Trade Center bombing trial yesterday showed that a movie depicting a terror bomb attack on an American Embassy, which was played for the jury by the prosecution yesterday, included footage from a Hollywood release called \"Death Before Dishonor,\" about American commandos fighting Muslim terrorists in a fictitious Middle Eastern country.

Though lawmakers from both parties praised his performance in legislative hearings today as strong and competent, Mr. Giuliani, the first Republican Mayor of New York in two decades, left with no promises for more money, especially in the two crucial areas of education and Medicaid. But he did leave with at least a hint that the political dynamic between the city and Albany is shifting and that Republicans are becoming a little more sympathetic to a mayor from the city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940202","headline":"If the Food Can Move, It's Probably Not Done","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/02/style/if-the-food-can-move-its-probably-not-done.html","abstract":"ASK any chef, \"How long does this need to cook?\" and the response will inevitably be, \"Until it's done.\"\n\nTo the nonprofessional cook seeking guidance, that answer can be exceedingly annoying.

Today, as the Kirov begins a weeklong Rimsky-Korsakov Festival here that has attracted many Western critics and visitors, that optimism seems frayed. Both Valery Gergiyev, the artistic director of the opera and music director of the Maryinsky Theater, which also houses the Kirov Ballet, and Anatoly F. Malkov, the administrative director of the theater, sounded grim and pessimistic compared with their mood in 1992.

voyeurism is not the sort of person one expects to be the central character in a movie, even a European art film. But in Joao Cesar Monteiro's deadpan comedy \"Recollections of the Yellow House,\" the director himself plays just such a character. Joao de Deus, the Portuguese film maker's cinematic alter ego, is a bumbling, sad-eyed everyman and sometime hack writer of meager resources who exudes disorder.   Joao is one of several eccentric tenants who inhabit a seedy Lisbon rooming house run by the fanatically proper and puritanical Dona Violeta (Manuelade Freiras). In a mordantly funny early scene, Joao complains to his landlady about bedbugs, which may or may not be imaginary. He even chases down one bug and traps it in a container; but it is invisible to the viewer, and when he displays it for Violeta it is also indiscernible. A bedbug rash is not Joao's only ailment. He also has sores in his mouth and an inflamed groin that requires the wearing of an athletic supporter packed with ice cubes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940203","headline":"Fundamentalists Impose Culture on Egypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/world/fundamentalists-impose-culture-on-egypt.html","abstract":"  With their guns and explosives, Muslim militants have destroyed Egypt's tourist industry, scared away investors and halted Egypt's 20-year march toward democracy and economic liberalization.

The admission is disturbing. The Budget Office's estimates of savings from health care reform, through no fault of its own, are guesswork. Yet Mr. Clinton says he is using such guesswork to shape a reform for a generation.    The Budget Office is required to estimate whether proposed budgets satisfy deficit-reduction targets set out in the 1993 budget law. That is never an easy task. When Congress legislates ordinary tax and spending changes -- such as last year's small gasoline tax -- the Budget Office can generate reliable estimates. But when the issue is huge institutional reform, estimating procedures are not reliable.

The fictional Fishy Waters is an itinerant blues guitarist and singer from the Mississippi Delta. The time is 1959. And Guy Davis, the singer and actor who invented him, plays acoustic guitar and harmonica and sings with a husky, low-keyed intensity.

Leconte is ranked 86th after another comeback following a back injury. Becker had not played since an early exit at the Grand Slam Cup at Munich in December. (AP) Upsets in Tokyo: Marketa Kochta of Germany, scoring her biggest upset ever, beat third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, 7-6 (8-6), 7-5, in the second round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. Fourth-seeded Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic was another upset victim, losing by 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 to Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands. (AP) Canadian Advances: Patricia Hy of Canada, the No. 2-seeded player, breezed by Misumi Miyauchi of Japan, 6-1, 6-1, to advance to the quarterfinals of the Amway Classic in Auckland, New Zealand.

Armstrong scored 20 points, Scottie Pippen added 19 and reserve center Bill Wennington scored eight in the final 6 minutes 52 seconds to lead the Chicago Bulls to a 94-85 victory over the Utah Jazz last night in Salt Lake City.   Wennington drove the lane for a layup with 6:52 to play to put Chicago ahead for good, 75-74. Armstrong, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, then hit a 3-pointer and a layup as the Bulls led 80-76 with 5:29 to play.   Karl Malone, whose 24 points topped Utah, made a 15-footer, but Wennington answered with a baseline jumper with time running off the 24-second clock to put Chicago ahead 82-78. Wennington was 4 for 4 from the free-throw line on the next two Chicago possessions, and Steve Kerr hit a 19-footer from the right baseline to put the Bulls up 88-83 with 1:20 to play. (AP) Spurs 98, Cavaliers 97: Dale Ellis capped a 31-point performance by converting a 3-point play with 4.2 seconds left last night as the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, 98-97, in Richfield, Ohio. It was the Spurs fifth straight victory. Cleveland's Gerald Wilkins missed a wide-open 20-footer from the left baseline as the buzzer sounded, allowing the Spurs to get their second victory in their last 11 trips to Richfield. (AP) Trail Blazers 126, Suns 105: Harvey Grant scored a season-high 29 points and six other Portland players scored in double figures as the Trail Blazers routed the visiting Phoenix Suns. The Blazers built a 23-point lead with four minutes left in the second period and were never seriously threatened thereafter.   Grant connected on 13 of 19 shots, and Clifford Robinson and Clyde Drexler added 17 points apiece. Buck Williams had a game-high 16 rebounds and 11 points for his 20th double-double of the season.   Cedric Ceballos did most of the scoring for Phoenix -- which was without injured players Charles Barkley, Danny Ainge and Kevin Johnson -- with 26 points. Ceballos has averaged 31.4 points in the last five games. (AP) Rockets 99, Lakers 88: Hakeem Olajuwon scored 10 of his 28 points in the third quarter and the Houston Rockets held off a late Los Angeles rally at home. Olajuwon also had 15 rebounds for the Rockets. Otis Thorpe added 20 points and 13 rebounds.   Elden Campbell scored a career-high 29 points and had 13 rebounds to lead the Lakers. Vlade Divac had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and George Lynch added 14 points and 12 rebounds. (AP) N.H.L.  Sharks Top Flyers  Sergei Makarov scored with 1 minute 47 seconds left in overtime last night to lift the San Jose Sharks to a 3-2 victory over the host Philadelphia Flyers. Igor Larionov broke down the ice on the game-winning play, found space along the right boards and spotted Makarov streaking down the left side. He sent the puck across the slot and Makarov scored his 14th goal of the season. Philadelphia is without a victory in its last five games (0-4-1) and dropped below .500 for the first time this season (24-25-3). The slumping Flyers' last victory came on Jan. 19. San Jose has lost only once in their last seven road games (4-1-2). (AP)   Nordiques 4, Blues 3: Iain Fraser's breakaway goal snapped a third-period tie, leading visiting Quebec over St. Louis.

Perhaps cancer was the Almighty's punishment for human conceit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940204","headline":"CLINTON DROPS 19-YEAR BAN ON U.S. TRADE WITH VIETNAM; CITES HANOI'S HELP ON M.I.A.'S","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/04/world/opening-vietnam-clinton-drops-19-year-ban-us-trade-with-vietnam-cites-hanoi-s.html","abstract":"  President Clinton today ordered an end to the trade embargo on Vietnam, casting away a central remnant of one of America's most divisive wars and opening a potentially lucrative market to American goods.   After nearly two decades of a bitter peace, Mr. Clinton said it was now time to acknowledge the cooperation Vietnam has shown in the search for evidence of the 2,238 Americans still officially listed as missing from that conflict, which ended in 1975. He said opening the door to trade would benefit that still-unfinished search.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940204","headline":"Review/Art; A Robert Morris Tour of Contemporary History","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/04/arts/review-art-a-robert-morris-tour-of-contemporary-history.html","abstract":"  Rarely does an exhibition's title pinpoint the central weakness of an artist's work, but \"Robert Morris: The Mind/Body Problem,\" opening today at the Guggenheim Museum, just about hits the nail on the head.    The phrase has deep and complex import for several essayists in the show's catalogue, who go on at great and often obscure length about the meaning of Mr. Morris's Minimalist and Post-Minimalist sculptures, drawings, performances and installation pieces. But for those who like their English straight up and readable, the show's subtitle may signal what this large and admittedly ambitious exhibition ultimately confirms: that Mr. Morris's art is overly didactic and cerebral and weirdly unconnected. It seems to be made by someone with a mistrust of emotion, a disregard for pleasure and a strong pedagogical bent; an artist more involved with problem solving than art making who often reduces the viewer to the role of guinea pig.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940204","headline":"Reviews/ Film; The Pods Are at It Again: Hello!
