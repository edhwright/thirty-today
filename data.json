It was a concept born of another era, certainly another season. The Mets, after all, had given Shea Stadium its worst baseball in more than a quarter-century. By way of response, Shea had limited its outrage and mostly offered indifference through 1993.   Mutual affection, anyway, seemed a bit much to ask after this long season of an angry truce. But corporate sponsors gave away radios and computers and a car. And the Mets, after a season of lurid largesse, didn't give away a baseball game. Positive Stats, for a Change    The Mets beat the Expos, 9-3. Tug McGraw was inducted into the franchise's Hall of Fame. Jeff Kent, after attacking a television camera, returned to the more acceptable activity of menacing a baseball, slugging a grand slam and driving in five runs. Eddie Murray, aware the project won't win him a job at Shea next year, kept adding to his career totals, sliding up the career charts in runs batted in, hits and doubles.

Jim Florio of New Jersey, whose political career seemed all but finished three years ago, has taken advantage of a lackluster Republican challenge to revive his reputation as a leader and has even won a surprising degree of acceptance of his 1990 decision to raise taxes sharply, according to a New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll.    With the Nov. 2 vote five weeks from today, the poll indicates that more New Jersey voters approve of Mr. Florio's performance in office than disapprove of it. Forty-nine percent now even say that Mr. Florio, in the poll's words, \"did the right thing\" in raising taxes by $2.8 billion in 1990. That action was once thought to have fatally wounded his governorship and was the hook on which his Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman, has ever since lashed her ambition to unseat him. Voters also tell the polls that the best thing he has done has been instituting stricter gun control.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930928","headline":"The Why of Somalia : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/opinion/IHT-the-why-of-somalia-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"People wonder why United Nations forces remain in Somalia. .Consider the history: Last fall, world opinion was insisting on military action against Serbian aggressors.

Mrs. Whitman nearly defeated Senator Bill Bradley in 1990 when he ignored her demand that he take a stand on the big tax increases Governor Florio pushed through the then-Democratic Legislature at the start of his administration. The tax hikes were so unpopular that the Republicans won veto-proof majorities in both houses in 1991.

In humans, this occurs if the surgery is performed in the first five months after conception.

But the most peculiar change would have come after the second intermission, when the tenor, transformed into the supposed son of a gypsy, actually split in half and fought a mock duel with himself.   Such are the vagaries of opening-night galas. This one consisted of three separate acts, from three separate operas, united by one theme: the power of the two tenors playing the three roles, who happen to be among the most renowned voices of their generation. The two tenors, in case anybody has missed the best-selling recordings and videos and a generation of hype and well-deserved praise, were Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti (in alphabetical order, to avoid any possible ruffled feathers in their long-term rivalry). Mr. Domingo has the leaner, more pointed voice, able to take on more robust roles in the dramatic category with intelligence and skill; Mr. Pavarotti has had the fleshier, more extroverted (and possibly more popular) instrument, preferring a narrower repertory focused largely on the lyric roles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930928","headline":"There Are Better Ways to Pursue Peace Than Mere Deterrence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/opinion/IHT-there-are-better-ways-to-pursue-peace-than-mere-deterrence.html","abstract":"Nation-states spend too much on the military instruments of security and not nearly enough on prevention, resolution and management of disputes.

These, along with fleeting glimpses of Desdemona and Ariel, led directly into musical images and portraits far more obscure but quite fascinating: orchestral works inspired by Shakespeare and ably conducted by Leon Botstein, the orchestra's music director, at Avery Fisher Hall.   The temptation is to put the word \"controversial\" before Mr. Botstein's name, for as most listeners know by now, he is also the president of Bard College and the editor of the Music Quarterly. It has seemed unjust to many that out of an amateur's love of music and a part-time career, he has managed to become music director of a not insignificant orchestra and the dominant figure in the most important contemporary trend in concert programming during the last 50 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930928","headline":"The Heat's on Glanville as Steelers Feast on His Falcons","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/28/sports/pro-football-the-heat-s-on-glanville-as-steelers-feast-on-his-falcons.html","abstract":"  Missed blocking assignments and bungled tackles led to huge breakdowns.

Unless their geomagnetic survey was mistaken, archeologists thought buried remnants of the wall would be found about 1,300 feet outside the central fortress and its palaces, where the wall presumably encompassed the much larger settlement of craftsmen, merchants and soldiers and sailors.

This one consisted of three separate acts, from three separate operas, united by one theme: the power of the two tenors playing the three roles, who happen to be among the most renowned voices of their generation. The two tenors, in case anybody has missed the best-selling recordings and videos and a generation of hype and well-deserved praise, were Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti (in alphabetical order, to avoid any possible ruffled feathers in their long-term rivalry). Mr. Domingo has the leaner, more pointed voice, able to take on more robust roles in the dramatic category with intelligence and skill; Mr. Pavarotti has had the fleshier, more extroverted (and possibly more popular) instrument, preferring a narrower repertory focused largely on the lyric roles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930929","headline":"How Demand Surged for Prostate Test","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/29/health/how-demand-surged-for-prostate-test.html","abstract":"  DR.

Such a long list makes it hard for courts to line up all the jurors they need at a given time. That's wrong. The list should be repealed.   The under-representation of minorities in jury pools is also wrong. That happens because prospective jurors' names are taken from three lists that do not represent the whole population: registered voters, licensed drivers and the state's mailing list of taxpayers. The Constitution guarantees every defendant the right to trial \"by an impartial jury,\" which the courts have interpreted to mean a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community.
