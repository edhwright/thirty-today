The apple sits on the grass and two little boys are tied by their wrists to a tree while their father sleeps. Whether the boys are tied for punishment or safekeeping is one of the lesser mysteries of this intentionally enigmatic and unintentionally tired Greek film.    Set in a prettily photographed village, the story focuses on the boys as adults. Stelios, the older brother, was an emotionally troubled soldier who drowned 11 years before, possibly a suicide. His body was never found. Yannis, the younger brother, is now a policeman who accidentally gets information that Stelios may be alive, possibly running guns under a false name.

The cellist guided him backstage and sent him off before the next curtain call. And at the end of the concert a sketch artist handed Mr. Rostropovich his afternoon's work, but when the cellist took it with him instead of signing it, the portraitist climbed on stage, looked puzzled for a moment, then headed backstage in pursuit. In between, there were more typical annoyances: antiphonal coughing, but in greater measure than usual, and stragglers.   Mr. Rostropovich's appearances in New York as a recitalist were few during his years as the music director of the National Symphony.

One or two of the performances were to her liking, and she knew one of the actors, always a special pleasure.   Now, she doesn't like every show she sees. There was that reading last summer, three hours about the life of Warren G. Harding, which was the first time she ever fell asleep during a performance. Even so, if she says a show is pretty good, you might want a second opinion. She makes no claims to being New York City's most discriminating theatergoer, though she may well be its most prolific.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950330","headline":"Journal; The Glamour Gap","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/opinion/journal-the-glamour-gap.html","abstract":"  Don't feel sorry for the sequestered O.

The National Labor Relations Board is bearing down on her court, seeking an injunction to restore bargaining issues the owners have taken off the table. If she rules in the board's favor, which she can do for valid legal reasons, the players would end their strike.

This band -- which has just released a new album, \"Vivito y Coleando\" (Xenophile) -- has been marketed as a world-music group, among the few Latin bands to receive the treatment. And given the upsurge in interest in Cuban music generally, it isn't surprising that the Cespedes packed S.O.B.'s on Sunday night with a crowd intent on having a good time.   It's easy to understand the group's reputation: with four horns, a violin, several percussionists and more, it creates a big, thick sound. Though Ms. Cespedes sings religious songs occasionally, this is party music, for dancers. Ms. Cespedes is the key to it all.

At the same time, a new cultural climate is developing and taking hold, which gives crimes against life a new and -- if possible -- even more sinister character, giving rise to further grave concern: broad sectors of public opinion justify certain crimes against life in the name of the rights of individual freedom, and on this basis they claim not only exemption from punishment, but even authorization by the state so that these things can be done with total freedom and indeed with the free assistance of health care systems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/nyregion/no-headline-707795.html","abstract":"  \"The coach gave us the  answer key last year.

His current exhibition at PaceWildenstein on East 57th Street is his best in several years. For a while, it seemed that Mr. Shapiro, one of several talented Post-Minimalist sculptors who emerged in the late 1960's and early 70's, was becoming his generation's answer to Henry Moore. He had all but perfected a race of semi-abstract falling figures, built in blocky beams of wood and then cast in bronze, that had proved quite popular; judging from the life style magazines, it often seemed that a Shapiro figure poolside was de rigueur in Hollywood.    Perhaps Mr. Shapiro's recent commission for the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington pushed him to greater depths in his art, or a moment of reassessment. That piece intensified the drama of his staple forms: not only the ambiguously unbalanced figure whose skewed beamlike limbs seemed to signal human catastrophe, but also the abbreviated geometric house shape, which for this occasion was presented precariously on edge. In that work, Mr. Shapiro depicted a world being blown apart with a clarity of form and meaning that can be the mark of a successful -- which is to say, accessible -- public monument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Fulton Market Fire Investigators Find Blaze Was Deliberately Set","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/nyregion/fulton-market-fire-investigators-find-blaze-was-deliberately-set.html","abstract":"  Fire Department officials said yesterday that the blaze that destroyed one of the two main commercial buildings at the Fulton Fish Market on Wednesday had been deliberately set.

Or we didn't until \"Leona's Sister Gerri,\" Jane Gillooly's searingly effective study of an infamous photograph and how it came into being. Patiently piecing together the facts behind this wrenching image, Ms. Gillooly brings a wide breadth of understanding to the tragedy she uncovers. It's a tale with echoes of Dreiser, and with a sadder-than-fiction authenticity like that of \"Hoop Dreams.\"   The picture, first published by Ms. magazine and later used as potent ammunition in the battle over abortion rights, is that of a woman lying contorted and bloody on a floor. It's an image so bleak that it almost defies closer examination, but Ms. Gillooly quietly sets about determining its origins. The film maker happened onto this material because she knew the dead woman's niece. She presents it with a sense of discreet outrage, and perhaps an awareness that it otherwise would have gone untold.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"The Self and Those Who Tend It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/books/books-of-the-times-the-self-and-those-who-tend-it.html","abstract":"  CONSTRUCTING THE SELF, CONSTRUCTING AMERICA  A Cultural History of Psychotherapy   By Philip Cushman   430 pages.

Given the ascendancy of the therapeutic ethos in America today, the expressed aim of Philip Cushman's new book is certainly a useful one: to trace evolving notions of the self in America and to provide a cultural history of psychotherapy as it has developed in this country in recent years. But while \"Constructing the Self, Constructing America\" is peppered with fascinating insights, the volume is also filled with dogmatic assertions that ultimately color all of the author's arguments. It should not be read as an objective or fair-minded cultural history, but as a highly ideological assessment of American psychotherapy and its social and political implications.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Complicated Fuel 'Fingerprint' Is a Clue to Formula One Racing's Dispute","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/sports/IHT-complicated-fuel-fingerprint-is-a-clue-to-formula-one-racings.html","abstract":"If Formula One racing has become increasingly predictable - Michael Schumacher wins, or Michael Schumacher is disqualified - what remains arcane are the rules of the International Automobile Federation. .There is the rule about a driver's passing anoth","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE : Les Rendez-Vous de Paris","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/style/IHT-the-movie-guide-les-rendezvous-de-paris.html","abstract":"Directed by Eric Rohmer.
