Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) was the United States Congress's first legislative attempt to regulate obscene and indecent material on the Internet. In the 1997 landmark case Reno v.

One non-speech provision of the statute, which exempted the operators of Internet services from liability for their users' actions, survived the Supreme Court's action and was severed from the statute.
