Why the switch? Politics, of course. Still, the Republicans are on the right track. Independent counsels are sometimes necessary to keep government honest.    The White House sees only politics. The President's aides insist that \"no laws have been broken.\" Hillary Rodham Clinton still wonders why anyone is curious about the family's real estate partnership with a failed savings and loan operator.

Berti Vogts, the coach of defending champion Germany, said, \"It could be positive as you can still get three points with one win in your last match and that would probably be enough to get through to the second round.\"   Clemens Westerhof, Nigeria's Dutch-born technical adviser, said: \"I like it because it will encourage more attacking football. There will be no point playing for a draw and we will see more goals scored.\"   Alkis Panagoulias, the coach of Greece, agreed. \"It's a step forward after Italia-90 with those boring 0-0 games,\" he said. \"The two-point gain between a win and a draw forces teams to go forward.\"   Coach Bora Milutinovic of the United States said his team would need at least five points from the three first-round matches to have a chance of advancing. Know Your Opponents    The Americans are in a group with Colombia, Romania and Switzerland. They will open the World Cup with a game against Switzerland June 18 at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., but they will get their first look at the Swiss on Jan. 22 in an exhibition match at Fullerton State College in California.   A game against Colombia on Feb. 20 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami was changed yesterday. The United States instead will play Sweden there. The Americans, who will pay Bolivia on Feb. 18 in Miami, are also trying to arrange a match against Romania in a tournament at Hong Kong during the second week of February.   In the past, countries that qualified for the World Cup were not allowed to play in the host country 30 days prior to the tournament. With most countries being unable to assemble their best players until early May, FIFA changed the rule and now allows games to be staged in the host country just five days prior to the tournament.   The Netherlands  Johan Cruyff, the biggest name in Dutch football, will not coach the Netherlands in the World Cup. Cruyff, who played for Los Angeles and Washington in the North American Soccer League, failed to reach agreement with the Dutch federation.   The flamboyant Cruyff, who led a player revolt against the Dutch federation in the 1974 World Cup, has reportedly asked for $100,000 per month, a 10 percent cut of sportswear merchandising profits and a $200,000 payoff from Barcelona, the club that he coaches.   Jos Staatsen, the president of the Dutch federation, was quoted in European publications saying that Cruyff \"has betrayed his country.\"   While Cruyff is out, Marco van Basten, one of the players featured at the final draw for the Cup last month, hopes to be at full strength despite a series of operations on his ankle.   A fixture at center for the Netherlands, van Basten hopes to rejoin Milan, his Italian Club, in March and be ready for the tournament in June.   Schedule Changes   The Italy-Norway game on June 23 at Giants Stadium has been moved from Game 17 to Game 16 and will have a kickoff time of 4 P.M. instead of 7:30 P.M. Game 17 is now South Korea against Bolivia. It will be played in Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts and its kickoff time will 7:30 P.M.    The Saudi Arabia-Morocco game at Giants Stadium on June 25 becomes Game 22 and will be played at 12:30 P.M. instead of 7:30.   The Argentina-Nigeria game at Foxboro Stadium on June 25 becomes Game 23 and will be played at 4 P.M.

People who have worked to promote the older labor force say that 10 years ago they were confident that, through intensive public relations and educational efforts, American businesses would recognize and harness what they argued are the skills of older workers. Although it is impossible to tally how much money went toward that end, people who work in the field estimated that tens of millions of dollars were spent nationwide on studies, job fairs, seminars for executives and advertising.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940104","headline":"Observer; But Will It Fly?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/04/opinion/observer-but-will-it-fly.html","abstract":"  The promises being made for the \"information superhighway\" are reminiscent of the oversell of atomic energy in the late 1940's.

Four hundred years have passed since his death, and much remains to be discovered about the Italian master. Fewer than 30 of Palestrina's 104 masses have come to light on recordings, and church choirs usually venture no further than his shorter motets. One important corrective will take place on Feb. 2 at the Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, when the Tallis Scholars, matchless exponents of the Renaissance repertory, are to perform the \"Missa Papae Marcelli\" and other sacred works.   First off the mark in New York was the Choir of Corpus Christi Church, whose annual Festival of Lessons and Carols took place on Sunday afternoon. Only two works by Palestrina were heard, but the overall selection of sacred music, mingled with the reading of scriptural texts, gave an intelligent picture of the 16th-century world over which Palestrina presided. The earliest composer represented was Cristobal de Morales, who helped lay the foundations for the Palestrina style during his Roman period; the latest was Tomas Luis de Victoria, probably Palestrina's closest protege.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940104","headline":"Coming Soon: Sports Fights.

Brian Boitano, who continues his Olympic comeback at the United States championships, which begin today in Detroit, got a big hint from international judges in October at Skate America. For the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics, Boitano had planned six triple jumps in the first 2 minutes 40 seconds of his four-and-a-half-minute long program. It seemed a smart tactical decision. He would entrance the judges immediately with his splendid, muscular jumps while getting most of the hard stuff out of the way, lessening the risk to his troublesome right knee with fewer difficult jumps late in the program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940104","headline":"Clintons Continue to Gather Land Deal Files","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/04/us/clintons-continue-to-gather-land-deal-files.html","abstract":"  Two weeks after President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, vowed to turn over all the personal records relating to their investment in a failed Arkansas land deal, their lawyers are still assembling the files before sending them to the Justice Department.

The movie, too, loves this instrument (a replica, the credits reassure us); the camera focuses on the whorled surfaces of the ivory keys, the grain of the wood, the inlaid signature of England's most distinguished manufacturer. We have, by the time of the assault, come to feel almost as much affection for it as Ada, the heroine, does. Mute since the age of 6, she is lost without it; the instrument is literally her voice. And when, early in the film, the piano is alone on a bare New Zealand beach, the white breakers swelling behind, the water lapping at its legs, its otherworldly beauty seems to protect it from forces that would have left an ordinary parlor piano in soggy, warped dissolution.   To review, for those who have not seen the movie: In the mid-19th century, Ada, in Scotland, is married off to a settler in New Zealand. Left on the beach by coarse boatmen, she and her daughter are met by her husband-to-be, who refuses to have the heavy square piano taken on the long trek through the muddy forest. But a thick-limbed Englishman, another pioneer who combines gentleness with strength, takes an interest in the mute, buttoned-up foreigner. He acquires the piano to \"study\" with Ada. He offers her the opportunity to repurchase it, key by key, by allowing him to act out his erotic fantasies as she plays. Ada turns out to be the real student, as her passions are awakened.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940104","headline":"New Careers for Criminals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/04/opinion/new-careers-for-criminals.html","abstract":"  When Congress reconvenes on Jan. 25, it has a chance to do something meaningful about violent crime.

Those who pay attention will notice that pop critics don't share anything close to the unanimity that movie critics often have in their selections. Among the favorite albums chosen by the four New York Times critics who regularly cover nonclassical music, there is no album comparable to \"Schindler's List\" or \"The Piano\" in popularity. Critical tastes, in fact, seem to diverge more sharply this year than in previous top-10 roundups.    Here are the best albums of the year in the views of Jon Pareles, the chief pop critic; Stephen Holden; Peter Watrous, jazz critic, and Danyel Smith.   \"Exile in Guyville,\" Liz Phair (Matador). Sex and love, betrayal and revenge, hope and resignation from a matter-of-fact songwriter whose guitar riffs are sturdier than her relationships.   \"Adventures in Afropea I,\" Zap Mama (Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers). Women's unaccompanied voices ricochet across rhythms and continents, bouncing from pygmy polyphony to automotive sputters, full of playfulness, intelligence and ingenuity.    \"Siamese Dream,\" Smashing Pumpkins (Virgin). Collegiate rock melts into psychedelia with huge fuzz-toned guitar riffs, meticulous arrangements that surge and drift and stomp, and lyrics that question as much as they proclaim.   \"Reachin' (A Refutation of Time and Space),\" Digable Planets (Pendulum/Elektra). Jazz vamps, rolling along on acoustic bass lines, carry smart, amiable raps from a group that welcomes everyone to the party.   \"In Utero,\" Nirvana (Geffen). Sickened by its own success, Nirvana drops the gloss of its multimillion-selling \"Nevermind\" and reverts to punky rawness, with blasts of guitar, howls of confusion and melody despite it all.    \"Traffic From Paradise,\" Rickie Lee Jones (Warner Brothers). Visions of angels and echoes of Van Morrison's \"Astral Weeks\" on an album so fragile and hopeful that it's completely unfashionable.   \"Star,\" by Belly (Sire). Transparent but steely songs that bend clean-lined folk-rock into elusive parables about female archetypes from daughters and sisters to witches and dolls.   \"Zooropa,\" U2 (Island). U2 confirms its metamorphosis, leaving behind anthem-mongering and shifting toward fractured, ambiguous, eccentrically textured, media-saturated riddles.   \"Janet,\" Janet Jackson (Virgin). A slick big-budget album that surveys dance-floor trends and current pop, held together not by a larger-than-life personality but by its determination to seduce.    \"Live MCMXCIII,\" Velvet Underground (Sire). The short-lived reunion of the definitive New York rockers showed why bands everywhere are still stealing ideas from their lean, unsparing, elemental tales of the urban demimonde.

Upon the death of a slaveholder -- encomendero -- the Indians in his possession would come under the tutelage of the throne, to be given instruction in the Roman Catholic religion as free vassals.

The two processes actually have a lot in common. Removing the moisture from fruit almost magically changes its nature, concentrating sweetness and adding deep complexities of flavor. It's as if, when the common denominator of water is removed, the core of the fruit's particular character is revealed.\n\nThis culinary metamorphosis has a long history. People in hot, dry climates have been drying fruits for centuries -- from tomatoes laid out on Italian porticos to apricots drying in Iranian courtyards to chilies on tables outside Tunisian restaurants. Until recently, the primary purpose of this exercise was preservation; when deprived of its water, fruit lasts for months, making it an ideal provision for long and difficult journeys.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940105","headline":"Mexican Rebels Are Retreating; Issues Are Not","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/world/mexican-rebels-are-retreating-issues-are-not.html","abstract":"  The peasant guerrilla army that burst into Mexican life with the New Year retreated today from this town and others it had occupied in the southern state of Chiapas as army troops moved in.

His simple, reasonable proposal is to make gun dealers cover the Government's cost of adequate regulation.    Mr. Bentsen wants to charge licensed firearms dealers $600 a year. That is a sizable increase from the roughly $66 charged now, but it is still a fraction of the fees commonly charged for liquor licenses and franchises to sell merchandise that is not dangerous to use or consume. The citizen lobby Handgun Control, while praising the proposal, argues sensibly that still higher fees would be fair to the weapons industry and the public.    The Brady law, which requires a five-day waiting period for the retail sale of handguns, set the current fee of $200 for a three-year license period. For many years the charge was $10 a year, enough to starve the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and force inadequate background and compliance checks. That fee was so low that 284,000 dealers could afford it even if their only purpose in getting the license was to buy their own weapons more cheaply and sell them on black markets.    Firearms officials want to enable their agents to interview licensees, check to see whether they operate a store or trade from their kitchen tables or car trunks, and verify some of the information they gather with local police. A pilot program involving a team of Federal and local officials in New York City recently resulted in the rejection or withdrawal of 216 of 227 Federal license applications.    According to the Treasury Department, a $600 license fee, besides financing a more trustworthy examination, would probably eliminate four-fifths of the licensees, leaving only serious retailers. That's still 57,000 sources of personal weaponry in the United States -- far too many for a nation that is trying to combat gun violence.    Congress should therefore use the Bentsen proposal as a starting point for stronger legislation that exacts even higher fees, driving more marginal dealers out of the market and making sure that those who remain are doing business in legitimate, fixed locations.    Bolder legislation is feasible. Legislators are gradually learning that voting against the wishes of the National Rifle Association is not automatic political death. Witness the hard-won victory for the Brady law. Witness, too, the willingness of the New York State Senate to consider restraints on assault weapons.    When Congress looks at the Bentsen proposal it will see that $600 is a modest fee that would make the firearms industry pay its way only in terms of regulation. The industry doesn't even begin to repay society the cost of the homicides and maimings from too easily obtainable weapons.

They said the strategy would make it unlikely that a major welfare bill would pass Congress this year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940105","headline":"Feud Ends in Killing Of a 10th Grader At a Brooklyn Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/nyregion/feud-ends-in-killing-of-a-10th-grader-at-a-brooklyn-home.html","abstract":"  A feud between two high school students in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn ended yesterday when one accused the other of harassing him and then stabbed him to death during a dispute over money and a music tape, the police said.

The trial, expected to last a month, is certain to tarnish the reputation of a program that has been viewed for years as a national model for assisting minority-owned businesses.

Hahn died only 47 years ago, so perhaps history's verdict is not final.

Gary Lakes, who sang the role when the production opened last month, took over for Aeneas's farewell.    A singer whose voice is properly supported can sing through a sore throat, and in the dead of winter this is more common than audiences usually know. The problems with Mr. Frey's Aeneas could not all be ascribed to illness. From the start, his sound was powerful enough to cut through Berlioz's hefty orchestration, but he sounded fuzzy, as though he were singing with a mouthful of cotton.

Yet those troubles still unsettle, as is evident in the Holy See's decision to establish its embassy in Jaffa, which has an Arab identity though it is within Tel Aviv's municipality. Church spokesmen insist that a Franciscan building there was chosen for economic and technical reasons, not to define a political distance between the Vatican and Israel. It is a textbook example of diplomatic euphemism that nobody is expected to believe.    Few issues have caused harder feelings between the Holy See and Israel than the status of Jerusalem. Successive popes have called, before and since Israel's birth in 1948, for territorial internationalization of the Holy City and its sacred shrines. What rankled the founders of the reborn Jewish state was the Vatican's indifference to the political regime in Jerusalem so long as the city was governed by Arabs. Only when Israel initially proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital, and when the Old and New cities were united by Israeli arms in 1967, did the Vatican emphasize the necessity of internationalizing Jerusalem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"National Endowment Cuts Theater Training","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/theater/national-endowment-cuts-theater-training.html","abstract":"  The National Endowment for the Arts, responding to a budget cut by Congress earlier this year, is eliminating its 20-year-old Professional Theater Training Program, which supports 16 of the nation's premier drama schools, including the Juilliard School, the Yale School of Drama and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.

It needs a postwar reconstruction policy just as Russia does, and cannot succeed alone. Foreign policy -- a concept for reliable security -- is as essential a component as it was after World War II.   The cost of the cold war must be included in order to grasp where the U.S. stands in the world and how to proceed. A crucial element in Britain's rapid decline after World War II came from its attitude toward the outcome of the war. The other countries knew they had been defeated, early or late in the conflict, and faced an enormous task of rebuilding and relaunching their societies. Because it was never occupied, Britain believed it had won the right to relax.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"Review/City Ballet; Differing Perspectives on the Spirit of Romance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/arts/review-city-ballet-differing-perspectives-on-the-spirit-of-romance.html","abstract":"  George Balanchine's \"Haieff Divertimento\" and Peter Martins's \"Barber Violin Concerto,\" presented by the New York City Ballet on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater, are essentially examinations of the Romantic spirit.
