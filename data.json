Poseidon Press. $19.     It's hard not to compare \"The Law of Falling Bodies,\" Jill Ciment's radiant first novel, with Mona Simpson's \"Anywhere but Here\" (1986). Both novels feature impossible, eccentric mothers, who are blinded by the glitter of their own fickle dreams, and their conflicted daughters, torn between filial devotion and a desperate need to make independent lives of their own. Both take place on the road to and in California. And both mark the debuts of writers blessed with an uncommon gift for language.   \"Falling Bodies\" isn't as ambitious a book as \"Anywhere but Here\": it doesn't tackle a whole slice of contemporary history or attempt to reinvent traditional literary myths, as Ms. Simpson's remarkable novel did. Instead, Ms. Ciment (pronounced sih-MENT) contents herself with telling the whimsical story of a single mother and daughter. Yet in fulfilling her modest aims, the book completely beguiles the reader. It is sad, funny and affecting, completely assured in its portrayal of the complicated mathematics of family emotions: one of those novels you want to mail to friends.   Told in first person, \"Falling Bodies\" is the story of Kimberly and her efforts to come to terms with her mother, Gloria. Gloria Gail -- the name seems meant to recall Dorothy Gael, who crossed the rainbow to Oz -- is one of those inveterate dreamers, who's convinced that a gold mine lies just beyond the horizon, that a jackpot has just eluded her reach. She's a kind of female Gatsby, someone eerily attuned to the romantic possibilities of life.   \"My mother didn't care about a bigger house or a swimming pool,\" Kim recalls. \"Possessions, in point of fact, held no interest whatsoever for her. What my mother was after, had always been after, was something outside of material gain, something that rendered the big house empty, the pool drained of meaning. I'd seen my mother standing in front of a gumball machine with prizes, as transfixed by the plastic jewelry, squirt guns and jawbreakers as Cortes was by the Aztecs' gold. Obviously, at 44 years old, it was inconsequential to her what the machine would expel, a tutti-frutti sucker or a brass ring. Yet each time she dropped another copper penny into the slot, her breath caught.\" She lived, dreamed and breathed \"for those exalted moments between the promise and the prize.\"    Charming, compulsive and almost endlessly hopeful, Gloria spends her days and nights drinking coffee and dreaming up schemes that run the gamut from insurance scams to pyramid games to the marketing of bizarre new products. Though she has sold Geiger counters, weight-loss potions and treadmills for pets, Gloria's specialty is an aphrodisiac perfume. For years now, she has driven from town to town in California and Nevada, selling vials of this magic elixir from her car trunk, and she has dragged her daughter with her. By the time Kim is 15, she has attended 12 elementary schools and two junior highs. She has lived in 13 trailer parks and driven over 90,000 miles. She hopes that when the numbers on the car's odometer reach zero again, \"our lives could begin anew.\"    Fate intervenes in the shape of a 40-something widower, a kind, patient man named Arthur, who one day drives smack into Kim and Gloria's trailer. Gloria refuses to go to a hospital -- she's wanted for mail fraud and is scared of talking to the police -- and Arthur sheepishly allows her and Kim to recuperate in his house.   Much to everyone's surprise, the three soon settle into a comfortable domestic routine. Kim feels she has finally found a home. Arthur feels he has finally found a family. And Gloria, well, Gloria feels she can still come up with an idea that will bring her hope and glory.   As the weeks and months pass, however, Kim begins to fall in love with Arthur. Though she knows her mother has already shared Arthur's bed, she makes a clumsy, girlish effort to seduce him. The following day, Arthur abruptly disappears, leaving Kim and Gloria his house. By the end of the summer, they realize he is not coming back.   Kim eventually goes off to college, gets a job and tries to begin a new life. She's tired of her mother's delusions, her self-absorption, her relentless scheming. Gloria, meanwhile, resumes her itinerant life as a peddler of perfume. Her ambition now is to become a guest on the new \"What's My Line\" television show. She dreams of stumping the panel and becoming a cult figure, a kind of Lucille Ball.   Improbably enough, Kim meets Arthur again, and quits her job to move in with him. It is only when her mother suddenly resurfaces, desperate, needy and finally, it seems, willing to abandon her dreams, that Kim realizes she cannot escape her past, that she may very well have to choose between her mother and her new bourgeois life with Arthur.   In summary, such events may feel cartoonish and contrived, but as related by Ms. Ciment, they take on a palpable weight of emotion. There is a sweetness, as well as an acerbic humor, to her writing, and these qualities burnish the story of Gloria and Kim with a warm, affectionate glow.   Certainly, \"Falling Bodies\" suffers from a number of mistakes common to first novels, most notably a tendency on Ms. Ciment's part to let her narrator recount events and emotions she could not possibly know. Such stumbles, however, never detract from the pleasures of this keenly observed and beautifully written novel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"A Bad Retreat, in the Air","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/opinion/a-bad-retreat-in-the-air.html","abstract":"  It's easy to see why the Clinton Administration decided to allow a partial merger of British Airways and USAir: The agreement will help financially shaky USAir become a worthier competitor to American, United and Delta.

This was the last of four Bullets games played in Baltimore this season, and Washington's only victory. Harvey Grant's 15-foot jumper with 1 minute 4 seconds left in the game gave Washington the lead for good.   Cleveland shot 64 percent from the field in the first half and took a 58-46 halftime lead. In the second half, the Cavaliers slipped to 44 percent, scoring only 19 points in the fourth quarter.   \"We sat around for three days, and we just came out not sharp, and we did not have any enthusiasm,\" said Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens. \"We did not play well as far as I was concerned.\"   In the Central Division race, Cleveland dropped to two and a half games behind first-place Chicago.   In the fourth quarter, the lead changed hands seven times before Washington scored 10 straight points to take a 99-90 lead with 4:21 left. Cleveland then went on a 9-0 run and tied the game at 101-101 on a basket by John Battle with 2:14 remaining.   Grant hit his go-ahead jumper a minute later.   Tom Gugliotta led Washington with 23 points and 10 rebounds, while Grant added 21 points and LaBradford Smith 20.   Brad Daugherty led the Cavaliers with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Bulls 101, Clippers 94    Because of double-teaming on Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, B. J. Armstrong took charge and scored a career-high 28 points, 12 in the fourth quarter, as Chicago won at home.   Pippen also finished strongly, scoring 11 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Jordan had 23.   After a layup by Stanley Roberts with 2:56 left cut Chicago's lead to 91-90, Pippen countered with a 3-point field goal. Armstrong scored the Bulls' last 7 points -- with a 3-pointer and four free throws. Heat 103, Nuggets 100    Glen Rice scored 30 points, hitting two key 3-pointers in overtime, as Miami rallied from a 7-point deficit in the extra period to win in Denver.   It was the Heat's ninth victory in the last 10 games.   A pair of free throws by Bryant Stith, a 16-foot jumper by Tom Hammonds and a 3-point play by Robert Pack put Denver ahead by 98-91 with 3:25 left in overtime.   But Grant Long hit a pair of free throws, Rice connected on a 3-pointer and Bimbo Coles hit a 14-foot jumper to tie the score at 98-98. After a Denver turnover, Rice hit another 3-pointer with 1:32 left to put the Heat ahead to stay.   Jackson's 22-foot jumper with 1:15 left accounted for Denver's last points. Smith hit a pair of free throws for the Heat with 11.6 seconds remaining, and Stith and Reggie Williams both missed 3-pointers before time expired.   Denver's Dikembe Mutombo had a career-high 23 rebounds but only 8 points. Lakers 92, Spurs 87    James Worthy scored 24 points and Vlade Divac and Byron Scott added 17 each as Los Angeles defeated the Spurs for the Lakers' second victory in San Antonio this season.   Los Angeles, which played three games in four days, finished a five-game road trip at 3-2.   David Robinson led the Spurs with 26 points as San Antonio lost for just the sixth time at home. But the center was held to just 4 first-half points, and San Antonio's power-forward tandem of J. R. Reid and Antoine Carr combined for only 13 points all night.   The Lakers led by 76-71 with five minutes to play when Anthony Peeler hit a 3-point shot and Divac followed with a free throw to put San Antonio 9 points behind.   San Antonio Coach John Lucas, 28-11 since replacing Jerry Tarkanian, attributed the loss to the 23 turnovers. Sean Elliott had 17 points but 7 turnovers.   Lakers center Benoit Benjamin was ejected with 9:16 left in the game for flagrantly fouling Sean Elliott on a drive to the basket. Jazz 109, Mavericks 96    Karl Malone rebounded from one of his poorest performances of the season by scoring 36 points, and Utah won in Dallas to extend the Mavericks' club-record losing streak to 19 games.   The Mavericks have lost the 19 games by an average margin of 20 points.   If Dallas loses to visiting Orlando tomorrow, it will tie the league record for consecutive defeats in a season, held by the 1972-73 76ers.   Malone scored 15 points before being ejected in the fourth quarter of a 104-95 loss to Houston on Saturday. Against Dallas, he hit 12 of 17 field-goal attempts and 12 of 13 free throws, and added 8 rebounds.   With next season's coach, Quinn Buckner, in attendance, the Mavericks turned in a rare competitive first half, trailing by just 49-44 at intermission. Utah broke the game open in the third quarter, using a 21-8 run over the first 6:27 to build a 70-52 lead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930316","headline":"Hwang Play Closes After 8 Previews","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/16/theater/hwang-play-closes-after-8-previews.html","abstract":"  \"Face Value,\" the troubled $2 million farce by David Henry Hwang that was to open on Broadway on Sunday, has closed after eight previews at the Cort Theater.

Not too many, mind you, and hardly any at all in those made-for-television movies on commercial networks beholden to advertisers. So it's hardly surprising that \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" a factual account of the takeover madness of the 1980's, has been made for sponsor-free pay cable. The flawed but fascinating production, starring James Garner, has its premiere on HBO on Saturday at 8 P.M.   Based on the exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, best seller by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, \"Barbarians at the Gate\" chronicles the multi-billion-dollar battle in 1988 for RJR Nabisco, which at the time was working feverishly on developing a \"smokeless cigarette.\" The machinations were incredibly complex, requiring bankers galore and backfield lawyers for the lawyers on the front lines. Condensing the story into a movie running less than two hours, Larry Gelbart, the creator of television's \"M*A*S*H,\" has eliminated the players in the middle layers to focus almost entirely on the top-level principals, most notably F. Ross Johnson, chairman of RJR Nabisco, and Henry Kravis, the master of leveraged buyouts at the Wall Street concern Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Sense of Family Helped Jury in Sex-Assault Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/nyregion/sense-of-family-helped-jury-in-sex-assault-case.html","abstract":"  Most days Donald Murray brightened the jury room with a stream of jokes.

This triple birthday celebration, one month into the trial, was a large first step in the transformation of jury into family, some of the Glen Ridge jurors recalled today. Daily, as a trial predicted to last six weeks stretched into five months, they said they worked to include everyone in common activities and to cultivate an atmosphere of unity and belonging. In the end, when the anger and shouting of deliberations came, the sense of family served them well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/us/c-corrections-788193.html","abstract":"  An obituary yesterday about Paul C.

Sirois; scenic painter, Terry Starr; stage managers, Susan M. Kelleher and Lisa Jean Lewis; technical director, Zeke Zaccaro. Presented by the Village Theater Company, 133 West 22d Street, Chelsea. Through March 20 WITH: Christopher Bailey, Julia McLaughlin,  Michael Curran, Bill Christ, Barbara Berque and Michelle Berke.  Jarret (Christopher Bailey), the central character in Thomas Hinton's comedy \"The Best of Sex and Violence,\" is a sour milquetoast of uncertain sexual orientation who teaches medieval history at a Connecticut college. In the course of a single evening, he is visited by his ex-wife, Karen (Barbara Berque), by his quarreling neighbors, Marion (Julia McLaughlin) and Randell (Bill Christ), and by the neighbors' 20-year-old son, Robert (Michael Curran), who wants to live with Jarret as his lover.    The play aspires to be a latter-day drawing room comedy descended from Oscar Wilde through Noel Coward to Harvey Fierstein. The dialogue is nonstop pronouncements trying desperately to be epigrams but ending up merely hysterical. Among these one-dimensional mouthpieces for varying sexual attitudes, the most outspoken is Randell, the chauvinistic coach for the college debating team, who declares, \"I want to be buried in a sea of women I made pregnant.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Lilco's Emissions Sale Spurs Acid Rain Concerns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/nyregion/lilco-s-emissions-sale-spurs-acid-rain-concerns.html","abstract":"  The Long Island Lighting Company wants to sell the right to emit pollution to a fuel supplier that would resell the pollution rights to any of a dozen utilities scattered around the Midwest, South and West, according to documents made public yesterday and people involved in the deal.

Yet after three decades America is far from delivering on the promise of the case called Gideon v. Wainwright.    In courts across the land, judges must beg the private bar to step up and take on criminal cases for which many lawyers are poorly equipped and grossly undercompensated. Public-defender systems are soft targets for budget cutters, state and Federal. Congress, which must pay for counsel appointed in the Federal courts, is perennially guilty of late and inadequate funding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-90063400234.html","abstract":"Speak Up for Health Care.
