Mr. Sharp, a fixture in downtown Manhattan's avant-garde music clubs, is well known for his refusal to stick to any single style of music or grouping of musicians and for his insistence on breaking down the perceived barriers separating composed music, improvisation, rock, jazz and acoustic theory. In his most basic guise, he hops onstage with any band and improvises on his double-necked bass-guitar; at his most complicated, he twists music derived from mathematical concepts like the Fibonacci series or fractal geometry into dense sonic structures.   On Thursday, Mr. Sharp demonstrated that he is no mere dabbler: his vast array of compositions were all unified by a thick, chunky sound and sharp, pointillistic playing. The evening began with a strong series of pieces played by Mr. Sharp's guitar quartet, which also included Roger Kleier, David Mecionis and John Myers. Though the group investigated the shimmering overtones that can result from clusters of synchronized retuned guitars (as heard in the music of Glenn Branca), it also explored other terrain, from the out-of-phase riffing of \"Residue\" to the Sonic Youth-style dissonance of \"Flowtest,\" both from the band's new album, \" 'Dyners Club,\" available from the Swiss label Intakt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941229","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/29/nyregion/c-corrections-242047.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 19 about hiring by New York State during the transition between the Cuomo and Pataki administrations referred incorrectly in some copies to the agency being monitored by Michael Clemente, a Pataki transition aide.

The streets are swarmed and the restaurants packed with prospective merrymakers, all seeking the right place and atmosphere to share the ballyhooed moment when the calendar changes. Live music, with its promise of instant community and Dionysian prospects, is a potent lure; from the jazz cafes to Madison Square Garden, music packs 'em in, as people choose to spend the evening with others who share their taste or dance to the same beat.   For many people, putting on a party hat and slipping a CD into the home stereo -- or watching the Guy Lombardo Orchestra on PBS -- just doesn't provide the same excitement.

Tropical plants hug the walls, and music throbs as tall men wrapped in sarongs weave through the tables with feline grace. The room is dim, and the sultry air is perfumed with the mingled aromas of ginger, lemongrass and curry.   When the owners of Penang Malaysia Cuisine, a wonderfully authentic Malaysian restaurant in Flushing, decided to take their act to SoHo, they left behind the harsh storefront lighting, the plastic tablecloths and the cash-only policy. They also abandoned the fish-head soup. Clearly, June and Stanley Cheah had more in mind than just opening an ethnic restaurant in an upscale area of Manhattan. They seem to have edited their menu to introduce their country's little-known cuisine in the most appealing fashion. Penang is the opposite of those Chinatown restaurants where hopeful diners are invariably told \"You won't like that\" when they order exotic dishes. The Cheahs want you to love their food, and since opening in early November they have done everything they can to see that you do.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/sports/results-plus-251160.html","abstract":"  N.B.A. Curry Helps Hornets Halt Magic's Streak  Dell Curry scored 28 points and Charlotte, playing without the injured Alonzo Mourning, made a club record 14 3-pointers to beat the Orlando Magic, 125-123, last night. Curry sank 6 long-range shots and host Charlotte made 14 of 22 in snapping Orlando's 5-game winning streak. The Hornets made 13 3-pointers in a victory earlier this season at Utah.

Gibbs announced his resignation in November but chose to coach through the bowl game. Walsh threw a 43-yard completion on the first play of the game and did not slow down. The quarterback wound up 31 of 45, setting a Copper Bowl record for completions. The Cougars finished the season 10-3, Oklahoma 6-6. (AP) WOMEN'S BASKETBALL St. John's Wins Title in Own Tournament  Tawana Jackson's pair of free throws with 14 seconds left capped a 21-point performance last night that helped St. John's to an 81-77 victory over San Diego State in the championship game of the St. John's Christmas Invitational Tournament at Alumni Hall. Jackson, who was named most valuable player of the four-team event, also had 6 assists, 4 rebounds and 4 steals for the Red Storm (5-3). Suzanne Collins added 17 points, going 13 of 18 from the foul line, with 10 rebounds.

Andrew Davis revived one of them on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, when he led the New York Philharmonic in a program that showed the kinship between Russian and French music. The musical accents are distinct, yet because Russian composers tended to look toward France rather than Germany for models, the music often shows traces of a French sensibility, particularly in matters of coloration and lyricism.   Mr. Davis showed that this influence was not a one-way street. The exoticism that drives Borodin's \"Polovtsian Dances\" is mirrored in a more sophisticated way in Ravel's \"Bolero,\" composed about half a century later. Borodin's vision was of a mythical tribe of nomads in ancient Russia and Ravel's model was essentially Spanish and contemporary, yet both rely heavily on modal, Eastern-tinged melodies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"Home Video","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/arts/home-video-253227.html","abstract":"  For all the talk about CD-ROM and multimedia, home video's plan for next year is as basic as it was this year: to replenish a stream of big movies selling millions of cassettes.

Like most jokes, Black Velvet Flag gets less and less funny with each telling. The band plays sedate lounge-music versions of raucous punk-rock classics by California bands like the Germs, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks. Occasionally, the band tosses a few similarly anomalous original songs into their straight-faced performances. James Chance, on the other hand, is the real thing. A survivor of New York's noisy no-wave scene of the late 1970's, Mr. Chance continues to merge punk, funk and free jazz. While John Lurie, the star of several of Jim Jarmusch's films, is informed by punk and lounge music, he will probably be looking to avant-garde jazz and pop music for his smart, sometimes noisy saxophone playing during this rare solo performance. The show is to begin at 10 P.M.; tickets are $25 in advance and $30 on the day of the show, and include hors d'oeuvres, a Champagne toast and party favors. Reservations accepted for tables. NEIL STRAUSS Women and Men    Friggs and Jackass, Brownie's, 169 Avenue A, East Village, (212) 420-8392. This might be one of the only nights to see these two bands without getting jostled and nudged by myriad talent scouts looking to sign them to a record label. The Friggs are four women who play garage rock that hits as hard as surf music and swings as much as rockabilly. Jackass is a group of men who have an edge on other bands that play disaffected guitar grunge: its lead singer would look good on a magazine cover. Also appearing: Trickbabys, Clowns for Progress, and N.Y. Loose. The show is to begin at 8:30 P.M.; tickets are $10 in advance and $12 on the day of the show. N. S. Rocket From the Crypt    Rocket From the Crypt, Swingin' Neckbreakers and Portastatic, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Maxwell's capacity is probably less than that of a New Year's Eve party in a Manhattan studio, but if a sense of community and a strong, mixed-bag lineup of alternative rock is what you're looking for, then look no further. Rocket From the Crypt is a band from San Diego that mixes pop contrivances with punk-rock spontaneity, the Swingin' Neckbreakers play melodic, high-energy garage rock that seems untouched by any musical innovation since 1965 and Portastatic is the name for Mac McCaughan of Superchunk's side project, which plays pensive solo songs and slow-building group rockers. The show is to begin at 10:30 P.M.; admission is $25 and includes a buffet and Champagne toast. N. S. A 15-Hour Party    Heaven, at a location to be announced this afternoon, (212) 592-4444 or (212) 696-8939. Heaven, a huge rave being held in a warehouse that holds some 3,500 people, is the perfect place for partygoers who want to test their stamina. It begins at 9 P.M. on New Year's Eve and ends on noon the next day. The 15-hour party features live drummers, performances and the latest electronic dance music played by disk jockeys from around the world. The highlight of the night should be the set by Juan Atkins, a musician and disk jockey from Detroit who was a pioneer in techno dance music. Also to appear working the turntables are Doc Martin from Los Angeles, Paul Van Dyk from Berlin, Wild Child from London, Tiga from Montreal. For those who can still stand, the party is to move to another location after noon for more of the same. There will be no Champagne at Heaven, but there will be free whistles, flashlights and noisemakers. Tickets are $18 in advance and $22 tomorrow. N.

The move puts into place a budget that will reduce spending for virtually all municipal services, even while it leaves many aspects of the budget unclear.   Mr. Giuliani's decision to cut the budget by such a large amount on his own -- the first step of such magnitude by a mayor -- comes a week after a state judge threw out both his initial budget proposal and an alternative version of cuts enacted by the Council. The Mayor's aides said his latest move would finally allow them to achieve their goal of balancing the city's $31.6 billion budget by cutting city spending by nearly 4 percent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"U.S. Tells Haitians Held at Guantanamo They Must Go Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/world/us-tells-haitians-held-at-guantanamo-they-must-go-home.html","abstract":"  The United States moved today to end its policy of providing safe haven to Haitian refugees, giving Haitians living at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay formal notice that they would have to go home.

Yet in the two years he occupied the director's suite, James Woolsey showed little sign that he could see beyond the cloistered world of an agency overtaken by history.   Mr. Woolsey's resignation this week was merely ratification of a fatal loss of Congressional and public trust over his handling of the Aldrich Ames case, the most serious betrayal of American intelligence secrets in the cold war. His gentle disciplining of officials who failed to detect or pursue Mr. Ames's mercenary work for Moscow, long before Mr. Woolsey's arrival, may have satisfied the C.I.A.'s internal standards of justice.

His literary interests, his extensive writings on art and his activity as the editor of the influential series of translations \"The Documents of 20th-Century Art\" have all conspired to leave an image of an artist who was too intelligent for his own good. Abstract Expressionist painting was supposed to come from the gut, or so the cliche ran, while Motherwell painted with his head. Knoedler & Company has set out to dispel this image by presenting a selection of pictures from Motherwell's most successful series of paintings, \"Elegies to the Spanish Republic.\" Four large canvases devoted to this theme are accompanied by a closely related work, \"At Five in the Afternoon,\" and by a dozen smaller studies on paper and cardboard. The result is a triumphant vindication of Motherwell's pictorial talent.   One's first impression upon entering the gallery is that of a tremendous consistency, a consistency that does not become repetitive but adds to the cumulative impact of Motherwell's paintings. Although the series was begun in 1949, the earliest canvas here dates from 1958-60. It sets forth the basic elements of the series: a succession of broad black vertical bands, often rounded and curving at their bases, interspersed with black ovoids floating before a white background. The stark contrast of blacks and whites evokes the blinding sunlight and inky shade of a Spanish afternoon, while the semi-abstract black forms suggest a bull's sex organs, as E. C. Goosen, the art critic, pointed out in a 1959 article on Motherwell. (The sacrificial ritual of the bullfight and the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War were intimately linked in Motherwell's personal iconography.)

His status as one of the foremost American painters of the 19th century is a posthumous development; during his life, the unalloyed realism of Eakins's art cost him commissions, prizes and visibility. His famous masterpiece \"The Gross Clinic,\" a grisly if monumental portrait of Dr. Samuel David Gross presiding over a lecture and operation, so repelled the selection committee of the 1876 Centennial Exhibition that it was displayed not with other paintings, but among medical exhibits in a hospital.   In fact, while respected by a small circle of friends and artists and revered by his students, Eakins spent most of his career on the margins of the official art world, where he found himself after being dismissed from his prestigious post at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1886. At issue was his unstinting pursuit of anatomical accuracy: he insisted on using completely nude models in classes that included students of both sexes. His study of the body also included the taking of photographs of nudes for which he, his fellow teachers and his students posed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/style/chronicle-254215.html","abstract":"  EDWARD and BETTY SCRIPPS are so fond of their doctor, EDWARD C.

Elliott Sharp, a guitarist who is a fixture on the downtown experimental scene, is to lead a trio that will show his roots. From 9:30 P.M. to midnight, he is to play jazz standards; at midnight he is to start playing blues. A four-course dinner and a Champagne toast is $90. There's no cover at the bar. PETER WATROUS James Blood Ulmer    James Blood Ulmer and Defunct, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. This New Year's Eve is James Blood Ulmer's sixth at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes uses of drones and odd tunings, is distinct. It's hard-rocking, slippery music charged with power, except when he sings. Defunct is a hard funk-and-noise band that remembers the early 1980's. The sets start at 10 P.M. The $20 cover includes a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. JAZZ John Hicks   John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. John Hicks is an articulate, active pianist who always plays as if the present chorus is the last. He is to be backed by the bassist David Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis, which is an exceptional rhythm section. It is to be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show is to start at 9 P.M., and $115 buys a five-course dinner and Champagne. The cover without a meal is $25, with a $20 minimum. From 1 A.M. to 4 A.M., the cover is $20, with a $15 minimum. P. W. Michael White    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Michael White's New Year's shows are becoming a tradition, and they should be. This clarinetist leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's raucous, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the polyphonic group improvisations that bray and holler. The band invites listeners into a time warp and makes them understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. It traffics in joy. Sets are at 9:30, 11:30 and 1:30 P.M. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. P. W. Dennis Jeter Big Band    Dennis Jeter Big Band, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121.

The music will start at 10 P.M. and will not be stopping until after 2 A.M.; $150 a person includes a four-course dinner, a bottle of Champagne for each couple and a bagel buffet at 2 A.M. The $75 cover at the bar allows a listener to drink anything, all night long. P. W. Jimmy Witherspoon    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. One of the last of the great blues shouters is to treat an audience to classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which come with a blues nastiness to them. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and 1 A.M. There is a $25 cover charge and a $15 minimum, which will include party favors, at the appropriate moment. P. W. Big Band    George Gee, Metropolis, 31 Union Square West, at 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 675-0851. George Gee's big band is to be taking both upstairs and downstairs duty, playing for dancers and diners and cocktail drinkers. Upstairs, for $110, patrons receive a four-course dinner with unlimited Champagne, starting around 8 to 10 P.M. and staying all night. Downstairs, for $60, one can dance, drink at an open bar and eat hors d'whatevers, starting at 9:30 P.M. P. W. Saxophones and More    Gerry Gibbs, Ravi Coltrane, Mark Turner and John Swana, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 929-7565. The most intimate and relaxed jazz club in New York offers, for $30, food and drinks (no alcohol is served) and a group that includes two promising tenor saxophonists, Ravi Coltrane and Mark Turner. That is to start at 10 P.M.; at 4 A.M., Frank Hewitt on piano, Victor Gaskin on bass and Jimmy Lovelace on drums are to come on, and there's music, as usual, until 8 in the morning. P. W. Two Pianists    Hank Jones and Jacky Terrasson, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleeker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. A double bill of the smoothest pianist in jazz, Hank Jones, and this year's sensation, the pianist Jacky Terrasson. Mr. Jones is to be here with a group that includes the saxophonist Raph Moore and the trumpeter Tom Harrell; Mr. Terrasson is to be performing solo. The show is to start at 9 P.M. A full dinner, with Champagne and party favors, is $150. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $50 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Mance and Lightsey    Junior Mance and Kirk Lightsey, Cecil McBee and Marcus Belgrave, at Zinno's, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182.

The first show, featuring a full dinner for $29.95, is to start at 6 and end at 9. The second show, which is to start at 9 or 9:30 P.M., costs $90 and includes dinner and Champagne. P. W. LATIN Tito Puente   Tito Puente, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The percussionist and band leader Tito Puente is to spin his sticks over his head, dance a bit, stick out his tongue and egg his orchestra on to bigger and better music. He's a titan who understands the nexus between music and entertainment, and when he convenes a salsa orchestra, it's hard to find tougher dance music. The $175 package includes a five-course dinner starting at 8 P.M.; Champagne and breakfast at dawn; $90 includes appetizers, starting at 10:30 P.M., Champagne and breakfast; for $50, one can enjoy the music from 12:30 on until breakfast. P. W. On Broadway    Club Broadway, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-7600. For $20, one gets some of the better Latin dance music in the city, including the great Conjunto Clasico, the singer and whistler El Canario and the singers Ray Sepulveda and Tito Rodriguez Jr. It's a bill built for dancing, in a club perfect for dancing on a night made for dancing.

The fearless comedian, singer, actress, fashion maven and queen of ambivalence is emotionally mercurial, to the point that you're not always sure when she's kidding and when she's not. Who else would think to perform a furious riot girl version of \"The Ladies Who Lunch\" in the same set with a San Francisco reverie that includes a homage to Sylvester, the disco drag queen? Shows are at 11 P.M. and 2 A.M., with doors opening at 9 P.M. Tickets are $40. STEPHEN HOLDEN Do the Hustle    France Joli, Martha Wash and Vicki Sue Robinson, Expo Nightclub, 124 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 819-0377. \"Disco Space Odyssey\" is the nostalgic name for an evening of dancing and music. The club plans to feature a 45-foot video screen showing the activities in Times Square and three performers associated with the golden age of disco. France Joli, who is to go on at 11:30 P.M., was a one-hit wonder with her lush, dreamy disco ballad, \"Come to Me.\" Martha Wash, who is to go on at 1 A.M. scored her biggest hit, the humorous disco-gospel anthem \"It's Raining Men,\" with her group, the Weather Girls. Vicki Sue Robinson, who is to go on at 2:30 A.M., had one of the first and toughest disco hits, \"Turn the Beat Around,\" which was recently rerecorded by Gloria Estefan. Doors open at 9 P.M.

The stars of this promising triple bill are the younger generation's leading torch-bearers for old-fashioned pop-soul romance. Boyz II Men, the Philadelphia quartet that has led the revival of post-doo-wop harmony-group singing, has sold more than six million copies of its second album. Its latest hit, \"On Bended Knee,\" with its lush vocal blend and ardent plaintiveness, is as delicious a piece of ear candy as the genre has produced. Show time is 8:30 P.M. Tickets are $50 and $35. S. H. Angelina Reaux    Angelina Reaux, Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-8719.

Sanborn and Schuur    David Sanborn and Diane Schuur, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The most popular saxophonist after Kenny G, David Sanborn makes appealingly soulful music that begins with a rhythm-and-blues base and ripples out to embrace elements of world music and jazz-fusion without settling into the snoozy formulas that have given electric jazz a bad name. Ms. Schuur is a technical powerhouse of a singer whose style suggests a more formalized Ella Fitzgerald inflected with Kate Smith's clangy brightness. The first seating, from 7 P.M. to 12:30 A.M., is $175 at tables and $90 at the bar. The second, from 1 A.M. on, is $100 at tables and $60 at the bar. S. H.

Starting at 9 P.M. on New Year's Eve, each of the three rooms atop the General Electric Building in Rockefeller Center will have its own year-end celebration. Like an apparition from a 1930's movie musical, Tommy Tune is to strut down the staircase of the Rainbow Room at 11 P.M. and perform with a swing band led by Michael Andrews. The evening, which includes dancing to Mr. Andrews's orchestra, includes a seven-course dinner and costs $375 a person, not including beverages, tax and gratuities.

High points are medleys of songs by Henry Mancini and Harold Arlen. The evening, which includes a seven-course dinner, costs $325 a person. In a more rock-and-roll vein, holding forth at the Rainbow Pavilion after 11 P.M. are to be the Impalas, the vocal group best remembered for its 1959 hit, \"Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home).\" Dance music is provided by Uptown, an eight-member jazz band. The evening includes a seven-course dinner and costs $325 a person. The Promenade Bar will be open from 9 P.M. on and costs $50 a person. At midnight, Rainbow's Fellini Fantasy Parade, a conga line, is to make its way across the complex. No matter which room you choose, the setting offers the essence of Manhattan glamour. S. H. Mary Cleere Haran    Mary Cleere Haran, Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947. Mary Cleere Haran is something like a 90's Doris Day, but hipper and jazzier, with a feminist sensibility and an intellectual take on pop nostalgia. She is to perform her acclaimed show of 1950's movie songs, in which gorgeous renditions of songs like \"An Affair to Remember\" are accompanied by witty, sometimes barbed commentary on the Eisenhower era. Shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M., and there are two dinner seatings, at 8 and 10:30 P.M. There is a $45 music cover charge and a $30 food and beverage minimum. S. H.

The 9 P.M. show is sold out. The 10:30 P.M. show includes an 8:30 dinner seating and costs $190 a person. S. H. COMEDY Looking for Laughs   Comedy at Caroline's, 1626 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 757-4100. Heading the New Year's Eve bill at New York's leading comedy club is to be Dave Attell, a balding 30-year-old comic from New York whose who wears ripped jeans and a jean jacket and delivers a barrage of sarcastic topical jokes.

In the last four years, the city has routinely failed to place thousands of families as quickly as the state required, and as a result, state courts have fined it more than $5 million. Page 1.

Beginning with the Beatles and the British invasion and on through punk, new wave and techno, English musicians have picked up on an underappreciated style of music in America, taken it home, reshaped it and brought it back to the United States as something new and influential. But in the more than 15 years since America's first hip-hop single, England has yet to produce a significant rapper. It has, however, recently produced its own version of hip-hop: a popular inner-city music known as jungle, which was performed live on Wednesday night at the Cooler in Greenwich Village.   Top English M.C.'s like U.K. Apachi, Gunsmoke and M.C. Det performed alongside vanguard disk jockeys at the party, a celebration of the start of Jungle Sky, which claims to be the first jungle label in the United States.

The recapture of Grozny in 1996 played a part in the Khasavyurt Accord (ceasefire), and the signing of the 1997 Russia–Chechnya Peace Treaty.\n\n"},{"title":"Russian Ground Forces","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces","description":"Land forces of the Russian military","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Middle_emblem_of_the_Russian_Ground_Forces.svg/320px-Middle_emblem_of_the_Russian_Ground_Forces.svg.png","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":217},"abstract":"The Russian Ground Forces, also known as the Russian Army in English, are the land forces of the Russian Armed Forces."},{"title":"Battle of Grozny (1994–1995)","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grozny_(1994%E2%80%931995)","description":"1994–95 invasion of the Chechen capital by Russia during the First Chechen War","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Evstafiev-Chechnya-BURNED.jpg/320px-Evstafiev-Chechnya-BURNED.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":208},"abstract":"The First Battle of Grozny was the Russian Army's invasion and subsequent conquest of the Chechen capital, Grozny, during the early months of the First Chechen War.
