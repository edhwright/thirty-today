With the advent of music schools and the easy access to recordings, young musicians tend to gravitate to the same sources and the same ideas; idiosyncrasy is a long-forgotten notion. Von Freeman, the 71-year-old tenor saxophonist now at the Village Vanguard, is exactly that, idiosyncratic. He has lived in Chicago most of his life, and he sounds like it. His playing clearly has precedents, but in its distinctiveness, it can only have come from a place where jazz orthodoxy wasn't everything, where musicians had the time to experiment.   If the best jazz musicians have generally been able to muster the most resources, to bring the greatest rhetoric to bear on expression, then Mr. Freeman is a master. A solo of his, on up-tempo material, careens. He crams ideas into a short time then stops. The most noticeable element of his style is his manipulation of pitch, and he runs lines that seem to be paraphrasing some otherworldly harmony, dark sounds technically out of tune that slip quietly back into the normalcy of a tune's harmony. He pinches and squeezes notes, and lets them be soft for a minute, or hard for another. Sometimes he has notes run up his horn then lets squeals take over, howls that meander back into the realm of notes. And at times, he seems to be forcing three or four notes through his horn at once, a woolly mass that appears less as a pitch than just plain sound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940120","headline":"Doing the Continental : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/opinion/IHT-doing-the-continental-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Let us imagine for one ghastly moment that guerrilla fighting erupts among French-speaking, English-speaking and Indian- speaking Canadians, which very soon spills over into \"ethnic cleansing.\" The United States calls on its European allies for","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940120","headline":"Knicks Ransack Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-ransack-mr-robinson-s-neighborhood.html","abstract":"  The outcome was no surprise.

In those two pieces -- a Brahms Intermezzo (Op. 118, No. 2) and a Mozart Fantasy (K. 397) -- every phrase was articulate and refined; the pianissimos had a tactile presence. The runs and cadenzas of the Mozart were as lyrically played as the Adagio theme with its premonitory chromatic structure. Brahms's expressive lines and autumnal harmonies pulled at the ear. It felt as if the audience was eavesdropping on Mr. Lupu's private fantasies.    At his best, Mr. Lupu, a Romanian who first attracted attention when he won the 1969 Leeds Piano Competition, is capable of this kind of nocturnal yet crisp playing. He doesn't really seem to care if anybody is listening; he is playing as if for himself, giving the music an unusual immediacy. Mr. Lupu's stage persona reinforces the impression of solitude. He strides deliberately on stage, sits down at a straight-backed chair and gets down to work as if there were nobody else in the room.

The film that accomplishes this, Daniel Suter's \"Square of Light,\" comes from Switzerland and lasts less than five minutes. But with splaying crayon flashes, splats and swirls, synchronized with a soundtrack of thuds and crowd noises that vibrates with the dizzying sense of someone going in and out of consciousness, the film evokes brutal physical contact with a startling intimacy.   \"The Square of Light\" is one of several dazzling short films that make \"The 24th International Tournee of Animation,\" a 14-part survey of artists and styles, well worth a look. Like previous anthologies in the series, this one, which opens today at the Angelika Film Center in Greenwich Village, casts a wide stylistic net. You will find everything from latter-day descendants of \"The Flintstones\" and prehistoric cousins of the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" to a thoughtful Eastern European surrealism.

The cavernous Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 67th Street, is a drafty space in the best of Januarys, but this week's subzero temperatures and dry atmosphere have made the interior of the armory feel more like the windy Park Avenue corner outside. And the dry cold has led dealers to worry about possible damage to their delicate antiques.    In spite of the weather, however, the show may be one of the best in years, and is well worth bundling up for.  Now in its 40th year, this annual event, which opens to the public today and runs through Jan. 30, is the granddaddy of all American antiques shows. Collectors from both sides of the Atlantic make the pilgrimage to the armory; auction houses schedule their important American antiques sales to coincide with the show, and Manhattan dealers who are not participants hold special exhibitions to take advantage of the influx of buyers. The event has also spawned some smaller antiques shows, held simultaneously in Manhattan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"Come Monday, Islanders Hope to Air Out the Wash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/sports/hockey-come-monday-islanders-hope-to-air-out-the-wash.html","abstract":"  When the New York Islanders reassemble Monday after the National Hockey League All-Star Game break, Coach Al Arbour will be hoping for a transformation of Jekyll and Hyde proportions from his Atlantic Division cellar-dwellers.

This serious clown, who was mistakenly hailed as a \"new Bob Dylan\" more than 20 years ago, has aged more gracefully than almost any other folk-song writer of his generation. The comic edge of his autobiographical songs has grown more acute, with the humor barely outweighing the poignancy of songs describing an two-and-a-half-decade odyssey from brilliant brat to middle-aged sage and father of teen-agers. As his songs have deepened, his singing has strengthened. No one these days speaks more clearly and sharply for a certain class of privileged baby boomers.

Tickets are $17.50. <>STEPHEN HOLDEN Chinese History    Music from China, featuring Tang Liangxing, Washington Square United Methodist Church, 135 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536. This seven-member ensemble was founded 10 years ago by Susan Cheng and Wang Tien-Juo, a bass guitarist and a fiddler from China, to propagate public awareness of traditional Chinese music. They are joined by Tang Liangxing, a master of the pipa, an ancient four-stringed lute. Other members of the ensemble include Wu Man, on pipa and guitar; Wei-Laigen, from the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, on flute; Yang-Yi, a zither soloist, and Helen Yee playing hammered dulcimer. The far-ranging program will include everything from solo works for the pipa and ensemble versions of ancient music to regional folk music and modern composed music. Show time is tonight at 8. Tickets are $12. S. H. Sufi Sounds    Cinucen Tanrikorur Ensemble, Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 362-8719. A renowned Turkish lute player, composer and improviser born in Istanbul, Cinucen Tanrikorur plays Sufi and Turkish classical music with an ensemble that includes some of Turkey's most prominent musicians. They include B. Reha Sagbas on zither, Fahreddin Cimenii on lute and Dr. Mural Salim Tokac on flute. Joining them will be Hafiz Ahmet Calisir, a Koranic chanter and singer of Sufi hymns. The program will feature two closely related styles of Turkish music. One is the classical music associated with West Asian court life. The other is the Sufi music of the Mevlevi brotherhood, known in the West as the whirling dervishes. Show time is tomorrow at 8 P.M. Tickets are $16. S.

It's some measure of this film's tumultuousness that Andrei (Andrei Goutine), the brutish central character, takes solitary rides on a roller coaster in order to collect his thoughts and calm down.   The roller coaster is used to suggest the wild, breakneck trajectory of a society gone out of control, which gives \"Luna Park\" some common ground with Mr. Lounguine's earlier \"Taxi Blues.\" Once again, the film maker offers a startlingly vivid cross-section of a crumbling Russia, and strikes sparks off the relationship between an angry, musclebound anti-Semite and a dissipated Jewish musician.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"Seles Attacker to Face a New Trial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/sports/sports-people-tennis-seles-attacker-to-face-a-new-trial.html","abstract":"  The man who stabbed MONICA SELES is likely to go on trial again but no date for the proceedings has been set, judicial sources in Hamburg, Germany, said yesterday.

In response, Mr. Chernomyrdin's spokesman quoted him as saying the new course of reforms \"of course contains elements of Western market economics, but mainly takes into account the special characteristics of our state, people and Russian traditions.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940122","headline":"Review/Dance; Speed and Nuance, Speed and Daring","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/22/arts/review-dance-speed-and-nuance-speed-and-daring.html","abstract":"  George Balanchine's \"Sylvia Pas de Deux\" is associated with two expert technicians, Maria Tallchief and Andre Eglevsky, who performed the duet frequently. And certainly this little oddity of a duet calls for a strong classical technique. But technique must be used here in the service of lightness, charm and almost finicky detail. Danced to a wonderfully gooey ballet score by Delibes, the duet is all pizzicato and candied violet. It is a very French ballet, and Kyra Nichols and Nikolaj Hubbe captured those nuances in a performance presented by the New York City Ballet on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater.   Ms. Nichols's footwork was fast and sharp but always delicate, topped by a soft upper torso that was like oil over turbulent water. After a slightly rocky start, Mr. Hubbe relaxed into his distinctive blending of earth and air, traveling across the stage and turning in a way that dug into the floor and sailed above it simultaneously. He looked as if he were enjoying himself, too, and his partnering of Ms. Nichols was effortless.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940122","headline":"And Oh, How the Many Have Fallen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/22/nyregion/about-new-york-and-oh-how-the-many-have-fallen.html","abstract":"  DR.
