Hearst was in his 70's and Welles was in his 20's when they clashed. They operated in different worlds and their power was of different sorts, but as remembered here by Hearst biographers and Welles collaborators, both were strong-willed, controversy-courting revolutionaries accustomed to getting their  own way.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"Stepping Out of a Frigid House, Du Pont Heir Is Seized by Police","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/us/stepping-out-of-a-frigid-house-du-pont-heir-is-seized-by-police.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960129","headline":"World Cross-Border Acquisitions Rise 17% in 1995","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/business/worldbusiness/IHT-world-crossborder-acquisitions-rise-17-in-1995.html","abstract":"The value of cross-border mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures around the world rose by 17 percent last year, to $229 billion, according to a survey to be released Monday..The figures revealed a surge in buying from Germany and Japan —count","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"Strikes at 50-Year Low","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/us/strikes-at-50-year-low.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960129","headline":"THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;Along with talk about a merger with Sun are reports that Apple is pondering new  agency ties.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/business/media-business-advertising-along-with-talk-about-merger-with-sun-are-reports.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"Joseph Brodsky, Exiled Poet Who Won Nobel, Dies at 55","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/arts/joseph-brodsky-exiled-poet-who-won-nobel-dies-at-55.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"Shipping Label Called Key in Bombing Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/us/shipping-label-called-key-in-bombing-case.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960129","headline":"NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;Lifeguard Receives Probation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-lifeguard-receives-probation.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/nyregion/chronicle-061875.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"Equity Offerings Set for This Week","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/business/equity-offerings-set-for-this-week.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960129","headline":"Herbert Dow 2d, 68;
