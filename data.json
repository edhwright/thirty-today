A Tribe Called Quest features two rappers -- Q-Tip and Phife -- famous for their relaxed stage style and deft rapping. De La Soul has been notorious for years for their tedious live shows but the group has been steadily improving. They used to just stand there. Now they stand there with a lot more energy and showmanship. Both seminal hip-hop trios are riding on the crest of inspired third albums: \"Buhloone Mind State\" (De La Soul) and \"Midnight Marauders\" (A Tribe Called Quest). Doors open at 9 P.M. Tickets: $50.\nDANYEL SMITH\nHip-Hop History\n\n \"Old School Reunion '93,\" the Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 749-5838. For a real dip into hip-hop's early days, the \"Old School Reunion '93\" is the place to be. It features the rap pioneers Kurtis Blow, Kool Moe Dee and the original Treacherous Three, Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel and the Furious Five, Whodini, Biz Markie and the special guest host Doug E. Fresh. A truly historic event. Show times are 7 and 11 P.M. Tickets are $30, $25 and $20 for the 7 P.M. show; $35, $30 and $25 for the 11 P.M. show.\nD.

New York's own Marc Anthony had a semi-successful career as a Latin hip-hop artist but has recharged his career as the singer and leader of Marc Anthony and His Latin Band, one of the city's hottest live acts. Mr. Anthony appears with Sambasation, an eight-piece samba dance and percussion group. S.O.B.'s still has an after-hours package at 12:30 A.M. for $40.\nD.

The folks who used to groove and dance to Culture Club's \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?\" during the early 80's have given the lead singer of that defunct British band a second chance. And Boy George, all dewy and serene, is working it to the hilt. His plaintive voice is perfect for the regretful 90's. Boy George is appearing with the dance diva Robin S., and Scott Thompson from the television show \"The Kids in the Hall.\" Doors open at 9 P.M. Tickets are $75 and $50.\nD.

Gallery of Science and Art will present shows from its permanent collection, and will no longer offer the loan exhibitions that have made it a vital presence in New York City during the last decade. With such scholarly shows as \"Corot to Monet: The Rise of Landscape Painting in France,\" the splendid Tibetan showcase \"Wisdom and Compassion\" and highlights from several of America's treasurable smaller museums to its credit, the gallery's track record has been honorable, and sometimes a good deal more than that.   It ends, happily, in a literal blaze of glory with the filigreed, gilded altarpieces that constitute \"Sardinia: Sacred Art of the 15th and 16th Centuries,\" organized by the Italian Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Assets and the State Archives of Cagliari, among others. No doubt the light, reflective gold paint that covers these objects lends them a mysterious, numinous glow in dark churches and monastic interiors. But at least as mysterious for the visitor is the distinctive but hard-to-define collective flavor they project, a flavor that has much to do with the rocky Mediterranean island from which they came and where they still reside today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"Diplomatic Pact Signed by Israel And the Vatican","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/world/diplomatic-pact-signed-by-israel-and-the-vatican.html","abstract":"  Formally recognizing each other after decades of diplomatic aloofness and centuries of frequent Jewish-Catholic rancor, Israel and the Vatican signed an agreement today to establish diplomatic relations.

Presenting sacred objects in a secular setting, the exhibition is a groundbreaking exploration of a religious and cultural diaspora that includes altars assembled and consecrated at the museum.   On purely visual terms, there has probably been nothing quite like it. A \"bottle tree\" in the middle of one gallery is a tree festooned with colorful plastic bottles and frying pans, in the manner of Kongo-based shrines in the American South. A jerry-built closet contains a virtual forest and elaborate instruments of ritual, like mirrors and feathers, in a shrine constructed and consecrated by Felipe Garcia Villamil, a Cuban-born Palo Monte priest and artist, who now lives in the Bronx. Another altar, related to AIDS and put together by a Brazilian priest, Pai Balbino de Paula, presents rows of clay pots adorned with metalwork and sprinkled with popcorn, one of the foods sacred to the Brazilian Yoruba deity Omo-Olu. The final altar in the show is timely: a diorama representing Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro illuminated by candles, in the manner of a New Year's Eve ritual dedicated to Yemoja, the Yoruba deity of the Atlantic Ocean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"For Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/theater/for-children.html","abstract":"  'Art Machines' 'The Sculpture of Norman Tuck' 'The Discoverers'  Liberty Science Center  Liberty State Park  Jersey City  (201) 451-0006  Recommended for all ages    With Norman Tuck's sculpture \"Disco,\" children can see what it's like to walk forward and move backward simultaneously.

It will be hard to find a better party anywhere. The band, whether it's New Year's Eve or not, take the idea of carnival, of excess and celebration, to the limit. They'll play a weird hybrid of country, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll, with the Beach Boys and Sun Ra thrown in for some surrealism. They'll be joined by Terrance Simien and his Mallet Playboys, a rocking Louisiana zydeco band. There are two shows: the first, at 7 P.M., costs $20; the second, at 11 P.M., costs $40 and includes a Champagne toast at midnight. Both shows have a two-drink minimum. PETER WATROUS Classic Blues    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7902. One of the last of the great blues shouters will treat an audience to the classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which will come with a blues nastiness to them. Tickets are available for the 8:30 and 1 A.M. shows. There is a $25 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Zanzibar Guitar    Matt (Guitar) Murphy, Zanzibar, 73 Eighth Avenue, near 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Before this guitarist was saddled with leading the Blues Brothers Band, from the movie of the same name, he was an exceptional blues guitarist who made James Cotton's mid-1970's band rock. He's all speed and texture, and he uses whirling lines that can cause a commotion. There are two sets, at 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. , and $75 gets you a four-course meal and Champagne, while $35 lets you stand at the bar. P. W. Time-Warped Tunes    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. White, a clarinetist, leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's polyphonic, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the raucous group improvisations that bray and holler. He has become a New Year's tradition at the Vanguard, and hearing his band invites audiences into a time warp; it makes a listener understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. There is also a 1 A.M. show with a $20 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Piano Man    John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. He's a florid pianist who always plays like he's never going to play again, and wants to get everything he knows in by the last chorus. He'll be backed by the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Victor Lewis, who is one of jazz's greatest living drummers. It will be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show starts at 9, and for $120 there is a five-course dinner and Champagne. Before 1 A.M. there is a $25 cover and $20 minimum for the bar. From 1 to 4 A.M., the cover is $20 and there is a $15 minimum. P. W. Two Wily Veterans    Nancy Wilson and Gato Barbieri, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. Ms. Wilson can be a viscerally moving performer, one of the best singers to graduate from Dinah Washington's vocal finishing school. She can be smooth or rough and nasal, and both stances imply emotion. Mr. Barbieri is a showman whose best recordings, made in the 1960's, have a hard power. Tickets are available for the 7 P.M. show in the bar for $90. At 1 A.M., the $120 tickets include breakfast and Champagne. P. W. Ulmer Power    James Blood Ulmer, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. This year is Mr. Ulmer's fifth New Year's Eve at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes use of drones and odd tunings, is as distinct as anything that walks the planet. It's hard-rocking, slippery music, charged with power. Sets are at 9 and midnight, and the $20 cover buys a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. Dark Side Sounds    Stephen Scott, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, off Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. Mr. Scott is the most austere pianist of his generation, somebody who plays the dark side of every tune. The music comes out moody and emotional. He's anything but glib, and his sense of space is wonderfully Monkish, elegant and relaxed, yet taut. He's a young master. There are three sets, at 9 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. The $35 cover includes two drinks plus Champagne and party favors. P. W. Adderley's Band    Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best working bands in jazz features Mr. Adderley's cool sound on horn, and Vincent Herring's explosive soloing on alto and soprano saxophones. The rhythm section includes Rob Bargan on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums and it swings with authority. It's mainstream jazz at its most exciting. The show starts at 9 P.M. and $99 includes dinner, Champagne and party favors. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $25 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Visiones, in the Village    Cecil Brooks 3d, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-5576. Mr. Brooks, a good young drummer, always leads swinging bands, and this one includes the trumpeter Jack Walrath and the pianist James Weidman. Jeanie Bryson, a singer, will be on hand as well. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1:30 A.M. The first set has a $12 cover and a $10 minimum; the second, a $25 cover and a $10 minimum, and the 1:30 set has a $10 cover and $10 minimum. For $100, stay for three sets and have a full dinner and Champagne; $65 buys three sets, three drinks and a Champagne toast. P. W. Sharp in SoHo    Elliott Sharp, Nick and Eddie, 203 Spring Street, at Sullivan Street, SoHo, (212) 219-9090. Mr. Sharp, a guitarist and fixture of the downtown experimental scene, will be leading a trio that shows his roots. From 9:30 to midnight, he'll be playing jazz standards. At midnight he'll start playing blues. The $75 ticket includes a four-course dinner and a Champagne toast. P. W.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"Valle Joins Red Sox But Takes Pay Cut","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/sports/sports-people-baseball-valle-joins-red-sox-but-takes-pay-cut.html","abstract":"  Catcher DAVE VALLE and the Boston Red Sox agreed yesterday to a $1.2 million, one-year contract, a steep cut from the $2,366,667 million he made last season with the Seattle Mariners.

For Smithson, photography was by and large a convenient and unpretentious tool, a way of recording outdoor sculptures that could not be shown in a gallery, or of preparing proposals and sketches for projected pieces. But this show, organized by Robert Sobieszek for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, demonstrates that he used photography in surprisingly diverse ways, and pursued it with a remarkable degree of energy and invention.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"New Year's Eve Through the Ages","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/opinion/new-years-eve-through-the-ages.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"A Gift for a Brother","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/sports/sports-people-speed-skating-a-gift-for-a-brother.html","abstract":"  For speed skater KRISTEN TALBOT, a chance to help her brother live is more important than a shot at glory in the upcoming Winter Olympics.

Recently, an early Van Dyck, \"Portrait of a Seated Couple,\" from 1618-1620, was sold to an unidentified museum by the Manhattan branch of Colnaghi, the Old Master gallery, reportedly for $700,000. Old Master experts knew the work. The Detroit Institute of Arts sold it at Sotheby's in New York last January. But instead of calling the work a Van Dyck, the auction house said it was \"attributed to\" the Old Master, and it put a low estimate of $10,000 to $15,000 on the painting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/nyregion/c-corrections-279693.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article and an accompanying chart in Your Money on Dec. 11 about how watchdog groups rate various charities did not adequately distinguish between the Public Citizen Foundation, whose contributions are tax deductible, and its lobbying arm, Public Citizen Inc., whose contributions are not.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"The Surgeon General Has People Thinking","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/us/the-surgeon-general-has-people-thinking.html","abstract":"  From her 18th-floor suite far from the cotton fields she used to pick, it is becoming clear that Dr. Joycelyn Elders is not in Arkansas anymore.

Several were memorable, but the one that has made the 66-year-old Paterno into something of a taskmaster this time was last year's bowl game. At the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami, Penn State lost to Stanford, 24-3, and disgraced itself, according to the coach.    \"Never again,\" said Paterno.   So this year the coach swept up his players and took them to Melbourne, Fla., for a week, where he put them through an August-style regimen, even two a day practices, for three days.   Prepare in Melbourne, play in Orlando. The Citrus, with Disney World nearby, is renowned for its ambitious social events for the athletes, what coaches call distractions. Paterno even whined on Wednesday about the players having to stand around too long in the sun at one event. Laying Blame    Distractions were partly to blame, he said, the last time Penn State played in the Citrus Bowl, on Jan. 1, 1988. Clemson won, 35-10.    Then there is Tennessee. On Christmas Day, Paterno spent seven hours in his hotel studying tapes of the Vols. His suspicions were clarified.   \"They have more speed and quickness than we do,\" Paterno said today. \"On defense too, even though everyone talks about their offense. It is going to be very difficult for us.\"   Paterno drew a confirmation from Craig Faulkner, the Volunteers' wide receiver, who will be catching passes thrown by Heath Shuler, the celebrated quarterback. Said Faulkner of the Nittany Lions' defenders, \"They don't have a lot of speed, so we have to be ready to use ours.\"   Paterno dismisses the Fiesta Bowl contest of two seasons ago in which Penn State defeated Tennessee, 42-17, thanks to a flurry of turnovers by the Vols after they had built a 17-7 lead.   Shuler was a freshman backup to Andy Kelly and went into the game late, completing one pass. He emerged as a force last season and helped destroy Boston College in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla., 38-23.    Shuler, who is from Bryson City, N.C., will announce on Jan. 9 if he will return to Tennessee for his senior season or enter the National Football League draft. Pro scouts say he could be a first-round selection, the first college quarterback picked over all.   His counterpart here, Kerry Collins, the Nittany Lions' quarterback, who is even bigger than Shuler -- 6 feet 5 inches and 235 pounds to 6-3, 212 -- has considered the prospect of Penn State having to play catch-up. \"We have to be effective throwing the ball,\" Collins said, \"or we're in for a long day. They have one of the best defenses we've seen this season.\"   Collins approved of the Melbourne drill camp. \"It helped us a lot,\" he said. \"It gave us a foundation. Down here, we've been going everywhere.\"   Party time, distraction time. Now it's game time. EXTRA POINTS    All 72,000 seats have been sold, at $40 a ticket. Penn State fans bought more than 10,000. . . . Either TERRY KILLENS or WILLIE SMITH will start at inside linebacker for the Nittany Lions, replacing BRIAN MONAGHAN, who did not make the trip after being charged with public intoxication by campus security personnel. . . . The backup to KERRY COLLINS at quarterback is CRAIG FAYAK , the place-kicker, and after him it would be the punter, V. J. MUSCILLO . Why? Because Coach JOE PATERNO chose in November to save a season of eligibility for the quarterback of the future, WALLY RICHARDSON, who had not played and who was redshirted. . . . PHIL FULMER, the Tennessee head coach, played for the Vols in a game against Penn State at Knoxville in 1971. Paterno was then in his 22d season as a Nittany Lions coach and his team was a 31-11 loser.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940101","headline":"Review/Operetta; Slightly Italianate British Goings-On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/01/arts/review-operetta-slightly-italianate-british-goings-on.html","abstract":"  A half-century of operas in the Sir Walter Scott mode of melodrama are mocked in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Ruddigore.\" To the ancestral ghosts, innocent maids, evil baronets, disputes over inheritance and rejected maidens driven to madness, the score adds hints of Weber, Donizetti, Rossini and lesser figures, amid a swirl of English ballads, folk dances, patter songs derived from Italian opera, and a hint of Protestant piety. Modern interpretations also have to contend with more than a hundred years of performance tradition, largely drawn from the now-extinct D'Oyly Carte productions.   On Thursday night, the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players gave this mixture a weightless, sure-footed treatment that was thoroughly fresh, turning melodrama into froth without veering into camp.

The success was due largely to Albert Bergeret's accomplished direction and conducting -- this production is surely one of his company's crispest -- and to the accomplished singing of the cast, most of whom are familiar members of Nygasp (which is the acronym the company prefers).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940101","headline":"Fate of Trapped Dolphins Is Now Thought to Be Death","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/01/nyregion/fate-of-trapped-dolphins-is-now-thought-to-be-death.html","abstract":"  They have been around since August, a glistening, playful pod of dolphins that frolicked and fed in the shallow waters of the Shrewsbury River until it was too late: too late in the season for them to swim back to freedom in the Atlantic and too late for all of the bickering humans on the shore to agree on how, or even whether, to save them.

It points the way to the Elefant Hotel, named after one of the town's most famous visitors. In December of 1550, an Indian elephant was trudging up to the 4,495-foot-high Brenner Pass, 27 miles to the north. The animal was a gift from King John III, the Fortunate, of Portugal to Emperor Ferdinand I; it had been shipped from Goa, then a Portuguese colony, to Genoa, and was being driven through the mountains in the same way Hannibal's African elephants crossed another section of the Alps nearly 1,800 years earlier.   In Bressanone-Brixen the pachyderm's handlers let it rest for two weeks in the barn of the High Field Inn, causing a local sensation. The inn's owner, the postmaster, Andra Posch, at once changed the name of his business to Inn at the Sign of the Elephant and commissioned a local painter, Lenhard Mair, to commemorate the event. The fresco portraying the animal and its escort of turbaned Indians can still be seen on the street facade of the hotel's old wing. (The stoic elephant did make it to the imperial court in Vienna by late 1551, and would live another few years.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Revamping an Old Subway Station","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/neighborhood-report-union-square-revamping-an-old-subway-station.html","abstract":"  Built 90 years ago, the Union Square subway station has become one of the city's busiest, shabbiest and most confusing.

Renowned for his musical unpredictability and cluster bombs of notes played at numbing decibels, Mr. Guy was considered too wild and overamplified for the owners of Chicago's Chess Records. Consequently, he was either used as a sideman for blues elders like Muddy Waters or toned down for his solo recordings. Until the album \"Stone Crazy\" was released in 1981, Mr. Guy was considered a great live act -- he played the guitar with his teeth and behind his back years before Jimi Hendrix -- who couldn't be captured on record. Today, however, all that has changed. Mr. Guy is a Grammy Award winner, and his album \"Damn Right I've Got the Blues\" is considered a blues milestone. The book of the same name, DAMN RIGHT I'VE GOT THE BLUES: Buddy Guy and the Blues Roots of Rock-and-Roll (Woodford Press, 660 Market Street, Suite 206, San Francisco, Calif. 94104, paper, $14.95), an oral biography written by the music journalist Donald E. Wilcock with the guitarist's cooperation, is a frank assessment of the life, many disappointments and rare hurrahs of Buddy Guy. Suffering from lingering insecurities about his own abilities, Mr. Guy even today insists there are dozens of musicians who can play better than he does. At the end of this slim volume he tells of buying his son a guitar so that he could learn to play like Prince. Mr. Guy recommended that the young man also listen to Jimi Hendrix. After watching a film clip of Hendrix, the son called his father and said: \"He said he learned from you.

These affairs proved enormously popular, but what really propelled Mr. Norrington to fame was his personality -- alert, intelligent, funny, inquisitive -- and the way those traits came through in his performances. He certainly represents the post-Toscanini manner in conducting that has defined the late-century early-music movement: he makes music fleetly, dramatically and intensely, with more attention to structural definition than to sensuous subtleties of phrasing.

Outraged? Maybe. Amused? Probably. Thrilled, most likely, at its impact on sales. (That edition of the novel spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list this fall, including four weeks at No. 1.) Wharton was a fiend for advertising and promotion. At the same time, she was fiercely protective of her privacy and insisted on fitting her writing career around her active social life. Her first novella, \"The Touchstone,\" centered on the real danger a \"lady novelist\" faced of being turned from a \"person\" to a \"personage\" by publicity; yet, as she wrote it, she hectored her publisher for ever more ads. Between her demands and her demurs, Wharton became the very model of a market-wise, talented \"problem author.\" Her side of this relationship has been repeatedly described by her biographers. Here, I offer the publisher's revenge.\n\nWharton's editor during the early years of this fan dance with the public was one William Crary Brownell (1851-1928), a cultured and thoughtful literary critic who was as jealous of his privacy as any late Victorian gentleman could be. They were a good match: her insistence against his courtly evasions, his reticence against her social skills. Brownell was employed by Charles Scribner's Sons as its \"literary adviser,\" something like a modern executive editor. He and Wharton began working together with her first book, \"The Decoration of Houses\" (Scribners, 1897). Co-written with Ogden Codman, the architect who helped her to build a summer house in Newport, R.I., the book was an illustrated expression of their philosophy of tasteful, uncluttered decoration. As it happened, Brownell spent summers in Newport as well and his first working contacts with Wharton took place there. Writing to his boss, Charles Scribner, he left a record of Wharton at work that reads like a farce.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Exploring the Links of Color, Lines and Forms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/art-exploring-the-links-of-color-lines-and-forms.html","abstract":"  THE paintings hanging in the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford are as blithe as a flower show and some even include floral shapes.

I had spent $10 to fill up my gas tank before leaving the coast, which proved a good thing because there were only five service stations along the way.\n\n I liked the sound of \"Merida libre.\" In fact, part of the reason I was driving across the endless green scrubland of the northern Yucatan in an un-air-conditioned Volkswagen bug was because I had met a man on a beach on the Caribbean coast who told me Merida was cheap.

Every bit of bad news -- civil wars, military coups, drought and disease -- has sadly reinforced a mood of fatalism or still worse, callous unconcern.    Yet it is one thing to recognize Africa's economic and political ills, and quite another to let them become the pretext for doing little or nothing. Much that has gone wrong in Africa springs from causes beyond African control; that, too, needs to be recognized.

Then my mother told me about Ivor Spencer, of the Ivor Spencer International Butler School. He's British and comes to the United States once a year. That year, the course was being given in Washington. It was a monthlong course that cost $6,000. I stayed at the Y.M.C.A. for $25 a night; I had to pay for parking, food. \nHOW I GOT THE MONEY: I was working as a security guard in a hospital, making a lot of overtime. I had a Porsche. I drove over to Brooklyn, left the car there, went to a club, and when I came back the Porsche was stripped to the bone. My insurance company said the value of the car was $16,000; $10,000 went to the bank and I had $6,000 for the butler school. \nWHAT I LEARNED:How to lay tables; how to steam all the wrinkles out of the tablecloth; how to pack for a trip; never to wear cologne or jewelry; to be friendly but never familiar. He taught us how the butler can be the star of a dinner party without showing up the host. \nMY FIRST JOB: I met two executives who were hiring at the Renaissance Hotel, so I lucked out and got a spot making 30 grand. Butlers were something hotels were starting to use in New York. I was there for about a year. I hated it, so I went to the St. Regis, and it was a walk in the park.\nPROBLEM WITH HOTELS: You're forced to put on airs -- constantly.

Yet all through the century, people were racing and pouring into urban centers. In 1800, not one city in the western world had a million inhabitants, but by 1850, Paris did, and London had more than two million. By 1900, 11 cities, including New York, Berlin, Tokyo and Calcutta, had expanded beyond a million. Photographers, like all city dwellers, resorted to strategies to avoid the crowds: Eugene Atget, for one, would get up very early to find Paris pure.   Between about 1890 and 1915, photographers made three discoveries about cities that still influence urban imagery. One: that urban areas were dangerous and destructive to their inhabitants. (Jacob Riis's photographs of tenement life came out around 1890.) Two: that the undistinguished corners of metropolis and the life of its streets were piquant subject matter. Three: that urban geometries were the perfect modernist subject, and that rather than documenting the city's splendors the camera could cull abstractions and personal artistic statements from its surfaces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Bypassing Busy Highways Can Ruin Neighborhoods","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/l-bypassing-busy-highways-can-ruin-neighborhoods-755923.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   What was James Barron thinking about in \"The Road Wars\" (Dec. 19) when he directed drivers off highways onto the city's residential streets?

The melting-pot era of Studio 54, when everyone waited behind the velvet ropes together, evolved into a city tethered by velvet ropes of the imaginary kind. First, rap culture emerged; then, hip-hop and rave. The 60's were revived, then the 70's, and from the ashes of 1980's decadence arose Generation X, a group of young network television dropouts who didn't buy the traditional marketing methods used by magazines and advertising agencies.   From the start, Paper's independent, unpredictable approach to covering the arts, clubs, music and style has appealed to a young audience suspicious of the corporate world. That pull, it seems, is still strong today. \"There is this reaction in Generation X against synthesizing, Corporate America and artificiality,\" said Kim Hastreiter, who has shared the titles of editor and publisher with David Hershkovits since the magazine's inception. \"Paper,\" she said \"is not synthetic.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Small Steps to a Greater New York;\nWork Is Work Is Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/opinion/small-steps-to-a-greater-new-york-work-is-work-is-work.html","abstract":"New Yorkers argue about everything.

The collapse, which only a few years ago was typically triggered by nuclear war, is now more likely to be blamed on environmental or political mismanagement. Such stories tend to focus on what happens after the old social order falls apart; the ensuing chaos offers a heady freedom that tempts many writers to make up their own rules as they go along. In her fine new novel, PARABLE OF THE SOWER (Four Walls Eight Windows, $19.95), Octavia E. Butler accepts a more difficult challenge: poising her story on the brink of change, she tries to imagine a new social order at its moment of conception.   The opening chapters, set in southern California in the year 2024, depict a society that has continued to unravel from our own day but that nevertheless remains recognizable. The middle-income community where 15-year-old Lauren Oya Olamina and her family live has a high wall around it; the price that water peddlers charge to street people has gone up again; there's a new drug called pyro that prompts addicts to get their kicks by setting fires. But daily life by and large follows familiar grooves, and it takes an especially keen eye to see the great disaster looming.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"The Menu Wars, Continued","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-update-the-menu-wars-continued.html","abstract":"  The menu wars continue, but Empire Szechuan seems to be picking up the spoils.

As its name indicates, it is primarily a teaching institution at graduate level, but it also has in hand an exhibition program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"'In Spiritual Places, Mundane Problems'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/realestate/l-in-spiritual-places-mundane-problems-745073.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your Dec. 26 article, \"In Spiritual Places, Mundane Problems,\" suggested that the West Park Presbyterian Church was cut out of the designation of the Upper West Side Historic District because its rector was the most vociferous opponent of the inclusion of his church in the district.

If the tennis community has a conscience at all, there won't be any 13-year-old pigtailed, pinafored \"professionals\" available for exploitation in 1995 and beyond.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"DINING OUT;\nContinental With a Strong Italian Base","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/dining-out-continental-with-a-strong-italian-base.html","abstract":"SEEING a waiter taking a box of pizza into a restaurant kitchen does not inspire confidence in the chef.

But new studies suggest that a country like Bangladesh can cut its birth rate significantly if it aggressively promotes the adoption of modern contraceptive methods -- without waiting for the reduction that traditionally comes with higher living standards.   In what some experts are calling a reproductive revolution, birth rates are falling in countries presumably too poor for economic development that would stabilize rapid population growth, as it did in Europe and North America early this century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940102","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/realestate/q-and-a-723053.html","abstract":"  Interest On Security  Q.
