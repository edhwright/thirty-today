His husky, scat-inflected torch singing is at once dreamy and world-weary. His long-lined phrases and artfully slurred enunciation bring in echoes of Beat poetry.

Wearing a wig, a silver shirt and fake chest hair, and accompanied by a rock trio, she delivers a dozen of his hits, mostly from the 1960's, in a stentorian growl accompanied by appropriate fist-shaking and macho gyrations.

Her stylistic signature, especially effective in ballads, is her downward bending of notes to evoke longing, loss and the plumbing of inner depths. Her backup trio consists of Cyrus Chestnut on piano, Christopher Thomas on bass and Clarence Penn on drums. Shows are tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 P.M.

Most of the left and right banks of seats had been removed and stage platforms built surrounding the audience on three sides. Some 109 student players, who had been rehearsing for three weeks, were grouped into three independent orchestras, each led by a different conductor: Reinbert De Leeuw, Oliver Knussen and Robert Spano.   Then, for the next 22 minutes, in an extraordinarily virtuosic display of coordination and dedication, the swells and exclamations of Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Gruppen fur Drei Orchester\" (1955-57) swept around the hall. A clarinet in one orchestra was answered by a muted trumpet in another. A sudden percussive stroke simultaneously sounded in all three groups. Waves of marimba patter were followed by almost saucy, improvisatory responses. An electric guitar sprayed a riff at stage center; an enormous Chinese gong sounded off at the left; delicate, almost fragile harp pluckings came from the right. Fragments and fillips were passed back and forth; glints of Serialist patter were followed by tonal harmonies or jazzy roulades; intimate chamber moments were answered by bombastic proclamations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930827","headline":"YELTSIN AND HAVEL TRY TO BURY PAST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/27/world/yeltsin-and-havel-try-to-bury-past.html","abstract":"  In a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Prague Spring and the Soviet invasion that crushed the Czechoslovak reforms, the Russian President, Boris N.

On Saturday, Long Beach will play Panama, which beat Germany, 5-0, on Carlos Arauz's no-hitter, the fifth of the series. Burroughs, whose father, Jeff, is his coach and a former major leaguer, had 16 strikeouts for the second game in a row, meaning that only four of the 36 outs in his two no-hitters came by means other than a strikeout. The no-hitter was Burroughs's third in a row. He also no-hit San Ramon Valley, Calif., in last week's West tournament, then struck out 16 in an 8-0 no-hitter over Hamilton, Ohio, on Monday. He has not allowed a hit in 20 innings, but he can't pitch in the final because Little League pitchers aren't allowed to throw in consecutive games.

The home base of Shakespeare and Company, an organization devoted principally to the production of and training in Elizabethan drama, it is steeped in an atmosphere that is equal parts academia and bohemia. Snatches of blank verse float into the woodland air, as fresh-faced actors perform and rehearse amid stands of pines and on hillsides, and the views are truly idyllic. It all has the effect of making one want to be 19 and reciting something lyrical, preferably with a Gitane and a moody gaze.   There is nothing adolescent or dilettantish, however, about the work that is being done in the four indoor and outdoor spaces that the company has carved out for its summer repertory. Since assuming residency here in 1978, Shakespeare and Company, led firmly by its artistic director, Tina Packer, has created a strong, cohesive and sui generis language-based style in its approach to Shakespearean text, which stresses the relevance of the plays to audiences of all backgrounds. It is the company's credo that the beauty of the language should always be subordinate to its meaning, and that the meaning is topically evergreen. During the nonsummer months, the company takes its plays and its teachers on the road, into schools and community outreach programs throughout New England, and its function always seems to be to explain as well as to entertain. Perhaps as a consequence, subtlety is not the troupe's strong suit; clarity and accessibility very definitely are.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930827","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/27/style/chronicle-298493.html","abstract":"  The 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, was ratified on Aug. 26, 1920.

Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 7, 1992. The film opens today at the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, East Village.   \"Careful\" is the third full-length movie by Guy Maddin, an eccentric Canadian film maker who achieved cult status with his two earlier films, \"Archangel\" and \"Tales From the Gimli Hospital.\" Both were spoofs of early talkies that caught the look and sound of a bygone era while telling virtually impenetrable stories. Although \"Careful\" shares some of those films' obsessions, it is by far Mr. Maddin's most polished and coherent work.   The film is one long and amusing pun on German Expressionistic film imagery, Freudian psychology and quasi-Wagnerian storytelling, all carried to absurdist lengths. The plot concentrates on a star-crossed family of four. Zenaida (Gosia Dobrowolska), the beautiful widow of an oafish swan feeder, tends a home she shares with her three sons, Johann (Brent Neale), Grigorss (Kyle McCulloch) and Franz (Vince Rimmer).   The family's orderly little world begins to crumble when Johann, who has just become engaged to Klara (Sarah Neville), has an incestuous dream about his mother. Suddenly mad with forbidden passion, he drugs his mother, slits open her bodice and places his lips on her breast. Then in a paroxysm of guilt, he sears his mouth with hot coals, cuts off several fingers and leaps off a precipice.   That's just the beginning of the sexual Sturm und Drang that rises in the characters like an avalanche from within.    The movie's biggest strength is its knowing burlesques of antiquated cinematic techniques. Its biggest weakness is its acting. Most of the players, including Mr. McCulloch, the director's regular leading man, go about their chores with an amateurish enthusiasm that gives the movie a homemade quality.

The monodrama appealed to some 20th-century composers, like Poulenc, Strauss and Schoenberg, but in its prime, it had an almost popular following. A poem telling a highly charged and Romantic story would be declaimed, supported by music atmospherically commenting upon the tale. The monodrama was a sort of film score for spoken text.

A little wafting here, a little hopping there, and Isadora lives again. But Duncan's work is actually very hard to re-create. Hers is a technique of the heart as much as the body. And that was proved, once more, by a program presented by the American Heritage Dance Company on Thursday night at the Theater of the West Side Dance Project.    There was no mention in the program copy of where Maria Boscaino, who re-created the evening's 11 Duncan dances, had trained in that style or who her dancers' teachers were. The revivals relied a great deal on a rather circumscribed vocabulary of little skips with arms raised in a circle, small hops and quick arabesque jumps. After a while many of the dances began to look too much alike.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930828","headline":"U.N.
