Representatives from most nations have been searching feverishly in areas nearby the nine cities that will stage a monthlong tournament. It appears that only two or three have made firm commitments on their choice of training sites and housing.   United States   After games this month against Norway, Switzerland and Russia, the Americans will join three other finalists -- Bolivia, Colombia and Sweden -- in a tournament at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami Feb. 18 and 20.   The tournament will consist of a doubleheader each day, with the Americans playing Bolivia on the first day and Sweden on the second. The tournament will use the new point system adopted for the World Cup that calls for 3 points for a victory and 1 for a tie. The team with the most points wins the tournament.   Claudio Reyna, who led Virginia to its third consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association championship, has joined the World Cup team along with Frank Klopas of AEK of the Greek First Division and Dario Brose, who played in the French Second Division. He may play in Saturday's exhibition against Norway at Tempe, Ariz.   Reyna became the first player to capture the Missouri Athletic Club Sports Foundation award for the second year in a row as the outstanding player of the year. The talented midfielder from Springfield, N.J., won the coveted award yesterday with almost twice as many votes as he did last year. Through the Grapevine   Several of the 24 finalists are trying to schedule exhibition games before the tournament, which will start June 17 and end with the championship game July 17 in Los Angeles.   The United States, which will play its first-round games in Pontiac, Mich., and Pasadena, Calif., may play Greece at Giants Stadium in late May. Italy may play a non-finalist -- probably Japan -- also at Giants Stadium around the time of the United States-Greece game. Testimonial for Ukrainian   Romario of Brazil, Ronald Koeman of the Netherlands and Tom Brolin of Sweden are among several international stars who will play for a team against Sporting Lisbon in London tonight to honor Sergei Cherbakov, Sporting's injured Ukrainian star.   The 22-year-old Cherbakov is not likely to walk again after severely injuring his spine in a car crash in Lisbon on Dec. 5 following a dinner for Bobby Robson of England, Sporting's outgoing manager. FIFA Seminar   Coaches and representatives from the 24 finalists will gather in New York Feb. 22-24 for a seminar conducted by FIFA.   \"It will be a workshop type of thing,\" John Griffin, a spokesman for the United States Organizing Committee, said yesterday. \"We'll answer questions on how to do things before, during and after games.\" Ireland   About 20,000 Irish fans visiting the tournament will double as travel agents for the Emerald Isle. The fans will be given T-shirts by the Irish tourism office to promote Ireland as a holiday destination for the millions of American citizens who claim Irish ancestry and others.

If devil-may-care attacking play is his forte, his games that illustrate this will be the ones that get published. Yet some of his followers may finally begin to wonder what he does when he cannot brazenly walk a tightwire of attack.   Take Alexander Shabalov, United States co-champion for 1993. Like everybody else, the 26-year-old Pittsburgh grandmaster is bound to take his turn with the black pieces every other game in the tournament. And that means he must appear in the defender's role, despite his penchant for turbulent aggression. When he faced the California grandmaster Larry Christiansen in Round 9 of the title tourney in Long Beach, Calif., on Dec. 12, he took the opportunity to show that he defends well, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19940111","headline":"The Irish Government announces the end of a 15-year broadcasting ban on the IRA and its political arm Sinn Féin.","pages":[{"title":"Republic of Ireland","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","description":"Country in north-western Europe","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/320px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":160},"abstract":"Ireland, also known as the Republic of Ireland, is a country in north-western Europe consisting of 26 of the 32 counties of the island of Ireland.

Its five movements, each inspired by a character or situation in the Superman comics, have more the character of a suite of scherzos or lively overtures, or what are now called concert openers. Yet an American composer trying to make his living at orchestral music is hard pressed to write anything but concert openers, so the symphony's somewhat ad hoc character might be overlooked.   The more pressing issue is whether Mr. Daugherty has come up with a style befitting the sexiness of his subject. Although he produces a distinctive texture -- thudding ostinatos, quick-cut jumps and shifts, swirling glissandos, sirens and rimshots and the like -- his harmonies are curiously static, his rhythms more often insistent than incisive. Echoes of Sibelius's Fourth Symphony, Britten's \"Sinfonia da Requiem,\" Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand (heard later on the program, as it happened) and even Franz Waxman's score for \"Sunset Boulevard\" collide in strangely joyless fashion, and with the exception of the darkly glowering \"Krypton\" movement the music never seems to take flight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940112","headline":"Self-Esteem and Friendship In a Factory on Death Row","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/us/self-esteem-and-friendship-in-a-factory-on-death-row.html","abstract":"  The death row garment factory is humming at midday.

Most people, especially in New York, are conflicted about begging. Panhandlers can be annoying, menacing or pitiable. They remind the rest of us of matters we'd rather ignore, from poverty and deprivation to mental illness and drug addiction. What to do when approached by beggars -- give them some loose change to help them, or withhold money to discourage them? And what of the desire of the rest of us to go about our lives free of hassle and guilt?   Transit Authority officials have asked that question and they have offered up an answer: a crackdown. Don't give to beggars, they're telling straphangers; arrest panhandlers caught begging repeatedly, they're telling transit police.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940112","headline":"Camden Diocese Settles Sexual-Abuse Cases","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/nyregion/camden-diocese-settles-sexual-abuse-cases.html","abstract":"  Over the last three years, the Roman Catholic diocese of Camden, N.J., has paid at least $3.2 million to settle lawsuits charging sexual abuse by nine priests, it was reported yesterday.

As the film makes almost too clear in its climactic hunting sequence, preparing to kill an animal is much more than a sport for people like Wes. It is a rite of purification and a sexual substitute.

He made one classic album on Blue Note records in 1965, \"Basra,\" and worked with Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean and others, but then he fell off the face of the jazz world. Over the last decade or so he has been making appearances, and recently has led a fine group recruited from a revolving band of musicians. He had been working at Yardbird Suite; the club went under, and now he will be leading his band every Monday night for the next several months at Down Beat, a new club at 70 Grove Street, at Seventh Avenue South.    Mr. Sims (he used LaRoca as a stage name while working in Latin bands) is an exceptional drummer who combines the lightness of Billy Higgins's style and the rolling rhythms of Elvin Jones without sounding like either of them. He has a nicely cluttered sound when he solos; he'll hit the rims and the skin of a drum almost at the same time, giving his playing a chattery sound. And when he supports the band, he leans on his ride cymbal, making it swing with a light sizzle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940112","headline":"Officer Wounded and Man Is Killed in East New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/nyregion/officer-wounded-and-man-is-killed-in-east-new-york.html","abstract":"  A police officer was shot in the leg last night and an 18-year-old suspect was killed when the officer and six others responded to a \"man with a gun\" radio call and confronted the suspect in a darkened basement in East New York, Brooklyn.

By the time it was revived on Broadway in 1973 with an all-star cast of hissers and scratchers, it had acquired the unmistakable gloss of high camp. Now, the director Anne Bogart has taken the work to a third, perhaps unavoidable level in its life as a pop-culture artifact: She has deconstructed it.   The unorthodox production, which is playing at Hartford Stage through Feb. 5, is frequently surprising, occasionally illuminating and almost never funny. Ms. Bogart claims that \"The Women\" is part of her \"personal search for our American roots\" and reflects her enthusiasm for such popular American entertainments as vaudeville and musical theater. The operative word here is \"personal.\" The director has such an idiosyncratic vision of the script that Luce's contribution seems altogether secondary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940113","headline":"Astronomers Say Hubble Repairs Were Successful","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/13/us/astronomers-say-hubble-repairs-were-successful.html","abstract":"  Repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope have virtually restored its full vision, astronomers say, and the earth-orbiting spacecraft will soon be ready to undertake one of its most ambitious objectives: the search for black holes.

The Webern piece, brief as it is, even seemed to affect memories of the preceding night, when Parnassus, another of the city's neo-modernist groups, presented recent compositions at Columbia University's Miller Theater.    Webern must now be considered an old master, and this early piece, written in 1909, is not so ethereal and stringent as his later works. But the issues Webern faced throughout his life remained the same: how to create new compositional systems and sounds out of the wreckage of a long tradition.

Boehm turned the tables in the Team Player of the Year race, beating Smith by 25 points.   They were playing together on the diagramed deal from the Regional Knockout Teams during the New Year's championships, which concluded the tournament year. South's raise to two clubs was inverted, and therefore strong and forcing. He then pulled his partner's double of two hearts, a wise move since that contract would have succeeded.
