If the full Council approves the deal, as expected, Mr. Giuliani emerges as a master strategist. Facing a huge prospective deficit in the year that starts July 1, he set a few critical priorities and stood firm: Hold the line on total spending. Shave taxes. And slash the city payroll while preserving the police and fire departments' budgets and funds for classroom teachers. By fencing off those three categories -- half of all city personnel -- he forced deeper cuts in almost everything else.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940623","headline":"Watts in Benefit Recital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/arts/watts-in-benefit-recital.html","abstract":"  The pianist Andre Watts is to give a recital on July 3 at 4 P.M. at the Tannery in Mount Lebanon Shaker Village in New Lebanon, N.Y.

For Mr. Xenakis -- who was born of Greek parents in 1922 and lives in France -- has, throughout his unusual career, used exotic mathematical theories to help construct his compositions. And even for a music critic with mathematical training, the methods are confusing, with groups of notes ordered according to theories of probability or organized using mathematical objects known as Markov chains.

The atmosphere would be genial and festive, with dinner on the lawn before the opera. The repertory would draw heavily on contemporary works and neglected 18th- and 19th-century scores, with familiar works as the icing rather than the cake. The operas would be sung in English, mostly by young Americans. And the house -- the 950-seat Loretto-Hilton Center -- would be intimate enough for the singers to be heard and understood without forcing.   In 19 seasons, the company's budget has grown to nearly $5 million from $139,000, and the number of performances has grown to 30 from 13. Nine years ago, Mr. Gaddes handed the reigns to Charles MacKay, the general manager, and Colin Graham, the artistic director, and although they clearly have their own ideas about opera presentation, they have largely upheld Mr. Gaddes's original vision. This season's offerings are Gluck's \"Iphigenia in Tauris,\" Verdi's \"Falstaff\" and revised versions of two 20th-century American works, Conrad Susa's \"Black River\" and Leonard Bernstein's \"Candide.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940623","headline":"Youth Is Convicted in Murder for a Bicycle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/nyregion/c-youth-is-convicted-in-murder-for-a-bicycle-208795.html","abstract":"  A Brooklyn teen-ager was convicted of murder yesterday in the killing ofAllyn Winslow, 42, a drama teacher who was shot in the back last June as a groupof teen-agers tried to steal his bicycle in Prospect Park.

So there's the inevitable point, befitting a performance where the star wears pajamas, when her eyelids grow leaden and her head so heavy that she bumps it against a lamp. She wakens to recall a childhood dream that was so realistic it influenced her behavior in school the next day; its unfortunate consequences will be familiar to anyone who remembers the social mores of second-grade friendships.   The fact that any performance -- and life itself -- is a minefield of potential embarrassments provides both the form and content of this blissful piece of theater of abashment. The show \"101 Humiliating Stories\" (there are only 17, actually, but each has numerous subsets) is a chain of artfully paced narratives of excruciating moments recollected in, well, not exactly tranquillity, but with the modulated control of a master comic eternally poised between ingenuousness and irony.   Ms. Kron, who is a member of the theater troupe Five Lesbian Brothers, combines a novelist's sense of the telling social detail with a Chaplinesque knowledge of the humor in the yawning gap between intention and action (or, as she puts it, between the self you see in your mirror at home and the one that leaps out at you from store windows). She realizes, as she tells us, brushing a sheaf of papers to the floor, that there's \"a second set of behaviors that I exhibit to people that I am not aware of.\"   This premise infuses autobiographical tales that cover all manner of faux pas: stories of hair caught in school-bus doors; of \"geeky celebrity encounters\"; of fainting in the corridors of a Michigan junior high school in a green-and-white polyester gym suit; of speculating, with wicked specificity, on the horrific events that must have led to the abandonment of a sanitary napkin spotted near the entrance of the same institution and of walking down the halls of a business office with a skirt tucked into a pair of pantyhose.   All of the anecdotes, in fact, are spiritually akin to the sorts of dreams in which you find yourself naked before a crowd. They are linked by a series of scenes in which Ms. Kron imagines herself addressing her Lansing, Mich., high school reunion, explaining -- in styles ranging from cringing to confrontational -- both her sexual and professional identities. No alternative, of course, is safe when you're standing behind a podium.   The show, which has been artfully staged by John Robert Hoffman and was first presented in a rougher form at the Serious Fun festival last summer, is part of the Gay Games and Cultural Festival. The question of how Ms. Kron presents herself as a lesbian to the world at large (and particularly to her former classmates) is a prime source of the social awkardness she describes. But \"101 Humiliating Stories,\" at the New York Theater Workshop through July 2, is really for anyone who has ever had cause to blush. 101 Humiliating Stories  Written and performed by Lisa Kron; directed by John Robert Hoffman; set by Amy Shock; costume by Jose Gutierrez and Chip White; production stage manager, Janet M.

The film, which opens the Joseph Papp Public Theater's 1994 Italian Summer Festival tonight at 8:05, is remarkably similar in look and pacing to the Broadway musical adaptation except for one crucial difference. The character of Fosca, the ugly, ailing woman who conceives an obsessive passion for Giorgio, a handsome 19th-century cavalry officer, was softened for the Broadway musical.   The difference between Valeria D'Obici's movie portrayal of Fosca and Donna Murphy's performance is the difference between commedia dell'arte and Chekhov, between Margaret Hamilton in \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Olivia de Havilland in \"The Heiress.\" The scenes in which Miss D'Obici's bony, hollow-eyed Fosca throws herself at Bernard Giraudeau's dashing Giorgio lend the film an undertone of gallows humor. The character is a leering, voracious symbol of death. Ms. Murphy's lush voice and air of mournful abjection, deepened by Mr. Sondheim's yearning music, makes Fosca seem more romantically tragic than scary. The two performances are equally powerful in their very different ways.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940624","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/24/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"-.

It is obviously risky for the Security Council to approve a peacekeeping force that is viewed as a mortal enemy by one side in the very war the U.N. is striving to end. France insists that its 2,500 or so troops will not occupy territory but will only try to save threatened civilians for a two-month interim period, then turn over peacekeeping tasks to an all-African force.

The female quartet's first album, \"Sick 'Em,\" is dedicated to Ms. Sargent; its second, \"Viva Zapata!\" (C/Z), is dedicated to Ms. Zapata. With the recent death of another friend, Kristen Pfaff, the bassist in Courtney Love's band, Hole, it seems as if the group could spend the rest of its career dedicating albums to absent friends.   Understandably, when the band performed on Saturday night at CBGB, its rock-and-roll was forged from anger and hate, and delivered in the form of threats and accusations. It played dirty, funky heavy metal anchored in the big, sinewy bass lines of Elizabeth Davis, who writes most of the band's music. Selene Vigil's vocals were screamed instead of sung.

Stockton's father won the tournament in 1974 and is currently leading the PGA Seniors Championship at Dearborn, Mich., after also shooting two 66's. The younger Stockton had a bogey and five birdies to finish 36 holes at eight-under-par 132. David Frost shot a 68 for 133 and sole possession of second over the 6,820-yard Tournament Players Club at River Highlands. He was seven under after 12 holes but missed a chance to tie Stockton when he double bogeyed No. 4. Five golfers were at 134, including Greg Norman, who shot a bogey-free 65. Stockton, in his first year on the PGA Tour, has missed the cut in 16 tournaments and hasn't placed higher than 30th in the other six. Last year, he earned $64,214 to place 23d on the Nike Tour.

Candidates cannot win on the first round, however, unless they receive more than 50 percent of all votes cast.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940625","headline":"The Black Hole Called Cuba","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/25/opinion/the-black-hole-called-cuba.html","abstract":"  The people who make foreign policy in the Clinton Administration say that the \"enlargement\" of freedom is what America is all about. But there is a big black hole only 90 miles from Florida where Americans are forbidden to travel, on penalty of 10 years in jail and $250,000 in fines. Thus 200 U.S. citizens who this week began an illegal trip to Cuba are in the peculiar position of upholding America's libertarian values against a President whose middle name is Jefferson.    The trip is a legal challenge mounted by a San Francisco group called the Freedom to Travel Campaign. Apprised of its defiance, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets has blocked the group's $43,000 Wells Fargo bank account. This Treasury can do so because unauthorized travel to Cuba is unlawful under the Trading With the Enemy Act and the ill-named Cuban Democracy Act, which candidate Clinton carelessly endorsed in 1992.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940625","headline":"The New Consumer Plays Hard to Get","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/25/your-money/IHT-the-new-consumer-plays-hard-to-get.html","abstract":"A NEW breed of consumer is calling the tune for the U.S. retailing industry.

It was 1983, Nelson Mandela was in prison with no hope of release, and Mr. Martin, having just graduated from SUNY-Purchase, was performing with a troupe at Sun City, an enclave where South Africa, aspiring to world class decadence, stretched the limits of apartheid.

Three decades ago, the state decided that young lawbreakers -- who at the time were usually charged with misdemeanors like jumping turnstiles, breaking windows and stealing hubcaps -- should not face trial and sentencing in the same forum as adults, the punishment-oriented State Supreme Court.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940625","headline":"French Soldiers in Rwanda Report Finding Mass Graves","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/25/world/french-soldiers-in-rwanda-report-finding-mass-graves.html","abstract":"  French troops moved deeper into Rwanda today on the second day of their disputed expedition to save civilians from the murderous gangs that roam the countryside there.
