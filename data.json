The Staten Island home port means jobs and economic activity in a recession-strapped city. But its champions no longer have a convincing argument.   The Navy's elaborate and costly system of dispersing the fleet to every Congressional district with a port never had a strong military rationale and was always a classic example of \"port barrel\" politics. But the Government claimed that the country needed a network of naval bases for national security and established 21 of them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"The Price Of Tobacco: The Basics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/us/the-price-of-tobacco-the-basics.html","abstract":"  Ever since the Depression, the Government has lent tobacco farmers a hand by bolstering the prices paid to them on the market. But the farmers like to point out that unlike the growers of other crops whose prices are supported by the Government, they receive help that entails no net cost to the taxpayers -- that is, no \"subsidies\" in the usual sense.   The tobacco growers' boast, although accurate today, has been strictly true only in the last 11 of the 60 years since the Federal price-support program for tobacco was adopted. And even during this latter period, the Government has had to step in to bail the growers out once, in 1986. The cost was $1.1 billion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/arts/dance-in-review-573893.html","abstract":"  'A Tin Soldier on the Seashore of Jerusalem' Arie Bursztyn  The Kitchen","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/nyregion/c-corrections-550993.html","abstract":"  An entry in the People listing on the Media Business page on Tuesday about the appointment of James Putnam as chief of staff of Media Inc. misstated his previous title.

This House-and-Garden-meets-Thomas-Edison contraption leads a life of its own, narcissistic and almost nonstop in its efficiency. Indeed, as backdrops and props swoop, plunge, rise and revolve, a fatal tale of respiratory illness (to which Verdi attaches his tirelessly beautiful score) resembles increasingly the subsidiary and largely unread magazine copy with which editors surround their photo layouts.   Yet Thursday's revival at the Met offered a cast of players likely to give Mr. Zeffirelli some competition. True, Franco Farina's barely serviceable tenor tended to disappear behind the unbiquitous drapery; but if Alfredo was a wan presence, his Violetta on Thursday, Tiziana Fabbricini, is liable to kick up some controversy. Then there was Placido Domingo in the pit giving a report on his (considerable) progress as a conductor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Crenshaw Hits a Homer In the Bay Hill Gloamin'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/sports/golf-crenshaw-hits-a-homer-in-the-bay-hill-gloamin.html","abstract":"  Rolling his putts with a virtuoso's touch, Ben Crenshaw overcame a shaky start and later encroaching darkness to win the Nestle Invitational today.

And on Thursday evening, Mr. Costello and the group concluded a 10-country concert tour with a sold-out appearance at Town Hall.    The music of \"The Juliet Letters\" could not be described as \"crossover\" in the manner of Barbra Streisand's \"Classical Barbra\" or Kiri Te Kanawa's recent album of Michel Legrand songs. Its 20 compositions are collaborations by Mr. Costello and the quartet in which they explore a juxtaposition of musical genres that many assume to be antithetical.

The band, led by the bassist Chris McBride, and featuring the pianist Carlos McKinney and the drummer Clarence Penn, was at Bradley's on Monday night to enjoy itself, and Mr. McBride, syncopating lines so they took flight, was answered by Mr. McKinney's irregular, sharp taps. Mr. Penn, using brushes, might hesitate a minute, like a plane hitting an air pocket, suspending time for a second, then rush back in. It was musical wit, improvisational play at its best.   There wasn't much arranging to the show; the band, caught up in the storm, hadn't had a chance to rehearse, but that didn't seem to make much difference. Mr. McBride, at 20, is a naturally gifted musician, and each of his phrases has the sort of elegance that makes listening easy. At that age, musicians usually play with abandon, barely in control. Mr. McBride is strangely mature, an advocate of a new type of classicism in which each note has its place and the musician is in a secondary position to the music itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Abroad at Home; The Catharsis Of Truth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/opinion/abroad-at-home-the-catharsis-of-truth.html","abstract":"  In the 1980's the United States spent $6 billion supporting a Salvadoran Government that was dominated by killers.

Increasing the defense budget bought security during the cold war. It will buy much less if things now go wrong in Russia.

Doubleday. $19.95.     Both the themes and the characters of \"Poet and Dancer,\" Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's 11th novel, uncannily echo those of \"In Search of Love and Beauty,\" a novel she published exactly 10 years ago. Both novels concern the fragmentation of family life experienced by immigrants in New York. Both novels feature a similar cast of people, including gurulike charlatans who seduce wealthy women with their promises of salvation; older matrons who end up leading lonely, desperate lives, and the offspring of these people, who drift aimlessly through life in search of love and connection.   This time the reader is introduced to Anna and Siegfried Manarr, wealthy German immigrants who have made a home for themselves in Manhattan. Assiduously devoted to each other, Anna and Siegfried spend their free time going to concerts and art exhibits. Having come from families who have prospered in business for generations, they dream of having children with artistic talent.   Instead, their son, Hugo, becomes a sort of new-age guru who dreams of \"fashioning a new humanity.\" He marries a flighty woman named Alice, one of those familiar Jhabvala characters who travel the third world looking for meaning, and they have a pretty, high-strung daughter named Lara. Hugo's sister, Helena, meanwhile marries a wealthy businessman named Peter, and raises a shy, introspective daughter called Angel.   Angel and her cousin Lara meet briefly as young girls, and both vow to pursue artistic careers: Lara will become a dancer; Angel, a poet.   Years pass in which the girls do not see each other. Angel grows up to be a shy, serious girl, unhealthily dependent on her mother. Lara grows up to be a world-class neurotic and flirt.   Beautiful, vivacious and emotionally needy, Lara collects admirers and hangers-on the way a lepidopterist collects butterflies. One of her chief admirers is Angel, who quickly transfers on to her all her needs to be needed. Her other big admirer is Angel's father, Peter, who soon sets her up in a hotel room as his mistress.   Intercut with the incestuous tale of Lara, Angel and Peter are other stories of love and loneliness in Manhattan. Mrs. Jhabvala shows Helena compensating for her daughter's absence by befriending a superstitious widow from India named Mrs. Arora, who has lost her eldest son in a bloody fight in prison. Peter's mother, Mrs. Koenig, meanwhile, tries to compensate for    her    son's absence by befriending Rose, her new maid. Each of these friendships is supposed to make up for more conventional family ties, but as in so much of Mrs. Jhabvala's fiction, love breeds disappointment and regret, not solace and safety.   When Peter grows sick of paying hotel bills for Lara, he comes up with another plan: he decides to install her in an apartment with his daughter, Angel. Despite the protestations of her mother, Angel jumps at the idea, and she and Lara soon become inseparable pals. It's hardly a friendship of equals. In fact, the two women quickly come to resemble one of those infernal pairings found in so many of Anita Brookner's novels: Lara is the imperious, bossy, selfish one, constantly making importunate demands on Angel's time and attention; Angel is the meek, passive one, always eager to please.   Their hermetic relationship seems meant to protect the two women from the realities of the outside world, and it leads, predictably enough, to a dangerous mutual dependency. Angel abandons her poetry-writing; Lara abandons her dance. Lara actively tries to turn Angel against her old friends, and she begins demanding that Angel spend all her time at home. As Lara's behavior grows more and more erratic -- she starts stealing things from stores, and baiting Peter's wife -- Angel begins giving her large doses of tranquilizers. Confusion and hostility soon take over their daily routines and gradually infect the rest of the Manarr clan as well.   Mrs. Jhabvala writes with such fluency and poise that \"Poet and Dancer\" flies by with almost no effort from the reader. Her subsidiary characters, as usual, are delineated with deft, ironic strokes, and together they leave the reader with the pleasant sense of being immersed in a convincing fictional world. We are made to see the ways in which emotional needs and scars are handed down from father to son, mother to daughter, and we are made to appreciate the difficulty of erasing these patterns.   Still, the reader finishes \"Poet and Dancer\" vaguely dissatified and filled with a lingering sense of deja vu. The story of Angel and Lara feels mechanistic and predictable in the end: as young girls and later as women, they are almost completely defined by a single personality trait or two, traits that practically condemn them to their unhappy fates. Halfway through the book, we know where these characters are headed, and sure enough, we are given no surprises -- or further emotional revelations -- by the novel's end.   Mrs. Jhabvala has written similar stories before, and done so with considerably more complexity and insight.

He's not just \"rounded\" as his grandmother says, but overweight in the big-bellied, multi-chinned way of children who consume too many sweets and, in Zoran's case, plaster.   The boy has a compulsion to eat plaster. The walls of the family apartment in Belgrade in 1954 look pitted, as if damaged by small-arms fire during an insurrection. Zoran sneaks around the rooms and, when unobserved, peels back the wallpaper to stuff himself with a building material he finds as satisfying as meringues. It could be a sign of some kind of emotional as well as nutritional need. His ill-tempered uncle says it's a symptom of Zoran's degeneracy, pure and simple.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930323","headline":"Fading Breed: Fishing's Not So Easy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/23/nyregion/our-towns-fading-breed-fishing-s-not-so-easy.html","abstract":"  ALL Bob Gabrielson has ever wanted to do is earn a living fishing the Hudson, the murky big-hearted river along which he was born.

Anywhere he wants.   Well, almost. Norio Ogha, the president of Sony Corporation and an avid amateur conductor, will be on the podium at Avery Fisher Hall on May 12 at 7:30 P.M., conducting Beethoven's Seventh and Schubert's \"Unfinished\" symphonies and Strauss's \"Fledermaus\" Overture in a benefit concert for the Lincoln Center Consolidated Corporate Fund. His orchestra is to be billed as Members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, a freelance ensemble drawn largely from the pool of Met players.   But leading a freelance band was not how Sony had hoped Mr. Ogha would make his New York conducting debut. In September, Michael P. Schulhof, the vice chairman of Sony U.S.A., approached the New York Philharmonic about putting his boss on the orchestra's podium, but he made little headway.   \"I cannot comment on that,\" the Philharmonic's managing director, Deborah Borda, said at the time. \"But as a matter of policy, we do not hire the orchestra out, and if there had been any discussions, that's what we would have said.\" A Newcomer? Not Really    Actually, although Mr. Ogha's passion for conducting may at a glance look like dilettantism supported by corporate muscle, he comes to this avocation with a solid musical background. He took both a bachelor's and a master's degree in music from the Tokyo University of Fine Arts in 1954 and then studied voice (he is a baritone) in Munich with Gerhard Husch, the legendary German lieder singer. He earned another music degree in Berlin before returning to Japan and starting a career as a recitalist and opera singer.   \"But even then,\" Mr. Ogha said the other day at Sony's Manhattan headquarters, \"I wanted to be a conductor as well. I studied conducting, score-reading, composition, harmony and counterpoint. I also studied the flute and, starting when I was very young, the piano.\"   In the early 1960's, Mr. Ogha worked for Sony during the day and sang at night, but he gave up his double life after he fell asleep and nearly missed his cue in a performance of \"Le Nozze di Figaro.\"   But his work at Sony kept him in touch with the classical music world. From 1968 until he became Sony's president in 1982, he ran CBS/Sony, the Japanese arm of CBS Records, and in 1987 he oversaw Sony's acquisition of CBS Records. In the late 1970's, when Sony and Philips collaborated on the development of the compact disk, it was Mr. Ogha's idea that the disk be able to accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, at about 74 minutes.   Mr. Ogha began conducting in public in 1990, when he was 60, and has conducted benefit concerts in Tokyo and Germany for the Poland Relief Fund and a handful of arts organizations and festivals. He said he studies his scores every morning from 2:30 to 5. \"That way,\" he said, \"it's on my time, not Sony's time.\" 'A Great Feel for the Music'    Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, saw a video of one of Mr. Ogha's concerts at a demonstration of Sony's high-definition television system in Tokyo in August.   \"He was conducting the Schubert 'Unfinished,' \" Mr. Leventhal recalled. \"It was a very musical performance, very graceful. He obviously had a great feel for the music. So when Mickey Schulhof proposed his conducting a benefit for Lincoln Center, I agreed to it.\"   Still, one senses slight hesitation at Lincoln Center about the idea of a well-connected, enthusiastic amateur conducting on the institution's behalf. Several officials noted pointedly that the concert is a private, philanthropic event, not a Lincoln Center presentation. The proceeds are to be divided among all the Lincoln Center constituents, and David Rivel, Lincoln Center's vice president for marketing, said previous events have typically raised $200,000.   This one will apparently do better than that. Mr. Schulhof said that one of Sony's competitors, Warner Music, has agreed to contribute $100,000 and Sony would donate even more. Sony has also undertaken the task of selling tickets, at $50 to $100. Information: (800) 526-7669.   As for Mr. Ogha, it seems that in purely musical matters he is not entirely a company man. Asked which recording of the Beethoven Seventh is his favorite, he thought for a moment and said that it was Carlos Kleiber's, with the Vienna Philharmonic. On Deutsche Grammophon. Spoleto Skirmish    The Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the arts festival in Charleston, S.C., that seems constitutionally unable to get through a season peaceably, has already logged its first roster-altering dispute of 1993. John Kennedy, the festival's orchestra manager for several years and since 1990 the director of its 20th Century Perspectives series of contemporary music concerts, has resigned because of musical and philosophical differences with Steven Mercurio, the festival's music director.   The disagreement began when Mr. Mercurio, a conductor and composer, suggested that he and Mr. Kennedy share the direction of the three-concert series, which was the only significant exploration of contemporary music offered at last year's festival. Mr. Kennedy said in a telephone interview that although he objected to relinquishing control of the series, he nevertheless discussed some ideas with Mr. Mercurio. But when Mr. Mercurio suggested that works by several neo-Romantic and early 20th-century composers be included in the programs, Mr. Kennedy resolved to leave.   \"It would be impossible for me to forge casual collaborations of 20th- century music with you,\" he wrote to Mr. Mercurio, \"because I consider programming itself to be an act of critical importance. Among the composers you mentioned, I do not feel Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky or George Gershwin needs introduction or advocacy to audiences in the context of my series.\"   Mr. Kennedy added that he did not care for the work of several other composers Mr. Mercurio suggested.   Mr. Mercurio, reached by telephone in Washington, where he was conducting \"Turandot\" at the Washington Opera, said that as a composer he thought he should have a hand in the festival's contemporary component. But he insisted that he offered Mr. Kennedy concessions, among them allowing him a hand in the new-music programming at the parent festival in Spoleto, Italy.   \"He wanted to do a Cage retrospective,\" Mr. Mercurio said, \"and I was willing to give him that concert. It's not as if I was trying to wrest this away from him.\"   Mr. Kennedy said he did not think he had deliberately been pushed out of the festival, and both he and Mr. Mercurio said the festival's founder and artistic director, Gian Carlo Menotti, had no part in the fight.
