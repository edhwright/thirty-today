As far back as Shakespeare, observers of government have pondered this question. Now New York City's political journalists and citizens have reason to confront it as well. There is no question that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has provided direction to what often seemed a rudderless city government. It is equally clear that his centerpiece accomplishment has been the 12.3 percent decline in crime in 1994. The city's streets look and feel safer. Citizens and visitors have responded to that change in mood.   But there is now a disturbing sense that all the Giuliani administration's accomplishments are balanced on a knife's edge. There is no question that the Mayor is capable of winning a lot of battles, including ultimately control of the Police Department.

Alfred A. Knopf. $24.    The stories related in this volume are so odd, so perplexing, so philosophically resonant that the reader is immediately reminded of fictions by Borges and Calvino. We are introduced to a man, reminiscent of Borges's Funes the Memorious, who obsessively remembers everything about his youth in a small Italian village and who seems incapable of thinking about anything else. We meet another man whose memory has stopped in the 1960's, imprisoning him in a time capsule defined by early rock-and-roll. And we meet a successful scholar and businesswoman who attributes her worldly success to her ability to ape normal human behavior and who describes herself as \"an anthropologist on Mars.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950214","headline":"Workers Get a Union Label","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/14/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-workers-get-a-union-label.html","abstract":"  About 9,700 county court employees who are moving onto the state payroll under the recent state takeover of the counties' share of financing the Superior Court system will be represented for now by the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O.

The composers were probably uninterested in polemics; they were doing what composers have always done, grafting new sounds and influences onto their own languages. Exoticism was one of two topics explored in the New York Festival of Song's program of French music on Saturday evening at the 92d Street Y. The other theme, amorous misadventure, was also a mainstay of French composers.    Michael Barrett and Steven Blier, the festival's directors, presented several solutions to the problem of combining East and West. Maurice Delage struck a tenuous but fascinating balance in his \"Poemes Hindous\" (1912). The accompaniments sometimes approximated the sounds of an Indian ensemble, with a cello mimicking the elastic pitches of a sitar and violins supplying a tamboura drone. But the vocal melodies were unmistakably Gallic. Eugene Cinda Grassi, by contrast, notated traditional Thai melodies in his \"Poemes Bouddhiques.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950214","headline":"Gunmen Rob Tollbooths","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/14/nyregion/gunmen-rob-tollbooths.html","abstract":"  Tollbooths on the Queens side of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the Triborough Bridge were robbed last night by gunmen who escaped without firing a shot, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority said.

Now a U.N. tribunal has brought formal charges of genocide against the camp's commander, Zeljko Meakic, and accused 20 other Serbs of war crimes.    So far only one of the indicted Serbs is in custody. Others remain at large in Serbia or in Serb-held areas of Bosnia. While the U.N. tribunal cannot try them in absentia, prosecutors can present evidence against any of the accused who fail to appear and establish a record of their crimes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950215","headline":"Drop the Mean Mood and Keep Minding the Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/15/opinion/IHT-drop-the-mean-mood-and-keep-minding-the-children.html","abstract":"This article was written shortly before Mr. Grant's death on Jan. 28.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950215","headline":"New Team To Grow in Brooklyn?

On an average evening, in a familiar mainstream work, extravagant sets do not eclipse the singers; instead, they compensate for flaws. Vocal lines may be fragile, characters may be insufficiently defined, there may even be signs of sclerotic acting, but the sets leave no doubt that this is an imposing universe where much is at stake.    That much was evident, in this case, in the heavy draperies, the gilded decorations, the weighty mirrors, the flickering gaslights and the velvet, burgundy costumes. This production is as overstuffed as its pillows and cushions, but on Monday night it was just as well. There were a few nicely turned-out phrases and even a bit of effective acting, but for the most part, memory and image, not sound, made this performance work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950215","headline":"They Aren't Dog's Best Friends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/15/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-they-aren-t-dog-s-best-friends.html","abstract":"  At first, the view from the bridgekeeper's booth Sunday looked like something out of a picture postcard: a bridge over the Delaware River and a winter sunset with a man, a boy and a dog in silhouette.

Neither conductor nor orchestra has achieved a consistently high level of musicianship, but both are capable of great things when the spirit moves them.   You could say they are made for each other, although just the opposite might be true. The Israel Philharmonic digs into the music with great enthusiasm, but it does not possess a polished or precisely unified sound; it needs the taskmasterly attentions of an orchestra builder. Mr. Mehta, as New York Philharmonic audiences know too well, is no orchestra builder.
