But on Sunday, at a graduation ceremony, Richard M. Nixon will receive some measure of honor from the university: Duke Law School, from which he graduated third in his class in 1937, will publish in the commencement program a tribute by Dean Pamela Gann.   The memorial salute, which Dean Gann wrote on April 26 to send to Mr. Nixon's family, will serve as an alternative to the moment of silence that was sought in a petition from 105 (not counting the prankster who signed Henry Kissinger's name) of the 190 students graduating from the law school this weekend. An Uneasy History    Four decades ago, shortly after he became Vice President, the university offered Mr. Nixon an honorary degree, then rescinded the gesture because of an uprising by faculty members angered at what they saw as his history of nasty campaigning. Then, in 1961, Mr. Nixon turned the tables, rejecting a degree when the offer was renewed.   And in 1981, seven years after he was forced from the Presidency by the Watergate scandal, the university decided against allowing his Presidential library to be built on campus.    Against that backdrop of strain, the law school's faculty met yesterday to discuss whether to honor the school's most famous alumnus and, if so, how. There was no vote, Dean Gann said in a statement issued later; publication of the tribute was her decision.    \"The law school does not recognize the deaths of faculty, alumni or friends of the law school at its graduation,\" the dean said. \"An exception was made in this case because of the students' request and because President Nixon's death occurred so close in time to the graduation weekend. This particular method was chosen because the in memoriam statement provides a useful summary of Mr. Nixon's associations with the law school and his particular interest in foreign affairs in China, including the special efforts of the Duke Law School in the last 10 years to educate Chinese students about law and legal institutions.\"   Although the issue had not been the hottest one on the Duke campus, Kate Bartlett, senior associate dean of the law school, said some opposition to honoring Mr. Nixon had remained. \"It puts the law school in an awkward position,\" she said, \"where the failures of his life bear directly on our mission: the rule of law and the highest standards of ethics and accountability.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Baseball; Gallego Goads the Yankees With His Serious Thoughts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/sports/baseball-gallego-goads-the-yankees-with-his-serious-thoughts.html","abstract":"  When Don Mattingly addressed his Yankee teammates last Friday in Oakland because their play had occasionally lacked desire, Mike Gallego was happy to hear the critical words.

In its panic, the Fed has raised interest rates three times, taking everyone by surprise. Long-term bondholders have lost billions and international currency markets have been rattled. Yet the Fed's economists admit they can't point to even a hint of inflation in the current numbers. They are missing the obvious: the 90's are likely to be an inflation-free decade, and their interest rate hikes will squash the current economic recovery.    The 70's and 80's were inflationary times. The failure to raise taxes to pay for the Vietnam War led to slowly accelerating inflation that exploded with the oil and food shocks of the 70's. Inflation stubbornly receded in the 80's. If the effects of surging health care costs are subtracted from inflation figures, it is clear that more prices have fallen than risen this spring.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/nyregion/inside-001961.html","abstract":"  Israeli-P.L.O.

In City Center's lavish but bland concert production of the 1941 show \"Lady in the Dark,\" a beautiful but frigid fashion editor named Liza Elliott (Christine Ebersole) rakes through her past for traumas that might explain her inability to make up her mind. The story revolves around three elaborate dream sequences, stuffed with portentous Freudian imagery, that illustrate her repressed sexuality, her indecisiveness and her sense of shame.    \"Lady in the Dark\" revels in high-style Manhattan glamour, 1940's style. Moss Hart's book drips with famous names, chic references and characters gasping \"dahling\" to each other. Kurt Weill's delicious tunes, while retaining vestiges of the acerbic angularity of his German operas, well up with a giddy all-American buoyancy.

But many of the films are pretty good; most offer first-rate acting, and all of them provide, for anyone interested in Germany as opposed to German cinema, telling insights into what present-day Germans are fretting about.   Some of the Germans' concerns are specific to them: the reunification of their country and the difficulties that Easterners (\"Ossis\") and Westerners (\"Wessis\") have in comprehending one another; former terrorists coming in from the cold (a special interest of the post-1968 generation that now dominates German film), and the festering problem of neo-Nazi skinheads' violence and the hatred of foreigners.

In that time El Museo del Barrio has expanded first into storefronts on Third Avenue and in 1977 into the Heckscher Building at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, where its role has steadily evolved from a largely Puerto Rican organization to one that represents the art of an increasingly diverse Hispanic population to the rest of the city.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/style/chronicle-012408.html","abstract":"  A rare ray of happy news from the British royal family.

While legislatures, courts and special commissions dither over whether to sanction doctor-assisted suicide, desperately ill patients are taking matters into their own hands. The jury's eagerness to find any loophole to exonerate Dr. Kevorkian suggests an underlying belief that patients have a \"right to die\" with dignity and to be assisted in their suicides by a willing doctor.   That right got another legal assist this week when a Federal district judge in Seattle ruled that a Washington State ban on assisted suicide was a constitutional infringement on individual liberty. The issue, which is also being contested in the state courts of Michigan, may be headed ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court. Some 30 states currently have laws against helping people kill themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/arts/art-in-review-012920.html","abstract":"  Jock Sturges   Laurence Miller Gallery  138 Spring Street  SoHo  Through May 28    Three years ago Jock Sturges's photographs of nude adolescent girls made him the target of an F.B.I. raid in which agents, acting on suspicions that the photographer was producing child pornography, seized equipment, prints and negatives from his San Francisco apartment.

When Chuck Mangione came to Manhattan from Rochester in the 1960's, he and his brother Gap (Gaspare), a pianist, were leading a hard-bop group called the Jazz Brothers. The two brothers soon went their separate ways. Chuck Mangione played trumpet with Woody Herman, Maynard Ferguson and Art Blakey, and, switching to fluegelhorn, led one of the most popular jazz groups of the 1970's. For his appearance at the Blue Note, his first there in seven years, he will include a special \"Young People's Matinee\" tomorrow to which adults will be admitted only if they are accompanied by someone under 21. Admission is $20, plus a $5 minimum, for shows at 1 and 3:30 P.M. There are also to be the customary evening shows at 9 and 11:30 tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday night, with a $40 music charge at tables or $25 admission to the bar; there is also a $5 minimum at the tables and a one-drink minimum at the bar. Howard Prince Quintet    Howard Prince Quintet, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan (212) 582-2121. A broad range of influences come to bear on the trombonist Howard Prince's playing. These include such trombonists as his idol, J. J. Johnson, and his friend Jimmy Knepper, as well as performances on the bass trumpet in the Wagner \"Ring\" cycle with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. But it is the modal jazz emphasized by his mentor, the pianist and composer George Russell, that is, he says, crucial to his playing. His group, with the pianist Jon Davis, the guitarist Dave Moreno, the bassist Bryce Sebastien and the drummer Victor Jones, is to perform today and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. There is a $10 music charge at the tables or bar.  Carol Sloane    Carol Sloane, Fat Tuesdays, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Gramercy Park, (212) 533-7900. Carol Sloane's dark and husky voice burst on the jazz world when she was the unheralded star of the 1961 Newport Jazz Festival. Since then she has periodically disappeared from public view for several years and then renewed her singing career with a richer, deeper understanding of her art. She is settled in Massachusetts but makes regular visits to Fat Tuesdays, where she is to perform tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M.

She recently had a tough week. One day, she went to the aid of a neighbor whose son had been shot. Next, she pleaded with the leader of the gang in her building to hold off seeking revenge for the beating of a member -- she didn't want any shooting to start while children were coming home from school. The next day, she comforted the mother of a 14-year-old girl who had been shot in the head.\n\nHousing authorities nationwide have recognized that we will get a handle on violence only when we stop looking at projects as warehouses for the poor and start turning them into neighborhoods. But that is impossible when society's interest extends no further than protecting the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure -- a freedom that is an abstraction to parents who so fear stray bullets that they put their children to bed in a bathtub every night.\n\nNo one thinks police sweeps are the final answer. Everyone recognizes that getting a handle on the issue will involve tenant participation in managing and patrolling buildings. Many housing authorities are starting community policing efforts and focusing social service programs on particularly troubled projects. \n\nMany people, particularly Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, are saying high-rises should be torn down and replaced with low-rises or scattered-site housing. All this takes time and money that isn't always available. And it is hard to encourage people to act like neighbors when they're afraid to leave their apartments.\n\nFor now, the Chicago sweeps should at least clear away some fear -- sending the message that the authority hasn't abandoned the buildings and instilling some self-reliance and a recognition that a better way of life is possible. Plenty of Chicago Housing Authority residents will tell you that the day after a police sweep they feel freer than they have in a long time. There may be alternatives that accomplish the same purpose without running into constitutional issues. But if all we can summon the will to do is to tut-tut about excesses of authority, we will never find them.\n\nUntil we can look Brenda Bolden in the eye and say, \"This will make your life better,\" it is unprincipled to condemn people like those in the Chicago Housing Authority who have honestly been trying to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940507","headline":"Joint Military Games Supported in Russia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/07/world/joint-military-games-supported-in-russia.html","abstract":"  The Russian Defense Minister, Pavel S.

The nearly 30-year career of AMM, a British improvisational group that has been on a rare American tour the last few weeks, shows otherwise. Rooted in free jazz, AMM was famous at first for its association with Cornelius Cardew, one of the wild innovators of European composition in the 1960's and 70's. Its extraordinary first album (\"AMM Music,\" now reissued on ReR Records) came out on Elektra, with production help from associates of Pink Floyd. The group outlived its initial hype, survived Cardew's death in 1981 and has stuck to its esoteric avant-garde mission.   The core members remain Eddie Prevost, a drummer of extraordinary energy and inventiveness, and Keith Rowe, who draws the most unearthly sounds from an electric guitar laid out on a table. Their set on Tuesday night at Context Studios on the Lower East Side lasted about an hour; it ranged from minimal whispers of timbre to grinding, buzzing onslaughts. Mr. Rowe bent over the vibrating corpse of his guitar, manipulating metal implements and electronic gizmos. His favorite trick is to bring a transistor in proximity to the strings so that random radio transmissions show up like aural ghosts.

An asterisk indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above.   And Bear in Mind (Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest) THE BIRTHDAY BOYS, by Beryl Bainbridge. (Carroll & Graf, $18.95.) A lively, subversive historical novel that penetrates the stoic official heroes of Scott's Antarctic expedition of 1912 to discover the individual silly boys within. THE COLLECTED STORIES, by Grace Paley. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.50.) Three previous collections are combined in this volume that records, with a bright unsentimental eye and distinctive evocations of New York speech, the striving of Americans (mostly American women) for a better world. E.M. FORSTER: A Biography, by Nicola Beauman. (Knopf, $30.) What every general reader should know about Forster and his generally shackled life, occasionally punctuated by little bursts of liberation. THE FAVOURITE, by Meredith Daneman. (Knopf, $19.) Humming with rare humor and moral intelligence, Ms. Daneman's fourth novel is told in alternating time frames -- that of a girl growing up painfully in the 1950's and that of the rueful wife and mother she becomes in the 1970's. THE HOMELESS, by Christopher Jencks. (Harvard University, $17.95.) Mr. Jencks's careful review of the large body of accumulated research on the homeless contradicts the received wisdom of both liberals and conservatives; he proposes sensible discussion and incremental remedies.

A handsome collection of letters from a poet whose output was so small, and so good, that her every opinion and observation is more than welcome. PAUL REVERE'S RIDE, by David Hackett Fischer. (Oxford University, $27.50.) No rehash of Longfellow but a historian's careful account of the ride and the surrounding events, emphasizing the broad-based, communal nature of the Revolutionary movement in New England. ROALD DAHL: A Biography, by Jeremy Treglown. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) This deft, revealing unauthorized biography of the bullying author of children's books serves as an antidote to Dahl's own sparky but none-too-truthful image of himself.

Or so I recalled, having spent my student years at Mount Holyoke, one of the colleges -- Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts are the others -- situated around the town of Amherst, a veritable New England Oxford. I had often contemplated returning to the valley to sample the season's pleasures, but had been deterred by the price. Renting a car from New York for three days costs almost $200, and even if you take the train to Springfield for a mere $51 round trip, you need to rent a car to reach the Five College Area. Amtrak offers service to Amherst as well, but the train, on its way to Montreal, stops in town at 2:40 A.M., and leaves for New York at 1:15 A.M.\n\nLast month, though, I called the Peter Pan bus company and learned that the round-trip fare between New York and Amherst is $37.95, with about 10 departures a day. The Amherst Chamber of Commerce helped me find a small local concern called North Amherst Motors where I reserved a car for $29.95 a day, and provided me with a list of lodging options, including the venerable Lord Jeffery Inn right on the town common, with 50 handsomely appointed rooms that rent for $80 to $120. As I was looking for something less expensive, I called several bed and breakfasts in the area and booked three nights in three different private homes for $40 to $65. Then I packed jeans, turtlenecks and clogs -- if I could no longer be mistaken for a student, I could at least try to blend in -- and boarded the bus at the Port Authority Terminal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"Commercial Property/The SoHo District; Grit to Glamour: The Evolution of SoHo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/realestate/commercial-property-the-soho-district-grit-to-glamour-the-evolution-of-soho.html","abstract":"  OVER the last few decades, SoHo has changed from a district for light manufacturing to a haven for artists to a home for the poshest of galleries.

This is where the movie got interesting -- to me, anyway. The Girardot character was, you see, a mother as well. And she had not been home for more than a few days before her daughter was pleading: \"Mother! Will you please go back to work?\" (Or the equivalent, in French, of course.)

In her very pleasant EDOUARD MANET (Bucknell University, $95), Vivien Perutz explains that barely a decade later, the new avant-garde of Monet, Degas and Impressionism forever changed the treatment of outdoor light and of the significant detail of modern life. Ms. Perutz's generous scholarship shares knowledge and pleasure. The author, an English art historian, enrolls critics from Charles Baudelaire to T. J.

Above all, Manet's \"exceptionally acute visual judgment\" explodes with astonishing detail in more than 50 gorgeous color reproductions. In \"Argenteuil\" (1874), for instance, a young couple spend Sunday outside the city; Manet conveys the day's sweetness, luminosity and breeziness without a trace of effort.

They seem particularly valuable in cases of large-scale drug trafficking and terrorist thuggery.   But in the age of high technology, the wiretap is a dead duck. In the old days, all conversations associated with a given phone number were funneled through one physical pathway, and by spying on that pathway you could hear it all. Nowadays, cellular phones and call forwarding make it much harder to find the right spot and to attach a tap. New techniques coming into use will make it harder still: when many conversations are squished together and sent barreling over a high-capacity glass fiber, it's hard for wiretappers to extract the one conversation they are after from the resulting mush.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"That Pleasant Blur Is Bristol","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/travel/that-pleasant-blur-is-bristol.html","abstract":"A PENINSULA shaped like a lobster claw reaches out of southeastern Massachusetts into Narragansett Bay.

His books sent out a constant stream of reminders that the soggy old Serenissima was a good deal more than a beautiful corpse. For the past quarter-century, it was home to one of architecture's greatest living minds.   Yet the city's sumptuous decay provided an oddly sympathetic backdrop for Tafuri's lively polemical writings. His most influential books -- \"Theories and History of Architecture\" (1968) and \"Architecture and Utopia\" (1973) -- advanced the thesis that architecture itself was a beautiful corpse, an art form no longer sustainable in the modern world. Architecture, as he viewed it from his neo-Marxist perch, depended on a society's capacity to maintain a fixed relationship between forms and ideas. People could build cathedrals because the medieval social order was firm enough to insure that those looking at, say, a rose window would recognize it as a symbol of the Virgin's celestial powers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"DINING OUT;\nA Serene Spot Away From Hartsdale's Bustle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/nyregion/dining-out-a-serene-spot-away-from-hartsdales-bustle.html","abstract":"SET into a wooded hillside, Auberge Argenteuil enjoys an unusual situation -- serene and private, although busy Central Avenue is only a minute away.

The 1909 visit was characterized by incidents highlighting Freud's power struggle with his disciple, Carl Jung, and by a strange meeting with William James, another scholar skeptical of Freudian theory.

The evaluation teams are currently under the control of administrators at Board of Education headquarters.

Over the last month, Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell has issued subpoenas to 34 licensed ticket brokers in Manhattan, requesting detailed information about their ticket sources, their customers and their costs of doing business. The investigation, conducted jointly with the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, appears to be the most sweeping probe in three decades into an industry that has long frustrated lawmakers and ticket-buyers alike. Criminal Charges    State law allows resellers to charge only $5 or 10 percent, whichever is higher, over a ticket's face value. But brokers in New York and surrounding states routinely charge much more, a practice Mr. Koppell and others say limits the public's access.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"Korea's DMZ Opens New Areas to Tourists","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-korea-s-dmz-opens-new-areas-to-tourists.html","abstract":"  THIS may seem like an odd time to visit Korea's Demilitarized Zone, the fiercely armed no man's land of barbed wire and mines that separates South and North Korea.

That is a bizarre turnabout for a man who almost single-handedly bailed out the Clinton Presidency by rounding up Republican votes for a similar accord -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- over the opposition of House Democrats. Bizarre -- and wrong.    Mr. Gingrich says he is for world trade but against world government. He fears that the World Trade Organization, the oversight body provided for in the new agreement, would subject Americans to rules imposed by third world countries. But the W.T.O. would be more pussycat than tiger -- and would protect U.S. interests better than the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, which has governed trade for almost 50 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"Embracing Cape Ann's Contrasts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/travel/embracing-cape-ann-s-contrasts.html","abstract":"  MY first visit to Massachusetts' Cape Ann was on a cold, gray afternoon when surf detonated against the rocks, my scarf kept flying into my face and fishingboats pitched in such a forlorn way out in the harbors that it seemed impossible that anyone with a clear mind would want to live in this wind-struck, salt-struck place. Enormous granite boulders shouldered up against the beaches.  The ocean was the color of rain, and the wind smelled fishy. Ducking in and out of my car that day, I wasn't surprised that witches had thrown hexes on this spot, or that sea monsters had been sighted here by reliable witnesses, or that pirates had divvied up blood money on the rocks. Or, especially when I glanced up at the widow's walks crowning a few old houses near the shore, that thousands of mariners had drowned off this coast. Cape Ann, as far as I could see, had that grim obduracy that fosters both legends and bad dreams.    Two days later the ocean was silky, the sky was blue and Cape Ann was neat as a postcard and as far removed from witches, monsters and pirates as most romance novels are from real romance. Families posed beside a monument for lost fishermen; beachcombers bought candy shells from souvenir shops; camera-hung visitors wandered through art galleries that sell the sort of seascapes that have become more familiar than the sea itself. Water glittered behind 18th-century clapboard houses, which seemed only sweetly weatherbeaten. Even the rocks looked benign.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"WEDDINGS  <HEADLINEFelicia S. Rubin, Marc R.
