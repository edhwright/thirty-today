In standard news magazine fashion, there are snapshots and home movies of the pretty children before they were stricken, followed by grim hospital scenes. The reporter, Meredith Vieira, goes on to accuse the Federal Department of Agriculture of not doing enough to protect consumers from contaminated meat.   As journalists long ago discovered, nothing is more moving than the death of a child, and you can't help feeling for the parents who lost their children because a fast-food chain served hamburgers containing a lethal bacteria. The step from sympathy to indignation at officialdom for not preventing the deaths is easy.

The movie, which opens today at Film Forum, is narrated by Mr. Levy, the noted French philosopher, who also wrote the script. With its grisly images of children mutilated in the siege of Sarajevo and of emaciated Bosnian prisoners near starvation in Serbian death camps, the film, which was shot between September 1993 and March 1994, wants to prick the conscience of the world.   The Serbian forces carrying out their policy of \"ethnic cleansing\" are denounced as butchers and thugs seeking to establish a racist dictatorship.

Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said today.   The project, the first in the nation to dismantle a licensed commercial nuclear reactor, cost several million dollars less than the $186 million projected. Mr. Kessel said the authority \"got away cheaply\" performing a task that would eventually confront operators of more than 100 commercial reactors now in operation.   \"This is an historic day, not just for the people of Long Island, but for the country,\" he said at a news conference inside the former reactor building.   The plant, proposed in the mid-1960's, never went into commercial operation. Because of fears that safe evacuation of the surrounding area would be impossible in the event of an accident, the former owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, sold Shoreham to the state for $1 in 1992 in an agreement intended to block its operation.   Mr. Kessel said removing the radioactive waste that was produced during testing required 353 truck shipments of more than 5 million pounds of waste to burial and reprocessing sites in South Carolina and Tennessee.   The authority also shipped 560 irradiated fuel assemblies by barge from the plant, which is on Long Island Sound about 60 miles east of Manhattan, to the Philadelphia Electric Company's power plant in Limerick, Pa. The last of 33 barge shipments was made in June.   The pool where fuel rods were stored was drained and irradiated surfaces were ground away, officials said. They said no radiation above normal background levels remained inside the reactor building.   Mr. Kessel today signed a letter informing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that all radioactive material had been removed and other steps taken to comply with decommissioning regulations. He said he expected final approval from the agency by next year to lift all restrictions on use of the plant.   The authority has been studying a possible conversion of Shoreham to a gas-fired power plant.   Construction of Shoreham began in 1973. The plant was nearly completed by 1984, but public opposition to its opening and a lengthy dispute between the company and state and Suffolk County officials over emergency evacuation plans delayed issuance of a Federal operating license until April 1989.   By then the company had agreed with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to abandon the plant in exchange for rate increases and other financial compensation.    A Lilco spokeswoman, Elaine Davis, said today: \"It's been five years since we signed the settlement agreement. We are glad they have completed the decommissioning.\"   Mr. Kessel, who is also the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, said Governor Cuomo deserved credit for closing the plant. He said operating the plant would have cost Lilco customers, who pay among the highest electric rates in the nation, an additional $1 billion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/c-corrections-517100.html","abstract":"  A chart in Business Day on Oct. 5, about the effects of a 1978 law that requires utilities to buy power from independent generators, misstated the rates that New York State utilities charge residential customers.

But Russia needs to do more than sack a few officials. The currency debacle has been months in the making. To keep its drive to freer markets from stalling, Russia needs to turn its policies around, with help from the West.   Recently, the Russian economy has looked O.K. Inflation fell from 20 percent per month to 4 percent. The deficit, though large, was set at respectable levels. Stores have been stocked with plenty of goods. But the favorable signs masked problems waiting to explode. Inflation fell because the central bank drove interest rates to impossibly high levels that, left alone, would have crushed economic activity. The bank relented this summer, flooding the market with new rubles in an effort to bring rates lower.

Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar.   While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble; called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers.   Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21.   In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called \"Black Tuesday\" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an \"unmasking trial,\" the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era.   But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence.   \"I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors,\" said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. \"But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame.\"   Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market.   After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured.    Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.)    Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now.   During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar.    With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today.   But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies.   During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. \"Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises,\" he said. If the latter, \"the ruble will continue to fall.\"   Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded.   As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases.   Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation.    Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment.   \"Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen,\" Mr. Lindbaek said. \"In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold.\"   Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs.   Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: \"Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies.\"    Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. \"In contrast to the Russian Government,\" he said, \"the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you.\"   Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. \"We understand what has happened better than anyone,\" she said. \"We understand it with our pockets.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"When Opting to Insult Is Really No Surprise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/metro-matters-when-opting-to-insult-is-really-no-surprise.html","abstract":"  AT that now-infamous police rally at City Hall two years ago, the one that got out of hand over the issue of civilianizing the complaint review board, some speakers attacked Mayor David N.

But they said that they had been swayed by objections of the tobacco companies as well as by complaints from restaurateurs who said the proposed legislation would cause people to eat out less often and thus cripple their businesses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"Campaign Briefs; North and Robb Battle For an Edge in Virginia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/world/campaign-briefs-north-and-robb-battle-for-an-edge-in-virginia.html","abstract":"  With the latest poll showing Senator Charles S.

So it would be foolhardy to head off to the annual Young Playwrights Festival, which develops and then showcases the work of incipient dramatists up to the age of 18, looking for miniature masterpieces.   What you can expect to discover are individual scenes bristling with conviction, speeches that ring with earnestness, and feelings passionately stated (and sometimes overstated). This year's three winners, on display at the Joseph Papp Public Theater through Oct. 29, are nothing if not serious indeed. There isn't an escapist impulse in the bunch, which ought to reassure those who lament the deleterious influence of television on the culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/c-corrections-517135.html","abstract":"  An article on Oct. 5 about the Oklahoma Senate election referred incorrectly to the state's vote in the 1992 Presidential election.

The advertisement runs for 30 seconds and is being seen statewide. On the Screen: Reproductions of headlines and news organization mastheads, with announcer's voice in background. Producer: Gannon, McCarthy, Mason Ltd. Script: (Announcer) \"A Chronicle panel called her first ad 'slimy.' NBC labeled another ad the 'meanest, sneakiest' of the year. She was sued by the State of California for $8.3 million in massive financial irregularities. Her first Senate bill offered a $200 million real estate windfall The Register called a 'sweetheart' deal. And Kathleen Brown says Feinstein flip-flopped on the death penalty just to run for higher office. Feinstein -- a career politician who'll say or do anything to stay in office.\" Accuracy: The quotations are accurate in that they report the conclusions reached by the news organizations, but those conclusions were at least as subjective as analytical. The suit over financial irregularities involved sloppy, but not criminal, keeping of financial records in an earlier Feinstein campaign and resulted in a $190,000 fine by Federal election officials. Ms. Feinstein did change positions on the death penalty, but the change came long before she ran for the Senate, and Ms. Brown publicly corrected herself on that long before the Huffington advertisement went on the air. Scorecard: The advertisement is one of a several by Mr. Huffington that try to use what others have said to paint Ms. Feinstein as an opportunistic career politician who slings mud and goes out of her way to take care of special interests. From the start, that characterization has been the crux of the Huffington campaign.

On the Screen: Reproductions of headlines and unflattering words about Mr. Huffington, along with an unflattering photograph of Mr. Huffington that shrinks to a single dot. Announcer's voice in background. Producer: Morris and Carrick Script: (Announcer) \"The Chronicle says Michael Huffington is running a fraudulent campaign. Why the lies about Dianne Feinstein? Maybe to hide the truth about him. The Associated Press reports that government records describe Huffington as secretive, threatening and greedy. And Huffington's company falsified documents to cover up its violations of national security laws. His company stiffed taxpayers for millions. But Huffington still won't release his tax returns. Secretive, threatening, greedy. Congressman Huffington. The Texas oil millionaire Californians just can't trust.\" Accuracy: The \"fraudulent campaign\" conclusion was subjective, as was the accusation of \"lies.\" The quotations from the Associated Press were not based on government conclusions about Mr. Huffington but instead were opinions offered by Huffington business competitors in lawsuits. Huffington family companies have been fined by the Government for violating international trade regulations prohibiting overseas sales of law enforcement equipment, and some have encountered financial difficulties that resulted in disputes over tax liability. Mr. Huffington, a wealthy former Texan, refuses to release his tax returns. Scorecard: The advertisement is one of several by Ms. Feinstein that try to use what others have said to paint Mr. Huffington as a wealthy carpetbagger from Texas who refuses to come clean with his personal and business dealings, many inept and possibly shady, and thus cannot be trusted to serve in the Senate.

The first criticism appears true; the city wants to transfer health workers off the city budget in order to create the appearance of deep personnel cuts. But the plan also makes good health-care sense.    Merging city clinics with those the H.H.C. already runs is a smart way to bring quality health care within easy reach of the city's poor. City clinics focus on immunization and other children's preventive services. H.H.C. clinics provide comprehensive primary care for the entire family. In some neighborhoods, city and H.H.C. clinics are near each other and underutilized. A merger would cut the waste. The merger allows the H.H.C. to do what the city cannot: create a network of primary-care clinics throughout the city that are backed up by hospital facilities for patients who need specialists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"An Immigrant's Lifelong Journey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/arts/art-review-an-immigrant-s-lifelong-journey.html","abstract":"  Luis Cruz Azaceta left Cuba for New York in 1960 when he was 18, just after the revolution that brought Castro to power.

Cuomo PRODUCER The Garth Group, New York City VISUAL Mr. Cuomo, in a casual white pullover, talks to the camera with his wife, Matilda, seated beside him, her arm draped around his shoulder. The camera pans around the room to various Cuomo children and grandchildren listening as the patriarch talks about crime. SCRIPT Mr. Cuomo: \"We'll never forget when Matilda was mugged. And I still worry when my daughters are out alone at night. Crime touches too many of us. That's why we've doubled state prisons in taking criminals off the streets in record numbers. Now, I want to ban assault weapons and put career criminals away for life. But we also must give young people hope of a good future before they are seduced by drugs and money. We're making progress, but not enough. My job is to keep fighting to make life safer for all our families.\" SCORECARD Amid a storm of attack ads against State Senator George E. Pataki, his Republican opponent, this is Mr. Cuomo's first spot in recent weeks that focuses on his own record and plans. It operates on several levels. He lets viewers see his family -- a textbook trick for politicians seeking to seem softer or more human -- and says he has a personal reason to share their worries. He defends his record, which he has not always found easy because of his opposition to the death penalty. Finally, he says that fighting crime ultimately hinges on prevention, a message that sells big with his base of liberal and black Democratic voters.    Though firm, this is no war whoop on crime; the question is whether it is what most voters want to hear, especially from the incumbent who led the state during 12 violent years, despite three years of dropping crime statistics.
