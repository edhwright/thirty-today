The mail has its own magic, its own intriguing rhythms, especially when it arrives unaccountably in a distant place. Hardly anything adds more mystery and importance to a trip than the alluring words Poste Restante, Postlagernd, or even General Delivery on an itinerary passed along to potential correspondents. For trips a little closer to home, mail received at summer cottages near the sea or woodland resorts pleasantly interrupts the hot, lazy days, calls for a glass of iced tea on the porch and generates a tingle of excitement at the prospect of real letters -- from elderly aunts, or foreign friends, or kids at camp -- to be read and passed around. And when a witty postcard reports on a giant fiberglass peach or chicken or other roadside oddity, even mere weekend jaunts become travel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Wiring the World for Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/books/wiring-the-world-for-politics.html","abstract":"THE ROAR OF THE CROWD\nHow Television and People Power\nAre Changing the World.\nBy Michael J.

Composers have emerged from obscurity simply by virtue of their closeness to him. The most surprising case is Hans Rott, a fellow student of Mahler's who left behind an uncannily Mahlerian Symphony in E. Alerted by sentences of praise in one of Mahler's letters, musicologists retrieved the score, and recordings followed from Hyperion and Bis.   More significant beneficiaries of the Viennese revival have been Franz Schmidt, Alexander von Zemlinsky and Franz Schreker, from the brilliant generation born in the 1870's. Schreker's sumptuous Art Deco operas are appearing on the Marco Polo label, Zemlinsky's on Capriccio and Koch Schwann; Schmidt's four symphonies have been recorded by various ensembles. The repertory is even showing up in American concert halls; this week the New York Philharmonic will perform Schmidt's Symphony No. 4, conducted by the Austrian Franz Welser-Most.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/travel/c-corrections-577493.html","abstract":"  An article on Oct. 24 about the Austrian part of the Danube River misstated the location of Artstetten castle in relation to Ybbs.

As his dear friend Howard L. Bingham, a photographer, has said: \"He was born for the camera. . . . No one in the world has a face like Ali.\" For MUHAMMAD ALI: A Thirty-Year Journey (Simon & Schuster, $32.50), Mr. Bingham has selected nearly 200 black-and-white photographs from the one million pictures he has taken of Ali since 1962. The book, like its subject, is exceptional. It includes a fair number of ringside photos, but we also see Ali hanging out in Harlem with Sugar Ray Robinson and Roy Campanella; having his snapshot taken by Malcolm X and his ear bent by Jesse Jackson; playfully sneaking up on the ferocious Sonny Liston in a Miami bar in 1963 (even Elijah Muhammad picked Liston to win their fight the following year); and just generally having a good time, with folks sublime (Duke Ellington, Sam Cooke) and ridiculous (Sonny Bono, Don Knotts). When Wilfrid Sheed was writing the text for a picture book on Ali two decades ago, he pored over thousands of photographs and never came upon a single nasty one. Ali looks angry only once in Mr. Bingham's book, on the day in 1967 when he was indicted for refusing induction into the armed forces. Yet the man who had no quarrel with the Vietcong never seemed to hold a grudge against anybody, not even the bigots and boobs who kept him out of boxing for three and a half years and made sure that no one would see the athlete of the century at his peak. In the private, quiet moments depicted here, past and present, Ali comes across as too nice, too gentle, for bitterness. He used to brag that he could hospitalize a brick. He could probably get one to crack a smile too.

But the stars of the Italian Blue Team are all dead or retired, and the American teams are never quite as strong as they used to be -- or could be. The reason is that nearly all the teams that challenge for the right to represent the United States include a playing sponsor, usually a player somewhat below the top rank who is willing to pay a large amount for a chance to win a world title.    As a result, in recent years there have been no clear favorites and several surprises: Brazil won in 1989, Iceland in 1991 and the Netherlands two months ago in Santiago, Chile. The Brazilian team, cheered on by local enthusiasts hoping for a Latin American victory, came close in Santiago.

But because many historic towns were built on the bluffs and the big cities that draw the majority of tourists were fortified by flood walls, the rivers that consumed the bottomlands left most of the region's major tourist sites -- including the Mall of America outside Minneapolis and the Gateway Arch and the Anheuser-Busch brewery in St. Louis -- virtually untouched.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"All Mixed Up?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/books/l-all-mixed-up-568593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I suppose you've received bags of letters from the ones in millions who have or have had the \"disorder\" of synesthesia.

That and the residents watching anxiously as the garbage piles up and the rats return.   The lot, a large L that turns the corner and opens onto 100th Street, has been leased by a development group run by several local churches. With a little soil, some trees and a few benches it will become a small park designed by residents of the block and local gardeners in search of a place to wield their green thumbs. But the city finances that the organizers are counting on are mired in bureaucratic reviews.   \"I hope the city will loosen up the funds so we can go ahead,\" said the Rev. Robert V. Lott, chairman of SFDS Development Corporation, which leased the lot. \"It seems like forever.\"   The group has been working with a nonprofit group that promotes green space, the Parks Council, which has lobbied the city to include money to help turn city-owned lots in low-income neighborhoods into pocket parks.  This year's city budget includes $1.25 million for such projects, but the Parks Council is one of several groups vying for the money. And each site must go through the city's land-review process, including many public hearings, so the $40,000 to $50,000 that the garden is waiting for may not be available until spring, or even summer.   Karen Phillips, who works for the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which is involved in another planned garden, called the process frustrating but necessary. \"Unfortunately, it's slow, but it's set up so it's not business as usual, so people in the community have a say in what's done with the land,\" she said.   Depite the delay, Linda Davidoff, the executive director of the Parks Council, said she was optimistic that the money would be available. \"I think this is a perfect opening program for the Giuliani administration, because it takes an existing city resource and mixes it with a very tiny amount of city funding to make a substantial transformation in low-income communities,\" she said.   Neighbors on 100th Street try to match Ms. Davidoff's enthusiasm, but it is hard. The lot was cleared a few months ago, and the fence paid for with private money. But the fence is not enough.   \"Look at that garbage,\" said Charlotte Hodge, a longtime member of the Ebenezer Wesleyan Methodist Church, which is next to the lot. \"It wasn't here a few weeks ago.

El Pais has not only been a supporter of the Socialist Government, to which Mrs. Alborch belongs, but was also critical of Mr. Garin, particularly during his last days, when record rains caused conspicuous leaks in the Velazquez galleries. The leaks created a public scandal and drew hordes of gawkers. The episode seems to have provided Mrs. Alborch with an excuse to bring in her friend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"In the Far West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/nyregion/good-eating-in-the-far-west.html","abstract":"  CHELSEA CENTRAL ** (212) 620-0230; 227 10th Avenue, at 23d Street; $$; AE, MC, V","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Thrills and Chills","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/travel/travel-advisory-in-the-snow-thrills-and-chills.html","abstract":"  Moviegoers who were intrigued by the exploits of the Jamaican Olympic bobsled team in \"Cool Runnings\" can try the sport themselves at two public runs, one in the West and one in the East.

In those pre-Albers days (the late 1940's), the laborious renaissance technique was a required course. Alfonso Ossorio took it and passed the information on to friends like Paul Cadmus and Jared French, presumably before he himself segued into Abstract Expressionist painting and assemblage.    With the exception of Ossorio, these artists, whether or not they stuck with egg tempera, pursued the Magic Realism to which the medium lent itself. But in the marketplace, their art was soon eclipsed by Abstract Expressionism, the other child of Surrealism. Not until the 1980's was there a revival of interest in this chilly style of painting and Mr. Vickrey's show of recent work at the Greene Gallery in Guilford may be counted as a part of the revival.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Making the Yard Tidy Before Winter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/nyregion/gardening-making-the-yard-tidy-before-winter.html","abstract":"  THIS is the time of year when everyone likes to make their yards neat and tidy.

IDENTITY: Retired chairman of Bloomingdale's; 68-year-old president of Marvin Traub Associates, a consulting and retailing company.    NEW BOOK: \"Like No Other Store . . . The Bloomingdale's Legend and the Evolution in American Marketing,\" (Times Books, $25). The final chapters are devoted to Bloomingdale's period of bankruptcy after Robert Campeau took over its parent, Federated Department Stores, in 1988.    CURRENT CLIENTS: Ralph Lauren, American Express and Saks Fifth Avenue. Marvin Traub Associates also owns Conran's Habitat, the chain of home furnishing stores.    Q.  Do you still shop at Bloomingdale's?    A.  I was there about 10 days ago. I was in the men's store and I ordered some shirts.    Q.  But you don't have to be loyal anymore, do you?   A.  I also shop at Saks as well as Paul Stuart. When I was at Bloomingdale's, 90 percent of my purchases were there, as were Mrs. Traub's. I had a rule: she could shop anyplace she wanted as long as she bought at Bloomingdale's.   Q.  What have you been up to since leaving in 1991?    A.  I've worked with QVC. I originally took Diane Von Furstenburg to QVC, as I say in the book, and through Diane, Barry Diller became very much involved. I've brought a number of different projects to them, including Barbara Taylor Bradford. When it was a great success, the folks at QVC said, \"Marvin, when your book comes out, we'll work together with you on it.\"   Q.  So you're planning to go on the air to sell it?   A.  Yes. It will probably happen sometime in early December.    Q.  Hasn't QVC had too much hype though?   A.  It's interesting to think that the total volume of QVC, Home Shopping Network and all the infomercials that are made is a little more than 15 percent of J. C. Penney's sales. It is a very tiny business, but it will grow. It will not replace people going into department stores or shopping centers.   Q.  What else are you doing?   A.  We started a business with Elizabeth Taylor for costume jewelry, which Avon is making. It's being launched this month. We have another company we started up with Iman, the model. We are doing a line of cosmetics and skin care for women of color.    Q.  What do you think of the direction of Bloomingdale's since you left?   A.  I think I have made it plain in the book that I have a concern that Bloomingdale's maintain a level of uniqueness that excited people to shop there. I know there's an enormous profit pressure that makes it hard to do either a country promotion or some major new idea.    Q.  What do you mean \"concern\"?    A.  The emphasis is on other things. I'm being very measured because I really don't want to seem like sour grapes.    Q.  You do say in the book that you didn't like Michael Gould, your successor as chairman.    A.  Mike was not my first choice for the job, but Mike does have the job, so I'd like him to be successful. For the sake of all the people there and everything we've built.    Q.  You don't mince words about Robert Campeau either. You even imply that he cheats at golf.    A.  He was just driven to win at most any cost. He had some sound ideas and some excesses.    Q.  Having once tried to lead a management buyout of Bloomingdale's, are you disappointedthat you don't own the store?   A.  No. I loved running Bloomingdale's, but with this new second career I am as busy as I've ever been.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"The Renaissance Of an Art Form","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/coins-the-renaissance-of-an-art-form.html","abstract":"  MEDALLIC sculpture began as an art form in Europe during the Renaissance, but since then it's never risen to a position of much prominence.

When the City Council denied landmark status to Dvorak's home in 1991, there was considerable opposition, including appeals from world figures like Vaclav Havel, then the President of Czechoslovakia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Cracking the Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/cracking-the-case.html","abstract":"NOTHING is more annoying than discovering that an elegant design solution isn't.

Its mountain spine, still draped in darkness, falls sharply to the sea; a minute or two later, strengthening sunlight makes shadow play of the scene -- curving coast, fingers of land, sprinklings of islands all rippling across the glaring screen of the Hauraki Gulf until the plane swoops in over Auckland's morning traffic.\n\nOnce on the ground, foreign travelers tend to bypass the Coromandel Peninsula. But its compact mix of west coast harbors and east side sand, with forest trails, volcanic pinnacles, waterfalls and damp gorges in between, make it a favorite among New Zealanders, who consider it one of their most scenic regions. That endorsement -- impressive considering the country's better-known contenders -- led my husband, Gregory Foote, and me to the peninsula eight years ago, when we stopped for a few days in New Zealand on a two-month round-the-world blitz. We were newlyweds, traveling light; but this year, on our third trip to New Zealand, the peninsula's proximity to Auckland -- about a two-hour drive away -- made it a prime draw for us and our two little boys. So did the Coromandel's unusual, sometime subtle layerings of natural and human history, best uncovered at a pace that leaves plenty of time for serendipity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Trade Pact Offers Chance to Export Our Ideals; A Bleak Future Looms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/opinion/l-trade-pact-offers-chance-to-export-our-ideals-a-bleak-future-looms-953993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a very longtime reader, I do not believe I have ever seen you use such a tone as that in \"Running Scared From Nafta\" (editorial, Nov. 16).

Wars and civil wars that no one seems to have the power or determination to stop -- in the former Yugoslavia, in Georgia and Azerbaijan, in Northern Ireland, in Nigeria -- continue unabated. And what might be called the undeclared wars in our cities, from Los Angeles to Johannesburg, also spiral out of control. \n\nI do not have a solution to this pervasive manifestation of violence. But it seems to me that if we frame our idea of violence as an aberration, a deviation from the path of normality, we are making a profound error. We run the risk of unwittingly justifying neglect of whole segments of society while ignoring the increasing power of violence generated by society itself, which in modern life increasingly seems to isolate and brutalize the individual. We cannot hope to solve the problem of escalating violence until we have redefined the concept of violence and changed our perception of it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931121","headline":"Recreating A Spirit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/21/style/on-the-street-recreating-a-spirit.html","abstract":"  There's a playfulness that comes with the last days of fall, when coats are discarded to catch the last rays of Indian summer.

The city's historic center is one of the biggest in Europe, and the only one where bomb damage from World War II is still to be found. Heaps of decaying garbage molder next to heaps of decaying stone; crumbling churches and palaces punctuate the Levantine hurly-burly of street markets with their piles of brilliantly colored fish and vegetables, their canvas awnings framing a medieval tower or the iron gratings of a 17th-century convent; dark and lonely alleys are crisscrossed by wooden beams that prop up tottering houses where -- often despite doors sealed by the town government -- clandestine immigrants from the third world exercise squatters' rights.   Cautious tourists dart in from the main thoroughfares just far enough and long enough to visit the neighborhood's churches and museums; food enthusiasts brave the push-and-shove to admire the spectacular displays of the markets and ponder the unfamiliar produce; the adventurous attempt to pursue an itinerary through the maze of narrow streets, or simply wander where they fancy. But everyone, whether fueled by esthetic, gastronomic or sociological curiosity, comes up against padlocked gates and unanswered questions.

On its face, this reciprocal violence appeared to doom a new peace initiative aimed at drawing Sinn Fein and its leader, Gerry Adams, into talks.

Oil prices soared after a cold winter in 1989-90 and the Persian Gulf war in 1990-91 but two warm winters back to back have brought them back down. Prices also vary by region because of differences in local business costs, transportation and competition.

His honey-cured baritone is at home in honky-tonk songs about drinking away the pain of a breakup or getting through the morning after the binge. But he also dispenses sentimental ballads and Billy Joel-style bombast. And even in traditionalist country and Cajun songs, his band members pose, swinging their guitars in synch, like video-trained arena rockers; they even brought strobe lights to Tramps.

The idea was straightforward enough: to bring the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band together with some soloists to perform works taken from the vast array of material churned out by pre-rock pop songwriters.   The choice of guests was less than inspired, the material they performed wasn't much better, and the performances themselves seemed dispirited. In addition, the choice of soloists, particularly the 20-year-old trumpeter Ryan Kisor and the 12-year-old pianist Sergio Salvatore, both of whom have new records out, gave the impression that Carnegie Hall was putting the needs of record companies before the music they should be presenting. Neither of the two have a voice yet, and that's being kind about it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931122","headline":"Defense Department Fuels the Giants' Machine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/22/sports/pro-football-defense-department-fuels-the-giants-machine.html","abstract":"  How good was the Giants' defense in today's 7-3 victory over the Eagles?   \"A great defensive effort,\" said Coach Dan Reeves of the Giants.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931122","headline":"Books of The Times; What Made Allard Lowenstein Run: A Psychological Portrait","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/22/books/books-of-the-times-what-made-allard-lowenstein-run-a-psychological-portrait.html","abstract":"  Never Stop Running  Allard Lowenstein and the Struggle to Save American Liberalism  By William H.

Bantam Books. $22.95.     Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third President of the United States, presents the historical novelist with several problems. To begin with, the historical record concerning Jefferson is enormous, as the bulk of Jefferson's own eloquent writings and Dumas Malone's minutely detailed six-volume biography attests. Jefferson's life does not provide a lot of room for novelistic improvisation.   Furthermore, the highly rational, practical-minded Jefferson does not immediately present the novelist with a particularly colorful or emotionally sympathetic canvas. While no one would contest Jefferson's role as a pivotal figure in the history of American democracy, he is not a historical personage with the personal bravura of an Aaron Burr or a Huey Long. This, after all, was a man who counted every penny he spent and filled volumes of journals with notes on the weather.   His hagiographers have depicted him as a man of perfect marble, swearing, in one historian's words, \"eternal hostility to every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" His detractors have portrayed him as a hypocrite: an abolitionist who owned slaves, an egalitarian who believed in racism, a libertarian who often failed to defend civil liberties.   Max Byrd, a scholar specializing in 18th-century literature and the author of five suspense novels, has focused on another contradiction in Jefferson's life -- his inability to reconcile the promptings of his head and his heart -- and has used this contradiction as a springboard for a wonderfully vivid novel that brings the sage of Monticello (or a version of him, anyway) to life.   Mr. Byrd is not interested here in using Jefferson as a vehicle for reinterpreting a pivotal era in America history; he is interested in Jefferson as a personality, as a highly gifted and conflicted individual who happened to play a formative role in the founding of this country. His Jefferson is an elusive, mercurial fellow: a romantic who conceals his emotional vulnerabilities behind a mask of cordiality; a lonely widower, who is ill at ease in the public world of banquets and speeches; a doting father who refuses to accord his daughters the freedom he promotes for the masses, and a chilly moralist and master of self-control who finds himself unexpectedly falling in love.   Borrowing a device from Gore Vidal's \"Burr,\" Mr. Byrd allows the reader to see his protagonist through the eyes of a young man who works in Jefferson's office. In this case, the young man is based on a real person named William Short, one of Jefferson's proteges, who served as his secretary during his years as American envoy to France. A callow, impulsive young man, Mr. Byrd's Short is almost hopelessly in awe of Jefferson; he hopes to play Boswell to Jefferson's Johnson.   \"He would sift, examine, develop,\" Mr. Byrd writes of Short. \"Penetrate Jefferson's defenses, disclose the springs of his character: explain once and for all why he guarded his feelings so closely; why his feelings were all the stronger for being walled in and guarded.\"   Although the fictional Short's memoirs cut back and forth in time to sketch in Jefferson's youth and the years of the American Revolution, they concentrate on Jefferson's tenure in France (1784-89), a period that recently drew considerable attention in a biography by Willard Sterne Randall, who argued that the sophistications of Paris effectively helped to transform Jefferson's world view. This is also the period when Jefferson is believed, by some writers, to have seduced a mulatto housemaid named Sally Hemmings.   Skating nimbly around the Hemmings controversy, Mr. Byrd's Short instead focuses his attention on Jefferson's romantic attachment to Maria Cosway, a painter married to a successful British artist. It appears to have been love at first sight. We see Jefferson behaving like a besotted schoolboy in front of the lovely Maria: he even breaks his wrist, attempting to impress her by leaping over a fence.   The affair quickly blossoms, and then just as rapidly dissolves. Why has their love failed to take root? Short speculates that \"Maria was far too flirtatious and independent\" and Jefferson \"liked women who were submissive, feminine, yielding.\" Also, Short thinks, Jefferson's daughter Patsy hated Maria, and \"Jefferson's ties to Patsy were the unshakable Virginia ones of blood.\"   Here and there in this volume, Short engages in Freudian speculation about Jefferson's life. He suggests that Jefferson disliked his mother, and that this early, sour relationship colored his subsequent romances with women. He suggests that the early death of Jefferson's father left him in need of a father figure, and that George Washington filled the bill. And he suggests that the many losses Jefferson suffered in his life (the deaths of his parents, coupled with the untimely deaths of his wife and several of their children) caused him to erect elaborate emotional fences.   By placing this speculation in the mouth of the fictionalized Mr. Short, Mr. Byrd is able to sidestep questions concerning the veracity of such musings. In an author's note, he tells the reader that he has made a few minor changes in the historical record (mainly involving dates), but has otherwise adhered \"to the generally agreed-upon facts\" as he found them in the real William Short's papers, and contemporaries' papers, including the vast annotated edition of Jefferson's own writings.   So authoritatively does Mr. Byrd conjure up the day-to-day details of Jefferson's life, so knowingly does he describe the atmosphere of prerevolutionary France that the reader practically forgets that his novel is based on thousands and thousands of researched facts. Indeed, \"Jefferson\" has the organic intimacy of a novel that has sprung full-blown from the imagination of its creator.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931123","headline":"Starks!

What the museum offered, in the form of lectures on Segovia's life, working methods, achievements and instruments, ending with a recital by Manuel Barrueco, was the kind of examination regularly lavished on composers and hardly ever on performers.    Performers, after all, stand a rung or two lower than composers on the evolutionary ladder. Composers create; performers are their henchmen. And besides, performers reap their rewards -- adulation, high fees -- in this world. Composers are rewarded posthumously, with such benefits as daylong seminars. But there are reasons Segovia's work warrants examination. Although the Spanish guitar had both virtuosos and enthusiasts long before he made his public debut in 1909, it was Segovia's evangelical zeal that brought the instrument into the mainstream of concert life. And although his own compositions were few and inconsequential, he goaded hundreds of composers into writing for his instrument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931123","headline":"A Seeker of Mystery Takes Stock of Suburbs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/23/nyregion/our-towns-a-seeker-of-mystery-takes-stock-of-suburbs.html","abstract":"  IT was a dark and stormy night.
