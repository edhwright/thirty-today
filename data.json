Tomoko Liguori Gallery  93 Grand Street  SoHo  Through July 24    An ominous tone runs through much of the work in this group show, which focuses on the relationship between personal identity and the body.  In Bill Jacobson's out-of-focus black-and-white images, a man's head becomes featureless and generic; in Joe Ziolkowski's studio pictures, crisply lighted and sharply focused, nude males balance precariously on a tightrope or hang upside down.   The fleshly theme is continued in Cindy Sherman's dress-up picture of herself as pregnant (with a plastic belly) and wearing white eye shadow and wild hair; one of John Coplans's nude self-portraits, as a heroic if hairy figure, is included as well. The dissolution of the body is suggested by Ilyse Soutine's flatfooted color photograph of what looks like a homemade electric chair, and by Jeff Wall's coolly dispassionate aerial view of a cemetery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Croatia and Bosnia : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/opinion/IHT-croatia-and-bosnia-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The international community has a growing tendency to cover up its indecision over Bosnia-Herzegovina by putting the blame not just on the Serbs but on the Croatian side, too. .On the one hand, the international community presses the Croats to negotiat","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Indurain Is Fast; Rominger Is First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/sports/cycling-indurain-is-fast-rominger-is-first.html","abstract":"  Luck, or whatever it was that he did not have earlier in the Tour de France, has begun to turn Tony Rominger's way, and today the Swiss rider won his second successive Alpine stage.

They must honestly and openly examine all causes of priestly abuse and the historical pattern of institutional cover-up. An examination of causes would demand serious answers to questions concerning the spiritual and psychological training of Catholic priests.

Among his generation of thirty-something solo performance artists, Mr. Cale, a Briton transplanted to New York City, has the tenderest, most poetic sensibility. At once surreal, romantic and funny, his best solo monologues explore relationships and varieties of sexuality with a finely-tuned ear to the nuances of erotic dialogue and a penetrating psychological awareness. The Nuyorican Poets are literary rappers whose style falls somewhere between Gil Scott-Heron and L. L. Cool J. Showtime is tonight at 8:30 and admission is free.  Fusing Two Talents    K. T.

Wittily phrased renditions of such comic delicacies as \"Rhode Island Is Famous for You\" blend beautifully with ballads like \"Something to Remember You By.\" The Dietz-Schwartz tribute plays at 9:30 tonight and tomorrow night. In her other show, \"For the Record,\" at 11:30 P.M. both nights, she sings selections from her new album, \"Crazy World\" (DRG).

This drag performer, who appears in several amusing get-ups, welcomes assorted guests, including Julie Halston. The musical fare ranges from \"Town Without Pity\" done as a campy hoods-and-bad-girl production number, to Kurt Weill's and Langston Hughes's \"Lonely House,\" done straight.

Obviously determined to be more authentic and less gooey than the 1937 black-and-white film adaptation, which starred Shirley Temple, this \"Heidi\" seeks to explore the characters in depth. It does, but three hours might have done the trick just as well.    Even before the opening credits, we see Grandfather (Jason Robards) feuding with his only son, who then stalks off with his wife and infant daughter, Heidi. The old man watches in horror as a tree struck by lightning falls on the young family. Only the baby survives. Grandfather retreats to his cabin. People will later claim that he has not been \"right in the head\" since his son's death.

If it were by Michelangelo, there would no doubt be lines stretching all the way from the museum's lobby to the Lehman wing, where \"Christ and St. Thomas\" is on view. But Verrocchio's reputation was long ago wounded by, who else, a critic: Giorgio Vasari, writing in 1550, almost three-quarters of a century after the unveiling of \"Christ and St. Thomas,\" described Verrocchio's art as \"hard and crude, since it was the product of unremitting study rather than of any natural gift or facility.\" Vasari's opinion has echoed through time so that now Verrocchio may be better known as the teacher of his studio assistant, Leonardo da Vinci, than for his own prodigious achievements.

Its Art Moderne design, by Raymond Irrera and Ben Schlanger, incorporated such innovations as indirect lighting and a sloping floor.

At least one of these prized prospects, if not both, is expected to join the Yankees this summer.   While General Manager Gene Michael has been stymied in his attempts trade for pitching help, the two young right-handers -- one from Australia and the other from the Dominican Republic -- have been compiling stellar statistics as starters at Columbus. If Michael does not complete a trade -- and one Yankee official said yesterday that the chances for a deal to occur soon seem remote -- then Hutton or Jean might get the call.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930717","headline":"Key Again Rights Yankees, Who Wrong the Athletics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/17/sports/baseball-key-again-rights-yankees-who-wrong-the-athletics.html","abstract":"  Always, there has been Jimmy Key this season. Through losing streaks and bullpen disasters, through successful skeins and talk of a pennant, Key has been there for the Yankees. Unchanged. Unflappable. Unemotional. Almost unbeatable.   Key was there for the Yankees again last night in his usual unruffled form, and for a change, he did not have to be so precise on the mound. That's because several teammates vented their frustration against the Oakland Athletics and helped boost the Yankees to a 10-3 victory at Yankee Stadium. The offensive eruption allowed the Yankees to snap a four-game losing streak against the A's, and it partly obscured more marvelous pitching by Key.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930717","headline":"After Disabling Des Moines, River Threatens South Iowa","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/17/us/the-midwest-flooding-after-disabling-des-moines-river-threatens-south-iowa.html","abstract":"  A week after the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers disabled Iowa's capital city, the Des Moines River is now bedeviling towns downstream in southeastern Iowa, pouring out of the Red Rock Dam fast enough to fill six 25-yard-long high school swimming pools every second.
