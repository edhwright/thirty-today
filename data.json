Verdi's \"Traviata\" was restored to its traditional self at the New York City Opera on Thursday night, the company's gimmick-laden 1991 production unceremoniously retired in favor of a new production whose sole gimmick is that it is directed by the soprano Renata Scotto.    Ms. Scotto made her directorial debut in Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" at the Metropolitan Opera in 1986, singing the title role as well. In recent years she has become increasingly interested in opera direction, but she has created a \"Traviata\" that probably resembles many of the more average productions she has sung in. It has an almost old-fashioned operatic style. During Violetta's confrontation with Germont, for example, the courtesan turns several times and sings, with distraught, wide eyes, at the audience, awkwardly reminding everybody that this troubled woman is really a soprano onstage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950318","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/nyregion/no-headline-069695.html","abstract":"  \"The longer it lasts, you see, the harder it will be for anyone on either side to pick up a gun.

No answer that can satisfy both the fundamentalist and the secular-minded is forthcoming, but this three-hour explication of biblical scholarship offers many other rewards.    The opening hour tomorrow begins with the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls, portions of the writings of an isolated Jewish sect that existed some 2,000 years ago. Scholars of religion speculate on how the tumultuous history of the ancient Jews is reflected in their holiest book.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950318","headline":"Airline Safety Audit Advises 30 Changes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/us/airline-safety-audit-advises-30-changes.html","abstract":"  An outside study commissioned by USAir to reassure the flying public that the nation's sixth-largest airline is safe has concluded just that.

Since 1989, he has performed and recorded regularly with Samuel Sanders, who is also Itzhak Perlman's regular accompanist, and because Mr. Diaz evidently takes the enlightened view that much of the cello repertory is chamber music, their collaborations are billed as the Diaz-Sanders Duo.   Mr.Diaz and Mr. Sanders had a few minor obstacles to overcome on Tuesday evening. The salonlike quality of the Renee Weiler Hall at Greenwich House Music School creates an ideally intimate atmosphere, but the school's piano needs tuning and probably an oil and lube job as well: the loud squeaking of one of its pedals became an intrusive obbligato in an otherwise stunning account of Beethoven's Sonata in G minor (Op. 5, No. 2).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950318","headline":"Sports of The Times; Stanford Finally Wins One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/sports/sports-of-the-times-stanford-finally-wins-one.html","abstract":"  FIFTY-THREE years is a long time, even for people who take the long view.

But it also has jeopardized Blount's future in basketball and led the Dobbs Ferry coach, John Costello, to make the accusation that the Tuckahoe coach, Marshall Rieff, encouraged his players to go after Blount to take him out of the game.\n\nIn the aftermath of the injury and accusation, a maelstrom of criticism has been levied by coaches, players and fans of both teams. The controversy was further fueled by the fact that Blount, recruited by college basketball powerhouses Syracuse and Texas, had attained hero status since transferring to Dobbs Ferry from New Rochelle High School last fall and had heightened the hopes of the Eagles winning their first state championship. A notice of claim for $25 million -- for pain and suffering, present and future medical expenses and loss of future earnings -- was filed by lawyers for Blount against the Tuckahoe School District and Rieff. In the notice, Blount charged \"negligent coaching and playmaking, which caused unnecessary and improper contact.\" Under state law, notice must be given to a public entity within 90 days of an accident.

Two hundred forty-five images, primarily from the last 15 years, have been assembled in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC: The Photographs (National Geographic Society, $50). Although technology and personal vision have changed the style of the magazine's photography, the belief in photography as what the book's author, Leah Bendavid-Val, calls \"the ultimate eyewitness\" seems stronger than ever. Ms. Bendavid-Val, a senior editor at National Geographic Books, writes that the use of color portrays \"foreign scenes more accurately and graphically than black and white.\" Undermining this notion of truth in color is the book's striking cover, a portrait of a young Afghan refugee, her face framed by a loose rust-colored scarf, set against a soft green background that accentuates her hazel eyes. The book jacket claims her eyes \"speak volumes about war and fear\"; but to the viewer her fearful expression could just as easily have been caused by an intrusive telephoto lens.

No better artistic testimony to this connection exists than Botticelli's \"Primavera,\" in which the Florentine spring is depicted as a goddess sweeping into a typical Tuscan meadow full of wildflowers and ripe fruit. Every year Florence celebrates the arrival of spring with music -- notably the Maggio Musicale -- and with displays of spring flowers in its parks, villas and public gardens, the most famous of which is of course the Boboli Gardens. At this time of year, a visit to the Uffizi to see the Primavera is not complete without a stroll in the gardens where many of the flowers in that painting can be seen.\n\nThe flower on the Florentine coats-of-arms is not a lily, as is commonly thought, but an iris, like the one in the bottom right hand corner of the Primavera. Every May, on a tranquil hillside half hidden under the belvedere of Piazzale Michelangelo, Florence celebrates its heraldic red iris with an international competition sponsored by the Italian Iris Society. Not widely publicized, the show lasts only two weeks, but I never miss the opportunity to visit it in the six-acre Iris Garden, which has more than 2,500 varieties and is only open for this show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"NEW YORKERS & CO.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-983395.html","abstract":"  Nonprofit Helps Debt-Ridden Escape Tyranny of Red Ink     Budget & Credit Counseling Services, a nonprofit group, is conducting free seminars to teach women how to handle money and credit and to get out of debt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"The Library's Their Oyster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/style/evening-hours-the-library-s-their-oyster.html","abstract":"  Annual benefit by Young Friends of New York Public Library, March 9.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"Warsaw Bans a Clinic's In-Vitro Fertilization Treatments","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/world/warsaw-bans-a-clinic-s-in-vitro-fertilization-treatments.html","abstract":"  The Warsaw medical authorities have ordered a private fertility clinic to stop in-vitro fertilization treatments on grounds that the doctors there were violating Poland's anti-abortion law.

The price is right; the food, fresh.\n\nWe found dining here a pleasant experience but only after trial and error enlightened us to what to order and what to avoid. In general, fast-cooking items (scallops) brought the best results; foods that needed no immediate supervision (chicken), the worst, as if kitchen staff walked away from the stove and forgot to retrieve the items before they became overcooked.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"New & Noteworthy Paperbacks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/books/new-noteworthy-paperbacks-628595.html","abstract":"  THE HIDDEN LIFE OF DOGS By Elizabeth Marshall Thomas.

In 1993 our reviewer, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, described the book as \"informative, delightful, innovative and full of an intimate knowledge.\" Also reissued is the groundbreaking MAN MEETS DOG, by Konrad Lorenz, translated by Marjorie Kerr Wilson (Kodansha, $12), which looks at the origins of the bond between animal and master. \"Anyone with a minimum interest in either cats or dogs can spend a rewarding and entertaining evening with this book,\" Thomas Foster said in The New York Times in 1955.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"The Demise of the Easter Bunny in East New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-the-demise-of-the-easter-bunny-in-east-new-york.html","abstract":"  AT their family-owned stuffed toy factory in Brooklyn's tough East New York section, where the current inventory of Easter bunnies and teddy bears is smaller than the stock of treasured memories, the Parisi brothers look back fondly on the period they have dubbed the Year of the Snake.

Whipping from image to abstraction, from narrative to reflection, from neat epigram to sensuous trope, poetry can cross terrain and change direction with tremendous swiftness. Compared to ordinary language, it can be like ice-skating compared to walking. (Discursive prose, to extend the comparison a bit mischievously, often resembles wading straight ahead.)

But frankly I'm really tired of watching secretaries of state trudge off to Damascus to beg Mr. Assad to resume negotiations that are in his self-interest. It's time for a new approach. I propose that the next time Mr. Christopher sits down with Mr. Assad, he opens like this:    \"Hafez -- you don't mind if I call you Hafez? Hafez, you are yesterday's man. You're still living in the cold war. I know you've only traveled outside the Middle East a few times, so let me tell you a little bit about the new world.   \"Hafez, Syria today can barely make a light bulb. That's sad. That's also why your per capita income is only $1,200 a year. Have you ever been to Japan, Hafez? At the Lexus factory in Toyota City, the Japanese produce 300 Lexus sedans each day with 66 human beings and 310 robots. And you can barely make a light bulb. The world is passing you by.    \"Now, Hafez, the reason I'm telling you this is because during the cold war, it didn't matter whether Syria made computer chips or potato chips, a Lexus or a light bulb, because you could make a good living just by milking the superpowers for aid and blackmailing your neighbors.   \"Yes, I see you smiling, Hafez. You know it's true. You milked the Saudis for billions by letting them know that there could be, as the Mafia would say, 'an unfortunate accident' in the oil fields if they didn't pay. But those days are over. The price of oil is down and the Saudis can't pay their bills anymore. Now Hafez, during the cold war you milked us a little, too. You milked the Europeans even more and the Soviets a lot. They bought your third-rate products and gave you arms and aid in return for your friendship. It was a good living, Hafez -- and you played us off against each other brilliantly. Chapeau.    \"But, Hafez, the cold war is over. There is a new global architecture. There are no longer two superpowers to play against each other. There is only one and we're broke.    \"Instead of superpowers, Hafez, there are super markets. There's the Tokyo bond market and the Frankfurt bond market and the Singapore bond market and the Wall Street bond market. These bond markets are actually more powerful than many governments today. And let me tell you, Hafez, you don't play the Tokyo bond market off against the Frankfurt bond market. No, no, no. They play you off. That's right, they play Syria off against Mexico off against Brazil off against Thailand.    \"Whichever country has the most stable government, the most efficient economy, the most Westernized legal system, the most convertible currency and the most educated labor force, gets rewarded with investment capital from the super markets. Those countries that don't get their house in order are left as roadkill on the global investment highway. And, Hafez, you are destined to be roadkill.    \"Now, Hafez, every time I come to Syria the phones don't work in the press room. When we go to Jordan and Egypt, we have touch-tone phones, but here, in your Sheraton Hotel, they have these old rotary dials with these very nice Syrian women who spend all day dialing for our reporters, because it can take hours to get through. It's generous of you, but don't you think those women would be more productive making goods for export?    \"Tell you what, I'm going to leave you my cellular, satellite phone. It's the latest model from Motorola. You'll reach me in Washington in seconds. Because, Hafez, I don't intend to make any more trips out here. You bore me, and these nine-hour history lessons on the Crusades that you put me through each visit are not an efficient use of my time. Why don't you put them on a compact disk and just hand them out to every visiting secretary of state?    \"You see, Hafez, I've got too many other important places to be: Mexico, Russia, China. Who should rule the Golan Heights is a fascinating question, but it's utterly irrelevant to U.S. interests today. But, hey, we'd still love to hear from you. When you're ready to do business, just dial 001-202-647-4910. Ask for Chris. Otherwise, Hafez, stay out of my life.\"    (Wednesday: Assad's answer.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"Poland's Jews","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/travel/l-poland-s-jews-790395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: In the summer of 1993, I visited Budapest, Cracow and Prague for a month.

Each morning, at 6:30 A.M., Mr. Gralto, a swarthy dark-mustachioed man who favored off-the-rack jogging suits, left his home in East Rockaway, L.I. Driving east against the traffic, he arrived within half an hour at his small junkyard in Oceanside. Inside his trailer-office, he phoned home. \"Vera, I'm here,\" he reassured his common-law wife.    Mr. Gralto then fed the junkyard's guard dog, a 125-pound German shepherd named Bandit, before his employees arrived promptly at 8 A.M. and the orders came ringing in. A hard worker and a hard-driving boss, Mr. Gralto typically ordered in lunch, worked untgil early evening and drove straight home. At his modest six-room home, a converted one-story bungalow on the waterfront, he and Vera Marino usually shared quiet dinners, though occasionally they dropped in on her daughter and son-in-law's. In the summer, the couple sometimes went boating, or had the kids over for a cookout.    \"He put in long days,\" said Detective Paul Vitucci of the Nassau County Police. \"He demanded punctuality from his workers. He demanded very high productivity. One time, he had a guy out there who had nothing to do. Gralto had him work in the yard, sweep up the yard, rake it clean.\"    But the admiration ended there. The orders coming in, according to an indictment in State Supreme Court in Queens, were from traffickers in stolen auto parts. Someone would ask for the nose of a 1992 Nissan Maxima. The fender of a 1991 Plymouth Acclaim. A couple of phone calls later, the indictment charges, Mr. Gralto had arranged for one of his trusty \"steal men\" to cruise parking lots and residential streets, mostly in Queens, occasionally in Nassau County. He would then \"chop up\" the cars, fulfill the order with the buyer and stockpile the remaining parts, the indictment says.   To business associates, Mr. Gralto's favorite comment was: \"I'm an honest businessman trying to make an honest day's dollar.\" But law-enforcement officials say this case, broken last month and based on hundreds of hours of wiretaps of his conversations as well as video surveillance, offers an unusually vivid glimpse into the workings of an auto theft ring, a core group of 13 that extended from a reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family to Mr. Gralto, down to the \"cutters\" and the \"steal men.\" The case sheds light on why more than half the cars stolen in New York vanish in Byzantine networks of thieves, chop-shop owners, thieves who specialize in certain parts, illegal parts suppliers and unscrupulous mechanics -- all of whom create an artificial demand for the supply of auto parts.   Organized crime syndicates have been involved in auto theft since at least the 1960's. But since the 1980's, car theft has grown increasingly organized, as a new breed of expensive and sophisticated cars, equipped with a growing array of gadgets and parts, multiplied the potential profits from theft. And because a police department overwhelmed with more serious crimes virtually ignored auto theft until the early '90s, the risk of punishment was low.   Beleaguered by perhaps the most skillful auto thieves in the nation, the city's car owners -- already suffering from a scarcity of garages and monthly indoor parking fees of up to $700 -- can take some comfort in statistics, if nothing else. Partly because of rising police attention, the number of reported thefts has fallen steadily since a record 146,309 in 1990. Still, 94,525 were reported stolen last year, or almost 260 cars a day. Of the 30 biggest American cities, only drivers in Detroit and San Francisco were more likely to have their cars stolen in 1993, says the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance trade organization.   But because of New York's sophisticated rings, its 1.8 million car owners paid the highest theft premiums: $248, or five times the average for the 30 cities. \"Though the theft claims are not as frequent as in Detroit or San Francisco, the average loss is higher because the chances of recovery are far lower,\" said Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Institute.   So pervasive is the problem in some neighborhoods that drivers have adopted an almost fatalistic attitude -- particularly in Queens, home to 38 percent of all cars registered in the city in 1993. Near the Fresh Meadows shopping mall, one of the hardest-hit areas in the hardest-hit precinct of the city and a favorite target of the ring, so many cars were stolen last year that officers were posted on high-rise rooftops to watch the streets and residents could rattle off the names of victimized neighbors.   Under pressure to combat auto theft, law enforcement officials involved in the yearlong investigation by detectives assigned to the Queens District Attorney and by the Nassau County police were eager to talk about the case, which they describe as a benchmark in their efforts.   \"This is the first auto-theft prosecution under the state's Organized Crime Control Act,\" said Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. \"These weren't isolated thefts. You're talking about a highly sophisticated enterprise that stole and dismantled cars and set up a business in stolen parts.\"   At the arraignment last month, all the defendants pleaded not guilty. Joseph Mure, a lawyer representing Mr. Gralto and Ms. Marino -- as well as her son-in-law Frank Merendino, who is also charged with assisting Mr. Gralto -- said recently that they maintain their innocence and denied any connection to organized crime. Lawyers who represent the other suspects and who chose to comment said their clients also declare their innocence.   Vincent Asaro, 60 -- who is charged with being a captain in the Bonanno crime family and with being at the top of this theft ring -- further denies that he controlled Mr. Gralto. \"He denies any involvement with organized crime, period,\" said his lawyer, Stephen G. Murphy, who has been involved in many high-profile cases in New York. THIEF, CUTTER, BROKER: THE CAR-THEFT LADDER     Guy Gralto, 34, grew up in Ozone Park. Investigators believe he has been involved in the auto-theft business for at least the last 11 years, climbing his way up, from thief to cutter to broker, in the tightly knit car-theft industry in southeastern Queens. He had been arrested only once, for possession of two stolen vehicles with illegal vehicle identification numbers, in 1988, and that case was later dismissed. Detectives who shadowed him for a year described him as an excitable man, who spoke in a loud voice even during normal conversations, barking into his telephone. At work, he kept his phone conversations short and businesslike, though last Sept. 5, unsure of the holiday, he spent minutes trying to persuade every caller that it was actually Memorial Day.   Not all his business associates were privy to Mr. Gralto's softer side, his love of pets. Besides Bandit, the German shepherd he had taken in as a sickly stray in Howard Beach, he poured affection on a small dog and three parrots at his East Rockaway home. Last summer, when a friendly chop shop was raided by the police and its guard dog was shot, Mr. Gralto's first telephone call, say detectives listening to wiretaps, was to inquire about the pit bull. \"Oh no, jeez, they shot the dog. Poor dog.\"   According to the indictment, Mr. Gralto's Oceanside business traced its roots to another auto-theft ring that he and a former partner set up in an inconspicuous warehouse in Maspeth, Queens, in November 1993. In Queens' auto-theft industry, a tight network where everyone knows everyone else, it was perhaps natural for Mr. Gralto to join forces with Martin Bosshart, a Woodhaven resident with a criminal record, law enforcement officials said. It was also natural that in an industry with its own peculiar hierarchies and codes of advancement that Mr. Bosshart, who was only 25, became the junior partner, with Mr. Gralto taking the lion's share of the profits. But Mr. Bosshart's inexperience was more than compensated for by his extremely violent behavior, officials said, pointing out he had been arrested on charges of attempted murder in 1990, though never convicted. In 1988, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted grand larceny in another case.   The joint operation earned millions of dollars by stealing and chopping up roughly 20 cars a week, Detective Vitucci and other officials said. But they said there was a conflict larger than both men: Mr. Bosshart paid tribute to the Gambino organized crime family. But Mr. Gralto, who had been loosely allied with Mr. Asaro for a number of years, was holding back payments from the reputed Bonanno captain.   The indicted individuals -- all \"stand-up guys who don't rat on each other,\" according to Detective Vitucci -- have provided few details of the ensuing fallout. But investigators believe that on Feb. 25, 1994, with the Bonanno captain's consent, Mr. Bosshart and two accomplices forced Mr. Gralto out of the Maspeth business. Inside the warehouse, the indictment says, Mr. Bosshart and two associates severely beat Mr. Gralto, stole thousands of dollars and then dragged him into an office and shot him in the leg.   After the shooting, Mr. Gralto -- to continue his career in the auto-theft business -- had no choice but to turn to Mr. Asaro for protection, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Gralto moved to Long Island, abandoning a salvage yard, Conduit Auto Parts, he owned in Howard Beach. In an industrial corner of Oceanside, he rented space in a carpet warehouse where he showed up to work, six days a week, dressed invariably in jogging suits.    Mr. Asaro shielded Mr. Gralto against other auto-theft rings looking to expand, steered business his way and sometimes provided him with his own car thieves, said Detective Cary Brenner, of the Queens District Attorney's Office Squad. A flat weekly fee, typically around $500, was delivered to the Great In Pasta, a restaurant in Hewlett, L.I., where Mr. Asaro spent his evenings.  A SMALL CIRCLE OF TRUST     In Oceanside, or sometimes at his home, Mr. Gralto received orders and dispatched his thieves, the indictment says. Whenever he did not perform those tasks himself, Mr. Gralto trusted only Ms. Marino, 49, her son-in-law Mr. Merendino, 32, or Louis Scarantino, 31, a childhood friend accused of financing a warehouse for stolen parts in East Rockaway. They were all indicted.   Two others indicted were acquaintances from Mr. Gralto's years in the auto-theft business -- Anthony LaGreca and Keith Hillman, who worked at auto-supply shops in Jamaica, Queens, and Bay Shore, L.I., respectively -- regularly called him with orders, said Detective Brenner, who eavesdropped on hundreds of conversations.   \"Nose off a '91 Max, white, two-door,\" was a typical order for a Nissan Maxima.   \"O.K. I'll buy it,\" Mr. Gralto said, after haggling over a price.   Mr. Gralto then paged one of his steal men, who were paid between $400 and $600 to find the car and drop it off at a pre-arranged location, Detective Vitucci said. One of Mr. Gralto's employees would pick up the car and drive it to a friendly chop shop where it would be dismantled, generally for $1,800, the detective said.   \"I bought it,\" Mr. Gralto would say, calling back the orderer of the part. \"I'll have it to you in a day or two.\" The parts were delivered to Mr. LaGreca, 30, who had previously been convicted of insurance violations, burglary, attempted possession of stolen property and attempted forgery. Other valuables were warehoused, and, after everyone was paid, Mr. Gralto could clear several thousand dollars.   The indictment says that two of Mr. Gralto's regular thieves were Victor Norwood, 35, and Thomas Parker, 42, two tall, thin men from Jamaica who over the years had acquired reputations as dependable steal men, Detective Brenner said. Although the operators of an auto-theft ring are often shielded from scrutiny, the steal men are the organization's foot soldiers, often desperate people who are willing to expose themselves to great risks for a few hundred dollars and, unlike their bosses, are unable to afford top-notch lawyers.    Mr. Parker's criminal record, dating to 1970, includes multiple convictions for grand larceny, possessing an illegal vehicle identification number and making a false report of a stolen vehicle; Mr. Norwood, with convictions for harassment and the unauthorized use of a vehicle, also spent five years in prison for first-degree manslaughter. THE M.O.: DAYLIGHT, PARKING LOTS, TRAIN STATIONS     Dressed in dungarees, driving junk-cars with stolen out-of-state license plates, the steal men favored spots in northeast Queens -- parking lots at the Fresh Meadows shopping mall, St. John's University and at Long Island Rail Road stations, say the detectives. They stole not at night, but during working hours.   From their surveillance investigators inferred that the two suspects worked like other professional car thieves. They usually broke in by smashing a small window. If an alarm blared, they popped open the hood, went around to the front and smashed the alarm, housed usually next to the engine. If a Club was used, they simply cut through the steering wheel. Finally, they started the car by breaking the steering column.   \"It took them usually less than 20 seconds to start a car,\" Detective Brenner said. \"What made them good? Experience. Most car thieves are young, and not as reliable.\"   Admired for his efficiency, Mr. Gralto, investigators pointed out, possessed another quality that led to his downfall: foolhardiness.   A simple, unostentatious man, Mr. Gralto eschewed the grand ambitions that drive many of his peers, Detective Vitucci said. Unlike a John Gotti who used car theft as a stepping stone into one of New York's five traditional crime families, Mr. Gralto apparently had no aspirations of joining the Bonanno family, of ever becoming a \"made man.\"   Instead, Mr. Gralto revealed a more pedestrian goal in phone calls: \"I want to make a million a year.\" That goal, investigators said, pushed him to grow reckless.   When an industry associate alerted him that his Oceanside yard was under surveillance, Mr. Gralto ignored the tip. When detectives, waiting in ambush a stone's throw from Mr. Gralto's home, phoned him on Feb. 15 at 6 A.M., to warn him that they were coming to arrest him, Mr. Gralto simply said, \"Knock it off,\" and hung up. When the police called back immediately, he still believed it was a joke. Spitting out an expletive, he slammed down the receiver. It was only when the police began breaking down his front door that the truth hit him, Detective Vitucci said.    Mr. Gralto tried to save the door by opening it. But it was too late.   By the time all 13 suspects were arrested last month, the ring had operated 10 months, from May 1994 to February 1995, the indictment charges. During a period of intense surveillance, from May 9 to Aug. 11, 1994, the ring chopped up and sold parts from 21 cars -- worth $244,000 on the used car market but almost $1 million in parts, the District Attorney's office charged.    In a related indictment, Mr. Bosshart, the alleged Gambino loyalist, and his two associates from Maspeth were also charged last month with possessing and dismantling stolen vehicles, and with assaulting Mr. Gralto. Murray Richman, Mr. Bosshart's lawyer, said his client denies all the charges against him. THE TOP CARS AT HOME AND ON THIRD WORLD ROADS     Because of the immense profits from cannibalizing cars, the police estimate that more than half of all cars stolen in the city are taken for their parts, said Lieut. Robert Martin of the Auto Crime Squad.   Not surprisingly, the cars most frequently stolen are made by General Motors -- because of the greater demand for used G.M. parts.   By contrast, Lieutenant Martin attributed the theft of three cars in the top 10 list of most stolen cars -- 1994 Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans -- to the growing number of stolen cars exported to Third World nations, where there are few or no dealerships that sell new cars and where vehicle registration is often nonexistent.    The Japanese makers' reputation for durability make them popular in underdeveloped nations with unreliable roads, Lieutenant Martin said. This market is controlled by recently established rings, based among the new immigrant groups, specialize in illegal exports. They steal new cars and resell them, for double or triple their original worth.   In the end, organized crime rings account for almost nine out of 10 car thefts in the City, Lieutenant Martin said.   Faced with the disquieting statistic that more than nine cars a day were reported stolen in the 107th Precinct last year, Linda Leuzzi thinks her Jeep Cherokee could be next. She and her husband, Vincent, live in Jamaica Estates, on a block where brazen thieves have been known to career down the street, searching for cars in broad daylight -- even on Mother's Day.    Three times in the last three years, inside their second-floor bedroom, which faces the driveway, the couple were awakened in the predawn hours by breaking glass. Each time, they chased away the thieves in time.   \"Now, if we hear a noise outside, we jump out of bed and go to the window,\" she said. \"We have the window open, even in the middle of winter. We want fresh air, but it's also because we want to know what's happening out there.\" The Indicted: A Flow Chart\"    Though it is on the decline, auto theft remains a scourge in many neighborhoods. As cars have become more sophisticated, so has car theft. Law enforcement officials in Queens and Nassau County say a recent indictment is a key step in efforts to combat the crime and illustrates the power of market forces for blackmarket auto parts. Their case: Vincent Asaro, a reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family, was at the top, receiving $500 per week in tribute from the man they say operated the ring, Guy Gralto. They say Mr. Gralto connected with buyers and helped hire car cutters and thieves. All those charged have pleaded not guilty. You and the 'Steal Men': Get Protection and Say a Prayer     IN a densely populated city where few residents own private garages, and where monthly indoor parking fees can cost as much as a studio's rent, New Yorkers must leave their cars to the gods of the streets. Experts say that in New York -- especially in New York -- nothing will stop a thief. But there are devices that will make stealing your car more difficult, and maybe persuade the thief to move on to your neighbor's car. Here's a look at the most popular. IGNITION CUT-OFF SYSTEM    HOW IT WORKS: If the proper encoded ignition key is not used, or if an attempt is made to start the car without a key, electronic sensors built into the ignition lock automatically cut off the electric power. Usually, the system also activates an alarm. Some sought-after cars, like the Corvette and Lexus LS400, come already equipped with the system. But it can be installed in any car for a few hundred dollars.    THE BOTTOM LINE: The best, experts say. \"We've seen this to be effective even in very high-profile vehicles, like the Camaro or Corvette,\" says Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute. \"Compared to previous models that did not have this system, the thefts have come down, and have stayed down. Now the theft of Corvettes is only twice above average, whereas in the past it used to be 10 times the average.\"    HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: Tow the car away. ALARM    HOW IT WORKS: Sirens, flashing lights, or robotic voice warns thieves to \"stand back.\"    THE BOTTOM LINE: \"They don't do much good,\" Mr. Hazelbaker says. \"It's a harsh statement. But we simply don't find the difference in the theft records of cars that have these alarms and those that don't.\" Especially in New York, people tune them out.    HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: One thief breaks into the car and immediately releases the lever of the hood. An accomplice pops open the hood and smashes the alarm, which is usually installed near the engine. Frank Vasquez, an officer with the city police's crime prevention division, recommends adding a lock to the hood latch. LOJACK    HOW IT WORKS: A radio transceiver is hidden somewhere in the car. When the car is stolen, the police enter the vehicle identification code into a computer system, and a broadcast system emits radio signals to turn on the transceiver in the car. Each precinct has at least one patrol car equipped with a tracking computer, says Officer Jim Muller of the crime prevention division.    THE BOTTOM LINE: The recovery rate in several states for stolen cars with Lojack is 95 percent, according to the manufacturers. But the unit, which costs $595 or less, is unproven in New York City, where here it has just been introduced and where there are special problems.    HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: The owner must report the theft to the police immediately. If the owner dallies, especially in New York, the car could be in a chop-shop by the time the owner makes the call. STEERING-WHEEL IMMOBILIZERS    HOW IT WORKS: The most famous is the Club, a device that is locked to the steering wheel and limits turning.    THE BOTTOM LINE: Many auto-security experts regard these devices, used by themselves, as minor deterrents. HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT By spraying Freon, a refrigerant, on the immobilizer's lock, thieves can easily smash it. Most don't even bother doing that. They simply cut through the steering wheel, which (to prevent injuries during accidents) is usually made of an aluminum wire covered with foam and vinyl. COMBAT AUTO THEFT    HOW IT WORKS: Under a police program, car owners stick a notice on their windshields, allowing the police to stop their cars between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M.    THE BOTTOM LINE: It deters car thieves who don't want to needlessly increase their chances of being stopped. For no cost, drivers who register cars at the local precinct can get between 5 and 15 percent discounts on insurance premiums, Officer Vasquez said.    HOW THE THIEVES GET AROUND IT: Once the car is stolen, the chances of recovery are no different from cars not registered in this program. Since the program's inception in the mid-1980s, 126,000 cars were registered, said Barbara Keimes, an officer in Crime Prevention. Of that total, 1,000 cars were stolen. But only 45 cars were recovered, and 20 thieves were arrested.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"Far Above and Beyond the Call of Coaching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/sports/basketball-far-above-and-beyond-the-call-of-coaching.html","abstract":"  Basketball brought them together in 1987, when Michele Sharp, the coach, saw Debbie Lytle, the player, walk through the gymnasium door holding a duffel bag and Brian, Lytle's 3-month-old son.

The bay is one of the continent's prime breeding and feeding grounds for endangered humpback whales.   Cruise lines, though, are celebrating the idea, saying it represents an opportunity for Alaska to increase its revenues from tourism without harming either the whales or the environment.   As a lure for visitors, few scenes in all of North America rival Glacier Bay, the centerpiece of the 3.2 million-acre Glacier Bay National Park, which was established in 1980. Snowcapped mountains, some 15,000 feet tall, rise straight out of its crystal blue waters. About 65 miles inland from the mouth of the bay are the massive faces of two glaciers that in summer periodically produce icebergs as big as office buildings. Sea lions, seals, eagles, bears and moose share the space with killer, minke and humpback whales. Glacier Bay attracted 250,000 visitors last year, double the number of a decade ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"The War in Bosnia as Told to Students by a U.N.

With the Soviet Union gone and the cold war over, the only threat that the Cuban Communist poses to the United States lies in the imagination of ideological warriors like Senator Jesse Helms. While the time has not yet come to welcome Mr. Castro to Washington, a re-examination of Cuba policy is long overdue. The embargo of Cuba, begun when John Kennedy occupied the White House and Nikita Khrushchev was Soviet leader, has outlived its usefulness.    Conservatives still cling to the notion that isolating Cuba and creating misery for its people will eventually cause an uprising and sweep Mr. Castro from power. Now that he is without Soviet support and his economy is in tatters, they reason, sanctions should be tightened.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"Files Show Bank Aided Nazi Cause","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/world/files-show-bank-aided-nazi-cause.html","abstract":"  Documents kept secret for 50 years have shown that Germany's largest bank actively aided the Nazi regime beginning in 1933 in expropriating Jewish businesses, and helped Hitler secure economic control over the neighboring lands he had conquered.

That's when it's going well. When her lover is absent, as he is for most of the songs, \"this love becomes my torture/ this love my only crime.\" P. J. Harvey's third album, \"To Bring You My Love\" (Island; CD and cassette), has nothing to say about pop romance and everything to do with Romantic obsession. It presents love as a purifying ordeal and a spiritual quest, as both a state of grace and a fall from grace, in songs delivered with the austere deliberation of the blues.   Love, faith, power and terror have always been tangled in Harvey's songs, and \"To Bring You My Love\" just knots them tighter. Her lyrics have left behind the modern world for the terrain of the elements -- deserts and rivers, wind and rain -- and the sphere of allegory and revelation. She doesn't separate sacred and earthly love; both are cataclysmic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950319","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living In/Wyckoff; Country Ambiance in Ramapo Foothills","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-of-living-in-wyckoff-country-ambiance-in-ramapo-foothills.html","abstract":"  WITH trees that arch over many of its streets, long rolling lawns and a central business district made up mainly of converted old houses, Wyckoff has the ambiance of a country hamlet, even though it is only a 45-minute drive from Manhattan.

The first is choosing the agent. For joining wood, aliphatic resin, usually called carpenter's glue, or hide glue are good choices.

Contact cement is ideal for bonding laminates to wood or wood products. Polyvinyl resin, common white glue, can repair books, paper or leather.\n\nSome agents like polyvinyl resin do not sand well. If the work will be exposed to the elements, a waterproof resorcinal adhesive is a good choice. Most agents work best at room temperatures.

Can it deliver employment to the three million blacks and 600,000 whites that the Government conservatively estimates to be without jobs?

In \"The Devil Never Sleeps,\" Lourdes Portillo, a Chicana film maker, takes the role of cinematic gumshoe as she investigates the mysterious death of her beloved multimillionaire Uncle Oscar.

Using vintage snapshots, old home movies and interviews, the film builds a biographical portrait of Oscar Ruiz Almeida, a Mexican rancher who amassed a fortune exporting vegetables to the United States and went on to become a powerful politician and businessman. A go-getter and a charmer, Uncle Oscar married twice. With his first wife, who died of cancer, he adopted two children. After she died, he married a much younger woman who produced two more children from artificial insemination.

But the administration, doing some long-range planning, decided that being the safety school was not good enough.

And according to academics around the country who have looked on with envy, the strategy worked. A1.
