The fusion resulted in a show that explored the downside of psychedelia. Xanax 25, a New York band that plays every Monday night at the Nightingale bar (213 Second Avenue, at 12th Street, East Village), made angry music inspired more by Altamont than by Woodstock, more by Charles Manson than by Timothy Leary.

One might have asked such a question in 1987, when for the first time there were more people going in and out of London's airports -- a staggering 57 million -- than actually lived in the whole of Britain. But then, just as travel was clearly becoming a commonplace and the world was running out of new areas to explore, suddenly, unpredictably, the Soviet Union broke up, its ebb tide leaving vast tracts exposed. From Estonia to Mongolia, it was potentially a traveler's bonanza. Ancient cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Tashkent, free of the bureaucratic quagmire of Homo sovieticus, winked invitingly at adventurous beachcombers.   Appealingly, this would not turn out to be a one-way traffic. For once, the travel writer, sometimes criticized for being a selfish loner evading domestic responsibilities and plundering poorer countries for the glory of his own ego, could be making a real contribution to the country he was in. These new republics needed stories; their people, in the urgent task of finding new identities, needed reacquainting with both old and recent myths. Because of the often dire economics of these places, and their citizens' lack of experience and research tools, it would be foreigners who would start the process -- as well as communicate what they found to the wider world, in the true tradition of Marco Polo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"IN THE NATURAL STATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/in-the-natural-state.html","abstract":"IT took all the cunning of a 4-year-old to get to my father's desk undetected.

Yet while Chinese regard Mount Tai as one of the most famous places in their land, redolent with a history that goes back to visits by Confucius 2,500 years ago, it rarely appears on tourist itineraries.   It has been about 15 years since China opened up its doors to Western tourists, yet foreigners still crowd into just a few big cities, seeing standard sights, without ever meeting a peasant, even though three-quarters of the nation's 1.2 billion people live in the countryside. The tourism industry, in other words, has fostered a cocoon that allows Westerners to pass through China without ever quite stepping into it. Since returning to the United States after five years in Beijing, I have found that the most common query I get is not about Deng Xiaoping's health but rather about how to escape this cocoon.    What I tell people, to start with, is that it has never been easier to visit the \"real China\" beyond the tourist circuit. Independent travel can be frustrating, but with many hotels offering airport pickup and concierges arranging train and air tickets, few foreigners get irretrievably lost. Certainly it is hard to imagine a safer part of the world in which to roam about. While it is possible to take a regular tour of the main cities in China and then tack on a week of individual travel at the end, my recommendation is to go without a tour group if you are comfortable doing so.   The place to begin a self-guided two-week tour is in a Chinese-style courtyard hotel like the Lu Song Yuan or the Hao Yuan, in Beijing. Both hotels are built in the traditional courtyards that were once home to the aristocracy, and the 17-room Hao Yuan was the residence of the former Chairman, Hua Guofeng, until he was ousted by Mr. Deng at the end of the 1970's. Neither is convenient by Western standards -- the staff usually does not speak English and a request for a bucket of ice may take an hour to convey before it is understood and ignored. But the rooms are comfortable and the courtyards are full of the charms of China. On the other hand, if you place a premium on comfort and convenience, stay at the totally modern Palace Hotel, with its pair of gold Rolls-Royces to ferry you around the city. An alternative, also in the center of Beijing, surrounded by little shops and narrow alleys, is the Sara Hotel.   Any guidebook will tell you what to see in Beijing; my favorites are the Forbidden City, the Tibetan-style Yong He Gong temple and Tiananmen Square (including the Mao Zedong mausoleum; despite the rumors about wax, it really is Mao's corpse on display). You might also notice the high red walls of Zhongnanhai, an old imperial compound on the Avenue of Eternal Peace less than a mile west of Tiananmen. It is the new Forbidden City, the workplace and playground for today's Communist leaders. Visitors are not allowed beyond the soldiers at the gate.    Several Beijing hotels and shops rent bicycles for a dollar or so a day; they are one-speed contraptions but are usually functional, and in any case it is far safer to bike in Beijing than it would be in Western cities. Instead of sticking to the main streets, meander through the hutong, or back alleys, where residents live in one-story housing and share toilets with their neighbors. Rooms are so cramped that people often sit in their doorways, munching on watermelon or chatting with neighbors.   Almost everybody makes a side trip from Beijing to the Great Wall, but instead of going by bus, take a taxi and an interpreter. Your hotel can arrange an interpreter for $2.50 an hour or so, or you may simply run across an English-language student who is willing to accompany you for the day and interpret free of charge.   On the way back from the Great Wall, have the taxi driver take a dirt road randomly off the main route until you find yourself in the middle of a little village. You will find the peasants happy to talk to you, through the interpreter, and they'll be thrilled if you have brought a Polaroid camera and can take their photos.   AFTER a few days in Beijing, take the night sleeper train seven hours west to the much-overlooked city of Datong in Shanxi Province. Fifteen hundred years ago, Datong was the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty, whose legacy is a spectacular cliff of carved Buddhas 10 miles outside the city. The Yungang Grottoes include 53 caves decorated with 51,000 statues and carved reliefs, yet what is most awe-inspiring is the scale of the sculpture: stone Buddhas that soar up to 55 feet high. To me these huge, serene statues in the middle of nowhere are as exhilarating as Europe's Gothic cathedrals, for the offer a similar mix of artistry and spirituality.   While modern Datong itself is a rather grim coal-mining metropolis -- offering a much more realistic slice of urban Chinese life than either Beijing or Shanghai -- it is also less than an hour's drive from the Great Wall. Unlike the reconstructed parts of the wall near Beijing, the wall near Datong is the original -- a crumbling, worn mound of rocks overgrown with shrubbery 2that extends endlessly toward the horizon.   After five or six days in Beijing and Datong, head south to Taian in Shandong Province -- again by train, the means of locomotion for most Chinese traveling between cities. One of your short rail journeys in China should be by hard seat, the cheapest class, which is how ordinary Chinese travel, but the nine-hour journey from Beijing to Taian is not the one to spend jammed in an uncomfortable railroad car as people spit on the floor and converse raucously about the large size of foreigners' noses.   Taian is the town at the base of Mount Tai, or Taishan as the holy mountain is called in Chinese. It is possible to check your luggage by the train station and take a small bag or backpack for the overnight trip up the mountain. Stone steps have been carved up the hillside, so it is not so much mountain climbing as stair climbing. Most people can manage the trek up, with plenty of time for breaks and photographs, in five or six hours. A hotel on the summit, Shenqi Guest House, has private rooms with bath and a decent restaurant; it also offers sleeping bags and rents jackets against the chill. An alarm wakes guests at dawn to see the sun rise and proclaim, as Mao Zedong did, that \"The east is red.\"   Confucius climbed Mount Tai and came from a nearby town, Qufu, that is still dominated by the Kong family (Confucius is a European rendering; Confucius himself went by the name of Kong). Qufu is a typical country town, sleepy and gritty, yet it is chock full of temples and historic sites such as the family cemetery of 78 generations of Confucius's descendants. The town is an easy side trip from Mount Tai, or you can get back on the train for the daylong journey to Shanghai.   After several days of roughing it, you may enjoy the plush luxury of a place like the Garden Hotel, in the old French Concession of Shanghai. For the adventurous, the Chinese-run Red Flag Guest House, which used to accommodate only top party officials, now opens its bungalows to capitalists. A charming location and a sense of history and place are the rewards, but don't expect a concierge to arrange tickets or a maid to put mints on your pillow. Shanghai has some wonderful little privately owned restaurants and astonishing discos replete with Madonna-look-alikes, strobe lights and prostitutes who conduct their business with the help of cellular telephones.   The city also abounds with English speakers eager to ply their skills, and one or more of them will probably strike up conversations when you walk along the Bund, the historic riverfront district. Some are aiming to change money or act as paid tour guides, but others simply want to chat in English, and you may be able to find a terrific unofficial tour guide in this way. There are also con men on the waterfront, however: I once saw a pickpocket run down the Bund, chased by his victim and several onlookers; when a bus stopped on the main avenue, people inside jumped out to join the chase as well. The pickpocket was tackled, beaten up and then handed over to a policeman before the bus resumed its way.    After a couple of days in Shanghai take the two-hour, 20-minute flight to Guilin, a southern city in Guangxi Province that is the jumping-off point for daylong boat trips on the beautiful Li River. Three-day and four-day cruises on the Yangtze River in central China have become popular among foreigners as well, but the Li River is more scenic and eats up much less of a two-week vacation.   The Li River courses through spectacular rocky crags that are the inspiration for much of traditional Chinese watercolor landscapes. Children swim naked in the river as the boats pass, and peasants till the soil with water buffalo. The countryside is enchanting, so hire a taxi driver and an English interpreter for a half-day excursion to a nearby village, where you are likely to find mud-brick homes, a small elementary school with ramshackle desks, tiny backyard plots with pigs and chickens and flocks of little children who will make you feel like the pied piper. If you bring a few trinkets, someone may well invite you to a dinner of stir-fried vegetables and tofu with rice.    From Guilin, take a 60-minute flight to Guangzhou, the bustling southern metropolis also known as Canton. Ever since the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, Guangzhou has been at the front line of interaction between China and the West, and it was partly because of intrigues among Western traders here that the Opium War broke out and Hong Kong was ceded to Britain. The free markets of Guangzhou are among the most vibrant in the nation, and the Cantonese have a national reputation as sophisticates and gourmets. Yet while the Cantonese make great food, they don't know where to draw the line with ingredients.   One interesting but depressing sight is the Qingping Market, where turtles, salamanders, snakes, dogs and just about everything else are sold to be eaten. Afterward, intrepid tourists may wish to go to a snake restaurant or rat restaurant in Guangzhou. Snakes, in particular, are regarded as a virtual health food, a Chinese equivalent of alfalfa sprouts.    For those on a two-week itinerary, it is time to move on toward Hong Kong for the flight back. If you do not have too much luggage, take a bus or taxi for a few hours to Shenzhen, the boom town next to Hong Kong. Fifteen years ago Shenzhen was just a sleepy farming town; now it is a dynamic industrial city with a stock exchange, glass-and-steel skyscrapers, pin-striped lawyers and hundreds of factories churning out televisions, shoes and toys for consumers around the world.   From Shenzhen it is easy to walk across the border into Hong Kong, with only brief formalities with Chinese and Hong Kong immigration officials. On the Hong Kong side, trains take everyone to the urban areas. Alternatively, express trains run direct from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and minimize problems for those burdened by lots of luggage. The overland route is worthwhile simply because it conveys the feel of an endless construction zone; Guangdong Province has the fastest-growing economy in the world, and everywhere you look buildings are going up. Westerners joke that the official local bird is the crane.   For those with an extra week, Tibet makes a delightful side trip from Beijing. But be sure to get out of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and visit smaller towns such as Shigatse, site of a beautiful monastery and the traditional headquarters of the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan hierarchy. As everywhere in China, it is fascinating to visit the nomads and peasants who make up the bulk of Tibetans. Rural Tibet is still one of the most remote places in the world. I once met a Tibetan woman who was puzzled when I asked her whether her village had electricity. It turned out that she had never heard of electricity.   Most flights to Lhasa stop over in Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, the potbelly of China, and Chengdu makes a terrific break for a day or two. It is a somewhat grimy, very typical Chinese city of narrow lanes, tiny family-managed restaurants and, in the outskirts, peasants toiling over doll-sized plots of land. Moreover, Chengdu has, for my taste buds, the best food in China. I once took two Americans to dinner at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near the Jinjiang Hotel, and our table was soon laden with delicious spicydishes; there was more than the three of us could eat, yet the bill -- including beer -- was less than $5.    IN any case, wherever one goes in China, perhaps the most important thing is to spend time with the people.    In many cities, so-called English corners are set up one or more nights a week for local people to get together and practice English. Americans are hugely welcomed. Similarly, university campuses are a good place to meet English-speaking Chinese, and even on the streets you may meet someone who will invite you into a home for dinner.   In particular, spend at least a day in the countryside. My most interesting moments in China were spent in the villages, and the fascination was often mutual. On my first trip to China, in 1983, I was waiting for a train at a station in a rural part of Shandong Province, and so I sat down and began reading my guidebook. A few peasants gathered in front of me, watching me for entertainment, as if I were a movie. Then others approached, and soon dozens of them were sitting in a semi-circle around me, pointing and staring.    Soon nearly 100 peasants were sitting on the ground in front of me, the adventurous ones crawling in front of me to look at the cover of the book I was reading, and the episode ended only when the alarmed authorities led me to a small room and barred the audience from following. It was an encounter between two worlds, and I found it just as extraordinary as they did. IF YOU GO    In Beijing, an interpreter, official or unofficial, can negotiate to rent a regular taxi for the day for about $80 or a minivan (which are not allowed to pick up foreigners up at hotels) for $40. In other cities taxis should be a bit cheaper. Train travel is not expensive: a first-class train ticket from Shanghai to Guangzhou costs about $30.   Hotel prices are for a double room, calculated at the rate of 8.5 Chinese yuan (renminbi) to the dollar. The country code for China is 86.

By David George Gordon. (Sasquatch Books, paper, $5.95.) For gardeners everywhere, slugs are the enemy. Moving by night on trails of slime, they work their mischief wherever they go, leaving hostas and other choice plants in tatters as they chomp their way through the garden, using some 27,000 tiny teeth in a tonguelike organ called the radula. But gardeners in most parts of the country have an easy time with slugs, compared to their counterparts in the Pacific Northwest, where the native banana slug can grow up to 10 inches long and weigh as much as a quarter of a pound.   David George Gordon's \"Western Society of Malacologists Field Guide to the Slug\" (published, fittingly, in Seattle, where the banana slug holds sway) is brief, but gripping in its own way -- from the first paragraph (pointing out, inter alia, that the blood of slugs is green) to the last sentence (\"It is never a good idea to put a slug in your mouth!\"). Mr. Gordon provides a concise introduction to slug anatomy, describes more species of slugs than any gardener really cares to hear about and gives us an almost breathtaking account of the sex lives of these hermaphroditic gastropods.

A bronze symbol indicates the person's claim to fame: movies, television, radio, recording or theater. The tributes now total about 2,000 covering five acres. Four hundred are stars yet to be assigned; criteria is proof of ascendancy in one's field, plus some record of community service.

Of course, the list is not that neat, anyway; one biography is a foray in the continuing intellectual struggle over American history, and the memoir is a commentary on the same science taken up in the two scientific books.   The science is, broadly, evolutionary biology or, specifically, sociobiology, which, once it gets into your brain, can really spook you about genetics.

More ominously, the alphabet clumped the three books on sociobiology together in the list. There are other patterns here, but perhaps they will not bear thinking about.

The film makers pay for other expenses they incur, like moving parking meters or changing street lamps.    While film makers are encouraged to notify neighborhoods about their work, they do not have to, said Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the film office. Regarding donations, she said: \"That's an arrangement that would be made outside our office. There is no precedent in our office for this kind of thing.\"    On his own, Mr. Cosby gave $1,000 to the Convent Avenue Neighborhood Association after filming his television mystery show there last summer, and residents say the entertainer kept inconveniences to a minimum. By contrast, residents say the crew of a movie starring Mr. Snipes tried to block residents from their homes on Convent Avenue between 143d and 144th Streets.   Also last summer, when Madonna shot a music video at 270 Convent Avenue, residents say crew members tried to keep them from entering their lobby, and then mistakenly told owners of the co-op apartments that they had gained permission from their landlord to do so.   \"There were some hard feelings and also a confrontation,\" said Wil Buckery, treasurer of the Convent Avenue Neighborhood Association. \"A member of the board of directors of the building had to approach the Madonna people and sit down and talk eyeball to eyeball about what the true situation was.\"   Ms. Lee, an entertainment lawyer, said the community board wanted to begin telling producers that contributions are \"a tradition.\" And board members say they can describe Mr. Cosby's donations and how makers of the television series \"N.Y.P.D. Blue\" sent kindly worded letters to residents before they filmed and thank-you notes afterward.

Now we have a technology that works the way we listen rather than the way we hear: the musical CD-ROM. These disks, which slip into a personal computer's latest, most fashionable accessory, combine image and sound and text. They play music while showing pictures on the computer monitor; their \"pages\" of text contain \"buttons\" that call up other screen images and sounds; colored \"hot words\" can be clicked on, using a mouse, giving definitions and commentary; cursors can change shape from arrows to pointing fingers.

The vogue reached its peak at about the time of the First World War, lingered during the Depression, briefly revived in the 1930's and, after the war, went the way of privately owned railroad cars. Two things about YACHTS IN A HURRY: An Illustrated History of the Great Commuter Yachts (Norton, $40): The text by C. Philip Moore (himself the former owner of a commuter boat, the Saga) is buoyantly well written, miles removed from the technical cant one might expect in a 200-page book given over to describing one boat after another. Second, the introduction, written by Robert B. MacKay, the director of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, is sheer joy. His narrative of what the commuter boats were expected to do and did do could not have been improved upon by the writers of \"Saturday Night Live.\": \"Typically, owners were picked up at their docks or from their yacht clubs, often clad only in their nightgowns since they waited to don their business attire on board.

Indeed, one comes away from the show with the strong impression that this great architect of humanism didn't like humans very much and was somewhat disgusted to be one. Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72) wanted to cultivate himself to such utter perfection that he would become virtually a god.   And what a divine show he makes -- the first exhibition ever devoted to this model Renaissance Man! There has never been an Alberti exhibition before, Mr. Rykwert writes, because his achievement \"seemed (if anything) too plain and obvious, over familiar.\" Why rediscover a figure who was never lost to time? For half a millennium, Alberti has occupied a secure niche. The author of \"De Re Aedificatoria\" (1452), the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance, Alberti showed how classical forms could be adapted to the needs of his day. The Roman triumphal arch, for example, instead of being a freestanding structure, could be treated as a facade.

Imported records showed that the early American albums were truncated distortions of the British originals. And bootleg recordings of British radio shows brought even hotter news.   These pirated disks revealed that while Americans were hanging by their radios awaiting the hits, British listeners regularly heard the Beatles performing live on the BBC. Between 1962 and 1965, the band played 88 songs on British radio, most in multiple versions for a total of more than 280 performances. Included were 36 songs the group never recorded for its record label, EMI. It is no exaggeration to say that these radio recordings add significantly to our knowledge of what made the Beatles tick: even the familiar songs were played in arrangements that were harder-edged than the fussed-over studio versions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Ewing Hits For Only 3, But Knicks Rebound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/sports/pro-basketball-ewing-hits-for-only-3-but-knicks-rebound.html","abstract":"  After the Knicks' 25-point thrashing in Orlando on Friday night, Pat Riley characterized the humiliating defeat as an early-season wake-up call for his team.

The director of the dig, Eric Sjogvist, amused at my reaction, observed how much more exciting it would have been to have found \"the rich glory of the commonplace\" -- you know, the things that would tell us so much more about antiquity than the official pieces -- Helen of Troy's shoe closet or Alexander the Great's collection of drinking cups (he was a notorious boozer in his last year). Had we had in our hands a copy of the imaginative, beautiful book called MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS: Twenty Remarkable Collectors in Pursuit of Their Dreams (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), by Mitch Tuchman, with spectacular photographs by Peter Brenner, we would have dreamed up far better ideas. This amusing and serious book is about 20 real collectors who are most certainly not collecting \"dignified\" things like Renaissance bronzes or Manet paintings, but vast, gorgeous and thoughtful works like Lionel trains, puzzles, toy soldiers and swizzle sticks. The book is a revelation and a joy. Mr. Tuchman, a California collector himself and editor in chief at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Mr. Brenner, the museum's supervising photographer, present the collectors, their beliefs and their pieces compellingly. After reading the lucid and mesmerizing explanations of why these gifted collectors acquire puzzles or aquarium furniture and after looking at the dazzling photographs, you may become as hooked on the book as its subjects are by their satisfyingly strange artifacts.

Mr. Auchincloss, who like his literary ancestors Henry James and Edith Wharton, feels quite at home with the educated and the rich, has written in DEBORAH TURBEVILLE'S NEWPORT REMEMBERED: A Photographic Portrait of a Gilded Past (Abrams, $60) an admirably concise, witty and yet sensitive history of the Rhode Island summer resort, from the 18th century through its social apogee at the turn of the century to today. Ms. Turbeville's photographs are beautifully shot through fog and cheesecloth, creating partly an aura of an old family album, and partly an atmosphere of decomposition and decay. Artistic distributions of dust, debris, disorder and dead leaves make us expect the sudden appearance of a ghost. But no, the only inhabitants of these images are some pretty fashion models looking uncomfortable, as if they had gate-crashed Mrs. Astor's wake. The book suffers from selective recall. Whereas Mr. Auchincloss pays erudite tribute to the town's distinctive and beautiful architectural heritage from the 17th and 18th centuries, Ms. Turbeville, like most of the tourists, focuses exclusively on the gaudy mansions. She compares them to \"the palaces of the czars . . . of the doges, or Versailles.\" But these houses were not built by America's industrial czars; they only paid for them. They were built for, and ruled over, by their wives, the robber baronesses. Newport was always a matriarchy. Mr. Auchincloss mentions the Touro Synagogue, the oldest in America. It stands within a stone's throw of Trinity Church; its existence is symbolic of the spirit of tolerance that led to the founding of Rhode Island. That spirit is clearly embraced by Mr. Auchincloss, who quotes from George Washington's moving letter to the congregation, but it was certainly not adopted by the owners of the Newport mansions photographed by Ms. Turbeville, or by their descendants. Hence the cobwebs and the decay.

Faces pressed to windows, like those of children on a school outing, the travelers aboard the Eurostar Express want to be sure they don't miss the best part, the dizzying moment when they will all plunge into the black hole bored into the back of the Dover cliffs, the mouth of the Channel Tunnel, the 31-mile-long tube that will carry them on their first channel crossing beneath the sea.   Suddenly and without warning, the train pitches into darkness. Ears pop. Conversations rise. Is this it? \"Yes, yes, I'm sure this it, I'm quite sure this is it,\" declares one man, straining to peer into the dark when, just as suddenly, the train re-emerges into the morning sun. There is laughter. No, not yet. Just a small tunnel that carries the tracks beneath an overpass, part of the sprawling complex of sidings and switch yards that mark the final approach.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Past Lessons Help Pataki In Preparing For Power","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/past-lessons-help-pataki-in-preparing-for-power.html","abstract":"  As incumbency looms and George E.

This season's harvest suggests not only that the recession in photography book publishing is over, but also that the ballyhooed electronic revolution remains a gleam in the distance. The most promoted electronic title having to do with photography, a CD-ROM planned to accompany the book \"Passage to Vietnam\" (Against All Odds Productions/Melcher Media/Publishers Group West), is now optimistically promised for February, four months after the book's publication date. Museums may be busy digitizing their collections of photographs, but few of these electronic archives have the makings of a best seller.   The books that fit on traditional holiday coffee tables are sufficient consolation for anyone searching for new ways to look at photographs, however. Major collections of the lifetime work of Robert Frank and Andre Kertesz are complemented by visual anthologies of the human figure, self-portraiture and the dead and deformed (\"The Body,\" \"The Camera I\" and \"Harms Way\"). Fashion takes an impressive turn on the runway with \"Toni Frissell: Photographs 1933-1967\" (Doubleday), \"William Klein: In and Out of Fashion\" (Random House) and Albert Watson's \"Cyclops\" (Bulfinch/ Little, Brown). And edging in the direction of multimedia is \"Talking Pictures\" (Chronicle), a Chaucerian diversion in which 70 people, from Joan Rivers to Mister Rogers, elaborate on the image that has meant the most to them. Unfortunately, one has to go to the touring exhibition of the same title to hear the actual sound of their voices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Male Glee Club Giving Free Yonkers Concert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/music-male-glee-club-giving-free-yonkers-concert.html","abstract":"  THE longest-lived performing arts organization in Yonkers, the 69-year-old Yonkers Male Glee Club, sings Hanukkah tunes, holiday carols, popular songs and a medley from \"Showboat\" today at 3 P.M. at a free recital at Museum Junior High School.

A characteristically simple and lovely theme glides into being, touching on only a few elementary degrees of the scale. But it is all cast in octaves, doubled in the right hand and echoed in the left; this is melody with height and depth, a sound mass that hovers. (Liszt wrote octave doublings to increase the power of his thematic material; Schubert used them to broaden his music in space.) At the end of the phrase, the spell is broken: a trill rumbles low in the bass, casting an inexplicable gray shadow.   Schubert was a composer of beautiful melodies, as the legend goes. He was also something entirely different: a revolutionary who worked with blocks and layers of sound, harmonies adrift in space, jumps and breaks in musical logic, savage shifts of mood. Nowhere is his double personality more evident than in his remarkable cycle of piano sonatas. They show the composer at his most complex, most wayward, most searching; they are the blueprints of a new musical order he did not live to build.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941204","headline":"Respite From Holidays: Bach, Haydn and More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/nyregion/music-respite-from-holidays-bach-haydn-and-more.html","abstract":"  IT takes courage to present non-holiday concerts in December, but several such events are on the week's agenda.

The Goats played politically conscious, free-floating rap with deep roots in Philadelphia, and Big Chief made apocalyptic hard rock influenced almost exclusively by bands from its home state of Michigan.   The Goats are one of hip-hop's best live acts not just because they're actually a band (with a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist and an organist) but also because they find the right balance between their instinct to party and their desire to provide inner-city commentary on Washington politics. On Tuesday, the rappers known as Madd and Swayzack alternated between exchanging lines as if they were in a dialogue and shouting out phrases in unison. The music followed their lead, sinking into a slow funk groove during the dialoguelike verses and swelling into a cacophony of scratching records, riffing guitars and breakbeats during the choruses.    Where the Goats are influenced by lowdown funk and early heavy metal, Big Chief are obsessed by these styles. Its last album, \"Mack Avenue Skull Game,\" was a fake soundtrack that sounded as if it was scored by George Clinton.
