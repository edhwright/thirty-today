It can be a whisper, a growl, a croak; it suggests deathbed confidences or prophecies from beyond the grave. When Mr. Cohen sings a lover's promises, as he sometimes does, the words sound desperate and ominous.    Mr. Cohen, who is 58, has carried on a remarkably consistent career since his first album appeared in 1967. He writes stately, imagistic songs with zingers every few lines: \"It's lonely here, there's no one left to torture,\" he sings in the title song of his current album, \"The Future\" (Columbia). In early songs like \"Suzanne\" and \"Sisters of Mercy,\" romance and religiosity are intertwined; soon, his concerns about doom and salvation extended beyond the personal sphere, leading to profoundly cynical, black-humored litanies of bad news like \"Everybody Knows\" and \"There Is a War.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930616","headline":"Clinton Dithered.

Through that enormous opening in the wall, the view is breathtaking and horrific: set against the backdrop of the soft Tuscan hills and the great dome that Brunelleschi designed for the cathedral are the shattered red tile roofs of the buildings across the street from the Uffizi and the crumbled shell of an adjacent tower, in which a family killed in the explosion used to live. A few household belongings can still be seen on what remains of the tower's top floor, reduced to barely more than a roofless platform.

Kahn. The Advisory Council voted last week to ask Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to investigate whether the addition has received Federal assistance. Although construction on the addition is under way, the council's action could open the way for a formal review of its design.   The addition is being built on a site formerly occupied by a eucalyptus grove that formed a landscaped entrance to the laboratory complex. Since the institute unveiled the plan two years ago, it has been criticized by architects and historians who regard the Salk complex as one of the most important buildings of the 20th century and maintain that the landscaped setting is integral to Kahn's design.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930617","headline":"CHINA WINS FIGHT ON RIGHTS GROUPS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/world/china-wins-fight-on-rights-groups.html","abstract":"  In what was seen as a victory for China's campaign to limit international monitoring of human rights, nongovernmental organizations attending the World Conference on Human Rights were ejected today from the committee drafting the meeting's final document.

The Museum of Television and Radio decided, quite rightly, to focus on Mr. Irons's performances going back to the 1970's in \"Love for Lydia\" and continuing through, among other productions, \"Brideshead Revisited\" (1980-81) and \"Tales From Hollywood\" (1992). Not so coincidentally, Mr. Irons can be seen doing an especially intense turn on Bravo tomorrow night, at 7 and at 1:30 A.M., in the American premiere of the BBC production of \"The Dream\" (1990).    Adapted by Murray Watts from \"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man,\" Dostoyevsky's last short story, \"The Dream\" is a monologue. The Man -- admittedly, I'm always suspicious of characters called the Anything, but here it works -- sits in a mansionlike setting that could be either a home or an insane asylum. And he talks, directly to the camera. Staying remarkably close to the story, the Irons character begins by admitting that \"I am a ridiculous man,\" something he has known since the moment he was born. Then he tells us of the night, one November, when he decided to kill himself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Two Careers Close To Coming Full Circle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/sports/on-pro-basketball-two-careers-close-to-coming-full-circle.html","abstract":"  One has lasted 11 seasons; the other has toiled for 10.

The Grosvenor House Antiques Fair is the main attraction. For the social set, the 59-year-old show, which opened on June 9, falls neatly between the Derby and Ascot, and lovers of art and antiques flew in from all over the world for the gala on June 10. It is sandwiched between two new shows: the British Antique Dealers Association's fair, which took place in London just six weeks ago, and what dealers refer to as the \"Harrods Fair,\" the International Art and Antique Show, which opens on Nov. 11 on the department store's third floor.   Competition is always daunting, even for so well-established a show as Grosvenor House. So was the prospect of another bleak season, but the mood among dealers has been surprisingly upbeat. Quite a change from the close of last year's fair, when 18 dealers (nearly 20 percent of those participating) dropped out, saying they just hadn't made enough money.

The Pattern and Decorative movement of the 1970's tried to effect a truce, but negotiations faltered in the 80's. A furniture-as-art vogue came and went overnight, and craft objects showed up in the work of consumerist artists like Jeff Koons and Haim Steinbach chiefly for their irony value. The present trend toward multiculturalism might reconcile the two categories, and exhibitions like \"Africa Explores\" at the Center (now Museum) for African Art a few years ago demonstrated how it could be done. But crossover figures in New York City galleries are still rare.   All of which gives \"Glass Installations,\" at the American Craft Museum, more than usual interest. The six participating artists have created large-scale, site-specific installations from glass, a medium long identified with discrete functional forms and highly specialized techniques. In doing so, they obscure -- with varying degrees of success -- the line between traditional craft and the kind of politically and psychologically motivated installation art popular today. While none of the work in the show is earthshakingly radical -- in fact, some of it feels vaguely familiar and expressively tepid -- it represents a step in an interesting direction, and a good one for the American Craft Museum to be taking at this time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Rhode Island Governor Settles Paternity Suit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/us/rhode-island-governor-settles-paternity-suit.html","abstract":"  Gov.

People are foxes (who know many things) or hedgehogs (who know one big thing); Apollonians (advocates of order and classical discipline) or Dionysians (revelers in the romantic and the extreme). Writers are palefaces (genteel surveyors of sensibility, like Henry James) or redskins (raucous explorers of the outer limits, like Melville). One is \"in\" or \"out\"; in Nancy Mitford's words, \"U\" or \"Non-U.\" Or, as Ken Kesey once put it, you're either on the bus or off the bus.   Recently, however, such amusing distinctions have given way to more serious efforts to pigeonhole the world, efforts that underscore our tendency to see everything in terms of either-or, all-or-nothing, left-or-right. Teen-agers used to ask each other, \"Are you a fan of the Stones or the Beatles?\" John or Paul? Those innocuous questions, used to categorize one as a human being, have been replaced by similarly reductive -- but considerably more loaded -- litmus tests: Are you \"pro life\" or \"pro choice\"? Are you for unemployed loggers or endangered spotted owls? Do you believe Anita Hill or Clarence Thomas?

It would be stretching things to say that the medium is making a comeback, although it's about time: like the Democrats, painting has been out of office for so long that, in theory, it ought to be able to do some good. But it does seem that painting has a higher priority among young entry-level artists than it has had in recent seasons. With several galleries mounting painting shows concentrating on younger painters, re-election could be just around the corner.    Although these shows hardly represent the full range of painting being done at the moment, even by the younger generation, they do provide some interesting signals about the medium's direction. Cartoons, usually mixed with abstract elements, are especially hot, as are high-key fluorescent colors, which give some of these shows an undeniable visual bounce. Variations on the all-over composition, whose roots go back to Jackson Pollock's abstract drip paintings, continue to proliferate, often made of tiny semi-legible images.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"At Elizabeth High School; A 'Benevolent Despot' Still Speaks His Mind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/sports/at-elizabeth-high-school-a-benevolent-despot-still-speaks-his-mind.html","abstract":"  \"I was the black kid of my generation,\" said the man called Coach. \"Rahway was a Waspy place and I'm half Italian, half Albanian.

But Senators retreated because of the political climate, which seems to demand deficit cutting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930618","headline":"PRESIDENT SOFTENS OPPOSITION BY U.S. TO DIVIDED BOSNIA","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/world/president-softens-opposition-by-us-to-divided-bosnia.html","abstract":"  President Clinton signaled tonight that the United States might accept a partition of Bosnia that would allow the Serbs to keep land they seized by force, provided that Bosnian Muslims and Croats agreed to such a plan.   Mr. Clinton, speaking in the East Room of the White House at his first evening news conference, said he still preferred a \"multi-ethnic state\" in Bosnia. But he said for the first time that \"if the parties themselves agree, genuinely and honestly agree, the United States would have to look very seriously\" at the three-way partition plan proposed by the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia.  [ Excerpts from the news conference, page A19. ] Only Practical Solution    Until tonight, the Clinton Administration said it would never endorse such an alteration of internationally recognized borders by force. But American officials now acknowledge that such partition is probably the only practical solution, given that neither Washington nor its European allies are ready to use force to hold Bosnia together and that the Bosnian Muslims do not have the power to do so alone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930618","time":"1993-06-18
