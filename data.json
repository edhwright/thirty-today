The Americans went ahead on goals by Chris Henderson in the 20th minute, Peter Vermes in the 36th minute and Dominic Kinnear in the 51st. But Jose Dolgetta scored in the 65th and 77th minutes and Miguel Echanaussi in the final minute. The United States, 2-8-10 this year, was playing for the first time in the America Cup, South America's biennial championship. The Americans, who are missing most of their good players, previously lost to Uruguay, 1-0, and Ecuador, 2-0, and had been the only team not to score in the tournament. The tie clinched advancement to the quarterfinals for Uruguay (1-0-1), which played Ecuador late last night. Venezuela (0-1-2) is unlikely to advance as one of the two-best third-place teams because of a minus-5 goal differential.

Garrison-Jackson had a dozen family members and friends standing on the edge of Court 4 as she scampered on her favorite surface.

Though it is just minutes away by foot from the Loop, the cavernous convention center is so isolated from the rest of Chicago by the traffic streaming past that most visitors arrive and depart by taxi or bus.  Intentionally or not, the building is a perfect example of the problem addressed over the weekend by the more than 6,000 architects who gathered at McCormick Place: the extent to which architecture has contributed to the global environmental crisis.   Automobile traffic is only part of the problem. Roughly half the world's energy consumption goes into the construction, maintenance and operation of buildings. Architects don't initiate this gross consumption, but some of them have begun to recognize that design can help curtail it.  The choice of building materials, use of renewable resources like natural light and ventilation, and controlled patterns of suburban growth are some of the strategies architects can adopt toward what is called sustainable development: design that provides shelter without environmental or human exploitation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930623","headline":"Legislative Chiefs Agree to Extend Rent Rules Briefly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/nyregion/legislative-chiefs-agree-to-extend-rent-rules-briefly.html","abstract":"  For the second time in a week, Senate and Assembly leaders agreed today to extend the state's rent regulations for a brief period while they continue discussing whether to weaken regulations on certain luxury apartments.

It was not the last time an audience decided James wasn't much of a showman, and he soon returned to what he did best: writing novels and tales of exquisite subtlety. But he always longed for large public acclaim, and finally, curiously, belatedly, James found his mass audience on film.   There is nothing Hollywood would call high-concept in his fiction. His characters' most dramatic moments often exist in what they see or think or sense, or think they possibly might have seen or sensed. Isabel Archer's wedding in \"The Portrait of a Lady\" is an absolute nonevent that takes place between chapters, nothing compared to the quiet moment when she realizes her husband has deceived her. And James's career is filled with heroes whose most energetic action is running from their own emotions. Yet film makers as different as William Wyler, Francois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette and James Ivory have been gloriously inspired by James, in unpredictable ways.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930625","headline":"Reno and F.B.I.

One is to bring New York into compliance with the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act, which obliges states to impose stricter air quality controls on cars and factories. Failure to act could cost the state $800 million a year in Federal highway aid, and Washington is losing patience with Albany's sloth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930625","headline":"Step Right Up!

A day after only six players broke par on the TPC at River Highlands course during a celebrity pro-am because of wind gusting to 25 miles an hour. (AP) YACHT RACING  New Winners in Day 4  Shifting winds off the Rhode Island coast yesterday stirred up a new set of winners in the fourth day of Block Island Race Week. Merrythought, the 62-foot sloop owned by Jack King of Annapolis, Md., edged the 50-foot Infinity out of the overall big-boat lead. Sailing aboard Merrythought was Gary Jobson, an America's Cup veteran. Both boats were designed by Bruce Farr of Annapolis, but Merrythought is 10 years older. Racing for the first time this month, Infinity, owned by John Thomson, of Port Washington, L.I., has been the favorite to win its class at Block Island. In another upset, Blue Yankee, a 43-foot sloop owned by Robert Towse, of Stamford, Conn., took over the lead in Class 2 from the 43-foot Barrister III. Eddie-Warden Owen, the top-ranked match-racer from England, sailed on Blue Yankee. BOXING  Knockout for Snipes  Renaldo Snipes, a 36-year-old former heavyweight contender on the comeback trail, made his fourth payday in the last three years pay off last night at the Paramount, where Madison Square Boxing staged its next-to-last program. The 215-pound Snipes raised his career record to 39-7-1 by scoring his 22d knockout, stopping Eddy Curry, a 193-pound cruiserweight, at 2 minutes 16 seconds of the third round. Snipes, a popular local fighter out of Yonkers, is hoping to be invited back to the last Garden-promoted card, scheduled for July 8. He floored Larry Holmes in his only title shot, a World Boxing Council challenge in 1981. But a controversial long count allowed the champion to get up, and then Holmes knocked out Snipes in the 11th round. In last night's featured bout, Lamar Parks, ranked among middlweight contenders by the W.B.C., came back from a first-round knockdown to win a unanimous decision over Danny Garcia of San Juan, P.R.

But ballets involve more than technique. Many of Balanchine's works are filled with such powerful images of yearning, passion and turmoil that it is possible to argue that he was temperamentally a Romanticist.   He certainly wore his Romantic heart on his sleeve in 1980 when he created \"Ballade\" and \"Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze,' \" both of which were presented by the New York City Ballet on Wednesday night as part of its Balanchine Celebration at the New York State Theater.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930625","headline":"Attacks Focus the Spotlight On Kurds' Tangled Affairs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/25/world/attacks-focus-the-spotlight-on-kurds-tangled-affairs.html","abstract":"  The attacks by Kurdish separatists on Turkish installations in Europe today reflected a tactical shift by a Marxist group that has been fighting a little-heeded, but violent, guerrilla war in remote southeastern Turkey for more than nine years.   The assaults in Western Europe propelled the separatist message to a far broader audience. They also evoked the tangles of expediency and ethnic passions that have been molding the destinies of some 20 million Kurds who form minorities in parts of Turkey, Iran, Syria and Iraq, the heart of one of the world's most volatile regions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930625","headline":"A Window on Shopping in Tokyo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/25/style/IHT-a-window-on-shopping-in-tokyo.html","abstract":"It may not be the cheapest place to shop, but just looking in this city is a feast for the eyes.

Twenty-three people have served as prime ministers. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the governor general of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But if that leader lacks the support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930625","time":"1993-06-25
