Bobby, as he is called by everybody tonight (James F.

Mr. Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born auto worker, was accused a decade ago of being the sadistic guard \"Ivan the Terrible\" of Treblinka, the death camp in Poland where nearly a million Jews were exterminated.

The orchestrations, which Overton and Monk worked on, are loaded with wit, and accurate: on \"I Mean You,\" high riffs, played with soprano saxophone and clarinet, mimic Monk's own high-register tinkling, and the music is rife with his funny dissonances and wryness that constitute a large portion of Monk's legacy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930805","headline":"U.S. Informer Is New Suspect In Bomb Plot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/05/nyregion/us-informer-is-new-suspect-in-bomb-plot.html","abstract":"  A 33-year-old fugitive who had been questioned by the F.B.I. and released almost immediately after the bombing of the World Trade Center was indicted yesterday as a new conspirator in the explosion, with Federal authorities charging that he helped mix explosive chemicals in the month leading up to the bombing.

Giving shelter to people in need has been an Albanian tradition that benefited many Montenegrins and Bosnians before World War II, the Jewish community when our country was occupied by the Nazis and numerous Greeks who fled into Albania in the late 1940's because of the political and military circumstances in their homeland.   Now, as other European, Middle Eastern and Asian countries have done, Albania is receiving thousands of refugees from Bosnia, mostly women and children, despite very limited resources. But this only and nothing else is foreseen in the various Albanian talks and agreements with the Bosnian authorities. The Albanian Government would never allow any use of these camps for other purposes and will provide access there for anybody who might want to check them.   As for the Albanian negative vote to the admission of Macedonia into the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it is only conditioned by the failing of the Macedonian Government to give the Albanian community living there the rights it was committed to give, such as proportional representation in the state apparatus, more schools, an Albanian university and more access in the national news media.   Furthermore, the Albanians in Macedonia are crucially supporting the internal stability of that young state. Many international community leaders have publicly recognized that the Republic of Albania, with its commitment to peace and to easing tensions, its opposition to any violent change of borders and its realistic policy, has made a major contribution to stability in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula.

Not that this eight-month-old spot doesn't attract its nightly share of the gorgeous downtown crowd, but, as the name Frontiere -- French for border -- indicates, the restaurant toes a line between sincerity and fashionable exhibitionism and manages to unite the best of both worlds.   Similarly, Frontiere leaves behind culinary and design cliches. The menu, with dishes like \"la charcuterie del giorno\" suggests a melding of the bordering cuisines of southern France and northern Italy, though the food is not restricted to that area. Andrew Nathan, the 29-year-old owner and chef, offers food that is fresh, flavorful and direct, prepared with confidence and unburdened by excessive touches of creative whimsy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"Sherrard: Fancy Step For Giants On Offense","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/sports/football-sherrard-fancy-step-for-giants-on-offense.html","abstract":"  Mike Sherrard and Mark Jackson knew everything about each other even before they met.

Electronic toll collection involves advance payment by a motorist, who is then issued a small tag to paste inside the windshield. A computer reads the tag each time the car goes through an electronic gate, and deducts the toll from the prepaid account. When an account runs low, the tag-holder replenishes it, or additional payment can be withdrawn automatically from the tag-holder's bank account.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"Delahoussaye Rides His 5,000 Winners Into Hall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/sports/horse-racing-notebook-delahoussaye-rides-his-5000-winners-into-hall.html","abstract":"  Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode A.P.

Regrettably, no comparable sense of environmental stewardship burdens the corporate managers and captains of some of the huge cruise ships that ply America's offshore waters. Conservation groups estimate that of the seven million tons of waste illegally dumped into the oceans, 15 percent can be traced to cruise ships.   Lately, however, tourists with a strong conscience and a talent for undercover work have offered hope. An article in The Times last week reported that Princess Cruise Lines recently paid a record $500,000 fine after pleading guilty to illegal dumping. The crucial evidence was supplied by a Michigan couple, Alvin and Marilyn Levett, who videotaped the crew of the Royal Princess hurling plastic bags into the sea off the Florida Keys. Under a Federal whistle-blowers' program, the couple received half the fine, or $250,000.
