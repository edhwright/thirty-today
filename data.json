So fierce are the anti-Castro passions of well-heeled, conservative Cuban exiles that reason flies out the window when candidates vie for their votes, and PAC contributions. That helps explain why Congress last year added new teeth to an existing trade embargo by barring U.S. subsidiaries in other countries from doing business with Cuba.   The Bush Administration at first questioned the prudence and legality of this step, but flipped around when Bill Clinton, while barnstorming in Florida, accused the Administration of missing \"a big opportunity to put the hammer down on Fidel Castro and Cuba.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931108","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/08/nyregion/metro-digest-119793.html","abstract":"  ALBANY AND GIULIANI: ROUGH PATH AHEAD?

Still, despite the unstoppable momentum of many of the Socialist initiatives, particularly the major Paris building projects known as the Grands Travaux, Mr. Toubon is trying hard to make his mark after seven months on the job. He has had his identity problems, especially outside the French press: he was recently referred to as Troubon and Tourbon in two English-language newspapers.

But after letting its performance series slide for nearly 20 years, to become a casualty of changing policies and campus overcrowding, Hunter is getting back into the business with a vengeance.

During the campaign, he promised to \"end welfare as we know it\" by making benefits temporary. No wonder then that the Administration granted its approval for Wisconsin's plan last week.   But a closer look shows that the two policies veer in starkly different directions. Mr. Clinton wants to guarantee a job for parents who reach the end of the two-year period; Wisconsin doesn't. Mr. Clinton pledges generous education and training programs before the benefits run out; Wisconsin doesn't. And Mr. Clinton's advisers recognize that for welfare reform to work, it must protect children from penalties meted out to delinquent parents; Wisconsin doesn't.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931108","headline":"For Giuliani, Big Job in Albany: Separating Friends From the Foes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/08/nyregion/for-giuliani-big-job-in-albany-separating-friends-from-the-foes.html","abstract":"  For Rudolph W.

And when it was all over, after Mr. Moynihan had thoroughly whupped him, the Republicans in the White House asked Mr. McMillan what he wanted for falling on his sword.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931109","headline":"Cabdriver Shot Dead On Staten Island","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/09/nyregion/cabdriver-shot-dead-on-staten-island.html","abstract":"  A livery-cab driver was shot and killed yesterday afternoon near a Staten Island housing project, the police said.

The books, along with false passports and identification cards, were introduced by prosecutors as they continued to build their case against Ahmad Ajaj, one of the four defendants in the case. Mr. Ajaj is accused of having brought the bomb-making manuals to Kennedy International Airport when he arrived on a flight from Pakistan on Sept. 1, 1992. He was arrested on passport violations and has been in prison ever since.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931110","headline":"GRAZING FEES CUT FROM SENATE BILL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/10/us/grazing-fees-cut-from-senate-bill.html","abstract":"  Unable to break a filibuster by Western lawmakers, the Senate today abandoned its effort to raise grazing fees and tighten environmental rules for use of Federal lands. But in doing so, it freed the Clinton Administration to impose even higher grazing fees and stricter environmental regulations on its own.

Laborers and executives, blacks and whites, young and old sat together during prayers, lining up afterward for a blessing from a relic of St. Jude, the patron saint of impossible causes.   Attendance at the devotions has doubled at the Manhattan church in the last six years, just one sign of the popularity of this dedication of prayers to a saint who, despite having been one of Christ's 12 Apostles, had been obscure until a priest in Chicago erected a shrine to St. Jude. It has become one of the most durable American devotions, with numerous prayer services that attract even non-Catholics. There are also countless tiny newspaper ads by worshipers that read \"Thank you, St. Jude, \" and there is even a St. Jude chain letter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931110","headline":"Magical Poufs of Air, Souffles Become Even More Elusive","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/10/style/magical-poufs-of-air-souffles-become-even-more-elusive.html","abstract":"SOUFFLES belong to a different era of French cooking, along with coq au vin and canard a l'orange, traditional dishes knocked off their pedestals by nouvelle cuisine.\n\nEven in New York, with thousands of restaurants, the number of souffle sources is down to a dozen or so -- mostly old school, East Side restaurants with chefs who create perfect examples of this classic yet elusive dessert.
