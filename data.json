A year ago, Nigeria's generals decided to allow their people a whiff of democracy under highly controlled circumstances. Two political parties were formed under military tutelage; two carefully screened candidates were allowed to contest the presidency. Even so, when voters failed to approve the regime's first choice, the military ruler broke his promises, annulled the election and robbed the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, of victory.    The result has been a grass-roots pro-democratic uprising that the current military clique has been unable to quell. The crisis deepened a few weeks ago when Mr. Abiola, a Muslim and millionaire with a following in Nigeria's non-Muslim south, proclaimed himself President on the first anniversary of the canceled election. For that he was charged with treason, held incommunicado and threatened with a life sentence. When a federal high court judge twice ordered the military to produce Mr. Abiola in open court, the junta ignored the order.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Sound-Art Installation Closes Early in Paris","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/arts/sound-art-installation-closes-early-in-paris.html","abstract":"  \"Sound Island,\" a sound-art installation at the Arc de Triomphe by Bill Fontana, an American, has closed, seven weeks before its planned late-August termination.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee want to know, and over the last three days they have poked into unusual corners of Judge Stephen G. Breyer's life to find out. Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, looked for literary landmarks. Judge Breyer's response spoke volumes.    Q. Tell me your favorite books.   A. Where do people start? They start with Shakespeare. Say why Shakespeare and you say why -- -- this I tell students, you know, a lot of them come from some different school and they'll come from some place, they say, 'What's in Shakespeare for me?' You say, 'Well, if you're willing to put in the time, he's a little bit archaic, you know, the language, but if you put in the time, what you see there is, you see every different person, you see every different kind of person, you see every situation there is in the world. You see people saying things that they would say if only they had that ability to say them. And you see the whole thing in poetry.'   I mean, that's why people turn to that and they turn to that a little bit in literature to get some of the things that Senator  [ Paul ]  Simon was talking about, I think, which is what's in the heart of that person who is leading that different kind of life. And sometimes you can find some of that in literature.   I like Conrad very much. Why? I think because I'm moved often by the way in which he talks about the need for people -- all of us -- to learn from the past and then to give something to the future. Whether that's through our families or whether that's through our careers, we do learn from our parents, we do learn from the past, we do try to transmit things of value. And I think he finds value in human communities. I think he finds human communities to be ultimately the sources of obligations and values toward each other.   I read something that moved me a lot not very long ago. I was reading something by Chesterton, and he was talking about one of the Brontes, I think her \"Jane Eyre.\" He says you go and look out at the city -- I think he was looking at London -- and he said you know, you see all those houses now, even at the end of the 19th century, and they look all as if they're the same. And you think all those people are out there going to work and they're all the same.    He says, but what Bronte tells you is they're not the same. Each one of those persons in each one of those houses and each one of those families is different, and they each have a story to tell. Each of those stories involves something about human passion. Each of those stories involves a man, a woman, children, families, work, lives -- and you get that sense out of the book.    And so sometimes I've found literature very helpful as a way out of the tower.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Hulk Hogan, on Witness Stand, Tells of Steroid Use in Wrestling","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/nyregion/hulk-hogan-on-witness-stand-tells-of-steroid-use-in-wrestling.html","abstract":"  He is famous as the flamboyant wrestler Hulk Hogan.

Updated from the 1951 film starring Paul Douglas as George Knox, a hard-hearted baseball coach, the new version has a glowering Danny Glover in the role of Knox, who is now the bitter, scowling manager of the California Angels.    The Angels, who are in last place, are so bad that their playing is buffoonish. But with some unexpected heavenly intervention, they begin performing wondrous feats. What transforms the team from pathetic clowns into heroic ones is a little boy's fervent prayer. When Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an 11-year-old foster child, hears his father, a drifter, sarcastically remark that the chances of the family's reuniting are as good as those of the Angels winning the pennant, the boy takes it as a promise. That night, Roger prays to a star for the Angels to win the pennant, and it twinkles back at him. The very next day, winged, white-robed seraphim, visible only to Roger, appear in the stadium to help the players make impossible catches, hit crucial home runs and throw some of the fastest balls ever pitched.

As Mayor of this city, where the Brazilian soccer team has stayed during the World Cup games, he is ready to become nothing less than a patron saint in Brazil if the team beats Italy in the finals on Sunday.\n\nFor a month, the Mayor and the 30,000 residents of Los Gatos, 50 miles south of San Francisco, have learned that the World Cup is not a matter of life or death. It is much more than that to the Brazilian fans who partied all night for days on end, ignoring the police in riot gear and the local drinking laws. Los Gatos residents now know how to say hello in Portuguese (Oi). They also know who Romario, Bebeto and Branco are. And they now call the game football, not soccer. \n\nAnd what if Brazil wins on Sunday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena? \"I'll be taken back to Rio that night and they'll teach me how to really party,\" the 46-year-old Mayor and air-conditioner salesman said. \n\nHe has already had some lessons in Los Gatos, where the Brazilians' nonstop samba dancing on the streets angered some residents. There was the time that Brazilian drumming kept punctuating a concert of John Philip Sousa marching songs. There was also the the dispute over whether Brazilian women could wear string bikinis in the streets of this quiet, well-to-do bedroom community of Victorian houses.\n\nSandy Eddy, president of the Downtown Association and owner of a second-hand store, said the town was in conflict on the Fourth of July, when Brazil played and beat the American team. That night, the police said, 30,000 people, Brazilians, Americans and other soccer fans, came to town for a spontaneous party. \n\nBut residents are no longer torn. The green Brazilian flags are hanging in store windows. And although banners are prohibited, a sign stretches across the main thoroughfare: \"Los Gatos Wishes the Brasilian Team Good Luck! Boa Sorte!\"\n\n\"We have become Brazil's parent,\" Ms. Eddy said. \"It is like our child is out there who we have supported for two months.\"\n\nThe story of how the team chose Los Gatos as its American headquarters has been repeated so often it has taken on mythic proportions. The Mayor said Brazilian dignitaries and football officials who came to the area in the winter to look for lodging for the team were unhappy with the frenetic atmosphere in San Francisco and San Jose, the two biggest cities near the Stanford Stadium, where the team played most of its games. \n\nThe delegation came to lunch at a Los Gatos restaurant, Cafe Marcella, which had closed after lunch that day but reopened for the Brazilians. The waiters, said to be soccer nuts, showered the visitors with attention and won them over.\n\nSecurity was important to the team, so officials found the Lodge for Villa Felice, a small, family-owned place in a residential neighborhood surrounded by a wall. \n\nWhen Mayor Attaway heard the Brazilian team had booked rooms in town, he wrote to the Brazilian consulate in San Francisco to ask if the team would put on a soccer demonstration for local children. His request was rejected. \n\nSo the Mayor decided to go to Brazil personally and ask the head of the soccer federation if the team would reconsider. It was his first trip outside the United States. When he arrived, he was shuttled to a news conference, where about 40 reporters grilled him about everything, from what he knew about soccer to how he would handle drunken Brazilians. He knew little about soccer, he admitted, and as for drunken people, he would tell the police to unite them with friends who were sober.\n\nA reporter accused him of evading the question. It was at that moment, Mr. Attaway said, that he understood the seriousness of the World Cup to Brazilians.\n\n\"Is this really happening to me?\" he asked himself at the time. \"I'm a small-town Mayor. I don't have a college degree and I've been thrown into an international situation.\"\n\nMr. Attaway did cause something of an international incident when he was asked whether the town would permit women to wear skimpy string bikinis popular in Brazil. The Mayor's answer was equivocal: \"We want to be good hosts but we also need to protect our residents. We want to do something that our families could appreciate.\"\n\nBrazilian headlines declared that Los Gatos had outlawed bikinis: \"Los Gatos proibe biquini em festa.\" The Mayor denied that such a law existed and insured the rights of Brazilians to wear their traditional bikinis. \n\nThe team arrived on May 26, about a month before the games began. During their practice, they gave the soccer demonstration for the town's children. In all the time they were in town, no one was arrested for indecent exposure. \n\nAfter the players checked out of the lodge on July 6 and headed for Los Angeles for the final games, Brazilian tourists started coming, asking where Romario, the star, stayed (Room 211), what the players bought in town (electronics) and how many times the staff had to do laundry for them (twice a day). At the front desk, the team members left a clay doll, which they said was their guardian angel. A clock in the front office still keeps Brazilian time, four hours ahead.\n\nSome residents, however, were relieved to see the Brazilians go. Dave Knapp, the town manager, said there were several complaints about the big party on the Fourth of July. \"The party happened,\" he said. \"We knew it would happen. You can't plan a hurricane, you can only prepare for it.\"\n\nThe grumblers may feel differently after Sunday.

Distinguished by the gleeful, high-pitched chirping of female singers, reggaelike rhythms and the melodies of the three-stringed, banjolike sanshin, the music of the island -- Japan's southernmost prefecture -- has been steadily gaining popularity in the rest of Japan. It might be the first Japanese roots music that the country's youth, typically enamored with American pop, has embraced. The result is comparable to what happened in Britain in the 60's as musicians like Mick Jagger, John Mayall and Eric Clapton discovered the blues, enabling older blues masters to recharge their careers.   Now interest in Okinawan music is picking up in the United States. Shoukichi Kina, known as the father of modern Okinawan music, is to perform in New York for the first time tomorrow afternoon at Central Park Summerstage, midpark at 72d Street.

Verdi, contracted to produce a work for La Scala, disliked the libretto and worked unenthusiastically. While he was composing, both he and his wife fell ill, and his wife died. Both audience and critics disliked the opera at its premiere in 1840, and it was immediately pulled from the repertory. And Verdi found the exercise so depressing that he considered giving up composition. The best he could say for the work, decades later, was that equally poor operas by other composers have fared better.   He had a point. \"Un Giorno di Regno\" may be two hours of chirpy, formulaic music of numbing triviality, but works with similar attributes by Rossini and Donizetti have become repertory staples.

It is pop's job to carry that music -- or at least its most accessible efforts -- from the periphery to the broader public.    Starting on Tuesday, bands from all over the United States converge on New York City, hoping to be heard by taste makers and music moguls in town for the New Music Seminar. It's a five-day suspension of the new rules in rock, which decree that a regional following is better than a glimmer of national attention.

His clothes typically use high-tech fabrics and clean tailoring, but with a rock-and-roll edge. In the last year, the Lang influence has been inescapable in glossy magazines and on other designers' runways: satiny and silky sheens, deft touches of glitter, simple silhouettes. Fashion insiders are calling it \"the new glamour.\" He wishes they wouldn't. Q.  Why are there so many Helmut Lang rip-offs this season?  A.  I give that question back to you. That's your role in this industry, to define this kind of movement; it's not mine. I'm just doing it.  Q.  You don't like people using past references to describe your style. Why? A.  Because the past has nothing to do with it. It's all about today. We all know there is a history, and we all have our own history and past. There can be some references, but you can't always compare everything using the same old images and the same feelings. I think the history and the past we have is just an energy we've built up to do what we do now.  Q.  Your success has come from a steady evolution of your style. Does fashion try to change too much each season?  A: If something is good, it doesn't go out of style every six months. The fashion wheel of today doesn't have to go as quickly as it was pushed in the 80's. Q.  Culturally, why do you think this \"new glamour\" movement is happening now? A.  Simplicity, deconstruction, was what we had the moment before glamour, and it was celebrated like a religion. That caused the change. It's never good to exaggerate a movement. When that happens with glamour, when it's overexaggerated, we'll go quickly to something else.  Q.  How is this glamour different from yesterday's? A.  The difference is it's more mature. It's more mature than the glamour of the 80's, when it was important to be sun-tanned, before we knew what the sun could do to us. Today, it is being able to show you can play with sophistication. Q.  So, are designers forcing too much change? A.  I don't even think it's only the designers who influence it anymore. It's the media and what they promote to their readers. If there's one lipstick in your bathroom, you're out of fashion, or another, you're in fashion. We should have progressed much more at this point.  Q.  But obviously, since the new cry is \"glamour,\" you're profiting. How would you prefer to see magazines handle trends?  A.  The media is looking every season for a designer to tell a story. I have a long story I have to tell, continuing fluently year after year. I don't think I'm the one that invented glamour at all. I just built up my style year by year. I'm just lucky that the times are coming closer to what I do. But that wasn't the purpose of my work, to establish a new glamour. I do what I do. It has to do with my personality and my life, and I'm not thinking of what kind of provocation or sensation I want to make with my next collection. That wouldn't be a very good basis for a collection. I just try to do very honest, good clothes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Elizabeth Skinner, N. M.

THE early-music world, being as fashion driven as anything else, was bound to see the day when incremental course corrections, in matters of sound and technique, would give way to radical sea changes.

Brian Asawa, the 27-year old countertenor who will sing Handel and Gluck at the Mostly Mozart Festival on Saturday evening, is one of several young male altos who think more about ravishing the ear than about the niceties of Baroque style, yet who manage to have it both ways.

But one leaves this book of black-and white landscapes, literary portraits, abstract-looking nudes and studies of English upper-class and lower-class life wondering just what makes Bill Brandt Bill Brandt. What links the man who in 1944 took a striking shot of an unhappy couple sitting at a pub with the man who in 1957 photographed an East Sussex landscape dominated by a large human ear? Why are the linkages in Brandt's work so unclear? A partial explanation is given in the introductory essay by the British art historian Ian Jeffries, who calls Brandt \"Britain's greatest photographer of the modern era.\" He says that many of Brandt's works, particularly those that appeared in his socialogical studies \"The English at Home\" and \"A Night in London,\" were intended as a series of photographs whose meaning depended on their juxtaposition -- a photograph of a coal miner at work was meant to go next to a shot of the coal miner's hard-bitten family at home without him. Even when Brandt (1904-83) was on assignment for magazines, Mr. Jeffries says, he often became \"engrossed or seduced by motifs.\" Here, one gets an occasional glimpse of Brandt's juxtapositions. There is, for instance, an eerie trio of photographs under the title \"The Magic Lantern of a Car's Headlights.\" But many of the photographs here are stripped from their intended context. That does not completely explain the uneasiness of this retrospective, though. The uncanniness of Brandt's art, as Mr. Jeffries points out, is the suggestion \"That what is ostensibly on show is not the whole story, that all those motifs are part of a larger, secret scheme, a private universe to which we are on the point of gaining access.\" SARAH BOXER","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Looking Back on the Art Of the Puppetmaster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/looking-back-on-the-art-of-the-puppetmaster.html","abstract":"SENSES are assaulted and assuaged with heraldic, brightly colored figures darting in every direction in \"Hidden Treasures: A Glimpse of Puppet Masterworks From the University of Connecticut,\" an exhibition at the William Benton Museum of Art at UConn in Storrs through Aug. 7.\n\nAlmost 300 marionettes, glove, rod and shadow puppets are in procession down the center of the gallery, poised on shelves and stages and dangling from walls.

Since that initial, rough attempt, water slides and the parks that contain them have become increasingly elaborate. In 1976 one of the first fiberglass slides appeared at Disney World's River Country. A year later Wet 'n Wild, considered the country's first full-scale water park -- and still billed as the most popular, with more than a million visitors a year -- opened in Orlando, Fla.

Tewell won a virtually unanimous vote as the new senior minister.    Fifth Avenue, whose 2,200 members and $3.5 million budget make it the city's largest Presbyterian church, is nearly two centuries old. For four years in the late 1980's and early 90's, its fortunes soared and then plunged under the Rev. R.

Slippery Slopes -- four separate undulating slides, each 70 feet long -- are the tamest of the three major rides. Jessica and my wife, Susan, prefer Sesame Streak, which consists of three flumes, each 200 feet long; riders sit on inner tubes, twisting in and out of tunnels before splashing down in a pool. Runaway Rapids is a single 300-foot flume with lots of twists, turns and a bumpy bottom to simulate (vaguely) river rapids.

Although he recorded prolifically, Monteux, the French-American maestro, wasn't so fecund as Toscanini, the Italian, and most of his records from the 1960's were not for RCA.   Still, RCA's boxed set (09026-61893-2), mid-priced with the disks also available individually, is a cause for celebration. Monteux (1875-1964) was not the household name Toscanini was, partly because he hadn't the Italian's volcanic temperament and partly because between 1936 and 1952 (roughly Toscanini's tenure with the NBC Symphony in New York), Monteux was based in proud but provincial San Francisco. Still, Monteux won perhaps even wider respect and reverence from his fellow musicians, and his recordings -- even the inevitably selective sampling in this set -- hold up remarkably well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Microsoft's Grip on Software Loosened by Antitrust Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/us/microsoft-s-grip-on-software-loosened-by-antitrust-deal.html","abstract":"  The Microsoft Corporation, which thus far has reigned as the premier creator of software for personal computers, bowed before Federal antitrust regulators today and agreed to immediately abandon a number of its important sales practices, which the Government said had smothered competition.
