Realism, of course, is a slippery thing: now that a televised production from Rome has presented the work staged in the actual settings and at the right times of day, Mr. Zeffirelli's grandiose, intensely detailed sets look less like virtual reality and more like theatrical facsimiles. And say what one will about them, they are really distracting only when the singing and acting fail to command the attention.   That was not a problem on Wednesday. Luciano Pavarotti, who has been known to sleepwalk through \"Tosca\" in recent seasons, was in spectacular form as Cavaradossi. His voice sounded younger and fresher than it did a year ago, and he sang with a passion and magnetism that made his Cavaradossi a defiant hero. In his showpieces, \"Recondita armonia\" and \"E lucevan le stelle,\" he found an emotional depth that made the arias moving rather than merely crowd-pleasing. Smaller touches were equally effective: Cavaradossi's brief celebration of Napoleon's victory -- his shouted \"Vittoria! Vittoria!\" in the second act -- rarely has the spontaneity or the chilling power that Mr. Pavarotti brought to it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"From the Early Days, Images of a Voyager Who Died at 24","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/arts/photography-review-from-the-early-days-images-of-a-voyager-who-died-at-24.html","abstract":"  Until recently, the photography of the 19th century was like a lost continent, a semi-mythical place known largely through images whose subjects and makers were equally forgotten. In recent years, though, scholars have begun to retrieve the riches of early photography from the depths of time, assembling substantial bodies of work by major figures, uncovering details about their lives and researching the often arcane processes they used.   The fruits of some of those efforts are on view in New York City this month. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is featuring the work of Edouard Baldus, a French photographer famed for his commanding views of architecture and industrial forms in the 1850's; in SoHo, the James Danziger Gallery, in association with Hans P. Kraus Jr., is presenting the work of John B.

This is a world of androids and robots, created to ape humanity in its daily routines of commerce and domesticity. At its center is Mathew, a walking, whirring, clicking halfway house between sensitivity and automatic response. Within his artificial body stirs unresolved conflict between the human demiurges who have created him and the obedient machine he has become.

Neil Jenney (born in 1945) is one of them, and six of his chilly, immaculately executed paintings have been brought together as part of the Collection in Context series at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Organized by Elizabeth Sussman, the show leaves no doubt that Mr. Jenney is an artist overdue for reassessment, but it also suggests why he remains a marginal figure.    His debt to earlier American art is clear at a glance. His reiterated images of blasted trees and sunset skies, for example, were standard Hudson River School emblems of decay and renewal, fraught with allegorical implications. Mr. Jenney acknowledges the symbolic nature of his own paintings by stenciling their didactic-sounding titles directly onto their frames. The frames themselves -- thick, shelflike and painted black -- recall the prosceniumlike structures used by Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt to turn their landscape paintings into near-cinematic spectacles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"G.O.P.

Then the Mayor seemed to hesitate, saying he hoped the cuts would not be necessary. But they are. The police have their share of bloat and should be asked to shed it at a time when other vital services are being slashed.   It is important, however, that the Mayor make cuts in the right way. News reports suggest budget officials may want to shrink the department's civilian payroll by as much as one-third. That could actually weaken patrol strength, a perverse result of a law designed to strengthen policing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"Clinton Exults in Swift Success Of U.S. Military Force in Haiti","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/world/mission-haiti-washington-clinton-exults-swift-success-us-military-force-haiti.html","abstract":"  The House of Representatives early today passed a resolution approved Thursday by the Senate that gave the White House some measure of support for the American military mission in Haiti.

The lower house of Parliament, dominated by a coalition of former Communists and their allies, overwhelmingly passed a bill called the Official State Secrets Act, which would stifle the lively independent media that have grown up over the past four years. The upper house, with the same parties in control, was expected to approve the bill as well, perhaps as soon as this week.   But the Polish press fought back and, although the danger has not completely passed, the censors are now in retreat. Upper house action is stalled, lower house leaders are having second thoughts and President Lech Walesa promises to veto the bill if it reaches his desk in anything like its present form.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"From Postwar Italy, With Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/arts/art-review-from-postwar-italy-with-style.html","abstract":"  YOU needn't have cruised down the Via Veneto on a Vespa in the 1960's to know what is meant by la dolce vita.

Beginning in the late 50's, the country enjoyed what Italians considered to be a miracle of economic and industrial expansion after the degradation of the Fascist years. But the biggest miracle was the number of talented people who came to maturity after World War II and gave to resurging Italy a culture and style that reached a peak by the mid-60's.   \"The Italian Metamorphosis, 1943-1968,\" which fills the Guggenheim Museum, is a gigantic survey of what they accomplished in painting and sculpture, film and photography, fashion, architecture and design between the fall of Mussolini and the rise of a generation opposed to Italy's new opulence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"John Merriman, professor of history at Yale University, is reading \"Seducing the French\" by Richard F.

The strike was fated to fail because these advocates for the indigent were demanding the one form of compensation their follow citizens are unwilling to give them: respect.\n\nAt bottom, the issue that drove the nonprofit organization's lawyers to the street was not money but the way they are treated. Last spring, Legal Aid's management awarded itself a 4.5 percent raise (rescinded Thursday under pressure from Mayor Giuliani). In June, that management welcomed the Giuliani administration's plan to increase Legal Aid's share of criminal cases from 60 to 85 percent of the city's total. That would add tens of thousands of cases to the already crushing load borne by the organization's 780 criminal defense attorneys. Then, as the lawyers' contract came up for renewal, management announced that it had no money for a salary increase -- and, by the way, the employees would have to pay more for their health insurance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941008","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/08/nyregion/c-corrections-470597.html","abstract":"  An article in Business Day last Saturday, about a $1 billion loss at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. of Japan, misstated an estimate of the cost of shoring up two finance companies affiliated with the bank.

New groups will offer fresh approaches. But the new process was not rational. About 74 providers abruptly lost city support, including the Door, a respected group that helps runaway and homeless teen-agers, and the Y.W.C.A. of New York City, which runs the only citywide program for disabled teens. In their place are 99 new groups.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941008","headline":"Swiss Authorities Seek Cult's 2 Top Leaders on Homicide Charges in Followers' Deaths","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/08/world/swiss-authorities-seek-cult-s-2-top-leaders-homicide-charges-followers-deaths.html","abstract":"  Amid mounting evidence that some of the 48 members of a religious sect found dead here on Wednesday were murdered and did not commit suicide, the Swiss police said today that the two top leaders of the group were wanted on suspicion of premeditated homicide and arson.

CUOMO BATTLES FOR QUEENS VOTES Governor Cuomo had no trouble persuading his borough to send him to Albany once, twice, even three times. But as he requests a fourth term, he is finding that his homely expression about trust and doubt carries a double meaning, for there is no longer much enthusiasm for Mario Cuomo in Queens. He will probably win the borough again next month, both professional and amateur analysts predict. But he may do so by default, and with a far more slender margin than he has previously enjoyed.

CHIASSON What happens is that because health center districts are fairly small and the number of infant deaths is quite small in each of the districts, the rates are very unstable. And if you look at, for instance, just a simple graph of the infant mortality rate in Central Harlem over time, you'll see that the actual line bounces up and down all over the place. . . .

Let's face it: music is universal the way food is universal. One culture's symbol of home and hearth is another's rotten cabbage.   Does Mr. Taruskin really have scientific proof that atonality stinks? Of course not. He glibly invokes the recent work of cognitive psychologists, but that work is more concerned with how we recognize our mothers than how we recognize art. It will be a long time, if ever, before scientists claim authority on such issues as esthetic judgment. When he misappropriates their research to declare certain cultural artifacts unnatural, Mr. Taruskin, far from announcing to us the latest musical discoveries, is in fact reviving the most notorious attacks on modernism of the past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"POSTINGS: Historic Documents on View; When Chelsea Was Farmland","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/realestate/postings-historic-documents-on-view-when-chelsea-was-farmland.html","abstract":"  As New Yorkers grew more agitated in the 1980's about unwanted buildings in their neighborhoods, the term Nimby was coined to describe the sentiment: \"Not in my back yard.\"   New research has uncovered what might be called the Nimfy syndrome -- \"Not in my farm yard\" -- in the 1840's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"As She Lay Dying","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/books/as-she-lay-dying.html","abstract":"  SCAR TISSUE  By Michael Ignatieff. 199 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"There's Something About a Woman in Uniform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/books/there-s-something-about-a-woman-in-uniform.html","abstract":"  HOLLYWOOD KIDS  By Jackie Collins. 525 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $23.50.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Baby, You're the Greatest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/books/baby-youre-the-greatest.html","abstract":"LOVE, ALICE \nMy Life as a Honeymooner.\nBy Audrey Meadows with Joe Daley.\nIllustrated. 248 pp. New York:\nCrown Publishers. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Russians in Kuriles Face Rougher Life After Quake","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/world/russians-in-kuriles-face-rougher-life-after-quake.html","abstract":"  Ships are sprawled on their sides, with halos of fuel spreading in the shallows.

The original version of the bill required employers of all sizes to restrict smoking to enclosed, specially ventilated rooms, with a limit of one room to each floor of a building. Smoking was to be restricted to separate rooms in pool halls and separate sections of outdoor cafes, and banned in Shea and Yankee Stadiums except in separately ventilated rooms. Nightclubs and bars not attached to public areas in restaurants or hotels were exempted, as were restaurants seating fewer than 50 people. That last exemption was removed, however, after the vast majority of speakers at the Council Health Committee's first public hearing on the bill, in June, clamored for even stronger legislation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/c-corrections-476269.html","abstract":"  A review in The Times Book Review today, about \"In the Lake of the Woods,\" by Tim O'Brien, misstates the command responsibility of First Lieut.

The article seemed, perhaps with intentional irony, to present this with a tone of admiration. I am an official of the community in which the individual in question apparently spends his fun-filled weekends -- reportedly spraying a hose around the living room of his rented house (what a wild and crazy guy!), putting books in one of his housemates, beds (whoa, killer jest!) and generally cavorting with people half his age, vicariously arranging their relationships, while avoiding any of his own.    As a village official, however, I am not as concerned with the desperation inherent in this sad picture.

Not even Harvey Blissberg, the Boston Red Sox outfielder who turned private detective when he got too old to play the game. How old is that? you ask. Well, in Richard Rosen's WORLD OF HURT (Walker, $20.95), a lippy cop describes Harvey's face as \"too old for a baseball card but not old enough for plastic surgery.\" Which makes him nicely seasoned for the job he takes on for his brother, Norm: to find out who killed a real estate agent who played on Norm's pickup basketball team in an affluent Chicago suburb.   The foreign terrain of the Midwest brings out all the best instincts of this smart sleuth, whose quiet intelligence and dry wit have been much missed since his last appearance six years ago in \"Saturday Night Dead.\" Harvey's mental notes on the regional suburban culture are every bit as striking as his keen insights into characters like the desperately bored housewife -- gallantly described as \"a woman of some substance, some intelligence, some irony\" -- with whom he has a brief, debasing sexual encounter. The sights that catch Harvey's eye are homely but unnerving, from the resident \"suicidologist\" installed at a local high school to the meticulously groomed split-level homes in which he glimpses \"people growing older inside their houses.\" A thinking man like that -- no wonder Harvey was always so lonely in the outfield.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Keeping Reserves Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/realestate/your-home-keeping-reserves-sound.html","abstract":"  THE lobby is shabby.

Just be sure you have my tie right.\" The comment is emblematic of Joyce. JOYCE IMAGES (Norton, $39.95), a book of photographs and drawings edited by Greg Vitello, whose previous books include \"Twenty Years of Masterpiece Theater,\" reaffirms the face of the family man who was one incarnation of James Joyce (1882-1941) -- but the heart of the radical artist who saw life so intensely eludes this collection. Despite an excellent essay by Anthony Burgess on Joyce's life and work, completed shortly before Burgess's death in 1993, \"Joyce Images\" oddly reaffirms the limitations of the visual record. Five photographs of Joyce by Josef Breitenbach, published for the first time, take their place beside well-known portraits by Man Ray, Berenice Abbott, Gisele Freund and Augustus John. One wishes for more text. The famous photograph of four generations of Joyces -- James; his son, Giorgio; and his grandson, Stephen, seated beneath Tuohy's portrait of Joyce's own father -- has a deeper significance if we know that Joyce considered a father \"a necessary evil.\" Photographs of Joyce's daughter, Lucia, show an enigmatic, and lovely, young woman. She was ultimately lost to schizophrenia and confinement in mental hospitals, and Joyce believed it was she who had inherited his genius. Her brilliantly rendered drawing of her father is especially poignant because it demonstrates such fine control. The family record is brought more happily up to date with a photograph of the writer's only living descendant, Stephen Joyce. He is pictured with his wife, Solange Raytchine Joyce, who wears the \"Love is unhappy when love is away\" necklace that Joyce had made for Nora Barnacle in 1909. Recent drawings by Robert Motherwell and David Levine attest to the continuing fascination with Joyce. The admiration and reverence of other writers is documented by F. Scott Fitzgerald's whimsical cartoon of Joyce at a dinner party in 1928 and by one of the book's closing photographs, of Ezra Pound's visit to Joyce's grave site in Zurich shortly before Pound's own death in 1972. The homage paid by one great writer to another is a fitting image with which to end a book about a man who is ultimately accessible only through his own words.\nJOELLE ZOIS","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Dr. Daruwalla's Quest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/books/l-dr-daruwalla-s-quest-453170.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I thoroughly enjoyed reading Robert Towers's review of John Irving's latest novel, \"A Son of the Circus\" (Sept. 4).

Nearly identical in height (just under 30 stories) and similarly clad with classically inspired gray stone facades, the buildings propose an image of dignity for Federal architecture. And both end up partly trapped within the image they project.   Watching the stone go up on these buildings over the past few months, I've experienced something like the distraction that has overtaken me more than once while watching televised hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It's hard to pay attention to what the senators are talking about after you start to focus on their haircuts, their lapels, their expressions. Couldn't they devote just one morning session to a discussion of wardrobe and grooming?

I had never paid them much attention before. For reasons of righteousness or repression or both, I had little experience with pornography, so going into the shops (at night, of course), getting stacks of quarters from amiably bored young attendants, closing myself into private viewing booths and surfing through channels of men and women in various combos acting out sexual fantasies was perhaps a bigger deal for me than for most. And that may well have contributed to my post-game, first-draft opinion -- no big deal. Because I had seen no violence and no children in the pictures, I wondered if porn wasn't less of a clear and present danger than football.   In this column's spirit of interactivity (more and more topics are suggested by readers, some of whom stop me on the street), I asked for second opinions. I was surprised by their number and intensity and range. There was much rage expressed at my \"insensitivity to the degradation of women\" in this current backlash rash of strip joints, Calvin Klein ads, and movie mayhem. There was a faint round of applause for my not falling into the \"current panic over porn.\" And a Brooklyn businesswoman, for sophisticated urban reasons, said she would welcome a porn shop in the heart of her neighborhood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Some Surprises Meet Nation of Islam Visitors on Ghana Tour","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/world/some-surprises-meet-nation-of-islam-visitors-on-ghana-tour.html","abstract":"  For the Nation of Islam, holding its first convention outside of the United States, this week has been billed as a return to the motherland.

It is a coloratura showpiece in which Lakme, the daughter of an Indian Brahmin, imitates the tinkling of a magician's bell. The song is also supposed to have magical power, to lure the imperialist English soldier who has violated the holy ground of a Hindu temple and captured Lakme's heart. In her realm, the fluid world of dream holds sway. In his realm, responsibility and duty have their claims. The Bell Song is a musical bridge between the two cultures; even its words speak of connecting disjointed worlds.    Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but many of this season's operatic offerings have similar preoccupations with the meeting of cultures. The City Opera is presenting Borodin's \"Prince Igor,\" a tale of medieval confrontations with barbarian hordes who seem to threaten Russia with either seduction or annihilation.

Of autumn Mr. Palmer says: \"Much more than the other seasons, the wealth of the fall harvest rejuvenates my hunger and propels me to the stove.\" New dishes include starters like green onion and chanterelle risotto with garlic-chive essence and shaved pecorino. Among entrees are roasted guinea fowl with a ragout of morel mushrooms, and seared peppered squab with Zinfandel and Champagne grapes.

(Review: 5/10/91; article: 4/18/93) FELIDIA *** (212) 758-1479; 243 East 58th Street; $$$$; all major credit cards    This elegant two-story restaurant with a rustic flavor offers an extensive menu that focuses on northern Italian cooking with some specialties from Istria, the birthplace of the chef-owner, Lidia Bastianich. \"Fall is the most sensual time of the year in the Italian kitchen,\" she says.  \"The ethereal aroma of the white Alba truffle, the muskiness of the porcini and mellowness of the wild game 'brasati' reaffirm my commitment to the preparation, serving and sharing of the Italian cuisine.\" New selections include porcini and truffle risotto; braised boar in Barolo wine with polenta and braised cabbage, and a whole pheasant roasted and served with a natural sauce. (Review: 11/20/92) JO JO *** (212) 223-5656; 160 East 64th Street; $$; all major credit cards    Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurant has the feeling of a Parisian bistro, with its polished dark wood wainscotting and beveled mirrors. His cooking is based on his brilliant use of fresh vegetable juices and flavored oils for his sauces rather than butter or cream. Fall, he says, is most distinctive for the richness of its smells and tastes, from boar and venison to truffles, wild mushrooms, root vegetables and dried berries. His fall menu includes starters like seared scallops with a tartare of beets and parsley juice, and sauteed sweetbreads with chestnuts and a drizzle of truffle vinaigrette. Among entrees are roasted venison with braised pears and bacon, and broiled squab with pomegranate juice.

Entrees include pan-roasted red snapper with salsifis, spinach and a black truffle sauce; braised veal with Swiss chard au jus, and roasted breast of duck and confit with a sour cherry sauce.

Main courses include lamb shank with natural juices, served with couscous, and veal chop with a vegetable stew redolent of aromatic spices. (Review: 11/5/93) THE SIGN OF THE DOVE *** (212) 861-8080; 110 Third Avenue, at 65th Street; $$$$; all major credit cards    The cooking is as beguiling as the setting at Sign of the Dove with its brick arches, bursts of colorful flowers and soft lighting. David Shack, chef de cuisine, calls fall \"an exciting time\" because, as the weather gets colder, \"people want dishes that are mellow, full-flavored and warming, the kind of food chefs love to prepare.\" Among starters are pumpkin ravioli in a capon broth sprinkled with Parmesan and fresh parsley, and a streudel of wild mushrooms and caramelized onions with a Port-and-sage reduction. For main courses there is baked snapper with garlic crumbs and served with cranberry beans and pancetta, and venison medallions with a parsnip puree, celery root and quince.

The next morning, Brooks Atkinson, the New York Times drama critic, called it \"the most beautifully blended musical show we have seen in this country.\" The first three songs in Act I -- \"Make-Believe,\" \"Ol' Man River\" and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,\" sung in quick, dazzling succession after the overture, knocked theatergoers for a loop. \"Show Boat,\" the smash hit, went on to become a revered institution, the much-analyzed, seminal work that forever changed the American musical theater. That's a heavy load to bear.    Harold Prince faces the task head on in the pristine new production at the Gershwin Theater. The astonishing thing about Mr. Prince's \"Show Boat\" is not its opulence, its cast of 71, its determinedly correct social consciousness or its often striking use of cinematic techniques. The show looks lavish, but looks count for little over the span of a performance that lasts nearly three hours. Rather you'll be stunned and swept effortlessly along by the melodic variety and intensity of the score, which predates the gorgeous Richard Rodgers-Hammerstein \"Carousel\" score by 18 years, and can still upstage it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/playing-in-the-neighborhood-467391.html","abstract":"  MIDTOWN Cross an Ocean But Stay in Town   Every two years, the Ocean Liner Museum -- which has 500 members but no fixed home -- finds the space and puts together an exhibit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Bodega as Bawdy House: Old Law for New Problem","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-bodega-bawdy-house-old-law-for-new-problem.html","abstract":"  For more than two years now, neighbors of the New Way, a bodega on the southeast corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 107th Street, have known that plantains and oranges were not the only things being sold from the wooden shelves in front.   \"It was not like they were trying to hide it at all,\" said one woman, a 50-year-old artist who can see the bodega from her window. \"There were guys out there flaunting huge wads of cash, being really in-your-face about it.\" The woman, like others in the area who had joined forces to try to stop the flourishing drug trade, did not want her name used for fear of retribution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Tina M.

Completed by Marion Mainwaring. Penguin, $10.95. When the author died in 1937, she left this work unfinished. Readers were left wondering what became of Nan St. George, a young American who made an unhappy marriage to a dull English duke and then dared to leave him. Marion Mainwaring's addition of new chapters has resulted in \"a fairy-tale novel, miraculously returned to life,\" Wendy Steiner said here last year.  TRAVELS WITH LIZBETH By Lars Eighner. Fawcett Columbine, $11. For a number of authors, homelessness has been an experiment, an experience to be tried and then written about. For Lars Eighner, it was no literary choice. This chronicle, selected as one of the best books of 1993 by the editors of The New York Times Book Review, describes the three years in the 1980's that Mr. Eighner, jobless and destitute, spent on the road with his dog, a Labrador mix named Lizbeth. Our reviewer, Jonathan Raban, said, \"If there's any justice in the world it should guarantee its author a roof over his head for the rest of his days.\"  TROUBLE By Fay Weldon. Penguin, $10.95. There's plenty of it in the life of Annette Horrocks, a first-time novelist: She's pregnant and her husband, Spicer, has rejected her in favor of New Age psychotherapy and extramarital affairs. For her humorous adventures \"we must praise and thank Ms. Weldon and her wicked pen,\" Tama Janowitz said here last year.  EXIT INTO HISTORY: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe By Eva Hoffman. Penguin, $11.95. The author investigates the cultures of six countries that used to be part of the Communist bloc, including her own homeland, Poland. She concludes that their identities are too often reductively described. Last year our reviewer, Robert D. Kaplan, said, \"Ms. Hoffman's book provokes fresh imaginings about a part of Europe where change is just beginning to unfold.\"  21 SUGAR STREET By Lynn Lauber. Norton, $10. This first novel centers on two characters from the author's collection of short fiction, \"White Girls.\" In 1970 Loretta Dardio, a white teen-ager in love with a black man, Luther Biggs, is forced to give up their baby daughter for adoption. Their story is \"wisely observed and well written,\" Mark Childress said here last year.  THE GOLDEN THIRTEEN: Recollections of the First Black Naval Officers Edited by Paul Stillwell. Berkley, $15. During World War II, the Navy finally allowed black men to become officers. But such progress did little to halt racist behavior. Last year our reviewer, William H. Honan, called these reminiscences -- from the eight survivors of the original 13 black officers and from three white commanders -- \"fascinating and moving.\" Racial prejudice in the military is also explored in ASSAULT AT WEST POINT: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker, by John F. Marszalek (Collier/Macmillan, $12), an account of the experiences of the third black man to enter the academy. Originally titled \"Court Martial,\" the book tells how Whittaker, a former slave, was court-martialed in 1881 for supposedly faking a brutal assault against him. \"It reads like a well-paced courtroom fiction,\" The Book Review said in 1973.  THREE NOVELS: The Deep, Beasts, Engine Summer By John Crowley. Bantam, $12.95. This volume gathers together early science fiction works by a master of the genre. In \"The Deep,\" John Crowley's first novel, warring societies on an Earthlike planet are visited by an emissary on a strange mission. In 1977 our reviewer, Gerald Jonas, said, \"Paraphrase is useless to convey the intensity\" of the prose. \"Beasts\" takes place in an anarchic future in which the United States no longer exists and a new species -- part lion, part man -- plays an important role. The author \"displays a prodigious inventiveness,\" Mr. Jonas said here in 1976. There is still another post-apocalyptic vision in \"Engine Summer.\" In 1979 our reviewer, again Mr. Jonas, praised its \"ingenious, well-made plot.\"  THE CIVIL WAR By Geoffrey C. Ward, with Ric Burns and Ken Burns. Vintage, $13. This edition of the companion volume to the acclaimed 1990 PBS series doesn't have the photographs that appeared in the hardcover, but it faithfully reproduces the text, which includes narratives by politicians, soldiers and slaves. It is \"thoroughly researched\" and \"vividly written,\" David Haward Bain said here. A particularly poignant passage in Civil War history is chronicled in THE LAST FULL MEASURE: The Life and Death of the First Minnesota Volunteers, by Richard Moe (Avon, $15), the story of the 262-man regiment assigned the suicidal task of stopping the huge force of Confederate soldiers who were about to divide the Union Army at Gettysburg. Last year our reviewer, Richard E. Nich olls, called it \"a vigorous, haunting celebration.\" Also reissued is WITHOUT CONSENT OR CONTRACT: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery, by Robert William Fogel (Norton, $14.95), which expands upon the theses of the author's 1974 book, \"Time on the Cross.\" This history acknowledges slavery's horrors while analyzing the sometimes questionable moral practices of its abolitionist opponents. \"Mr. Fogel has the good judgment to moderate the polemical tone\" of his earlier work, C. Vann Woodward said here in 1989.  TONY AND SUSAN By Austin Wright. Warner, $5.99. Susan Morrow's ex-husband has returned to her life: he wants her to comment on his first novel.

Lawyers don't make enough money from these clients to motivate them to do a decent job.    To be able to keep their buildings, small owners need free or affordable legal assistance.

The 78th Precinct is trying to stymie the latter not by arresting the prostitutes, but by aggressively pursuing their customers. The police mark those who gravitate to Third Avenue near DeGraw Street, in the Gowanus section, an area that bustles in the daylight hours with factory life but that draws a less savory form of business once the sun sets.   The precinct is the latest one to begin campaigns in which potential customers are arrested when they approach female police officers posing as prostitutes.   In one police operation, customers' cars are confiscated, in a rare application of a state forfeiture law usually used to seize cars used in drug deals.   The police crackdown began in the Public Morals Division in January 1991, with the hope of curbing spots throughout the city where prostitution was a particular problem. In 1993, the division arrested 581 people for soliciting decoys, and impounded 181 automobiles.   This past summer, the division began training individual precincts to conduct independent stings.   So far, several precincts have started their own programs, and find that they are successful at nabbing customers and vexing them with the car seizures. But it is unclear whether the drive actually slows business.   In Prospect Park, for example, officers go out once a week for a few hours, rotating randomly between simple arrests and the confiscation of cars, and have found that they can barely keep up with the number of customers, said Capt. Richard Rosa of the 78th Precinct.   \"It takes us two hours to pick up 10 cars,\" said Captain Rosa. \"In one night, we had 20 bodies in three hours. We had a medical doctor -- you think he'd know better -- to middle-class to working-class guys,\" he said.   Once the customers are arrested, the captain said he is forced to keep the female decoy officers nearby, or else other potential customers try to pick them up while they are busy with their initial arrest. \"We roll up with lights flashing, sirens going; you think they would get the message,\" said Captain Rosa, whose unit has made 70 arrests and confiscated 32 cars since mid-August.    The officers, usually two or three each time, are scantily clad and are wired, so that when approached, they can tape a conversation, Captain Rosa explained.    The officers never proposition a man, but will ask them what they want. \"As soon as monetary money is mentioned, we just pull up and get them,\" he said.   A suspect is generally booked, then released, but must appear in court the next day, where he is usually issued a summons. The cost of recovering a car can be 20 percent of its value.

End of story.   But is it? No, and the plot line has been unraveling for some time. Now a new book, \"As Seen on TV: The Visual Culture of Everyday Life in the 1950's,\" extends the revision. It is by Karal Ann Marling, an art historian and a professor of American studies at the University of Minnesota. Her account doesn't have much to do with Pollock or de Kooning. But it has a great deal to do with Winston Churchill, Claudette Colbert and a forgotten businessman named Max Klein.   As Marling describes it, in a chapter titled \"Hyphenated Culture,\" the 50's wasn't a decade defined by a small band of Greenwich Village abstractionists struggling to fame despite a hostile public. It was a decade of unprecedented interest in painting. Everyone was at it. Ike was in the White House with the television on, painting copies of greeting cards (up to 7 in 10 days!). Hollywood stars promoted themselves as weekend dabblers. Sinatra painted clowns, Fonda plums, Colbert portraits. A traveling show featured art by celebrities like Joe Louis and Clifton Webb.   Another exhibition that toured the country showcased art by businessmen. One man whose work was in it, a New York City clothing manufacturer, said he had been inspired by Irving Stone's biography of van Gogh, \"Lust for Life,\" a surprise best seller when reissued in 1946. Specifically, he said, his painting \"borrowed from the violent style of that tortured master.\" Van Gogh, that is, not Stone.   The rest of the country, it seemed, was painting by numbers. I don't know about you, but the paint-by-numbers craze always seemed to me -- as it did to 50's social commentators, who heaped scorn on it -- somewhere between Hula-Hoops and Davy Crockett on the scale of cultural signifiers. But maybe not. It doesn't require a relativism that would equate Mighty Morphin Power Rangers with Valkyries to see how serious painting and painting by numbers spoke to the same moment in American cultural life. At the least, Abstract Expressionists rose to postwar stardom partly on the tide of a popular mania for painting -- even if they had to be cast as charlatans to do so.   So great was the public's enthusiasm for painting by numbers that one entrepreneur told Business Week in 1953: \"We pray a little, keep our fingers crossed, and hope that when the herd finally turns to glass blowing, enough will stay behind to keep us in business. In the meantime, we're cleaning up.\"   You may feel edified to learn that a great work like Leonardo's \"Last Supper,\" at $11.50, was the all-time favorite among paint-by-numbers hobbyists. Until you discover that \"Three Kittens,\" produced by Picture Craft, a company headed by Max Klein, was a big hit, too. Klein started a \"Masterpiece\" line that included nudes and celebrity portraits. A Picture Craft ad said: \"Decorate Your Home . . . or Sell Your Paintings for Profit.\" Sure enough, judges at a San Francisco art show were even fooled into awarding one a prize.   \"Do-it-yourselfism,\" writes Marling, \"was the last refuge for the exercise of control and competence in a world run by the bosses and the bureaucrats.\" She points to the influence of Churchill as amateur painter, and particularly to his popular book, published in America in 1948, \"Painting as a Pastime.\" In it he extolled the therapeutic value of putting down \"large fierce strokes.\"   \"Churchill's insistence that art was cheap psychotherapy or a way of releasing pent-up feelings found some resonance in the 'splash and wallop' technique of the Abstract Expressionists,\" observes Marling.   Here you have it. Paint-by-numbers enthusiasts and Abstract Expressionists alike were affected by the same 50's Zeitgeist: the tension between social strictures and personal freedom. When the critic Harold Rosenberg famously described de Kooning and others as Action Painters, he was, on a highfalutin level, echoing the widespread belief that art was a form of release.   Of course, there was only so much releasing that most Americans could take -- hence the preference for painting that nonetheless stayed within the lines prescribed by Klein & Co.   Abstraction was O.K. when it came to those asteroid shapes and squiggly forms on the new Formica kitchen counter tops. But Grandma Moses' treacly pictures were what the average Joe wanted on his walls. Moses, an autodidact, ideally suited a decade of do-it-yourselfers and paint-by-numbers hobbyists.   Moreover, she painted homespun fantasies of a bygone country. If art was a means of escaping the new corporate grind, her paintings epitomized escapism. Little wonder she was dubbed America's most beloved artist or that in 1950 the United States Information Agency, to hype American culture, sent her works to Europe -- where the French and others received them warmly, to the horror of America's art establishment.   We do well to remember that the art stars of the period, besides Moses, included Ben Shahn and John Marin. In exalted circles, praised was lavished on them during the postwar years. In 1950, Marin had a retrospective at the Venice Biennale; in 1954 Shahn had one (as did de Kooning).   The Museum of Modern Art put those Venice shows together. But it wasn't until late 1956 that it presented a one-person show of an Abstract Expressionist in New York -- a posthumous tribute to Pollock. A David Smith retrospective in 1957 and a survey called \"The New American Painting,\" which toured Europe in '58 and came here the next year, were the only other shows exclusively dedicated to Abstract Expressionism that the museum mounted during the entire decade.    The point is that Abstract Expressionists didn't simply take charge during the postwar period. For much of it, they weren't even the main event. And their rise is better understood against the backdrop of Shahn and Marin, of Moses and the paint-by-numbers craze, than in a vacuum.   American art in the 50's turned out to be a tango of High and Low: Pollock, dancing around drip paintings in a studio at the end of Long Island, partnered with Gene Kelly, dancing around in his beret as the artist in \"An American in Paris\" (a 1951 film). The history of postwar American art, far from a closed book, has only started to be written.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Corporate Giants Weigh Moving Headquarters to the County","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/corporate-giants-weigh-moving-headquarters-to-the-county.html","abstract":"WESTCHESTER'S economy, troubled by corporate downsizing and move-outs in the last few years, could get healthy quickly if some major corporations in Manhattan decide to pull up stakes and move to Westchester. \n\nAt least three large New York City-based companies are engaged in separate studies of the Westchester and northern suburban office markets, which could include Fairfield County and sites in New Jersey, to determine whether they will move their headquarters out of Manhattan.

But comments like the alleged Fehr-Goodenow link from management people themselves enhance the comparison.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Faulk Has Already Achieved Escape Velocity With Colts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/sports/football-faulk-has-already-achieved-escape-velocity-with-colts.html","abstract":"  After his spectacular career at San Diego State, Marshall Faulk seemed sure to become a pro football star.

Green misrepresents my views on the legality of Jewish settlements on the West Bank.   He says I am \"virtually alone\" in believing that Israel's legal claim to those territories is stronger than that of any other possible claimant, a view Stephen Schwebel of the International Court of Justice advanced some years ago. Julius Stone, among other experts in the field, also supported this view. The Carter Administration is the only American Administration that ever said the Israeli settlement policy was illegal. In any event, being \"virtually alone\" in a professional opinion is hardly a reproach a scholar should take to heart. His task is different.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"The Cotton Blossom's in the
