It is built of a hundred billion nerve cells sheathed and nourished by a trillion supporting cells. And projecting from every neuron is a delicate communications cable called an axon that splits and branches and splits again, like the crown of a great spreading oak, allowing that one nerve cell to cry out through synaptic conduits to a thousand others of its kind. All told, there are more synaptic connections encased within a single skull than there are stars flung across the universe.    Neuroscientists who study the developing brain have long sought to understand just how that extraordinary neuronal circuitry gets wired up in the first place. They have struggled to identify the signals responsible for axonal guidance -- for steering the tender and tentative axon of a young nerve cell through the pandemonium of the growing brain and over to its appropriate target. Once the tip of the axon has found its correct resting spot, it can begin forming synaptic linkups with as many neurons in the neighborhood as it needs to contact to get its message across. And only with its axons in place can a brain begin to register the world around it: to see, to think, to feel, to know itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940816","headline":"Review/Fashion; Exotic Swimsuits That Shape the Body","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/style/review-fashion-exotic-swimsuits-that-shape-the-body.html","abstract":"  Romancing the swimsuit has helped Gottex build its position as a world power in beach clothes.

The all-female school, which is the subject of Kim Longinotto and Jano Williams's film, \"Dream Girls,\" was founded in 1914 and is near Osaka. Each year it produces a glitzy revue that suggests a demure, ritualized mixture of a Las Vegas floor show, a Ziegfeld-style Broadway extravaganza and a cross-dressed beauty pageant.   \"Dream Girls,\" which opens today at Film Forum, is a 50-minute documentary that pointedly illustrates the ways the Takarazuka school and revue reflect Japanese puritanism and sexual politics. Depending on their vocal registers and physiques, the students are assigned to male or female roles in the school's much-admired productions. In these shows, the girls who impersonate men become the stars.

The trouble stems from a 1992 law to curb abuses on 900-number calls. That law also said 800-number calls shall be toll-free. However, in case toll-free was taken to mean, for example, that a catalogue company could not charge for a shirt sold over its 800 line, the law says it is all right to charge for the business transacted so long as there is an agreement -- for example, where the caller has contracted for a computer information service on an 800 line, or where the caller gives a credit card number to order that shirt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940818","headline":"Haitian Chief Buffs Image On the Streets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/world/haitian-chief-buffs-image-on-the-streets.html","abstract":"  Lieut.

These include, Senator Grassley says, requiring that workers be allowed to retain their health insurance even if they lose their jobs, barring insurers from disqualifying applicants from coverage for pre-existing conditions, and allowing companies to form voluntary cooperatives to buy health insurance for their workers. ROBERT C. SMITH    Republican of New Hampshire. A staunch conservative from a low-tax state, he strongly opposes the Mitchell bill, partly because he says it would impose 17 new taxes. He also contends that the Mitchell bill would throw out the nation's present medical care system and replace it with a vast Federal bureaucracy, that it would create three new entitlement programs, that it would diminish the choice of plans by establishing a standardized benefits package, and would require some employers to pay for their workers' health insurance. MARK O. HATFIELD    Republican of Oregon. Senator Hatfield opposes the Mitchell bill, partly because he says it does not address cost containment. In addition, he contends the Mitchell measure would pre-empt existing Oregon laws, including one that bars punitive damages in malpractice suits, which he says reduces costs by cutting malpractice premiums. He also regards as too low the Mitchell provision that calls for 1.75 percent of insurance premiums to be earmarked for medical research. BILL BRADLEY    Democrat of New Jersey. He supports Senator Mitchell on employer payments, which he says would meet his goal of reaching universal coverage through \"shared responsibility.\" But he opposes Mr. Mitchell's cost-containment provisions, which Senator Bradley says would impose taxes on too many people.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940818","headline":"After 20 Years, South Africa's U.N.

Secondly, impose a pre-existing-condition exclusion so they can say, Well, look, if you have that pre-existing condition, we can exclude you for that existing condition. Limit your lifetime benefits so that your protection runs out when you need it the most. They can cancel it and cancel your coverage when you get sick.   We've had several examples in the very recent weeks of employers for good companies that had their health care canceled for all of their employees because of the incidence of illness among just a few of their employees and just effectively canceled out within a two- or three-month period.   There's also the exclusion of any service from coverage, even a service that might turn out to be most important to you if someone in your family becomes seriously ill.   And no American is guaranteed choice.   And I think these following points are worthwhile to keep in mind:   If your employer doesn't offer a plan you like, you can be out of luck. And 84 percent of employers offer only one plan. Of the employers that make available health insurance to their employees, they provide one plan. Effectively, out of luck if you wanted an alternative choice. You take it or leave it.   Secondly, if your employer doesn't offer a plan that allows you to keep your family doctor, you're also out of luck. . . .   And the Dole plan is better than the status quo alternative, but it's still I don't believe good enough. The insurance companies can still impose pre-existing-condition limitations, they can sell you a policy that doesn't cover the service you may need the most . . . because policies aren't required to provide comprehensive coverage. STATEMENT BY SENATOR SMITH     My office has received thousands of phone calls and letters, more phone calls and letters, I think, than anything since I've been in the Congress, on the issue of health care reform. Both sides.    I hosted a statewide health care conference earlier this year, in April, that featured leading policy experts from every facet of the health care delivery system. There were doctors, and there were providers and nurses and patients and everyone who had in some way had an impact, or were impacted by any change in legislation in the health care industry. . . .    In addition to that, I have 10 counties in my state and I have held a town meeting in each of those counties. . . . We were there to directly hear from constituents regarding the issue of health care reform. And they spoke out. There were hundreds of them, in all of those town meetings, more than any ever attended any of my citizen forums on any issue. . . .   In short, I guess the fairest thing to say is I've heard New Hampshire speak to me, with me, on this issue. And overwhelmingly what they're saying is that they don't want the Government any more involved in health care than it is already involved now. In other words, less Government involvement.   I think there's a concern, unfortunately, that comes through as I listen to these constituents and providers, and all of those who are in any way affected by this pending legislation. There's a concern that the Government is going to do something to me on this issue.   I think that's coming through loud and clear, and it's a very valid concern: Rather than helping us, they're going to do something to me that may cost me my good quality health care.   And the polls, the national polls, which have changed dramatically from overwhelming support to what President Clinton had proposed to the opposite now, . . . show that Americans share the same feelings as those people in New Hampshire. So I don't think there's a great difference between the states, no matter what state you represent on this issue.    I believe that based on what I have heard, people that I've talked with, that most Americans would oppose not only the underlying finance bill, which is technically on the floor, but also the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt, or Clinton-Mitchell bill, as we have here. Fifty-three percent, according to the polls, worry that Congress will pass a plan that gives the Federal Government too much control. And that's a very valid concern. They're suspicious because Government has proven again and again that it's not efficient, it's not compassionate, it's not thrifty and therefore shouldn't be trying to provide for the health care needs of people, least of all health care.    If a mistake is made by a Government official in, perhaps, the administration of the I.R.S., or some other program -- post office, perhaps, late delivering the mail -- it's a problem, maybe, but it's a minor problem compared to some slip-up in the treatment of your health. STATEMENT BY SENATOR HATFIELD     What we're trying to do in Oregon is to provide everybody with standard, primary health care. We're not going to separate every Siamese twin born in Oregon; we're not going to guarantee, in essence, that everybody has the right to any medical procedure -- over 9,000 of them under Medicare alone. We have prioritized them.   People say, Oh, that's rationing health care. Well, we're rationing health care, yes, but we're doing that today under an economic face which is certainly discriminatory, far more discriminatory than saying to a person 80 years old, If you have a life expectancy added to your life by one year, are we going to engage in a very costly medical procedure as against covering 100 women with prenatal care? No. We can't afford to do it.   Now that gets down to where the real rubber hits the road in terms of having to make the tough decisions that somehow we're going to offer anyone any medical procedure or access to any medical procedure. That's the implication, because we've not addressed those thousands of medical procedures and we . . . have the attitude that any one of them -- and it's very, very clear -- any one of them would be open for anyone.   What Oregon has done is it focuses on the provision of preventive health care services and assesses an access to primary health care before serious health problems develop. Now, it looks at the effectiveness of treatment, it draws lines, as I say, to exclude payment of services that are not effective nor add to the individual's quality of life.   I think we have to face this reality in the national picture as well. STATEMENT BY SENATOR MITCHELL     I hope the American people will not be fooled by the rhetoric they're hearing here today. And I hope the American people will also think about the irony of these Republican senators getting up here day after day after day and denouncing Government health insurance and Government health care as bad for their constituents even as they benefit from it themselves as individuals and their families.    Every member of this Senate participates in the Government-run health insurance system that's available to all Federal employees. And the Government pays 72 percent of the cost of that health insurance for these Republican senators who are standing here telling their constituents that it's bad for the constituents even as they participate in it for themselves and their families.   You American taxpayers are paying through the Government, 72 percent of the cost of health insurance in a Government-organized health insurance system for the very Republican senators who are now telling you that you shouldn't want Government-run health insurance.    And you are entitled to ask yourselves if it is so bad for you, why is it so good for them and their families.   Has one of them stood up and said, \"My constituents, Government health insurance is bad for you, and to prove how much I believe that statement, I'm going to voluntarily drop out of the Government insurance system. And I'm going to put my family in the same place where your family is.\"   Have you heard one say that yet? No. And you're not likely to.    Now that's just the insurance. Now let's talk about direct care.   If one of these Republican senators doesn't feel well, if he gets a headache, or his stomach aches, he walks a few feet down the Capitol and he goes to the office of the Capitol physician, a Government employee. He is greeted by a clerk who is a Government employee, checked by a nurse who is a Government employee and then goes in to see the doctor, who is a Government employee.    If Government health care is so bad, why do these Republican senators insist on having it for themselves? And then if they get sick, if the doctor says, You've got to go to the hospital, they go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital, or the Walter Reed Army Hospital, Government hospitals. Well, my gosh, ask yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. America, If these Government facilities are so bad, why do these Republican senators want to go there themselves?   And it's not just senators. President Reagan and President Bush were in their capacities as President the most powerful men in the world. And they were independently wealthy, and they could have gone anywhere in the world when they got sick.   And where did they go? Why they went to these Government hospitals. And who can forget the photographs taken of them waving out the window to the public and the press in those Government hospitals?    Why, are you telling us that it's good enough for Presidents, but it's not good enough for ordinary Americans? STATEMENT BY SENATOR BRADLEY     The Senate's effort to reform the American system of health care has important consequences for all Americans. It will determine the availability and the extent of health care for each of us. It will determine in part how long our parents will live and how healthy our children will be.   As we debate this issue, let's remember what brought us here in the first place. We are not debating this issue by chance. There's a reason why we all speak of this effort as health care reform. In dozens of living rooms and conference halls, in emergency rooms of hospitals and on street corners, the message that I hear from the people of New Jersey is that we need reform.   Our current system is not working as it should; those who have health coverage are paying too much for it, and those without health coverage deserve it. . . .   What people want most is some control of escalating health care costs. What people fear the most is losing their health care if they change jobs or get laid off or lose a job because of a corporate bankruptcy.   What perplexes them as well, when they're confronted with all these escalating costs of health care, is the power of the insurance industry. Want coverage for your heart problem? The insurance company says no because it's a pre-existing condition. In other words, the insurance company will insure you for everything but the heart condition that is most likely to generate the health costs for your family.   In confronting skyrocketing health care costs, small business is left to the mercy of insurance companies. Small businesses have no leverage to negotiate with insurance companies. Too often they're presented with a take-it or leave-it choice that only offers exorbitant costs for health care coverage.   Each of us can enumerate countless occasions in our states when we've had interactions with small-business people who've simply said they can't afford to cover the workers in their particular small business, they can't afford to cover because they were told by the insurance company that it's $6,000 or $7,000 a person and they have no leverage to negotiate with the insurance company.   If you get open-heart surgery, the tab is $49,000. A Caesarean section birth, $7,500.   Remarkably, women of higher incomes have more Caesarean section births. I don't think that's related to a differential in the size of the birth canal; it's related to the ability to afford to pay.   And a visit to an orthopedist, $300 for the first visit, $175 for each visit after that.   Most people have become accustomed to good health care, even with these costs. The health care simply costs too much, more than it should cost.    When President Clinton proposed health care reform last year, none of us thought he was imagining the problem. There was consensus that we should act, we should do something. The political noise of the last 12 months aside, health care reform is as needed today as it was then. The families who need it are still here, in New Jersey and all of our states. The families that don't have the health care need it as much today as they did a year ago. All those of us who were paying health costs today are paying too much today, just as we were paying too much a year ago. . . .   It is the job of Government to protect the public health and welfare in the short and long term of its citizens.   How to do this in the area of health care is the essence of what this debate is all about. Our fundamental goal should be to enable a competitive health care marketplace to keep people healthy but take care of them when it does not.   By and large, America's health care system is an excellent system, but it does have a few glaring faults. We should block or undermine those elements that work in our current system. We should fix those areas that don't work, and in so doing, improve the overall system.   Recent trends suggest the health care markets are becoming more competitive and efficient. We can spur that process by insuring that insurance companies compete on price and quality, not on their ability to omit high-risk patients. Managed competition is beginning to bring better health care at lower prices to many Americans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940818","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/us/inside-986461.html","abstract":"  Victim's Kin Get Children   Two children whose Jordanian father fled with them to Jordan after killing their mother left Amman to return to New Jersey in the custody of their mother's relatives.

But here in the most extremely southern reaches of Southern California, with up to six productions running simultaneously in the two major regional theaters -- three at the La Jolla Playhouse on the campus of the University of California at San Diego, and three more 20 minutes down Interstate 5 in San Diego proper, at the Old Globe Theater -- it's a lush season, and the air is as redolent of greasepaint as it is of the sea.    In the last couple of seasons, regional theaters in general, and those on the West Coast in particular, have become the most fertile developmental ground for new work in the American theater. To wit: three of the four Tony nominees for best play last season -- \"The Kentucky Cycle,\" \"Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992\" and the winner, Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America: Perestroika\" -- spent developmental time at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. And though few new nonmusicals are expected to land on Broadway in the 1994-95 season, two that are -- Neil Simon's \"London Suite\" and Arthur Laurents's \"Jolson Sings Again\" -- will first have their world premieres at the Seattle Repertory Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940818","headline":"No Upsets as Tournament Turns Down the Volume","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/sports/tennis-no-upsets-as-tournament-turns-down-the-volume.html","abstract":"  Drowned out by controversy on Tuesday night, when Andre Agassi blamed his opening-round exit on piped-in music that distracted him during change-overs, today the beleaguered Volvo International took a meteorological drenching that halted play midway through the afternoon.

Most of those 2,500 troops are protecting a security zone in southwestern Rwanda where more than 600,000 people, mostly Hutu, have fled, fearing reprisal killings by a new Tutsi-dominated Government. Observers fear that when the French leave, so will the unprotected Hutu, making a second human wave across the border into Zaire, where some 800,000 refugees already languish in disease-ridden, makeshift camps.    But unlike the last Rwandan exodus, this one can be foreseen. An obvious preventive step would be to persuade France to stay until a planned U.N. peacekeeping force, made up of troops from African nations, can be assembled -- a matter of weeks, not months. Objections to a longer French stay, however, arise not in Paris, though there is a clamor to bring the troops home, but among suspicious leaders of the new regime in Kigali. Its agreement is essential, but its distrust is understandable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940818","headline":"Pataki Attacked Over Arrangements for His Father's Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/nyregion/pataki-attacked-over-arrangements-for-his-father-s-care.html","abstract":"  In a three-way explosion of campaign bitterness, the candidates for governor lashed out at each other today over reports that the father of George E.

But it is now clear that the chairman of that panel, Judge David Sentelle, violated the court's own standard for purity of appearances by meeting with a Senator eager to have the court dump Mr. Fiske as counsel. For that reason, the appointment of Mr. Starr is fatally tainted.   This situation was brought about by Judge Sentelle's flamboyantly bad judgment in meeting with Senator Lauch Faircloth and another Clinton opponent, Senator Jesse Helms. At the time, Judge Sentelle and his two colleagues on the court were considering the appointment of a new prosecutor. Mr. Starr is in no way to blame for this untoward meeting, but he has to recognize that a cloud of political favoritism now hangs over his appointment and will undermine public confidence in it. As a matter of public service and personal honor, he should resign the appointment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940818","headline":"Freed Man Is Planning to Leave The Town Where Trouble Began","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/nyregion/freed-man-is-planning-to-leave-the-town-where-trouble-began.html","abstract":"  Eric Jackson-Knight, more than a dozen years of jail time under his belt, walked out of a Brooklyn courthouse last night a free man and said that, more than anything, he wanted to leave New York -- his home and the place where all the trouble began.

In the concert hall, audiences do not carve meat or drive a car but instead concentrate exclusively on the music, for the most part. There is a sort of attention surplus, which conductors like Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Trevor Pinnock have tried to balance out with sharp-edged, revved-up interpretations. Tafelmusik, which has been recording prolifically of late for Sony Classical, favors a more laid-back, elegant sound, not manically precise: Jeanne Lamon leads from the first-violin chair.
