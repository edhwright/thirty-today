For a penny, customers can shoot him with blanks as he sits in a rocking chair in a simulated theater box. Between visitors, the Lesser Known, as he calls himself, is garrulous. He talks of his wife, Lucy, back East, a confidante to the dying who hears their last words, and of his young son, Brazil, whom he expects will be a professional mourner one day. Tinny vaudeville tunes trickle in, as a bust of Lincoln -- a hole in its head for the pennies -- is illuminated by a white, ghostly light.

It's a modest work: a remodeled entrance and lobby in an old garment district loft building, along with a redesigned hallway on one of the upper floors. It is also modest in spirit. Mr. Ranalli, an architect known for spare geometric designs, has departed from his customary vocabulary and steeped himself in the style of an earlier day. He hasn't renounced his own esthetic. Rather, he's woven it into a vintage swatch of urban fabric. Synthetic blends may not be fashion's raiment of choice, but Mr. Ranalli's stylistic synthesis is a beauty.   Located at 575 Seventh Avenue (at 38th Street), the Fashion Center Building is hardly a traffic-stopping landmark. But the 24-story block of showrooms and offices is a rich part of the garment district's distinctive urban tissue. And while the building's architect, Henry Ives Cobb, is an obscure figure today, he was highly regarded at the turn of the century, chiefly on account of his master plan for the University of Chicago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"The Doctor Who Gave Silk Stockings a Second Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/arts/arts-artifacts-the-doctor-who-gave-silk-stockings-a-second-life.html","abstract":"  \"SAVE YOUR OLD SILK stockings,\" Sir Wilfrid Thomason Grenfell wrote in a 1928 issue of the Grenfell magazine, a quarterly that publicized his medical mission in what were then the British colonies of Newfoundland and Labrador.

Even though WYNY-FM (103.5) is one of the biggest country stations in America, it is pretty much the only game in town, and its playlist is limited to a narrow range of new-fangled contemporary stars.    For a hard-core country fix, listeners should turn to Laura Cantrell's \"Radio Thrift Shop\" on WFMU from 1 P.M. to 3 P.M. on Saturdays. Ms. Cantrell moves deep into the heart of honky-tonk, western swing, barn waltzes and rodeo songs. She concentrates on the classic period from the 40's to the 60's, when kings and queens like Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Bob Wills and George Jones ruled the Grand Ole Opry and continuously redefined the style for a changing rural America.    Like the best disk jockeys, Ms. Cantrell is part historian, part fan, part philosopher. While she has an active weakness for big names like Williams and Jones, she also has the breadth of knowledge to unearth plenty of forgotten gems. She is at her most revealing when she emphasizes the women of country: sassy mamas like Kitty Wells and Tammy Wynette, hot rockers like Wanda Jackson, unsung heroes like Molly O'Day and Dale Evans. Country music is a stereotypical bastion of conservatism, but Ms. Cantrell shows that these women were feisty long before feistiness was fashionable.    \"The Radio Thrift Shop\" presents country music as a living oral tradition. Ms. Cantrell is happy to throw in the occasional tidbit of juicy gossip: \"Hubert Davis was a drunk old banjo player around Nashville for a long, long time,\" she said after playing his ineffable ode to illicit romance, \"I Know You're Married but I Love You Still.\" And her taste extends beyond country into folk, blues, gospel and swing. When she juxtaposes a big band tune like Lee Wiley's \"I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues\" with Bob Wills's \"San Antonio Rose,\" she not only provides appropriate context, but brings unseen connections to light. At its best, country music can be as mean as the blues, as raucous as rock-and-roll, as romantic as the sweetest pop standard. Ms. Cantrell knows this, and she wants to share it. KAREN SCHOEMER SOUNDS OF YESTERDAY    In the wee hours of the morning, when WQEW, \"the home of American popular standards,\" ventures a little too far into Barry Manilow and Billy Joel territory, turn your AM dial a few notches to the left to WEVD (1050) and \"The Danny Stiles Nostalgia Extravaganza.\" Seven nights a week, from about 11 P.M. to 5:30 A.M., WEVD stands for \"wonderful, entertaining vintage disks,\" as Mr. Stiles digs up some of the coolest, strangest, funniest and most obscure recordings of the pre-rock era. He also broadcasts on Saturdays from 2 P.M. to 5 P.M. on WNYC-AM (820).   Mr. Stiles -- who refers to himself variously as the \"vicar of vintage,\" \"the raja of rare records\" and \"the doctor of archeological discology\" -- has a fascination for the forgotten: his area of expertise spans more than 100,000 albums, singles, 78's and old-time radio broadcasts from the late teens through the 50's.    Mr. Stiles, who has been a D.J. for 47 years, owns several different versions of Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher,\" and he remembers when Frank Sinatra was known as \"The Voice\" and \"Swoonatra.\" He holds names like Connee Boswell near to his heart, and reveres Al Jolson as the king he once was. Sometimes, just for a kick, Mr. Stiles will throw in an old country tune like Ray Price's \"Crazy Arms,\" because his program has no boundaries, playlists or limitations; his only guideline is his own idiosyncratic passion for a moment in pop history that is little more than a shadow.   Mr. Stiles's show harkens back to a time when radio was the mouthpiece for a national subconscious. He reads his own commercials for restaurants, pastry shops and plumbing supply stores, and he broadcasts from a make-believe art-deco studio on lower Broadway. Coming through the hazy AM band in the middle of the night, the needle of his turntable scratching through the grooves of ancient vinyl artifacts, he really does seem like the ghost of a lost but grander time.    There is a song that plays at the end of the film \"The Shining,\" a wierd, otherworldly tune called \"Midnight\" by the Ray Noble Orchestra. Like Jack Nicholson's character in the film, Mr. Stiles sees himself in the past. When he plays \"Midnight, the Stars and You\" on his radio show, he brings something long dead back to life. K.

Those musical documentaries include Balinese trance rituals, Pygmy yodels, Haitian voodoo rites, throat singing from Tuva, just north of Mongolia, in the former Soviet Union, Japanese sitting songs, American Indian squaw dances and Australian aboriginal music.\n\nIn the 18 months since he founded Ellipsis, Mr. Charno's efforts have won popular and critical acclaim.  \"Global Meditation,\" a four-CD collection of spiritual, ritual and meditative music from 40 countries and traditions, won the Billboard World Music Album award for 1993. \n\nLast year Mr. Charno worked with the United Nations when it declared 1993 its Year of Indigenous People.  He produced \"Voices of Forgotten Worlds,\" transporting listeners to 28 cultures, from a Mayan fiesta to a Tibetan monastery. A recording of contemporary African music has just been released, \"Africa: Never Stand Still,\" and a three-CD set, \"Trance,\" will appear in the spring.\nSecret of Success\n\n How does a native from Queens who has a degree in psychology and who calls himself a \"bad musician\" find himself marketing the music of far-flung lands? Combine Mr. Charno's fascination with with distant cultures, his business acumen and a holistic orientation, and a partial answer emerges. \n\nMr. Charno began as a distributor of health products and quickly expanded to include \"new age\" music. In 1985 he produced his first music series, \"The Art of Relaxation.\" The Relaxation Company, which he founded with his wife, Jenny, a massage therapist, focuses exclusively on products that enhance relaxation. \n\nMr. Charno became so intrigued by the music that he compiled a sampling of what sounded best. That was the start of Ellipsis, a venture separate from the Relaxation Company, he said. Sales from both concerns exceed a total of $2.5 million a year.  \"Ellipsis is an open-ended company, an indulgence,\" he explained. It is is named for the points denoting missing words. Each set of music is accompanied by booklets or books introducing little-known cultures.\n\nIn a 95-page companion book to \"Forgotten Worlds,\" the editor, Larry Blumenfeld, captures the appeal of world music by describing a concert by Tuvan throat singers in New York. \"With stringed instruments and hand percussion,\" he wrote, \"the ensemble establishes a simple rhythm reminiscent of the folk music of many areas. When the singing begins, two, three, four sounds emanate simultaneously from an individual singer, ranging from deep growls to high flutelike tones.\n\n\"In combination with one another, the singers create an almost otherworldly effect. The audience, mostly curious Americans, sits in rapt attention wearing looks of wonder. The Tuvans on stage grin.\"\n\n\"There's a growing hunger that people feel to find out who we share the planet with,\" Mr. Charno said. \"We're a restaurant to help people sample a meal.\" His kitchen, the office on Lumber Road, welcomes visitors with tinkling wind chimes, offers of herbal teas and a liberal sprinkling of Mr. Charno's laid-back humor. The conference room is dominated by a pool table used for relaxation, although it is covered for formal meetings. A conga drum rests in one corner. \n\n\"That's how Jeff calls us to meetings,\" Mr. Blumenfeld smiled.\n\nA large blackboard on the floor is fresh with marketing ideas, and the warehouse downstairs holds a gym that is convenient for Mr. Charno, the father of 6-month-old Emma.\n\nMr. Charno is proud of his cross-market appeal, which includes book and record stores and nature companies. \"Bookstores don't sell 'Pearl Jam,' but they sell 'Voices of Forgotten Worlds,' \" he said. \n\nMr. Charno has honed in on projects with a mixture of musical and political soul. The United Nations classifies 300 million people in 70 countries as indigenous, direct descendants of the original inhabitants of their land, and often oppressed by colonizers. \n\n\"The voices of indigenous people are beginning to be heard,\" Mr. Blumenfeld said. \"Politically they demand rights and representation. Environmentally they defend what they hold most dear, the land they've inherited. Culturally they teach us ways to farm, to heal and to look at life. The voices heard through this project are powerful. They say simply, 'Our land sounds like this.' \"\n\nAlthough Mr. Charno is sympathetic to the plights of indigenous people and donates a percentage of his sales to the United Nations Center for Human Rights, he insists that the music comes first. \"I'm not on the indigenous-people's rights bandwagon,\" he said. \"I resist the temptation to become preachy about it.\"\n\nYet Mr. Charno could not totally escape political implications. The United Nations halted further involvement because of \"a couple of cans of worms,\" he said, adding:\n\n\"The Chinese Government doesn't consider Tibetans to be an oppressed indigenous group. The Tibetans see their country as an occupied land.\" \n\nAn aboriginal people in Taiwan, the Bunun, posed a similar problem. After World War II many Chinese moved into their tribal areas.\n\n\"We wanted to respect political and social issues, but not be completely guided by them,\" Mr. Charno said.\n\nThrough photographs often obtained through The National Geographic, Mr. Charno said, he hoped to dispel misconceptions and infuse \"Voices of Forgotten Worlds\" with authenticity and reality. \"We tried to identify when people were in costume and when it was Tuesday afternoon at the market,\" he said. \"A photo of Tibetan monks shows them wearing vests and sneakers along with red robes and funky hats.\"\n\nMr. Blumenfeld interviewed 75 musicians around the globe by telephone.  He said he was moved by the stories of people like Nakamoto Matsuko, an Ainu woman who lives in Japan. \n\n\"My grandmother has an Ainu name,\" he quoted her in the book.  \"My mother and I don't. We can't have Ainu names, because the Government wants all the people to be Japanese. Assimilation policy means that we cannot speak Ainu.\"\n\nMr. Blumenfeld said it was \"an eye-opener to talk to people my age who weren't able to speak their mother's language in school.\"\n\n\"People are aware of dying species, plants, even cultures,\" he said.  \"But not much thought is given to languages that are disappearing by force. To me music is a language.\"\n\nThe American Indian musicians he interviewed were initially \"standoffish, defensive and suspicious of my motives, because they felt their tradition and music had been co-opted by the men's movement,\" Mr. Blumenfeld said. \nLove in a Rain Forest\n\n Mr. Blumenfeld was intrigued by stories like that of Louis Sarno, a New Jerseyan who fell in love with a Pygmy woman in a rain forest in the Central African Republic. \n\n\"Their music, which features exquisite polyphony, subtle calls and responses and distinct harmonies, is a reflection of the egalitarian nature of their society,\" Mr. Sarno told Mr. Blumenfeld. \"Everyone has a part, but alone it's nothing. When they come together they make this beautiful whole. The collaboration they have in their society is not forced. They cooperate out of their own heart.\"\n\n\"The idea of a community getting together to make music in a spontaneous way is deep,\" Mr. Charno said. \"I don't have that in my life.\"\n\n\"Music is simply a part of life for indigenous people,\" Mr. Blumenfeld added. \"It's not like hiring a band for a wedding. It's something you can't separate from the rest of life.\" In \"Forgotten People\" he describes as follows the simple musical traditions of the 100,000 Inuit people, inhabitants of the Arctic formerly known as Eskimos: \n\n\"High atop a hill overlooking a partially frozen sea, an elderly Inuit man beats a small, simple round drum with a wooden stick. He begins to sing a melodic chant over the beat as he turns his body left, and then right. Bending at the knees, he springs up again and again, moving the drum side to side, completely absorbed in the drum song.\"\n\nMr. Charno, too, is completely absorbed in his projects. Like a juggler balancing a half-dozen balls, he oversees the musical, marketing, legal, editorial, administrative and engineering aspects of his company. \n\nHe also knows when to delegate. His producer, Brooke Wentz, works on contacting record labels and archives to locate music that has already been recorded and listens to hundreds of hours to whittle down the choices. For Mr. Charno's newest project, a boxed set of flamenco music to be released in the fall, he has hired a Spanish expert. \n\nSome of the issues Mr. Charno has faced may seem simple, but he researches each one thoroughly. For instance, although all his projects are printed on recycled paper, he is ambivalent about its value. \n\n\"There's a lot of fluff about recycled paper, because it's not 100 percent recycled,\" he said. \"A lot of distinctions are not obvious to the consumer. It's a very sensitive issue, because customers want to know that companies are acting responsibly. Until we finish our own exploration I would rather err in the direction of safety, both environmentally and commercially. It's interesting and cool that companies can use environmental issues to further their commercial practices.\n\nFor Ellipsis projects other than \"Forgotten Worlds,\" Mr. Charno donates a percentage of sales to the Rainforest Alliance. So far that totals $15,000. He anticipates donating another $15,000 to the United Nations. \n\n\"Each person has his own joik, his own special song,\" says the Saami tradition of Scandinavia. Mr. Charno sings his joik through Ellipsis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Summer Glories Passed Quickly, But Oh, the Fall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/arts/classical-music-summer-glories-passed-quickly-but-oh-the-fall.html","abstract":"  TO HEAR HER IS TO LOVE her: if anyone feels otherwise about Victoria de los Angeles, I don't want to know.

At the end of the 1940's, the operatic world -- discovering in two or three seasons a decade's worth of great singers queued up during the war years -- responded rapidly to this generous voice of cream and port, and Miss de los Angeles had debuts in rapid succession at the Metropolitan, Covent Garden, La Scala, Rome, Vienna. Even then she had the confidence to insist that she first be presented in recital in each city; this guaranteed a friendly core audience in the opera house, because the recitals were at such a level of expertise, novelty, spontaneous communication and indefinable stylistic savoir-faire that the singer could initiate a houseful of devoted admirers at each one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Missing: One Dog.

On a showery April day, English bluebells glow with vibrant color: the blue of a sky washed clean, bright water in a quiet bay, a nest of robins' eggs, the implicit promise of iris and forget-me-nots. After a dark, cold winter, wild bluebells -- actually, wild hyacinths, officially identified either as Endymion nonscriptus, Scilla nutans or Hyacinthoidies nonscriptus -- suddenly appear in astonishing profusion for their brief blooming season, somewhere from late March to early May. Certain woodlands, where bluebells thrive in mottled shade, often look as if their spring housekeepers had flung out new bright blue carpets.   Although many visitors to England seek out the drifts of daffodils made famous by Wordsworth, few know exactly where or how to look for bluebells (the American bluebell, Mertensia virginica, is from a completely different family). Daffodils grow easily from bulbs planted almost anywhere. Bluebells are shyer and more elusive, true wildflowers clustering in damp areas along woodland paths. Those who want to find bluebells in their full glory must venture beyond London. Although a bluebell takes seven years to flower from seed, some woods are so thick with plants they become known in season as bluebell woods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Health Care for All, if Congress Doesn't Weaken","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/opinion/l-health-care-for-all-if-congress-doesn-t-weaken-389110.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Organized labor backs real health care reform.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Move Intended to Quiet Questions on Clinton's Land Deal Seems to Backfire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/us/move-intended-to-quiet-questions-on-clinton-s-land-deal-seems-to-backfire.html","abstract":"  There were many in the White House, including President Clinton, who hoped that the appointment in January of Robert B.

Small wonder, then, as Liza Crihfield Dalby points out in KIMONO: Fashioning Culture (Yale University, $30), that modern Japanese women, who may wear their national costume only a few times a year, can be turned into fashion victims by traditional dress that is \"woven of meanings as much as it is of fiber.\" Ms. Dalby, an anthropologist whose 1983 book, \"Geisha,\" described her year as an apprentice in a Kyoto geisha house, acquired her initial learning the hard way -- by attempting to master the skills of \"professional kimono wearers.\" That sort of devotion may well be required to stick with some of the essays in her new book, which covers \"such diverse topics as political hierarchy, the esthetics of color, the sociology of gender and the logic of formal systems\" as it traces the history of an \"elegantly anachronistic\" garment that continues to maintain a firm grip on \"the Japanese heart, mind and purse.\" Less diligent readers will be content with a parade of intriguing drawings, woodcuts and photographs, and a number of chapters -- particularly those on the shift from native costume to Western clothing (\"The Kimono Discovers Itself\") and the kimono in modern Japan (\"Women Who Cross Their Legs\") -- that demonstrate, in illuminating detail, Ms. Dalby's belief that while innocents may wear their hearts on their sleeves, we all reveal something of our personality there.

All but a handful of coal mines are now closed, factories are automated, a welfare state is in place and the labor movement, having come full circle, is again weak. In fact, when the movie was released in France last fall, the cries of \"Germinal!

The first answer is guitars: loud, aggressive, pitiless guitars, shamelessly recycling 1970's heavy metal via tastes honed by punk rock. The ascendance of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Nirvana confirmed that the Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath fan clubs have never adjourned. Since the end of the 60's, the sound of suburban teen-agers coming of age has been the sound of grinding, stomping guitars and howling voices, holding the promise that turbulence can be converted to triumph.    Yet Seattle rock also twisted its 70's roots. Black Sabbath had sung about Satanism and apocalypse; Led Zepplin wailed mystical ruminations and testosterone blues. Seattle bands broke the link between power chords and extroversion; they turned inward and brooded, exploring endless variations on self-laceration and hopelessness. Songs were about the smoldering rage that goes with powerlessness, about the downward spiral of drug addiction, about cynicism so deep it couldn't even imagine humor. In the teen-age (and twentysomething) wasteland of the 90's, when neither jobs nor purpose are within easy grasp, guitar riffs weren't all that carried the music up the charts; the pervasive despair also hit home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"A Prisoner Perseveres And Wins Freedom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/a-prisoner-perseveres-and-wins-freedom.html","abstract":"  Vincent James Landano was driving to his mother's house on Staten Island one day in 1976 when he passed several police cars leaving her street.

Its pedigree of old Yankee radicalism and tradition is impeccable. Founded by Roger Williams, that freethinking rabble-rouser who was kicked out of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Providence claims not only the China merchant and slave-trader John Brown, who initiated the burning of the British ship Gaspee in Providence Harbor in 1772, but also his brother Moses, one of the country's first great industrialists and abolitionists. (Brown University was named for the family.)\n\nBut there is more to Providence than Yankee bloodlines and old buildings. Today it's a young, funky and hip city, with an emphasis on the arts. Providence is smallish (population about 170,000), but because of its colleges and universities -- including Brown University, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence College, Rhode Island College and Johnson and Wales University -- the quality of the visual, performing, literary and culinary arts is as high as that of much larger cities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: Bedford - Stuyvesant; Officials Say Health Center Is on Verge Of Insolvency","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-bedford-stuyvesant-officials-say-health-center-verge.html","abstract":"  Ten years of financial problems at Bedford-Stuyvesant's largest mental health center have forced the center to the brink of insolvency, according to city and state mental health officials.

His name is now added to a growing groundswell of Long Island taxpayers who are coming to grips with this problem. In November of last year Tom Gulotta defeated Ben Zwirn in the contest for Nassau County Executive. The central issue in their bruising campaign was the onerous burden of taxes that the electorate now bears. Both candidates pledged to at least stop raising them. But Islandwide only 40 percent of the property taxes paid by this electorate goes to support governmental services. Sixty percent goes to fund the public schools on Long Island. Yet this huge 60 percent school-tax bill generates only a small fraction of attention from our state legislators and media that the 40 percent generates for governmental services. This must change.   In Rockville Centre, 78 percent of our $37 million budget goes toward school-district employees' salaries and fringes. The salary range of teachers goes from a starting salary of $35,000 a year to a high of $83,000 a year, and those figures do not include fringes or overtime. The average salary for all R.V.C. teachers is $59,419. But if you want a classic example of what 40 years of lobbying our school boards and state legislators by the teachers union, has accomplished it is the fact that in R.V.C. there are 363 salary classifications used to pay the 259 teachers in our system. Isn't that bizarre? Most of the other school districts have similar pay scales.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/books/in-short-fiction-367176.html","abstract":"  SHORT STORIES  THE DECLINE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD  By Robert Wexelblatt.

In recent years, most classical stations have followed a destructive philosophy of programming innocuous background music for a projected upper-class listenership.

Longer symphonic works are increasingly rare, vocal or chamber music nearly nonexistent; the 20th century slips in only by accident. The possibilities of the medium -- to explore wider repertory, to propagate new music, and to draw highlights from the limitless archives of recordings -- go largely unrealized.   With three classical stations, New York was once a haven for radio listeners. WNYC-FM, the public radio station, offered some remarkably adventurous new-music programming in the early 1980's, anchored by Tim Page's popular \"New, Old and Unexpected.\" WQXR-FM (96.3) and, to a lesser extent, WNCN still allowed music of substance into their commercial formats.

Britten's last opera is, after all, about a man who falls in love with a boy. It is about surreptitious passion for physical beauty, and it is about disease and death.   So in pictures and sound, \"Death in Venice\" is art imitating life, though not necessarily the life Thomas Mann saw when he wrote his novella in 1913 or Britten when he made his operatic treatment in 1973. The story of the opera comes as no surprise in 1994, but for Mann's readers, and even Britten's much later listeners, homosexual passion did not pop up in books and operas every day.

In those unusually Minimalist works, the clouds of rich moody color that had characterized Rothko's mature work had been blasted away. All that remained were barren moonscapes: in work after work, single rectangles of gray met rectangles of black to form a bleak horizon.   Instead of exhaling, and suffusing the eye with soft color, these paintings inhaled, and held their breath. The rectangles almost seemed locked in a vise, thanks to the clean, hard lines of their edges, which, in contrast to Rothko's usual feathered borders, showed signs of taping. An emotional scale that had ranged from brooding to exultant to lyrical was collapsed into a single note of despair. The last Rothkos at Marlborough hinted at an artist who had reached a dead end.

The McCarter Theater in Princeton will be presenting each, if only for a single performance.   In the midst of what appears to be an Edith Wharton renaissance, Ms. Worth, who last year celebrated the 50th anniversary of her stage debut, is offering a reading -- her word is recital -- from the author's novels, including \"Ethan Frome\" and the 1933 autobiography, \"A Backward Glance.\"   Ms. Worth's \"Portrait of Edith Wharton,\" which she has described as \"an old-fashioned Victorian evening,\" is on tap tomorrow night at 8. It includes observations on New York's frivolous society, conversations with Henry James, memories of a first prepubescent kiss and sexual fulfillment at 45, but mostly, it is about the joy of writing.   Today from 5 to 7 P.M., Ms. Worth is also to discuss, with Arif Mardin, a composer, their new recording, \"Her Infinite Variety -- Irene Worth as the Women of Shakespeare,\" with a question and answer period afterward. The appearance, which is free, will be at the Betts Auditorium at Princeton University's School of Architecture at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Washington Road.   Audiences will have to wait until June 9 to hear Mr. Gray, in \"Gray's Anatomy,\" tell of his quest for a risk-free cure for an eye ailment: a \"macular pucker.\" Among the alternative medical practitioners he visited, he says, are a witch doctor in Borneo, a Filipino psychic surgeon and a quack in New Jersey.

Legree in buying Tom saw him as a possible overseer. Legree is driven mad with exasperation and comes to hate Tom more and more, because Tom, far from being hardened by all the blows he has to endure, befriends first a fellow slave in the field who is not up to the punishing work and then Legree's quadroon ex-mistress, Cassy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/sports/transactions-386200.html","abstract":"  Hockey National Hockey League","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Play Area Lost in Bureaucracy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-play-area-lost-in-bureaucracy.html","abstract":"  Once again, spring is on its way, and once again, 550 grade-school students at P.S. 75 on West End Avenue and 96th Street will be using an empty paved lot for a playground.

In the advertising world, romance rarely flourishes between the creative and business sides. \"In creative, they call the account people 'suits,' \" Ms. Rudberg said. \"My boss at the time banned account people from coming onto the creative floor. Once, as a practical joke, somebody outlined a dead body in chalk on the floor and wrote, 'Account guy.' \"    Mr. Thibodeau, 28, is now working on commercials for Brute cologne at Lintas. Like an actor getting into character, he always wears Brute. Ms. Rudberg, 31, now works at the Lotas Minard Patton McIver agency, where she's known for wearing hats made of everything from fake leopard skin to fake green grass and for being the pickiest perfectionist in the office.    Judy Lotas, a partner in the agency, recently saw the movie \"Blink\" with the bride. \"The other people in the theater were screaming because it was sort of scary, but the only time Linda shrieked was when the female lead's lipstick had disappeared and she just had her naked lip liner on,\" Ms. Lotas said. \"Linda gets esthetically horrified.\"    The couple, who compared planning their wedding with working on a commercial together, spent a year organizing the event, which turned out to be stylishly homemade and personal, down to the tiniest detail.   For instance, a shower for the bride at her Upper West Side apartment was actually a poetry reading. She asked about 20 friends, all women, to bring poems, instead of kitchen utensils or lingerie, and read them aloud.    For the wedding invitations, the couple bought handmade paper that looked like granite -- blue with white and gray specks -- from an art supply store in the East Village; they had them printed by hand at SoHo Service. Even the vases for the wedding had the bride's colorful, quirky imprint on them. Ms. Rudberg, a potter, had made dozens of vases -- pink polka-dotted, striped and otherwise Dr. Seuss-inspired, each filled with a one-of-a-kind floral arrangement.   For the wedding, the couple scouted locations on the East Coast and eventually chose the Canfield Casino, an ornate, turn-of-the-century building in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Now city-owned, the casino has a carved oak bar, a gentleman's gambling room and a ballroom with a barrel ceiling decorated with stained-glass medallions the size of manhole covers.    At an interfaith ceremony on Feb. 19 -- she is Jewish, and he is Protestant -- the couple looked their account-creative parts. Mr. Thibodeau wore a dark conservative suit, while the bride appeared in an enormous tulle hat and a white cotton dress as simple as a monk's cassock. Guests compared the hat to everything from a cumulus cloud to a souffle to a geyser of Saratoga Springs sparkling water.    Dinner was served in the ballroom, where the ceiling medallions depict the 12 signs of the zodiac. Even they held a personal meaning for the bride and bridegroom: she is a Capricorn, and he is a Virgo, two very compatible signs.    As the bride recalled: \"After we met, my mother didn't ask, 'Is he Jewish?' She asked, 'What sign is he?' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/us/inside-381772.html","abstract":"  The Second Bomb Case   Having won convictions in the World Trade Center bombing, prosecutors turn to the coming trial of a blind cleric and others charged with a widespread terror plot.

Verdi's passing sent the nation of Italy into shock. The final illness of Gustav Mahler preoccupied European newspapers during the spring of 1911; daily bulletins reported his decline. Even Alban Berg, fully a member of the 20th-century world that paid composers little heed, made news with his untimely death in 1935. \"You can see to what extent the public sympathizes,\" Arnold Schoenberg wrote proudly to Berg's wife Helene, \"from the fact that a radio program broadcast all over America brought a dramatized scene from his life, in which he himself, the conductor Richard Lert and I were cast as characters.\"   The giants of our day -- and yes, there are still giants -- have been slipping away with rather less elaborate fanfare. The death of the Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski on Feb. 7, at the age of 81, inspired no radio dramatizations that I was aware of. Although classical music did make an anomalous cameo appearance on the national media stage that week, the occasion was a diva-driven ruckus at the Metropolitan Opera that held little intrinsic musical significance.

One advantage of being in Tokyo is that regional specialties from all parts of Japan can be savored there, including Kyoto's fabulous lacquer-boxed banquets known as kyobento. So you can decide the rivalry for yourself.   Although by American standards restaurants in Japan are expensive -- sometimes breathtakingly so -- prices are considerably lower at lunch; the four restaurants that follow are suggested for lunch. There is generally no tipping in Japan, but a tax of from 3 to 6 percent will be added to your final bill. Remember, too, that credit cards are not accepted in many restaurants in Japan, except in hotel restaurants. All prices are per person and calculated at 110 yen to the dollar.  Konomi    A small restaurant nestled into the bustling Asakusa district near Kappabashi, Konomi offers exceptionally tasty kyobento that, at lunchtime, are remarkably reasonable in price. The top-of-the-line option between noon and 3 P.M. is the Kyobento Course, which for about $40 begins with an elegant arrangement of hors d'oeuvres and goes on to include a savory steamed custard, delicately herbed rice, miso soup and silky, jade-colored tea sorbet. The main attraction, however, is the kyobento itself. This stunning two-tiered, black and gold lacquered box is a treasure chest filled with nearly two dozen tasty, seasonally appropriate, tidbits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Special Today: The Sophisticated Traveler","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/today-s-sections-special-today-the-sophisticated-traveler.html","abstract":"  Magazine Part 2","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Shaping a West Side 'Urban Entertainment Center'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/realestate/perspectives-shaping-a-west-side-urban-entertainment-center.html","abstract":"  IN a city where large-scale commercial development has all but come to a halt, the node of growth under way in the West 60's is remarkable enough merely for the fact that it is happening.

This revelation, if it holds up, will come as a shock to the vast majority of Americans who no doubt assumed that whatever nicotine is found in cigarettes is simply the residue of the nicotine that occurs naturally in tobacco.

There was nothing in the average person's experience to compare to this spacious, beckoning, empty thoroughfare. It climbed up and out of the city like something seen in dreams. It was a highway people just naturally wanted to travel, even if they had no interest in the smaller, more sedate city they knew to be at the other end. To the New Yorker who lived within its shadow, it was not just a bridge to Brooklyn -- few New Yorkers had any special desire to go to Brooklyn -- it was a highway into the open air. When the day came when everyone could go out on it, when people by the tens of thousands could go up that road and through those colossal arches, they would go, they knew, not to Brooklyn, but to a place where sailing ships would glide like toys beneath their feet, where they could look down on the tallest buildings and their own mean, narrow streets and the people in them, where they could gaze out over land and water and everything man-made. \"What a relief it will be from the ill-smelling streets and stuffy shops,\" one man wrote. \"What a happy escape from those dreadful cabins on the ferryboats!\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"What the Frogs Are Telling Us","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/opinion/what-the-frogs-are-telling-us.html","abstract":"  A familiar harbinger of spring in much of North America is a tiny frog known to scientists as Hyla crucifer and to ordinary householders as the spring peeper. Beginning in March, male peepers in search of mates form a clamorous and joyful chorus, trilling around ponds and swimming pools. But the chorus has muted in recent years, in line with a mysterious worldwide decline in frogs, toads and other amphibians. Now there is evidence that what is silencing the peeper may be ultraviolet radiation resulting from a thinner ozone layer.    This hypothesis does not explain all disappearances: loss of habitat, pollution, acid rain are among other credible culprits. But scientists at Oregon State University have found that ultraviolet rays do deadly damage to the eggs of frogs and toads that have been vanishing from the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. This has to be of some interest to another bare-skinned species.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Mexico City's Chapultepec Zoo Coming Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/travel/travel-advisory-mexico-city-s-chapultepec-zoo-coming-back.html","abstract":"  The Chapultepec Park Zoo in Mexico City, is scheduled to reopen in May after nearly two years of renovations.

The cramped steel cages and cement floors of the old zoo have been replaced, mostly by landscaped areas designed to approximate the animals' native habitat. One section of the zoo is modeled after the lush jungles of the southern state of Chiapas; another is designed to match the dry, rugged plateaus of northern Mexico.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"A Ministry at a Mall Rededicates Itself to Spreading the Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/a-ministry-at-a-mall-rededicates-itself-to-spreading-the-word.html","abstract":"TUCKED between a travel agency and a department store in a bustling southern New Jersey shopping mall is an unassuming little storefront guaranteed to cause a double take among unsuspecting passers-by.

No wide-open spaces here, no jazz or pop or comic-book high jinks. This was sheer nostalgia for the old country, a clever scrambling of 18th- and 19th-century Europe in which Saint-Saens had a way of dropping suddenly into Mozartean cadences and vice versa. Unfailingly pleasant and well performed by two Metropolitan Opera principal players, Michael Ouzounian and Jerry Grossman, the Fantasia is unashamedly and cheerfully designed to please. Salzburg and the Vienna Philharmonic commissioned the music in 1985, and it manages to serve conservatism without losing its sense of humor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"Rabbi Agrees to Guilty Plea in Boy's Kidnapping","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/nyregion/rabbi-agrees-to-guilty-plea-in-boy-s-kidnapping.html","abstract":"  A rabbi pleaded guilty yesterday in the Brooklyn kidnapping of a 15-year-old boy who has been at the center of a bitter dispute between his family and the rabbi, who sought to convert him to his ultra-Orthodox brand of Judaism.   But with a complex custody battle swirling around him, the fate of the boy, Shai Fhima, remained as uncertain yesterday as it was two years ago when he first disappeared. And even the facts surrounding his disappearance remained murky, as Shai and the rabbi, Shlomo Helbrans, continued to insist that Rabbi Helbrans had done nothing wrong, despite the guilty plea. Deal With District Attorney    Rabbi Helbrans offered the plea of guilty to a charge of conspiracy to kidnap in the fourth degree in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The plea was part of an intricate arrangement with the Brooklyn District Attorney that will give the rabbi a sentence of five years' probation and 250 hours of community service. But under the terms of the agreement, the rabbi and another man, Mordechai Weisz, who will also receive five years' probation for the kidnapping conspiracy, did not admit that they had committed any of the specific acts with which they were charged.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"By Design; From the Far East","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/style/by-design-from-the-far-east.html","abstract":"  The newest jackets and shirts for spring (it will get here eventually, honest) are inspired by traditional costumes of the Far East.

Modern Macedonia was, for most of this century, part Greek, part Yugoslav. During the Greek civil war of the late 1940's, Yugoslavia allied itself with the losing Communist side, and at one point Marshal Tito tried to assert his authority over all of Macedonia.

Only Bernstein could have said such a thing to the orchestra that Mahler himself conducted for a decade.

While Bernstein did not \"rediscover\" Mahler by any stretch of the imagination -- to say so would defame the memory of conductors like Walter, Klemperer, Barbirolli and Horenstein -- he almost single-handedly brought the composer to the center of the international repertory.   In the absence of important new compositions or of any educational projects on the order of the \"Omnibus\" programs and \"Young People's Concerts,\" Bernstein's deepening relationship with the music of Gustav Mahler was the great story of his final years.

Darius Johnson buried a wide-open 3-pointer with 31.3 seconds left and Milton Williams, in the lineup because starting point guard Tracy Bergan had fouled out, came up with a crucial rebound, two clutch free throws and an in-bounds steal in the last eight seconds, as Loyola of Maryland captured the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference final tonight with a stunning 80-75 victory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"For a Number of Israelis, It's 'Next Year in Hebron'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/world/for-a-number-of-israelis-it-s-next-year-in-hebron.html","abstract":"  A day after nearly half of Israel's Cabinet ministers said they wanted all Jews out of Hebron, an Orthodox Jewish couple came to town to apartment hunt today.

Ames was announced, the Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, met with several hundred C.I.A. employees in the agency's auditorium at Langley, Va. After recounting what employees already knew from the news media, Mr. Woolsey -- whose address was seen on closed-circuit television by every C.I.A. employee -- spent five minutes explaining why he himself had refused to take a polygraph test, as other recent directors had done. Besides the fact that political appointees are not required to take such tests, Mr. Woolsey said he remained \"skeptical\" about the polygraph's effectiveness.   The speech sickened many officers, according to one who watched. They point out privately that they, too, have questions about the efficacy of the polygraph but are required to take the test every five years or lose their jobs. That the Director would not take it, then would have the effrontery to defend his decision even after thedisclosure of the biggest security breach in the agency's history, tells a lot about the indifference that allowed the Ames case to happen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"Falcons' Miller Reportedly Jumps to Rams","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/sports/sports-people-football-falcons-miller-reportedly-jumps-to-rams.html","abstract":"  Quarterback CHRIS MILLER , an unrestricted free agent, agreed to a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Rams yesterday, ending his seven-year stint with the Atlanta Falcons, The Atlanta Journal reported.

While civilized citizens of the 18th century pursued reasonable deliberation and tried to subdue the chaos of the world, a kind of shadow government of the spirit emerged, burning with the need for irrationality, disorder, even violence. Goethe's Faust and Werther seethed. Haydn's middle symphonies dipped into weird key signatures and trembling passions. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, perhaps the unsung godfather of the Sturm und Drang movement, wrote music of sudden humors and unpredictable phrase lengths.   The melodrama, the merger of music and dramatic reading, was a natural product of this brief revolt three quarters of the way through the 1700's. Even Mozart, in his early G-minor Symphony, had a teen-age fling at storm and stress. The Brooklyn Philharmonic included most of these elements in its programs on Friday and Saturday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, also dredging up a C-minor Symphony by Joseph Martin Kraus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940308","headline":"Americans Reducing Fat in Diet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/science/americans-reducing-fat-in-diet.html","abstract":"  SLOWLY but surely, Americans are getting the fat out of their diets.
