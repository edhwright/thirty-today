Their letters shot back and forth with such apparent rapidity as to put a fax to shame. This was a time when letters were a way of life and of friendship.   Breaking the seal on the envelopes, Mr. Whitemore has his characters meet in mid-missive, a bit difficult when dealing with the cloistered world of Dame Laurentia, the Abbess of Stanbrook. Talking to her, the men sometimes look as if they are in a confessional. Another problem is the simple fact of the threesome. Most epistolary plays have had only two people onstage, which leads to focus as well as give-and-take. With \"The Best of Friends,\" letters and excerpts from other writings are broken up into a semblance of conversation. For all of its pretense, this is less a play than an elaborate platform reading.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"From a St. Patrick's Parade Loyalist, Support for Gay Marchers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/nyregion/metro-matters-from-a-st-patrick-s-parade-loyalist-support-for-gay-marchers.html","abstract":"  WHETHER a parade memorializing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. can be ordered to include marchers from the Ku Klux Klan is just so much contrived supposition, Paul O'Dwyer suggested the other day.   \"I can't conceive of the Klan wanting to march side by side with American blacks,\" the former City Council President said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/nyregion/chronicle-892693.html","abstract":"  She is about to turn 94 years old, and she has not taken pictures since 1959, but tonight ILSE BING will receive the first Gold Medal for photography to be awarded by the National Arts Club at a dinner and reception in her honor.

The Abbey, the official national theater, is also providing some heat with a flickering controversy about its artistic director, Garry Hynes.

They slashed her 1991 production of \"The Plough and the Stars,\" largely because she had audaciously presented Sean O'Casey's gloomy characters with shaven heads, recalling Sinead O'Connor, to the dismay of many Dubliners who detest that singer. Since then, she has been under attack for putting on the wrong plays, for putting them on with imported actors (like Brian Dennehy, who filled the house with his portrayal of Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's \"Iceman Cometh\") and for ignoring the players of the Abbey's own permanent company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"U.N.

Olhovsky, ranked 87th in the world, upset No. 5-seeded Nicklas Kulti of Sweden, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, to take the singles crown in 1 hour 50 minutes. In doubles, the 26-year-old from Moscow teamed with David Adams of Australia to down the Czech Republic's Martin Damm and Daniel Vacek, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. (AP) AUTO RACING That Roar Is Allison Davey Allison finally got into high gear after a disappointing start to the 1993 Nascar Winston Cup season, overpowering the field yesterday en route to a record-setting victory in the Pontiac Excitement 400 in Richmond. Allison, who previously won at Richmond International Raceway in September 1988, the first race on the current three-quarter mile oval, came from 14th place to dominate the second half of the 400-lap, 300-mile event. His average speed of 107.709 miles an hour broke the track record of 105.397 set in February 1991 by Dale Earnhardt. Allison's Ford Thunderbird led three times for 155 laps, including the final 42 laps, and crossed the finish line 4.38 seconds ahead of the Pontiac Grand Prix of runner-up Rusty Wallace. It was the 19th career victory for the 32-year-old, second-generation stock car star.

Yet trade theorists, consumers and exporters often see farmers as a powerful, entrenched special-interest group. They are blamed for artificially raising food prices at home and for obstructing trade. For decades, trade negotiators did their best to avoid agricultural issues whenever they could.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"GAY SAILOR TELLS OF A 'LIVING HELL'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/us/gay-sailor-tells-of-a-living-hell.html","abstract":"  A shipmate of the gay sailor who was beaten to death last October said today that some of the homosexuals assigned to the U.S.S.

The closing wasn't greeted with much public commentary or hordes of television cameras. Salsa Meets Jazz no longer had a fancy profile; after so many years, it had become low key. Pairing the finest salsa orchestras with the finest jazz musicians, it let them find common ground. The common ground often shook, and the shows worked, week after week. Like all things that are consistent, Salsa Meets Jazz had been taken for granted.   It shouldn't have been, and the program's death, from rising costs and a dwindling audience, makes the city just a little more musically impoverished. Under the guidance of Symphony Sid Torin, a disk jockey, and Jack Hooke, a music-business entrepreneur, the series began as a straight Latin music show and then evolved into something special. Over the years -- it took a decade off, between 1970 and 1980 -- it had provided an extraordinary meeting of cultures and some of the best music the city could offer. All the great Latin bands came through, from Oscar D'Leon, the James Brown of Latin music, to Eddie Palmieri, the music's crazy, brilliant uncle; Mario Bauza, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo and Mongo Santamaria all showed up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"Review/Dance; Pittsburgh Ballet's New Direction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/arts/review-dance-pittsburgh-ballet-s-new-direction.html","abstract":"  As one of George Balanchine's most popular ballerinas in the New York City Ballet from 1950 to the mid-1960's, Patricia Wilde could have been expected to direct any other ballet troupe along strictly Balanchinian lines.

A1 CLINTON, NIXON AND YELTSIN   As political odd couples go, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon surely rank with the oddest. But there they were, the Vietnam dove and the Vietnam hawk, sitting around the White House living room bound together by their shared support of of increased aid to Russia.  A1 ZAIRE'S BATTLING LEADERS   The President and the Prime Minister of Zaire both say they have the authority to rule the large, impoverished African nation. Their battle for control has paralyzed the Government and cast doubt about its future stability.  A3 EVACUATION OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS   The Bosnian Serbs' military commander agreed to allow a limited evacuation of Muslims from isolated areas of eastern Bosnia, United Nations and Serbian officials said.  A6 VIOLENCE AGAINST SERBS   Some of the Serbs who remained in Gorazde after Serbian \"ethnic cleansing\" got under way in eastern Bosnia have been put to death as suspected snipers.  A6 News analysis: The obstacles to finding peace in Bosnia.  A7 DEBATE OVER MIDEAST AID MONEY   The Clinton Administration was forced by an influential Democrat in Congress to confront the delicate subject of whether the United States can afford to pour billions of dollars into Israel and Egypt.  A9 ISRAELI SETTLER SLAIN IN GAZA   Palestinian laborers stabbed an Israeli to death in a Jewish settlement, hours after the army opened the Gaza Strip after six days, the Israeli military said.  A9 IRISH LEADER TO MEET CLINTON   When Prime Minister Albert Reynolds meets Mr. Clinton on St. Patrick's Day, he plans to discuss the President's ideas for a U.S. policy on Northern Ireland.

A1 STOCKS REACH A NEW PEAK   Stocks soared to new highs as investors braved the market's risks in search of returns no longer available from bank accounts and bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.84 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 3,469.42.  A1 LESSONS FROM POLICE-KILLERS   Two F.B.I. agents interviewed 50 killers of police officers in an effort to discover what the victims could have done differently. The result is a chilling collection of murderous narratives that could change officers' behavior.

A12 HOLY WAR FOR CULT?   Law-enforcement officials brought in the Army's heaviest tanks and the leader of the Texas cult involved in a bloody shootout and subsequent siege said he might welcome an apocalyptic fire fight rather than a gentle surrender.  A12 LABOR PACT UPHELD   In a victory for organized labor, the Supreme Court validated a union-only labor agreement in the cleanup of Boston Harbor, ruling that states were free to negotiate such pacts.

A13 RENO'S RECORD IS DEBATED    President Clinton praised Janet Reno, his choice for Attorney General, as a \"front-line crime fighter.\" But her office has lagged behind other Florida prosecutors in several measures, including the rate at which they take cases to trial, win guilty verdicts and obtain prison sentences.

But because of the vacancies at the Justice Department, Clinton's counsel, Bernard Nussbaum, is in the unusual position of making some of the department's most important decisions.  A14 THINKING OF CUTS   Clinton and Congressional budget writers agreed to make deeper cuts in Federal programs than the President had originally sought. It was a grudging bow to political as well as fiscal imperatives.  A15 The Administration defended U.S. policy on Haitian refugees.

Said, University Professor at Columbia and a frequent spokesman for Palestinian causes, advances in his latest book is that these novels (as well as the fiction of Conrad and Kipling) not only reflected the imperial ambitions of 19th- and early 20th-century Europe, but also helped to buttress, ratify and validate those concerns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Aids Kit for Powerbook","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/science/personal-computers-aids-kit-for-powerbook.html","abstract":"  APPLE COMPUTER INC. is selling Powerbook portable Macintosh computers at a rate of more than a million a year, which is a remarkable pace for a computer that is mostly incompatible with 90 percent of the other PC's in the world.

Abbott, who was born without a right hand, faced Chris Nabholz from the left side in the top of the third inning using a bat borrowed from Dave Silvestri. After taking a called strike on a fastball, he fouled off two pitches, took a ball and then waved at a curve for strike three. Abbott, who almost hit one out in batting practice, turned into Jay Leno after the game.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Leetch Plays 'Bully' Role In Effort to Rejoin Lineup","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/sports/hockey-leetch-plays-bully-role-in-effort-to-rejoin-lineup.html","abstract":"  Brian Leetch put in a complete practice with his Rangers teammates today at Rye Playland and he even attempted to do a little pushing and shoving with the weak left arm that has plagued him since mid-December.

His amazing skills have wiped the sweat from the most prodigiously difficult endeavors, allowing listeners a calm, measured look at music usually bound up in the struggles of the performer.   Schubert, himself a pianist of uneven accomplishment, was a dealer in dreams and a communicator of personal loss. The compelling nature of nostalgia is the intense pleasure of its pains, and so the dotted rhythm that announces his G-major Sonata (D. 894) is a cry of loneliness sent out across an unbridgeable divide and at the same time an expression of self-sufficient serenity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Dehere Is Top Player","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/sports/sports-people-college-basketball-dehere-is-top-player.html","abstract":"  TERRY DEHERE of Seton Hall yesterday was selected as the Big East Conference's player of the year.

There is the chance to continue the positive steps the Eagles have shown in a 9-9 Big East season, the most Boston College conference victories in a decade.

There is little more painful or less inspiring of song than watching as someone you love is cut off from life by illness. But the curious thing about \"Wings,\" an 80-minute musical adaptation of Arthur Kopit's 1978 play, is how faintly it evokes the devastating emotions of the experience. I arrived at the New York Shakespeare Festival, where this production has been imported from the Goodman Theater in Chicago, with a pocketful of Kleenex. It was at once a relief and a disappointment to discover that its occasional and ineffectual stabs at sentimentality notwithstanding, \"Wings\" is more concerned with the mind than the heart.    Indeed, that is literally the case: like the Kopit play, to which it is largely faithful, this quasi opera is obsessed with the collapse of brain functions that is known as aphasia. In the opening scene, the elderly heroine, Emily (Linda Stephens), an aviator who long ago was an air-show wing walker, has her stroke, and the audience is immediately transported into a mind in which memories are obliterated, language is garbled, logic is short-circuited. Some of that voyage is accomplished visually, by shattered images projected on sliding screens, and some of it by the evocative Sensurround-style sonic effects created by Richard Woodbury. Most impressive, however, is Jeffrey Lunden's score, which uses the scrambling of a consciousness as a cue for musical experimentation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"BASEBALL: METS Notebook; Injury List for Mets In Midseason Form","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/sports/baseball-mets-notebook-injury-list-for-mets-in-midseason-form.html","abstract":"  There is no surgery scheduled, and so for the Mets there should perhaps be no cause for panic.

Simon & Schuster. $27.50.   In his classic study, \"An American Dilemma,\" published 49 years ago, Gunnar Myrdal wrote that the problems confronting disadvantaged blacks in a dominant white society put a spoke through the wheels of democracy. Yet the Swedish economist recognized that despite slavery and adversity, blacks helped to hold the country's social fabric together. In his chapter on black family life in the rural South, he said that blacks had built up their own kind of close-knit family organizations that were conducive to social health.   Now in \"Climbing Jacob's Ladder,\" Andrew Billingsley, a respected black sociologist, builds on Myrdal's work and offers his own surprisingly optimistic study about the inner strength and stability of black families. Professor Billingsley, chairman of the family studies department at the University of Maryland and visiting scholar in residence at Spelman College in Atlanta, finds that like white strivers on the lower rungs of society, blacks also want to gain entry into the American middle class. The new book, a sequel to his \"Black Families in White America,\" published in 1968, continues his argument that black families are born survivors and contain the seeds of their own rejuvenation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"In Europe, Musicals Get Varying Reactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/theater/in-europe-musicals-get-varying-reactions.html","abstract":"  Cole Porter may have epitomized dapper American sophistication between the world wars, but his image had a Gallic aura. Porter loved Paris; he wrote a song to say so, and after 1919 he could even claim to be a three-year veteran of the French Foreign Legion (serving, it should be noted, not in some Godforsaken North African hellhole but in Paris and Fontainebleau).   From 1919 to the mid-20's he lived in Paris, studying counterpoint and composition at the Schola Cantorum and becoming known in elegant circles for his soirees in Venice and on the Riviera as well as in the French capital. His affection for France lasted at least as late as 1956, with his contributions to the film \"High Society.\".","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930310","headline":"17 Arrested in Separate Credit Card Schemes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/nyregion/17-arrested-in-separate-credit-card-schemes.html","abstract":"  Two Queens men were arrested on Monday in what the authorities said was a $2 million-a-year operation that traded in stolen and fake credit cards, and, in a separate case, 15 others were charged with using fake or stolen credit cards, the authorities said yesterday.   The arrests were part of a yearlong investigation by law-enforcement officials that uncovered a network that involved the manufacture, sale and use of fake and stolen credit cards, the Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown, said yesterday. He said the 15 people who were arrested for using stolen or fake credit cards were not linked to the operation of the two men from Queens.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New
