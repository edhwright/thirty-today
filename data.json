D'Amato's plans to spend nearly $400,000 in campaign funds on behalf of George E. Pataki, a Republican gubernatorial candidate.   The decision could have a significant impact on Mr. Pataki's campaign spending in his primary campaign against Richard M. Rosenbaum. He must win the primary election on Sept. 13 to take on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. And the ruling gave the Cuomo and Rosenbaum campaigns a new chance to highlight Mr. D'Amato's support for Mr. Pataki, a relationship that they have used to question Mr. Pataki's independence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940819","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/arts/art-in-review-004464.html","abstract":"  'Photography in Germany, 1913-1935'   Howard Schickler Fine Art  52 East 76th Street  Manhattan  Through next Friday    The exuberantly experimental approach to photography championed during the 1920's by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy was countered by the work of other artists in Germany who used photography with a minimum of manipulation to describe the world in scrupulously accurate detail.

It can't be an easy course to teach these days, with the market still becalmed, but the group exhibition that caps these \"Artist in the Marketplace\" sessions is a reward in itself, and this year's installment is a good one.   As might be expected in a show with 35 participants, eclecticism reigns and quality is uneven. The show gets off to a nice start with Mindy Belloff's installation of dozens of tiny paintings, displayed on shelves or wall racks. Images of flowers and faux Chinese landscapes crop up, although much of the painting is a kind of minuscule version of gestural abstraction. Predominantly black-and-white, the installation has a mournful air, made literal when Ms. Belloff writes on one painting, \"I still get overwhelmed when I think about her\" and the single word \"endure\" on another.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940819","headline":"For Hitchcock, It's a Pennant Race in AAA","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/sports/baseball-for-hitchcock-it-s-a-pennant-race-in-aaa.html","abstract":"  Sterling Hitchcock, the major league pitcher moonlighting in a minor league uniform with the strike persisting, was not flawless while wearing that uniform tonight.

The White House, staring at the prospect of a crippled Presidency, will compromise or threaten, depending on what it takes to get the votes to move the bill.   Given the generally craven environment, it is refreshing to see Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York taking over the unoccupied high ground of a smarter, loftier bipartisan politics. Stating that his obligations as Mayor outweigh party loyalty, he has been campaigning for the Clinton crime bill.

And it's true that from a distance on a humid morning, this 28-year-old pool, set amid the greenness of the park, seems unreal. Thankfully, it is very real, having recently reopened after a $2.8 million renovation.   The water sparkles and seems extra clean, probably because the pool has a new, more efficient filtration system; chlorination, formerly done manually, is now performed automatically, Vijay Gupta, the renovation project's chief mechanical engineer, explained. Unsightly concrete walls and gutters have been replaced with sleek stainless steel, and access ramps, showers and water fountains for the disabled have been added. The tulip and cascade fountains, which hadn't worked in about five years, now gush like geysers, making splashy kiddie pools.   But what most children care about is feeling carefree. Travis Lee, a 9-year-old who lives nearby, said it's a great pool because it's not too deep and he feels safe. (And the lifeguards are easy to spot in their neon-orange outfits.)   There are lockers (take your own lock), a snack bar and stadiumlike seating. Hours: 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily through Sept. 5.

Ferry Ride   NY Waterway  World Financial Center  West Street (between Vesey and Liberty Streets)  Lower Manhattan  (800) 53-FERRY  Monday through Friday    A lot of ferries zip across the Hudson River from Manhattan and New Jersey docks, but only one takes you from the World Financial Center to the Colgate clock at Exchange Place in Jersey City. Indeed, the ride from Manhattan, where you can see the oversize clock across the water, drops you off almost under the timepiece. It's a brief (five minutes) but glorious voyage from state to state, brisk enough to leave your hair looking like meringue if you sit on the ferry's open deck.   The clock sits on a large structure that looks like scaffolding, next to a sign that reads \"Colgate\" in red letters. Up close, looking at the large minute and hour hands, which are black with red in the middle, you understand what it must have felt like to be a Lilliputian.   When we arrived on a recent visit, the clock read 3:27 P.M.; we watched the minute hand move, ever so slowly, to 3:28 P.M. There are rungs around the clock face so that the repairman can make his way around (a tiny shed, way up high in back of the clock, might be, we figured, where that person lives.) We then walked through the adjacent parking lot to Exchange Place and a pier called the J. Owen Grundy Park. One man was fishing and had caught one, which he said he would feed to his cat. By the time we were back at the clock, it read 4:09 and a young visitor said, \"We've been through a lot of minutes.\"   The Colgate-World Financial Center ferry runs only on weekdays and leaves about every 15 minutes from Manhattan, starting at 6:52 A.M. and continuing until 9:45 P.M. Children 6 and under ride free; the round-trip fare for adults is $4. On Saturdays and Sundays, ferries depart from the World Financial Center for Hoboken or Liberty State Park in New Jersey. 'Brooklyn Dodgers'   Brooklyn Historical Society  128 Pierrepont Street (at Clinton Street)  Brooklyn Heights  (718) 624-0890  Recommended ages: 5 and up    At least one 6-year-old boy in the baseball universe continues to look at the newspaper every day as if the major league games were still churning along. He also talks about how Paul O'Neill (a Yankee) and Rico Brogna (of the Mets) are faring, as if they were still playing. So in the continuing effort to stave off reality, we visited this show devoted to the long-ago Brooklyn Dodgers, who left in 1957 for Los Angeles.   Here's what the young fan considered important: a 10-cent comic-book cover depicting Jackie Robinson, as well as a picture of him as he signed on as a Dodger in 1947; a Pee Wee Reese baseball card; a base from Ebbets Field; the mitt Mickey Owen used in the fourth game of the 1941 World Series; a newspaper photograph of Ebbets Field being demolished by a wrecker's ball and assorted Dodger uniforms, bats and gloves.   This is but a small part of a permanent exhibition on Brooklyn neighborhoods and history, yet it could be significant for someone suffering the baseball-strike blues. (For a few guffaws, you should also seek out the funny mirror, circa 1920, in the Coney Island section.) The society is open Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $2.50 for adults and $1 for children; free for all on Wednesdays. Summergarden   The Museum of Modern Art  The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden  14 West 54th Street  Manhattan  (212) 708-9491  Recommended for all ages  Through Aug. 27    Not even the warning of thunderstorms could keep one family from venturing out last Saturday night in the city, and it wasn't to see \"The Lion King.\" (That had been done the night before.) The parents were desperate for high culture -- the Summergarden classical-music concerts at the Museum of Modern Art, in this case -- and were even optimistic that the children might appreciate it (or, at worst, be lulled to sleep).   But the thunderstorm got in the way and the concert was canceled. The family returned home in the rain, uninspired and unhappy. Maybe another family will have better luck this weekend or next. The concerts, performed by musicians from the Juilliard School, are in their eighth year; the theme this summer is early 20th-century music.   \"It's not fairy-tale music,\" said Sheila Porter, the concert's publicity agent, \"but some kids really dig the music.\" The informality of Summergarden has, in fact, been attracting families (including infants, Ms. Porter said), even though it makes for a late evening. (The free concerts begin at 8:30 and end by 10 P.M.) There are no formal intermissions, but brief gaps between pieces allow families to make swift, discreet exits, if necessary. Just don't knock over the Lachaise with your stroller.   The garden opens at 6 P.M. for the 8:30 P.M. concerts, on Friday and Saturday nights. Ms. Porter suggests arriving by 7 P.M. to get one of the 400 garden chairs (some people take their own seating). Sandwiches, juice, wine and beer are sold in the garden, and dinner is served in the museum's restaurant from 5 to 11:30 P.M. (The museum is also open on Fridays until 8:30 P.M. and Saturdays until 6 P.M.) This weekend, the program is music for piano; next weekend, the Mosaic String Quartet is to play. Keep in Mind    \"REVEALING ROOTS: UNCOVERING INFLUENCES ON CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN PUPPET THEATER,\" an exhibition of various styles of puppets, divided by culture and heritage, including African, Mexican, Japanese, Indonesian, American Northwest and European traditions. Through Sept. 30. Hours: Monday and Thursday, noon to 8 P.M. and Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, noon to 6 P.M.

Kerlin Learning Center, Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx. Tomorrow and Sunday, 1 to 4 P.M. Free with museum admission: $4 for adults, $2 for children 6 and up. Information: (718) 549-3200.    \"SKY HUNTERS '94,\" a summer program featuring demonstrations by, and examinations of, birds of prey, including an African fish eagle that plunges 43 feet onto a stage, owls and a baby Andean condor. At the Bronx Zoo, Bronx River Parkway at Fordham Road. Show times: 11:30 A.M., 1:30 and 3:30 P.M. daily except Wednesday, weather permitting, through Labor Day. Free with admission to the zoo: $5.75 for adults, $2 for children 2 through 12; free under 2. Parking is $5. Information: (718) 367-1010.    \"BLOCKS IN HAND,\" an exhibition of mid-19th-century and contemporary construction-set toys, with an area for children to make their own buildings. At the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 39 Sco fieldtown Road, Stamford, Conn. Hours: 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through Saturday and holidays; 1 to 5 P.M., Sunday. Fees: $4 for adults and $3 for children. Information: (203) 322-1646.    \"THE TRAVELING TREE,\" a new children's musical about a businessman who wants to pave over a garden, a tree that has feelings and a businesswoman who is ambivalent about her work. At Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village. Saturdays and Sundays, 1 P.M. Tickets, $6. Information: (212) 627-2961.

The \"Archduke\" came to the Mostly Mozart Festival at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday, preceded by an early Mozart Flute Quartet in C (K. 285B) and followed by the Mendelssohn E-flat Octet.

The U.S. could use its market dominance to try to get other leading producer countries to agree to restrain the arms trade.

He was probably the more popular of the two at the Volvo, where he first gained attention in 1990, when he upset top-seeded Ivan Lendl in the first round and then reached the final the next year. Becker never lost his serve and broke Washington's three times in recording a 6-2, 6-4 victory at the Connecticut Tennis Center.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940820","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/20/sports/results-plus-015563.html","abstract":"  TRACK AND FIELD Christie Wins and Torrance Pulls Upset  Two days after outsprinting the best field assembled this year, in Zurich, Linford Christie of Britain won another 100-meter race yesterday, beating Dennis Mitchell of the United States at the Van Damme Memorial track meet in Brussels. But the winning streak of a Russian, Irina Privalova, in the women's 100 was ended by another American, Gwen Torrance. The 34-year-old Christie won in 10.03 seconds even though he was somewhat slow out of the blocks because of wet conditions. Torrance ran the second best women's time of the season, 10.83 seconds, in easily beating Merlene Ottey of Jamaica. Privalova, who beat Torrance in Zurich, was well back. The British hurdler Colin Jackson stayed on course for the pot of gold to be awarded to any athlete who can win his or her event in each of the Golden Four meets in Oslo, Zurich, Brussels and Berlin. The German meet will be held on Aug. 30. Jackson won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.22 seconds. (AP) GOLF Plus-14 Vaults Lowery Into Lead  Showing little fear of sand and little regard for his better-known competitors, Steve Lowery carded seven birdies in a bogey-free round yesterday to take the lead at the halfway point of the International in Castle Rock, Colo. Lowery, whose best finish in seven seasons on the PGA Tour was a second at San Diego this year, earned 14 points and had a two-round total of 21 points under the modified Stableford system. Equaling Lowery's plus-14 as the day's best score was Dave Stockton Jr., who was at plus-20 along with Mike Reid. First-round leader Bruce Lietzke, dropped from 16 points to 14 under the scoring system in which a player receives 8 points for a double eagle, 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or worse. (AP) Putt Canceled on Account of Tornado Threat: Ellie Gibson didn't get a chance to attempt a 25-foot birdie putt for the lead on the final hole yesterday because lightning and the threat of a tornado forced the suspension of play at the L.P.G.A. Chicago Challenge. Gibson, who began the day a shot behind first-round leader Katie Peterson-Parker, was tied for the lead with six others at 7-under par when play was halted. She was among 11 players scheduled to complete the second round this morning. Peterson-Parker, who shot a 72, was tied with Kathryn Marshall, Janice Gibson, Michelle Estill, Dale Eggeling and Jane Geddes at 137. (AP) My Son, the Caddie: With his golf pro son, Tad, serving as his caddy, Dick Rhyan shot a 6-under-par 66 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Burnet Senior Classic in Coon Rapids, Minn. \"Tad was on the (PGA) Tour last year but he lost his card. He's getting ready to go to tour qualifying school. He's been caddying for me for three weeks and we haven't been over par.\" Rhyan said. Tom Weiskopf and George Archer were one stroke back. (AP) ROLLER HOCKEY New Jersey Loses in Playoff Opener   The Buffalo Stampede pushed the New Jersey Rockin Rollers to the brink of playoff elimination last night with a 9-6 victory before 5,431 spectators at the Brendan Byrne Arena. Buffalo was led by its goaltender, Nick Vitucci, who made 34 saves, and Len Soccio, who scored 2 goals. New Jersey got a pair of goals from both Yves Heroux and Chris Belanger.   The Rockin Rollers will face the Stampede in Game 2 at the Buffalo Auditorium tomorrow night, and must win that contest to keep their playoff hopes alive. If New Jersey is victorious, a 12-minute mini-game will be played right after to decide which team advances in the International Roller Hockey League playoffs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940820","headline":"After Mexico Votes, The Old Will Still Resist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/20/opinion/IHT-after-mexico-votes-the-old-will-still-resist.html","abstract":"The cave, really an enormous rock shelter up on a cliff face, looks out upon what is called a thorn forest, a thick green canopy of mesquite pierced by hundreds of straight, soaring organo cacti.

I have climbed Split Rock light in Minnesota, perched above the sheer cliffs of Lake Superior, and enjoyed a panorama of San Diego harbor from the grounds of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse.   I was therefore somewhat skeptical about the lure of the Hudson's lights. They aren't as tall as most nor as famous. They aren't on puzzles or postage stamps or even in most travel books. But after recently visiting the four lighthouses open to the public, I was amply rewarded by stunning views of the river, the Palisades and the Catskills; one of the lighthouses, in Saugerties, even accommodates overnight guests.  Jeffrey's Hook   Known to millions as the \"Little Red Lighthouse\" because it is the subject of the children's classic \"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge,\" Jeffrey's Hook is the only lighthouse on Manhattan. Even so, many New Yorkers are surprised to discover it exists.

The critic's compositions are performed by leading orchestras, chamber musicians and singers around the country, sometimes with the composer conducting. When a new composition by this critic is presented in New York, another music critic from the paper reviews it, almost always favorably. After six years on the job, the critic wins a Pulitzer Prize, not for criticism but for composition. And far from being embarrassed, the editors of the paper boast in print of the critic's accomplishment.   Though unthinkable today, this was the situation of Virgil Thomson during his 14 years at The New York Herald Tribune. When he left the paper 40 years ago this fall, his career as composer and performer foundered for a time, and music criticism lost one of its perkiest, most provocative voices. Even those who devalue Thomson as a composer concede that he may have been the most brilliant music critic the United States has produced. Yet his appointment arose out of a singular set of circumstances that could not be duplicated today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Southwest Brooklyn Presses Its Economic Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-red-hook-gowanus-southwest-brooklyn-presses-its-economic.html","abstract":"  There are no greengrocers, no pharmacies, no bakeries in Red Hook.

But it would increase coverage above current rates and reform insurance laws so that ill people could not be discriminated against and workers could carry insurance from job to job. The plan is too flawed to be inspiring, but a bill based on this proposal is probably the only one the Senate can pass anytime soon.   The choice, then, is between passing something like the mainstream proposal and passing no bill at all. Because the proposal would do some good and no major harm, it is worth grabbing. It is a valuable first step in an incremental process of reform, and as such it should not be allowed to slip away.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"WHAT'S DOING IN;\nSan Francisco","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/travel/whats-doing-in-san-francisco.html","abstract":"After complaining about the heavy fog this summer, San Franciscans should be rewarded with their sunny season in September and October, the ideal time to walk the city, sit in a park listening to a concert or scale one of the 42 hills for a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the downtown skyline.\n\n A recent, somewhat controversial addition to the city's landscape is the 65 Canary Island date palms that have been planted along the docks in the Embarcadero area, supposedly to cheer up the place.

He quit his job selling life insurance and was soon appearing regularly at local comedy clubs for $25 a night. Within months he was on the road, making the best of things in places like Vermillion, S.D., and Rockingham, N.C. Facing down drunks and racist hecklers, he impressed audiences with his high-energy, edgy, observational humor. He joked about his childhood, being a parent, working, current events. He had one act for white audiences; another, edgier, for black clubs. Within five or six years Mr. Harvey was a headliner making $1,000 a week at big-city comedy clubs. Soon after, he was bringing in $2,500 a week playing resorts and performing regularly on pay-cable stand-up-comedy specials.   In short, his is a classic American success story -- or classic enough, anyway, for the talent-hungry executives who put together ABC's sitcom-heavy lineup. This fall he will star in \"Me and the Boys,\" a new half-hour family comedy at 8:30 P.M.

It came in a handsome wooden box, and contained a rack for test tubes as well as niches where vials of powerful powders might be kept. There was a little packet of sensitive paper (litmus, I think), a knobbed glass rod, the obligatory manual, a metal loop for suspending a test tube over a flame, a conversion table (ounces into spoons) and suitably exciting poison labels. Dreams flew out of that box when its lid was lifted: dreams of bombs and poisons, of plots described in disappearing ink, of odors distressful to the weak. I set up a small lab in the basement and there I performed my experiments. \"Performed\" is the right word. \"Experiment\" is not. For I didn't follow the booklet where it led or listen to its lectures. I slopped about, blending yellow with white and obtaining brown, mixing crystals with powders and getting dust, combining liquids with solids and making mud.\n\nLater, in high school, I would take chemistry the way I took spring tonics and swallowed headache pills. Although I broke beakers and popped little pieces of potassium into puddles of water to watch the water fly, I did occasionally manage to obey tutorial instructions as well, repeating experiments that others had long ago undertaken. My predecessors had asked their questions of nature with genuine curiosity and awaited, like eager suitors, her reply. My method displayed a different spirit, which was to fudge my procedures in order to obtain the result already written in the chemmy books. I was not being taught to experiment or even to repeat experiments. I was being taught to cheat.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Dispute Snarls the Restoration of Astor Row","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-dispute-snarls-the-restoration-of-astor-row.html","abstract":"  Two years ago, city officials and preservationists, including Brooke Astor and then-Mayor David N.

Originally a statement that the United States opposed the establishment of monarchical governments and new colonial regimes in the Western Hemisphere by European nations, the doctrine went largely unnoticed at first by the European powers. Yet as American strength grew over the years, so did foreign respect for Monroe's warning, and by the beginning of the 20th century it had assumed a mythical place in the national consciousness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/c-corrections-027308.html","abstract":"  A map on page 3 of the Travel section today with a Correspondent's Report about the new Kansai International Airport in Japan locates it incorrectly.

So it should have come as no surprise that the Fox television network last month telecast a special on which LOYALTY AND BETRAYAL: The Story of the American Mob (Lookout/Collins, paper, $19.95) is based. Crammed with photographs of some of this country's most notorious gangsters -- including Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky and John Gotti -- the book unfortunately also comes with some banal and overheated prose by Sidney Zion. Mr. Zion, the author of \"The Autobiography of Roy Cohn\" and a columnist at The Daily News, should know better. Consider the following: \"On Oct. 23, 1935, Charles (the Bug) Workman strode into a Newark chophouse and ventilated the 33-year-old Schultz with hot lead.\" Or this: \"Of course, if the Combination\" -- the name the mob called itself in its early years -- \"had been running the country in the 30's instead of just feasting on it, Hitler would have been buried in his brown shirt the first time he showed up in a Berlin beer hall. And the Japanese warlords would have been whacked out by Murder Inc. before the new moon turned on the Rising Sun.\" However, the photographs, ranging from one showing Dutch Schultz lying on a hospital gurney examining his fatal wounds to an image of the lifeless body of Abraham (Kid Twist) Reles spread out on a ledge five stories below the hotel window from which he fell (or more likely was pushed), are fascinating and sometimes chilling. And resist the temptation just to flip through \"Loyalty and Betrayal,\" looking only at the pictures -- you would miss the odd, unexplained datum that makes the book fun, like Schultz's final words: \"French Canadian bean soup.

Part of it, certainly, is that rock bands draw bigger, younger audiences than conventional chamber groups do. They also allow greater freedom in stage behavior and dress. But most important, rock bands generally compose their own music, and chamber ensembles do not.   Young ensembles have been rebelling against these strictures for some time. First they challenged the sartorial rules (Tashi in the 1970's, Kronos in the 80's).

The computer in the New Orleans regional Passport Agency, one of 13 national centers, collapsed on July 9 and 10 when someone turned off the air-conditioning, for one thing, and the work had to be dispersed to other regions. But the main cause of trauma, according to Gary Sheaffer of the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, applications for new and renewed passports have been running 23 percent ahead of last year. In 1993, 2.3 million were processed through June; this year the figure for the same period is put at 2.9 million. The total of 1993 applications, 4.2 million, itself represented a 10 percent increase over 1992.    On a hot day at the end of July, at the New York Passport Agency at 630 Fifth Avenue, which handles only people who have made appointments because of an emergency or because they are holding tickets for the next few days, the line ran half the length of the block from Fifth Avenue to Sixth. William Collins Jr., manager of the New York region, said that the increase at Fifth Avenue was greater than 23 percent, although a comparison with 1993 is not valid because he closed an office at 201 Varick Street in February and transferred the staff uptown, raising the office's capacity from 750 passports a day to 1,250. In the peak week, the week of July 4, he said, the office worked at capacity, turning out 1,250 a day. The figures are still high; on July 22, the total was 767 and on July 25, 882.  A Hard Time    So this is not an easy time to get a passport. January might have been a good time, or February perhaps. But the best-organized people seem to be disheveled this summer; among those who have told me recently that they were scurrying to get passports at the last minute are a relative, a co-worker and even an official in the Consular Affairs Bureau, all of whom neglected to check the expiration dates until the last minute.
