This means that he was an astute observer of major artistic events as well as a participant in them, beginning with the founding of the Group Theater in 1931.    His memoir, \"All People Are Famous,\" was a step removed from autobiography. It was, he said, \"about myself through others.\" One might suggest that the posthumous new book, \"The Collected Works of Harold Clurman\" (Applause Books), is about Clurman through the plays he saw.

One can talk of admirable works for solo cello by Reger, Kodaly, Hindemith and Ligeti, but it was Britten who approached the unapproachable, writing utterly private music that thought aloud in intermingling confessional voices.   Like all of Britten's late cello pieces, the Third Suite was written for Mstislav Rostropovich; with its filigree of Russian quotations and huge passacaglia climax, it also has strong links to the music of Shostakovich. Mr. Rostropovich ceased performing the work in public after Britten's death, finding the personal associations too difficult to bear, but other cellists have confronted its great technical as well as emotional challenges. Colin Carr, who performed the Suite alongside Kodaly's solo Sonata at the Kaye Playhouse on Tuesday night, knows the idiom as well as any.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"Small Businesses Certainly Do Create Jobs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/opinion/l-small-businesses-certainly-do-create-jobs-705098.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Myth: Small Business as Job Engine\" (Business Day, March 25) tries to make the case that large companies are at least as proficient as small ones at job creation.

On a bad night they can make a listener thank punk rock for plowing guitar-playing windbags six feet under. The band's show at the Beacon Theater on Tuesday night veered between the two extremes, and for the most part the audience loved it all. Punk rock may have completely altered the rock landscape, but the Allman Brothers, who finish an eight-night, sold-out stand at the Beacon this weekend, don't seem to care, and neither does the band's adoring audience.   The group sells the sound of the guitar, and all the freedom and wildness that, in rock, the instrument implies. Over the years the band has been transformed from a sleek and swinging group to something more ponderous. The jazz influences have given way to a rock heaviness, and at Tuesday's show the music had its bloated and slow moments, sounding thick around the middle. At times Warren Haynes, who has completely absorbed the sound of Duane Allman, the group's original guitarist, pulled together solos of melodic beauty; he and the group's other guitarist, Dickey Betts, aren't afraid of using major scales to produce melodies. At other times he just kept making the same point over and over.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"Casillas Joins Chiefs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/sports/sports-people-football-casillas-joins-chiefs.html","abstract":"  The Kansas City Chiefs signed TONY CASILLAS, an unrestricted free agent, to a four-year, $6 million contract and released running back HARVEY WILLIAMS, a former No. 1 draft pick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940407","headline":"In Italy, the Right Wing Squabbles Over Spoils","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/world/in-italy-the-right-wing-squabbles-over-spoils.html","abstract":"  The rift in Italy's victorious, right-wing electoral alliance widened today as Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who led the voting in last month's national elections, threatened to force a new ballot, while his nominal ally appealed to other political parties for support in his campaign to change the country from a republic to a federation.

Fernandez, seeded fifth, was eliminated in a second-round match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, by 144th-ranked Petra Langrova of the Czech Republic. Fernandez has not won a tournament in more than a year. She had not competed since February when her title defense at Indian Wells, Calif., ended prematurely with a loss to Amanda Coetzer in the quarterfinals. Fernandez underwent surgery last year for endometriosis, a gynecological condition, and continues to experience side effects from the medication she takes to prevent the problem from recurring. Yesterday she complained of fatigue, but she attributed the loss to Langrova's dogged and error-free play in the third set.

Like nearly all the dramatic works by this 18th-century Frenchman, \"Triumph\" is concerned with love, how it comes about, how it can be helped along and what effect it has on usually rational people. In the course of the play, Phocion, an enterprising young lad, sees to it that three of the major characters fall head over heels for him.

On Wednesday the police spread a wider net across New York City, rounding up 216 truants.    Thus began the Police Department's new program to combat school truancy. Whether it is the best use of police resources or the most effective way to get students back to school remains to be seen. But the problem it addresses is real.    On any given day, about 15 percent of the city's 1.1 million students are absent from school. Some absences are legitimate, many are not. Students hanging out on the streets can become perpetrators -- and victims -- of crime.

Musicians work better warmed up, and performances build not in the chronology of sound bites, but at length. The show, which was meant to be packaged for PBS, kept the performances short and sandwiched between simple introductions read by the hosts Vanessa Williams and Herbie Hancock. And musicians were hustled on and off stage for virtually every tune, destroying any sense of continuity.   Still, the concert, more than three hours long and heavy with jazz stars, had moments of real beauty. Meant to cover a good portion of the label's history, from its founder Norman Granz's first concert in 1944 to the contemporary fusion it sells today, the show almost by definition had to wrestle with Verve's immense history as well as the paucity of the original performers. Verve is lucky: it has spent a good portion of the last several years cultivating older musicians, and on occasion they came through.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940408","headline":"Starks Pushing For Playoffs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/08/sports/starks-pushing-for-playoffs.html","abstract":"  Less than a month after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, John Starks was on the Madison Square Garden court, gingerly taking jump shots before last night's Knicks-Cavaliers game.

Period costume drama, elegantly produced, has returned triumphantly to British television, which in turn, of course, means our own \"Masterpiece Theater.\" \"Middlemarch\" begins a six-week run Sunday on the PBS series.    The British enthusiasm is quite understandable. Apart from providing a whopping good story with romances and schemings to spare, George Eliot -- a pen name for Mary Ann Evans, who thought, correctly, she would have more literary acceptance with a man's name -- creates in astonishing detail an enclosed English village in which it was still possible to \"make one's way,\" by hook or crook. Everyone knew everyone else. Accents might vary but all faces were white. People knew their place. Society might have its faults, but there was no doubt that England represented civilization at its most advanced.

Although the between-song patter has its stiff moments, the musical performances have the loose-jointed volubility of a jam session conducted by longtime colleagues who like to swing while avoiding any suggestion of high drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940408","headline":"Bill Clinton's Arteries -- and Ours","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/08/opinion/bill-clinton-s-arteries-and-ours.html","abstract":"  Ask around Little Rock and they tell it to you straight: Bill Clinton when he was Governor could really chow down.

The second New York African Film Festival, co-sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and African Film Festival Inc., begins tonight and will run for more than two weeks at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. An African film festival is especially welcome because of the infrequency with which African films are shown here commercially. (The Ethiopian-financed \"Sankofa,\" opening today at the Harlem Victoria Five Theater, is a notable exception.) It's also welcome because Africa's diverse cultures offer such a wealth of thematic possibilities and because so many of these little-known works happen to be so good.    The series includes 11 first features along with a couple of old favorites, like the 1990 \"Tilai\" from Idrissa Ouedraogo, the film maker from Burkina Faso whose works have the eloquence and simplicity of folk tales. The films, from 13 countries, deal with subjects as diverse as life in pre-colonial Africa (Gaston Kabore's \"Wend Kuuni,\" Burkina Faso, 1982) to the romance between an African student and his Russian lover (Abderrahmane Sissako's \"October,\" a 37-minute work from Mauritania, 1992).

Actually, slimmed-down understates the case. Of the 50-odd paintings and prints at Allentown, only 15 appear here, packed into a small, difficult space.
