But we cannot afford to lose it. The national sleep deficit is bigger than the budget deficit. Sleep researchers have spent millions of dollars to discover what everyone knew already. This is a nation of insomniacs. Eighty percent of Americans are sleep-deprived. They get only six or seven hours of sleep, instead of eight or nine, which adds up to a whole night lost every week.\n\nLack of sleep is a national disease, responsible for everything from our dismal job performance to our rotten sex lives. A Government report last year estimated that sleepy drivers were responsible for one-third of all fatal accidents, or 10,000 deaths a year. Airline pilots and train engineers doze at the controls, operators of nuclear power plants blink sleepily at their instrument panel, and supermarket checkout clerks often seem to be sleepwalking through the groceries in a coma.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Go Ahead, Make Him Cry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/movies/go-ahead-make-him-cry.html","abstract":"  CLINT EASTWOOD APPEARED.

From what they left behind and from the configurations of their tiny stone cities, we have guessed that the people were tiny, that they ate corn and sheep, that life was communal, egalitarian and precarious.   Keet Seel and Betatakin, ruins of two villages built into the cliffs of Navajo National Monument Park in northern Arizona, are among the most remote and best preserved of the Anasazi ruins. Though the stonework lacks the precision of the walls at Chaco Canyon, in New Mexico, and the kivas (ceremonial rooms) and rock art are less elaborate, the settings -- giant alcoves in sandstone cliffs inaccessible by road -- are spectacular. Because of the shelter of the alcoves and the difficulty of getting there, much of both villages, even the stick-and-mud roofs, is intact, and potsherds, arrowheads, corncobs and sheep vertebrae can still be found on the ground.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Behind the Scenes At 2 Top Bakeries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/behind-the-scenes-at-2-top-bakeries.html","abstract":"IN a gritty section of Jersey City, Uni-Bake sits in a low building surrounded by auto body shops.

A peninsula connected to the rest of Tasmania by only a 400-yard-wide isthmus, and separated from mainland Australia by 250 miles of ocean, Port Arthur was for nearly 50 years the last stop for incorrigibles in the British penal system. But 100 years after the last prisoner left Port Arthur, and 15 years after the start of a concerted effort to restore the site, the former penal colony is now Tasmania's No. 1 tourist attraction -- last year it was visited by more than 180,000 people. On a late summer day, when the sun shines brilliantly on the lush green fields that cover the prison grounds and reflects off the sailboats in the surrounding waters, it is hard to believe Port Arthur was the setting for some of the harshest discipline meted out since the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nI began my journey, as did most of the convicts sentenced to spend time there, in Hobart, Tasmania's capital.

One of the largest, spookiest, most legend-enshrouded and least known to foreign visitors is the Spessart -- 800 square miles of wooded hill country east of Frankfurt, tucked between bends of the Main River and one of its tributaries, the Kinzig. \n\nThe Spessart, Hessian-Franconian vernacular for Spechtswald, which means \"woodpecker forest,\" gained notoriety in the 19th century through the novelist Wilhelm Hauff's stories about highway robbers who waylaid travelers and had their hideouts there in isolated inns. The bandits were not fiction, for highway robbery was once a plague in these woods, though Hauff, a fervid romantic, depicted them as Teutonic versions of Robin Hood and made their lairs seem eerily frightening.\n\nThe Grimm brothers, brought up in Steinau, one of the forest's most picturesque towns, used the Spessart as the setting for many of their fairy tales. Those, locals insist, were not all fiction either.  Today the lore serves as enchanting background to one of Germany's most rewarding and relaxing travel destinations. It can be explored in four to five days with about 200 miles of driving, primarily on scenic country roads, between the principal sights. For business visitors it is also an ideal long weekend out of Frankfurt, which is only 45 miles from the heart of the Spessart.\n\nMiltenberg, population 9,500, is a good starting point and base for discovering the forest's southern -- Bavarian -- part and the wine country around the gently flowing Main, which has become a major artery for barges carrying freight between the North and Black Seas since opening of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992. The town is also a port for leisurely excursion-boat trips along the river. Much of the red sandstone, characteristic of the Spessart's architecture, is quarried at and around Miltenberg.\n\nMiltenberg was a Roman military base as early as A.D. 160, but its golden era was the 14th through 16th centuries, thanks to the prince-archbishops of Mainz, who built Miltenburg Castle, which is spelled differently. The castle, which stands on the steepest hill overlooking the town, served both as a border point and customs station to levy duty on the traffic on the river. \n\nMost of the half-timbered, steep-roofed houses of its medieval merchants, craftsmen, sandstone quarriers and wine dealers still line the narrow, cobblestone main street that curves for almost a mile between the river and the densely wooded hillside. \n\nA seven-mile drive south from Miltenberg and the Main leads to Amorbach and a startling change of architectural eras: from Gothic and Renaissance to late Baroque, due mainly to this small town's beautiful Abbey Church.\n\nAmorbach and its abbey were founded in 734 by Irish Benedictines who played a key role in Christianizing the Germans. In 1734, while celebrating the monastery's millenium, the Mainz archbishop decided to replace the whole Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic complex with one in the Baroque style, which was then fashionable. \n\nThe architect, Maximilian von Welsch, retained famous stucco and fresco artists such as Johann Feichtmayr and Matthaus Gunther to do the interior decorating. It took only seven years to complete the opulent, eye-dazzling ensemble. The monks capped it with a new organ, which has almost 5,000 pipes and 63 registers.\n\nThe glory of Amorbach ended in 1803 when Napoleon redrew the map of Europe.  He abolished the German church-states, secularized the abbey and gave it to the Counts of Leiningen in compensation for properties in Alsace-Lorraine that they had ceded to the French. The Leiningen family still owns and runs the complex.\n\nThe only way to see its splendid interiors -- a whirl of gilded stucco, Gunther's breathtaking ceiling frescoes of scenes from the life of St. Benedict, Feichtmayr's trompe l'oeil effects -- is on guided German-language tours that are conducted at 40-minute intervals daily March through October. They include the richly decorated abbey library with its 30,000 volumes and the Green Room, which was the abbot's reception chamber.\n\nFrom Miltenberg it is 20 winding, scenic miles northeast and upstream along the river to Wertheim, a picture postcard town of 20,000 beneath the ruins of its 11th-century castle at the confluence of the Tauber River with the Main. First mentioned in documents in 779, it was for nearly 800 years -- until 1806 -- the capital of an independent principality ruled by a succession of noble dynasties. Its partly walled old quarter is a pedestrian zone; a half-day of walking here, and a climb to the castle ruin 300 feet above the town, will take you to the most important sights. Among these are the 14th-century Collegiate Church, the Historical Museum in the former Renaissance-style City Hall and the Glass Museum.\n\nFrom the early Middle Ages until the Nazi Third Reich, Wertheim had one of the Main River valley's largest Jewish communities. But they were often the victims of persecution long before the Holocaust. One of the worst pogroms was in the early 15th century. A reminder of it is St. Mary's Chapel, a small church built in 1447 on the ruins of what had been the town's oldest synagogue. The old Jewish cemetery on the outskirts, at the base of the castle hill, has been fenced off since Germany's latest wave of neo-Nazi violence and can only be visited by applying for a key from the city administration. But at its gate there is a bronze tablet, commemorating by name the 38 Jews who were still living in Wertheim in 1942, when the Final Solution started. They were all subsequently deported to death camps.\n\nThe 21-mile drive north and upstream from Wertheim to Lohr leads through the loveliest section of the Main Valley and one of the lushest parts of the Spessart. Two hamlets along this route -- Rothenfels and Neustadt-am-Main -- merit a stop. Rothenfels was once a principal fishing and shipping center on the Main. Some 450 feet above its snug, crazily leaning half-timbered houses is a perfectly preserved 12th-century castle that nowadays serves as a youth hostel. Neustadt-am-Main, three miles farther, was founded in 769 as a Benedictine abbey. Its red sandstone basilica is a rare example of pure Romanesque architecture. The monastery, rebuilt after destruction during the Napoleonic secularization, is now the European headquarters of the Dominican order and a training center for missionary work in Africa.\n\nLohr, population 17,000, the eastern \"gate to the Spessart,\" is a picturesque maze of narrow cobblestone streets, medieval watchtowers, Gothic church spires and half-timbered houses. More important, citing research by Karlheinz Barthels, a local pharmacist and \"fabulologist,\" it maintains it is the real Snow White town. According to Barthels, she lived in Lohr's moated, turreted 14th-century castle, which now houses the Spessart Museum.\n\nThe Spessart Museum with its walk-in exhibits of life in the area centuries ago can keep you busy for hours, especially the horror chamber that describes the real highwaymen who robbed teamsters and mail coaches in the Spessart in the 1700's and early 1800's.\n\nThere are no fairy tales associated with Mespelbrunn castle, 19 miles southwest of Lohr, though it would be a perfect stage set for one. The salmon-colored Gothic-Renaissance chateau is tucked into a hilly landscape of dark, lush woods and surrounded by a broad moat. \n\nThe castle has been the property of the Counts of Ingelheim-Echter von und zu Mespelbrunn for over 500 years, and they still live in it, but they open one of the three wings to visitors daily, from March through November, except when a family event is being celebrated. \n\nThe highlights are the knights' hall with its coffered ceiling and hunting trophies, the 15th-century chapel with its beautiful stained glass windows and alabaster altar, the main dining room with its 16th-century fireplace and collection of armor and weapons and the Chinese room, crammed with Chinese and East Asian porcelain, furnishings and bric-a-brac.\n\nFrom Mespelbrunn it is 11 miles northwest to Aschaffenburg, a city of 65,000, named for the little Aschaff River, a tributary of the Main. Though its written history goes back to the seventh century, the town entered its golden era in 1260 when the prince-bishops of Mainz chose it as their second residence. It was they who built its splendid 17th-century Johannisburg Palace on a promontory overlooking the Main and who richly endowed its SS. Peter and Alexander Collegiate Church.\n\nMuch of the city was destroyed during World War II, and what little of architectural value remained was demolished by urban renewal in the 1960's.\n\nEven the massive, three-story Renaissance palace was gutted and not restored in its entirety until the 1970's. Built entirely of Miltenberg red sandstone on the ruins of an earlier archdiocesal castle, it is overwhelming in its dimensions and symmetry: four wings, each nearly 290 feet long, enclosing a 26,000 square foot courtyard, with four corner towers more than 170 feet high. The enormous building today houses a number of government offices and three major museums. The Palace Museum encompasses eight ornately furnished rooms of the Mainz archbishops and princes. The Pompeianum, in the Palace Garden, is an exact copy of a house in Pompeii, commissioned by Bavaria's King Ludwig I in 1843. This building, too, was almost totally destroyed in World War II and finally reopened -- as a museum of Roman antiquities -- in August 1994.\n\nAschaffenburg's Collegiate Church, 10 minutes' walk from the palace, is an example of late-Romanesque and early-Gothic styles from the 12th and 13th centuries. The church abounds with ecclesiastical art, including a small \"Lamentation of Christ\" by Matthias Grunewald, done when he lived in Aschaffenburg.\n\nFrom Aschaffenburg the route into the state of Hesse's section of the Spessart leads 12 miles north through Alzenau, a romantically situated town, crowned by a 14th-century castle, and from there 15 miles northwest to Gelnhausen.\n\nSet on a steep hillside above the Kinzig River, Gelnhausen looks frozen in the Middle Ages when it was one of the most important points on the main trade route between Frankfurt and Leipzig. It is a treasure trove of narrow, winding cobblestone streets lined by crazily tilting half-timbered houses, some of them almost 800 years old, and it is still partly enclosed by its medieval wall.\n\nGelnhausen was chartered in 1170 by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa after he had built a huge, partially fortified palace there on the banks of the Kinzig. The ruins of that castle with its elaborately carved Romanesque arches and capitals are among the must-see sites.\n\nThe town was booming by 1200 when work began on its St. Mary's Church, a vast red sandstone structure with four Romanesque and Gothic spires that can be seen from miles away. Among its interior furnishings are fine 13th-century stained glass windows, ornately carved choir stalls, an intricately sculptured rood screen, a polychrome high altar from 1500 and 15th-century tapestries.\n\nGelnhausen, historically, had a large and illustrious Jewish community. The most poignant reminders of this are the old cemetery down by the river bank not far from the Barbarossa castle, and the 17th-century synagogue on Brentano Strasse.\n\nBecause the synagogue had previously been secularized and forcibly sold to a non-Jew who was using it as a warehouse, it was one of the very few synagogues in Germany that escaped destruction in the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938. Now owned by the city, it was restored in 1986 and has been used since then as a cultural center, art gallery and concert hall. Its elaborately gilded, stucco-marble Torah ark is one of the few left from the Baroque period.\n\nSalt that bubbled forth from subterranean springs was one of the Spessart Forest's principal export products in the Middle Ages. One of its main sources, exploited since the 11th century, was at Bad Orb, eight miles northeast of Gelnhausen. The springs are still bubbling, but since 1837, when a local pharmacist began using the waters for medicinal purposes, the town has been a spa and health resort. Sixty thousand people converge on Bad Orb each year to take the waters; driving on 10 more miles to Steinau is more relaxing.\n\nSteinau-an-der-Strasse is where the Grimm brothers -- Jacob and Wilhelm -- who collected and wrote down all the famous fairy tales, spent their boyhood years, after their father had been appointed the local magistrate in 1791. They lived in the 16th-century Renaissance courthouse, which is now the local museum. \n\nSteinau has a history going back to about the year 700 and was chartered as a city and market place in 1290. It was an important junction on the salt and trade routes in the Middle Ages, and long a piece of real estate contested by the prince-bishops of Fulda and the counts of Hanau.\n\nWhen the Hanau counts gained control, they fortified the town and built a moated castle with walls over 90 feet high, a daunting challenge to the bandits who lurked in the Spessart. Today it ranks as one of the largest and best preserved Renaissance castles in Germany. It, too, is a museum, open daily except Mondays, with a fine collection of 15th- to 18th-century furnishings, Flemish Gobelins and a permanent exhibition of documents dealing with Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, and their younger brother Ludwig, who was an artist and provided illustrations for some of their fairy tale collections.\n\nSteinau has a vibrant cultural life as well. Central to it is the Marionettentheater, a puppet theater in the 16th-century stables of the castle. The family that runs it performs Grimm classics such as \"Snow White,\" \"Rumpelstiltskin,\" \"Cinderella,\" \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Puss in Boots\" almost daily.\nA SAMPLING OF ATTRACTIONS ALONG THE MEANDERING MAIN\nGetting There\n\n All destinations are within an hour's drive from Frankfurt or about four hours from Munich, using autobahn routes.\nGetting Around \n\nIt is advisable to take along a very detailed road map or road atlas (Shell and Aral are the best), though road signs are clear. The HB Bild Atlas No. 23 Odenwald-Spessart has very detailed maps but descriptions of the towns and destinations in German only. It is available at bookstores and gas stations in the area. \n\nThe country code for Germany is 49; when dialing a phone number within the country, the area code should be preceded with a 0.\n\nMain River boat trips are best from Miltenberg. There are round trips from Miltenberg to Wertheim on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and local excursions to the locks every hour daily, May through October: Personenschiffsreederei Henneberger, Mainanlage, D-63897 Miltenberg; telephone (9371) 3330.\nWhere to Stay \n\nAll prices include breakfast, taxes and service.\n\nMILTENBERG: Hotel zum Riesen, 97 Hauptstrasse, D-63897 Miltenberg; (9371) 3644.

But today it has grown beyond its modest asphalt roots to become one of the borough's major power brokers.   Umma -- the name is derived from the Arabic word for community -- began as an informal group of eight Muslim families who would pray together and then discuss the problems of their North Flatbush community. Those discussions led to the formation of a civilian patrol that, at its inception, was \"well-intentioned but very green,\" said Ed Powell, who founded the group along with James Burns.    As the patrol grew, so did its visibility and its reputation as a group able to effect change. As a result, residents and community groups in Midwood and North Flatbush now rely on Umma for services ranging from ousting drug dealers from apartment buildings to helping landlords collect rent from delinquent tenants to running a day care center.    Umma seems to reach into every corner of central Brooklyn -- it trains civilian and tenant patrols, administers a playground on behalf of the Parks Department (which named the playground Umma Park after the group rid it of suspected drug dealers) and sponsors youth leadership and recreation programs. Mr. Powell himself is directly involved in several political or civic groups and is second vice chairman of Community Board 14.   Mr. Powell's political experience has paid off. Umma can call on, and get results from, such sources as the local police precinct commander and political representatives up to former Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, who donated $3,000 in equipment. In return, these sources gain a liaison with Umma's constituency, much of which has been historically distrustful of government and police.   \"Their credibility is very strong,\" said Inspector Patrick D. Brennan, commander of the 70th Precinct.   Mr. Powell and Mr. Burns concede that cooperation with government and police officials has cost them support among those who preferred the group's initial militant posture, when they patrolled the streets in military fatigues. But Mr. Powell contended that critics -- like those who denounced the group for trying to mediate a peaceful end to a well-publicized boycott against a Korean grocery store owner in late 1991 -- are \"not really from the area.\"   Within the area, residents heap praise on Umma.   \"They're doing the job most of our political people and the police should do,\" said Billy Huston, president of the Committee for a Better and Safer Nostrand Avenue, a civilian patrol in Midwood.   \"Ed and Jim probably have been more responsible for keeping Flatbush together than anyone I know,\" said Larry Jayson, associate director of the Brooklyn Tenants Council.   But with success have come potential pitfalls. As even its proponents are quick to admit, mounting expectations could force the organization either to cut back to preserve its effectiveness -- potentially alienating already disgruntled citizens -- or to concentrate more of its efforts on building a more structured organization. That, they fear, could destroy the activist, grass-roots spirit that has been at the heart of Umma's strength.    Michael Clark, executive director of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a nonprofit organization that assists and trains neighborhood groups, predicted that organizations like Umma will be called on to do more as the city trims back social services. Even though they know they may not have the resources to take on these responsibilities, Umma and other community groups often find it difficult to say no, said Mr. Clark.    Indeed, Mr. Powell and Mr. Burns relish their roles as guardians of the street. Even though they have discontinued regularly scheduled patrols, they still carry walkie-talkies in order to respond on a moment's notice to a call from one of the many patrols their organization has assisted -- although these days, calls for help tend to be less urgent. .   \"It could just be one of the seniors needs someone to go to the store,\" Mr. Powell said.

Let's make $1 be worth no yen.   Think about it. It will solve all our problems. We won't be able to buy anything from Japan, so our $60 billion trade deficit with Tokyo will disappear.

Traditionally book designers have believed that fine bindings were a book's ultimate esthetic virtue and the jacket was mere wrapping and advertising. As late as the 1950's, the American Institute of Graphic Arts refused to exhibit jackets at its annual book show. However, as Steven Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Seymour Chwast, the director of the Pushpin Group, a graphic design company, show in JACKETS REQUIRED (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), \"book jackets emerged as one of America's more vital graphic media and became a proving ground for eccentric design.\" Many of the jackets depicted in the book are creased and torn and look as if they have been moldering on shelves for decades. It is fascinating, and often surprising, to see the original jackets for contemporary favorites like \"A Farewell to Arms\" or \"Of Mice and Men\" or \"Appointment in Samarra,\" but the real standouts are more obscure items like A. H. Bolton's orange and blue design for Maximilian Foster's \"Crooked\" (1927), whose \"art moderne-inspired perspective of skyscrapers evokes the big-city life that comes shattering down on the novel's protagonist.\" It turns out that you can tell a book by its cover, as Mr. Heller and Mr. Chwast demonstrate with Eugene Thurston's jackets for the Mystery League and Alvin Lustig's for New Directions, with a stately, eerily lighted \"Paul Bunyan\" by Rockwell Kent and with such forgotten classics of shading and perspective as the jacket for \"Hacking New York\" (1930), in which \"the quintessential moderne cityscape sets the stage for the tale of a literary cabdriver.\" DAVID WALTON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Bach at Baroque Festival","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/music-bach-at-baroque-festival.html","abstract":"  THE Hoff-Barthelson Music School's 30th yearly Baroque Festival is under way in Scarsdale.

Pete Wilson thinks he can be the fourth. There has been a lot of talk about the micropolitics of his potential candidacy. Will California voters forgive him for running out on a troubled state? Will his G.O.P. colleagues excuse him for turning the executive power over to a Democratic lieutenant governor? Is Mr. Wilson too dull and chilly to appeal to a broader audience? What about polls that show him behind both President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole in his own state?    But the more interesting questions have to do with the threat that Mr. Wilson represents, if he can get rolling, for the other Republican Presidential aspirants and for President Clinton. The general election danger of a California candidate for Mr. Clinton is obvious. He will have a hard time carrying the other two Sun Belt megastates, Texas and Florida. Facing a native-son contest for California's 54 electoral votes would be a big obstacle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/c-corrections-079895.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on page 20 of the Television section today and a listing for Tuesday on page 23, about the new sitcom \"Bringing Up Jack,\" are outdated.

Her sculpture is openly indebted to Cubism and Surrealism, as practiced by Arp and Brancusi. She laid out simple boundaries for her sculptural vision: It was based on the figure in the landscape.

And meandering through the streets of Richmond is like stepping into the pages of a history book, from the neo-Classical domed Capitol designed by Thomas Jefferson to Shockoe Slip, a warehouse district that was ravaged by fire during the Civil War and is now a lively jumble of boutiques and bistros.\n\nRichmond is a city awash in green, from the maple- and oak-lined medians of Monument Avenue -- an elegant, 130-foot-wide boulevard studded with statues of Confederate heroes -- to the petite gardens fringing the Fan district's Victorian brownstones and pastel row houses. On warm Sunday afternoons, flower vendors dot the streets and couples meander through the city's more than 60 parks.\n\nOne of the year's most eagerly awaited events is Historic Garden Week, April 22 to 29, a statewide tour of houses and gardens. In downtown mansions and sprawling suburbs, Richmond's finest private houses welcome more than 4,000 visitors. \nEvents\n\n The Garden Club of Virginia and its 46 member clubs channel proceeds from Garden Week toward the restoration of historic gardens and grounds around the state. Next month's tour marks the 69th year for Historic Garden Week.\n\nOf the 36 tours around the state that are part of Garden Week, three (including the sole evening tour) are based in Richmond. The twilight tour, on April 27 from 6 to 9 P.M., takes visitors inside stylish town houses along downtown Franklin Street, one of the city's fanciest 19th-century addresses. You can view the majestic Jefferson Hotel, reminiscent of the Medici Palace in Florence, from a Victorian carriage and accompany costumed hostesses to a champagne reception at the Bolling Haxall House, an Italianate villa at 211 East Franklin Street. Tickets for each of the three city tours are $15, or $4 a house. They can be bought on site or by calling Garden Week headquarters at (804) 644-7776.\n\nSix 20th-century houses in the city's West End will be featured on the Hampton Gardens tour, on April 25 from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Five of the houses were built in the 1920's and 30's, and all six are open for the first time. The Westhampton tour, April 26, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., showcases seven houses and gardens, including an English cottage garden at 6331 Ridgeway Road in which a rock garden, a shade garden and an arbor are linked by millstone mosaics inlaid with pottery bits and pennies.\n\nFor a change of scenery, drive west for an hour on Interstate 64 to Charlottesville, Thomas Jefferson country. The University of Virginia's porticoed buildings and pavilion gardens were designed by Jefferson and restored by the Garden Club. On April 27, free tours of the Rotunda, gardens and pavilion houses will be conducted from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. At Monticello, three miles southeast of Charlottesville on Route 53, learn about the founding father's passion for gardening at a free tour of the Monticello garden restorations on April 25 and 27 at 2 P.M. Information: (804) 984-9822.\n\nAnother sort of tour -- the Tour duPont, an American version of the Tour de France -- will roll through Richmond on April 28. The 12-day bicycle race, with 18 teams of 7 riders each, declares a winner at the end of each day's race as well as an overall winner at the end. The racers should cross the Richmond finish line, at the intersection of 10th and Cary Streets, on the first of three downtown laps at about 6 P.M. There is a post-race concert in nearby Shockoe Slip Plaza. For more information about this free event, as well as the race, call (804) 782-2777.\n\nShockoe Slip's more permanent residents are the galleries and eclectic craft stores lining its streets and those of Carytown, a nine-block area of quaint shops. Arts in the Park is a show that attracts more than 400 painters, woodworkers, glass blowers and sculptors on May 6 and 7 in Byrd Park. Free admission. Information: (804) 353-8198.\n\nThat same weekend visitors can taste the fruits of the labors of 22 Virginia wineries at the James River Wine Festival. They can sample more than 100 wines, take home a souvenir wine glass, learn the proper way to taste wine and enjoy live jazz for $12 ($10 in advance) on Brown's Island, a grassy isle in the middle of the James River in the heart of Richmond. Contact: (804) 359-4645.\n\nThe wine festival is a prelude to the Taste of Richmond, May 19 to 21, which features the delicacies of more than 30 restaurants. Children (and adults) can step up to the tent that sells sandwiches made from Virginia-produced peanut butters and jellies. Admission to the festival on Brown's Island is $3, and meals range from 50 cents to $3.50. Information: (800) 893-2475.\nSightseeing\n\n Inside the white wooden frame of St. John's Episcopal Church, 2401 East Broad Street, (804) 648-5015, Patrick Henry delivered his legendary incitement to rebellion: \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" Tours ($3, students $1) are given every 30 minutes from 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. daily, except Sunday, when they start at 1. There are re-enactments of Henry's speech to the Second Virginia Convention (Washington and Jefferson attend in bewigged splendor) on Sundays starting Memorial Day weekend.\n\nMaymont, 1700 Hampton Street, (804) 358-7166, a 100-acre Victorian estate, boasts a meticulously decorated mansion that looks out over immaculately groomed lawns and Italian and Japanese gardens teeming with exotic flowers. A children's farm and natural wildlife habitat for bison, elk and black bears is reached from the Spottswood Road entrance. You can ride a tram to see the many sites or take a turn-of-the-century horse-drawn carriage. Admission is free, but a $3 donation is suggested for the house tours (not offered on Mondays). Tram and carriage rides cost $2. The grounds, including the habitat, are open daily from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. \n\nThe wrought-iron gates of Hollywood Cemetery, 412 South Cherry Street, (804) 648-8501, guard the tombs of more than 18,000 Civil War dead, including those of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, and the generals J. E. B. Stuart and George Pickett. Virginia was the birthplace of 7 of the first 12 Presidents. Follow the painted blue line (or buy a map for $1 in the office at the entrance) to Presidents' Circle, where the graves of two of them, James Monroe (1817-1825) and John Tyler (1841-1845) overlook the James River rapids. The cemetery is open Monday to Saturday 7 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.\n\nCivil War buffs will want to visit the Museum of the Confederacy, 1201 East Clay Street, (804) 649-1861, open Monday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., and Sunday noon to 5, $4, to see Gen. Robert E. Lee's Appomattox surrender sword and the adjacent White House of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis's opulent wartime residence. Admission $4.\n\nHistoric Richmond Tours, (804) 780-0107, offers four-hour tours of Civil War battle sites of the Seven Days campaign, including Chickahominy Bluff, Gaines's Mill and Malvern Hill, with a stop at the 1864 Cold Harbor battlefield. Tours take place on the second, third and fourth Sundays of the month, cost $20, $10 for children, and require reservations.\nWhere to Stay\n\n Bensonhouse, 2036 Monument Avenue, (804) 353-6900, fax (804) 342-6027, flanks the tree-lined historic boulevard and has four rooms that range from $85 to $135 for two, including breakfast. The Robinette Suite has a four-poster bed and whirlpool.\n\nPart of the Historic Garden Week tours, Linden Row Inn, 100 East Franklin Street, (800) 348-7424, fax (804) 648-7504, occupies a restored row of Greek Revival town houses. Furnished with period and reproduction pieces, the 71 rooms range from $84 for garden accommodations to $157 for an elegant suite. Prices for a double include a Continental breakfast and nightly wine and cheese receptions. The smaller rooms overlook the courtyard, the \"enchanted garden\" that Edgar Allan Poe, who spent much of his life in Richmond, refers to in his poem \"To Helen.\"\n\nBudget: Five blocks from the Capitol, the Radisson, 555 East Canal Street, (800) 333-3333, (804) 788-0900, fax (804) 788-0791, has 300 rooms, half of which face the city. Ask for one overlooking the James River. Rates for two run from $69 to $129.\n\nThe 211-room Holiday Inn-Historic District, 301 West Franklin Street, (800) 465-4329, (804) 644-9871, fax (804) 344-4380, is clean and functional. The hotel is being renovated; ask for a refurbished double room. Rates are $70 to $80 and include parking, 24-hour shuttle service anywhere within two miles, rooftop pool and passes to the Y.M.C.A. fitness center down the street. \n\nLuxury: The Jefferson Hotel, Franklin and Adams Streets, (800) 424-8014, fax (804) 225-0334, is the epitome of Southern opulence, from the marble-tiled floors to the 70-foot domed ceiling capped by a stained-glass skylight. It is 100 years old this year, and includes a newly opened fitness center. The 274 rooms range from $105 to $95 for two. \nWhere to Eat\n\n The Strawberry Street Cafe, 421 North Strawberry Street, (804) 353-6860, boasts of the \"best burger in town\" ($5.50). The cafe is famous for its bathtub salad bar, a cast-iron clawfoot tub stocked with salads, homemade soup and fresh fruit for $6.95. Dinner for two with a bottle of Virginia wine is about $30.\n\nMamma Zu, 501 South Pine Street, (804) 788-4205, is an Italian restaurant serving huge portions of pasta ($5.95 to $8.95) and various seafood and meat dishes ($9.95 to $14.95). The pizza ($8 for a large one that will feed three) substitutes stewed tomatoes for sauce and is delicious. There always seems to be a wait at dinner, when a meal for two with wine will run $35. No reservations except for groups of six or more. \n\nIn historic Church Hill, Millie's Diner, 2603 East Main Street, (804) 643-5512, serves eclectic ethnic fare. Millie's signature dish is Thai spicy shrimp, with asparagus and shiitake mushrooms over spinach fettucine ($17.95). Lines are always long (no reservations) but move faster at lunch, when sandwiches include one of pesto, roasted red pepper and ricotta ($5.95.). Lunch for two, $20; dinner with wine is $60.\n\nA converted warehouse in the Shockoe Slip area houses the Frog and the Redneck, 1423 East Cary Street. Its nouveau Southern cuisine blends French and American cooking in such dishes as grilled tuna drizzled with parmesan butter sauce ($18.25), accompanied by the restaurant's trademark stone-ground grits. The creme brulee ($4.75) swirls tiny flecks of vanilla bean into rich custard, topped by a shell of caramelized sugar. Dinner for two with wine runs $80. Call (804) 648-3764 for reservations.\n\nNext door is Shockoe Belle, the Frog's lunch counterpart, offering wood-fired pizzas topped with shiitake mushrooms and cured salmon for $7.50. Call (804) 649-2355.\n\nSunday brunch is served at James River Wine Bistro, 1520 West Main Street, (804) 358-4562. For $14.95 you can sit outside on the patio and dine on a buffet of custom-made omelets, Belgian waffles, fresh salads, smoked salmon, hot pastas and desserts, while sipping mimosas or champagne.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"7 Hospitals Join, Woo H.M.O.'s","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/nyregion/7-hospitals-join-woo-hmos.html","abstract":"IN a pioneering effort to maintain their medical prerogatives and profitability in the increasingly competitive era of managed care, seven central New Jersey hospitals have banded together to form the Health Care Network of New Jersey.\n\nWhile each hospital remains independent, the seven and their physician organizations have begun sharing equipment and expertise and developing standardized methods of treatment and a more comprehensive range of medical services.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Creative Zoning for the 'Chateau Country'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/realestate/creative-zoning-for-the-chateau-country.html","abstract":"  A secluded mansion in the heart of this wealthy Brandywine Valley community is undergoing a $1 million conversion to an office building under a recent land-use amendment that allows significant properties to be used as commercial space while retaining residential zoning.

The diseased brain, the mind that is feverishly alert or in a deep perceptual slumber, and the body that struggles to contain them: this is the spectacle that the British director Peter Brook puts before us in his rich and strange theater piece \"The Man Who,\" an adaptation of the neurologist Oliver Sacks's book of case studies \"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.\"   Dr. Sacks likes to call his studies stories or clinical tales, for he sees his patients as figures of myth besieged by powerful forces. \"Classical fables have archetypal figures -- heroes, victims, martyrs, warriors,\" he writes in his book's preface. \"Neurological patients are all of these.\" They are travelers to unimaginable lands who have brought their stories back to civilization, tales as fabulous as anything found in \"The Odyssey,\" \"The Arabian Nights\" or \"The Mahabharata,\" the vast Hindu epic that Mr. Brook staged eight years ago.

Some have suggested that it would be best to take away the art and leave the museum as a monument to its architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. It's true that Wright's design often doesn't display art to excellent advantage. But occasionally a show comes along in which art and architecture reinforce each other, creating the unified experience Wright envisioned. For me, the Guggenheim's current retrospective of paintings by Ross Bleckner is such a show. I found the whole experience very moving, not least because it prompted me to reflect on how a viewer's personal history and emotions effect the response to visual art.   The show dredged up a memory from my adolescence, when I imagined that I faced a choice. It seemed to me that there were people who let themselves feel things, and others who didn't, and I wanted to belong to the first group. Did I really have a choice?

That suggests the decrease in the 1992-93 season was an aberration.

His private musical laboratory isn't cold or sterile. He knows how to make machines sound perky, playful, even cuddly, with little squiggles and tendrils of improvisation poking out of mechanical patterns.

The elder Mr. Parsons was the first to import Japanese maples into the country; he was also the first to propagate rhododendrons, which may explain his son's evident fondness for the shrub.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950326","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/26/realestate/residential-resales-672795.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

The raid -- the largest in the 129-year history of the A.S.P.C.A. -- followed two months of undercover investigations that tracked preparations for an event that had kicked off the 1995 cockfighting season in New York City and brought hundreds of spectators and fighting cocks from all over New York State, as well as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Puerto Rico.

But a friend of Mr. Huang said that the teen-ager did not resist and that the shooting was not accidental. The two starkly different versions emerged as the police and the family struggled to find out what really happened Friday morning in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. One thing both agreed on was that Mr. Huang was carrying a carbon dioxide-powered Grossman Air Pistol, which resembles a real weapon, outside a friend's house. B3.

The Hungarian director Pal Erdoss depicts his heroine in a precise, straightforward style. Juli is a freelance photographer in her late 20's, scrambling to make some money and sort out her private life. Most of the time she lives with her boyfriend, a student named Csaba, in a rented room. Her much-loved 7-year-old son, Peti, lives in an apartment with Juli's mother. Her professional identity is even more scattered, because no one wants her work. In deft scenes, Mr. Erdoss presents Juli's life as both average and filled with complications.

The other is in communicating a message (all hip-hop says something about society, even sex-obsessed songs like \"Baby Got Back\") without being overbearing, underinformed or just plain obnoxious. On Wednesday night during a sold-out performance at Tramps, Digable Planets and Spearhead managed to avoid these problems by playing with competent bands and rapping lyrics that valued form and rhythm as much as content.   Digable Planets were almost too successful in 1993: for the high-brow, their first album, \"Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space),\" was named after a Jorge Luis Borges line. For those after immediate pleasure, the beatnik jazz-style single \"Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)\" had some of the most memorable hooks of the year. But at Tramps, Digable Planets set out to prove that they weren't one-hit wonders. The group's three Brooklyn-based rappers, who perform using the names Doodlebug, Ladybug and Butterfly, performed mostly material from their second album, \"Blowout Comb\" (Pendulum/EMI), which looks to the Black Panthers and black-exploitation films of the past to find calls to revolution for the present. Behind the rappers' laid-back, tag-team poetry of kitsch and resistance, a two-man horn section shaded the music with playing that was more atmospheric than jazzy, and a drummer, guitarist, bassist and keyboardist made sure the insect rappers had a solid foundation to wander over.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950328","headline":"Building New Ballets Out of Restleness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/arts/dance-review-building-new-ballets-out-of-restleness.html","abstract":"  One thing that makes Eliot Feld a valuable choreographer is his restlessness.

The Omnibook 600C from the Hewlett-Packard Company weighs in at just under four pounds, the Digital Equipment Corporation's Hinote Ultra (not to be confused with the larger just plain Hinote) at about four and a quarter pounds and the Thinkpad 701 models from the International Business Machines Corporation at about four and a half pounds. An external power transformer and a floppy disk drive typically add another a pound and a quarter. With eight megabytes of RAM (random access memory), prices for units based on DX2/50 processors start at about $2,900 for the Omnibook, $3,600 for the Hinote and $4,100 for the Thinkpad.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950328","headline":"Impressive Reports, To Stay And to Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/science/peripherals-impressive-reports-to-stay-and-to-go.html","abstract":"  YOU are showing the first-quarter sales surge to the board of directors on the 21-inch monitor of a computer running Microsoft Windows 3.1.
