Stopping the negotiations would perversely reward the very group that triggered the latest cycle of violence -- the radical Lebanese Party of God, whose guerrillas killed seven Israeli soldiers stationed on Lebanese soil earlier this month in a calculated effort to undermine the talks.    With that danger in mind, Damascus has prudently restrained its own forces in Lebanon even though Syrian soldiers have been killed in the fighting. Showing less restraint, Israel is deliberately trying to force tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians to flee northward, in the hope this will somehow pressure Beirut and Damascus to crack down on the Party of God.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930728","headline":"U.S. Grants $4.5 Million to Help Military Contractors Shift Focus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/28/nyregion/us-grants-4.5-million-to-help-military-contractors-shift-focus.html","abstract":"  Gov.

Or, actually, an old one. When the company revives its 1967 Frank Corsaro production tomorrow evening, it will not present the well-worn standard edition. Instead, Christopher Keene will conduct the American premiere of the score as it was performed at its world premiere at La Scala.    That version had only a single performance, on Feb. 17, 1904, and was booed off the stage for a complicated combination of reasons. The audience found its Wagnerian-length acts too long, and objected to the absence of a tenor aria. Some listeners derided the Japanese folk elements, and criticized other sections of the work as warmed-over \"La Boheme.\" And some objected to the brutality and outright nastiness with which Puccini and his librettists, Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica, described this tragic meeting of East and West.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Questions On Signing Up New Voters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/nyregion/questions-on-signing-up-new-voters.html","abstract":"  In an often partisan hearing, State Senate Republicans yesterday sharply questioned the credibility of a former New York City Board of Elections official who now works for Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign and raised concerns about whether duplicate registrations and other irregularities could skew a close race this fall.   At the hearing at the State Office Building in lower Manhattan, Board of Elections officials acknowledged that they had found as many as 22,000 duplicate registrations on file in the city between the time of the Presidential election last fall and this spring, but they said that a random check of 180 of them had found no evidence that any of those registrants had voted twice. They said they were weeding out the duplicates from the three million voters on the rolls. Duplicate Registrations    For years the board has been plagued by administrative problems, and Senator Michael F. Nozzolio of Seneca Falls, the chairman of the Senate's Elections Committee, called the hearing to examine recent reports of sloppy record-keeping and potential irregularities, especially in the wake of big voter registration drives last year. Aides to the Republican-Liberal mayoral nominee, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who lost in 1989 by less than 50,000 votes, have repeatedly claimed there is potential for outright fraud, arguing that duplicate registrations, particularly in heavily black districts, could hurt their candidate this fall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Hentrich: Punt, Pray And Kick","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/sports/pro-football-hentrich-punt-pray-and-kick.html","abstract":"  After a college career at Notre Dame, Craig Hentrich should have no problem punting or kicking before a large crowd and a national television audience.

By that measure, Aguiar ranked third in the American Conference and fifth in the league, with 37.6 yards. Still, there is a perception that Aguiar's job is in jeopardy because of Hentrich's mere presence in camp.

Simmons will have the surgery today to repair torn cartilage he suffered during Monday morning's workout. A test Tuesday revealed the tear. Simmons was the 15th player selected in the draft and had been slotted to start at left outside linebacker.   \"It'll set him back a little bit, certainly,\" Holmgren said. \"But we're talking four to six weeks and he'll be back in there at the beginning of the season.\"   In Simmons's absence, the Packers will start Jeff Brady, a third-year man. A knee injury limited him to 8 games and 18 tackles last year. (AP) San Francisco 49ers    What is a trip to a foreign land for his teammates is a homecoming of sorts for the San Francisco 49ers' offensive tackle James Parrish.   Parrish, a veteran of the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football and now struggling to win a spot on the 49ers, said he was mobbed by young autograph-seekers during an evening walk on the Ramblas, the city's jammed promenade.   \"It's great, I'm just glad to be back in the city and see some of my old friends,\" Parrish said before the 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers scrimmaged at a practice for their American Bowl game in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday.   \"All the guys on the team know I played here and know the city and the people -- and my Spanish is pretty fluent,\" said Parrish, who played for the Dragons before the W.L.A.F. folded after the 1992 season. Parrish was cut last season by San Diego after he spent the 1991 season on Miami's \"physically unable to perform list.\" (AP) Miami Dolphins    At first it looked as if it were just another scuffle during two-a-day drills in Davie, Fla. Hot, tired and suddenly angry, Huey Richardson reached out and grabbed offensive guard Charles Hope's face mask. Then Richardson ripped it off, and the message was clear -- he'll fight to keep his career alive.   Richardson, a former Florida Gators star, is trying to win a job at defensive end with the Miami Dolphins, his fourth team in three years. He was a bust with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who made him the 15th player selected in the 1991 draft. The Washington Redskins and Jets waived him last year. In two seasons, he made seven tackles.   \"I had the opportunity at those other places; they just didn't pan out,\" said Richardson, 25. \"My dad always told me that adversity builds character, so I guess I'm getting a lot of character.\" (AP) Cincinnati Bengals    David Klingler, Cincinnati's starter in his second pro season, says he isn't worried about Jay Schroeder taking his job. Klingler, last year's first-round draft pick, said he welcomes the experience Schroeder and quarterbacks coach Ken Anderson have to offer.   \"If anything, having Jay there takes off the pressure,\" said Klingler, who has played in four N.F.L. games, compared with 100 for Schroeder. \"With Kenny, now you have two guys back there with a lot to offer.\"   Schroeder, once the starter for Washington and the Los Angeles Raiders, played for the 1987 Super Bowl champion Redskins. He came to the Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, signing a two-year contract for up to $3 million, but was told he would be Klingler's backup.   \"In the back of my mind, I'm thinking I could go 16 weeks and not get a shot,\" Schroeder said. \"But I've got to be prepared. That's the only way I can treat it. I've seen it happen for nine years. It's tough to go through a whole season with one quarterback.

The team physician, Dr. Gary Losse, repaired two ligaments and a tendon that Byrd, 32, tore when he apparently caught his cleats in the grass and fell during a non-contact, one-on-one drill Tuesday afternoon.

The cloud follows him with the fidelity of a severely depressed hound dog. It's almost affectionate. Yet the cloud isn't big enough to block out the sun completely, and life lived in the penumbra can sometimes be astonishingly rich.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"A Wise Decision on Steel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/opinion/a-wise-decision-on-steel.html","abstract":"  It's tempting to criticize the decision by the International Trade Commission to eliminate many of the tariffs that protect American steel producers from foreign competition. After all, the Commerce Department had ruled that many foreign suppliers were violating U.S. trade laws by selling at prices that did not cover their costs -- an injustice the tariffs were designed to correct.   But the criticism is off target. The commission's decision is a model of professional discretion. It carefully sifted the data to determine, as U.S. law requires, whether foreign subsidies and price cutting had injured the large, integrated steel mills that brought the complaints. What the commission found was that in many cases the foreign imports weren't the villain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Indian Government Survives Parliament Vote","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/world/indian-government-survives-parliament-vote.html","abstract":"  After three days of vigorous public debate and intense private political bargaining, the Government of Prime Minister P.

Plenty of big names tried, including Sergei Bubka, Kevin Young and Quincy Watts. But it was Jackson who came the closest to winning the car as he won in 12.97 seconds, just 0.05 off the world record of 12.92 set by Roger Kingdom in 1989. Running against a headwind of 1.6 meters a second, the Welshman became only the third man to break the 13-second barrier. He broke his European record of 13.04, set last year in Cologne, Germany. Bubka won the pole vault, clearing 19 feet 1/4 inch. He barely missed at a world-record attempt at 20-1 3/4, hitting the bar with his arms after clearing it with the rest of his body. Young, an American, won the 400 hurdles in 48.20. Watts, another Olympic champion from the United States, won the 400 in 44.13 seconds, the third best time of the year.

Senator Moseley Braun interrupted the questioning of Judge Ginsburg to declare that, as the Senate's only black member, she was \"personally offended\" by Senator Orrin Hatch's theoretical comparison of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford ruling.\n\n Judge Ginsburg, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was endorsed by the Judiciary Committee yesterday, agreed that there was a \"sharp distinction\" between the two cases, characterizing the 1973 ruling as \"affirming the right of the individual to be free\" and the 1857 decision as \"affirming the right of one man to hold another in bondage.\" Liberals, like myself, who support abortion rights should not applaud these pronouncements.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930730","headline":"ResultsPlus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/30/sports/resultsplus-874793.html","abstract":"  TENNIS Pernfors Stuns Courier in Canadian Open  Mikael Pernfors of Sweden, ranked No. 1,001 in the world in March 1991 after knee and tendon injuries virtually halted his game, pulled off a 6-3, 6-2 upset of Jim Courier yesterday in the Canadian Open in Montreal. \"It shows that I can beat the good players when they play bad,\" Pernfors said after dispatching the world's second-ranked player. Courier, 22, in his first tournament since losing the Wimbledon final to Pete Sampras, turned in a lackluster third-round match after defeating a fellow American, Jeff Tarango, in his opening match on Tuesday. \"Everything was wrong,\" Courier said. \"Mikael played very well and let me beat myself.\" Pernfors's upset, a surprise in a tournament that was holding close to form, came in the early afternoon, just before heavy rain forced a short delay in play. Another upset followed the delay, with Todd Martin, seeded 13th, eliminating third-seeded Boris Becker, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3). (AP) Haarhuis Knocks Out Brugera: Paul Haarhuis ousted the top-seeded Sergi Brugera by 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Dutch Open clay court championship in Hilversum, the Netherlands. Brugera, winner of the French Open, was one of four seeded players knocked out in the second round. Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden defeated sixth-seeded Russian Andrei Chesnokov, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2; Carlos Costa of Spain beat No. 7-seeded Fabrice Santoro, 6-2, 6-4, and Richard Fromberg of Australia outlasted the eighth-seeded German, Marc Goellner, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (9-7). (AP) GOLF  Newcomer Takes Lead After First Round  A PGA Tour newcomer, Michael Bradley, shot a bogey-free seven-under-par 64 yesterday for a one-stroke lead after the opening round of the Federal Express-St. Jude Classic in Memphis. The defending champion, Jay Haas, and Davis Love 3d each shot 65's, and Scott Gump, Michael Allen and Neal Lancaster shot 66's. Bradley, who joined the PGA Tour this year and has missed the cut in three of his last five tournaments, got off to a quick start with birdies on the first three holes and four of the first five. Haas won last year with a 21-under-par 263 and tied for third in 1991 over the 7,006-yard Tournament Players Club at Southwind. (AP) Goetze and Johnson Tied: Vicki Goetze, out of college and winner of only $4,934 in her first two events on the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, shot a four-under-par 68 to tie Trish Johnson for the first-round lead in the $450,000 Ping-Welch's Championship in Canton, Mass. Goetz had nine birdies and five bogeys. Johnson, of Wales, had only one bogey and claimed a share of the lead by sinking a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole. Nine golfers, including the Hall of Famer Pat Bradley, were bunched at 69.

Harold Cudmore's One-Ton yacht, Jameson One, owned by the King of Norway, struck a rock and sank 20 yards from the beach a mile west of Cowes.

Senator Moseley Braun interrupted the questioning of Judge Ginsburg to declare that, as the Senate's only black member, she was \"personally offended\" by Senator Orrin Hatch's theoretical comparison of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford ruling.\n\n Judge Ginsburg, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was endorsed by the Judiciary Committee yesterday, agreed that there was a \"sharp distinction\" between the two cases, characterizing the 1973 ruling as \"affirming the right of the individual to be free\" and the 1857 decision as \"affirming the right of one man to hold another in bondage.\" Liberals, like myself, who support abortion rights should not applaud these pronouncements.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930730","headline":"Review/Music; Exultation Sinks Two Hoary Canards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/30/arts/review-music-exultation-sinks-two-hoary-canards.html","abstract":"  One of Hugo Wolf's pithiest criticisms of Brahms, that he could not exult, might also have been leveled at the New York Philharmonic a few years ago.

Although age hasn't dimmed the emotional power of Ray Charles, the great soul singing giant who will turn 63 next month, it has changed his perspective. On his newest album, \"My World\" (Warner Brothers Records), he offers a chortlingly avuncular \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" and a pained but loving \"If I Could,\" a ballad that laments the impossibility of keeping your children from making mistakes. Everything Mr. Charles sings, from Broadway standards to soul classics, comes out sounding spontaneous and of the moment. Show time is tonight at 8, and tickets are $30 and $35. Watch Out!
