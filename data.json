Crow and blue jay, mallard duck and Canada goose; squirrel, cottontail, skunk and white-tailed deer: together they and other seemingly innocuous species are emerging as collective winners in give-no-quarter combat with a much larger number of more sensitive and less adaptable species that include many songbirds and uncommon plants.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940301","headline":"A Jury Judges Waco","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/opinion/a-jury-judges-waco.html","abstract":"  The jury's mixed verdict in the deaths of four of the Treasury agents who raided the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., has dealt another mortifying blow to Federal law enforcement.

Often called folacin or folate (its biologically active form), folic acid is already well established as critically important in preventing spina bifida and anencephaly, both devastating birth defects of the neural tube. A nationwide effort is under way urging women to take supplements containing folic acid and to increase their intake of folate-rich foods, like dark green leafy vegetables, before becoming pregnant as well as during the first months of pregnancy. This is especially important for women who have been taking oral contraceptives, which interfere with the body's use of folic acid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940301","headline":"1944:Victory in Burma : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/opinion/IHT-1944victory-in-burma-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW DELHI - [From our New York edition:] The Allies have scored their first major victory in Burma by destroying a special force of 8,000 Japanese in two weeks of confused fighting in the dusty, choking jungle of the Arakan sector, north of Akyab, the Sou","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940301","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/nyregion/metro-digest-325902.html","abstract":"  NEW YORK CITY  OFF OF WELFARE, BUT AT WHAT COST?

It's tempting to hear \"Death and the Maiden\" as a homage to late Beethoven, to find Schubert's whole conception growing out of Opus 131's elegiac sixth movement and savage finale.

One rarely hears performances that show traces of a separate cultural tradition. Hence the surprise and fascination of Tomohiro Okumura's recital at Alice Tully Hall on Monday night. This young Japanese violinist, the recipient of the 1993 Naumburg Award, played Bartok's First Sonata with a cool, rapt, meditative detachment that put the music in an intriguing new light.   It should be noted first that Mr. Okumura is a player of considerable technical fluency and tonal polish. Bach's Sonata in A, first on the program, promised an evening of refined, restrained musicianship; Saint-Saens's First Sonata, with its dazzling 16th-note cascades, added virtuoso glitter at the end. But the intense molding and shaping of sustained tones in the Bartok sonata alerted one to an unusual temperament. It somehow sounded more Japanese than Toru Takemitsu's tone-picture \"Hika\" (also on the program), without seeming at all unidiomatic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940303","headline":"Our Bomb Bay Doors OpenSomewhere Near Cassino","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/03/opinion/IHT-our-bomb-bay-doors-opensomewhere-near-cassino.html","abstract":"Since none of my children ever asked me \"What did you do in the war, Dad?\" I have decided after 50 years to answer the question anyway: \"I didn't bomb Monte Cassino.\".My big moment came on the morning of Feb. 15, 1944.
