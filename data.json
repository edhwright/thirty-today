By today's supposedly rational standards, it may be grandiose, inefficient, even wasteful; yet it is also comfortably solid, an endearing relic of an era that through the distorting lens of time seems simpler and more emotionally direct.   By the time Korngold composed the suite, in 1930, Schoenberg and his school had already wrung what they considered useful out of the densely chromatic late Romantic style, and were hoping to discover a new world beyond tonality. Korngold, like Richard Strauss, demurred, believing that there was life in tonality yet. Here he used traditional forms -- a prelude and fugue, a lilting Viennese waltz and a set of variations -- as well as freer structures. But the forms did not constrain his imagination: color, sentimentality and even a kind of cinematic drama pour out of the piece.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940117","headline":"Julie C.

He finished ahead of Thomas Sykora, and completed a successful weekend for the Austrian team before the home fans, following Patrick Ortlieb's victory in Saturday's downhill. (AP) Wachter Wins Again: Anita Wachter of Austria scored her third World Cup victory of the season, beating Deborah Compagnoni, a hometown hero, in a giant slalom in Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy. Wachter, the World Cup champion, dominated a highly technical race by clocking the fastest time in both runs down the Olimpia Tofane course. Her total time was 2 minutes 38.80 seconds as Compagnoni finished .73 seconds behind. (AP)   TRACK AND FIELD  Ford Games Showcase  Lyria Martin, a La Guardia High School sophomore, and William Arnold, a Bishop Ford junior, turned in impressive performances yesterday in the Bishop Ford games at the West 168th Street Armory. More than 1,500 boys and girls from 73 Eastern high schools took part in the meet. Martin, the Eastern states outdoor 100-meter champion, won the girls 55-meter dash in 7 seconds flat. Martin's time was 40.5 seconds. Arnold, winner of the mile at Brown University last month in 4 minutes 22.9 seconds, waited until the final turn to pass the leader, Jim Colling, the Virginia state mile champion from Chantilly, to win in 4:25.0. Colling, running his first indoor race this season, was second in 4:26.2. Bruce Rosado, another Ford runner who won the 800 meters at Brown in 1:59.3, kicked down the final straightaway to win the 1,000-meter run in 2:34.8.  HORSE RACING  Diazo a Disappointment  Zignew, a 21-1 long shot, took the lead inside the eighth pole and scored a 1 3/4-length victory yesterday in the $225,500 San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita in Acadia, Calif. Zignew held off the stretch drives of Nonproductiveasset and Pacific Tango for her fifth victory in 12 starts. The winner covered a mile and an eighth in 1:47 4/5 and paid $44.80, $20.60 and $11.60 for $2 across the board. Diazo, the 17-10 favorite with stablemate Stuka, was kept in good position behind pace-setter Bat Eclat during the first mile of the Grade II event for 4-year-olds. That's when Zignew passed Del Mar Dennis and Diazo at the top of the stretch and went on to win the second leg of the Strub Series. Diazo, trained by Bill Shoemaker and ridden by Laffit Pincay, captured the first leg when he won the Malibu Stakes on Dec. 26. He was ninth in the 12-horse field yesterday.

The silent-film star's dreamy, languid gaze appears on screens mounted in a set resembling the lobby of a 1920's movie theater. A voice, ostensibly from an early Victrola, begins to sing in the style of Rudy Vallee, mourning the passing of the screen idol. The pop lyrics are first overlaid with the sound of a male chorus intoning the Latin Requiem, then with the vocalizing of a soprano, and finally, with loving declarations by a woman in black. There are five singing lines going at once in clashing keys and styles.   It is a daring way to open an opera, even for someone as lyrically gifted as Mr. Argento. And for all the awkwardness of the first night's performance of this opening gambit, it was clear that it was meant to suggest momentous grandeur, religious pomp, pop sentimentality and personal devotion, all combined into a contradictory whole. There is somebody of great importance lying in state (or so the music proclaims), whose impact was profound. \"The Dream of Valentino,\" which will be performed until Feb. 13, promises to explain how and why.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940117","headline":"Giuliani Delivers Strong Plea, Seeking to Ease Blacks' Fears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/17/nyregion/giuliani-delivers-strong-plea-seeking-to-ease-blacks-fears.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

Even while he has branched out to become a director of opera and plays by others, his contribution remains instantly identifiable. Whatever he does, he leaves sight and sound tracks as his signature, and his art has always had a deeply intellectual foundation.   In rehearsal at St. Mark's Theater with his new play, \"My Head Was a Sledgehammer,\" Mr. Foreman is at the electronic controls, interjecting suggestions to his actors and orchestrating the mechanics of the enterprise. With a mournful mien that extends from his eyes to his mustache, he is a younger, avant-garde doppelganger of Broadway's David Merrick. As the author fine-tunes the performance, a spiderlike chandelier revolves like a fan in a Singapore hotel; string -- a Foreman trademark -- crisscrosses and stratifies the stage, and Oriental carpets cushion the walls.

Not Yet.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/opinion/trust-assad-not-yet.html","abstract":"After their marathon meeting in Geneva on Sunday, President Clinton was asked if he felt that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had made a firm commitment to normalize relations with Israel. Without hesitation, Mr. Clinton replied, \"The short answer is yes.\"\n Well, maybe. Mr. Assad's record suggests that it is wise to be skeptical about his intentions. As in the bad old days when he was a Soviet client, he still engages in aggressive activities, aimed mostly at Israel, Turkey, Lebanon and the United States. They include the following:\n * Building up Syrian unconventional military capabilities. Damascus now has thousands of chemical warheads, appears to be on the verge of putting anthrax agents into weapons and is starting nuclear research. Its Scud-C missiles from North Korea can reach most of Israel's population.\n * Getting more involved in the drug trade. Top officials participate in trafficking drugs to the West, according to a 1992 Congressional report.\n * Sponsoring Lebanese and Palestinian groups that attack Israelis as well as Palestinians who favor Yasir Arafat, and sponsoring the PKK, a Kurdish Marxist group, in its assaults on Turkey.\n\n* Nurturing an alliance with Iran. So close is this bond, the Syrians have distributed counterfeit U.S. currency produced in Iran, according to a report by the House Republican Research Committee.\n In short, Mr. Assad's policies have made Syria one of the Middle East's rogue states, along with Libya, Iraq and Iran. No less important, Mr. Assad represses his own people with a harshness second only to Saddam Hussein's. But while Washington puts pressure on the other rogue states by working to isolate them, it woos Syria. Rather than isolating the regime, it has tried for years to bring Syria into the \"family of nations.\" Our diplomats hold out small bait to encourage cooperation; last month, for example, we permitted Syria to acquire American-made jets. Secretaries of State and other dignitaries regularly travel to Damascus, and now four U.S. Presidents have met with Mr. Assad.

Presented by Home for Contemporary Theater and Art, Randy Rollison, artistic director; Barbara Busachino, producing director. WITH: Chuck Coggins, Karen Levitas, Thomas Pasley and Lisa Welti.   There actually is no place like home in David Greenspan's \"Son of an Engineer,\" that is to say, home as a fixed institution doesn't exist. The story of a young man who returns to the suburban house of his childhood to discover his parents have \"moved on,\" this labored fable presents the nuclear family as a sinister disappearing act. And when a character turns on the radio, a voice announces, with comically frantic desperation, \"All these people come and go from our lives, and we don't know them anymore.\"   This is not very surprising news. Nor are the devices Mr. Greenspan employs -- a jumble of classic Albee-esque absurdism and imagery drawn from fairy tales, the Bible, Shakespeare, 1950's domestic sit-coms and apocalyptic science fiction -- particularly original.   As a result, \"Son of an Engineer,\" which has received a fairly skeletal production at the Here arts center in SoHo, often feels like a flat-footed, catch-all parody of vintage, symbol-laden avant-garde theater. It is unclear as to just how ironic Mr. Greenspan, who achieved a certain notoriety for his work with the New York Shakespeare Festival, is in his manipulation of this material. But there seems to be an agonizingly personal sense of anomie behind it.   The play's passive hero, identified only as the Killian Boy (Chuck Coggins), finds his old home inhabited by Tom (Thomas Pasley), a shaggy bear with a goofy, Disneyesque voice; Tom's wife, Phoebe (Karin Levitas), who dresses like Donna Reed and speaks with velvety ominousness; and Phoebe's mostly invisible daughter (Lisa Wells).   Directed with a cloudy mix of archness and anguished earnestness by Mr. Greenspan, \"Son of an Engineer\" includes a scene in which the naked son performs fellatio on the monstrously endowed paternal bear, while Phoebe ruefully washes her breasts in a Martian wilderness. It is that sort of evening.

North, a Marine major, is assigned to the National Security Council at the White House.  DECEMBER President Ronald Reagan signs an executive order that authorizes a covert operation by the C.I.A. to support the contras, rebels who are fighting the leftist Government of Nicaragua. The Administration hopes its secret backing will bolster the contras' appearance as an indigenous independent force. 1982  DECEMBER With accounts of U.S. backing leaking out, Congress enacts the Boland Amendment, which bars the use of Federal money to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. 1984  SPRING Major North is assigned as White House contact with the contras. 1985  FEBRUARY Through dummy corporations abroad, Colonel North and two associates -- Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and Albert A. Hakim, an Iranian-American arms dealer -- make the first of six purchases of weapons destined for the contras. The money comes from private contributions, all secret. By keeping the source of the money private, the White House is able to squeeze through a loophole in the Boland Amendment and maintain that this arms supply is legal.  SUMMER News accounts link Colonel North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras. The reports prompt questions from Congress, and Mr. North helps Robert C. McFarlane, the President's national security adviser, prepare a denial.  JULY Israeli Government officials, who long viewed Iran as a counterweight to Iraq and other Arab enemies of Israel, tell Mr. McFarlane that the Iranians want to open a \"political discourse\" with Washington. Although the United States publicly views the Teheran Government as terrorist and has outlawed arms sales to it, this overture soon leads to the first shipment of American weapons to Iran, without legal authorization. The shipment, in turn, brought the release of one of seven Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic militants.  NOV. 19 Colonel North is appointed by Mr. McFarlane to handle logistics for a second arms shipment, of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, to Iran.  1986  APRIL 4 In a memo to John M. Poindexter, who has succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, Colonel North proposes diverting to the contras $12 million of the proceeds from the sale to Iran. The memo, Colonel North will later testify, was intended for President Reagan.  MAY 25 Mr. McFarlane, who has formally left the Government but remains a consultant to the White House, flies secretly to Teheran with Colonel North and other officials, carrying spare parts for missiles.  AUG. 6 Meeting with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel North denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. As he later testified, this was a lie.  OCT. 5 Carrying arms to the contras, a cargo plane is shot down over Nicaragua. Three crewmen are killed, and a fourth, Eugene Hasenfus, is captured by the Nicaraguan Army.  NOV. 22 Justice Department investigators discover in Colonel North's office his April memo proposing the diversion of arms-sale money to the contras. NOV. 23 Colonel North meets privately with Mr. McFarlane and tells him that the diversion was approved by White House superiors. The colonel also meets with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and informs him. NOV. 24 Mr. Meese tells the President of the diversion. NOV. 25 Mr. Meese discloses the Iran-contra connection. Mr. Reagan announces Mr. Poindexter's resignation and Colonel North's dismissal.  1987  JAN. 6-7 Special committees of the Senate and the House are created. FEB. 26A Presidential commission led by former Senator John G. Tower blames the President's top advisers for a chaotic environment that, the commission says, led to the Iran-contra affair. The panel says the President was largely out of touch with the operations of the N.S.C.  JULY 7 Appearing before the Congressional committees, Colonel North begins six days of frequently fervent testimony. He says that he does not know if Mr. Reagan was aware of the diversion of arms-sales money to the contras but that William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, had approved it. Mr. Casey had recently died. NOV. 18 The Congressional committees conclude that the President failed to meet his constitutional mandate to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" The committees say that he bears \"ultimate responsibility.  1988  MARCH 11 Mr. McFarlane pleads guilty to four misdemeanor counts of withholding from Congress information about the Administration's efforts to help the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of community service.  MARCH 16 A Federal grand jury indicts Colonel North, Mr. Poindexter, Mr. Secord and Mr. Hakim on an array of charges, among them conspiracy to defraud the Government by providing the contras with funds from Iran.  MARCH 18 Colonel North resigns from the Marine Corps.  1989  JAN. 5 The defense's demands for classified Government documents, and the Government's refusal to provide them, lead to the dropping of two central counts against Mr. North.  MAY 4 Mr. North is convicted of obstructing Congress, destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. He is acquitted of nine counts.  JULY 25 The continuing battle over classified documents leads to the dropping of two of the most serious charges against Mr. Poindexter. NOV. 8 Mr. Secord pleads guilty to one count of making a false statement to Congress. The plea resolves all charges against him.  1990  APRIL 7 Mr. Poindexter is convicted of conspiracy to mislead Congress, obstructing Congressional inquiries and making false statements. JULY 20 A Federal appeals court sets aside the North conviction, ruling that the case may have been tainted by the testimony that Mr. North, under a grant of immunity, had given to the Congressional committees.  1991  JULY 9 Alan D. Fiers, former head of the C.I.A.'s Latin America task force, pleads guilty of withholding from Congress information about the arms-money diversion. He is later sentenced to a year's probation and 100 hours of community service. SEPT. 6 Clair E. George, former chief of covert operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. OCT. 7Elliott L. Abrams, former Assistant Secretary of State, pleads guilty of withholding information from Congress about efforts to aid the contras. He is later sentenced to two years' probation and 100 hours of service.  NOV. 26 Duane R. Clarridge, former chief of operations for the C.I.A., is indicted on perjury charges. 1992  JUNE 16 Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger is indicted on charges of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the Iran-contra affair. DEC. 9 After one trial in which the jury deadlocked, Mr. George is convicted of lying to Congress. DEC. 24 President George Bush pardons Messrs. Weinberger, McFarlane, Abrams, George, Clarridge and Fiers.  1994  JAN. 18 Seven years after he began his inquiry, Lawrence E.

Such a takeover, which the Governor first proposed two years ago, could save New York City an estimated $130 million this year, by far the largest single item toward reducing the city's projected $2.3 billion budget gap. And though the city would receive a modest increase in aid over last year under the Governor's plan, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W.

Mario M. Cuomo proposed today what he described as a pro-business budget that would cut an array of business taxes, provide modest increases for education and anti-crime efforts and establish new restrictions on health-care services for the poor.   The budget is Mr. Cuomo's least painful in five years, calling for only 160 layoffs in the state's 151,000-member work force, no major service reductions and small increases for programs that faced severe cuts in recent years, including the arts and libraries. Under the proposal, the $33.4 billion general fund budget for the fiscal year starting on April 1 would grow by 3.8 percent, the first time in six years that it would grow faster than the rate of inflation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940119","time":"1994-01-19
