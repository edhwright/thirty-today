Only a few years ago, audiences and judges at the nation's major showcase for independent films embraced arty, esoteric movies and snubbed those dreaded Hollywood-style products. But the increasing influx of the Hollywood crowd -- coupled with changing styles of film makers -- was evident on Saturday night when audience awards were presented to films that are -- let's face it -- mainstream.   \"El Mariachi,\" a comedy-drama by Richard Rodriguez, a 24-year-old Texas film maker, won the Audience Award for a feature film, which is given on a vote by the festival's 5,000 filmgoers and is a good gauge of a film's commercial prospects. The film, about a mariachi musician who enters a Mexican border town at the same time as a hit man, was made by Mr. Rodriguez and his friends for only $7,000. Initially made as a quickie for the Spanish-language video market, it is about as arty as \"Lethal Weapon.\" But much funnier.   (Not as funny, and overlooked in the awards, but still the most talked about film, was \"Boxing Helena,\" about obsessive love gone haywire. Audiences reacted in two ways: they loved it or they hated it.)   Mr. Rodriguez, an engaging, coolly confident film maker whose movie is to be released by Columbia Pictures in January, said on Saturday night, \"I just hope this inspires people to make their own movies, no matter who they are, no matter how rich or poor.\" A Winning Documentary    The Audience Award for a documentary was given to \"Something Within Me,\" an affectionate portrait of St. Augustine's School of the Arts in the South Bronx. This unusual elementary school uses music and other forms of artistic expression to nurture a sense of responsibility and pride among its poor, minority students. The movie won two other awards: the Film Makers Trophy and a Special Jury Award for Merit.   The documentary's producer, Jerret Engle, a former editor at the Dutton publishing house, initially heard about the school on the evening news in New York City about five years ago. Since then, she has worked at part-time jobs and spent years raising $250,000 to make the film.   \"I'm just floored,\" she said on Saturday night. \"I love these kids and their teachers, but I didn't know anyone else would be interested.\" The film, set for a modest commercial release, has already drawn the interest of the Public Broadcasting Service and Home Box Office. Four Grand Prizes    In presenting the awards, the audience was somewhat out of sync with the more traditional Sundance jury. The panel split the Grand Jury prizes among two dramas and two documentaries.   The dramas are \"Ruby in Paradise,\" Victor Nunez's rambling film about a young woman who flees her Tennessee town to find her sense of self on the Florida coast, and Bryan J. Singer's \"Public Access.\" The latter is about a slick, slightly eerie newcomer to a fictional Midwestern town, Brewster, who takes over the public-access cable network and asks the question: \"What's wrong with Brewster?\" The result is nothing less than paranoia.   The jury's documentary awards were given to two powerful works: \"Children of Fate: Life and Death in a Sicilian Family,\" a heart-wrenching portrait of three generations of a Sicilian family, and \"Silverlake Life: The View From Here,\" a harrowing film about AIDS.   (Other prize-winners included Steve Gomer's \"Fly By Night,\" a drama about New York rappers; Tony Chan's \"Combination Platter,\" about illegal Chinese immigrants; Everett Lewis's \"Ambush of Ghosts,\" about a dysfunctional family; Leslie Harris's \"Just Another Girl on the IRT,\" about a black Brooklyn teen-ager, and \"Lillian,\" about the struggles of a black woman. A documentary prize also went to \"Earth and the American Dream,\" about the destruction of the nation's environment).   \"Silverlake Life\" traces the final journey of a film teacher, Tom Joslin, and his companion of 22 years, Mark Maasi, both of whom had AIDS. The two men lived in the Silverlake area of Los Angeles, and both videotaped the film themselves. The graphic film, which includes a hard-to-watch death scene, was completed by a friend, Peter Friedman, a documentary director.   Mr. Friedman, 34, a former student of Mr. Joslin's at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., said he culled 40 hours of videotapes to produce the 99-minute film. \"It is a direct and a difficult film which shows the realities of day-to-day life with AIDS,\" Mr. Friedman said after the awards. \"The whole spirit of the film is to confront the pain and the love shared by these two men.\" In recent days, he said, television and theatrical distributors have expressed interest in the documentary. A Few Words From the Founder    Sundance is plainly going a bit Hollywood; at least six agents from United Talent Agency, one of the festival's numerous sponsors and more aggressive agencies, were seeking new clients. Still, the awards ceremony hardly resembled the Oscars.   Robert Redford, the founder of the festival, was welcomed onstage with applause and whistles. He wore boots, jeans, a leather jacket and a striped sweat shirt.   Mr. Redford, one of the few millionaire movie stars who have actually paid back the industry by nurturing new film makers, told the packed crowd in a converted basketball gym in this ski resort town: \"Nobody can understand the blood, the sweat, the dedication it takes to make these films. Nobody can understand that except the film maker.\"   He said the festival stands for \"innovation, for the avant-garde.\" But other film makers and executives say it was virtually unavoidable for Sundance to turn, unwittingly, into a hunting ground for Hollywood. In many ways, Hollywood is less interested in the films shown here -- which often flounder at the box office -- than in new film makers with commercial potential.   \"It really is a festival of agents,\" said Jonathan Dana, the president of Triton Pictures, an independent film company, who has been visiting the festival for several years. \"It's a barter economy. Everyone's trading information. But it's a tricky conversion from the narrow world of independent films to the market place.\"   Mr. Dana speaks from personal experience. Last year, Triton bought two of the big prize-winners at Sundance: the comedy, \"In the Soup,\" whose star, Seymour Cassel, was master of ceremonies at this year's awards, and the documentary \"A Brief History of Time.\"   Mr. Dana, standing outside a movie theater in Park City, said simply, \"One worked; one didn't.\"   Like another big favorite last year, \"The Waterdance,\" \"In the Soup\" failed at the box office. But \"A Brief History\" succeeded. Mr. Dana shrugged and voiced the oft-heard Hollywood complaint: \"Who knows what works?\" 'Orlando' and 'Helena'    Curiously, the two pictures that were most widely discussed at Sundance went unmentioned last night.   One of them, \"Orlando,\" an adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel by an English film maker, Sally Potter, had its United States premiere at the festival but was not in competition for prizes. (The festival divides films into two major categories, those in competition and those having premieres.) By virtual consensus, \"Orlando\" was the most dazzling film at the festival.   And then there was \"Boxing Helena.\"   No film at the festival provoked as much rage, hisses, applause and debate as this one. The film was directed and written by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, the daughter of David Lynch. Even before it was shown here, the movie created an unusual amount of talk because of the last-minute withdrawals of Madonna and then Kim Basinger from the lead role. Helena is now played by Sherilyn Fenn.   The film deals with a lunatic surgeon (Julian Sands) obsessed by an elusive, beautiful woman named Helena. To keep her, he transforms her into his own Venus de Milo by cutting off her arms and legs and placing her on a pedestal. Hard to believe, but the film is a comedy, albeit very dark.   Ms. Lynch, like many of the twentysomething directors here, is a very confident, assured film maker, without a hint of self-doubt.   Sipping coffee and chain-smoking the other morning in a hotel dining room, Ms. Lynch said she was startled by the almost violent reaction to her film. The film has been called anti-feminist, anti-male and exploitative.   \"People want the film abolished,\" she said. \"They scream at us. I wish they would talk to me. I want to hear them. They don't want to have a discussion. They just get up and leave.\"   Ms. Lynch, who never went to college, grew up in Los Angeles and attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Mich. Upon graduation, she said, she went on a \"fairly extensive hike with my boyfriend,\" lived in Baltimore for several months, and then moved to Los Angeles at 19 to work for her father and write the movie. She's now 24. The movie is awaiting a distributor in the United States   \"My whole intent was to parody and to show seriously what we do to each other in relationships,\" she said. \"It's about how we try to change each other. We are equally vulnerable to self-hatred, to obsession, and we try and change each other. It's about how we try to break each other down and control each other -- the thievery that goes on in obsessive relationships.\"   Although other film makers here find it hard to believe, Ms. Lynch said being her father's daughter was not a blessing.   \"Believe me, people wanted nothing to do with me,\" she said. \"I was 19; it was a risky script; I was some big director's daughter and female. There's something about being a daughter. You would think it gives you some credibility. It doesn't.\"   At least, Ms. Lynch had no trouble getting through the doors of agents and executives. A Long Island Story    At the other end of the spectrum is Rob Weiss, 26, whose father, Carl, runs a touring business for gamblers in Cedarhurst, L.I. To raise money for his son's film, \"Amongst Friends,\" which turned out to be one of the strongest at the festival, Mr. Weiss sent out letters to his customers.   Rob Weiss, who wears his cap backwards and speaks with an unmistakable New York accent, said: \"My dad's friends are pretty much high rollers. The letter wasn't done in a schlock manner. It was classy. It said, like: 'Hey, if you're going to bet on ball games your entire life, if you're going to bet on horses, do something good with the money for a change. Bet it on the kid.\"   The bet on the kid seems to be paying off.   The movie is a gritty exploration of a group of wealthy high-school graduates, most of them Jewish or Italian, from the Five Towns of Long Island who drift into boredom, drugs, petty crime and tragedy. The director, who grew up on Long Island and attended the Parsons School of Design for about a year, said this was the world in which he grew up. Mr. Weiss said he owed a great deal to the works of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone. He said he had seen Phillip Kaufman's \"Wanderers,\" about 40 times. (Mr. Kaufman was honored at this year's Sundance Film Festival.)   Mr. Weiss now has an agent, a lawyer, a manager and a publicity agent. Studios are beckoning. But he's not going Hollywood, he insisted. \"You've got to know where you came from,\" he said. \"I live in South-Central L.A., by U.S.C., with my girlfriend. The neighborhood is predominantly African-American and Mexican. It's reality. That's what I want. That's what I need. Nothing's going to change.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930201","headline":"A River Runs Through Courier's Victory in Australia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/sports/tennis-a-river-runs-through-courier-s-victory-in-australia.html","abstract":"  Jim Courier was running for the river, running toward a repeat of last year's victory swim with his coach and high-energy soulmate, Brad Stine.

But traditions build themselves, inevitably, through formal repetition and paternal influence. Today's bands bear traces of the Stones, Led Zeppelin or the Clash, because those groups created the family language. To escape their parents, today's rockers have to run a very long way from home. Or they can redecorate the old haunts in colors meant to disturb and dislocate their esthetic elders.   Two groups who played at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night took this approach. The evening's headliner, Ween, wrings the neck of rock's power-tripping machismo by playing arena anthems without the arena or even a full band. The pseudonymous duo of Dean and Gene Ween writes memorable pop tunes and play and sings them with verve and skill. But with nothing but a bank of tapes supporting Dean's lone guitar and Gene's metal-playboy vocals, the group's mock pomposity constantly collapses back upon itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930201","headline":"1 Messier Out, 1 Messier Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/sports/hockey-1-messier-out-1-messier-up.html","abstract":"  The Rangers don't know if Mark Messier's injured wrist will be recovered enough for him to play against the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum tonight.

But Luciano Berio has chosen a peculiar relationship to tradition, as could be heard on Friday night, when Dennis Russell Davies led the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in an impressively played concert devoted to Mr. Berio's music. The concert, which was repeated on Saturday night, suggested how much Mr. Berio's avant-garde stance, during more than three decades of composition, has involved wrestling with the past, both in rejecting it and in absorbing it.    Often, the past is something definitely to avoid. Mr. Berio was attracted to the experimental music of the 1950's and was a pioneer of electronic music. Then he produced works like \"Sinfonia,\" whose subject was the countercultural politics of the 1960s. He pushed solo instruments to their limits in a series of numbered works, each titled \"Sequenza,\" and has combined rigorous musical construction with dramatic textual settings. Mr. Berio, who has taught at Juilliard and has been an influential participant in Ircam, Pierre Boulez's research institute for new music in Paris, has written music that is aggressive, distinctive and difficult to like. He has often gone out of his way to write in a perpetual present rather than a traditional past, his eyes focused on \"advanced\" technique.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930201","headline":"Iran's Leader Challenges U.S. And Talks of Re-election Bid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/01/world/iran-s-leader-challenges-us-and-talks-of-re-election-bid.html","abstract":"  President Hashemi Rafsanjani confirmed today that he was ready to run for a second term in June and warned the Clinton Administration in unusually dismissive terms that it was up to Washington to improve relations with his country.

Mr. Brown was on it, face down and fully clothed, atop a woman in a leotard whose high heels waved in the air; then they rolled over so the woman could writhe astride the singer. It was only one of the bump-and-grinds in a quadruple-bill concert devoted to come-ons and boasts of prowess. The aptly titled \"Humpin' Around the World\" tour includes Mr. Brown, the Jamaican dancehall rapper Shabba Ranks, the three-woman pop hip-hop group T.L.C. and the singer Mary J. Blige.   The directness of hip-hop has shaken up the way songs talk about sex. Suave double-entendres are now jostled by single-entendres, and onstage, performers like Mr. Brown act out blunt connotations of lines like \"I will not stop/Till I know you're hot.\" Perhaps in the era of AIDS, freewheeling sex has become one more fantasy to be acted out by pop stars. But before Mr. Brown climbed into his elevator bed, he announced that he was using \"protection.\" Hip-hop has also redrawn old sex roles with new wardrobes but surprisingly little change: men conquer and brag, and women acquiesce while they look for \"real love.\" \"T.L.C. stands up for the ladies,\" a member announced, but then the group sang \"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930202","headline":"United Nations:A Poor Job in Cambodia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/02/opinion/IHT-united-nationsa-poor-job-in-cambodia.html","abstract":"- A precarious peace in Cambodia, maintained by a large-scale international military contingent under United Nations command, appears on the verge of collapse.

The bottom line, though, is that it is virtually impossible to walk away from one of Mr. Goode's recitals without the sense of having gained some new insight, subtle or otherwise, into the works he played or about pianism itself.   Listening to Mr. Goode play the first of two Beethoven-and-Schubert recitals on Sunday evening (the second is on Feb. 14) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one was reminded alternately of Artur Schnabel and Glenn Gould, although his playing really resembles neither. The Gould comparison is in the physicality of Mr. Goode's playing.

The structural recession is characterized by a reversal of the usual cause-effect sequence. Layoffs, especially at high wage levels, are its main source rather than its result.   The two recessions interact: a cyclical downswing in 1990, combined with drastic cuts in defense spending and with growing global competition, have acted as catalysts to accelerate the restructurings of the workplace.

The common-sense measure's nickname describes its core provision: States would be required to permit voter registration when people obtain or renew a driver's license. The law would also require that states offer registration by mail and at unemployment, welfare and other government offices. Those states that already have well-structured \"motor-voter\" programs posted significantly higher voter registration and voter turnout rates in the 1992 election.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930203","headline":"Personal Health","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/03/education/personal-health-223993.html","abstract":"  A SIX-PAGE letter arrived last month that aroused first outrage, then sadness and prompted this public response.

It was introduced at the 1990 world championships, and gives a prize for overall performance in a series of minor games at a tournament. This is now being tried in American tournaments, and the Continuous winner at the Tri-State Regional Championship last month was Joan Dziekanski of Manhattan, who works at the Beverly Club.   On the diagramed deal she held the East cards, with her husband, Paul Dziekanski, in the West position. Her opponents bid themselves to one no-trump when outnumbered in high-card points, a risky thing to do when vulnerable.   A heart lead to the ten was won by the queen, and South led the spade nine. West made a good play by putting up the jack, leaving South to wonder about the location of the queen. South might have won with the king, in the hope of scoring five tricks in the suit, but made the right decision by ducking.   West cashed the diamond ace, looking for a clue, and was not sure about the meaning of his partner's four. He tried the club nine, and East took the ace and returned a heart. West took two heart tricks and now worked out that his partner held diamonds. He shifted back to diamonds, and the defense took eight tricks without South's having to judge what to do in spades.   The moral is that light third-hand opening bids are risky when vulnerable. Most experts would choose to open with the North hand, but if they fail to find a spade fit they can expect to suffer the same fate as North-South did: minus 200, the kiss of death in matchpoint play.
