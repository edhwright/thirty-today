The rise continues a trend that is increasingly seen as a threat to the country's economic health.   The department now estimates the health-care bill for last year at $838.5 billion while it says health spending will total $939.9 billion this year. That would be an increase of 12 percent from last year's total, and the department said that medical spending would continue to go up 12 percent to 15 percent a year over the next five years \"unless significant changes in the health-care system occur.\" By contrast the population growth for last year has been estimated at about 1.2 percent by the Census Bureau.  Adding to Business Costs    The latest projections are higher than those offered by the Commerce Department in December 1991, when it said health spending would rise 12 percent to 13 percent a year in the coming five years. If the new projections are accurate, health spending will easily exceed $1 trillion in 1994.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930105","headline":"No Victory in Debut But All Is Not Lost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/sports/hockey-no-victory-in-debut-but-all-is-not-lost.html","abstract":"  Ron Smith's debut as coach of the Rangers last night wasn't quite as successful as management had in mind when it put him in place of Roger Neilson earlier in the day.

In a speech that served to lay the groundwork for his re-election campaign, the Mayor defended his record, saying he had delivered on his 1989 campaign promises to be tough on crime and to be a sound fiscal steward.

Today I want to talk about how we have heard the voices of this city and how we have kept the promises that we have made. Our compact was based on my vision of what this city can be. It is a vision of a government brought closer to the people and their neighborhoods, for throughout my life I have known New York as a community of neighborhoods. We took our first step toward this vision with our Safe Street, Safe City community policing plan. But we didn't stop there.   Using the talents of some of the most creative thinkers in government we put together a series of programs that put our people up front and moved the bureaucracy behind. We promised a government closer to the people and we have kept that promise. New York has been described as an extraordinary hive of the imagination, the greatest house ever built. I believe that the role of government is to help shape this extraordinary house of ours while giving our people the resources they need in order to take control of their lives. It means giving our children, to whom I've dedicated this administration, the love and nurturing they need to take us into the future.   I knew that our city of neighborhoods would flourish and that our children would thrive if we could create a safe city, a compassionate city, a city with a world-class economy. That is the vision I want to present to you today. So I come before you filled both with pride and determination, proud that we have laid the foundation to insure that our city's economy remains world class and poised to take us into the next century, proud that New York is safer today than it was before and proud of course, that all the while we never lost our compassion and our commitment to make life better for all of our residents.   We've done much -- thank you -- we've done much and we're determined to do much much more with your help. Last July we saw the man who would become the nation's President nominated under the dome of our own Madison Square Garden. Bill Clinton and Al Gore represent the kind of change this country needs and wants. And we are already seeing the prospect of a very different kind of government in Washington, D.C.    I had the privilege of addressing the Democratic National Convention, speaking on behalf of New York as well as the other great cities of our nation. At that point of our first term I could think only about the changes that we had begun to see, of how far we had already come and how much further our vision would carry this great house we have built together. Think back to January of 1990. Crime soared out of control, the budget we inherited had more holes than a Swiss cheese, a recession stole our jobs, an indifferent Federal Government took away our hope. Think about how much has changed. Remember how the words financial control board once dominated discussions of our budget.    Today, thanks to our spirit of reform and renaissance that has been reinventing government for the last three years, the foundation of our fiscal house stands solid.    Of course, while this year's budget is balanced, substantial deficits to remain in the years to come and our next budget will require us once again to make tough decisions, the kind of decisions that define this administration. While the aftershocks of a recession and the forecasts of deficits will require us to remain ever vigilant, surely we will leave our fiscal house standing stronger than we found it. Remember how the threat of businesses leaving our city once seemed to plague us. Over the last three years we've saved over 35,000 jobs by aggressively pursuing established and cutting-edge companies and convincing them to stay in New York.                      . . .         This year we have a new partner. The most important new partner we've gained in a dozen years. We know that the New York State Congressional delegation led by Congressman Charles Rangel will work closely with Speaker Tom Foley and they will continue to hear our voices, so too, will the new head of the powerful Senate Finance Committee Daniel Patrick Moynihan. For too long, however, so many of our efforts had been stymied by the hostile Federal administration. But not only does our new President believe in cities and understand their importance, Bill Clinton knows that New York is the incubator for some of the greatest talent in the country. That's why he's chosen New Yorkers like Bob Ruben and Donna Shalala and Roger Altman and Cliff Wharton and Ron Brown as part of his team to put people first. And also joining that team are former Mayors Henry Cisneros and Fredrico Pena who are committed to urban centers as much as anybody I know. With these new partners, so many of them longtime friends, we can help transform cities like New York into towns called hope.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930105","headline":"It Worked for Japan, It Can Work Under Clinton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/opinion/IHT-it-worked-for-japan-it-can-work-under-clinton.html","abstract":"- Unless the United States enhances its economic structures and regains international competitiveness under Bill Clinton's leadership, the weakening of the U.S. economy will continue to have serious political, economic and security ramifications for the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930105","headline":"Purge Enforced, El Salvador Says","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/world/purge-enforced-el-salvador-says.html","abstract":"  Seeking to dispel assertions that it is violating the peace accords, the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani said today that it had issued a confidential order carrying out the promised purge of the Salvadoran Army for human rights abuses.

But now, with greatly improved technology, investigators are finding that 10, 20, even 30 percent of white blood cells may harbor the virus. And other cells are also turning out to be infected.

About 500 demonstrators, organized by Greenpeace International and other anti-nuclear groups, jeered from the shore and from small motorboats off the harbor, but a fleet of circling helicopters, hundreds of riot police officers and a flotilla of dozens of guard ships brought the ship in at dawn this morning without incident.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930105","headline":"Lonnie Smith to Pirates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/sports/sports-people-baseball-lonnie-smith-to-pirates.html","abstract":"  The Pittsburgh Pirates apparently believe that if they can't beat Atlanta, some former Braves should join them.

The Justice Department was so reluctant to go to trial that it caved in to Rockwell's main goals in negotiations over a plea agreement, the Congressional investigators assert in a report. Most important, the company refused to plead guilty to any charge that implied that toxic or radioactive materials had escaped from the site, the report says. This would have left Rockwell vulnerable to civil suits by neighbors of the plant, which is in the northwest suburbs of Denver. Lobbying by Energy Dept.

On Friday night, Anna Tomowa-Sintow sang Tosca for the first time at the Met; her performance cannot be counted a success. The role requires a reserve of power that Ms. Tomowa-Sintow no longer seems to have available. She barely got to the end of \"Vissi d'arte,\" producing a weak and colorless tone. Her acting, uneventful most of the evening, became distractingly peculiar at the end: she shrieked in horror a moment before, rather than after, shaking Cavaradossi's body, then ran up the stairs to the parapet well before her pursuers appeared on stage. If Tosca had such psychic powers, she would not have got herself into this whole mess.   The other singers did better. James Morris produced a powerful and slyly nuanced Scarpia, managing to hold his own amid the mayhem of Franco Zeffirelli's first-act staging. The all-important words \"Va, Tosca\" were not spat out as usual but enunciated with dandyish precision. The opera works better if Scarpia is something more than a brutal madman. Lando Bartolini made for a loud and stiff Cavaradossi, not at all subtle but a marked improvement over the dramatically inept Luciano Pavarotti who sang earlier in the season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930105","headline":"Democrats Retreat on Expanding Votes of 5 Delegates to the House","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/05/us/democrats-retreat-on-expanding-votes-of-5-delegates-to-the-house.html","abstract":"  On the day before the 103d Congress convenes, House Democratic leaders today watered down a contentious proposal to grant enhanced voting powers to the five delegates representing the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and three territories.

On Sunday night, a Coptic church was burned in Dairut, where Copts make up 20 percent of the population. In Cairo, security officials said that a police car had been burned in suburb of Imbaba, which has been under heavy police surveillance since early last month.

The 1959 movie \"Suddenly, Last Summer,\" starring Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift, was an adaptation by Gore Vidal.    Now played by Maggie Smith with her customary steely authority, the wealthy Violet Venable lives in New Orleans, devoted to her dense tropical garden. She wants a young psychiatrist called Dr. Sugar (Rob Lowe) to perform a lobotomy on her niece, Catharine Holly (Natasha Richardson). The previous summer, Catharine had been traveling with Mrs. Venable's poet son, Sebastian, when he died mysteriously in Spain. Ever since, according to Mrs. Venable, Catherine has been babbling horrible lies about Sebastian. Obviously, the poor creature must be insane, says Mrs. Venable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930106","headline":"Judge Decides to Put Deadline on Deadlock","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/06/sports/football-judge-decides-to-put-deadline-on-deadlock.html","abstract":"  United States District Judge David Doty monitored six hours of negotiations today between representatives of the National Football League's owners and players and told both sides that if they did not settle their five-year-old labor dispute on Wednesday he would rule on the motions before his court.

While Mr. Brown cited a Commerce Department letter stating that he was complying with Federal law, he is disqualifying himself from fewer decisions than Bush Administration appointees to comparable positions like Carla A. Hills, who is also a Washington lawyer. Citing Valuable Experience    Mr. Brown said that his legal work for the Government of Haiti, Japanese electronics companies and other clients had given him valuable experience for dealing with trade policy and other issues as Commerce Secretary. Mr. Brown said that American industry needed a strong advocate and that his experience as a lawyer had fully prepared him for that role.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930107","headline":"Review/Ballet; Return to Repertory With 2 Standards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/arts/review-ballet-return-to-repertory-with-2-standards.html","abstract":"  \"The Nutcracker\" is no more.

Mr. Milosevic has convinced the negotiators that the peace process would be harmed if the West took military action or provided arms to the Bosnians.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930107","headline":"Council Bill Permits Bias Awards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/nyregion/council-bill-permits-bias-awards.html","abstract":"  The New York City Council passed a measure yesterday that would allow victims of bias-motivated violence or harassment to sue in state court for punitive damages.

Oil gushed out as waves battered the ship. And officials said they feared that another fierce storm forecast to move through the area tonight could bring heavy seas that would break the vessel apart, dumping the rest of the oil into the water.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930107","headline":"Dizzy Gillespie, Who Sounded Some of Modern Jazz's Earliest Notes, Dies at 75","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/arts/dizzy-gillespie-who-sounded-some-of-modern-jazz-s-earliest-notes-dies-at-75.html","abstract":"  Dizzy Gillespie, the trumpet player whose role as a founding father of modern jazz made him a major figure in 20th-century American music and whose signature moon cheeks and bent trumpet made him one of the world's most instantly recognizable figures, died yesterday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J.
