Victor Herbert's Second Cello Concerto and Samuel Barber's Second Essay for Orchestra had their world premieres at Philharmonic concerts in 1894 and 1942, and the orchestra gave Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique its first American performance in 1866, 36 years after its world premiere in Paris.    James DePreist conducted the orchestra with mixed but generally pleasing results. His account of the Barber, though on the brisk side, was a picture of lucidity. Details that are usually obscured -- fleeting brass effects, inner wind lines -- were spotlighted without being given an unnatural prominence. And the solo woodwind lines that weave through the essay, and also the Berlioz, were shapely and characterful and did double duty in elucidating the essay's charms and reminding listeners of one of the Philharmonic's strengths.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930610","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/style/chronicle-756693.html","abstract":"  It takes a measure of flexibility to cater a dinner for 1,200 people.

Sting was smart to return to mid-size theaters like the 5,605-seat Paramount for his current tour (although he's also opening some stadium shows for the Grateful Dead), because the music he's making now moves too fast and too subtly for most arena concerts. He writes and sings pop songs, but in concert they're laced with jazzy improvisation, transforming them between the lines of catchy choruses and rolling grooves. For all of Sting's associations with causes, and the earnest moping of many of his lyrics, he has rarely been a preachy performer in concert. And on Tuesday, Sting the musician was triumphant.   While Sting's bands, including the Police, have never been content to play songs by rote, his current group takes on all challenges, from odd meters and harmonic substitutions to the openness and understatement of a ballad. Sting's own bass was both foundation and fulcrum for a nimble four-piece band including Dominic Miller on guitar, David Sancious on keyboards and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums. They don't have the jazz pedigrees of his first post-Police group, but they mesh gleefully and they know which gambits belong where.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930610","headline":"Japan Is Represented by an Artist It Once Rejected","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/10/arts/japan-is-represented-by-an-artist-it-once-rejected.html","abstract":"  The last time Yayoi Kusama displayed her art at the Venice Biennale was 1966.

If Mr. Roche's design for the Jewish Museum's new expansion brings to mind Goethe's standard formula for critical appraisal, that may be because the design itself is somewhat formulaic. It is an appealing formula, and Mr. Roche carries it off with devotion and skill. The building does not lack conviction. But it does lack depth.   This Sunday's long-awaited reopening of the museum after two and a half years of renovations brings to fulfillment an ambitious plan, conceived in 1989, to give the Jewish Museum a home worthy of its mission. With a permanent collection of more than 27,000 objects -- ranging from archeological artifacts to contemporary paintings -- this is the major American museum devoted to Jewish culture and history. The museum has grown in stages since its founding in 1904, when it was provisionally housed in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary. Since 1947, it has occupied the former Warburg Mansion on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street. The choice of Mr. Roche, an internationally celebrated architect whose achievements include the master plan for additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, insured that the museum would assume an even grander presence on Museum Mile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Restaurant Critic Is Named","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/arts/restaurant-critic-is-named.html","abstract":"  The appointment of Ruth Reichl as restaurant critic of The New York Times was announced yesterday by Warren Hoge, assistant managing editor for cultural news and style coverage.

Charles Askegard's long legs and feet did astonishing things to his beats, in a role debut as the Danish cavalier.

For the first half of the 20th century, major league baseball teams stayed put. From 1950 to 1970, 10 of the 16 original clubs relocated, mostly to other cities, and the determining factor in the move seemed to have been the tilting of the neighborhood around the ball park from white to black.   The statistics that support this theory were presented yesterday to the fifth Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and the American Culture by Professors Alan Sager and Arthur Culbert of the Boston University Schools of Public Health and Medicine. \"We'd been studying urban hospitals,\" said Sager, \"and we found that race was the biggest predictor of hospital relocations and closings.

Porter's comic stew of wisecracking Americans and vague Britons ran for 248 performances in New York, closing presumably because people stopped wanting to see it.   There is something both sad and invigorating about this adherence to supply and demand.

M. Rosenthal (column, June 1): Americans of my generation, children of the Depression years, who grew up during World War II and were very active and centrist Democrats, voted for President Clinton because we believed he was an intelligent and practical professional politician who had learned from his McGovern activist days and his governorsip of Arkansas that we as a nation are people of the center. Many of us had voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush in 1988 because we did not agree with the ideology of the Democratic Party or feel represented by its shrill, often faddish culture. We voted for President Clinton.   I am at a loss to understand how this intelligent man could have misunderstood the \"centrist\" message he conveyed during the campaign and made a first priority of the sexual roles of military personnel; then the firing of the travel bureau of the White House in what appeared to be a failure of due process, and then getting a haircut in a plane on a runway while holding up traffic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Review/Theater; Reviving an Intimate Musical With Romantic Intentions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/theater/review-theater-reviving-an-intimate-musical-with-romantic-intentions.html","abstract":"  THE first time I ever walked out of a Broadway show was to see \"She Loves Me\" a second time.

It was now or never. I bolted out of the 2 o'clock matinee of another flop (remember \"Jennie,\" anyone?) to take one last look at \"She Loves Me\" at 3.   Though I didn't know much about anything else in 1963, time has borne out my youthful infatuation with \"She Loves Me.\" The proof is at the Roundabout Theater Company, where this musical has finally received the exquisite revival of its fans' dreams and where surely new fans will soon be made by the legion. An intimate work with nothing on its sophisticated mind other than romance, \"She Loves Me\" is no less an anomaly on Broadway today than it was 30 years ago.

Here, the dead played baseball with the living, vacuum cleaners picked up gold jewelry and gold fillings, and emissaries from the spirit world introduced human beings to a realm of things invisible to see.

The Chicago Bulls, with Barkley out of their hair, turned Game 1 of this National Basketball Association championship series into a casual 100-92 victory, although a conglomerate of Bulls players have since tortured Grant with stormy predictions for Friday's Game 2.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"U.S. Releases 4 of the Chinese Seized From Ship","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/nyregion/us-releases-4-of-the-chinese-seized-from-ship.html","abstract":"  The Immigration and Naturalization Service yesterday released four of the nearly 300 Chinese aliens seized after a freighter ran aground off a Queens beach on Sunday and said it would consider releasing others on a case-by-case basis pending hearings on their claims for asylum.

The United States, Canada, Venezuela and France are preparing to ask the U.N. Security Council to slap a worldwide ban on oil shipments to Haiti, backed up by Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the use of military force. The oil embargo would reinforce a toothless Western Hemisphere economic embargo. And it would be accompanied by a new round of political negotiations timed to exploit Tuesday's resignation of Marc Bazin, the military's figurehead Prime Minister.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930611","headline":"Koch Backs Badillo for Comptroller on 'Fusion' Ticket","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/nyregion/koch-backs-badillo-for-comptroller-on-fusion-ticket.html","abstract":"  Former Mayor Edward I.

Tomorrow, seventh-seeded Wichita State (58-16) will be in its fourth championship game in six trips to the Division I baseball championships. The Shockers will play the winner of today's game between fifth-seeded Louisiana State (51-17-1) and fourth-seeded Long Beach State (46-18). The Shockers, who beat Oklahoma State 12-7 with a late rally in their regular-season meeting this year, took the lead early this time. Walks to Joey Adams, Richie Taylor and Darren Dreifort, his an intentional one with two out, set up Joey Jackson's two-run double in the third. Blake then drove in two with a single and Adam McCollough followed a single by Tommy Tilma with another single to drive in a fifth run off Cowboys starter Jake Benz (9-2). Joe Wallace doubled and Ernesto Rivera drove him home with a single in the bottom of the inning, but Wichita State matched that when Jackson walked with the bases loaded in the fourth. (AP) TENNIS  3 Big Names Move to Quarterfinals  Three former Wimbledon champions, Stefan Edberg of Sweden and Germans Boris Becker and Michael Stich, all advanced to the quarterfinals with victories yesterday at the Queen's Club grass-court championships in London. The second-seeded Edberg turned back a fierce third-set challenge from No. 15-seeded American Richey Reneberg to win by 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-2. Edberg defeated Reneberg for the sixth time in seven meetings but did not gain control until he came back from 40-0 to break serve and take a 3-1 lead in the final set. Becker defeated the 14th-seeded Frenchman, Guillaume Raoux, by 6-4, 6-4, in 80 minutes. Stich marched past 12th-seeded David Wheaton of the United States, 6-4, 6-3. In another match, Grant Stafford, Wednesday's upset winner over top-ranked Pete Sampras, ended his run with a 6-4, 6-3 loss to No. 16 Marc Goellner. (AP) Shriver Rallies to Win: The former champion Pam Shriver found some of her former magic yesterday, recovering from a breakdown in the final set to defeat Mana Endo of Japan, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, at the women's grass-court championships at Edgbaston, England. Shriver, seeded No. 7, won the event from 1984-87. She fell behind by 3-1 in the third but fought back to win on her first match point when Endo netted a backhand. \"I'm grateful I dug this match out,\" Shriver said. \"This is the kind of player on grass I would have chewed up and spat out a few years ago.\" Second-seeded South African Amanda Coetzer joined Martina Navratilova on the sidelines after losing by 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 to Chanda Rubin, seeded 15th.

Hialeah that a city's prohibition of ritual animal sacrifice violated the constitutional right to free exercise of religion. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which was joined in full by Justice John Paul Stevens and in most respects by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Byron R. White. Justice David H. Souter wrote a separate opinion, as did Justice Harry A. Blackmun, whose opinion was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. BY JUSTICE KENNEDY, For the Court    The principle that government may not enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice is so well understood that few violations are recorded in our opinions. Concerned that this fundamental nonpersecution principle of the First Amendment was implicated here, however, we granted certiorari.    Our review confirms that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand, failed to perceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the nation's essential commitment to religious freedom. The challenged laws had an impermissible object, and in all events the principle of general applicability was violated because the secular ends asserted in defense of the laws were pursued only with respect to conduct motivated by religious beliefs. We invalidate the challenged enactments and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.   This case involves practices of the Santeria religion, which originated in the 19th century. When hundreds of thousands of members of the Yoruba people were brought as slaves from eastern Africa to Cuba, their traditional African religion absorbed significant elements of Roman Catholicism. The resulting syncretion, or fusion, is Santeria, \"the way of the saints.\" The Cuban Yoruba express their devotion to spirits, called orishas, through the iconography of Catholic saints. Catholic symbols are often present at Santeria rites, and Santeria devotees attend the Catholic sacraments.    The Santeria faith teaches that every individual has a destiny from God, a destiny fulfilled with the aid and energy of the orishas. The basis of the Santeria religion is the nurture of a personal relation with the orishas, and one of the principal forms of devotion is an animal sacrifice. The sacrifice of animals as part of religious rituals has ancient roots.                    . . .         According to Santeria teaching, the orishas are powerful but not immortal. They depend for survival on the sacrifice. Sacrifices are performed at birth, marriage and death rites, for the cure of the sick, for the initiation of new members and priests, and during an annual celebration. Animals sacrificed in Santeria rituals include chickens, pigeons, doves, ducks, guinea pigs, goats, sheep and turtles. The animals are killed by the cutting of the carotid arteries in the neck. The sacrificed animal is cooked and eaten, except after healing and death rituals.                    . . .         The religion was brought to this nation most often by exiles from the Cuban revolution. The District Court estimated that there are at least 50,000 practitioners in South Florida today.    Petitioner Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye Inc. (Church), is a not-for-profit corporation organized under Florida law in 1973. The Church and its congregants practice the Santeria religion. . . . In April 1987, the Church leased land in the city of Hialeah, Fla., and announced plans to establish a house of worship as well as a school, cultural center, and museum. . . .   The prospect of a Santeria church in their midst was distressing to many members of the Hialeah community.                    . . .         In September 1987, the City Council adopted three substantive ordinances addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Ordinance 87-52 defined \"sacrifice\" as \"to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture or mutilate an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption,\" and prohibited owning or possessing an animal \"intending to use such animal for food purposes.\"                     . . .         The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .\" The city does not argue that Santeria is not a \"religion\" within the meaning of the First Amendment. Nor could it. Although the practice of animal sacrifice may seem abhorrent to some, \"religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.\" Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div. (1981). Given the historical association between animal sacrifice and religious worship, petitioners' assertion that animal sacrifice is an integral part of their religion \"cannot be deemed bizarre or incredible.\" Frazee v. Illinois Dept. of Employment Security (1989). Neither the city nor the courts below, moreover, have questioned the sincerity of petitioners' professed desire to conduct animal sacrifices for religious reasons. We must consider petitioners' First Amendment claim.   In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990).                    . . .         Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible, if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation, the law is not neutral (see Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith) and it is invalid unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest. There are, of course, many ways of demonstrating that the object or purpose of a law is the suppression of religion or religious conduct. To determine the object of a law, we must begin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face. A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or context. Petitioners contend that three of the ordinances fail this test of facial neutrality because they use the words \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual,\" words with strong religious connotations. We agree that these words are consistent with the claim of facial discrimination, but the argument is not conclusive. The words \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\" have a religious origin, but current use admits also of secular meanings. The ordinances, furthermore, define \"sacrifice\" in secular terms, without referring to religious practices.                    . . .         The record in this case compels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of the Santeria worship service was the object of the ordinances. . . . No one suggests, and on this record it cannot be maintained, that city officials had in mind a religion other than Santeria.   It becomes evident that these ordinances target Santeria sacrifice when the ordinances' operation is considered. Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object. To be sure, adverse impact will not always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting. For example, a social harm may have been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart from discrimination. The subject at hand does implicate, of course, multiple concerns unrelated to religious animosity, for example, the suffering or mistreatment visited upon the sacrificed animals and health hazards from improper disposal. But the ordinances when considered together disclose an object remote from these legitimate concerns. The design of these laws accomplishes instead a \"religious gerrymander,\" Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.                    . . .         In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santeria adherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secular killings, and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below committed clear error in failing to reach this conclusion.   We turn next to a second requirement of the Free Exercise Clause, the rule that laws burdening religious practice must be of general applicability. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U. S., at 879-881. All laws are selective to some extent, but categories of selection are of paramount concern when a law has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice. . . .   The principle that government, in pursuit of legitimate interests, cannot in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief is essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause. . . . In this case we need not define with precision the standard used to evaluate whether a prohibition is of general application, for these ordinances fall well below the minimum standard necessary to protect First Amendment rights.                    . . .         We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah's ordinances pursues the city's governmental interests only against conduct motivated by religious belief. The ordinances \"ha(ve) every appearance of a prohibition that society is prepared to impose upon  [ Santeria worshippers ]  but not upon itself.\" The Florida Star v. B. J. F. (1989). This precise evil is what the requirement of general applicability is designed to prevent.   A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny. To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must advance \"interests of the highest order\" and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests. . . . A law that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It follows from what we have already said that these ordinances cannot withstand this scrutiny.                    . . .        BY JUSTICE SOUTER, Concurring   This case turns on a principle about which there is no disagreement, that the Free Exercise Clause bars government action aimed at suppressing religious belief or practice. The Court holds that Hialeah's animal-sacrifice laws violate that principle, and I concur in that holding without reservation.   Because prohibiting religious exercise is the object of the laws at hand, this case does not present the more difficult issue addressed in our last free-exercise case, Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990), which announced the rule that a \"neutral, generally applicable\" law does not run afoul of the Free Exercise Clause even when it prohibits religious exercise in effect. The Court today refers to that rule in dicta, and despite my general agreement with the Court's opinion I do not join Part II, where the dicta appear, for I have doubts about whether the Smith rule merits adherence. I write separately to explain why the Smith rule is not germane to this case and to express my view that, in a case presenting the issue, the Court should re-examine the rule Smith declared.   According to Smith, if prohibiting the exercise of religion results from enforcing a \"neutral, generally applicable\" law, the Free Exercise Clause has not been offended. I call this the Smith rule to distinguish it from the noncontroversial principle, also expressed in Smith, though established long before, that the Free Exercise Clause is offended when prohibiting religious exercise results from a law that is not neutral or generally applicable. It is this noncontroversial principle, that the Free Exercise Clause requires neutrality and general applicability, that is at issue here. But before turning to the relationship of Smith to this case, it will help to get the terms in order, for the significance of the Smith rule is not only in its statement that the Free Exercise Clause requires no more than \"neutrality\" and \"general applicability,\" but in its adoption of a particular, narrow conception of free-exercise neutrality.                    . . .         While general applicability is, for the most part, self-explanatory, free-exercise neutrality is not self-revealing. A law that is religion neutral on its face or in its purpose may lack neutrality in its effect by forbidding something that religion requires . . . . A secular law, applicable to all, that prohibits consumption of alcohol, for example, will affect members of religions that require the use of wine differently from members of other religions and nonbelievers, disproportionately burdening the practice of, say, Catholicism or Judaism. Without an exemption for sacramental wine, Prohibition may fail the test of religion neutrality.   It does not necessarily follow from that observation, of course, that the First Amendment requires an exemption from Prohibition; that depends on the meaning of neutrality as the Free Exercise Clause embraces it. The point here is the unremarkable one that our common notion of neutrality is broad enough to cover not merely what might be called formal neutrality, which as a free-exercise requirement would only bar laws with an object to discriminate against religion, but also what might be called substantive neutrality, which, in addition to demanding a secular object, would generally require government to accommodate religious differences by exempting religious practices from formally neutral laws. If the Free Exercise Clause secures only protection against deliberate discrimination, a formal requirement will exhaust the Clause's neutrality command; if the Free Exercise Clause, rather, safeguards a right to engage in religious activity free from unnecessary governmental interference, the Clause requires substantive, as well as formal, neutrality.   Though Smith used the term \"neutrality\" without a modifier, the rule it announced plainly assumes that free-exercise neutrality is of the formal sort. Distinguishing between laws whose \"object\" is to prohibit religious exercise and those that prohibit religious exercise as an \"incidental effect,\" Smith placed only the former within the reaches of the Free Exercise Clause; the latter, laws that satisfy formal neutrality, Smith would subject to no free-exercise scrutiny at all, even when they prohibit religious exercise in application. The four Justices who rejected the Smith rule, by contrast, read the Free Exercise Clause as embracing what I have termed substantive neutrality. The enforcement of a law \"neutral on its face,\" they said, may \"nonetheless offend  [ the Clause's ]  requirement for government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.\" Id., at 896 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.) The rule these Justices saw as flowing from free-exercise neutrality, in contrast to the Smith rule, \"requir(es) the government to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" Id., at 894 . . . .   The proposition for which the Smith rule stands, then, is that formal neutrality, along with general applicability, are sufficient conditions for constitutionality under the Free Exercise Clause. That proposition is not at issue in this case, however, for Hialeah's animal-sacrifice ordinances are not neutral under any definition, any more than they are generally applicable. This case, rather, involves the noncontroversial principle repeated in Smith, that formal neutrality and general applicability are necessary conditions for free-exercise constitutionality. . . .   In being so readily susceptible to resolution by applying the Free Exercise Clause's \"fundamental nonpersecution principle,\" this is far from a representative free-exercise case. While, as the Court observes, the Hialeah City Council has provided a rare example of a law actually aimed at suppressing religious exercise, Smith was typical of our free-exercise cases, involving as it did a formally neutral, generally applicable law. The rule Smith announced, however, was decidedly untypical of the cases involving the same type of law. Because Smith left those prior cases standing, we are left with a free-exercise jurisprudence in tension with itself, a tension that should be addressed, and that may legitimately be addressed, by re-examining the Smith rule in the next case that would turn upon its application.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930612","headline":"1918: Warning to Labor : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/12/opinion/IHT-1918-warning-to-labor-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON - President Wilson has sent to the American Federation of Labor and to the American Alliance of Labor a telegram: \"The war may be lost in America as well as on the battlefields of France, and unreflecting suspensions of work may render vic","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930612","headline":"Moscow Won't Send More Troops to Balkans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/12/world/moscow-won-t-send-more-troops-to-balkans.html","abstract":"  Despite requests from Britain and France, Russia declined today to commit troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force that is to defend six \"safe havens\" for the beleaguered Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

That style, despite its use of popular songs as a springboard for improvisational flights, is really classical in its attention to pitch, tonal coloration and rhythmic flow.
