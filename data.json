And vice-versa. American press comments about France -- especially when it is preparing to adopt a law on the use of the French language -- generally have been amusing. You would think we were declaring war on English words by expurgating them from the French language, and even preparing to send violators to prison, as some news services have incorrectly reported.\n\nTrue, in France we would rather use \"logiciel\" with our \"ordinateur,\" rather than software with our computers, yet the main problem lies not with the infiltration of English words; it is therefore a pity that focusing on such trivial things distracts everyone from the essence of the debate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Ration Smoking; Don't Ban It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/opinion/ration-smoking-dont-ban-it.html","abstract":"By asking Congress for guidance on regulating nicotine as an addictive drug, the Food and Drug Administration has implicitly raised the prospect of declaring it a controlled substance and banning it. But total prohibition of cigarettes, with no special provision for today's smokers, would create a black market larger than that for cocaine. A smart policy would separate current addicts from new users.\n\nSince almost every smoker picks up the habit during adolescence, the key to reducing smoking is to keep teen-agers from starting. Controls on advertising, a crackdown on sales to minors and designating more smoke-free areas can all help. Raising cigarette taxes would be even more effective, but this approach has its drawbacks if carried to extremes, as experience in Canada has shown. The Canadian tax of $5 a pack, introduced in the early 90's, reduced smoking among teen-agers, but it was a huge burden on low-income people addicted to cigarettes (a two-pack-a-day smoker carried a $3,500 annual habit). It also made drugstores the targets of tobacco robberies and spurred so much tax evasion -- eventually 80 percent of cigarettes smoked in Canada were smuggled -- that this year the Government had to cut the tariff to keep up tax revenues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Firepower and Ice: Lake Superior State Ambushes B.U.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/sports/ncaa-championship-firepower-and-ice-lake-superior-state-ambushes-bu.html","abstract":"  For a college hockey championship game, a 9-1 score is astonishing, like 100-50 in basketball or 73-0 in football.

Her art cannot be measured listening blind, which is why she has made very few recordings. She viscerally inhabited the role, radiating Elektra's righteous madness; the flashes of anguish and fury on her face were frightening to behold. She quickly took possession of the set and made sense of its awkward topography. From the outset, she had the audience in thrall; after the curtain, shredded Stagebills rained down from the balconies like confetti.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"1894:Furious Artistes : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/opinion/IHT-1894furious-artistes-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW YORK - An outrageous article appeared in the Chicago Times in regard to Mmes.

It has received scant attention in the West, even though the U.S. will be an important participant.

May thine glories never fade   Or perish in an ambuscade!   Every spring about this time, I conclude that my place in baseball history is not yet secure. Few believe there was ever a time without an Opening Day, but there was such a time, and it was I who greased the sleeves of the club owners with \"Say, boys, wouldn't it be grand if every season began on the same day? Oh, what an adventure that would be!\"   \"Well, boys,\" the pooh-bahs exclaimed, \"does the lad have a point or not?\" The lad was 12, and did. The year, 1878.   We called our game base-ball back then, which seemed such a waste of space. That's another of my contributions. I still preserve a copy of my letter to the Scribes Association of 1875. \"Oh, you Scribes,\" I postulated, \"drop the hyphen and save the space!\" I signed it \"A NineYearOld With Ideas in His Bean.\" And that's what I was.   With my brother Neddy I spent many unsupervised hours tossing a Cognac bottle up against our barn. The game was to make our mother come bounding and leaping out. My, but she was widely held to be insane! Her appearances each counted as a run. Later, Neddy, who penned verse to toughen his fielding hand, dashed off these lines in her sainted honor: Mother, your apron is burning,   But I cannot put it out.   I'm miles away in a pasture,   Playing base-ball  [ sic ]  like a lout.   Mother, your leggings are burning,   They have a phosphoric smell.   But I'm running bases, Dear Heart,   They'll love your pies in Hell.    When it became too dark to continue our games, we would join our comrades of all ages in sitting around and yacking baseball, forever baseball, unless someone had plague blankets, and then we dared each other to sleep in them.   But soon it was back to baseball. I heard much wild talk of the tragedy of the Monitor and the Merrimac, and the number of lefty twirlers who gave their lives on those ships. At these times, in the closing dark, we felt a special sense of each other's destinies, but tastefully, we kept that kind of news to ourselves.   On one occasion, the superb Kid Gerty loomed at the center of our bunch. The chesty second sacker had been recently expelled from the Hartfords for muffing a superstition. \"Boys, I let a missionary parade about in my uniform. What harm could it do this once?\" he sobbed. \"I was dead wrong, and my mates were right to cast me out.\"   I asked Gerty did I have the stuff to be a true professional.   \"Oh, I couldn't say,\" he replied. \"It would crush you. No, I haven't a clue.\" This judgment much inflated my standing in town.   Truly, baseball of my day had seized the national imagination, so that made for trouble right there. I observed that there was entirely too much pretending going on. \"Play back, boys, I'm peerless Cappy Anson and he bats like this\" was a common fantasy of the fields. Or perhaps, \"See me, boys, I'm the barrel-chested O'Rourke twins. Say, watch how we feature the stick!\" Gosh, it was an epidemic.   To combat such carelessness, I became the Stance Authenticator, a service which, at 5 cents a player or a dollar a team, was a small price to pay for uniformity. What an inspiring sight it must have been to our women: hundreds of men and boys lined across a meadow, getting Cappy Anson's infernal hitch exactly right.   Inevitably, as my fame spread, I was visited by the Rule Book Committee of the Sporting Clubs -- Benny Songstreet, Senor Lou Cash, P. K. Thotny.    Senor Cash was humming It ain't no rupture, Roger   I'm a-stayin' in the Game.  Thotny asked, \"You the logical boy?\"    I conveyed that I was.   \"Gather round, boys,\" he whispered. \"We are in disarray. Disarray. Where is this season's logic when the Bostons have played all winter, all night, 50 or 60 games a week, salting away enough victories already -- 909 -- to cop the flag several times over? The Indianapoli, however, refuse to commence until their 'grand march' to the Grain Library is done. The Milwauks began yesterday, but the Chi Nine rooters have already accused them of letting gamblers take the field while players roam freely through the stands. Can you help us? Oh, a mumpy randomness is starting to spot the body of a noble racket!\"    \"Infatuated amateurs,\" I cried. \"Smug mice! You must decree one Opening Day and make the squads adhere or else. Then, expunge the records of this erstwhile silly season. The pleasures of monotony are ours for the taking! Oh, isn't this just the life?\"    What is it about those days and ways, why do they haunt me still, inning by inning, pitch by pitch, rolling ever onward like a baseball, endlessly stitched? I gave you the best I've gotten   I spent all the shells I've shotten   My tale is bereft   But it's all I got left   I'm afraid it adds up to notten.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Blazers Feel the Clinch As Nets Feel the Pinch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/sports/pro-basketball-blazers-feel-the-clinch-as-nets-feel-the-pinch.html","abstract":"  For the second straight game, Nets Coach Chuck Daly watched helplessly as his team, playing at home, had a playoff-bound club on the ropes only to go down to defeat.

Once inside golf's pearly gates, though, players are faced with an array of shots that can be as inscrutable as Augusta is beautiful. Everywhere on the manicured grounds are shots that are frightening, puzzling, perplexing and unforgiving. The first tee shot of the week at No. 1. The second shot at the fifth hole. The second at the 13th. The tee shot at the 18th. Any putt from above the hole. All are worthy of note and all received votes as the toughest Masters shot in an informal player poll leading up to the tournament. Nicklaus Isn't Immune    But of all the 72 or so shots facing the field of 88 golfers each day in the Masters, which begins Thursday, none are more demanding than the tee shot at the shortest hole on the course, the 12th, 155 yards of hell called, ironically, Golden Bell.

This 90-minute offering in \"The American Experience\" series brings home the effects of the official policy through the experience of Kurt Klein, who came to the United States in 1937 as a 17-year-old refugee from Germany, leaving his parents behind, temporarily, they hoped. As the narrator recalls the growing threat to European Jewry, from Kristallnacht in November 1938 to the death camps of the 1940's, Mr. Klein tells how his parents' efforts to flee to America were repeatedly blocked by State Department functionaries.

Wherever he went, he was accompanied by a sense of theatrical history, which was as endemic to his personality as his silver-tipped cane and black velour hat. For most of his life, he undertook two potentially adversarial careers, as director and as drama critic, roles that in Clurman's case were complementary. This means that he was an astute observer of major artistic events as well as a participant in them, beginning with the founding of the Group Theater in 1931.    His memoir, \"All People Are Famous,\" was a step removed from autobiography. It was, he said, \"about myself through others.\" One might suggest that the posthumous new book, \"The Collected Works of Harold Clurman\" (Applause Books), is about Clurman through the plays he saw. It is literally the story of his life in the theater.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940406","headline":"Riesenberg Stays Put But Collins May Split","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/06/sports/pro-football-riesenberg-stays-put-but-collins-may-split.html","abstract":"  Free agency has proved to be what most people thought it would be: a wild roller-coaster ride in which teams try to gut one another.
