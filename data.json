Not only would the virus spread rapidly through sexual contact but it would also contaminate the nation's blood supply. Many homosexual men had been giving blood in an effort to help find a vaccine against another disease, hepatitis B, that seemed to attack homosexuals.

The answer is that some did better than others and many seemed to cancel each other out, as is often the case when so many similar books emerge at once. It will take months before final figures are in, of course. But so far, in a field that runs the gamut from coffee-table picture books to meticulously researched biographies to outre accounts of new conspiracy theories, the most successful has been Gerald Posner's \"Case Closed\" (Random House), which takes the radically unradical view that there was no conspiracy surrounding Kennedy's assassination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931201","headline":"Critic's Notebook; A 'Nutcracker' Filmed From Balanchine's Angle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/01/movies/critic-s-notebook-a-nutcracker-filmed-from-balanchine-s-angle.html","abstract":"  Fans of the seven-headed Mouse King will be thrilled to see their favorite villain in yucky detail as he sallies forth in the film \"George Balanchine's 'The Nutcracker.' \" Like Tchaikovsky's two other ballets, \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Swan Lake,\" \"The Nutcracker\" incorporates a fable about the forces of light and darkness.

Both responses can catch women in a vicious cycle of low self-esteem and depression and can worsen anger because the issues that provoke it are never resolved, the study findings indicate.

The first film to discover that, if properly awed, audiences would pay to see it again and again was \"The Great Train Robbery\" in 1903. Without the trains, of course, there would be no Wild West.

To have a room like that, she caroled, would be \"loverly.\" Most people, whatever their condition, want such a refuge, and none more than those for whom home is a street corner and bed a steam grating.   That room is now being realized on Manhattan's West 43d Street, in the Times Square Hotel, which was splendid in 1923 when it opened and derelict by 1991. That was when a group of nonprofit entrepreneurs called Common Ground stepped in. Using $28 million from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, along with every tax credit and corporate contribution they could muster, Common Ground has turned the hotel's 735 squalid rooms into 650 small apartments. All have private baths and most have kitchens.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931202","headline":"Met Awards to Thomas and Donahue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/02/sports/sports-people-golf-met-awards-to-thomas-and-donahue.html","abstract":"  The Metropolitan Golf Association's two most prestigious awards went to JEFF THOMAS of Plainfield West in New Jersey and JOE DONAHUE of the Garden City Golf Club on Long Island.
