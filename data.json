For the addicts, artists and other types that the Village Voice columnist Guy Trebay has met roaming the boroughs, that credo is more than a coping mechanism, it's a way of life. Yet in the face of the familiar urban plagues -- crack, heroin and AIDS -- Mr. Trebay's subjects remain fiercely optimistic, like the woman on East Third Street who planted a formal garden next door to a haven for drug addicts, or the artist who hung the trees in a vacant 125th Street lot with empty Ripple wine bottles. These and other bypassed New Yorkers find sympathetic commentary in Mr. Trebay's collection of Voice columns, IN THE PLACE TO BE: Guy Trebay's New York (Temple University, cloth, $49.95; paper, $19.95). Portrayed in Sylvia Plachy's haunting photographs, Mr. Trebay's subjects hold forth in the city's distinct vernacular. The author does not use his role as chronicler to moralize. There are no politics or preaching in his candid takes on a venereal disease clinic, a crack hot line or a homeless woman who lives in the 145th Street subway station. This is a frank and engaging look at a city that teaches its inhabitants not to make eye contact. \nHANNA RUBIN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Philistinism All Over Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/arts/l-victim-art-philistinism-all-over-again-456295.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In the storm of mostly self-serving responses to Arlene Croce's \"non-review\" of Bill T.

And the building's design, by Robert A. M.

Not that the new building isn't steeped in history. Disney's sprawling global empire of fantasy and real estate was built on animation, and the modest buildings in which Snow White and Bambi were born still stand on the company's lot in Burbank, Calif.. But in the years after Disney's death in 1966, the company's commitment to animation had faltered. By the time Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, revived that commitment, with the success of \"Beauty and the Beast\" in 1991, working quarters for the company's shrunken animation department had been split into eight different off-lot locations. The new building, which brings together most of the department's 1,400 animators beneath one roof, thus signifies a reunion as well as a revival.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"'I Gave So Much to Others?'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/books/i-gave-so-much-to-others.html","abstract":"  ANAIS NIN A Biography.

To heighten interest in his recitals, he took the stage wearing doeskin gloves and demonstratively removed them finger by finger before beginning to play.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"PENCHANTS & PLACES \nEssays and Criticism.\nBy Brad Leithauser.\nKnopf, $25.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Let's Not Forget Poor Children in the Welfare Reform Debate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/opinion/l-let-s-not-forget-poor-children-in-the-welfare-reform-debate-447995.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Any welfare reform effort must give highest priority to protecting affected children by helping their parents obtain jobs with adequate wages.

They are wrong. The American people are not nearly as isolationist as the moronic politicians who speak in their name.   The Chicago Council on Foreign Relations has been tracking American attitudes on foreign policy since 1974. Its latest poll, conducted by Gallup and released today, shows the following: 65 percent of those surveyed said the U.S. should \"take an active part\" in world affairs rather than \"stay out.\" That is up from the 1980's.

Many of the trails are really ancient shortcuts, once used by shepherds, farmers and peddlers as a steep but faster way to get from one village or one valley to another. James Fenimore Cooper, during a sojourn in Switzerland in the 1820's, hiked part of the route, and by the middle of that century the tour was popular with British visitors.

The problem is whether the West Side will be a series of commercial strips with occasional landscaping, like the conservancy-approved Chelsea Piers project, or a landscaped shoreline with unobstructed views of the Hudson River.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Norman and Jacobsen Are Tied at 15 Under At Once-Difficult Doral","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/sports/golf-norman-and-jacobsen-are-tied-at-15-under-at-once-difficult-doral.html","abstract":"  One by one they charged across the submissive Blue Monster today, firing at pins and draining putts from everywhere.

At the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, an abstract painter in the guise of a realist who chronicles timeless aspects of life, meets Jean-Michel Basquiat, who was a rafter on the stream of consciousness.\n\nMangold's retrospective consists of 58 paintings made between 1976 and 1994 that evince an especially severe, if essentially American subject matter. The earliest works are paintings of bare wooden floors, sometimes depicted reflected in mirrors, that our Puritan ancestors would have countenanced. She emphasizes a geometrical blockiness, a planked floor is essentially a grid, but also has the freedom to indulge in the amorphousness of wood grain. Sections are often so precise as to be trompe l'oeil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Driving a Cataract, And Other Tricks Of Sitcom Writing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/arts/television-view-driving-a-cataract-and-other-tricks-of-sitcom-writing.html","abstract":"  ONE DISTINCTIVE characteristic of our species, other than the fact that we are the only creatures prone to accidentally tucking our shirts into our underpants, is that everyone has a different opinion as to what's funny, although, in general, it would be safe to say that no one finds anything amusing about a run-on sentence, particularly at the beginning of a newspaper article. It should also be remembered that different approaches suit different media. Thus, the witty Salinger allusion may be undeniably pithy in a review of John Irving's new novel, but in a sample script for \"Empty Nest\" a reference to Nell Carter's cellulite is certainly more appropriate.   And, with all due respect, such cellulite commentary might also lead to an annual income far surpassing that of most book critics. A funny sample script (referred to as a \"spec\" script) is Hollywood's calling card, and it can lead to employment as a disgustingly overpaid television scribe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"A New Restaurant Will Prepare American and Asian-Marinated Steaks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/nyregion/a-la-carte-a-new-restaurant-will-prepare-american-and-asian-marinated-steaks.html","abstract":"  EAST will meet West in Huntington Village when Miller's Steak House opens in May.

Well, language may have been a problem at first.

At their first meeting, they played tennis without a net, carefully keeping score. Robert Frost would compare free verse to playing tennis without a net, meaning that rules were necessary to give resonance to art; Duchamp and Man Ray made careers out of breaking rules in pursuit of new resonance and new ways of playing the game.    By the time they met, Duchamp (1887-1968) had already contributed to the founding of Dada in Europe. His \"Nude Descending a Staircase\" had caused a scandal at the 1913 Armory Show in New York; one newspaper called it an \"explosion in a shingle factory,\" and even Teddy Roosevelt berated it. Man Ray (1890-1976) did not have his first one-man show until a month or so after their meeting, but he was already operating on a Dada wavelength.

That may be one reason the music took so many forms (jazz, blues, gospel), and why the offshoot of each form had its own name (rhythm-and-blues, doo-wop, soul), and its own musical, and social, twist. But none of these forms had lived an entirely segregated life: to one degree or another they had all taken what they wanted or needed from white music. With its youthful postwar brashness, aimed at teen-agers, rock-and-roll sped up this process.   The black pioneers of rock-and-roll were not giving America unfettered race testimony or self-expression. They were giving America calculated entertainment in bright racial Technicolor. Rock-and-roll was show business. To secure a mass audience it had to appeal to young blacks across class lines: be funky but suave too; primal, then languid, then ironic. And it had to lure young whites across both class lines and the great racial divide: it had to be exotic enough to thrill them but familiar enough to make them feel at home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Once There Was Shag and a Family Called Brady","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/movies/taking-the-children-once-there-was-shag-and-a-family-called-brady-465195.html","abstract":"  The Brady Bunch Movie  Shelley Long, Gary Cole and special appearances by RuPaul, the Monkees and original cast members Directed by Betty Thomas PG-13 95 minutes","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercedes-Benz C36; Sumptuous Sedan For Serious Fun","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/automobiles/behind-the-wheel-mercedes-benz-c36-sumptuous-sedan-for-serious-fun.html","abstract":"  HAVING grown up in a German family, I think I can safely say that giddy humor is not the touchstone of my ethnicity.

So she called the midwife, who told her not to worry.    Two months later, Mrs. Njoku's baby was born dead. The 8-pound 14-ounce boy's heart had stopped beating a day before he was delivered on Jan. 17, 1993. It was the first time during her pregnancy that she was examined by an obstetrician.   If there is a lesson to be learned from Mrs. Njoku's journey through New York's public hospital system, it is that even the most diligent of expectant mothers can be defeated by a medical bureaucracy that sometimes provides only minimal care.

Even if its third act betrays the limits of Puccini's attention span, \"La Rondine\" represents a typically sweet, lyrical and self-indulgent take on Viennese popular style.   It is, in fact, an operetta turned tragic, as if Puccini was as reluctant as ever to let one of his heroines walk away happy. Here she is Magda, who abandons luxurious courtesanship for the love of Ruggero. He is young, respectable and not terribly bright. After two months of sinful bliss on the Mediterranean (during which time he seems never to have asked where Magda came from) Ruggero proposes marriage. Knowing she will have to tell his family the truth, Magda goes back to Rambaldo, her former keeper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950306","headline":"The Clamor in Mexico: Sullied Name Stirs Salinas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/06/world/the-clamor-in-mexico-sullied-name-stirs-salinas.html","abstract":"  Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is assured of a place in Mexican history, but the baffling events of the past week make it almost certain that it will not be the place he so desperately tried to attain.

But in concert, where bluesmen used to prove themselves, Mr. Guy has turned into a peculiar amalgam of blues master and showboating celebrity, devoted more to working a crowd than to playing the blues.   On Thursday night at the Academy, he faced a typical current blues audience: overwhelmingly white, largely male and out to party. It's an audience that both appreciates the performer and treats him like a gifted freak or a servant.

The Vienna showed off its familiar warm string sound, which can make ordinary orchestral legato seem quirky and edgy, along with a melting, penetrating brass sound that burnishes ordinarily blaring climaxes. It also had the sort of proprietary confidence about the repertory that early-music groups usually possess.

The new date means that people in the New World, in the Tehuacan valley of the central Mexican state of Puebla in particular, probably did not begin growing their most important crop until as much as 4,000 or 5,000 years after the beginning of agriculture in the Old World. Hunter-gatherers who settled along the Jordan River valley managed to domesticate wild progenitors of wheat and barley as early as 9,000 to 10,000 years ago, and thus became, as far as anyone knows, the first farmers anywhere.

Two weeks ago, after the Slovak radio's Washington correspondent, Peter Susko, reported that a Meciar trade delegation to the United States appeared poorly prepared, he was ordered home and the Washington office was closed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"For Paris Opéra, a New Baton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/style/IHT-for-paris-opera-a-new-baton.html","abstract":"The tumult and the shouting may be on the way out at the Opéra Bastille, the confused sloganeering and clownish violence a thing of the past, insofar as it may be possible to risk any prediction about an institution whose history, both recent and di","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"Observer; Trial by Trial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/opinion/observer-trial-by-trial.html","abstract":"  After many years of watching the most widely celebrated trial in human history, I slipped quietly into a coma.

Four of the seven teams, including One Australia, voted to allow time to regroup.

IN CITY HOSPITALS, CHAOTIC BUREAUCRACY   When New York City's public hospitals underwent their last major reorganization more than 25 years ago, civic leaders renewed a longstanding promise to bring medical care for the poor up to the standards of the best private hospitals. The system that emerged is now under attack for both its ideology and its cost. But long before the change in political sentiment, New York's public hospitals were moving toward a crisis of their own making, with problems that had a familiar ring. A1. ALLEGATIONS OF CO-OP FRAUD   Year after year, the retirees and working-class families who live in the Big Six Towers cooperative in Queens dutifully paid their monthly maintenance fees. And with the promise of great earnings, many even invested their life savings in a plan to expand Big Six's shopping center. But the stunned residents of the Big Six have now learned that they may never recover their investments. A1.

D'Amato plans to announce his support for Senator Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign, a move that is expected to trigger a chain reaction of endorsements for Mr. Dole by New York Republicans. B5.

Republican officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they expect Gov. George E. Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, to follow Mr. D'Amato's lead quickly. The three party leaders forged a strong alliance in last year's gubernatorial race and want to duplicate it in 1996, the officials said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"Patterns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/style/patterns-637095.html","abstract":"  Taking His Title With Him    If fashion is entertainment, there are probably few players left who could upstage Andre Leon Talley, who last week resigned as creative director of Vogue in what he described as a \"creative Chernobyl.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950307","headline":"Anne Frank's Friend To Read Diary Excerpts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/books/anne-frank-s-friend-to-read-diary-excerpts.html","abstract":"  Miep Gies, the Dutchwoman who helped hide the family of Anne Frank from the Nazis during World War II, is among those who are to take part in a free reading on Thursday at 12:30 P.M. at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 55th Street.

Cochran Jr., spent much of a day abbreviated by a shortened daily calendar and a bomb scare cross-examining Detective Tom Lange, one of two police officers who headed the investigation. Mr. Cochran posited two alternative scenarios for the night of June 12, 1994, when Mrs. Simpson and her friend were killed: both theories, he suggested, received only minimal police consideration.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950307","headline":"Take to the Field, Please : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/opinion/IHT-take-to-the-field-please-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"I have been away from the United States for 14 years, but I have watched from afar.

But on Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall, Mr. Spivakov and his pianist, Sergei Bezrodny, offered a view of Mozart's Sonata in G (K. 379) -- or at least, its Adagio -- that had a late Beethovenian expansiveness. Its opening piano chords were not merely rolled but were also suffused with dramatic portent, an effect that Mr. Spivakov turned to his advantage at the violin line's entrance.    Throughout the Adagio, Mr. Spivakov played with a rich, centered tone and a focused, thoughtfully regulated vibrato. The Allegro and the closing variations were slightly leaner and more conventionally Mozartean, although Mr. Spivakov's singing tone, the breadth of his coloristic palette and his interaction with Mr. Bezrodny remained the reading's principal attractions. Similar charms enlivened the extroverted reading of Schubert's Fantasie in C (D. 934), which closed the program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950307","time":"1995-03-07
