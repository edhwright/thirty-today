A young woman is robbed on a lonely ridge near her home. The mugging, which takes place on the woman's wedding day, leaves her in a state of disorientation. Her confusion lasts almost to the end of the play, a convoluted tale about siblings and cousins who live their lives without a sense of direction or destination.   Does change come through choice or chance? Ms. Johnson's answer is as elusive as her narrative. One point she is evidently trying to make is that people are trapped not only by their past mistakes and but also by the actions of their parents. For these characters, life can be as uncontrollable as a runaway roller coaster. As the play (at the Manhattan Theater Club) veers from eccentric comedy to pathos, the theatrical role model it evokes is Beth Henley's \"Crimes of the Heart.\" But where Ms. Henley made us care deeply about her people, those in Ms. Johnson's family play quickly wear out their welcome.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930125","headline":"Paperhandlers Reject Proposed Contract","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/25/nyregion/paperhandlers-reject-proposed-contract.html","abstract":"  The union representing paperhandlers at The New York Times voted yesterday not to ratify an agreement that its leadership reached with the newspaper in December.

While moody indecisiveness is certainly not antithetical to playing Hamlet, it is debilitating when it comes to \"Henry V.\" Although Henry does not have to be played heroically, one cannot believe Mr. Rylance's King has triumphed over his misspent youth and is capable of leading his army against the French.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930125","headline":"Cuban Olympic Runner Badly Burned at Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/25/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-cuban-olympic-runner-badly-burned-at-home.html","abstract":"  ANA QUIROT, Cuba's star middle-distance runner, was reported in critical but stable condition yesterday from extensive burns suffered in what was described as a household accident.

Flowerhead, from Austin, Tex., wore the long hair and unpretentious clothes of the so-called grunge scene.

Thompson   By E. Jean Carroll    Illustrated. 341 pages. Dutton. $25.     At first, Hunter S.

Then the fame attended his decline as a writer, traceable in four uneven collections: \"The Great Shark Hunt\" (1979), \"The Curse of Lono\" (1983), \"Generation of Swine\" (1988) and \"Songs of the Doomed\" (1990). In short, in the broadest outline of his career as an American writer, Mr. Thompson seems almost boringly archetypal.   One detail does set him apart, however: the question of whether to believe what he wrote, and if so, how much. As Mr. Thompson himself once observed of the out-of-control, drug-abusing self he offers up in what he called his \"gonzo\" journalism: \"The smart people in the media knew it was a weird exaggeration.

Having lost about $100 million (including $40 million this season) on its National Football League contract, NBC heads to Pasadena for its first Super Bowl since 1989 in the hope of saving a smidgen of financial face.  NBC paid $752 million in 1990 for four years of N.F.L. games, the lowest outlay of the three networks (ABC paid $900 million and CBS paid $1.06 billion). According to network insiders, NBC has valued the Super Bowl at $40 million. There is no N.F.L.-specified Super Bowl rights fee, and a network can allocate its Super Bowl fee in any way it wishes.    To balance the $40 million cost, NBC is charging $850,000 for 30-second commercial spots during the game.

Yet the film has a completely contemporary sensibility as it tells the story of Motl, a proud dairy farmer, the patriarch of the only Jewish family in his village, when he is faced by a state-backed pogrom. Mr. Astrakhan is less interested in Jewish culture than in the ways in which racism serves the purposes of nationalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930126","headline":"Science vs. Women -- A Radical Solution","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/26/opinion/science-vs-women-a-radical-solution.html","abstract":"Science, like all human activity, has its individual cultural milieu. The culture of science evolved in a period when it was being practiced exclusively by men, and that has greatly influenced the outcome. It is a men's game and it continues to be played by men's rules.\n\nAlthough we would like to believe that scientists are driven by a desire to understand some aspect of the natural world, in fact they are also driven by a desire for personal recognition. Sociologists of science like Robert Merton have identified this need for personal recognition as a motivating force in science. This can lead to behavior which is, at the very least, unattractive: aggressive attacks on competitors, secrecy, sometimes even prevarication.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930126","headline":"Holman's Run at Mile","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/26/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-holman-s-run-at-mile.html","abstract":"  STEVE HOLMAN, the latest in a long line of potentially great American milers, has studied JIM RYUN, MARTY LIQUOURI and others who have turned his 22-year-old life into a bundle of expectations.   \"I'm still trying to find out about the mile mystique,\" Holman said at a track writers' luncheon yesterday. \"It's just three laps and a kick.

The year 1989, when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and Eastern Europe emerged from the shadow of the Soviet Union, not only marked the end of the 20th century but also the waning of a great historical epoch, the passing of the Modern Age, which witnessed the rise of liberalism, humanism and bourgeois culture throughout the Western world.

Every morning, she buys an armful of newspapers and reads whatever they offer about the ongoing trial across two rivers in Glen Ridge, N.J., a trial that is now in its 15th week.    For her, those papers hold more than abstract headlines about four young men accused of sexually assaulting a retarded young woman with the mental age of a child. More, too, than the legal debate over whether the girl was capable of consent. To this mother, the case is her every worry made real.  Tough Issue Made Tougher    \"When your daughter is retarded, you think about this kind of thing a lot,\" said the woman, who would not allow her name to be used because she did not want to violate the privacy of her daughter, who is in her late 20's. \"My daughter is affectionate.

Collins, holding that a state prisoner facing execution for a murder he claims not to have committed is not ordinarily entitled to have that claim reviewed in Federal court. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the 6-to-3 majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas; Justice Byron R. White did not sign the opinion but concurred in the result. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter. FROM THE OPINION By Chief Justice Rehnquist    Petitioner Leonel Torres Herrera was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in January 1982. He unsuccessfully challenged the conviction on direct appeal and state collateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a Federal habeas petition. In February 1992, 10 years after his conviction he urged in a second Federal habeas petition that he was \"actually innocent\" of the murder for which he was sentenced to death, and that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process of law therefore forbid his execution. He supported this claim with affidavits tending to show that his now-dead brother, rather than he, had been the perpetrator of the crime. Petitioner urges us to hold that this showing of innocence entitles him to relief in this Federal habeas proceeding. We hold that it does not.                    . . .

He has acted as his own general manager for football operations, and has run the college draft as well. But the issue flared after the 1991 season when he fired Mike Shanahan, his offensive coordinator, in a disagreement over how the offense should be run. Even though Reeves had hired Shanahan and given him the title, he didn't want him to have control.    The owner: Pat Bowlen was angered by the Shanahan move and insisted Shanahan stay. But Reeves, whose title was vice president/head coach, pointed to his contract. Bowlen had to back down and announced, \"By virtue of his contract, Dan has the right to hire and fire coaches.\" It was apparent to many people then that Bowlen was not going to allow either Reeves or that contract to remain in force.   Dealing with the superstar: In Denver, there has been only one: John Elway. His relationship with Reeves, although rocky, was successful: Elway, the nervous, impatient star, and Reeves, the organized, no-nonsense pedagogue.   Elway has denied, as did Bowlen, that he was responsible for Reeves's departure. A few weeks before Reeves was dismissed, Elway suggested publicly that the coach should delegate authority, that he had taken too much on himself. And Elway was known to object to Reeves's firing of Shanahan. Possible Problems Reeves Will Face in New York  Dealing with George Young and the owners: The owners won't interfere. Reeves can do all the talking he wants as far as the college draft and picking free agents. But he won't have the final say. That is George Young's call. Tom Boisture, the player personnel director, oversees the draft and will listen to Reeves. Reeves has told Young that he doesn't expect the sort of control he exercised in Denver. Still, how will he handle it if he doesn't get his way?   The media: On a typical Wednesday, Reeves will be faced by more print and electronic media types than he saw before any game in Denver, except for the conference championship. His Southern hospitality will be taxed, but he seems to be able to handle crowds now. After all, he has been to the Super Bowl.   Dealing with veterans: There are no prima donas on the Giants' offense, no one who is as dominant as Elway in Denver. Reeves will control the offense and its players. If he chooses Jeff Hostetler as his quarterback, which seems likely, he will find a performer who tends to whine if things don't go his way. But Hoss, with the mechanical skills to run a Reeves-type varied offense, will do his bidding. Lawrence Taylor? The most famous Giant on defense, if he decides to return, is unlikely to play the defining role he enjoyed throughout his career. Still, Reeves probably will incorporate Taylor's style into the new defensive schemes. It is hard to imagine Reeves losing control of the defense the way Ray Handley did.   Motivation: By becoming the coach, Reeves immediately brings more authority to the role than Handley. The Giants still like to think of themselves as the Super Bowl team, and in Reeves they have a coach who wears more Super Bowl rings than anyone else -- eight (two as the Cowboys' option halfback, three as a Cowboys' assistant, three as the Broncos' head coach).

Moliere, who certainly recognized a good part when he wrote it, chose to play the title role in the original production in 1671. Since then, \"Scapin\" has come to be accepted as a most durable farce and one that can be subjected to open interpretation, as in \"Scapino,\" the mirthful Jim Dale-Frank Dunlop Italianate variation. At the Classic Stage Company through Feb. 21, Andrei Belgrader gives the play a freewheeling workout, updating it with contemporary references and underscoring it with a harsher line.   As always, \"Scapin\" needs an agile scamp, in this case, Stanley Tucci, a quick-change clown with a sly deadpan and a gift for mimicry. With more malevolence than is customary in the role, he puts the intricate plot in motion and then casually sidesteps into improvisation. Interrupting the play, he converses with theatergoers, scrambles through the seats and then settles back waiting for the comedy to continue. But without him onstage, the show takes a long pause.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930127","headline":"Historical Society Puts Up Artworks As Loan Collateral","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/arts/historical-society-puts-up-artworks-as-loan-collateral.html","abstract":"  The financially beleaguered New-York Historical Society has put up $3 million worth of artworks from its collection as collateral to secure a $1.5 million commercial loan it says it needs to survive.
