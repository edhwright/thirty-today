It was begun in 1937 by the remarkable Anne O'Hare McCormick and was originally called \"In Europe.\" In those days \"In Europe\" was foreign affairs for most Americans, and it seemed perfectly natural that the paper's one overseas columnist was rooted on the European Continent. Mrs. McCormick's 1954 obituary in The Times said she got her start in foreign reporting \"as the wife of Mr. McCormick, a Dayton engineer whom she accompanied on frequent buying trips to Europe.\"    Obviously, I was born in a very different era, one in which columnists only have to accompany their curiosity and engineers travel to Tokyo for buying trips, not Paris. Both factors have led me to start my column from Japan. While I have no intention of calling my column \"In Asia,\" the thought did cross my mind. Let's face it, when the history of the late 20th century is written, the most important event may not be the reconstruction of Europe, the cold war or the collapse of Communism, but rather the rapid modernization in one generation of two billion people from Japan to the border of India.

We post-moderns are by now so far from the modernist repudiation of Victorian influence that we can look with an unembarrassed eye -- an eye of one's own, we might say -- at the three-decker Victorian novel's subplots and coincidences, its bloated serializations, its unnaturally heightened and speechifying dialogue. We can see past their potboiler mechanisms into what these baggy old novelists humanly, and sometimes half-divinely, knew.\n\nAnthony Trollope has long been excluded from this percipient, and undeceived, reassessment. He is nearly the only Victorian novelist who has been critically doomed to remain a Victorian. He alone appears to be unforgiven. Dickens and Henry James and George Eliot and Thackeray -- even the colonialist-imperialist Kipling! -- are permitted, and sometimes prodded, to transcend the accident of their chronology and the confines of their mores. Only Trollope is regarded as still mired in his devices -- devices that are, in their pre-video yet cinematic way, archetypes of our present-day story-machines, glowing like colored apothecary globes in rooms where pianos used to stand. Trollope, in brief, is dismissed as a kind of antiquated television set; he is said to be \"undemanding.\" Dickens, by contrast, survives in all his greatness as caricaturist; George Eliot as moralist; Thackeray as ironist; Hardy as determinist.

Varanasi -- also an ancient name, derived from the Varuna River, not from the city's more famous river, the Ganges, into which the Varuna flows -- was twisted by the British into Benares (\"b\" and \"v\" sounds are often blurred in Hindi).

A quiet and almost secret place, it has in it virtually no object of intrinsic value. Its installation is rudimentary. But it is her own room, with her belongings all around, nothing added or subtracted. The linden trees outside the window are the ones whose agitated shadows she remembered in times of trouble. How could her presence not be felt to an almost overwhelming degree?   From 1925 to 1952, it was the nearest thing to a permanent home she had. Here between 1935 and 1940 she composed \"Requiem,\" a sequence of poems from which posterity will know what it was to be in St. Petersburg during the Stalinist terror and to live in dread from day to day.

By 1988 the Republican candidate, George Bush, was talking of blending fiscal stringency with a caring heart. The election of Bill Clinton in 1992 seemed a declaration that Americans wanted a government that lifted the needy instead of punishing them.    But as 1995 dawns, a new band of hard-talking officeholders and social engineers has created a compassion crisis in American political life. Their political energy flows in part from the well-crafted fiction, originally promulgated under President Reagan, that the wealthy are embattled.

The year will also provide the occasion for a thorough reappraisal of British music, which is timely, for the reputation of British music abroad is not wholly positive. The stigma bestowed by the contemptuous dismissal of pastoral English music from the start of this century as \"cowpat school\" (a phrase reputedly coined by one of the few British composers with strong Schoen bergian leanings, Elisabeth Lutyens) has stuck, and British composers are too often seen as backward-looking, provincial and out of touch, plodding around in the fields while the rest of the world streams down the highway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Sex and Violence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/movies/l-disclosure-sex-and-violence-211095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I enjoyed the article on \"Disclosure\" and thought it made interesting points about the relationship between female sexuality, male fear and power.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"How Two Pianists Remade (And Upheld) a Tradition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/arts/jazz-view-how-two-pianists-remade-and-upheld-a-tradition.html","abstract":"  TRULY INNOVATIVE ARTISTS IN a given form clarify the questions that the form itself seems to be asking at the moment the innovators come along. In the 20th century, such artists have often arrived in pairs, with conceptions that seem at first to be almost diametrically opposed -- Picasso and Matisse, Joyce and Stein, Fellini and Bergman. Yet the tension between their sensibilities makes their common esthetic concerns stand out in bolder relief than they might otherwise have.   Such a pair were the pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, who together in the 1940's staked out the playing field for their instrument in what was known as modern jazz. In styles as different as Goya's was from Manet's, Powell, who died at 41 in 1966, and Monk, who died at 64 in 1982, re-evaluated the piano's relation to its European heritage and reached nearly opposite conclusions.

These records are the only window I have to that formative period, and they mark, unfortunately, the only period of my life supported by written records.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Time to Retire the Filibuster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/opinion/time-to-retire-the-filibuster.html","abstract":"  The U.S. Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest deliberative body. The greatest obstructive body is more like it. In the last session of Congress, the Republican minority invoked an endless string of filibusters to frustrate the will of the majority. This relentless abuse of a time-honored Senate tradition so disgusted Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, that he is now willing to forgo easy retribution and drastically limit the filibuster. Hooray for him.   For years Senate filibusters -- when they weren't conjuring up romantic images of Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith, passing out from exhaustion on the Senate floor -- consisted mainly of negative feats of endurance. Senator Sam Ervin once spoke for 22 hours straight. Outrage over these tactics and their ability to bring Senate business to a halt led to the current so-called two-track system, whereby a senator can hold up one piece of legislation while other business goes on as usual.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Neighbor Is Sad and Angry Over Demise of Luchow's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/nyregion/l-neighbor-is-sad-and-angry-over-demise-of-luchow-s-178095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"End Is Near for the Old Luchow's,\" reported your Dec. 25 headline. \"And the neighbors couldn't be happier,\" said your text.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"A DEATH IN JERUSALEM \nBy Kati Marton.\nPantheon, $25.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Urban Dangers Send Children Indoors to Play; A Chain of Commercial Playgrounds Is One Answer for Worried Parents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/nyregion/urban-dangers-send-children-indoors-play-chain-commercial-playgrounds-one-answer.html","abstract":"  It is the week between Christmas and New Year's.

Its residents hungering for order, the civic life of New York's neighborhoods evolved as both prickly and aggressive, amounting to a stiffening of civic resolve that sought control over the streets and an erasure of the decades-old impulse of shrugging off disorder. Hearts hardened; community meetings often turned ugly.   Feeding off new commercial life swelling in neighborhoods from SoHo to the Upper West Side, Manhattan had a crisper feel, perhaps caffeinated by the new-style coffee bars that cropped up on some streets three at a time. Huge stores took over the empty hulks that were the dreams of turn-of the-century retailers. Themes and hooks were demanded, and the rollicking permutations of capitalism sometimes took bizarre forms. Televisions turned up above urinals in restaurants. One nightclub owner decided to have an earthquake night: the place shook at midnight as Los Angeles video imagery abounded.

Neil A. Grauer, a freelance journalist and cartoonist, has provided the best to date: an appreciative, sympathetic overview of a singular talent and the often compromised life it inhabited. Neither a literary adulation (like Charles S. Holmes's biography, \"The Clocks of Columbus\") nor an irritable diminishment (like Burton Bernstein's \"Thurber: A Biography\"), REMEMBER LAUGHTER: A Life of James Thurber (University of Nebraska, $20) manages to offer a writer's life with a balance that is often lost in contemporary biography. Expedient, germane and selective, the book maintains an interest in the subject's personal life and development only to illuminate Thurber's work, which is what warranted the biography in the first place. Though Mr. Grauer necessarily relies on previous criticism, Thurber's letters and interviews with the author's few remaining associates (most of whom, alas, knew Thurber in his last two decades, when alcohol often inspired more diatribe than humor), his own opinions allow for both circumspection and conviction. Mr. Grauer fairly inventories the sources for Thurber's uncanny fictionalized memoirs as well as his later \"grumpy and misanthropic\" tone when he assumed \"the role of a nearly perpetual pallbearer for comedy.\" Throughout, Mr. Grauer does not permit a demeaning anecdote to displace the genuine accomplishments that continue to provide the greater perspective. \"Remember Laughter\" takes its title to heart, which should give readers a reason to celebrate.\nMICHAEL J.

Republicans are less united on international issues than on their domestic agenda. But critics of specific Administration policies now lead both houses and chair key committees. They have ample constitutional power to obstruct the President's agenda and advance their own. The Senate has the authority to confirm nominees and ratify treaties, and both houses can vote down or condition appropriations for everything from foreign aid and intelligence to troop deployments.    Sharper foreign policy debate can be healthy. The Administration has not performed so brilliantly that it can afford to brush off useful criticism. No great philosophical differences divide Mr. Clinton from mainstream Republicans on many issues, and both parties need to consider how to reshape U.S. policies to a changed world.

This startling evaluation deserves careful examination by politicians and Washington officials before they indiscriminately dismantle social programs that may actually have worked.    As households with working dads and stay-at-home moms became an increasingly smaller proportion of American families, social policy makers worried about the effects of divorce, illegitimacy and working mothers on student achievement. But the Rand study found that factors like parental education, household income, family size and the age of the mother when the child was born are more important than family structure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950102","headline":"On the Road to Some Intriguing Places","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/02/arts/television-review-on-the-road-to-some-intriguing-places.html","abstract":"  If the romance has gone out of travel, blame television and all those old movie travelogues.

This new hypothesis stems from geological studies of a buried crater in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, a giant scar as much as 180 miles wide that is widely believed to be the site where a huge asteroid collided with Earth just before the time of the dinosaur extinctions.
