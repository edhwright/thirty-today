Such boundary lines, of course, were drawn after the fact, and the lines are anything but straight.   Where, for example, are we to place the \"Archduke\" Trio? Its opus number (Op. 97) signals lateness, but its extraordinary generosity and sense of leisure occupies a period all its own. The \"Archduke\" came to the Mostly Mozart Festival at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday, preceded by an early Mozart Flute Quartet in C (K. 285B) and followed by the Mendelssohn E-flat Octet. The musicians included members of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Among their guests were the bright young players of the Miami String Quartet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940820","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/20/nyregion/inside-010960.html","abstract":"  F.T.C.

Under this Administration the U.S. is dominating the market for arms as no other country has in recent history. The American share of new arms deals in the third world soared to 73 percent in 1993 from 56 percent in 1992.   Given the dramatic rise, the failure to develop a policy is truly a missed opportunity. The U.S. could use its market dominance to try to get other leading producer countries to agree to restrain the arms trade. It could offer to limit its own sales in return for similar restraint from other countries, starting with the sale of the most advanced weapons to the world's most volatile region -- the Middle East.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940820","headline":"Beliefs; A messenger of the apocalypse (the end is coming in September) still enjoys her blintzes.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/20/us/beliefs-messenger-apocalypse-end-coming-september-still-enjoys-her-blintzes.html","abstract":"  It was not exactly the best of days when Eva Schwartz phoned to say that the world was going to end in September.

It was viewed then as young, innovative, forward-thinking, attracting the country's best architects and thinkers. Today, public housing is seen by many as dismal, tired, corrupt. Huge projects have deteriorated beyond habitability in many cities and are being torn down in Newark, St. Louis, Providence, R.I., and elsewhere.    Now several energetic, even charismatic local leaders are trying to bring about a renaissance in public housing. In Chicago, for example, Vince Lane, who has led the nation's second-largest housing authority since 1988, has won national attention for his efforts to revive the projects he oversees: rehabilitation programs that train and employ tenants, conversion of abandoned lakefront apartments into mixed-income housing, establishment of a private school headed by the pioneer educator Marva Collins, and aggressive police searches for illegal tenants, weapons and drugs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940820","headline":"Bridge; On some exasperating hands, the best bidding signals might be flashing amber lights.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/20/nyregion/bridge-some-exasperating-hands-best-bidding-signals-might-be-flashing-amber.html","abstract":"  There are some hands on which every bid represents a headache, and at the end of the day it is not clear what the contract should have been.

I was therefore somewhat skeptical about the lure of the Hudson's lights. They aren't as tall as most nor as famous. They aren't on puzzles or postage stamps or even in most travel books. But after recently visiting the four lighthouses open to the public, I was amply rewarded by stunning views of the river, the Palisades and the Catskills; one of the lighthouses, in Saugerties, even accommodates overnight guests.  Jeffrey's Hook   Known to millions as the \"Little Red Lighthouse\" because it is the subject of the children's classic \"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge,\" Jeffrey's Hook is the only lighthouse on Manhattan.

The critic's compositions are performed by leading orchestras, chamber musicians and singers around the country, sometimes with the composer conducting. When a new composition by this critic is presented in New York, another music critic from the paper reviews it, almost always favorably. After six years on the job, the critic wins a Pulitzer Prize, not for criticism but for composition. And far from being embarrassed, the editors of the paper boast in print of the critic's accomplishment.   Though unthinkable today, this was the situation of Virgil Thomson during his 14 years at The New York Herald Tribune. When he left the paper 40 years ago this fall, his career as composer and performer foundered for a time, and music criticism lost one of its perkiest, most provocative voices. Even those who devalue Thomson as a composer concede that he may have been the most brilliant music critic the United States has produced. Yet his appointment arose out of a singular set of circumstances that could not be duplicated today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Southwest Brooklyn Presses Its Economic Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-red-hook-gowanus-southwest-brooklyn-presses-its-economic.html","abstract":"  There are no greengrocers, no pharmacies, no bakeries in Red Hook.

The plan is too flawed to be inspiring, but a bill based on this proposal is probably the only one the Senate can pass anytime soon.   The choice, then, is between passing something like the mainstream proposal and passing no bill at all. Because the proposal would do some good and no major harm, it is worth grabbing.

I set up a small lab in the basement and there I performed my experiments. \"Performed\" is the right word. \"Experiment\" is not.

Although I broke beakers and popped little pieces of potassium into puddles of water to watch the water fly, I did occasionally manage to obey tutorial instructions as well, repeating experiments that others had long ago undertaken. My predecessors had asked their questions of nature with genuine curiosity and awaited, like eager suitors, her reply.

Crammed with photographs of some of this country's most notorious gangsters -- including Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky and John Gotti -- the book unfortunately also comes with some banal and overheated prose by Sidney Zion. Mr. Zion, the author of \"The Autobiography of Roy Cohn\" and a columnist at The Daily News, should know better. Consider the following: \"On Oct. 23, 1935, Charles (the Bug) Workman strode into a Newark chophouse and ventilated the 33-year-old Schultz with hot lead.\" Or this: \"Of course, if the Combination\" -- the name the mob called itself in its early years -- \"had been running the country in the 30's instead of just feasting on it, Hitler would have been buried in his brown shirt the first time he showed up in a Berlin beer hall. And the Japanese warlords would have been whacked out by Murder Inc. before the new moon turned on the Rising Sun.\" However, the photographs, ranging from one showing Dutch Schultz lying on a hospital gurney examining his fatal wounds to an image of the lifeless body of Abraham (Kid Twist) Reles spread out on a ledge five stories below the hotel window from which he fell (or more likely was pushed), are fascinating and sometimes chilling. And resist the temptation just to flip through \"Loyalty and Betrayal,\" looking only at the pictures -- you would miss the odd, unexplained datum that makes the book fun, like Schultz's final words: \"French Canadian bean soup.

The computer in the New Orleans regional Passport Agency, one of 13 national centers, collapsed on July 9 and 10 when someone turned off the air-conditioning, for one thing, and the work had to be dispersed to other regions. But the main cause of trauma, according to Gary Sheaffer of the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, applications for new and renewed passports have been running 23 percent ahead of last year. In 1993, 2.3 million were processed through June; this year the figure for the same period is put at 2.9 million. The total of 1993 applications, 4.2 million, itself represented a 10 percent increase over 1992.    On a hot day at the end of July, at the New York Passport Agency at 630 Fifth Avenue, which handles only people who have made appointments because of an emergency or because they are holding tickets for the next few days, the line ran half the length of the block from Fifth Avenue to Sixth. William Collins Jr., manager of the New York region, said that the increase at Fifth Avenue was greater than 23 percent, although a comparison with 1993 is not valid because he closed an office at 201 Varick Street in February and transferred the staff uptown, raising the office's capacity from 750 passports a day to 1,250. In the peak week, the week of July 4, he said, the office worked at capacity, turning out 1,250 a day. The figures are still high; on July 22, the total was 767 and on July 25, 882.  A Hard Time    So this is not an easy time to get a passport. January might have been a good time, or February perhaps. But the best-organized people seem to be disheveled this summer; among those who have told me recently that they were scurrying to get passports at the last minute are a relative, a co-worker and even an official in the Consular Affairs Bureau, all of whom neglected to check the expiration dates until the last minute. Mr. Collins's book of souvenir thank-you notes and photos shows the rich and the mighty, even influential Government employees, have had to get passports at the last minute this year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Decision Time For Empire Stores","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-fulton-ferry-decision-time-for-empire-stores.html","abstract":"  After decades of grand plans gone awry, the latest scheme for revamping a cluster of nine state-owned warehouses on the Brooklyn waterfront is fast approaching a watershed.

The hard wooden seats are filled except for the dozens of broken ones; thousands of proud parents and friends chatter in two dozen languages.

Though it sounds for all the world like some gigantic exotic instrument or the auditory equivalent of root canal, it is something more: it is the sound of the future. Two hundred tiny fiddlers are getting ready for the first half of the Elementary Music Festival at Lincoln High School Auditorium, a concert featuring the finest beginning musicians of the San Francisco Unified School District.   The disrepair in the hall is symbolic: the school district has fallen on hard times, as California continues to reel under inexorable recession. Many schools are in trouble. There is little money for new technology, special subjects or new staff. Some schools don't even have basketball rims (although in fairness, the absence of rims may have more to do with discouraging gang activity in certain areas after school). There are 10,350 students taking music lessons in the district and only 13 music teachers. Each is responsible for five or more schools, and they ride the circuit like judges of yore. Simple arithmetic says that each teacher sees about 800 students per week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"I Traded In My Grungy Flannel For the FX Channel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/arts/i-traded-in-my-grungy-flannel-for-the-fx-channel.html","abstract":"  'MR.

It was labeled \"dream-pop\" and enjoyed an early-1990's vogue in England before its trendiness wore thin. Five years later, the sound is familiar; groups like the Cranberries have cleared it up and made hits. But at Manhattan Center on Thursday night, Lush had budged only slightly.   Songs from Lush's new album, \"Split\" (4 A.D./Reprise), floated and kicked, with the voices of Miki Berenyi and Emma Anderson still blurred by guitar overtones. Yet the new tunes were slightly more down-to-earth than early songs like \"De-Luxe\" and \"Sweetness and Light.\" Lush has moved pop elements -- guitar hooks, vocal melodies, lyrics about love and longing -- a little closer to the foreground, and it has brought more variety to its recent songs. \"Hypocrite\" and \"Blackout\" verged on punk-rock; \"Light From a Distant Star,\" with recorded tinkling bells, was a folky elegy.

Its two core principles are yang and yin, symbolizing the dualities of light and dark, sky and earth, male and female. Taoist texts teach that both nature and society seek balance, and that interfering with this natural arrangement can bring unhappy consequences.   Chinese society is rediscovering this today. As The Times's Philip Shenon reported last week, the balance between male and female has been skewed. Under Government pressure to limit families to one child each, driven by tradition that favors boys, helped by ultrasound and readily available abortions, Chinese families have been messing with Mother Nature in an effort to make sure their one child is a boy. The result: a stark shortage of women of marriageable age, and a lot of lonely young men.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940822","headline":"Ottawa Journal; The Clock Turns Back To Lincoln Vs.

On Saturday night at Roseland, two heavy-metal bands, Helmet and the Rollins Band, acknowledged their kinship with and debts to jazz, in much the same way that rappers have been self-consciously integrating their own jazz roots into their music.   Helmet opened its set with an agitated version of \"Beautiful Love,\" a Victor Young melody that has become a jazz standard, and ended its show by playing recordings of Thelonious Monk. In between, the Manhattan-based quartet added more subtle jazz influences to its precise heavy-metal grind. Page Hamilton, who studied jazz guitar at the Manhattan School of Music, played clearly mapped modal solos that approached the energy and strength of John Coltrane, an influence Mr. Hamilton often cites.
