But he tarnished that reputation last week by pushing a number of trade-closing amendments through his committee.   The committee was voting on the Administration's proposed legislation to institute the Uruguay Round trade pact, which the U.S. signed with over 100 other nations in April in Marrakech, Morocco. The Senate Finance Committee takes up the legislation today. The most controversial issue concerns \"anti-dumping\" statutes, which govern how the U.S. will retaliate against countries that export goods at unfairly low prices -- for example, prices below the exporter's manufacturing cost.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940727","headline":"Across the Spectrum Of Dance in France","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/arts/critic-s-notebook-across-the-spectrum-of-dance-in-france.html","abstract":"  In July it seems there are more tourists than Parisians in Paris, American tourists especially. So it was appropriate that the San Francisco Ballet was booked as the final dance attraction at the premier dance forum in town, the grand and storied Palais Garnier opera house. The San Franciscans finished their engagement on July 10, and on July 17 the Palais Garnier was closed for renovation and won't reopen until February 1996.   On the surface this is a typically eclectic American company, with a diversity of style reflected in its two programs here. Still, George Balanchine remains the father of classical dance in the United States, and the Balanchine connection in San Francisco is especially strong, with two longtime New York City Ballet dancers as artistic directors: Lew Christensen, who died in late 1984, and Helgi Tomasson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940727","headline":"A Film Hit and a Star Do Wonders for 'Gump'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/movies/book-notes-a-film-hit-and-a-star-do-wonders-for-gump.html","abstract":"  Before it was an enormously successful movie whose sentimentality charmed audiences (and irritated many critics), \"Forrest Gump\" was just a novel, and not a very well-known one.

The department said it would move to take control of Newark's schools and gave city officials 20 days to defend themselves in court. Newark vows a fight, and indeed has offered its own set of remedies. But there is ample evidence to support aggressive state intervention to save its largest school district.    Newark schools have consistently failed to meet state certification standards instituted in 1984. A 1988 law allowed the state to take over failing schools, which it has already done in Jersey City and Paterson, the second- and third-largest districts. But while the state has conducted extensive investigations and applied pressure in the past, Newark schools have not improved.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940727","headline":"Higher Raise Is Provided For M.T.A.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/27/nyregion/higher-raise-is-provided-for-mta.html","abstract":"  The tentative contract reached between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its unionized employees would give bus and subway workers a bigger wage increase than other municipal unions have received recently in return for modest work-rule changes, officials said yesterday.

There is no point in reading or writing such a book if you are not a fan, and Warren G. Harris is a purposeful, besotted and occasionally craven one. He tells us that \"Audrey Hepburn,\" his latest celebrity bio, really began when he was a 17-year-old usher at Loew's Valencia Theater in Jamaica, Queens, and saw \"Roman Holiday\" 10 times in one week. Loew's Valencia became an evangelical church. Mr. Harris became a hard-working celebrity evangelist, turning out texts like \"Lucy and Desi,\" \"Gable and Lombard\" and \"Natalie and R. J.,\" and spreading the gospel of revelation and adoration. \"Audrey Hepburn\" is filled with semi-religious chapter titles like \"A Nun in Africa,\" and \"Tending Her Gardens,\" alongside fairy-tale titles like \"Ballerina to Showgirl\" and \"Stardom Beckons.\" This tone worked very nicely in her movies, but applied to her fairly straightforward life, it grows wearing very quickly.

But this year the House Appropriations Committee chopped the Pentagon's budget for research at universities by 50 percent -- from $1.8 billion to about $900 million -- and the House went along with it.   The rationale was that, with defense budgets shrinking, defense research had to shrink too. But some critics think the real reason was pique -- that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, angered by attacks on its earmarking of funds for projects in members' home districts, chose these cuts to show the mainstream universities and their Congressional champions who's boss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940728","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/nyregion/c-corrections-785547.html","abstract":"  A credit line in Science Times on Tuesday for a drawing of a reception hall of a Roman villa where a fifth-century cemetery for infants has been excavated misspelled the artist's surname.

Now it is up to Congress to try to repair the damage. It can begin by passing legislation that would re-link tariff rates for certain Chinese goods to minimum human rights standards.

Partly because the  festival has always offered these kinds of pairings, and partly because the programming often did not match the announced concept, this effort came in for some derision. So this year Lincoln Center dreamed up a few more focused themes, one of which -- Vienna, circa 1784 -- is being explored this week at Avery Fisher Hall. The final installments are tonight and tomorrow evening.         You may be wondering, what kind of theme is 1784? Good question. It was hardly a watershed, politically or musically. Mozart, then 28, was fairly prolific; when wasn't he?

Now that's a miracle,  at least in the scheme of this movie, a sometimes awkward mix of savviness and schmaltz.         The other miracle is that the two stars of \"It Could Happen to You\" keep it sailing over a script that is often as predictable and flat as the movie's new title. In one of the brighter touches, Charlie (Mr. Cage) is introduced carrying a blind man across the street and delivering a baby on a bus, presumably all in  a day's work.

Hesketh made sure the Yankees would not snatch two victories in one day by depriving them of anything but two  hits into the eighth inning in Boston's 1-0 triumph.

One is the blocklong sign adorned with brightly colored chairs that shouts \"Everybody\" in black capital letters on a taxicab-yellow billboard between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and seems as much an advertisement for some mysterious product as an exhortation to community.

Jesse Marcel, an Army Air Force intelligence officer at a base near Roswell, N.M., where the debris from some sort of crash is at first reported to be from an unidentified object. (It makes the sheep nervous.)  But before you can say flying saucer, Marcel, effectively underplayed by Kyle MacLachlan, becomes the fall guy as the Washington establishment undertakes what may be the most far-fetched cover-up in the history of cover-up movies.

The screenwriter Caroline Thompson (\"Edward Scissorhands,\" \"The Secret Garden\"), making her directorial debut, takes a cue from Anna Sewell's well-loved 1877 novel (which is subtitled \"The Autobiography  of a Horse\") and goes well beyond that book's horse-centric point of view.         So Ms. Thompson affords her four-legged hero extreme sensitivity, especially  by horse standards. Black Beauty is heard cataloguing his feelings in exquisite  detail. With a thoroughness to rival David Copperfield's, he even begins his story at the moment of birth. Later on, he falls in love, dreams about his mother, rhapsodizes about oats and complains bitterly about wearing a harness with a bit.

At the  same time, it has allayed some fears that lenders will become more aggressive about foreclosing on defaulting co-ops. \n\n     The fears are that lenders, who have been loosening their underwriting standards for co-ops, may tighten them again. On the other hand, the decision in the closely watched case has also made it less likely that lenders will find it  more profitable to foreclose rather than renegotiate terms when a co-op defaults on its underlying mortgage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940729","time":"1994-07-29
