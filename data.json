Only the most obviously disreputable of American imports and revivals fail to earn critical raves here, and on occasion local versions of New York shows are proclaimed superior to the originals. During the 1980's, this was most famously the case with Richard Eyre's staging of \"Guys and Dolls\" and Cameron Mackintosh's upbeat revision of Stephen Sondheim's \"Follies,\" though American visitors could see that both productions were far from fluent in Broadwayese. In \"Guys and Dolls,\" Damon Runyon's mugs sometimes spoke with Southern accents and tapped like Bojangles.   So it was with skepticism that I approached the new production of the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein \"Carousel,\" which opened last weekend to ecstatic reviews and turn-away crowds at the Royal National Theater, the site of the Eyre \"Guys and Dolls.\" But for once the wild enthusiasm may be an understatement. This is without question the most revelatory, not to mention the most moving, revival I've seen of any Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. The National has recently found startling new ways of looking at the dramas of Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller under both Peter Hall's and Mr. Eyre's leadership, and now it proves just as imaginative in sweeping away decades of cliches from an American musical classic of the same period.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19921217","headline":"Fischer Said to Plan a 2d Match in Yugoslavia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/17/world/fischer-said-to-plan-a-2d-match-in-yugoslavia.html","abstract":"  A day after he was indicted in Washington for violating international economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, Bobby Fischer, the former world chess champion, was reported by a Belgrade newspaper today to be planning another match in Yugoslavia in March.

Jagr picked up a deflected pass from Mario Lemieux in the right circle and beat Philadelphia goaltender Tommy Soderstrom, who was making his National Hockey League debut. The winning goal was Jagr's league-leading seventh of the season. He has 14 goals over all. Pittsburgh has won five of its last six and is unbeaten in its last 11 against the Flyers (8-0-3). Philadelphia's sixth straight loss tied the club record set in 1970. Kevin Dineen had given Philadelphia a 4-4 tie at 5:10 of the third period when he skated in front of the Pittsburgh net and lifted a backhander that beat Tom Barrasso. The goal also snapped an 11-game scoreless drought for Dineen.

The Canadiens, who lost by 5-1 to Quebec at Montreal on Wednesday, retained first place in the Adams Division, 4 points ahead of the second-place Nordiques. In the wild first period, the teams combined for 9 goals on 18 shots: Montreal took a 4-0 lead, Quebec rallied to make the score 4-3, and the Canadiens added two more goals to lead by 6-3. Montreal stopped Quebec's five-game unbeaten streak and also earned its first victory over the Nordiques in five regular-season games since last Dec. 26. (AP) Blackhawks 5, Jets, 1: Ed Belfour ran his unbeaten streak to seven games as Chicago remained unbeaten for the 11th straight time at home by beating Winnipeg. Belfour stopped 29 shots to extend his streak to 6-0-1. The Blackhawks' penalty-killers shut down the Jets on all 10 of their power plays.

His 1991 film, \"Scream of Stone,\" begins with the hilarious absurdity of indoor mountain-climbing as a televised sport. In a studio, two world-class mountaineers literally climb the walls, with Donald Sutherland giving the play-by-play. Soon a middle-aged champion and his arrogant young challenger agree to race to the top of a killer mountain in Patagonia. Brad Dourif, as the most space-shot climber of all, pops in and insists he has already been there. \"I dedicated my climb to Mae West,\" he says. \"They say she's dead, but she's not. She owns a beauty parlor.\" He gets the last word with the film's funny final turn.   Although it has dull patches and laughable moments of seriousness, this new film is a link to the dazzling old Herzog, who seemed to have disappeared.

The 16-nation body did not indicate how it would help enforce the ban, but Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that NATO was preparing contingency plans to enforce the no-flights zone and that the United States was prepared to provide aircraft in such an operation.   Options ranged from overflights to what Mr. Eagleburger called \"more muscular measures.\" He acknowledged that if the ban is enforced, it could put United Nations troops at risk of retaliation and that it was a \"possibility\" that they might be forced to withdraw, at least temporarily.  Warning to U.N.    The NATO decision came as the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, warned that United Nations troops in Bosnia may be attacked if Western nations attempt to enforce the ban on flights.   The Serbs are reported to have violated the ban on flights 225 times since it was imposed in October. But there is no proof that they have resumed combat missions.   NATO has already contributed personnel and equipment to the United Nations peackeeping operation in the Balkans, and its ships are in the Adriatic, helping to enforce a blockade. NATO reconnaissance aircraft are providing data on violations of the flight ban.   On another issue, Mr. Eagleburger warned Ukraine that its relationship with the United States will suffer if it continues to delay ratification of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the strategic arms reduction treaty slashing the arsenals of nuclear weapons in the United States and the former Soviet republics. The Ukrainian Foreign Minsiter, Anatoly Zlenko, told Mr. Eagleburger earlier in the week that the Kiev Parliament would not take up the issue until January at the earliest.   Mr. Eagleburger said he made clear during the meeting that the United States \"is not particularly happy with the delays,\" adding that he expected \"ratification and without reservations,\" and if progress is delayed much longer it will \"inevitably have an impact\" on the two countries' relations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Council Backs New Board To Review Police Conduct","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/nyregion/council-backs-new-board-to-review-police-conduct.html","abstract":"  The City Council voted overwhelmingly last night to establish an all-civilian agency to investigate police misconduct, ending for now a racially charged debate that has polarized the city several times since the idea was first proposed in the 1960's.

The strike, which began on Monday, could threaten the Polish economic recovery, which is gathering strength from consumer-oriented industries. Miners, once among the highest-paid workers in the Communist system, have been among the losers in the transition to capitalism. The walkout is also a challenge to Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka, who earned an 80 percent approval rating after facing down automobile workers and copper miners who struck in the summer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Board Chief Assails Aides To Fernandez","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/nyregion/board-chief-assails-aides-to-fernandez.html","abstract":"  H.

BREAST CANCER IS RELEASED   A long-awaited Federal report has concluded that the high incidence of breast cancer on Long Island can be explained by the known risk factors for the disease, like the Island's larger Jewish population. Jewish women have a higher risk of breast cancer. But the report was harshly criticized by the Long Island woman who served on the panel that drafted it. Page 29.  PSYCHIATRIST CALLS WOMAN 'BEWILDERED'   A psychiatrist testified at the Glen Ridge, N.J., sex assault trial that an \"ordinary\" woman would have fled or voiced alarm when a sexual encounter became painful and that the mentally retarded young woman who remained in a room with the four young men accused of assaulting her was unable to understand or exercise her right to refuse to engage in sex.
