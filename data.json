Dance fuses past and present for peoples as diverse as the Aymara in Bolivia, where youngsters still perform the Qhashwa on frosty nights to protect the potato crop, and the Kiowa in Oklahoma, where veterans of Operation Desert Storm perform dances at meetings of the Black Legs Society. Unfortunately, the accompanying essays, written by scholars and curators, fail to match the impact of the photographs and presume a working knowledge of American Indian cosmology and history. The authors tend to dwell on esoteric matters, like variations in costume.

Every now and then, the works of man -- a red-brick 19th-century factory, a demure railroad station, an isolated house or dock -- disappear for a long stretch, and you see only rippling water, the rock-cliff Palisades and forests. Gulls bob on the river's surface and, in season, swans alight and preen. Recently, thanks to the continuing battle against pollution, ospreys have been sighted. \n\nIf it is easy to imagine the river Henry Hudson saw, it is even easier to envision life along its banks a hundred or even 200 years ago.

This reawakening is taking place against the backdrop of Cracow's immutable strengths: an old town of narrow cobbled streets and 60 churches, the Jagiellonian University, which counts Copernicus and Pope John Paul II among its alumni, and the 13th-century Wawel royal castle, a moody, dark bulk of fortressed walls, onion domes and spires atop a limestone hill. Complementing Cracow's architecture is its music. The variety of excellent music being performed makes Cracow more than just another museum town.

From the minute you pick it up, it seems to eat money, starting with surcharges for calls to \"free\" 800 numbers all the way down to charges for calls you try to make but go unanswered. In many cases, letting a child into the minibar would be cheaper.   The worst situation appears to be dialing a long-distance call, with the toll to be charged to your room bill. Even when you dial every digit yourself, it will probably be billed at the higher operator-assisted rate, and there will be a surcharge beyond that, which may be as high as 50 percent of the cost of the call. Sometimes the surcharge is by the call, sometimes by the minute, sometimes a combination. Using a credit card linked to your regular phone company, either to charge the call or to call collect, will get you around this.

Who'd have thought that these are exactly the qualities that would make the Broadway version a smash in 1993? While it was a huge commercial success, the original \"Tommy\" has always seemed overblown, its pencil-thin story -- of a deaf, dumb and blind boy who \"sure plays a mean pinball\" -- barely able to support its music.   On the Great White Way, however, this flaw becomes an asset, since elemental rock needs to be inflated -- expanded, arranged, orchestrated -- to fill a Broadway stage with sufficient drama, pacing and glitz. The new cast album, entitled \"The Who's 'Tommy' \" (RCA, 09026-61874-2; 2 CD's and cassettes), documents the ways the director Des McAnuff's stage version has shrewdly reinterpreted Pete Townshend's creation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"FOCUS;\nLife After City Subsidies in Cincinnati","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/realestate/focus-life-after-city-subsidies-in-cincinnati.html","abstract":"In a dilapidated three-story town house vacant since the 50's, a local developer is betting $175,000 in borrowed money that a neighborhood in the process of renewal will continue to attract people to city life.\n\nThe developer, Paul Cmil, is hoping to restore the mid-19th century brick house and rent three apartments for $500 a month in what has been a rundown section just northwest of the city's downtown.

There's no bronze. There's no bronze-tinted glass. There's no Four Seasons, with its bronzed and burnished clientele.

And unlike Seagram's rows of neatly calibrated window shades, the windows at 860-880 are dressed with heavy curtains, randomly bunched against the sun.   It may take a while, in other words, to register that Miesian refinement did not depend on sumptuous materials or polished perfection. It required clarity of purpose, 3,000 years of geometry, and a good eye. No. 860-880 has the rawness of invention. This is Mies fresh out of the box or, more accurately, fresh into it.

But its pairing of 19th-century African \"power objects\" with the work of a contemporary African-American artist implicitly raises questions about the relationship of Western and non-Western art that the exhibition comes nowhere near answering.  The show, which runs through Jan. 2, includes more than 30 carved wooden figures called \"minkisi\" (min-KEY-see, roughly translated as \"things that do things\"). They were made a century ago by the people of Kongo (an ancient territory that covered parts of present-day Congo, Angola and Zaire). Wrapped in fabric or bristling with nails, these objects are credited with the power to change human lives. The last gallery is devoted to work by Renee Stout, a young Washington artist whose sculptures adapt many superficial features of these figures.    Superficiality is the problem. For although \"Astonishment and Power\" suggests a continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today, it reveals instead how tenuous this connection can be if crucial cultural differences are ignored.  In fact, the most satisfying way for a viewer to approach \"Astonishment and Power\" is to treat the Kongo objects, carefully mounted and documented by Wyatt MacGaffey, an anthropologist, as an exhibition in itself. Although most of the minkisi (\"nkisi\" in the singular) in the show are human figures, they can also take the form of clay pots, leaf-wrapped packets or stitched cloth pouches. Once the nkisi is implanted with symbolic medicines -- ashes, roots, seeds, crushed bone, or dirt taken from graves -- it is considered to be inhabited by a spirit whose energies can be activated, often for a fee, by the insertion of nails or metal blades into the object itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Rama Atassi, Souheil Hajjar","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/weddings-rama-atassi-souheil-hajjar.html","abstract":"  Rama Atassi, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. M.

The ones about Herbert von Karajan are singular in that almost every punch line makes the same essential point. Here's a sample: Karajan goes to the undertaker and wants to look at coffins -- something simple and economical, please. The undertaker interprets this in his own way and shows various models of fine material and elegant design, each of which is rejected. Finally the conductor insists on being shown simple wooden coffins and selects one. Undertaker, pained: \"But tell me, Herr von Karajan, why, for such an important occasion, should you economize?\" Karajan, calm: \"And why should I spend a fortune when I'm only staying three days?\"   In fact Karajan was not so trusting about resurrection; he was more like the ancient pharaohs, providing elaborately for his posthumous comfort. The central project of his last decade was to document on film, for eventual release on laser disk, the core repertory he had conducted and recorded so often during his remarkable career. (It was typical of his confidence that he conceived this series on such a grand scale before the commercial viability of the laser disk had even been tested.) An enormous first installment is now available from Sony Classical, dominating the orchestral video market by sheer quantity. But the vagaries of the recording industry have provided the series with fierce competition: Karajan's own earlier videos, issued in roughly equivalent quantity by Deutsche Grammophon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"U.S.-Japan Currency Adjustments Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/opinion/l-us-japan-currency-adjustments-work-290593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Karel van Wolferen makes two egregious errors in \"Japan's Big Chance -- and Clinton's\" (Op-Ed, July 6).

More than 30 years later, a film adaptation by Mr. Foote won an Oscar for Geraldine Page.    Clearly, Mr. Foote provided a bountiful role for an actress. Carrie Watts, debilitated by the bickering and the pettiness that have crept into her life, yearns to recover her dignity before dying.

The esthetic of Totalism is inspired by Minimalism's use of repetition and by the instrumentation and styles of rock, pop and world music, but it also aims for the larger structures and more elaborate harmonies of the classical tradition. Unlike much other recent downtown music, Totalist music is totally scored, not improvised.

That this actor and the large company around him have brought off a show this fine, not to mention energetic, during a virulent heat wave may in fact constitute valor above and beyond the call of duty.   The director is Michael Rudman, an American who has mainly worked in England (with the prominent exception of the Dustin Hoffman \"Death of a Salesman\" on Broadway). His approach to this darkest of Shakespearean comedies is feather light: as he also did at the National Theater in London a dozen years ago, Mr. Rudman has switched the play's setting from an intrigue-filled Vienna to a sunny Caribbean island of the 1940's. The endlessly fascinating psychological and moral shadings of the piece vanish with Vienna, but the comic interludes, which are usually neglected in weightier stagings, have rarely been funnier.

They decided that giant pumps at the water treatment plant were still too damp from floods a week ago to be safely started.   The people of Des Moines, who have been without running water for a week, had thought they would start to get water back on Monday. But L. D. McMullen, the chief executive of the Des Moines Water Works, said that high humidity had prevented the electric pumps from drying properly. The result was a postponement of the city's plan to begin pumping water tonight and to have the entire system back in operation by Thursday or Friday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930719","headline":"What They're Reading","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/19/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, director of Germany's Allensbach public opinion research center, is reading a book of poems by Hilde Domin and \"Engel,\" an anthology of literary encounters with angels. \"It contains centuries of experience with ang","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930719","headline":"Politics Can Change Rapidly but Economics Can't","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/19/world/politics-can-change-rapidly-but-economics-can-t.html","abstract":"  When President Clinton came here two weeks ago, he sensed a historic opportunity and pressed more aggressively than any of his predecessors for a breakup of the collusive forces that have made Japan such a frustrating market for United States companies.

But in the end he yielded to fierce opposition and simply modified the ban, ending its worst abuses but forcing homosexuals to hide their private lives if they wish to serve.   Even so, the policy moves in the right direction and is probably the best that can be wrung from a Congress that is unwilling to go further than the Joint Chiefs of Staff will accept.

Darwin argues that natural selection favors any gene that increases the number of offspring an organism produces. But a child shares only half of its genes with the mother; the other half comes from the father. As a result, the evolutionary interests of a mother and her offspring can be different. The fetus benefits by extracting as much nutrition as it can use from the woman. She, however, must strike a balance between nourishing the fetus and keeping resources for herself and her future children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930720","headline":"After 3 Years, Bulls Finally Sign Kukoc","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/20/sports/pro-basketball-after-3-years-bulls-finally-sign-kukoc.html","abstract":"  After three years of courting him, the Chicago Bulls finally landed Toni Kukoc yesterday, signing the 6-foot-11-inch guard known as the \"Magic Johnson of Europe\" to a multiyear contract.
