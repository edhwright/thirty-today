As both Clint Black and Wynonna Judd, two of country music's biggest stars, demonstrated at Radio City Music Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the music has expanded and modernized its vocabulary over the last decade without losing its soul or its sense of identity.   If most country music still directs itself to white, rural working people, it has also become increasingly suburbanized and has assimilated many of the stylistic elements of old-time rock-and-roll, a genre that has come to seem quaint to a younger, post-punk rock audience. And unlike rock and hip-hop, country music reveres traditional standards of songwriting craft and celebrates polished voices, instrumental virtuosity and ensemble teamwork. If its songs are often formulaic, they are unfailingly and reassuringly tuneful.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/style/chronicle-417393.html","abstract":"  DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR., who still looks like the dashing swashbuckler he played in his movie career despite his 83 years, was cited on Wednesday in San Francisco by CARE, the relief organization, for his naval service in World War II and his post-war efforts in delivering CARE packages to starving war victims.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-91843457153.html","abstract":"1943: Roosevelt's 'Gosh'","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"U.S. Defines Mental Illness As Standard for Treatment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/us/us-defines-mental-illness-as-standard-for-treatment.html","abstract":"  The Federal Government has officially defined \"serious mental illness\" as it prepares for the first national estimate of the number of people suffering from a condition that keeps them from leading a normal life.

Written in 1965, five years before Mishima's ritual suicide, the play is about the Marquis de Sade \"as seen through women's eyes.\" De Sade never appears on stage, but we hear in grotesque and sometimes glowing detail about the paradoxes of his perversity.   Mishima, who evidently identified with de Sade, paired opposites: the sacred and the profane, the beautiful and the horrific. The greater truth about the character of de Sade is that he is whatever the women and the world want him to be. For one of the women he is a lovable vampire. At the end of the play there is the suggestion that his decadence has not only destroyed women but may also have contributed to the French Revolution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"Byrd Stalks November Ghosts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/sports/football-byrd-stalks-november-ghosts.html","abstract":"  As the car entered the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan, heading toward Giants Stadium, Dennis Byrd felt a tinge of excitement and nervousness.

No need for a license, insurance, registration, identification, nothing except a keen sense of maneuvering. The city hasn't got a clue how to enforce the law on bicyclists.

Soliciting public comments, as we have begun to do, is hardly censorious. Indeed, it is democratic. It is a stretch of common sense to imagine that asking for the views of the public will stifle creativity and lead to \"insipid programs that offend no one.\"   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has a special obligation to facilitate strict adherence to balance and objectivity in controversial programming. This is not new. Congress wrote it into law in 1967, when it created the agency. The Public Telecommunications Act of 1992 simply reaffirms one of the pillars of Federal support for public broadcasting as we know it. By recognizing the corporation's accountability for these issues, it strengthens rather than dilutes our role as a heat shield between creative independence and political pressure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"Managing the Waste Stream","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/opinion/managing-the-waste-stream.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration's decision to freeze new construction of hazardous-waste incinerators buys valuable time to bring reason to a politically emotional issue.

The financing is aimed at reducing sharply the amount of domestic credits issued by the Central Bank and the inflation they cause, Russian officials and Western diplomats say.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"Jerusalem Journal; More Generals Switching From Bullets to Ballots","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/world/jerusalem-journal-more-generals-switching-from-bullets-to-ballots.html","abstract":"  One day in March, Maj.

As they testified in a trial over whether Dr. Jeffries had been illegally removed from his post as chairman of the university's black studies department, the officials also made it obvious how little scrutiny they had given the department in 20 years.    When the jury sided with Dr. Jeffries, awarding him $400,000 in punitive damages last week, some jurors said the university did not make a convincing case about the shortcomings of Dr. Jeffries and his department. They decided that the only reason he had been removed from his post was to punish him for a speech he delivered in Albany in 1991. The speech caused a widespread outcry because of Dr. Jeffries's contentions, including his comments that Jews and the Mafia conspired to put down blacks in Hollywood films. No Clear Idea of Standards    The jury's verdict suggests a disturbing notion about those whose job it was to oversee Dr. Jeffries's department: that officials did not have a clear idea of what standards to use to judge its work and that of its faculty, and more importantly, they did not care enough to notice how it was changing or developing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"New Jersey Q & A: Miles Lerman;\nMaking a Holocaust Memorial a Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-miles-lerman-making-a-holocaust-memorial-a-reality.html","abstract":"ONE day in 1941, while he was in a Nazi labor camp near Lvov, his Polish birthplace, Miles Lerman witnessed an atrocity that still haunts him more than five decades later.

During the teens, 20's and 30's -- the golden age of the European poster -- a variety of English businesses, even the Government itself, employed some of the finest graphic designers and painters to promote products, services and ideas. This was not the hard sell we have come to expect from advertising agencies today; quite often the works were masterpieces of painterly form and typographic elegance. One corporation, Shell Oil, stood out for its inventiveness. THE SHELL POSTER BOOK (Godine, paper, $19.95), a collection of the company's finest posters from 1920 to 1952, shows that good design was good business. The company's poster tradition can be credited to one employee, Jack Beddington, who, despite lack of experience, was placed in charge of advertising after he complained that the company's promotions were mundane. Under his leadership, Shell's ads were transformed from crass and copy-driven to elegant image-dominated posters with catchy phrases. Styles ranged from the rectilinear Art Moderne renderings depicting speed by Tom Purvis, to modern country landscapes by Graham Sutherland, Paul Nash and Vanessa Bell, to the Surrealist fantasies of E. McKnight Kauffer and Zero (Hans Schleger). There were also frequent experiments with Cubist, Expressionist and cartoon styles by veteran and neophyte artists alike. By the early 50's the quality of the posters had begun to decline, a situation caused as much by the passing of the great artists as by changes in corporate priorities. As slick as later advertising became, however, it does not surpass the individuality and originality of the posters produced when Shell was fueled by art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Putney, Vt.;\nApartments For the Elderly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/realestate/northeast-notebook-putney-vt-apartments-for-the-elderly.html","abstract":"DEVELOPERS in this rural southeastern Vermont town of 2,352 people have created a 28-unit complex, Putney Meadows Elderly Housing, that will serve both the elderly and the handicapped of any age.

Following the victory of the Russians over the Turks in 1878, Bismarck and Disraeli organized the congress to \"revise\" the Treaty of San Stefano.

Each week they pored over that Hollywood film maker's instruction manual, Weekly Variety (which arrived by ship months after publication), and eventually divined that action films starring Chuck Norris were the keys to success. The aspiring film makers -- 23-year-old Renny Harlin and 22-year-old Marcus Selin -- cooked up an adventure story, had it translated into English and sent the script to someone in America who represented Chuck Norris.   A few weeks later, Mr. Norris wrote back, saying he'd be happy to star in their movie. That was in 1983. The result, \"Born American,\" a cold-war thriller about vacationing Americans who stray across the Finnish-Russian border, was released in 1986 and featured not Mr. Norris but his son Mike. The producer was Mr. Selin, and the director was Mr. Harlin, both of whom had relocated to Hollywood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Coins of the Realm (Hers and Other Folks')","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/style/coins-coins-of-the-realm-hers-and-other-folks.html","abstract":"  WHILE the sun may have finally set on the British Empire, it certainly won't set on the countries that have issued commemorative coins honoring the 40th year of Elizabeth II's reign.

The status is given by market forces and political priorities; the aura of grandeur is the result of a cultural con job. The two approaches have the same effect: everything is seen as mere entertainment.   There is nothing like spending a few days with Beethoven's piano sonatas to clear the mind of such notions. Recently, Carnegie Hall presented the pianist Alfred Brendel, one of the foremost interpreters of Beethoven, in a three-day workshop; he was assisted by the musicologist William Kinderman, whose own musical and intellectual facility was breathtaking. In their discussions of these 32 compositions, the long-abused word \"masterpiece\" was gradually restored to life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Sports of The Times; A Bill for Boxing That Is Long Overdue","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-a-bill-for-boxing-that-is-long-overdue.html","abstract":"  While boxing's eyes were on last night's Riddick Bowe-Jesse Ferguson heavyweight title fight, its ears were listening for a Congressional roll call.

More often than not you read that a studio executive or someone close to a production \"spoke on the condition of anonymity.\" Because I speak to the press on the record, I expect to be quoted accurately in return. When James Greenberg contacted me about his article on Kit Culkin and his child-star son Macauley Culkin  [ \"A 'Stage Father' Flexes His New Muscles,\" April 25 ] , I told him I wasn't interested in \"Culkin-bashing.\" He assured me that that wasn't the intent of his article. Not!   My quotes were conveniently lopped off halfway through to meet the needs of Mr. Greenberg's article.  Some clarifications follow:   In the article I am quoted as saying, \"Mack has not changed, but Kit has -- absolutely.\" I had gone on to say that as a father and manager Kit has done whatever he feels is necessary to protect his child.   In regard to the notion that \"Mr. Culkin's methods may prove damaging to his son's career,\" I went on to say that he and his wife, Pat, must be doing something right because Mack and his siblings are the same great kids I met six years ago.   While preparing to direct the play \"Sam, I Am,\" I indeed \"recall being at the screaming end of Mr. Culkin's phone calls,\" but both the playwright and I were as disappointed as all the other artists involved when we canceled the production.   Minor points, you say? Yes. The shortened quote under the photograph of Mack may make for a splashy caption, but is no more accurate than the headlines we see in grocery-store tabloids.

J. better. He had position, his hand was in Michael's face and Wilkins had even briefly knocked the ball loose an instant before. But there was Jordan, with his body canted backward at 45 degrees, throwing up a shot that would have been ridiculed if attempted by anyone else -- at least, until it whispered through the laces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Great Men and Tiny Bubbles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/books/great-men-and-tiny-bubbles.html","abstract":"    FOR GOD, COUNTRY AND COCA-COLA The Unauthorized History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It.

Unfortunately, there was a heavy downside to our trip because of the prevalence of smoking. First, not only do most restaurants not have nonsmoking sections, they will often move smokers to an adjacent table even in a near-empty establishment.

It will feature great individual players like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Patrick Ewing. It will feature two teams that are coached superbly and have relentless defenses. And the drama will provide long-lasting memories. The Eastern Conference finals between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls has been anticipated and analyzed. But finally, starting with Game 1 this afternoon at Madison Square Garden, the plot will unfold. Many factors will determine the winner of the four-of-seven-game series. But as the matchup gets under way, here's a look at five areas that will greatly determine which team goes to the championship finals, and which team goes home.    1. THE JORDON FACTOR:    Jordan's greatness goes beyond his ability to score, to defend and to levitate. Jordan has a level of pride and intensity similar to two other great players of his era - Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. The thought of not winning a championship disgusts Jordan. He thinks of the title as his property now, much the way a boxer protects the title belt.

The choice of the United States Military Academy Band is especially apt as Memorial Day approaches: as the senior musical unit of the American Army, the Concert Band has appeared at many historic events (including the return home of the Iran hostages), given joint concerts with the American Symphony and the New York Philharmonic, been conducted by such legendary maestros as Arturo Toscanini and Leopold Stokowski.

A thousand of the novelist's pals polished off 100 cases of fine Cuban rum (courtesy of Fidel Castro), while dancing till dawn to an even more intoxicating import -- music by a selection of Colombian bands that Mr. Garcia Marquez himself had flown in for the occasion. Until that momentous night, the irrepressible rhythms of Colombia -- porro, cumbia, mapale, vallenato and gaita -- had rarely, if ever, been heard outside of Latin America.   Next Sunday's concert at Madison Square Garden, \"Pa' Colombia con Polito\" (\"To Colombia With Polito\"), which will have as its host the New York radio personality Polito Vega, promises to be another landmark in the history of Colombian music. The debut of important Colombian artists like Grupo Niche, Orquestra Guayacan and Lisandro Meza in New York's largest and most visible concert venue is testimony to the impact that Colombian musicians are making in a Latin music business once dominated by Nuyorican and Puerto Rican salsa.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Maybe the Sky Isn't His Limit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/sports/pro-basketball-maybe-the-sky-isn-t-his-limit.html","abstract":"  Down on the floor of the Chicago Bulls' suburban practice facility was that familiar lean fellow, star of courts, videos and commercials, shaved head gleaming under the gym lights, legs muscular and veiny as a thoroughbred's, in red shirt and shorts, shooting graceful jump shots left-handed.

That is not a comment I make lightly; neither is it a nod to Jefferson's 250th birthday last month, an event that deserves to be celebrated with honesty rather than hyperbole. It is merely an observation that comes from 25 years of looking at buildings in this country, and realizing how few of them reach the transcendent. Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater? Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building? Louis Kahn's Salk Institute? It is not a long list, and Jefferson's work heads it.   Jefferson's legacy has not always brought great architecture in its wake; it has intimidated more than it has inspired, though one newly completed addition to this campus offers tremendous promise. Surely of all of the truly great pieces of architecture in this country, the University of Virginia is the most American, the one that best embodies our tendency both to look back at other cultures and to try to make something that is entirely our own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"She Doesn't Sing the Blues Anymore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/she-doesnt-sing-the-blues-anymore.html","abstract":"WHEN Sun Meidia decided to resume her career as a jazz vocalist after 19 years away from show business, she took a direct approach.

The new plan, if it can be implemented, is less than adequate but better than nothing.   The plan would station some 15,000 European and Canadian ground troops under a U.N. flag to deter Bosnian Serb attacks against six U.N.-designated safe havens. That would concentrate outside forces where they are most needed -- in the beleaguered cities of Sarajevo, Bihac, Gorazde, Srebrenica, Tuzla and Zepa.

Amid the ritual bouquet-throwing at the curtain calls (Mr. Collins acted like a gallant flower boy, gathering up the posies thrown by fans at each ballerina's feet), the term \"19th-century war horse\" was also tossed out and overheard. Yet as far as this blessedly straightforward production by David Blair is concerned, the term resonates positively.

Gurney may be the last playwright who writes full time about that quaint old bird, the New England WASP. Maybe it's an unfashionable calling, but Mr. Gurney's view of his terrain is so objective that his plays often fill in the missing pieces of the fractured American social puzzle. When you meet the economically rarefied yet often emotionally disadvantaged characters in Gurney plays like \"Love Letters\" and \"The Cocktail Hour,\" you remember just why the rest of the country has spent 25 or so years fleeing in the opposite direction.   Austin, the Boston banker at the center of \"Later Life,\" Mr. Gurney's enjoyable new 80-minute comedy at Playwrights Horizons, is one of the playwright's saddest creations. (Or half-creations. In the Playbill, Mr. Gurney acknowledges a debt to Henry James, whose tale \"The Beast in the Jungle\" seems the play's point of departure.) A smart and genial preppie in late middle age, Austin rather resembles the President he voted for in the last election. He's likable and polite, and he puts in his time at the office, but what exactly is he doing with his life?

In the last 10 years, the Kurds have driven tens of thousands of Assyrians and Chaldeans into exile, and yet Western commentators persist in their naive belief that the Kurds are the only oppressed people in the region.   The Chaldeans and Assyrians, among the earliest converts to Christianity, have lived in the north of Iraq and southeast of Turkey for almost four millennia. They still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus.    At the beginning of the 1980's there were 25,000 Chaldean Christians living around Mardin in the predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey. Now there are only 200 or 300. Churches and monasteries in existence more than 1,000 years have been forced to close forever.   These people left because the Kurds told them they had no future in a land the Kurds would soon control. And with establishment of the so-called safe haven just across the border, the Chaldean and Assyrian Christians of northern Iraq have been driven to the same conclusion. Since the Persian Gulf war tens of thousands of them have fled, mostly to Turkey and Jordan.   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ankara pretends these Christian peoples have nothing to fear from the Kurds (who massacred them along with Armenians early in this century), from Saddam Hussein or from the rising tide of Islam. Western countries support this line, despite the hundreds who have died trying to enter the European Community illegally.   The protection zone in northern Iraq may save the Kurds, but it does nothing to help the large numbers of Christians still living there. Northern Iraq -- like the rest of that unhappy country -- is composed of minorities: Kurds, Turkomans, Yezidis, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and they all need Western protection. Mr. Safire is absolutely right to demand that the West should do more than it is doing, but without linking this aid to safeguards for all these peoples, the West will simply be facilitating in Northern Iraq the ethnic cleansing it condemns in Bosnia.

Not long ago, lax procedures led to an explosion in a store for nuclear waste at Tomsk.\n\nWhy did all this happen? What can be done? Undoubtedly, the Communist system is largely responsible.
