A fourth golfer, Gene Sarazen, also accomplished this feat, and was the first to do so. Sarazen won the Masters in 1935, the United States Open in 1922 and '32, the British Open in 1932 and the P.G.A. in 1922, '23 and '33.

Not that the city lacks fine monuments and museums. Yet, somehow, it is the Madrilenos who provide the real show. They live their city like no other. And, believe me, it is not easy to keep up with them. They seem incapable of staying at home, they love to rub shoulders in crowds, they talk, eat and drink well into the night, they ramble through streets before dawn and, well, they never seem to sleep.   So it takes a special energy to get to know Madrid. And, because its streets are noisy, polluted and clogged with traffic on weekdays, the weekend is the best time to do so. The city has five million inhabitants and sprawls far and wide, but much of it can be ignored. What entices is the old city with the grand Plaza Mayor at its heart, the Madrid de los Austrias, as it is known in honor of the Habsburg kings who built it in the late 16th and 17th centuries. This is where the Madrilenos like to hang out.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/style/c-corrections-630195.html","abstract":"  A caption in the Evening Hours pages last Sunday, about an opening at the American Craft Museum, confused the identities of several people because of a picture substitution during the production process.

Like the \"girls\" in the Cyndi Lauper song of the 1980's, they too just want to have fun. American Express, which says it discovered this propensity through customer feedback, has set up Senior Memberships and a \"Just for You\" program to accommodate the leisure habits of the Class of '47 and earlier: the saddle-shoe crowd, the Lindy bunch, the parents of the baby boomers. Even with the program's frills, probably the most appealing part of the senior card is that people over 62 pay less for it: $35 a year instead of $55 a year for the regular green card and $55 a year instead of $75 for the gold card. Here is a roundup of some other special programs for older travelers, some changes in continuing programs and further details on the American Express senior card and the organizations that have linked up with it.   On one front, the news is less than wonderful. In October, the major airlines except Trans World Airlines raised the prices of the coupon books sold to people over 62. Coupon books, valid for a year, with blackout dates, contain four or eight one-way tickets, usually useful only in the 48 contiguous states. T.W.A. sells only four-coupon books, and its price is still $496. The coupons may be used on trips to Puerto Rico and come with a certificate for 20 percent off any ticket to Europe.

These days, Mr. Paik's focus has shifted from performance art to multi-screen television installations and global satellite productions. Nonetheless his Dadaist impulses persist, often taking the form of more subtle acts of esthetic subversion, like using magnets to destroy the normal functions of a bank of television monitors, or staging events like \"The First Accident of the 21st Century,\" a choreographed collision between a robot and an automobile driven by a friend. NAM JUNE PAIK: Video Time -- Video Space (Abrams, $49.50) is a lavishly illustrated, highly eclectic survey of the artist's career, from his early Fluxus days in Germany to his experiments with video technology and room-sized video environments in the 1970's and 80's. Rather than presenting Mr. Paik's career chronologically, the editors -- Toni Stooss, director of the Kunsthalle Vienna, and Thomas Kellein, director of the Kunsthalle Basel -- have mixed previously published articles by critics and museum curators with new writings and reminiscences by friends, fellow artists and Mr. Paik himself. The results are uneven, though there are memorable surprises, including a sly interview with John Cage, whose music was a major influence on Mr. Paik, and an evocative essay by the feminist writer Kate Millett recalling the near-utopian idealism of the New York art scene in the early 1960's. Other contributors include the architect Arata Isozaki and the poet Allen Ginsberg. This is a provocative book that chronicles not only Mr. Paik's career but also 30 years of changes in the international art world.\nANDREA BARNET","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"LONG ISLAND JOURNAL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/nyregion/long-island-journal-634115.html","abstract":"  Joie de $500 Chausseurs   IT was a party where everyone was looking at everyone's feet.

Rock is just now reaching its 40's, too young for a golden anniversary, so seeking a golden age may be premature. But in its short existence, rock has evolved fast. Shaped and disseminated by electronic media with a short attention span, rock has gone through phases and backlashes that mimic the history of older musical and artistic forms in foreshortened ways. Its peak -- or, as I'm about to suggest, peaks -- would be measured in years rather than decades.   Any search for rock's golden age is complicated by pop's connection to youth. Most listeners remember the height of rock perfection as coinciding with their own prime years from, say, ages 16 to 23. That's when the music's promises of freedom and pleasure and power begin to ring true, as the constraints of adolescence give way to the privileges of adulthood while the responsibilities haven't yet sunk in.

Mr. Katz, the media critic for Rolling Stone magazine, deals pointedly, even poignantly, with various crises of commuter life in his detective series, which began with \"Death by Station Wagon\" and continues with THE FAMILY STALKER (Doubleday, $18.95). But his keen anthropological observations on divorce, adultery, emotional abandonment, financial reversal, career burnout, peer pressure, child worship and other facets of privileged life in a New Jersey bedroom community are delivered with so much wit and affection that readers are not about to shred their commuter tickets and go loft hunting in TriBeCa.   \"Divorce is so common, you sort of forget how devastating it is,\" a depressed wife confides to Christopher (Kit) Deleeuw, a discredited Wall Street trader who serves as the town's only private detective. Kit believes that the family is \"sacred,\" so he really puts his heart into his investigation of a malicious home wrecker who is not content with a bit of \"normal suburban adultery,\" but feels compelled to infiltrate and destroy entire families.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS: April 3, 1994","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/books/paperback-best-sellers-april-3-1994.html","abstract":"                Weeks    This   On    Week   List   Fiction              1   7   THE CLIENT, by John Grisham.

The larger one, to which most of us belong -- the one that today's Hollywood aims at and that most critics are conscripted to write for -- enters the theater with the reduced expectations of adults. A movie is a one-night stand. You get your popcorn, you get your hit from the screen, and you walk out more or less satiated, without a backward glance. I mean this literally.    The second audience, considerably smaller, enters with the question \"Am I going to want to go back?\" Their moviegoing is prompted by a childish anticipation of finding films they can live in, and their judgments are founded in a small child's delight in repetition. The backward glance is their basic accolade. Anything that cannot withstand at least two viewings is, for them, often not worth one. Consider Oscar night from their point of view.

The city's streets teemed with people -- from lowlife and riffraff to cloaked royalty and aristocrats seeking anonymity in the crowds -- and in the finest democratic tradition, all took part in the life of the tabernas. (A 16th-century refrain quips: \"In Madrid, wild city/ that between the old and new/has 300 taverns/and not a single library.\") For centuries kings and their courts fled to the bustling taverns around the royal palace to escape the pressures of public life and to engage in romantic trysts. (It is said that Francisco de Goya was stabbed by a jealous husband in front of one tavern; Alfonso XIII was a well-known nocturnal prowler.) Taverns, in fact, did such good business that even convents and monasteries in Madrid began making wines and installing bars.\n\nBut it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that Madrid's tabernas reached their height, becoming uniquely Madrileno and acquiring a somewhat stylish veneer. Students found the inexpensive food, casual surroundings and convivial atmosphere to their liking. Affordable to all, tabernas dissolved class distinctions. Madrid's cultural elite, enthralled by the bohemian life of the tavern, gathered each evening for lively light conversation or intellectual debate, poetry readings, music and song.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Comptroller's Report Questions Benefits From Casino Gambling","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/nyregion/comptroller-s-report-questions-benefits-from-casino-gambling.html","abstract":"  In a report that strongly questions the benefits of casino gambling, New York State's Comptroller, H.

The Swedish company made one of the grandest of grand operas small: choosing voices of lyric quality, editing texts to provide focus and intimacy, eliminating the ballet and the crowds Verdi included to please Paris audiences. The Met, on the other hand, made the small large. Elijah Moshinsky's production dwarfed Shakespeare's handful of characters with oversize stage trappings. There were battlements lowered by a stage elevator, a bedroom dominated by columns suitable for the central office of a bank, and classical paintings the height of the stage.   These examples of Verdi grand and small might be the results of opposing artistic missions: the Swedish company strips away spectacle, the Met adds it. But the companies were also responding to opposing aspects of Verdi's work. (\"Don Carlos\" was first performed in 1867; \"Otello,\" in 1887, soon after Verdi produced a revised version of \"Don Carlos.\") The Met's grandeur emphasized the social and public themes in Verdi; the chamber-size Swedish production focused on interior, private preoccupations.

A four-inch pin in brass, pewter or silver, it depicts in diagrammatic form the hull of a slave ship and the arrangement of its tightly packed human cargo during the middle passage, the slaves' horrific voyage from Africa to the colonies. In one design, five cowrie shells (the number five is a symbol of justice in African lore) hang from the bottom of the pin. In the other, the facial images of five slaves hang from metal nooses.   WHO MAKES IT: A Bronx company, Who Deserves It More Than You? at 558 Grand Concourse, Box 1361, Bronx 10451; (718) 367-5233. The pin is the creation of Phyllis Bowdwin, a black jewelry designer who specializes in accessories for the African-American market. The pins sell for $75 (brass, with cowrie shells) and $120 (with slave images).   INSPIRATION FOR DESIGN: The pin commemorates 400 years of slavery and the deaths of millions of Africans in the slave trade. \"I decided to make the pin because I was disturbed that nothing had been done in terms of erecting a monument or permanent commemoration of the time of the middle passage,\" Ms. Bowdwin said.   HISTORY OF THE SHIP DIAGRAM: This image of the slave ship was first seen in \"The Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade by the British Parliament,\" a book by Thomas Clarkson that was published in 1808. The diagrams in the book depicted the ship from seven different angles, including a bird's-eye view of the top two decks and an intricate cutaway.    The image used for the pin, showing the teeming lower deck, is the most commonly reproduced. Dr. James Smalls, chairman of the African-American and Puerto Rican studies program at the City College of New York, said that almost all of the ships were designed basically the same way.   Ms. Bowdwin said, \"It is a classic image, a picture that was used over and over again, because it symbolized that whole period.\"    HOW THE PIN BECAME POPULAR: Ms. Bowdwin said she first introduced the pin in December at the Kwanzaa Holiday Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, where it was virtually overlooked. But she said that after one Expo shopper, a man, bought the cowrie-shell design, she began receiving orders, and she speculated that word-of-mouth helped create the demand. Since then, she said, she has sold more than 200 pins to buyers in the Northeast.   WHO WEARS IT: Dubaka Leigh, a computer graphics engineer at ABC, does. He said he bought it so he would not forget the legacy of slavery. It is a testament \"of the cruelty and barbarism of selling human beings as if they were beef and livestock,\" he said. The pin, he added, often ends up serving as a history lesson for most people.    REACTIONS: Ms. Bowdwin said some people want it and some are repulsed by it. \"Most people don't realize what it is at first,\" she said. \"The cowrie shells usually draw people to it. When they look closer, they start asking questions, and when I explain the legacy, they get really quiet.\"   Some black people won't consider wearing the pin because they don't want to confront the past or to be identified with it, she said. But those who have what she termed \"a higher level of consciousness\" buy it without hesitation.    WHY NOW: \"Many would rather forget what happened during that time because it is a shameful issue,\" she said. \"But just as the Jewish people remember their Holocaust, blacks should remember their legacy. It's something we have inherited. The legacy is pain, low self-esteem, self-hatred and racism on many levels deeply ingrained in our society.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940403","headline":"Chronicles of the Plague Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/03/books/chronicles-of-the-plague-years.html","abstract":"LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF DEATH\nTuberculosis and the Social Experience\nof Illness in American History.\nBy Sheila M.

Below the compound, in anticipation of a siege by the Israeli Army, they have secretly burrowed tunnels leading to underground living spaces adjoining the nearby burial site of the first Jews, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.

But total prohibition of cigarettes, with no special provision for today's smokers, would create a black market larger than that for cocaine. A smart policy would separate current addicts from new users.\n\nSince almost every smoker picks up the habit during adolescence, the key to reducing smoking is to keep teen-agers from starting. Controls on advertising, a crackdown on sales to minors and designating more smoke-free areas can all help. Raising cigarette taxes would be even more effective, but this approach has its drawbacks if carried to extremes, as experience in Canada has shown. The Canadian tax of $5 a pack, introduced in the early 90's, reduced smoking among teen-agers, but it was a huge burden on low-income people addicted to cigarettes (a two-pack-a-day smoker carried a $3,500 annual habit). It also made drugstores the targets of tobacco robberies and spurred so much tax evasion -- eventually 80 percent of cigarettes smoked in Canada were smuggled -- that this year the Government had to cut the tariff to keep up tax revenues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Firepower and Ice: Lake Superior State Ambushes B.U.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/sports/ncaa-championship-firepower-and-ice-lake-superior-state-ambushes-bu.html","abstract":"  For a college hockey championship game, a 9-1 score is astonishing, like 100-50 in basketball or 73-0 in football.

It has received scant attention in the West, even though the U.S. will be an important participant.

May thine glories never fade   Or perish in an ambuscade!   Every spring about this time, I conclude that my place in baseball history is not yet secure. Few believe there was ever a time without an Opening Day, but there was such a time, and it was I who greased the sleeves of the club owners with \"Say, boys, wouldn't it be grand if every season began on the same day? Oh, what an adventure that would be!\"   \"Well, boys,\" the pooh-bahs exclaimed, \"does the lad have a point or not?\" The lad was 12, and did. The year, 1878.   We called our game base-ball back then, which seemed such a waste of space. That's another of my contributions. I still preserve a copy of my letter to the Scribes Association of 1875. \"Oh, you Scribes,\" I postulated, \"drop the hyphen and save the space!\" I signed it \"A NineYearOld With Ideas in His Bean.\" And that's what I was.   With my brother Neddy I spent many unsupervised hours tossing a Cognac bottle up against our barn. The game was to make our mother come bounding and leaping out. My, but she was widely held to be insane! Her appearances each counted as a run. Later, Neddy, who penned verse to toughen his fielding hand, dashed off these lines in her sainted honor: Mother, your apron is burning,   But I cannot put it out.   I'm miles away in a pasture,   Playing base-ball  [ sic ]  like a lout.   Mother, your leggings are burning,   They have a phosphoric smell.   But I'm running bases, Dear Heart,   They'll love your pies in Hell.    When it became too dark to continue our games, we would join our comrades of all ages in sitting around and yacking baseball, forever baseball, unless someone had plague blankets, and then we dared each other to sleep in them.   But soon it was back to baseball. I heard much wild talk of the tragedy of the Monitor and the Merrimac, and the number of lefty twirlers who gave their lives on those ships. At these times, in the closing dark, we felt a special sense of each other's destinies, but tastefully, we kept that kind of news to ourselves.   On one occasion, the superb Kid Gerty loomed at the center of our bunch. The chesty second sacker had been recently expelled from the Hartfords for muffing a superstition. \"Boys, I let a missionary parade about in my uniform. What harm could it do this once?\" he sobbed. \"I was dead wrong, and my mates were right to cast me out.\"   I asked Gerty did I have the stuff to be a true professional.   \"Oh, I couldn't say,\" he replied. \"It would crush you. No, I haven't a clue.\" This judgment much inflated my standing in town.   Truly, baseball of my day had seized the national imagination, so that made for trouble right there. I observed that there was entirely too much pretending going on. \"Play back, boys, I'm peerless Cappy Anson and he bats like this\" was a common fantasy of the fields. Or perhaps, \"See me, boys, I'm the barrel-chested O'Rourke twins. Say, watch how we feature the stick!\" Gosh, it was an epidemic.   To combat such carelessness, I became the Stance Authenticator, a service which, at 5 cents a player or a dollar a team, was a small price to pay for uniformity. What an inspiring sight it must have been to our women: hundreds of men and boys lined across a meadow, getting Cappy Anson's infernal hitch exactly right.   Inevitably, as my fame spread, I was visited by the Rule Book Committee of the Sporting Clubs -- Benny Songstreet, Senor Lou Cash, P. K. Thotny.    Senor Cash was humming It ain't no rupture, Roger   I'm a-stayin' in the Game.  Thotny asked, \"You the logical boy?\"    I conveyed that I was.   \"Gather round, boys,\" he whispered. \"We are in disarray. Disarray. Where is this season's logic when the Bostons have played all winter, all night, 50 or 60 games a week, salting away enough victories already -- 909 -- to cop the flag several times over? The Indianapoli, however, refuse to commence until their 'grand march' to the Grain Library is done. The Milwauks began yesterday, but the Chi Nine rooters have already accused them of letting gamblers take the field while players roam freely through the stands. Can you help us? Oh, a mumpy randomness is starting to spot the body of a noble racket!\"    \"Infatuated amateurs,\" I cried. \"Smug mice! You must decree one Opening Day and make the squads adhere or else. Then, expunge the records of this erstwhile silly season. The pleasures of monotony are ours for the taking! Oh, isn't this just the life?\"    What is it about those days and ways, why do they haunt me still, inning by inning, pitch by pitch, rolling ever onward like a baseball, endlessly stitched? I gave you the best I've gotten   I spent all the shells I've shotten   My tale is bereft   But it's all I got left   I'm afraid it adds up to notten.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940404","headline":"Blazers Feel the Clinch As Nets Feel the Pinch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/04/sports/pro-basketball-blazers-feel-the-clinch-as-nets-feel-the-pinch.html","abstract":"  For the second straight game, Nets Coach Chuck Daly watched helplessly as his team, playing at home, had a playoff-bound club on the ropes only to go down to defeat.

But the center's board decided in the fall of 1992 that it did not have enough money to proceed with long-range plans for this combined museum, performance space, educational facility and community center. The programming staff was messily fired and uneasy silence settled on what was to have been a major showcase of American culture in the French capital.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940405","headline":"Clinton's Doubleheader: Two Cities, Two Sports","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/us/clinton-s-doubleheader-two-cities-two-sports.html","abstract":"  On Tuesday, he'll be back at work.

John McCluskey, a police spokesman, said investigators were not even sure how the three died, although they thought it possible that the victims were strangled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940405","headline":"The Courteous Computer : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/opinion/IHT-the-courteous-computer-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Who Say's I'm Welcome?

The statement today from the North Korean Foreign Ministry was the first since the president of the Security Council issued a statement on Thursday asking the North to allow a full inspection of its nuclear installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The president's statement, which had been softened after long negotiations with China, the North's last ally, vaguely hinted at the possibility of sanctions if North Korea failed to comply.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940405","headline":"A CD-ROM Magazine Is a Sound Possibility","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/science/peripherals-a-cd-rom-magazine-is-a-sound-possibility.html","abstract":"  MANY personal computers come equipped with CD-ROM drives and sound cards, and almost all can be fitted with them afterward. They open up many possibilities. More and more frequently, high-end software is supplied on disks instead of on a dozen or more floppies; games on CD's offer video sequences, and the devices can even play audio CD's with the proper software.    The Macintosh here is running \"Gershwin Plays Gershwin,\" a nice anachronism: piano-roll reproductions tinkling out of a double-speed AppleCD 300 reader and a pair of speakers. The software is also Apple's: CD Remote, which puts the image of a remote-control unit on the screen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940405","headline":"Rangers Wake Up and Smell the Goals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/sports/hockey-rangers-wake-up-and-smell-the-goals.html","abstract":"  The Florida Panthers woke up in the city that never sleeps and tried to bore everyone into snoring through a hockey game last night.    For two periods at Madison Square Garden, they contained the Rangers with their dull-but-efficient defense, and the score was 1-1 after 40 minutes. But the Rangers broke free with two goals in the third period and hung on for a 3-2 victory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940405","time":"1994-04-05
