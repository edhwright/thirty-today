Grand, 76 East 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-0600. It's common practice for grungy, punkish bands to pilfer the past and rehash it with a heavy dose of irony. Steel Pole Bath Tub, from Montana via San Francisco, revives late-1960's paranoia. While bass and drums chug out a grinding, post-industrialist rhythm and the guitars sputter and shriek feedback and distortion, Michael Morasky, one of the band's three singers, spins grim tales that read like James Ellroy on acid. In \"594,\" from the band's latest album, \"The Miracle of Sound in Motion\" (Boner Records), a psycho sits in the window of his room with a gun pointed at the street; in \"Bozeman,\" a staticky voice whispers, \"They got your mind controlled.\" Steel Pole Bath Tub's malice is just understated enough not to seem silly, and the grooves are deep and tight. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 day of show. Also Sunday night at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Show is at 9 P.M.; tickets are $6. Electric Romanticism    Springhouse, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Ever since the late 1970's, British bands from the Buzzcocks to Felt to Jesus and Mary Chain have toyed with the process of doctoring pop hooks with thick layers of electric guitar. Springhouse, from New York City, updates the formula with a new romanticism. On \"Postcards From the Arctic\" (Caroline), the band's latest album, the vocalist Mitch Friedland sings with supreme detachment, as if he wants to look down on his angst from above. The melodies are pretty and wistful, the sentiments dizzying and sad; at its best, as in \"Asphalt Angels,\" Springhouse captures and holds onto a fleeting sense of melancholy. Tonight at 10. Admission is $6. Brooklyn Blues    The Senders, Sideshows by the Seashore, Boardwalk at West 12th Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 372-5159. One of the few New York bands to have survived the rigors of the 1970's and 80's, the Senders still bash out a classic blend of blues, rhythm-and-blues and ornery attitude that long ago crystallized into the first wave of punk rock. The brawny, no-nonsense approach and dedication to tradition seems almost innocent when compared with today's young punks, the way 60's soul seems innocent compared to hip-hop; it's a style that lingers outside the mainstream, a little bit tougher than time and trends. Tonight at 10.

In essence, the proposal would force wealthy districts to choose from a range of options for helping out poorer schools, like shifting part of their tax base to poorer schools, providing teachers and other help for them or even merging with nearby poor school districts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930528","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-91033714811.html","abstract":"The Right Thing to Do .

Relatives, friends and associates look back warmly on the brother who might have been President. For them the years have not dimmed the glow of his promise, and the old criticisms of cold-bloodedness in pursuit of victory or vengeance, briefly alluded to here, give way to recollections of his soft-heartedness, particularly in his commitment to civil rights.   Criticism is muted of a man whose political career began in the service of Senator Joseph R.

A few other authentic spots can be found -- Zarela on Second Avenue and Mi Cocina on Jane Street in the West Village, for example -- but for the most part Mexican food here is considered a cheap, low-octane fill-up by struggling post-collegiates who ameliorate the experience with buckets of margaritas.   Josephina Howard, the chef and co-owner, is an enthusiastic proponent of regional Mexican cuisine, and her diverse menu reflects that. You will not encounter any jalapeno Alamos at Rosa Mexicano. Dishes are highly seasoned but rarely fiery. If one criticism can be made about the menu, it is that dishes rarely change. Daily specials aside, the lineup today is for the most part the same as when the restaurant was reviewed in 1990. And that review remarked: \"The menu has not changed much since my last review in 1986.\" Sticking to a winning formula makes sense, to be sure, but at the same time one expects innovation from a restaurant of this caliber.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930528","headline":"South Africa Frees 43 Blacks Seized in Crackdown","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/south-africa-frees-43-blacks-seized-in-crackdown.html","abstract":"  The police today released 43 black militants arrested two days ago in a crackdown on the Pan Africanist Congress, conceding that they did not have evidence linking them to specific crimes.

The three-movement work was commissioned by the orchestra for its 150th anniversary celebration this year.   It is not a happy piece. Indeed, listeners are likely to be as impressed by Mr. Husa's vivid skills as they are depressed by his melancholy message.

Four more unearned runs in the third put the game out of reach. Fordham (31-26) next plays the loser of last night's game between Oklahoma State and Connecticut. (AP) Rutgers Loses One: In Knoxville, Tenn., Clemson won, 7-3, to hand Rutgers its first loss in the Mideast Regional. Rutgers (37-16), the Atlantic 10 Conference champion, will play the loser of the game between N.C.-Charlotte and Tennessee. (AP) Yale Is Out: In College Station, Tex., North Carolina eliminated Yale, 11-6, in the Central I Regional. Yale, winner of the Ivy League, ends the season at 33-11. (AP) GOLF  Clearwater Shoots a 61, and He's in Third  Fulton Allem weathered a record-setting performance by Keith Clearwater and established a one-stroke lead yesterday in the storm-delayed second round of the Southwestern Bell Colonial in Fort Worth, Tex. Allem birdied the final hole from 25 feet to cap a seven-under 63 and set a tournament record of 11-under-par 129 over the first 36 holes. Clearwater birdied the last seven holes -- averaging more than 20 feet a putt while falling one short of the PGA Tour record -- for a 61 on the 7,010-yard Colonial course. His 61 was a course and tournament record, and a score that has been bettered only 10 times in the history of the American tour, a pair of 59's by Al Geiberger and Chip Beck, and eight scores of 60. With a 132 total, however, Clearwater trailed both Allem and Dick Mast, who shot 66 and was a stroke off the pace on a day the course was robbed of its natural defenses by gentle breezes and greens slowed and softened by a day-long series of showers. In a group at 133, one behind Clearwater, were Tom Watson, Greg Norman, Russ Cochran, Mark Calcavecchia and Jeff Maggert. (AP) Two Eagles for Robbins: Kelly Robbins had two eagles in a four-under-par 68 yesterday to take sole possession of the lead after two rounds of the L.P.G.A. Corning Classic in Corning, N.Y.. Robbins, who started the round in a three-way tie for the lead, has a 36-hole total of 138, one stroke in front of Hiromi Kobayashi of Japan, who also shot a 68. Alison Nicholas had a 71 and was next at 141.  Murphy and Turnesa Rally: Going into the back 18 of the 36-hole best-ball Wilson Memorial Cup yesterday at the Scarsdale (N.Y.) Golf Club, Steve Murphy and Jim Turnesa thought their chances of winning the 22d annual tournament for a third time were minimal. The twosome from the Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford finished the first 18 with a two-under-par 70 that put them in seventh place, seven strokes off the leaders, John Baldwin and Peter Van Ingen of the Meadow Brook Country Club on Long Island. But Murphy and Turnesa combined for a 65 on the back to finish with a 135 and earn the victory by a stroke as Baldwin and Van Ingen scored a 73 and fell into a second-place tie at 136. Also in second was Ridgewood team of Paul Antenucci and Tim Shea.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930529","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/29/sports/transactions-158093.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League   MINNESOTA TWINS -- Recalled Larry Casian, pitcher, from Portland of the Pacific Coast League.

But these attacks appear wildly overstated, an irresponsible invitation to bigotry. They will make a tough job even tougher.   Dr. Moses faces a formidable challenge: to rebuild the premier campus of a beleaguered City University system, while navigating the city's treacherous political waters. City College was once the jewel in the City University's crown. Acclaimed as an Ivy League equivalent among urban colleges, it counts numerous Nobel laureates among its graduates.

The victory will not silence critics like Ross Perot, who is again cluttering the airwaves with cheap shots safely fired from distant sound stages. But it certainly gives the lie, at the least for now, to Mr. Perot's claim that he alone can end gridlock.   There was a lot on the line Thursday, including Mr. Clinton's political reputation. The question was whether a man who'd been wrong-footing himself at every turn could summon the energy to save his budget plan -- the centerpiece of an economic strategy that would surely have crashed, perhaps taking his Presidency with it, had the Republicans prevailed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"One Idea, and That a Bad One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/books/one-idea-and-that-a-bad-one.html","abstract":"THE MAN WHO STAYED BEHIND\nBy Sidney Rittenberg and Amanda Bennett.\nIllustrated. 476 pp. New York:\nSimon & Schuster. $25.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"The World Is Wide Open","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/style/egos-ids-the-world-is-wide-open.html","abstract":"  NAME: Liv Tyler.

Ms. Herrera, a dark-haired, dark-eyed 17-year-old from Buenos Aires, joined the company in 1991 and is a member of the corps de ballet, though she often dances solo roles. She is a fluid classicist, the kind of dancer who brings a sunny ease to the most demanding of pyrotechnics.

Those who did without slipping over the poverty line either made a fortune in junk bonds or heard the basic capitalist commandment grow as loud as a bass amplifier: \"Thou shalt want more and more.\" The tendency to commodify just about everything, a tendency of long standing, swelled in that decade to a kind of Wagnerian climax. Art, far from being exempt, had already become an investment vehicle and went through boom and bust cycles as if paintings were the Nasdaq composite. Photographs now tagged along for the ride.   Before there was even an art market for photography, the camera was deeply implicated in the commodification business. In the 19th century, photographs contributed to the translation of personality into consumer merchandise that came to be called celebrity. In the 1920's, when advertisers realized how effective they already were in whetting appetites, photographs became central to the selling of desire. Then in the 80's, just as large numbers of photographers decided to critique the consumption of images, the market finally decided that photographs were worth money and turned them into commodities too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"It's Substitution Time in Vermont","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/sports/sports-people-basketball-it-s-substitution-time-in-vermont.html","abstract":"  PAM BORTON, an assistant coach at the University of Vermont for five years, is the school's new women's basketball coach.

The best-selling author and aviator had come to America for four weeks; he remained for more than two years. He was rarely unhappier, or more productive: in his 27 American months he wrote more than half the pages by which he would be remembered, including \"The Little Prince,\" published in New York 50 years ago this spring in both English and French. A half-century after its first publication, that slim volume has done as much to undermine as to sustain Saint-Exupery's reputation as a philosophizing Hemingway, a Conrad of the skies, a French T. E. Lawrence; however, it continues to sell 100,000 copies a year in the United States alone.   Saint-Exupery enjoyed a triumphant welcome to New York, a city that looked dazzling and wild with animation after the ashen skies and curfews of Europe. Two weeks after his arrival he claimed his 1939 National Book Award, conferred by the American Booksellers Association, for \"Wind, Sand and Stars,\" a poetic account of his flying experiences over North Africa and South America. He was a year late for the ceremony, at which the fiction winner had been John Steinbeck; at the time Captain de Saint-Exupery had been flying near-suicidal reconnaissance missions for the French Air Force.

Gergen, the master salesman, sat on the sidelines and marveled at the cleverness of the new President's marketing plan.   \"It is clear now, in contrast to how Clinton presented himself during the campaign, that the Democrats' true agenda is to reverse the direction set by Ronald Reagan,\" said Mr. Gergen, who was the White House communications director in Mr. Reagan's first term. \"And the irony is that they are attempting to do this by using the same techniques Reagan used.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930530","headline":"Constables' Use of Weapons Is Challenged","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/nyregion/constables-use-of-weapons-is-challenged.html","abstract":"THEY wear \"police\" uniforms and badges, carry pistols and drive cars with sirens, red lights and emblems shaped like police shields.

While a child's first steps are always exciting, Rhey's were especially so. He was 12 years old. To Rhey, who is physically and developmentally disabled, those first steps opened up a freedom he had never known. To those who helped him achieve that freedom, Rhey's steps were yet another sign of the progress that the Connecticut Institute for the Blind/Oak Hill in Hartford has made in its 100 years. \n\nThe institute's name is somewhat of a misnomer, a vestige of the days when it was home to scores of blind children, most of whom entered as babies and either left as young adults or stayed on for life. Today the institute serves people with a wide range of disabilities including mental retardation and physical handicaps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Washington;\nA Midcourse Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/realestate/northeast-notebook-washington-a-midcourse-correction.html","abstract":"A NINE-STORY, $656 million, 3.1-million-square-foot Federal building is undergoing midcourse corrections in design and function.\n\nExcavation began in the spring of 1991 and footings were poured last January, with the bottom floor being poured now.

Or so Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, the show's co-creators, would have you believe. Actually, employing an uncanny ear and a laserlike eye for the mundane, \"Seinfeld\" at its best is about life's minutiae. And that embraces just about everything.    Recently, on a crosstown bus to Lincoln Center, a man and woman who had obviously just met rambled loudly through a hilariously disjointed account of their jobs, families, former spouses. Sitting just in front of them as a captive audience, my companion and I listened for a few minutes and simultaneously whispered the same single word: Seinfeld! It would have made perfect dialogue for an episode. The weekly series, recently on a ratings roll in its Thursdays-at-9:30 slot and eagerly grabbed by its network for a fourth year, has become that pop-culture prize: a defining experience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"IN THE NATURAL STATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/nyregion/in-the-natural-state.html","abstract":"THE robins were starting their evening song as our van turned off the macadam and onto a rutted lane.

To assess the project's impact to the wetlands, one must determine the current condition of the area. A comparison of the 1974 New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Tidal Wetlands Map with present onsite conditions indicates a deterioration of the intertidal marsh as a result of roadway runoff, which has increased siltation, raising elevations in the area. If no reconstruction occurs, the degradation will continue and result in the loss of both intertidal marsh islands that exist in the area and the intertidal strip along the western tidal bank. In addition, the siltation has restricted tidal flows to the wetlands south of the roadway, causing the quality of the wetland to be degraded to the lowest classification.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"SURFACING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/style/surfacing.html","abstract":"  MUSIC -- Album art: Rock-and-roll art may never die, despite vinyl's downfall.

That was the good news for them; the bad news was that the occupancy rate for hotels in the United States was still only 60 percent, with the increase mainly caused by a slowing of hotel-building. This, in turn, is good for travelers, because it means there are many special summer rates, particularly ones designed to appeal to families that might otherwise stay with relatives to save money in tough times. Many of the new rates go into effect this weekend and run into September.    Notable this year are the offers from high-priced resorts, including some in the Caribbean and elsewhere outside the United States. And Club Med, which has usually had a family program at five of its clubs for specified periods between May and December, has added specials at two more clubs -- Caravelle on Guadeloupe and Huatulco in Mexico, for children 6 through 11, during July and August only. Some other resort promotions focus on day camps for children, with T-shirts, trips and cookouts, usually for an added fee.  A Sampling of Programs    Here is a selection of the more interesting summer packages.    Ramada International Hotels and Resorts -- not the domestic Ramada Inns -- calls its promotion a Summer Sale. Rates at all 11 of the group's hotels and resorts in the Caribbean and Latin America are reduced 30 to 50 percent through Sept. 30. In the Caribbean, the rates range from $75 a night at the Yacht Haven Hotel and Marina in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, to $100 a night at the Treasure Island Resort at Grand Cayman. In Latin America, the rates are $55 to $80 a night. Up to four people, children included, may stay in the room. Ramada International, 2655 Le Jeune Road, Suite 800, Coral Gables, Fla. 33134; (800) 854-7854.    Marriott's Family Room promotion has a twist: The stay must be paid for in full by credit card 21 days in advance, and the reservation is nonrefundable and not changeable. The rates for the 185 participating Marriott Hotels in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico (not Marriott's Courtyard, Residence or Fairfield Inns) start at $49 a night on weekends, a discount of 55 percent off regular prices, and $59 a night on weekdays, and range up to $139 in Hawaii on the weekend and $192 in New York on weekdays. Up to five people may occupy a room; one or two children aged 10 or younger may eat free from a children's menu for each adult entree ordered at breakfast, lunch or dinner. The special offer extends from June 18 to Sept. 6. Up to four rooms may be reserved. (The rate may not be available where there are conventions in town.) Marriott Hotels, Marriott Drive, Washington, D.C. 20058; (800) 228-9290.    Radisson is offering its Shades of Summer promotion for the fifth year. This program, which continues until Sept. 6, applies to all Radisson hotels in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, London, Berlin and Australia. The rates vary by hotel, with the lowest nightly rate $49; half the 277 properties are offering rates of $59 a night or less. Reservations are required, to confirm availability; some resorts may have a policy of advance payment. When there are local festivals or sports events, the rates may not be available. Radisson Hotels International, Post Office Box 59159, Minneapolis, Minn. 55459; (800) 333-3333.    Inter-Continental Hotels is offering discounts of up to 50 percent in its Summer Options program at 11 hotels in the United States and Canada. At the New Orleans Inter-Continental, the rate is $99 a night, single or double occupancy, with children under 14 sharing parents' rooms for free; the New York rate is $179 and the rate at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco is $129. Other options include an adjoining room at 50 percent of the Summer Options rate. The program runs until Sept. 12. Inter-Continental Hotels, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 327-0200.    Wyndham Hotels and Resorts offer a program called Kids on Us until Sept. 30 at Rose Hall, near Montego Bay, Jamaica; Elbow Beach, Paget, Bermuda; Heywoods at St. Peter, Barbados; the Ambassador Beach Resort in Nassau, and the Morgan Bay in Choc Bay on St. Lucia. Under this program, in its second summer, children 12 and under eat free from a children's menu when they eat with parents, and children 18 and under stay free in their parents' room, or qualify for discounts on a second room. Kids Klub activities are offered free from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. for two groups: children 5 to 8, and those 9 to 12. At Morgan Bay, where the price includes meals, the per-person charge for a three-night package with two paying guests in a room starts at $405. A three-night package at Rose Hall starts at $174 a person when two paying guests share the room. Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, 2001 Bryan Street, Suite 2300, Dallas, Tex. 75201; (800) 822-4200.    The 13 Hawthorn Suites in seven states, mostly in the South, are offering packages that may include tie-ins to nearby attractions -- a one-day pass to Sea World in Orlando, Fla., for example. The two-room suites can sleep six people, and full breakfasts are included. The rates start at $80 a night in Arlington, Tex., and run up to $118 for an Orlando offer that includes a minivan rental. All Hawthorn Suites have pools except for the one in Charleston, S.C. Hawthorn Suites, 400 Fifth Avenue, Waltham, Mass. 02154; (800) 527-1133.    On Hilton Head, S.C., Westin Resort's Family Fun package offers parents a room with balcony for two nights for $409; a children's room with balcony for two nights is $240.  Prices include one day of bicycle rental and free meals for children under 10 who eat with their parents. (Children 18 and under in families not buying the package may stay free in their parents' room.) The resort, for the second year, is also offering a recreation program for children 5 to 12 years old, Camp Wackatoo, through Labor Day. This costs $35 a day for the first child, $20 for the second, but it is free for children under the package plan. The Westin also provides strollers, car seats and playpens as well as cribs, free of charge.

Until Oct. 31, rates at the Sandy Lane Hotel and Golf Club in St. James, Barbados, begin at $395 a night for garden-view rooms and rise to $520 for the best ocean-view room. Children up to 12 stay in their parents' room free. Meals are included. The hotel is starting a nanny service, available from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., which is free for children up to 6 years old. For children 7 and up, there is a $6-an-hour charge for the service. The same fee is charged for other children's activities, including sports lessons, movies and excursions. Sandy Lane Hotel and Golf Club, St. James, Barbados, West Indies; (809) 432-1311; fax (809) 432-2954.  Camp With a Western Theme    The Pointe Hilton at Squaw Peak, one of three Pointe Hiltons in Phoenix, is offering a new program, Coyote Camp, which features a different Western theme each day. A main attraction is meeting wranglers and learning about the care of horses. Children 5 to 12 may participate from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily, at a cost of $35 a day for each child. At all three resorts, children under the age of 18 stay free in their parents' suites, which have two television sets and a refrigerator. Until Sept. 15, the rate for suites is $69 a night.

Squares or small parks, these sanctuaries sometimes possess a peculiarly Parisian elegance and grandeur. Others have a quiet charm that is distinctly provincial, suggestive of boules and pastis in the dusk.   To walk among these squares, particularly in summer, alternating the hectic activity of this eminently commercial city with moments of quietness, is to experience an essential quality of Paris. For part of the charm of this town lies in the way it amalgamates many moods and images, conjuring, in a sudden grandiose vista, the glory of a certain notion of France, only to evoke, a moment later, the intimacy of village life through the figure of a surly concierge mopping a sidewalk in her bathrobe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"Five Writers + One Star = A Hit?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/movies/film-five-writers-one-star-a-hit.html","abstract":"  In Hollywood, nearly every one dreams of the big score.

He translated that impression into one of the most powerful images of head-spinning anxiety ever created, \"The Scream\" (1893). Munch (1863-1944), who lived by what he once described as a gospel of pain, expressed the anguish of broken relations, death and illness, isolation and despair in a continuing project, \"The Frieze of Life.\" This thematic series of paintings, which includes such famous works as \"The Dance of Life\" (1900) as well as \"The Scream,\" was first exhibited in 1902 and again, with new pictures, in 1913 and 1918. All 85 paintings are reproduced in EDVARD MUNCH: The Frieze of Life (National Gallery Publications/Abrams, $45); unfortunately, the color is disappointingly muddy. Happily, however, four excellent essays examine aspects of Munch's tempestuous life and proto-Expressionist style. Reinhold Heller, a professor of art history at the University of Chicago, writes entertainingly of the bohemian cafe set in Oslo, where heady discussions of Nietzsche, free love and free thought inspired both Munch and Strindberg to test their limits in a debilitating cycle of drink and problematic affairs that often ended in abandonment, coercion and emotional abuse. Not surprisingly, Munch's women are often either Magdalenes or Madonnas -- lustful, ruined women or prepubescent innocents -- who entwine men in tangles of overpowering feeling. However, Munch's images do not add up to a pessimistic vision of blind despair. His subjects are often caught in a moment not just of pain but of awakening and awareness, as in \"Desire\" (1907), in which a woman looks up in horror as a man buries his face in her bosom. An element of mystery -- what unsettling truth has pressed its way into her mind? -- saves the image from hopeless melodrama. And that is a condition, this book makes plain, that Munch's work, and life, sailed dangerously near.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"A Directory of Jewish Organizations","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/nyregion/a-directory-of-jewish-organizations.html","abstract":"THOSE wishing to find a synagogue or a Jewish organization in the county can do so with a new publication published by the Westchester Jewish Conference. \n\nThe 48-page directory provides the first comprehensive listing of temples and Jewish organizations in the county.
