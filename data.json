The ruling gave the victory to Britain's Damon Hill. Race stewards ruled that a mandatory wooden plank under Schumacher's car, recently required by Formula One and aimed at slowing down drivers, did not meet legal measurement requirements. It was either too thin or too light, giving him an advantage over his competitors. The incident is the third this year to jeopardize Schumacher's dominance, which once seemed vulnerable only to the guardians of Formula One racing. Schumacher, who could have won his eighth title, is already driving under an appeal of a two-race suspension for disregarding a black flag at the British Grand Prix. The German so dominated Sunday's race that even a sloppy spin in the 18th lap failed to allow the competition within striking distance. He finished 13.663 seconds ahead of Hill, his closest challenger in the title chase. The spin could have shaved some wood off the board, which is 30 centimeters wide, one centimeter thick and runs the length of the car. The car is allowed to lose only one millimeter during the race, but the ruling report said up to 2.6 millimeters were missing. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD  Drummond Stuns Christie in 100 Meters  Jon Drummond upset Linford Christie, the Olympic and world champion, in the 100-meter dash yesterday at the Rieti Invitational in Italy.

The world record-holder, Colin Jackson of Britain, pulled away with two barriers left to win the 110-meter hurdles in 13.07 seconds. Americans Alan Johnson and Anthony Dees were second and third, respectively.

Administration officials say their hands are tied by archaic laws and that there is nothing they can do. But if people like Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and Vice President Al Gore genuinely wish to be remembered as aggressive and caring stewards of the country's environment, they will quickly seek ways to stop this threat in its tracks -- beginning with a summit conference of all inter ested parties and including, if necessary, special legislation.    The threat arises from a Canadian conglomerate, Noranda Inc., which plans to hollow out a mountain that sits above Yellowstone, a scant three miles from the park's border. The mountain is said to contain $500 million in gold, silver and copper. The company promises that poisonous wastes from the mine will not seep into the surrounding streams and the park. But the troubled history of Western mining sends a different message entirely: This project poses a clear long-term threat to the water, wildlife and general sanctity of the 2.2 million acre preserve.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940829","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/29/nyregion/bridge-090999.html","abstract":"  Bridge now, for the first time, has a Europe-United States equivalent of golf's Ryder Cup.

The proposal, drawn up by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, would require the Serbs to give up about a third of the territory they hold in Bosnia and Herzegovina.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940829","headline":"Britten's Ghosts on a Budget in the Berkshires","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/29/arts/opera-review-britten-s-ghosts-on-a-budget-in-the-berkshires.html","abstract":"  For the musical traveler, Tanglewood is the obvious attraction hereabouts, but just up the road the Berkshire Opera Company works miracles in a converted Jesuit chapel, now called the Cranwell Opera House.   Economy is everything for this troupe. Its founder, Rex Hearn, started out in 1985 with $60,000 and dreams of a Glyndebourne in the Berkshires. He engaged an enterprising artistic director and conductor, Joel Revzen, an inventive stage director, Mary Duncan, and a board so committed to the company's mission that its chairman and president, Robin G.

From some you can learn about this and that by listening to people with more information than you possess. Others offer the satisfaction of feeling superior to vox populi. And there are those that just provide the pleasure of watching one's peers mix it up on matters of moment.   \"Talk Back Live,\" the \"daily, live, interactive town meeting,\" to quote the press release, which joined the CNN lineup last week, is in the mix-it-up mode. Susan Rook, presiding, is all bustle-bustle as she fields the opinions not only of a dozen or so audience members but also of callers, faxers and computerniks, all of whom she greets by first name. (Given her constant bending on the first show to put the microphone in the face of participants seated at this studio in the round, one feared for Ms. Rook's knees. Perhaps at her joint specialist's advice, on the second show her guests rose. On Wednesday she stood for some and bent to others; very risky.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940829","time":"1994-08-29

One after another, and then by the dozens, rafts began appearing in the water in front of Havana's oceanfront, known as the Malecon, and a few miles east at Cojimar, which has become the main launching point for those who want to escape from Cuba. Many of the Cubans had been camping on the beaches for days, waiting for the weather to improve.   Trucks also began arriving, depositing people who had come from Alamar in the east and Pinar del Rio in the west, 120 miles away. The trucks carried boats that the refugees had been building at their homes. Because of the current in the Florida Straits, the coast around Havana is the best launching area for the mostly unpowered boats.    Hundreds of well-wishers lined the beaches near Havana as the exodus resumed. A Weather Predicter    No one has been able to predict the flow of refugees, but the weather has been one prognosticator, even better than pleas by Fidel Castro or President Clinton.    Indeed, there has been less science and method involved in how many people have left than there has been strong emotion, including anger at Cuba's economic deterioration and impatience to get on with what everyone knows is a perilous journey.   [ Despite the ample evidence that the number of Cubans leaving was rising sharply, relatively few were picked up by the Coast Guard. As of 10 P.M. Monday, 253 Cubans had been intercepted, up from 84 on Sunday. Last week, in the first rush, the Coast Guard picked up 13,600. ]   \"Tell my mother that I have gone and that I am very happy,\" Marbel Betancourt Gonzalez said just before she jumped into the turquoise waters of Cojimar to scramble onto a rubber and wooden raft with 10 others. Miss Betancourt, who had slept on the beach for nine days waiting for her journey, turned to face the crowd of hundreds of people piled on a crumbling sea wall, and with tears in her eyes she waved and blew kisses.   It is impossible to predict how many Cubans will leave in this wave, but today's activity indicates that the United States policy to deny them automatic asylum will not keep many people at home.   In fact, some of the Cubans say there is an urgency about leaving now.   Two brothers, Felipe and Jesus, came from Pinar del Rio, about 125 miles west of Cojimar, to leave from Cuba in a boat that they had assembled by soldering together pieces of aluminum, then painting it over with tar and padding the inside with plastic foam.   \"We're afraid Mr. Castro is going to say, 'No more,' so we have to leave now,\" Jesus said. \"We came here because this is the closest point to the United States, and it is a good place to launch a boat.\"   The brothers also said that on their stretch of the coast the Government's coast guards still seemed to be patrolling the waters. At Cojimar, there were only a few soldiers in camouflage uniforms, and they did not seem to bother the people leaving. First Boat Leaves    The first boat to leave this morning from Cojimar was a tidy contraption of rubber and wood. It, too, had come on a truck, and it had a wooden rudder and a bow made of aluminum, with lines of thin rope on its perimeter for its passengers to hold onto and a jaunty red yachting flag atop its rough-hewn mast.   One by one people boarded the boat, as hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the littered beach to see them off. A festive atmosphere pervailed. Vendors were selling tamales and guanabo turnovers. The only ones not laughing were the six women and nine men who pushed off, rowing at the direction of an older man who was clearly their captain.   Some people were dispensing advice. One man told a would-be refugee how to judge how far his raft was from tankers that navigate the straits. He told him to hold his hand out in front of him in a fist, with his thumb sticking skyward, and to close one eye. \"If your thumb covers the whole tanker, then he's 10 miles away,\" the older man told the younger one.    Some carried good-luck charms on board. One boat had the Virgin of Charity on its bow. One refugee tried to take his dog on the raft, but the animal ran down a dock away from him.    Ramon Perez Lara, who is 61, was at the beach helping his son Sergio, who would be making about his 30th attempt to leave. The two men personify the debate about whether it is better to abandon Cuba or to stay and make it better.    Mr. Perez fought in the revolution. His family grew tobacco and corn on their small parcel of land, but the inequities of life before Castro's rule left the countryside poor of many things Cubans now have, he said.    \"I learned to read and write after the revolution,\" he said proudly.    But his son, Sergio Lara Caras, has felt let down by the revolution. He made his first attempt to try to leave Cuba on a home-made boat five years ago, when he was 29, and he has been trying ever since. Twice he was picked up by Soviet tankers and turned over to the Cuban authorities.   He has been in prison three times for his so-called treasonous crimes, and has served as long as eight months. He has gotten as far as 35 miles out to sea, far short of the 90 miles to Florida.    \"Castro has turned my struggle into something political by saying I am betraying the country,\" Mr. Lara said. \"But it is only economic. This country does not have opportunities for me anymore. Because I have been arrested for trying to leave, I cannot get the kind of work that will help me have a life.\"   With tears streaming down her face, Berta Serrano Belot waved from the beach to a raft carrying her oldest daughter, 30, and her youngest son, 18.    \"For a mother this is the biggest pain in my entire life, to see my children leaving,\" said Mrs. Serrano, holding a granddaughter's hand.    Another daughter's husband was also on the boat, along with others from their town of San Miguel del Padron, about a three-hour bus ride from here. They had come to Cojimar as a family 12 days ago, and had camped on the beach.    They spent their days scavenging for bits of lumber and other material to build their boat. They bought what they needed with the money they got from selling many of their possessions back home. They had only a few pesos each day to buy bread.    But finally today, those who wanted to go were on their way.    \"I never thought my children would abandon me, but the ruin this country has fallen into has created such misery and hunger that it has forced them to go,\" Mrs. Serrano said, her voice trembling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/style/chronicle-094153.html","abstract":"  ISMAIL MERCHANT, the film producer, and JAMES IVORY, the film director, were hosts of a benefit concert and dinner on Saturday night for the Merchant & Ivory Foundation, a four-year-old nonprofit organization that operates a film center in Claverack, N.Y.

As the November elections approach, Pequot money is flowing across the country in abundant and increasing amounts, to Albany and Hartford as well as Des Moines and Sacramento. And virtually all of it is going to Democrats.   In just the last few months, the tribe -- whose roughly 300 members are expected to earn about $600 million from the casino this year -- has given $100,000 each to the Democratic Party organizations in New York and California and $50,000 to the state party committee in Iowa, all at the direction of national party leaders. It has pledged $250,000 for other state campaigns still to be named. And with total donations of $315,000 over the last two years, it has become one of the single largest contributors to the Democratic Party's National Committee, joining the ranks of huge corporations like Time Warner and big unions like the National Education Association.   What all this means, for the Pequots and the Democrats, is an open question.   Lobbyists and lawyers for the tribe say that Democrats have been good to the Pequots, and American Indians generally, and that across a broad spectrum of issues, from health care to education, the tribal council believes that the Clinton Administration is on the right track. Local Democrats helped the tribe gain Federal recognition in the 1980's -- an old debt that can now be repaid -- and Mr. Clinton held an American Indian summit at the White House in April that was viewed by the Pequots as symbolically significant.   And while some critics grouse that the tribe is only furthering its economic interests as the owner of a huge gambling enterprise, there is little evidence of a Pequot agenda.   The Republican National Committee has offered no comment on the donations or the tribe. Democratic officials in the states getting money say they have had no contact with the tribe, and in the states closest to the casino -- Rhode Island and Massachusetts -- where the tribe would presumably have the keenest interest in influencing debate about gambling, the Pequots and Democrats say there have been no contributions at all.   But people in both parties say that the tribe has found a quick way to become a player in the game of politics. While the size of contributions to individual candidates is limited, the tribe can give as much as it wants to the state and national parties, gaining the maximum good will from party leaders.   \"I would imagine that all they're trying to do is expand their influence,\" said State Senator James T. Fleming, a Connecticut Republican and an opponent of casino gambling. \"As long as it's legal, I don't see anything wrong with it.\"   In Connecticut, the tribe formed a political action committee in July that could under state law give unlimited amounts to candidates. Tribal lawyers said they were also considering forming a national PAC.   Earlier this month, Carrie Saxon Perry, a former Mayor of Hartford and a Democratic candidate for the State Senate, held a fund-raiser at the casino, on the tribe's reservation in Ledyard. Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, a third-party candidate for governor, plans to do a star turn there next month, at a $250-to-$500-a-ticket fund-raiser in a hotel ballroom. Expanded Lobbying Efforts    The tribe has expanded its lobbying efforts, too. It opened a Washington office this year, and a in Hartford this spring its largess surpassed even that of Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino developer who has spent millions in Connecticut over the last few years to try to end the Pequots' monopoly on casino gambling in the state. The Pequots paid a Hartford public relations company $210,000 through mid-June, compared with the $152,000 spent by Mr. Wynn on lobbying, according to the State Ethics Commission.   Experts in American Indian affairs said that many tribes have long had political action committees, and that political contributions have gone up in the last few years. But the Pequots, if only by their grand scale of doing things, still get the attention.   And like all of their previous efforts to test themselves and their newfound economic sovereignty -- from the expansion of land claims to the development of a Pequot legal code -- the new flexing of political muscle is also sparking anxieties about where the tribe is going and what it will do when it gets there.   A lobbyist for the tribe, Charles J. Duffy, said that those \"sensitivities\" had led the tribal council to take what state elections officials say is an extraordinary step: the Pequots will limit contributions to local candidates from its new state PAC, even though it does not have to.   Mr. Duffy said the tribe would consider donations to Democratic and Republican candidates, but will hold donations to the same maximum allowed for business PACs, which can donate only up to $5,000 to a gubernatorial campaign and $500 to an individual state legislative race, with a $100,000 cap on all contributions.   \"We don't want people who are averse to the tribe to be making egregious claims about what the tribe is doing and what it intends to do,\" Mr. Duffy said.   That has not stopped people from questioning, however, why a small tribe would ship its money so far from home.   \"It is my belief that any sound-thinking person would ask why, in this case, an Indian nation would send a significant donation to a political party or elected official in another state,\" said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester County Republican who asked this month for a Federal investigation into the Pequots' $100,000 contribution to the New York Democratic Party.   Mr. Spano, an advocate of casino gambling in New York, said in a letter to the United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, that the State Legislature's defeat in July of an amendment legalizing casinos came within days of the tribe's donation, and that the appearances and timing were questionable, though he had no direct evidence of any wrongdoing.   Chris McNeil, a tribal lawyer who heads the Washington lobbying effort, said the Pequots had had absolutely no contact with New York Democrats, and that the state committees that have received money were all suggested by the Democratic National Committee as places where Democrats could use extra help this year.   \"There's no connection,\" Mr. McNeil said, referring to the gambling issue in New York and the tribe's contribution.   Still, party officials in Iowa and California said that even though the Pequots' national political agenda is vague, their ability to write big checks has not gone unnoticed.  Keeping Track of Friends    Mike Monasmith, a spokesman for the California Democratic Party, said the money had come with no strings attached, but that, if only to protect itself, the party always knows who its friends are.   \"We are sure to make sure we know where they money is coming from,\" Mr. Monasmith said.   In Iowa, Democrats said the Pequots had asked for nothing in exchange for their $50,000 donation.   \"We have some good Congressional races and a good chance of knocking out a Republican governor, but how that ties in to the tribe's agenda, I'm not certain,\" said Ron Parker, a spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party. \"We have no contact with the Indians.\"   Here in Connecticut, where the tribe clearly does have an established agenda -- to keep non-Indian gambling operations out of the state -- politicians said they hoped the new Pequot PAC would be low-key about any kind of loyalty pledge.   \"It should not be a single-issue PAC and I don't think it will be,\" said Edward L. Marcus, the Connecticut Democratic Party chairman. \"I'm not sure that would make too many candidates all that comfortable.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"For Ex-Judge Wachtler, Real Estate by Day, Card Games and Meatloaf at Night","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/nyregion/for-ex-judge-wachtler-real-estate-by-day-card-games-and-meatloaf-at-night.html","abstract":"  During the day, Sol Wachtler will broker real-estate deals from a glass high-rise in an affluent section of Long Island.

And it was, in a performance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Saturday night at the Damrosch Park Band Shell, presented by the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival.

True, the rendering is understated by today's standards -- you don't get to see any gouts of blood -- but the quantifiers would still feel obliged to include the humorous send-offs in their dire compilations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"At Tanglewood, a Late-Summer Study in Contrast","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/arts/music-review-at-tanglewood-a-late-summer-study-in-contrast.html","abstract":"  If Labor Day is the nonscientific dividing line between summer and fall, the end of the Boston Symphony's Tanglewood season is a kind of warning bell here in the Berkshires. It has been an especially eventful summer here. Apart from the orchestra's performances, the endeavors of the student musicians at the Tanglewood Music Center and the pop concerts that fill out the schedule, the newly inaugurated Seiji Ozawa Concert Hall was the subject of much curiosity and comment, most of it enthusiastic.   As warning bells go, the finale of this summer's festival was rousing in the most edifying way. This afternoon, Christoph Eschenbach led an electrifying account of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with the Brahms Alto Rhapsody as a contrastingly introspective prelude. On Friday evening, he had conducted a quirky but generally illuminating Mozart concert.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"Saudis Scrap Plans to Go To Conference On Population","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/world/saudis-scrap-plans-to-go-to-conference-on-population.html","abstract":"Saudi Arabia will not take part in the United Nations population conference next month in Cairo, United Nations officials here said today, giving rise to fears that other Islamic nations will follow the lead of the influential Saudis. \n\nThe Saudis' withdrawal supplies political ammunition to both moderate and militant Islamic groups that have condemned the conference as a plot to dominate the Muslim world by spreading Western \"immorality.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940830","headline":"Don't Judge New York Subway Fare Card After Only 3 Months; How About a Receipt?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/opinion/l-don-t-judge-new-york-subway-fare-card-after-only-3-months-how-about-a-receipt-111341.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As an enthusiastic supporter of public transportation, I often jump on the subway 10 times a day in the conduct of my architecture practice.

The movie, which opened today at the Film Forum, lets its images speak for themselves. It shows how the bulls used in combat are bred to be hot-tempered and aggressive. Long before they enter the ring, they are confined in pens where they are teased and prodded in order to make them more short-tempered.

Monday's program, part of a Shakespeare Festival series of free events, offered a chance to enjoy some of the best young and older stylists in tap today, among them Savion Glover, James (Buster) Brown and Lon Chaney.    The trend is now toward large tap ensembles and large-scale choreography, and much of the individuality of the form is getting lost. Tap dancers once learned the art on city street corners, not in studios, and it was everyone for himself. Out of a root fund of tap steps and combinations came improvisations and elaborations that then became part of the body of tap, spurring others to take the form where they would.
