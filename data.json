Over the years, its funds have been spread too thin and fail to help many of the neediest students.    The Clinton Administration has put forth a sensible plan to concentrate more money on the most disadvantaged students. As Congress begins marking up the bill this week, it should follow the Administration's lead -- and go even further.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940201","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/01/nyregion/metro-digest-039837.html","abstract":"  ALLIANCE OF BLACK GROUPS IN JEOPARDY   Recent bigoted remarks by a chief aide to Louis Farrakhan, minister of the Nation of Islam, and his failure to disavow them have interrupted the tenuous rapprochement between mainstream civil rights leaders and the Nation of Islam.

NEW YORK CITY  GIULIANI NAMES HOUSING CHAIRMAN   Mayor Giuliani named Ruben Franco, the former president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, as chairman of the New York City Housing Authority, concluding an appointment process that had been one of the most difficult for the Mayor. The prospect of Mr. Franco's appointment had created strong opposition among Hasidic leaders in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. B3.

Those truths have often been about how moving bodies defined the empty space around them. But over the last few years the choreographer, now 84, seems to be zeroing in on body shapes, parts and gentle eccentricities, as he does in \"Each Time You Carry Me This Way,\" a 1993 work performed by the Erick Hawkins Dance Company on Thursday night at the Joyce Theater.    The theme of the dance, which is set to a vividly atmospheric score by Lucia Dlugoszewski, is how to carry and be carried. Mr. Hawkins suggests a remarkable variety of emotions and relationships with just the angle of the held body or the way it holds onto its moving carrier.

What to do? The National Academy of Sciences has some useful ideas.    Highly enriched uranium extracted from warheads is relatively easy to render militarily harmless. Once blended down, it can fuel power plants but cannot be used for warheads without re-enrichment. In contrast, plutonium separated from spent fuel is usable in warheads.

The latest, \"From the New World,\" examined Dvorak's efforts to foster an American folk-based symphonic idiom during his years in New York, 1892-95. An orchestra concert led by Dennis Russell Davies on Friday and Saturday evenings at the academy was the centerpiece; the ancillary events were six hours of lectures and recitals at the Majestic Theater on Sunday.    Joseph Horowitz, the orchestra's artistic adviser, has devoted much energy and ink to denouncing the museum culture that prevails in classical music. Yet \"From the New World\" was entirely a museum experience. On display were some large fossils: the \"New World\" Symphony, Mrs. H. H. A.

But in Joao Cesar Monteiro's deadpan comedy \"Recollections of the Yellow House,\" the director himself plays just such a character. Joao de Deus, the Portuguese film maker's cinematic alter ego, is a bumbling, sad-eyed everyman and sometime hack writer of meager resources who exudes disorder.   Joao is one of several eccentric tenants who inhabit a seedy Lisbon rooming house run by the fanatically proper and puritanical Dona Violeta (Manuelade Freiras). In a mordantly funny early scene, Joao complains to his landlady about bedbugs, which may or may not be imaginary. He even chases down one bug and traps it in a container; but it is invisible to the viewer, and when he displays it for Violeta it is also indiscernible. A bedbug rash is not Joao's only ailment. He also has sores in his mouth and an inflamed groin that requires the wearing of an athletic supporter packed with ice cubes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940203","headline":"Fundamentalists Impose Culture on Egypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/world/fundamentalists-impose-culture-on-egypt.html","abstract":"  With their guns and explosives, Muslim militants have destroyed Egypt's tourist industry, scared away investors and halted Egypt's 20-year march toward democracy and economic liberalization.

The admission is disturbing. The Budget Office's estimates of savings from health care reform, through no fault of its own, are guesswork. Yet Mr. Clinton says he is using such guesswork to shape a reform for a generation.    The Budget Office is required to estimate whether proposed budgets satisfy deficit-reduction targets set out in the 1993 budget law. That is never an easy task. When Congress legislates ordinary tax and spending changes -- such as last year's small gasoline tax -- the Budget Office can generate reliable estimates.

Consider Taro, the 110-pound Akita from New Jersey that was granted clemency but exiled by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman last week. Taro, whose psychiatrist describes him as shy and withdrawn, was sentenced to death after being accused of biting his owner's niece on Christmas Day 1990. The dog spent more than 1,000 days as Bergen County's prisoner No. 914095. The legal fees surpassed $100,000.\n\nIt is tempting to view Taro's case as a modern aberration -- American litigiousness gone off the deep end. Not so: animal trials have been around for centuries. In medieval Europe, pigs, horses and other animals were tried for killing or injuring humans. Public beheading and hanging were typical punishments. Defendants were usually imprisoned and fed at the king's expense, while defense lawyers debated arcane points of precedent in lengthy trials.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940203","headline":"Agnes de Mille Tribute","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/arts/agnes-de-mille-tribute.html","abstract":"  A memorial tribute to the choreographer Agnes de Mille is to be at noon on Tuesday at the St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan.

Though he had to compromise with the opposition Liberal Democrats, those reforms that could most benefit relations with the U.S. got through.    One reason Mr. Hosokawa decided to compromise was Tokyo's need to proceed to other business -- stimulating Japan's stalled economy and addressing tough trade demands from Washington. The U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, is now in Tokyo pressing for agreement before Mr. Hosokawa's Feb. 11 summit meeting with President Clinton. Both sides agree that Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S. is politically untenable.
