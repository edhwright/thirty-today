Boston University's 7-6 overtime triumph at Orono on Friday ended Maine's undefeated status this season after 32 games, 30 of them victories. Also concluding were unbeaten streaks of 50 games (46-0-4) at home; 44 regular-season games (40-0-4) and 33 contests (30-0-3) against Hockey East opponents.     Mike Prendergast, Boston University's sophomore forward from South Boston, who had been out a month because of a knee injury, ended all that when his shot went by Mike Dunham at 1 minute 50 seconds of overtime. Dunham, a United States Olympian a year ago, had been unbeaten for Maine in his last 24 games. The Terriers overcame a 6-2 deficit.    The next night Maine won, 6-1, and the two referees, Frank Cole and Drew Taylor, called 51 penalties for a total of 150 minutes, both Hockey East records. There were six 10-minute misconduct penalties, all in the third period. Four Maine goals came on power plays.   The Terriers never stopped Paul Kariya, Maine's celebrated freshman, who had seven assists in the two games. Kariya has 44 assists for 58 points, a 2.9 average, in 20 league games. Penalties? One, for two minutes.   Rankings   The voters in The Albany Times Union's poll, 12 coaches and 13 news media representatives, still like Maine. The Black Bears gained 24 first-place votes. The other vote went to No. 2 Michigan. Harvard is No. 3; Miami of Ohio, No. 4 and Boston University, No. 5.    Then come Minnesota-Duluth, No. 6; Lake Superior State, No. 7; Wisconsin, No. 8; Rensselaer, No. 9, and Clarkson and Minnesota tied for No. 10.     The poll ran counter to the Central Association standing, which finds Miami of Ohio continuing in first place with a 3-point lead over Lake Superior State and Michigan. The latter two meet on Friday at Ann Arbor, Mich. Women's Tournament  College hockey for women is making steady progress, according to Heather Linstad, the Northeastern coach. \"The caliber of players is improving,\" she said. \"And there are many more opportunties, like our national team and participation in the Olympic festival.\"    The Eastern College Athletic Association is sponsoring its first women's tournament, which begins tonight with St. Lawrence (6-6) at New Hampshire (10-4-2) and Princeton (8-7-2) at Northeastern (9-4-2). Rensselaer  The Engineers are a team to watch as the playoffs near. They have won 9 of their last 11 games, which included Harvard's only league defeat. The defense that supports goalie Neil Little gave up more than three goals only once, a 5-2 loss to Vermont.   Rensselaer, second behind Harvard in the ECAC standing and 1 point ahead of Yale, next plays ninth-place Colgate and 11th-place Cornell at home, while the slumping Bulldogs are at Clarkson and St. Lawrence. SUNY Tournament  Plattsburgh's Cardinals, the defending Division III champions, swept through the State University of New York league with an 11-0-1 record.    Next comes a four-team tournament Friday and Saturday in a two-game format, with 10-minute mini-games to break ties. Oswego State (12-12-1 over all and 5-7-0 in the conference) plays at Plattsburgh (19-4-2, 11-0-1), and Fredonia (11-13-1, 7-4-1) visits Cortland State (17-7-0, 8-4-0).

It should be said at once, before those issues are broached, that Crawford deserves the attention. Her few works achieve a sharply individual tone, a singular blend of lyrical grace and modernist violence.    \"American Visionary\" was the tag that Cheryl Seltzer and Joel Sachs, Continuum's directors, chose for the evening. For once, the phrase applies.  Crawford makes nonsense of the standard chronology of 20th-century music. Her early works inhabit a lushly dissonant medium derived not from Schoenberg but from Scriabin.  The violin sonata of 1926, performed by Renee Jolles (violinist) and Ms. Seltzer (pianist), opens with stark dissonances but finds an ecstatic lyrical tone.

It was a game that saw Pat Riley ejected for the first time as New York's coach with 9:27 left to play, but the Knicks still rallied and overcame what had been a horrendous performance for three and a half quarters.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930225","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/25/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-462393.html","abstract":"  Marina  The Ballroom 253 West 28th Street Chelsea Through Tuesday    The appearance of Marina, a 37-year-old singer, songwriter and guitarist in the Ballroom's annual Brazilian series is the closest the festival has come this year to acknowledging the existence of a younger, rock-oriented generation of pop personalities.

The resulting pieces, four in handcarved pine with horsehair and one in cast steel, are the most commanding and emotionally complex she has made. In addition, the idiosyncratic feminist subtext that has always lurked within Ms. Shea's work is clearer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930226","headline":"Women Don't Yet Form Law School Majority; Forgotten Fiascos","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/opinion/l-women-don-t-yet-form-law-school-majority-forgotten-fiascos-927293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Does President Clinton really \"desperately need a victory, as quickly as possible\" -- following his selections for Attorney General, as you would have us believe in \"Case of Double Jeopardy,\" your Feb. 6 front-page news analysis?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930226","headline":"Sounds Around Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/arts/sounds-around-town-429793.html","abstract":"  Zahn Sings Leigh   Sara Zahn in \"Young at Heart,\" Eighty-Eight's, 228 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-0088. Carolyn Leigh, 28 of whose songs (including \"Young at Heart\") are featured in Sara Zahn's new act, wrote the sauciest lyrics this side of Cole Porter. In her serenely measured performances, Ms. Zahn, whose previous acts have looked deeply into the theater songs of Leonard Bernstein and Charles Strouse, focuses on Leigh's craft and lets the sex speak for itself. The program features a number of unpublished gems and has one conceptual coup, a version of \"Real Live Girl\" sung as a lullaby to a baby. Show time is tonight at 8:30 P.M.

The only traditional Ugandan group of its kind in the United States, the Kiyira Ensemble makes its New York debut in a concert of the African country's traditional songs of work, courtship and entertainment. The instrumentation features local adaptations of the lyre, harp, xylophone, thumb piano and one-string fiddle. Mr. Makubuya, the director of the nine-member group, is a master of several of the instruments. Show time is Saturday at 8 P.M. Tickets: $15.

Its centerpiece is a comic re-enactment of the scene from the Maurice Chevalier-Jeanette MacDonald movie \"Love Me Tonight,\" in which \"Isn't It Romantic?\" was introduced. \"Noel and Cole,\" at 11:30 P.M. both nights, affectionately contrasts the songwriting careers and personalities of Noel Coward and Cole Porter, whose wit and elegance have always linked them stylistically as Anglo-American cousins.

Long before it was fashionable, the Meat Puppets were promoting a kind of nouveau-hippie youth revolution. Over the course of 12 years and nearly as many releases, this Arizona trio has meandered from hardcore to country to grunge and back again, switching between long, dizzy guitar improvisations and head-banging, hair-shaking metal; the lyrics are odes to a perennial state of pleasant confusion. Tonight and tomorrow night, the Puppets play an acoustic set at 9, which will highlight some of the melodic subtleties of their countryish side; their electric set, at midnight, might come off like a cross between Pearl Jam and the Grateful Dead. Admission: $10. Bodeco at CBGB     Bodeco, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. There's nothing quaint, cute or five-and-dime about Bodeco's brand of rockabilly. Greasy as a truck-stop burger and bumpier than a high-speed ride in the back of a pickup, this band of Louisville wild men eschews retro contrivances in favor of gristle, marrow and the occasional backwoods yowl. Choice cuts from \"Bone, Hair and Hide,\" Bodeco's 1992 release on the independent label Homestead, include \"Hong Kong, Mississippi,\" \"Holy Rollers Rockin' in a Killin' Machine\" and \"Casillero del Diablo.\" Also on tomorrow night's bill are the Friggs, an all-female dance-party garage band, and the Lyres, longstanding defenders of the late-60's punk ethic. Music starts around 9:30 P.M. Admission: $8. Distortion With Melody    Polvo, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. These days, no self-respecting young guitar band would go far without packing a little distortion, but Polvo dispenses with it more sparingly than most. Substituting flowery melodic phrases for chopped-up chords, and relegating monotone vocals to the back seat, Polvo emphasizes atmosphere over action, obscurity over clarity. Most of the band's songs seem to be about sitting around the house, but lyrics aren't really the point here; it's the hazy, pretty guitar lines that are supposed to ignite the imagination and take the listener along on the ride.
