the first-person accounts of bouts with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The young women who deliver them may not fully understand the roots of their compulsion to starve or stuff themselves, but their vivid memories leave no doubt of its power and the deep unhappiness from which it springs.   Their straightforward descriptions are in contrast to the visual pretensions and theoretical mishmash that fill much of the rest of this 90-minute Canadian documentary, which was shown on Cinemax last year. Most of it is devoted not to illnesses associated with food, but to the more general question of why so many women can't stand being fat. Starting with the proposition that an obsession with thinness prevails in North America -- where 5-foot-4-inch, 140-pound women dream of being 5-10 and 110 pounds -- the program serves up a miscellany of purportedly expert opinions on why this is so, from the points of view of a Jungian psychoanalyst, a professor of women's studies and assorted psychologists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930811","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/11/nyregion/news-summary-377593.html","abstract":"  International A2-9  COMMANDOS MAY GO TO SOMALIA  The U.S. is considering using commandos in Somalia to search for Gen.

Both works were composed -- indeed, both composers had died -- well before Haydn and Mozart were born. Both are steeped in the elegance of the French Baroque style (alloyed, in Purcell's case, with English traditions), which both Mozart and Haydn would have regarded as hopelessly archaic. And given the 18th century's preoccupation with new music, there is reason to suppose that both Mozart and Haydn went through their lives without hearing either work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930811","headline":"On Eve of Strike, Nigeria Detains Opponents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/11/world/on-eve-of-strike-nigeria-detains-opponents.html","abstract":"  Nigeria's military Government has detained dozens of opponents and imposed tight controls on the press as a three-day protest of the annulment of June's elections approaches.
