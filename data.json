Such an amendment would be a political mistake. It would allow a mere 40 out of 100 senators and a similar minority in the House to block legislation that would create a deficit. And because the amendment includes no enforcement procedure, it would drag courts where they do not belong -- into routine budget disputes.   Fiddling with the Constitution could be defensible if a mighty public purpose were at stake. But Mr. Simon's amendment, and substitute versions also up for voting, would engrave into the Constitution a standard -- zero deficits -- that makes little economic sense. The deficit, as measured by Congress, takes no account of inflation, no account of growth, no account of recession and no account of the value of public investment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940228","headline":"After Triple Slaying, Survivors Face Life and Fear; At a Bronx Restaurant, Where Kin and Workers Were Slain, a Task of Rebuilding","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/28/nyregion/after-triple-slaying-survivors-face-life-fear-bronx-restaurant-where-kin-workers.html","abstract":"  For Genaro Parra, memory returns with every glance at the putty-filled bullet holes that dot the blue Formica counter in his restaurant.

At Irving Plaza on Thursday night, the English band sounded like at least half a dozen other groups, from U2 to Dexys Midnight Runners to the Soft Boys to INXS to Midnight Oil to the Hollies. What holds the band's music together is its consistent nervous energy -- ballads are rare -- and an attitude that's bratty and cynical, steeped in pessimism but willing to spare a bitter laugh.   Miles Hunt, the band's singer and lyricist, doesn't mince words as he bawls them. He lashes out in all directions; during the set, songs denounced radio disk jockeys, pedophiles, deceitful lovers, a would-be \"disco king\" and the singer himself. Most songs have a chip on their shoulder, even when it's not clear exactly who the target is. But Mr. Hunt attacks with a defiant grin, backed by all sorts of ringing guitar riffs, moving from folk-rock to the verge of hard rock, sometimes allowing a rural touch with the fiddle or mandolin of Martin Bell.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940228","headline":"Red Cross to Urge U.N. to Adopt A Complete Ban on Land Mines","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/28/world/red-cross-to-urge-un-to-adopt-a-complete-ban-on-land-mines.html","abstract":"  The International Committee of the Red Cross, at a meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Committee on Monday in Geneva, plans to call for a complete ban on the use of antipersonnel mines.

Six years after his death, Feldman remains both famous and unknown.  No longer overshadowed by his onetime mentor John Cage, he has become hugely influential within certain creative circles; younger composers study him intently, and the adjective \"Feldmanesque\" has entered the lexicon of anyone writing about contemporary music.

A series of recent studies suggest that this B vitamin may be a major player in warding off heart attacks, strokes and certain common cancers. Even in people not now considered deficient in the vitamin, a less than optimal intake can double or triple the risk of developing one or more of these killer diseases.   Often called folacin or folate (its biologically active form), folic acid is already well established as critically important in preventing spina bifida and anencephaly, both devastating birth defects of the neural tube. A nationwide effort is under way urging women to take supplements containing folic acid and to increase their intake of folate-rich foods, like dark green leafy vegetables, before becoming pregnant as well as during the first months of pregnancy. This is especially important for women who have been taking oral contraceptives, which interfere with the body's use of folic acid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940301","headline":"1944:Victory in Burma : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/opinion/IHT-1944victory-in-burma-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW DELHI - [From our New York edition:] The Allies have scored their first major victory in Burma by destroying a special force of 8,000 Japanese in two weeks of confused fighting in the dusty, choking jungle of the Arakan sector, north of Akyab, the Sou","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940301","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/nyregion/metro-digest-325902.html","abstract":"  NEW YORK CITY  OFF OF WELFARE, BUT AT WHAT COST?

The 9-to-0 decision resolved a long-festering issue in copyright law by creating a level playing field for plaintiffs and defendants on the subject of lawyers' fees. Before today, several Federal appeals courts had applied a dual standard under which winning plaintiffs were almost routinely reimbursed for their fees but successful defendants had to show that the lawsuit was frivolous or brought in bad faith before their lawyers' fees were repaid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940302","headline":"For Kent, Offense Is the Best Defense","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/02/sports/baseball-for-kent-offense-is-the-best-defense.html","abstract":"  Jeff Kent will never be a Gold Glove second baseman.

Governor Cuomo prides himself on wearing no person's -- or party's -- leash.
