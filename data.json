CHIASSON What happens is that because health center districts are fairly small and the number of infant deaths is quite small in each of the districts, the rates are very unstable. And if you look at, for instance, just a simple graph of the infant mortality rate in Central Harlem over time, you'll see that the actual line bounces up and down all over the place. . . .

Does Mr. Taruskin really have scientific proof that atonality stinks? Of course not.

Not even Harvey Blissberg, the Boston Red Sox outfielder who turned private detective when he got too old to play the game. How old is that? you ask. Well, in Richard Rosen's WORLD OF HURT (Walker, $20.95), a lippy cop describes Harvey's face as \"too old for a baseball card but not old enough for plastic surgery.\" Which makes him nicely seasoned for the job he takes on for his brother, Norm: to find out who killed a real estate agent who played on Norm's pickup basketball team in an affluent Chicago suburb.   The foreign terrain of the Midwest brings out all the best instincts of this smart sleuth, whose quiet intelligence and dry wit have been much missed since his last appearance six years ago in \"Saturday Night Dead.\" Harvey's mental notes on the regional suburban culture are every bit as striking as his keen insights into characters like the desperately bored housewife -- gallantly described as \"a woman of some substance, some intelligence, some irony\" -- with whom he has a brief, debasing sexual encounter. The sights that catch Harvey's eye are homely but unnerving, from the resident \"suicidologist\" installed at a local high school to the meticulously groomed split-level homes in which he glimpses \"people growing older inside their houses.\" A thinking man like that -- no wonder Harvey was always so lonely in the outfield.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Keeping Reserves Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/realestate/your-home-keeping-reserves-sound.html","abstract":"  THE lobby is shabby.

Longwood's story is one of neighborhood preservation and grass-roots politics. In the late 1970's, when Thomas Bess and Marilyn Smith, two longtime residents, founded the Longwood Historic District Community Association, the neighborhood was full of deserted lots whose buildings had long since burned. Around that time this part of the South Bronx became saddled with a name that resounded as a symbol of urban terror: Fort Apache.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Mason Gets Into the Act As Syracuse Runs Wild","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/sports/football-mason-gets-into-the-act-as-syracuse-runs-wild.html","abstract":"  The Syracuse tailbacks, who have built a reputation of formidable proportions this season, ran wild again this afternoon.

Just be sure you have my tie right.\" The comment is emblematic of Joyce. JOYCE IMAGES (Norton, $39.95), a book of photographs and drawings edited by Greg Vitello, whose previous books include \"Twenty Years of Masterpiece Theater,\" reaffirms the face of the family man who was one incarnation of James Joyce (1882-1941) -- but the heart of the radical artist who saw life so intensely eludes this collection. Despite an excellent essay by Anthony Burgess on Joyce's life and work, completed shortly before Burgess's death in 1993, \"Joyce Images\" oddly reaffirms the limitations of the visual record. Five photographs of Joyce by Josef Breitenbach, published for the first time, take their place beside well-known portraits by Man Ray, Berenice Abbott, Gisele Freund and Augustus John. One wishes for more text. The famous photograph of four generations of Joyces -- James; his son, Giorgio; and his grandson, Stephen, seated beneath Tuohy's portrait of Joyce's own father -- has a deeper significance if we know that Joyce considered a father \"a necessary evil.\" Photographs of Joyce's daughter, Lucia, show an enigmatic, and lovely, young woman. She was ultimately lost to schizophrenia and confinement in mental hospitals, and Joyce believed it was she who had inherited his genius. Her brilliantly rendered drawing of her father is especially poignant because it demonstrates such fine control. The family record is brought more happily up to date with a photograph of the writer's only living descendant, Stephen Joyce. He is pictured with his wife, Solange Raytchine Joyce, who wears the \"Love is unhappy when love is away\" necklace that Joyce had made for Nora Barnacle in 1909. Recent drawings by Robert Motherwell and David Levine attest to the continuing fascination with Joyce. The admiration and reverence of other writers is documented by F. Scott Fitzgerald's whimsical cartoon of Joyce at a dinner party in 1928 and by one of the book's closing photographs, of Ezra Pound's visit to Joyce's grave site in Zurich shortly before Pound's own death in 1972. The homage paid by one great writer to another is a fitting image with which to end a book about a man who is ultimately accessible only through his own words.\nJOELLE ZOIS","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Dr. Daruwalla's Quest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/books/l-dr-daruwalla-s-quest-453170.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I thoroughly enjoyed reading Robert Towers's review of John Irving's latest novel, \"A Son of the Circus\" (Sept. 4).

As Ken Burns pointed out in his television documentary, there is nothing new in this year's confrontation: player-owner animosity is as old as the professional game itself. I agree with Rhoden's column: baseball is bigger than either the players or owners.   I saw my first game in 1936 -- the Giants-Dodgers, Hubbell versus Mungo. I have been playing, coaching, umpiring and, most important, watching baseball ever since. Today each game is as fresh and new to me as the first one almost 60 years ago.

I had never paid them much attention before. For reasons of righteousness or repression or both, I had little experience with pornography, so going into the shops (at night, of course), getting stacks of quarters from amiably bored young attendants, closing myself into private viewing booths and surfing through channels of men and women in various combos acting out sexual fantasies was perhaps a bigger deal for me than for most. And that may well have contributed to my post-game, first-draft opinion -- no big deal. Because I had seen no violence and no children in the pictures, I wondered if porn wasn't less of a clear and present danger than football.   In this column's spirit of interactivity (more and more topics are suggested by readers, some of whom stop me on the street), I asked for second opinions. I was surprised by their number and intensity and range. There was much rage expressed at my \"insensitivity to the degradation of women\" in this current backlash rash of strip joints, Calvin Klein ads, and movie mayhem.

It is a coloratura showpiece in which Lakme, the daughter of an Indian Brahmin, imitates the tinkling of a magician's bell. The song is also supposed to have magical power, to lure the imperialist English soldier who has violated the holy ground of a Hindu temple and captured Lakme's heart. In her realm, the fluid world of dream holds sway. In his realm, responsibility and duty have their claims. The Bell Song is a musical bridge between the two cultures; even its words speak of connecting disjointed worlds.    Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but many of this season's operatic offerings have similar preoccupations with the meeting of cultures. The City Opera is presenting Borodin's \"Prince Igor,\" a tale of medieval confrontations with barbarian hordes who seem to threaten Russia with either seduction or annihilation.

His cooking is based on his brilliant use of fresh vegetable juices and flavored oils for his sauces rather than butter or cream. Fall, he says, is most distinctive for the richness of its smells and tastes, from boar and venison to truffles, wild mushrooms, root vegetables and dried berries. His fall menu includes starters like seared scallops with a tartare of beets and parsley juice, and sauteed sweetbreads with chestnuts and a drizzle of truffle vinaigrette.

The next morning, Brooks Atkinson, the New York Times drama critic, called it \"the most beautifully blended musical show we have seen in this country.\" The first three songs in Act I -- \"Make-Believe,\" \"Ol' Man River\" and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,\" sung in quick, dazzling succession after the overture, knocked theatergoers for a loop. \"Show Boat,\" the smash hit, went on to become a revered institution, the much-analyzed, seminal work that forever changed the American musical theater. That's a heavy load to bear.    Harold Prince faces the task head on in the pristine new production at the Gershwin Theater. The astonishing thing about Mr. Prince's \"Show Boat\" is not its opulence, its cast of 71, its determinedly correct social consciousness or its often striking use of cinematic techniques. The show looks lavish, but looks count for little over the span of a performance that lasts nearly three hours. Rather you'll be stunned and swept effortlessly along by the melodic variety and intensity of the score, which predates the gorgeous Richard Rodgers-Hammerstein \"Carousel\" score by 18 years, and can still upstage it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/playing-in-the-neighborhood-467391.html","abstract":"  MIDTOWN Cross an Ocean But Stay in Town   Every two years, the Ocean Liner Museum -- which has 500 members but no fixed home -- finds the space and puts together an exhibit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Bodega as Bawdy House: Old Law for New Problem","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-bodega-bawdy-house-old-law-for-new-problem.html","abstract":"  For more than two years now, neighbors of the New Way, a bodega on the southeast corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 107th Street, have known that plantains and oranges were not the only things being sold from the wooden shelves in front.   \"It was not like they were trying to hide it at all,\" said one woman, a 50-year-old artist who can see the bodega from her window. \"There were guys out there flaunting huge wads of cash, being really in-your-face about it.\" The woman, like others in the area who had joined forces to try to stop the flourishing drug trade, did not want her name used for fear of retribution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Tina M.

The manicured grass that stretches far beyond the 100 yards of the football field and the shockingly sunny skies created a perfect autumn setting for two schools that should be fiercer rivals.

Completed by Marion Mainwaring. Penguin, $10.95. When the author died in 1937, she left this work unfinished. Readers were left wondering what became of Nan St. George, a young American who made an unhappy marriage to a dull English duke and then dared to leave him. Marion Mainwaring's addition of new chapters has resulted in \"a fairy-tale novel, miraculously returned to life,\" Wendy Steiner said here last year.  TRAVELS WITH LIZBETH By Lars Eighner. Fawcett Columbine, $11. For a number of authors, homelessness has been an experiment, an experience to be tried and then written about. For Lars Eighner, it was no literary choice. This chronicle, selected as one of the best books of 1993 by the editors of The New York Times Book Review, describes the three years in the 1980's that Mr. Eighner, jobless and destitute, spent on the road with his dog, a Labrador mix named Lizbeth. Our reviewer, Jonathan Raban, said, \"If there's any justice in the world it should guarantee its author a roof over his head for the rest of his days.\"  TROUBLE By Fay Weldon. Penguin, $10.95. There's plenty of it in the life of Annette Horrocks, a first-time novelist: She's pregnant and her husband, Spicer, has rejected her in favor of New Age psychotherapy and extramarital affairs. For her humorous adventures \"we must praise and thank Ms. Weldon and her wicked pen,\" Tama Janowitz said here last year.  EXIT INTO HISTORY: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe By Eva Hoffman. Penguin, $11.95. The author investigates the cultures of six countries that used to be part of the Communist bloc, including her own homeland, Poland. She concludes that their identities are too often reductively described. Last year our reviewer, Robert D. Kaplan, said, \"Ms. Hoffman's book provokes fresh imaginings about a part of Europe where change is just beginning to unfold.\"  21 SUGAR STREET By Lynn Lauber. Norton, $10. This first novel centers on two characters from the author's collection of short fiction, \"White Girls.\" In 1970 Loretta Dardio, a white teen-ager in love with a black man, Luther Biggs, is forced to give up their baby daughter for adoption. Their story is \"wisely observed and well written,\" Mark Childress said here last year.  THE GOLDEN THIRTEEN: Recollections of the First Black Naval Officers Edited by Paul Stillwell. Berkley, $15. During World War II, the Navy finally allowed black men to become officers. But such progress did little to halt racist behavior. Last year our reviewer, William H. Honan, called these reminiscences -- from the eight survivors of the original 13 black officers and from three white commanders -- \"fascinating and moving.\" Racial prejudice in the military is also explored in ASSAULT AT WEST POINT: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker, by John F. Marszalek (Collier/Macmillan, $12), an account of the experiences of the third black man to enter the academy. Originally titled \"Court Martial,\" the book tells how Whittaker, a former slave, was court-martialed in 1881 for supposedly faking a brutal assault against him. \"It reads like a well-paced courtroom fiction,\" The Book Review said in 1973.  THREE NOVELS: The Deep, Beasts, Engine Summer By John Crowley. Bantam, $12.95. This volume gathers together early science fiction works by a master of the genre. In \"The Deep,\" John Crowley's first novel, warring societies on an Earthlike planet are visited by an emissary on a strange mission. In 1977 our reviewer, Gerald Jonas, said, \"Paraphrase is useless to convey the intensity\" of the prose. \"Beasts\" takes place in an anarchic future in which the United States no longer exists and a new species -- part lion, part man -- plays an important role. The author \"displays a prodigious inventiveness,\" Mr. Jonas said here in 1976. There is still another post-apocalyptic vision in \"Engine Summer.\" In 1979 our reviewer, again Mr. Jonas, praised its \"ingenious, well-made plot.\"  THE CIVIL WAR By Geoffrey C. Ward, with Ric Burns and Ken Burns. Vintage, $13. This edition of the companion volume to the acclaimed 1990 PBS series doesn't have the photographs that appeared in the hardcover, but it faithfully reproduces the text, which includes narratives by politicians, soldiers and slaves. It is \"thoroughly researched\" and \"vividly written,\" David Haward Bain said here. A particularly poignant passage in Civil War history is chronicled in THE LAST FULL MEASURE: The Life and Death of the First Minnesota Volunteers, by Richard Moe (Avon, $15), the story of the 262-man regiment assigned the suicidal task of stopping the huge force of Confederate soldiers who were about to divide the Union Army at Gettysburg. Last year our reviewer, Richard E. Nich olls, called it \"a vigorous, haunting celebration.\" Also reissued is WITHOUT CONSENT OR CONTRACT: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery, by Robert William Fogel (Norton, $14.95), which expands upon the theses of the author's 1974 book, \"Time on the Cross.\" This history acknowledges slavery's horrors while analyzing the sometimes questionable moral practices of its abolitionist opponents. \"Mr. Fogel has the good judgment to moderate the polemical tone\" of his earlier work, C. Vann Woodward said here in 1989.  TONY AND SUSAN By Austin Wright. Warner, $5.99. Susan Morrow's ex-husband has returned to her life: he wants her to comment on his first novel. Last year our reviewer, Brendan Bernhard, called this fiction \"a brain-teasing page turner.\" LAUREL GRAEBER","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"A Vermont Hospital Turns Its Garbage Into Gold","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/cuttings-a-vermont-hospital-turns-its-garbage-into-gold.html","abstract":"  AS a gardener, I often wonder how many tons of carrot tops, potato skins and unserved meals from my office cafeteria are thrown into the garbage every day.

The 78th Precinct is trying to stymie the latter not by arresting the prostitutes, but by aggressively pursuing their customers. The police mark those who gravitate to Third Avenue near DeGraw Street, in the Gowanus section, an area that bustles in the daylight hours with factory life but that draws a less savory form of business once the sun sets.   The precinct is the latest one to begin campaigns in which potential customers are arrested when they approach female police officers posing as prostitutes.   In one police operation, customers' cars are confiscated, in a rare application of a state forfeiture law usually used to seize cars used in drug deals.   The police crackdown began in the Public Morals Division in January 1991, with the hope of curbing spots throughout the city where prostitution was a particular problem. In 1993, the division arrested 581 people for soliciting decoys, and impounded 181 automobiles.   This past summer, the division began training individual precincts to conduct independent stings.   So far, several precincts have started their own programs, and find that they are successful at nabbing customers and vexing them with the car seizures. But it is unclear whether the drive actually slows business.   In Prospect Park, for example, officers go out once a week for a few hours, rotating randomly between simple arrests and the confiscation of cars, and have found that they can barely keep up with the number of customers, said Capt. Richard Rosa of the 78th Precinct.   \"It takes us two hours to pick up 10 cars,\" said Captain Rosa. \"In one night, we had 20 bodies in three hours. We had a medical doctor -- you think he'd know better -- to middle-class to working-class guys,\" he said.   Once the customers are arrested, the captain said he is forced to keep the female decoy officers nearby, or else other potential customers try to pick them up while they are busy with their initial arrest. \"We roll up with lights flashing, sirens going; you think they would get the message,\" said Captain Rosa, whose unit has made 70 arrests and confiscated 32 cars since mid-August.    The officers, usually two or three each time, are scantily clad and are wired, so that when approached, they can tape a conversation, Captain Rosa explained.    The officers never proposition a man, but will ask them what they want. \"As soon as monetary money is mentioned, we just pull up and get them,\" he said.   A suspect is generally booked, then released, but must appear in court the next day, where he is usually issued a summons. The cost of recovering a car can be 20 percent of its value.

End of story.   But is it? No, and the plot line has been unraveling for some time. Now a new book, \"As Seen on TV: The Visual Culture of Everyday Life in the 1950's,\" extends the revision. It is by Karal Ann Marling, an art historian and a professor of American studies at the University of Minnesota. Her account doesn't have much to do with Pollock or de Kooning. But it has a great deal to do with Winston Churchill, Claudette Colbert and a forgotten businessman named Max Klein.   As Marling describes it, in a chapter titled \"Hyphenated Culture,\" the 50's wasn't a decade defined by a small band of Greenwich Village abstractionists struggling to fame despite a hostile public. It was a decade of unprecedented interest in painting. Everyone was at it. Ike was in the White House with the television on, painting copies of greeting cards (up to 7 in 10 days!). Hollywood stars promoted themselves as weekend dabblers. Sinatra painted clowns, Fonda plums, Colbert portraits. A traveling show featured art by celebrities like Joe Louis and Clifton Webb.   Another exhibition that toured the country showcased art by businessmen. One man whose work was in it, a New York City clothing manufacturer, said he had been inspired by Irving Stone's biography of van Gogh, \"Lust for Life,\" a surprise best seller when reissued in 1946. Specifically, he said, his painting \"borrowed from the violent style of that tortured master.\" Van Gogh, that is, not Stone.   The rest of the country, it seemed, was painting by numbers. I don't know about you, but the paint-by-numbers craze always seemed to me -- as it did to 50's social commentators, who heaped scorn on it -- somewhere between Hula-Hoops and Davy Crockett on the scale of cultural signifiers. But maybe not. It doesn't require a relativism that would equate Mighty Morphin Power Rangers with Valkyries to see how serious painting and painting by numbers spoke to the same moment in American cultural life. At the least, Abstract Expressionists rose to postwar stardom partly on the tide of a popular mania for painting -- even if they had to be cast as charlatans to do so.   So great was the public's enthusiasm for painting by numbers that one entrepreneur told Business Week in 1953: \"We pray a little, keep our fingers crossed, and hope that when the herd finally turns to glass blowing, enough will stay behind to keep us in business. In the meantime, we're cleaning up.\"   You may feel edified to learn that a great work like Leonardo's \"Last Supper,\" at $11.50, was the all-time favorite among paint-by-numbers hobbyists. Until you discover that \"Three Kittens,\" produced by Picture Craft, a company headed by Max Klein, was a big hit, too. Klein started a \"Masterpiece\" line that included nudes and celebrity portraits. A Picture Craft ad said: \"Decorate Your Home . . . or Sell Your Paintings for Profit.\" Sure enough, judges at a San Francisco art show were even fooled into awarding one a prize.   \"Do-it-yourselfism,\" writes Marling, \"was the last refuge for the exercise of control and competence in a world run by the bosses and the bureaucrats.\" She points to the influence of Churchill as amateur painter, and particularly to his popular book, published in America in 1948, \"Painting as a Pastime.\" In it he extolled the therapeutic value of putting down \"large fierce strokes.\"   \"Churchill's insistence that art was cheap psychotherapy or a way of releasing pent-up feelings found some resonance in the 'splash and wallop' technique of the Abstract Expressionists,\" observes Marling.   Here you have it. Paint-by-numbers enthusiasts and Abstract Expressionists alike were affected by the same 50's Zeitgeist: the tension between social strictures and personal freedom. When the critic Harold Rosenberg famously described de Kooning and others as Action Painters, he was, on a highfalutin level, echoing the widespread belief that art was a form of release.   Of course, there was only so much releasing that most Americans could take -- hence the preference for painting that nonetheless stayed within the lines prescribed by Klein & Co.   Abstraction was O.K. when it came to those asteroid shapes and squiggly forms on the new Formica kitchen counter tops. But Grandma Moses' treacly pictures were what the average Joe wanted on his walls. Moses, an autodidact, ideally suited a decade of do-it-yourselfers and paint-by-numbers hobbyists.   Moreover, she painted homespun fantasies of a bygone country. If art was a means of escaping the new corporate grind, her paintings epitomized escapism. Little wonder she was dubbed America's most beloved artist or that in 1950 the United States Information Agency, to hype American culture, sent her works to Europe -- where the French and others received them warmly, to the horror of America's art establishment.   We do well to remember that the art stars of the period, besides Moses, included Ben Shahn and John Marin. In exalted circles, praised was lavished on them during the postwar years. In 1950, Marin had a retrospective at the Venice Biennale; in 1954 Shahn had one (as did de Kooning).   The Museum of Modern Art put those Venice shows together. But it wasn't until late 1956 that it presented a one-person show of an Abstract Expressionist in New York -- a posthumous tribute to Pollock. A David Smith retrospective in 1957 and a survey called \"The New American Painting,\" which toured Europe in '58 and came here the next year, were the only other shows exclusively dedicated to Abstract Expressionism that the museum mounted during the entire decade.    The point is that Abstract Expressionists didn't simply take charge during the postwar period. For much of it, they weren't even the main event. And their rise is better understood against the backdrop of Shahn and Marin, of Moses and the paint-by-numbers craze, than in a vacuum.   American art in the 50's turned out to be a tango of High and Low: Pollock, dancing around drip paintings in a studio at the end of Long Island, partnered with Gene Kelly, dancing around in his beret as the artist in \"An American in Paris\" (a 1951 film). The history of postwar American art, far from a closed book, has only started to be written.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"Corporate Giants Weigh Moving Headquarters to the County","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/corporate-giants-weigh-moving-headquarters-to-the-county.html","abstract":"WESTCHESTER'S economy, troubled by corporate downsizing and move-outs in the last few years, could get healthy quickly if some major corporations in Manhattan decide to pull up stakes and move to Westchester. \n\nAt least three large New York City-based companies are engaged in separate studies of the Westchester and northern suburban office markets, which could include Fairfield County and sites in New Jersey, to determine whether they will move their headquarters out of Manhattan.

The polls are preliminary and the pundits fallible, and when we all wake up on Nov. 9 the Democrats, though shaken, may still have slim majorities. But if things do turn out badly, it will be partly because Bill Clinton and the Democrats have failed to persuade the American people that they can govern as a party.   This failure of governance is rarely mentioned in the litany of causes for the Democrats' discontent. The most common suspects are: a nagging, nationwide sense of economic discomfort.

The Americans will face England, which won all nine of its matches in the first three rounds, in one semifinal today. The other semifinal in the $1.5 million event will pit South Africa against Canada. Tom Kite shot a three-under 69 and took advantage of bogeys by Grant Waite on the last two holes to win by two shots. Curtis Strange (69) beat Frank Nobilo by one, and Fred Couples (72) survived a bogey at No. 17 to defeat Greg Turner by two. The results left the Americans and Irish, who beat Japan by 2-1, tied atop the Group One standing with two victories each, but the United States advanced because it had six victories in individual games to Ireland's five. (AP) U.S. Is Back in Lead: Tiger Woods's five-under-par 67 boosted the United States back into the lead of the world amateur team championships in La Boulie, France. With three of four individual scores counting, the Americans finished the third round with a 16-under 629 total, one better than a team of golfers from Britain and Ireland and four better than Australia. Woods, 18, said a tip from a golf writer -- that his hip turn was too big -- helped him shoot eight birdies and three bogeys on his third trip over the 6,734-yard French National layout. Allen Doyle, a veteran of amateur play, shot a 69. Todd Demsey shot 71 and John Harris a 72 for Americans. The best round of the tournament came from 21-year-old Jason Dawes of Australia, who shot a course-record nine-under 63.

China has 62 gold medals, followed by 24 for South Korea, which won in archery, shooting and its native taekwondo. Japan has 22 after winning in bowling and men's swimming. In the pool, the world-record holder Le Jingyi was disqualified for a false start in the 50-meter freestyle and Lu Bin raced to victory in 25.68 seconds for her fourth gold.

Westminster is 3-0.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"On Equality In School Financing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/09/nyregion/l-on-equality-in-school-financing-474207.html","abstract":"  Regarding the recent article \"Opinions Vary on School Ruling,\" may I comment on the remarks made by a lawyer who is quoted as saying that she found the recent Supreme Court decision on equality spending on N.J. school districts \"extremely frustrating.\"   I note with chagrin her expression of this in that she would have to fund not only her own children's education, but also \". . . everyone's education.

The play at the Forum Theater is critic-proof, which means it is unaffected by the unkindness of reviewers who cannot get over the habit of differentiating between meticulous and mushy comic writing. It also means that some audiences take to it; more aptly put, kvell over it. If you don't know what kvell means, it isn't likely that you'll take to \"Beau Jest.\" Not that a knowledge of Yiddish guarantees that you will.   The play's setup suggests another take on the 1922 hit \"Abie's Irish Rose,\" regenerated to, say, 1946. Sarah Goldman, a Jewish kindergarten teacher, hires Bob Schroeder, an actor employed by the state-licensed Heaven Sent Escort Agency, to be a pretend boyfriend when her presumably Orthodox parents are coming to dinner. They disapprove of her real beau (Chris -- believe it -- Kringle), who is not Jewish. To go all out at dinner, Bob not only plays a doctor but a surgeon, Dr. David Steinberg. \"What kind of surgeon?\" he is asked. \"Whatever comes up,\" he answers. \"Hearts. Brains.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941009","headline":"C.I.A.

Andretti, driving in his 407th and last Indy-car race at age 54, had a frustrating day, damaging his car in a first-lap accident and winding up 18th after his engine blew just three laps from the end. He wound up watching from the pits as Tracy took the checkered flag. \"I'm just going to have to find out if there is life after driving after all,\" Andretti said. \"And I'm sure there is.\" The day quickly turned from one of nostalgia for Andretti to the brutal realities of racing. On Lap 1, in the third turn, Michael Andretti, Mario's eldest son, was sidelined and the father's car was damaged in a multicar melee. (AP) After 56 Races, a Victory: Dale Jarrett broke a 55-race streak in which he failed to make the winner's circle yesterday by shooting past Morgan Shepherd with less than four laps left and holding on to win the Mello Yello 500 in a wild finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. His third career victory, and first since the 1993 Daytona 500, came one week after Jarrett had failed to qualify for the race at North Wilkesboro, N.C. \"I was at the bottom of the ocean last Sunday,\" Jarrett said. \"We have too good a team to not at least make a race. But I think that gave everybody a good wake-up call.\" Shepherd wound up second and Dale Earnhardt, who finished third, took a big step forward in his bid for a seventh Winston Cup season driving title. (AP) GOLF  Canada Upsets U.S. to Win Dunhill Cup  Canada took advantage of blunders by Tom Kite and Fred Couples to upset the United States, the defending champion, yesterday and win the Dunhill Cup in St. Andrews, Scotland. Dave Barr (70) defeated Kite, who lost his match by one after making a double bogey on No. 17. Couples missed a 3-foot putt on No. 16 and also ended up one stroke behind Ray Stewart (71). The two Canadian victories made Curtis Strange's seven-shot victory over Rick Gibson meaningless. Strange closed with a sizzling 67. Canada had never before advanced as far as the semifinals.

This weekend, the routine of paying homage to the King with visits to Graceland and small celebrations on the anniversaries of his birth and death was shaken up slightly. Elvis Presley's estate, Graceland, sponsored its first tribute to the King, flying in a small army of pop musicians for a concert and holding the first party at Graceland since Elvis's death.    The tribute did not mark any particular event in Presley's life. It didn't have to. When Elvis calls, his fans respond. Some 17,000 people paid $40 to $550 a seat for the concert at the new Pyramid arena, making Memphis seem like the site of a World's Fair.

But in the last decade, concerts by the American Jazz Orchestra, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band have made the repertory movement a little less earnest than it used to be.

All three need economic ties with the outside world because the plight of their people has become desperate.

How do squirrels find the nuts they have buried?    A.  They seem to have a very good memory for where they put things, said Dr. Lucia Jacobs of the University of Utah, who has studied the matter firsthand.   Wild squirrels' burial behavior gave some clues to the question. In a small-scale study in a 15-acre tract of woods adjoining the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., she focused on gray squirrels dining on hickory nuts. An account of her research was published in Natural History magazine in October 1989.   Before burying a nut, she observed, wild squirrels removed the fragrant husk, reducing the chance of using smell to find it, but also reducing the chance that its hiding place would be obvious to other squirrels. She carefully observed the digging of a hole an inch or two deep. The nut was dropped in, then slowly and painstakingly covered with dirt and camouflaged with ground litter, reducing visual clues to other squirrels.   To address the question of memory, she used hand-reared squirrels allowed out one at a time to bury nuts in an outdoor arena. They were then returned to their cages for 2 to 12 days.    While they were caged, she removed the nuts and put similar fresh ones in their place. She also buried fresh nuts at random sites chosen from those other squirrels had used in the same week.   Given a potential choice between equal numbers of nuts in holes they had dug and nuts in holes dug by other squirrels, Dr. Jacobs found, \"each squirrel retrieved significantly more nuts from sites it had chosen than from other squirrels' hiding places.\" C.

In still another game, he adopted a solid opening but was confronted with superior solidity and ground down.   When a whole series of mishaps like these take place, it is a good bet that overstrained nerves can be blamed. The tension mounts as one goes up the ladder toward a title match, in this case with Gary Kasparov of Russia in late 1995.

A test of this kind could well revolutionize the treatment of malignant disease, if combined with effective methods of attacking early cancers. Other experts say the Johns Hopkins team appears to have made an important laboratory advance toward this goal, but that the work is preliminary and much more remains to be done to make the test available for widespread use, if it ever is.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941011","headline":"General Cedras Departs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/11/opinion/general-cedras-departs.html","abstract":"  With the resignation of Lieut.

Litt, State Department director of Northern Gulf affairs: Mr. Litt's statement that the Administration's report will draw \"heavily on the People's Mujahedeen's own stated views\" is unconvincing. The department has acted to the contrary.   In a Congressional hearing this week, Robert Pelletreau, Assistant Secretary for Near East affairs, asserted the Mujahedeen had acknowledged responsibility for the deaths of American nationals and had taken part in the seizure of American diplomats as hostages in Teheran. Both statements are false. The Mujahedeen have denied both allegations.   Mr. Litt's letter is full of baseless allegations that originate in the Irangate deals and were part of the demands of the Khomeini regime. These allegations have never been substantiated, and have already been answered by the Mujahedeen.   These responses have been ignored by the State Department, whose declared positions over the last six months contradict the objective study needed to prepare the report. The compilers have made up their minds, violating impartiality.   The problem is not the Mujahedeen but those in the State Department who advocate a policy of appeasing Teheran. They view discrediting Iran's democratic oppoosition as the only way to justify reconciliation with an international outlaw.   Congress and the public have made their will known: Don't appease the mullahs, don't prejudge, be objective, listen to all voices, particularly the subjects of the report. This the State Department refuses to do.
