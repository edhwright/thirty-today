The law regulating carriages expired with the new year, and David N. Dinkins vetoed new legislation on his next to last day as Mayor.

Looking at the four hands shown in the diagram, with South facing a trump lead in a three-spade contract, would you choose to play or defend?   After the compulsory one no-trump opening, North-South would have done well to defend, collecting 200 or 300 even without a double. But both North-South pairs busily entered the auction. In one case the French partnership bid to two hearts, which just succeeded. In the other, the American North, Paul Soloway, reopened as shown with two clubs. This showed clubs and spades, and prompted his partner, Bob Goldman, to issue a game invitation with a jump to three spades, reaching a precarious contract.   After a trump lead and a low card from the dummy, the European East, Soldano De Falco, had a problem. If he had made the normal play of the nine, South would have won with king, crossed to the club ace and ruffed a club. Then he would have used the heart jack as an entry for another club ruff, and played heart winners to discard diamond losers from the dummy. West would ruff the fourth heart, but the dummy would score two more tricks to give South nine.   De Falco did better by taking the spade ace, cashing two diamond winners to make sure of them, and leading the spade jack. Soloway won with the king, led to the queen and played a fourth round, going down one.   Looking at all four hands, there is a difficult way to succeed in three spades after De Falco's defense. South must assume an even heart break, and start by winning the fourth trick in dummy with the spade queen. He must then enter his hand with a heart lead and ruff a diamond, establishing a diamond winner. Then he can overtake the heart jack and continue hearts. East must ruff sooner or later, and the closed hand has a trump entry, allowing any remaining red-suit winners to be played. East has two trump tricks and two diamond winners but that is all.   So the double-dummy answer is that you should choose to play three spades. But you should not choose to bid it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940108","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/08/nyregion/news-summary-807397.html","abstract":"  International -6  NATO OFFERS POLAND A DEAL  The United States told Poland that NATO was willing to hold joint military exercises on its territory this year.

Its immediate predecessor was \"I Lombardi\" by Verdi, an opera that makes no sense at all but somehow persuades us that it does.   Dvorak's \"Rusalka\" offered an altogether prettier face before Christmas and with it enough dramatic logic and beautiful music to constitute a thriving masterpiece. Yet few companies outside Central Europe put it on with any frequency. It doesn't take much digging to see what's wrong with \"I Lombardi,\" namely a plot in which A leads not to B but instead leaps without explanation to the farthest reaches of the alphabet.

That is a relief to Israel, which would be within range of such a missile.    True, North Korea has not yet agreed to admit inspectors to two suspected but undeclared nuclear sites. But this initial agreement, if carried out, will go a long way toward easing immediate fears about the North's nuclear program.

Like the United States, Germany faces a conflict between the pressures of increased global competition and the demands of a citizenry unwilling to leave health and social welfare entirely to the market. This conflict has a special impact on women, and reveals a weakness of the grand free-market future so many Germans envisioned.\n\nBefore the wall fell, East Germany provided extensive public support for parents, especially working mothers. Child care was highly subsidized and widely available. Guaranteed maternity leave amounted to a year off at an average of 80 percent of full pay. The state enforced child support responsibilities by garnishing wages, and provided insurance to fill the gap if an absent parent failed to pay.

Ms. Shire begat Gordon Hamersley, her former sous-chef who has just opened the splendid new Hamersley's Bistro in the South End.

But those days are over. Various operators of the theater have failed, and its latest incarnation as the Club Carousel has also folded. Its operator, Michael J. Sullo of Milford, is the target of investigations by several state agencies. A Night to Forget     By all accounts, the theater reached its low point on New Year's Eve. Joyce and Daniel O'Neill of Shelton came that night, looking forward to dinner, dancing and a show.    But for the first two hours, all they got for their $165 was salad, rolls and a television set rolled onto the stage for entertainment. There were only 30 people in the audience.    \"The whole atmosphere was strange and unprofessional and it became apparent we weren't going to get what we paid for,\" Mrs. O'Neill said. \"Our night was completely ruined.\"    After being denied a refund, they complained to the police and the Better Business Bureau.    The theater's landlord has taken Mr. Sullo to court, seeking more than $150,000 in back rent. On Wednesday Mr. Sullo, who also worked as an insurance agent and investment broker, was arrested on charges of writing bad checks and bilking a client out of more than $40,000. On Friday the State Banking Commission accused him of defrauding his brokerage customers. When some of those customers asked for their money, the commission said, Mr. Sullo told them he had diverted it to run the theater.    The failure of the theater has upset many in Fairfield County. It opened in 1977, and despite ups and downs, remained in business until 1992. Last September it reopened as Club Carousel. 'A Real Tragedy'     \"There was an abundance of excellent theater there over the years, and it's a real tragedy what's happened,\" said Douglas Bora, a local actor who appeared in Club Carousel's only major show, \"South Pacific.\"    \"I did my first show as a child actor in 1928 and in all these years I never saw anything like the monstrosity that the theater became in its closing weeks,\" Mr. Bora said. \"We need a dinner theater there, and I just hope that somebody will come along and open it up again and return it to its previous high quality.\"    Mollie Klaff Passero, a former actress who appeared in one of the theater's earliest shows, said, \"It was a marvelous place to see a musical -- it was practically like being on Broadway\"    Ms. Passero, the owner of Klaff's Lighting and Decorative Hardware Stores in Norwalk and Westport, said, \"The theater's closing has left a major void.\"    Despite his legal and financial problems, Mr. Sullo denied any wrongdoing. \"The Carousel closed because it just didn't do well and that's all there is to it,\" he said. \"I'm not going to make any other comment about all of these allegations other than to say that in the end I will be completely vindicated. I don't owe anybody anything.\" Bait and Switch     But former Club Carousel employees, who have filed complaints with the State Labor Department to recover more than $60,000 in back pay, say Mr. Sullo mismanaged the theater and often lied to customers.    \"It was a bait-and-switch scam where we would put on a good show like 'South Pacific,' but then the next week we would put on a rinky-dink show and charge the same admission price,\" said Edward C. Moffat of Stamford, who said he was hired last summer as a bodyguard for the actors but ended up working as an unofficial manager.    Mr. Moffat said the Club Carousel's first show, \"South Pacific,\" starring Jamie Farr, closed a week early in November because the theater lacked the money to pay the actors. At Mr. Moffat's suggestion, the theater said the show was closing because Mr. Farr had to return to California because of the brush fires there.    \"I didn't think a few white lies to the public would hurt,\" Mr. Moffat said.  \"But it got out of control. If I knew how far all of this would go, I never would have been involved.\" 'Very Disturbing'    Zalina Hoosein, senior business representative for Actors Equity, and Robert Malcolm, Mr. Farr's agent, said they were upset when the theater's owners blamed Mr. Farr for the show's closing. \"It was very disturbing to read all of that because there was only one reason the show closed early, and that was because there were insufficient funds to pay the actors,\" Ms. Hoosein said.    Robert Rising of Trumbull, who had bought eight tickets totaling $466 for the final Friday performance of \"South Pacific\" -- which was canceled -- said he was unable to get his money back.    When he went to the club, he was told by a man who called himself John D'Agostino -- whom he said he later learned was Mr. Sullo -- that he would have to take the matter up with the owner.    \"He told me that Jamie Farr had some other obligations and that there was nothing he could do to refund my tickets,\" Mr. Rising said. \"The whole thing sounded very strange and I knew something was terribly wrong.\"    Corbin Associates, the landlord, hopes the theater will reopen someday, but the company said it may have to consider other uses for the site.   The northeast corner of Central Park will soon have an entrance that will rival the ones in the fancy neighborhoods at the south corners.    Work will begin this month on a project to transform the corner, Frawley Circle, from a dusty traffic snarl to a true circle filled with trees and a fitting home for a grand statue dedicated to one of the legends of Harlem, Duke Ellington.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Persistent Sexism in American Education; Why So Few Women Physicists?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/education/persistent-sexism-in-american-education-why-so-few-women-physicists.html","abstract":"  COLUMBIA University is unusual because it has one woman on the faculty in its physics department.

Messier took the ice against the Montreal Canadiens tonight at the Forum, stole a puck early in the first period, and set up a Rangers goal on New York's first shot of the game. It was pretty, it was effective, and it was just what the Rangers needed after a stretch of frustrating offensive performances.   It just wasn't enough. Despite Messier's return from a wrist injury that sidelined him six games, the Rangers lost, 3-2, to the Canadiens, who happen to be the defending Stanley Cup champions but also happen to be in third place in the Northeast Division right now. The defeat, coupled with New York's 4-1 loss to Calgary on Wednesday, marked the Rangers' first back-to-back losses since they fell to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Tampa Bay Lightning in the third week of October. It was also the Rangers' third loss in their past four games.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Bid to Revise Education Is Fought in Connecticut","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/nyregion/bid-to-revise-education-is-fought-in-connecticut.html","abstract":"  A movement to improve the public schools that has gained a rare consensus among Presidents, governors, business leaders and educators is coming under attack in Connecticut, as it has across the country.

Because they are dormant, this is a good time of year to think about having them pruned, cabled or braced and checked. Or if they are property liabilities, they may even have to be cut down, a sad case. But this drastic step is necessary particularly if the tree is diseased in its core and has rotted.   There are two basic reasons why trees are trimmed when they are dormant. The most obvious one, of course, is that the deciduous trees are leafless and it is easy for the arborists to see what branches need to be cut out. Getting to the twigs and limbs is simplified. The other reason is that the trees will not bleed. That is the sap is not running inside the tree's core. When the sap is flowing up the trunk, it will ooze from any cuts and run down the trunk making an unsightly mess. Though this bleeding does not harm the tree, the appearance often worries homeowners and quite often insects are attracted to the sap causing a secondary problem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Collapsing Into Himself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/books/collapsing-into-himself.html","abstract":"  WILD CAT FALLING By Mudrooroo.

Miss Wormwood is a proponent of the Mortimer J. Adler Paedia Proposal, that Great Books about great ideas and deeds should be introduced in the elementary grades (Adler, 1985); cf. Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\"--\"Book learning is most of what a teacher can give.\" (Bloom, 1987). This is the if-you-build-the-schoolhouse-the-pupils-will-come-and-worship-gods-of-learning school of education.*  2. Calvin may be an example Howard Gardener refers to as Multiple Intelligences (Gardner, 1993). though Gardener refuses to admit it. Here Calvin clearly exhibits strengths in linguistic, scientific and outerspatial intelligence.**  3. You can see from Calvin's obvious level of emotional and intellectual commitment to comic books that reading them puts him in a state of what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines as flow: \"When challeges are high and personal skills are used to the utmost, we experience that rare state of consciousness . . . . We feel involved, concentrated, absorbed.\" (Csikszentmihalyi, 1993).***  4. Miss Wormwood is a devoted disciplinary disciple of either William or Jesse James. **** Her oppoents argue displeased with Calvin's ahistoricity. However, Calvin could counter that many famous and successful people had little regard for history, viz. Henry Ford, \"History is more or less bunk\", and cf. Ronald Reagan, \"Facts are stupid things\" et passim.    5. Miss Wormwood takes the neoconservative approach along with Adler, Bloom, E.D. Hirtsch and William Bennett, who hunger for a capacious store of common knowledge and skills.*****    6. Gardner is insistent that Calvin's strong domains of intelligence not be labeled \"dumb\" and \"useless\" by an uncaring educational system that has only \"impatience with approaches that cherish the individuality of each student.\" (ibid) Bloom, however, knows Calvin is dumb and useless. Sociologist Paul Fussell adds that what Calvin knows is not only dumb and useless but bad. (Fussell, 1991).  7. Fussell reports there are 60 million functionally illiterate adults in the United States, with another 60 million reading at a fifth grade level. Only 6 percent of the population report having read at least one book in the last year. (ibid)  8. Calvin did read at least one bona fide book last year, in addition to \"Captain Thermonuclear etc.\" It was Robert Fulghum's \"Everything I Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.\" At least he started it.+   9. Calvin can only agree with Gardner that \"a significant part of our educational malaise lay in the mindless instruments that were conventionally used to assess student learning\" (Gardner, op cit) and with John Dewey that \"In contrast to the 'testing society' I think that the assessment approach and the individual-centered school constitute a more noble educational vision. Both are more inkeeping with American democratic and pluralistic values (Dewey, 1938). \"Relativism!\" scoffs Bloom. BAD, says Fussell.  *Hah! Wrong! Even if you build it, they will still sit around reading comic books. (Hobbes)  ** Note: there is no entry for \"Captain Napalm's Thermonuclear League of Liberty\" in E.D. Hirsch's \"A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What Our Children Need to Know\" (Hirsch, 1989).  ***But what is the poor lad getting excited about? Trash like Captain Thermonuclear? Doesn't he know that in Hobbes' words, life is \"mean, nasty, brutish and short\"? (Hobbes, 19TK).+  ****This was still being debated when Education Life went to press.  7:  [  NO! NO! You journalists are all the same. What I actually told the Republican National Convention in 1988, quoting from John Addams, of course was this:   \"Facts are stupid things, stubborn things, I should say.\" -- Ronald Reagan. Incidentally, if you tip either this footnote symbol or your head on its side, you'll see it makes a very nice, small portrait of me.   *****That capacious-store business is actually a clever bit of plagarism on Nash's part but we heard somewhere that, if you confess that kind of thin it in a footnote to a footnote, you're all right.

Among studio lights, scrims and screens, his subjects were revealed in their incomparable, irreplaceable beauty. His new volume, ANIMA (Arts Alternative Press, 3200 Valmont Avenue, Suite 7, Boulder, Colo. 80301; $29.95), continues to disrupt the cavalier perception of nature by focusing on Homo sapiens. In 28 dramatic photographs, Mr. Balog portrays his figures as if they were fossils obscured by the darkness of history. His photographs are of individuals -- human and chimpanzee -- encountering one another with no context but light and space. His photographs capture the radiance of pure expression in Isabella Rossellini's face and in the chimp who cradles it. The accompanying text, similarly denuded of metaphor, is itself what the photographer calls a \"psychological labyrinth,\" an accretion of typography and meditation on our animal nature and our unnatural dissociation from it. The resulting elegantly designed book is an unsettling record of an artist exposing us, with neither shame nor embarrassment, for the animals we are.\nMICHAEL J.

Men are defective: brutal, competitive, exploitative, insensitive, disconnected from meaningful social relationships, out of touch with their feelings and oblivious to things they do not want to hear. It is impossible to get them to do housework, even when they are unemployed. Why not simply replace the unit? They just lie around and make noise. Feeding them is an act of charity.

A few have even made New Year's resolutions to reinvent themselves into new males. A crisis literature on male identity has burst onto the scene, featuring titles like \"The End of Manhood,\" \"Myths of Masculinity,\" \"Not Guilty\" and \"Why Men Hate Women.\" Men, largely white, middle-class, middle-aged men, M.D.'s and Ph.D.'s, storytellers and drumbeaters, camp counselors and boys' school teachers, members of \"Hairy-Chested Men's Groups\" and former gang members, fire walkers and holistic healers are writing earnest, heartfelt, even sentimental books about what it means to be a man, with all sorts of heroic recommendations about how to become one.

Not only does it add variety, stimulation and beauty, but it expresses how we feel. To see color, we need light, which reflects different colors on different wavelengths. Most objects appear to have color because their chemical structures absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. Physics aside, we also think in terms of colors: We \"see red,\" we're \"green with envy,\" or we feel \"purple passion.\" And \"once in a blue moon\" we can ace a quiz. So give it a try; who knows, your prospects may be rosy. By Fran Handman     1. The colors that appear in a rainbow are called the color spectrum. What are its colors that are visible to the human eye?     2. Part of the spectrum is invisible, comprising rays of various wavelengths. What are their names and why are they invisible?     3. Which color in the visible spectrum has the shortest wavelength? The longest?     4. A colorant is any substance that imparts color to a given product like ink, paint, crayons or chalk. When is a colorant a dye and when is it a pigment?    5. Define and name the primary colors.     6. What colors of light are blended to make white light?     7. What colors in paints are mixed to make black?     8. All but one of the following colors -- cerulean, azure, amber, cobalt, cornflower -- are similar; which is the exception, and why?    9. Match the following terms with their correct definitions: (a) tone, (b) shade, (c) tint; (x)mixing gray with a color, (y) mixing white with a color, (z)mixing black with a color.    10. A monochromatic color scheme is a) one color; b) shades of gray or brown; c) shades, tones and tints of a single color.    11. Match the following terms with their definitions: (a) hue, (b) value, (c) chroma; (x) The amount of light reflected from a colored object; (y) measurement of saturation of a color; (z) a particular shade or tint of a given color.    12. At what age can infants first see colors: 2 months; 3 months; 6 months?    13. Why can't humans see color in dim light?    14. The most common type of color-blindness is the inability to see (a)any color; (b) red and green; (c) yellow and blue.    15. Only men may be color-blind: true or false?    16.

Its comparatively recent, 17th-century origins deny this metropolitan city the ruins and tombs of New Delhi, or New Delhi's sense of having been privy to decisive moments in India's past. It lacks the fast-paced cosmopolitanism of Bombay, nor can it parallel Calcutta's down-at-the-heels charm, its bequest of colonial-era stateliness, and its intellectual and political vitality. Tamil Nadu's capital offers no quota of palaces, not much by way of decaying princely pomp. On the face of it, Madras appears to be just another large, bustling Indian city, densely populated and beset with challenges. Yet a thoughtful visitor can push beneath the surface reality to discover fascinating and unsuspected facets of city life. Madras, too, has admirers alive to its subtle and varied charms.\n\nMadras connoisseurs tend to synchronize their visits with the short southern winter in December and January, to avoid the sultry summer climate.

MacArthur. University of California, $10. Determined not to repeat the mistakes of the Vietnam era, the United States Government adopted a policy of control and containment of information during the 1991 war with Iraq. \"Mr. MacArthur writes in fury at what he sees, correctly, as the press's failure to respond effectively,\" Michael Janeway said here in 1992.  RIPLEY UNDER WATER By Patricia Highsmith. Black Lizard/Vintage Crime, $10. Tom Ripley is an intelligent, cultured gentleman who dabbles in art, music and, occasionally, murder. A popular though unlikely hero, he has appeared in several of Patricia Highsmith's books without ever getting caught. But in this one, Ripley's new neighbors seem to know a great deal about the skeletons in his closet, needling him not for extortion but for pleasure. In 1992 our reviewer, Julian Symons, said of Ms. Highsmith, \"One closes most of her books -- and her equally powerful and chilling short stories -- with a feeling that the world is more dangerous than one had imagined.\" For readers unacquainted with Ripley, this publisher has also reissued THE BOY WHO FOLLOWED RIPLEY ($10), a 1980 novel in which he becomes the protector of a runaway teen-ager, and RIPLEY'S GAME ($10), published in 1974, in which he manipulates someone into committing murder.  ORIGINS RECONSIDERED: In Search of What Makes Us Human By Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. Did the human species evolve simultaneously in Africa, Asia and Europe? Did morality originate with the emergence of human beings or can it be traced farther back? These are among the questions discussed by Richard Leakey, the paleoanthropologist. \"It is not often that a major participant in so contentious a field delivers such a vivid, generally evenhanded summation,\" John Noble Wilford said here in 1992.  I, TITUBA, BLACK WITCH OF SALEM By Maryse Conde. Translated by Richard Philcox. One World/Ballantine, $10. The author, a native of Guadeloupe, has created a rich novel from the history of another West Indian woman, the real Tituba, who played a central role in the Salem witch trials. In 1992 our reviewer, Howard Frank Mosher, praised Ms. Conde's \"gift for storytelling and her unswerving focus on her characters.\" Ballantine has also reissued JUMPING SHIP: And Other Stories, by Kelvin Christopher James ($10). Born in Trinidad, Mr. James focuses on the intersection of American and Caribbean cultures in the present day. He evokes \"a particular world by virtue of his energy and generosity of spirit,\" Tom Piazza said here in 1992.  DAYS OF OBLIGATION: An Argument With My Mexican Father By Richard Rodriguez. Penguin, $11. The author, who grew up in the United States, discovers that Mexico, the land of his parents, holds more meaning for him than he would ever have believed. Other assumptions about being Roman Catholic and gay are also examined in these autobiographical essays. In 1992 our reviewer, David L. Kirp, said, \"The self remains Mr. Rodriguez's best and truest subject.\"  BLACK DOGS By Ian McEwan. Bantam, $7.95. In this novel-cum-parable, the disintegration of a marriage is related by the couple's son-in-law, Jeremy. In writing his memoir, he keeps returning to a mystical encounter between June (his mother-in-law) and a pair of fierce black dogs. In 1992 our reviewer, Bette Pesetsky, praised \"the richly designed weaving of a truly sinister and very real postwar Europe into these lives.\"  ANATOMY OF LOVE: The Mysteries of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray By Helen Fisher. Fawcett Columbine, $12.50. The complexities of courtship are reduced to biological imperatives in this social and sexual analysis. For instance, couples are most likely to divorce after four years because they've had enough time to raise a child past infancy and can then feel free to vary the gene pool. Mary Batten, the author of SEXUAL STRATEGIES: How Females Choose Their Mates (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $12.95), also sees parenting responsibilities as central. Women are more selective about mating, she explains, because they will largely deal with the consequences. Both books \"are fun and sometimes even delightful to read,\" Natalie Angier said here in 1992.  DUNSTER By John Mortimer. Penguin, $10.95. A British accountant in the midst of a boring middle age has one element in his life that is all too interesting: the constant reappearances of an obnoxious schoolmate, Dick Dunster, who remains his nemesis. Last year our reviewer, Jane Smiley, called the novel \"a delicious read, like a meal you expect to enjoy, and do.\"  MATISSE, PICASSO, MIRO AS I KNEW THEM By Rosamond Bernier. Knopf, $35. The author, who co-founded the French art magazine L'Oeil, drew upon her many years in Paris for the reminiscences and interviews that fueled her popular lectures, transmuted here into essays. \"They already have a period charm, evoking a smaller, simpler and probably more agreeable art world,\" Michael Peppiatt said here in 1991. Painting on the other side of the Atlantic is the subject of AMERICAN VIEWS: Essays on American Art, by John Wilmerding (Princeton University, $35), in which the author discusses the work of artists like Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Fitz Hugh Lane and William Bradford. In 1991 our reviewer, John Russell, said, \"On his home ground, Mr. Wilmerding never flags.\"  LAUREL GRAEBER","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Rockefeller Estate: January Bookings for May","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/travel/travel-advisory-rockefeller-estate-january-bookings-for-may.html","abstract":"  Reservations for tours of the Rockefeller estate in the Hudson Valley, to open to the public starting May 4, will be taken beginning Jan. 17.

Such an alliance would commit the U.S. to their defense. But as Bosnia showed, neither the U.S. nor its allies seem eager to assume such commitments.   Moreover, the military threat that frightens Eastern Europe is, at worst, years away. One way to keep that threat from ever becoming a reality is to begin treating both Russia and the Eastern Europeans as partners -- cultivating habits of military cooperation throughout the region.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"The Mugger Who Came Back From the Dead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/books/the-mugger-who-came-back-from-the-dead.html","abstract":"  THE GREEN KNIGHT By Iris Murdoch. 472 pp. New York: Viking. $23.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Neediest Cases Restores Girl's Will to Help Herself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/nyregion/neediest-cases-restores-girl-s-will-to-help-herself.html","abstract":"  Before last October, most of Stephanie Vega's weekdays began with an early-morning promise to her grandmother that she would attend school.

But recent gains in revenue from taxes on sales and financial services will be eaten up in the rising cost of services, tax officials say. Increased revenue prompted Governor Cuomo to propose cutting or eliminating some business taxes, but the state will still face a $1.5 billion budget shortfall for its fiscal 1995, beginning April 1. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Christine Whitman has promised a dramatic cut in income taxes. While the state's revenues rose 3 percent this fiscal year and another moderate increase is forecast for fiscal 1995, Mrs. Whitman will have to deal with a budget gap of at least $800 million.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Giuliani Exhorts Reno To Call a Crown Hts.

The drama and dignity of the Phrygian cadence, the wildly expressive melisma of Moorish origin, the delicate sensuousness of the guitar: all create pressure on composers to keep these assets intact. Perhaps one reason German music, to take one example, has been explored more widely and deeply than Spain's is that its folk materials are relatively uninteresting and therefore lend themselves to easy manipulation.   Saturday evening's concert by Sharon Isbin and Benita Valente at the Metropolitan Museum offered guitar solos and songs with guitar accompaniment.

Men and women over the age of 50 seem to think they will not be infected with the disease, researchers said, even though 10 percent of AIDS cases, including those of gay men, are diagnosed each year in that age group. The highest rate of heterosexual transmission of AIDS occurs in people over 50, they said.    The survey was conducted by Dr. Ron Stall and Dr. Joe Catania of the University of California in San Francisco and is described today in the Archives of Internal Medicine.   Younger people seem to be getting the message about ways to protect themselves against AIDS, Dr. Stall said. But for older people there has been no public health warning. \"When have you ever seen an AIDS poster with a wrinkled face?\" he said. Focus on Specific Risks    To find out what older Americans are doing to protect themselves against AIDS, the researchers culled 3,188 interviews with people over the age of 50 from large national surveys on the disease. \"We focused on heterosexuals and looked for specific risk factors,\" Dr. Stall said.   Ten percent of the men and women said they had had multiple sexual partners or a blood transfusion in the 1980's before AIDS screening was widely available, Dr. Stall said. Despite these risk factors, he said, older people were six times less likely to use condoms and five times less likely to have tests for AIDS than people in their 20's with similar risk factors.    \"We heard a lot of people say 'Thank God, this wasn't around in my day,' \" Dr. Stall said. \"But it is around in their day. It's such a horrible epidemic. It's easy to deny your own risk.\"   Doctors tend to ignore AIDS risk factors in their older patients, said Dr. Mitchell Feldman, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. \"They assume older people don't have sex and are not at risk,\" he said. \"But not only are they having sex, they are not taking precautions.\"   People over the age of 50 have consistently accounted for 10 percent of AIDS cases since the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began keeping track of the numbers. More than 33,000 people over 50 are now infected with AIDS.   Education programs about H.I.V. for older Americans are badly needed, Dr. Feldman said.  They would reduce the risk in that age group, he said, and \"trickle down\" to younger Americans who may take their own risk of contracting AIDS more seriously if they see their parents taking protective measures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Mideast Talks: What Happened?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/mideast-talks-what-happened.html","abstract":"  The lengthening delays in the Middle East peace talks are disheartening to Israelis, Palestinians and others around the world whose hopes soared with the announcement of the historic September framework peace agreement.
