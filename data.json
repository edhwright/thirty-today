By Thomas Petzinger Jr. Illustrated. 520 pp. New York: Times Business Books/Random House. $30.    AS the invective grew louder between labor and management at Eastern Airlines in 1983, Frank Borman heard a frightening rumor.

This is far too hyperbolic a statement. Ms. Doerr does have a  sure and elegant hand when it comes to describing flora and fauna and the houses in California and Mexico where she has lived. But with her keen attention to detail in matters of character and emotion, she demonstrates a compassionate spirit that is anything but evil. Using an episodic structure similar to those in her novels, \"Stones From Ibarra\" and \"Consider This, Senora,\" this new book allows Ms. Doerr to contemplate certain events from the nearly nine decades of her life, even as she returns us to the locales made familiar in her fiction. Writing with admirable simplicity, she recalls spending sublime childhood summers at the beach, knitting a muffler for an American soldier in France (who  sent her a much-cherished thank-you note) and going off to Smith College in 1927. There are also memories of being widowed at 65 after 42 years of marriage  and then going back to college, and of helplessly standing by as her son began to succumb to cancer. Several of the short stories, set in Ibarra, reacquaint readers with Sara and Richard Everton, who were introduced in Ms. Doerr's first  book. Others explore different parts of rural Mexico. Like the matilija poppies  of Ms. Doerr's youth, \"whose crushed tissue-paper petals unfolded every June into white flowers as big as a child's face,\" these previously uncollected short works are strikingly pure and radiant.

teacher. All her life she had  heard the adage, \"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.\" So Ms. Elliott pursued, albeit miserably, a career as a psychologist. Then in 1994, while completing her master's in psychology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,  she spotted a flier offering paid teaching internships for minority students. \n\n      That's how Ms. Elliott's career took a detour and why, on a Friday afternoon, she was trasforming a second grade classroom at the private Park School of Baltimore into a bazaar of Hispanic culture. Hispanic art and storybooks were diplayed along with magazines featuring Hispanic productsandmodels. Students tasted mango nectar and galleta cookies (similar to  shortbread), popular in Puerto Rico, where Ms. Elliott grew up.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Education"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"TELEVISION VIEW;Sure, We're All Just One Big Happy Family","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/arts/television-view-sure-we-re-all-just-one-big-happy-family.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"A Modest Muse Interprets Friel Once More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/theater/a-modest-muse-interprets-friel-once-more.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Classical Briefs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/arts/classical-briefs-048950.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"THE WORLD;Europeans Redefine What Makes a Citizen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/weekinreview/the-world-europeans-redefine-what-makes-a-citizen.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Week in Review"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;Feed the Meter; See It Light Up (But Still Expire)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-up-close-feed-meter-see-it-light-up-but-still.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/c-corrections-052175.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"HOCKEY;Richter, Messier, Lidster . . . the Rangers Toll Mounts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/hockey-richter-messier-lidster-the-rangers-toll-mounts.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Western Steaks With Flavors of the East","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/western-steaks-with-flavors-of-the-east.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"To List of Risky Bikers Add Food Carriers on Sidewalk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/l-to-list-of-risky-bikers-add-food-carriers-on-sidewalk-052191.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: TRIBECA;Just One Stop for All Your Viewing, Dining and Listening","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-tribeca-just-one-stop-for-all-your-viewing-dining-listening.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;Jungle on Eighth St.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-up-close-jungle-on-eighth-st.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Lisa A.

This prospect in no way reduces the pain of those AT&T; employees who must now seek new careers -- 40,000 in all, including those who accepted voluntary buyouts and employees in subsidiaries.

King would later write that his unanticipated call to leadership \"happened so quickly that I did not have time to think it through. It is probable that if I had, I would have declined the nomination.\" \n\n     Although press reports at the time focused on his inspiring oratory, King was actually a reluctant leader of a movement initiated by others. (The boycott began on Dec. 5, 1955.) His subsequent writings and private correspondence reveal a man whose inner doubts sharply contrast with his public persona. In the early days of his involvement, King was troubled by telephone threats, discord within the black community and Montgomery's \"get tough\" policy, to which King attributed his jailing on a minor traffic violation. One night, as he considered ways to \"move out of the picture without appearing a coward,\" he began to pray aloud and, at that moment, \"experienced the presence of the Divine as I had never experienced Him before.\"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"BLACKBOARD;Surprisingly Sunny, for Senoirs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/education/blackboard-surprisingly-sunny-for-senoirs.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Education"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Sarah Bernstein, James Jones 3d","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/style/sarah-bernstein-james-jones-3d.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"SPORTS PEOPLE: HORSE RACING;Jockey Honored for 4-in-a-Row 400 Club","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/sports-people-horse-racing-jockey-honored-for-4-in-a-row-400-club.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"ALSO INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/also-inside-050113.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"THE PASSION OF SUK KYI","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/magazine/the-passion-of-suk-kyi.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GREEWICH VILLAGE;Traffic Mousetrap Foils City and Pedestrians","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-greewich-village-traffic-mousetrap-foils-city-pedestrians.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"SPORTS PEOPLE: HORSE RACING;Jockey Honored for 4-in-a-Row 400 Club","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/sports-people-horse-racing-jockey-honored-for-4-in-a-row-400-club.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Sarah Bernstein, James Jones 3d","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/style/sarah-bernstein-james-jones-3d.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Painting With Words","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/painting-with-words.html","abstract":"DIDEROT ON ART Edited and translated by John Goodman.

LEON WHITESON'S book belongs to a genus that is coming back into fashion after a dormant spell: the miniature memoir, almost an extended essay, partial but intense, more rumination than narrative. It is not unusual for a book of this type to have a presiding metaphor or resonating motif. The writer tours himself, and takes the reader with him, while ostensibly looking out from that self onto its preoccupations. \"In Patagonia,\" by Bruce Chatwin, is a model of the type, fabulously self-absorbed but exhilaratingly inclusive.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"The Original Mogul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/the-original-mogul.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"LET THEM EAT CAKE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/magazine/l-let-them-eat-cake-048887.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"To Unlock Economic Power, Cut the Capital Gains Tax","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/l-to-unlock-economic-power-cut-the-capital-gains-tax-050806.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"The Good Servant","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/the-good-servant.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Child Abuse System Faulted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/child-abuse-system-faulted.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE;In Stuyvesant Town, Customers Can't Bank On Tellers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-side-in-stuyvesant-town-customers-can-t-bank-on-tellers.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Fighting Over Djuna","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/l-fighting-over-djuna-049778.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"An Icebreaker Through The Antarctic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/travel/an-icebreaker-through-the-antarctic.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Children Brighten Adults' Day Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/children-brighten-adults-day-care.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Sports of The Times;Steeler Stewart Runs With Spirit of Thorpe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/sports-of-the-times-steeler-stewart-runs-with-spirit-of-thorpe.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"PRO FOOTBALL;Kansas City and Indianapolis Bring Similar Game Plans to Their Playoff Matchup","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/pro-football-kansas-city-indianapolis-bring-similar-game-plans-their-playoff.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL;St. John's Bad Season Is Only Getting Worse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/college-basketball-st-john-s-bad-season-is-only-getting-worse.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"LONG ISLAND JOURNAL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/long-island-journal-049670.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"VOICES: VIEWPOINT;Look, Uncle Sam, No Form 1040's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/voices-viewpointlook-uncle-sam-no-form-1040s.html","abstract":"THE worst part about the American income tax system is filling out long and complex tax forms -- the sort millions of Americans began receiving from the Internal Revenue Service last week. The I.R.S. already has most of the information we have to enter on numerous forms and schedules. If the United States followed the lead of Britain and many other European countries, most of us could avoid this annual burden. At the same time, the Government would pick up more revenue at less expense. \n\n     How? Through a return-free tax system based on withholding at the source with lower rates. With a few systemic adjustments, the United States could have a less burdensome income tax system that would be simpler and fairer to most taxpayers.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL;UConn Ends Tennessee's Reign at Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/college-basketball-uconn-ends-tennessee-s-reign-at-home.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"RECORDINGS VIEW;Dvorak Does Disney?
