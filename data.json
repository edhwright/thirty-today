When Mr. Safer spoke about \"worthless junk\" and \"the trash heap of art history\" and, standing in front of a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, asked a group of teen-agers the familiar question -- couldn't they do better than that? -- I thought of one of the Armory Show's more vituperative critics. He called it \"stupefying in its vulgarity\" and singled out Matisse for creating \"patterns unworthy of the mere ignorance of little children and benighted savages . . . patterns insanely, repulsively depraved.\"   The Armory Show critic was, of course, Duncan Phillips, who in the years just after that exhibition became one of the most serious converts to modernism and one of the most perspicacious collectors of Matisse; in 1921 he founded the first museum in the United States dedicated to modern art, in Washington.

But Kristen, when she isn't in school, voice or dance class, pursues solutions to several societal problems with an industry not often seen in someone her age.\nBegan With Local Food Bank\n\n It started, she explained, when as a student at Mitchell Elementary School in Woodbury, she proposed a fund-raising event to save rain forests. It turned into a fund drive for the local food bank, which she chaired with a friend, Marcy Szablewicz. The two girls filled the Woodbury food bank and raised $710 for the Waterbury Soup Kitchen during the winter of 1992. Then they turned their attention to a winter clothing drive. When she appeared on a local radio station, WPKN, to ask for used clothes, a member of the organization called EARTH (Education and Resources to Help) contacted her to discuss working for the Indians of South Dakota.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"Klein's 4 Touchdown Passes Power C.

Now you need a little help. Here are some tips on how to get your dog immunized and how often, what sort of food it should be eating, where it can get a Swedish massage, and more. FOOD \"One of the major nutritional issues with dogs in New York City is comparable to that of people,\" Dr. Brodsky said. \"They eat too well and exercise too little. People tend to manifest their love and bond with their dogs by feeding them too much.\"   He recommends feeding a plump dog smaller servings of standard nutritional food and giving an under-exercised dog a higher-fiber variety. Most food companies now make \"less active\" or \"light diet\" selections.   Eating garbage off the streets is unhealthy and should be discouraged. If your dog does not respond to scolding, you may want to take it to the vet to make sure it isn't scavenging because of a nutritional deficiency. LICENSING  Licenses -- and the tags that come with them -- are required for all dogs in New York City, though the A.S.P.C.A. says that only about 140,000 of the city's two million to three million dogs are actually licensed.    The license costs $8.50, as does its yearly renewal, which the owner can get by calling the City Health Department, (212) 566-2456, and asking for an application. The fine for failing to license is $1,000; Sanitation Department workers are authorized to give summonses, although, truth told, they rarely do. LEASHNG  New York City law dictates that all dogs must be leashed when outdoors and that owners must clean up after their dogs, in the name of street cleanliness. There is a $250 fine for violating either the leash law or the poop-scooper law, and any Sanitation, Health Department, Parks and Recreation employee or city police officer is authorized to give a $250 summons for a violation.    But the laws are rarely enforced; about 250 poop-scooper summonses are issued each year. If you see someone failing to pick up after his or her dog, shame is the best revenge. SPAYING AND NEUTERING  The A.S.P.C.A. recommends spaying and neutering to keep the number of strays down. The A.S.P.C.A. will neuter male dogs for $55 and spay females for $65; the fee increases, proportionally, for dogs over 50 pounds. OBEDIENCE  If an owner expects to keep his shoulders intact, his or her dog must be taught quickly to walk properly, to obey the \"heel!\" command and to sit at corners, says Bob DeFranco, director of the Canines of America School of Dog Training in Rego Park, Queens.   Mr. DeFranco also receives a lot of calls from owners whose dogs pick fights with other dogs in the park. This too should be dealt with quickly in obedience training, at an early age.   \"All a dog hears when its owner talks is 'blah, blah, blah,' \" he said. \"We have to teach people early on to communicate with their dog so he understands that he is not leader of the pack.\" SHOTS  Rabies shots are mandatory in New York State; they cost $10 at the A.S.P.C.A. and about $45 at a veterinarian. Do it two years in a row and you are home free for the next three years. In addition, puppies should get distemper, hepatitis and parainfluenza shots every four weeks until they are 22 weeks old; older dogs should get yearly boosters. Kennel cough shots are recommended for dogs that spend a lot of time in kennels.   Dr. Stuart Brodsky, a veterinarian at the West Side Veterinary Center on West 83d Street, recommends that dog owners who spend weekends in the country consider Lyme disease vaccines. BARKING  \"Dogs bark because of separation anxiety,\" Mr. DeFranco said. \"The dog says: 'Oh my God, my owners are gone, I need to chew something, I need to bark.' \" To break your dog of this habit before your neighbor down the hall breaks its neck, Mr. DeFranco suggests rewards when it follows commands. This helps to build the dog's self-confidence and makes it less anxious when you are away.   Another trick: \"Bye-bye bones,\" a rawhide variety that is hollowed out and filled with food treats that take the dog a long time to dig out. Or try toys stuffed with socks that smell like the owner.   For chronic barkers that do not benefit from positive reinforcement or treats, there are collars that give off high-frequency sounds that encourage them to stop and collars that give mild electronic shocks.  HOUSEBREAKING  Mr. DeFranco believes that city dogs need to be trained to urinate or defecate on command -- using a code word (like \"park\") that is repeated each time the dog goes until it learns the word and does its business on command. This takes about four to six weeks. A dog should be walked at least twice a day.  STRAYS  Largely because of the danger of rabies, you should not approach a stray at all. If you must, keep your hands at your side, do not look it in the eyes, and do not make any sudden movements that will make it feel challenged.   The New York City Emergency Animal Pickup Service, (718) 649-8600, will pick up strays Monday through Friday from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. After those hours, call the local police precinct if you believe that a dog may be a health hazard. PAMPERING  The city offers a number of dog day-care centers, a resource introduced five years ago when Joseph Sporn began Yuppie Puppy on West 86th Street. For $20 a day, a dog gets to romp with a half-dozen other dogs, watch cartoons and splash in a wading pool.   Or, people like Leda Hanson, a pet nanny, will take your dog to the groomer or the vet ($38 per half-hour) or even drive it to a country house for the weekend ($95 round trip).    And then there is the Pet Department Store, where, among other things, your dog can get a Swedish massage.   Why would a dog need a massage? \"Why do people need a massage?\" said Leigh Applebrook, the owner of the store, on West 54th Street. \"If the dog has had trauma or an injury, or if it is suffering from tension, maybe fear, the massage really helps.\" A 30-minute session of Swedish, shiatsu or Tellington touch is $30. (Mrs. Applebrook recommends a series of three sessions.)   For $50, you can leave the dog for a day of fun and beauty. The dog will have a nanny at its side all day who will play with it, feed it \"nutritious food\" and bottled water, exercise it on a treadmill, walk it outside every two hours and assist it in \"interrelationship socializing.\" An example of socializing? \"Meeting a kitten for the very first time, under supervision,\" Mrs. Applebrook said. ADOPTION  The A.S.P.C.A. is the major dog-adoption agency in the city. About 90 percent of all applicants are approved, but the society does interview potential dog-owners on their ability to care for a dog. The society also tries to make good matches (couch potatoes are paired with Great Danes, for instance; joggers are offered collies or some other strong, active dog; very busy people are steered away from puppies).   The adoption fee is $55, which includes spaying or neutering, vaccinations and one follow-up exam.   Another popular adoption agency is the North Shore Animal League, Port Washington, L.I., (516) 883-7575. SUMMER . . .  Like their owners, dogs left alone in apartments need air-conditioning, particularly pug-nosed types, which have difficulty breathing in hot weather. Of course, dogs should have plenty of water at all times in extreme heat; leave several bowls around if you plan to be out all day. . . . AND WINTER  If rock salt irritates your dog's paws, wipe them with a moist cloth after each walk. Boots help, too, but putting them on four times a day can be tedious. Ditto for sweaters. ABUSE  It is a misdemeanor offense to kill, maim, injure, torture, abandon or fail to provide food for a dog. Violators can be sent to prison for a year and fined $1,000. Having dogfights for profit or amusement is a felony, punishable with four years in jail and a $25,000 fine. Anyone who sees such abuses should call the A.S.P.C.A. -- in New York, (212) 876-7700. TOYS  As a rule, big toys for big dogs, small ones for puppies. Mrs. Applebrook of the Pet Department Store recommends, for city dogs, balls that light up when they are dropped, making them easily found in dark parks; an indoor frisbee that won't \"ruin your crystal,\" and feathered toys with a turkey odor that fit over doorknobs (endlessly amusing). DEATH  If your dog dies at home, call your vet, who can help you decide whether to have it cremated or buried in a pet cemetery. It's a good idea to check with the Better Business Bureau or ask around for recommendations.   A pet's death can be as painful as that of a family member. Therapy sessions are available to help children and adults deal with grief. Call the A.S.P.C.A. or write to Hospice, 58 Pearl Street, Kingston, N.Y. 12401.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"POSTINGS: Marketing Target: Foreign Missions; A 23-Story Office Tower To Go Up Opposite the U.N.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/realestate/postings-marketing-target-foreign-missions-23-story-office-tower-go-up-opposite.html","abstract":"  Who says there's no new commercial construction in New York?

Jones recalled today. \"They were completely hysterical.\"   Under gentle questioning over the next hour or so, the two children told Detective Jones a story of living for months in isolation with two other children -- like them, in foster care -- in a cramped and often locked attic room with no furniture, no lights, no heat and little food. They pried open the bolt lock last Friday with a coat hanger and went out on their food foray because they were hungry, Detective Jones said. At the time, the couple raising them had gone out for a seafood dinner at a fast-food restaurant in Paramus, the detective said.   \"The girl told us more or less they had to go out and steal to get an adequate amount of food,\" he said. Two Others in Attic    After the questioning, Detective Jones said he went to the two-story gray house on Howland Avenue and found a 16-year-old girl sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the pitch-black attic room and a 10-year-old boy in diapers asleep on the floor.   Several hours later, the couple, Anthony James, 36, and his wife, Shirley, 39, were arrested on charges of endangering the welfare of the four children. Subsequently they were released on $10,000 bail each after a hearing in State Superior Court. The four children have been placed in the care of New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services. They were examined at Englewood Hospital and not found to be suffering from any serious physical ailments, Detective Jones said.   The other two children in the house, a foster daughter, 12, and the Jameses' son, 8, had their own bedrooms, the detective said.   The Englewood Police Department's Youth Bureau has been trying to trace the four children's lives as foster children and learn why the Jameses had them stay in the attic. Not Attending School    He also said the four children had not attended school for months.   \"They were imprisoned, more or less, in the attic,\" Detective Jones said today. They were allowed out for meals, which consisted of warm cereal in the morning, no lunch, and peanut butter sandwiches, with water, for dinner, he said. The youngsters told the detectives that they had to eat the food in the basement, not upstairs with the others. The two boys also said Mr. James hit them with belts and wires whenever they were caught taking food from the family refrigerator, the detective said.   Whenever the four had to go to the toilet, they had to knock on the locked door of the attic room to be released, the detective said. They were required to use the bathroom in the basement, not the one in the regular living quarters.   \"They were more or less rationed out toilet tissue,\" the detective said.   For the most part, he said, the two boys were allowed out of the attic, aside from meals and toilet trips, only when the Jameses' 8-year-old son wanted to play with them outdoors.   No one answered the door today at the James house. They have no telephone listing. Link to New York State    A neighbor on Howland Avenue who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the couple, like many on the quiet residential street, kept to themselves. Occasionally, he said, he saw several children in the yard, cleaning it or sharing in barbecues. He said he believed Mrs. James was a Jehovah's Witness and took the children to worship on Sundays at the kingdom hall on Palisades Avenue, about a five-minute walk from their house. Officials at the kingdom hall said today that they knew the Jameses and were aware of the charges against them. But they declined to comment further.   Authorities said they believed the five foster children had been placed with the couple by social services officials in New York and that the Jameses received monthly subsidies of $500 for each, or a total annual stipend of $30,000. Detective Jones said Mr. James was unemployed.   Authorities, he said, were also investigating whether the couple had formally adopted the five children, possibly in New Jersey.   The Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, said his staff was trying to learn why New York agencies paid the monthly maintenance stipends for the five children, but apparently did not monitor their living conditions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"Stepping into the Czardas A folk-dance tour in Budapest and Prague","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/travel/stepping-into-the-czardas-a-folk-dance-tour-in-budapest-and-prague.html","abstract":"  ONLY hours after arriving in Budapest last March, I discovered what was unique about a folk-dance tour.

Chief Justice RANDALL SHEPARD denied a request to reverse his disqualification, saying it came about because his wife had a brief conversation about the case with ALAN DERSHOWITZ, Tyson's appeals lawyer. Shepard said he would not cast a vote on whether the state's high court should hear the boxer's appeal. The court split, 2-2, last month on whether to review Tyson's 1992 conviction. It takes a majority vote to hear a case. Shepard's action denied Tyson a fair chance to have his case heard, \"particularly since there appears to be no vehicle for vouching in a fifth Justice to replace Your Honor and vote on transfer,\" Dershowitz wrote in documents made public Friday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"Honors Classes Cope With Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/nyregion/honors-classes-cope-with-reform.html","abstract":"  LIZABETH FREEMAN, a social studies teacher at Fox Lane High School here, prepares her daily lessons for two types of classes. One is a ninth-grade group of honors students, who were recommended to her course for high achievers while they were still in the eighth grade. The other is a group of 10th graders whose academic abilities are more varied.   Ms. Freeman, who has taught here for 17 years, says she hates making distinctions between the honors students and those in her mixed groups, because students labeled ordinary often shine with a special light of their own. Still, she conceded recently, when the school year was still new and the fresh faces before her held untold possibilities, \"It's very hard to avoid low expectations of less gifted kids.\" Labeling Students Losing Favor    Labeling students, or tracking them in set courses of study according to their abilities, is losing favor in the state to heterogeneous groupings more in keeping with Albany's reform plan, a New Compact for Learning. This is good, said Daniel Berman, coordinator of social studies at Fox Lane and a member of the New York State Curriculum and Assessment Council, an advisory committee appointed by the Board of Regents to help bring about the new plan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"Local Debate: Glut or Not?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-local-debate-glut-or-not.html","abstract":"  Residents of what is sometimes referred to as the Upper Upper West Side, the area above 96th Street and below Columbia University, are balking at plans for two buildings to house homeless people.

The Democrats want to win back what they say is rightfully theirs -- the unprecedented victory they saw at the polls the last time around.   In 1991, Republicans surrendered their stronghold on the Board for the first time in 83 years -- although they regained it shortly after the election when Suzanne R. Swanson, a Conservative elected on the Democratic line began voting with the Republicans on certain issues.  Also Republicans were appointed later on in the term to fill vacancies when two Democrats won seats in the State Assembly. Having cried foul then, Democrats are now hoping to put their candidates back in those slots. More Power for the Board    Observers of this year's contests say, however, that there is more at stake than just partisanship or predicting who will sit on which side of the aisle after Nov. 2. They say that whoever emerges as the victor in the hotly contested county executive's race will have to face yet another opponent: a Board of Legislators that wants more say in the business of governing.

George Frideric Handel's last Italian opera, \"Sosarme,\" had never been recorded, so Johannes Somary, music director of the Taghkanic Chorale, undertook the project with the Yorktown-based chorus. The group's recording of \"Sosarme,\" conducted by Mr. Somary and performed with the Amor Artis Orchestra playing on period instruments, is scheduled for release next spring on compact disks by Newport Classic of Rhode Island.   It was not unusual to find an unrecorded score by a prolific composer like Handel, Mr. Somary said, speaking in his office at the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, where he leads the glee club and is chairman of the arts department. He said he discovered \"Sosarme\" while studying the composer's life and work and found the opera \"dramatically inspired and musically beautiful.\"  Concert Performance Considered    \"When you study a score like this one, you think -- shouldn't that be made available to the public?\" Mr. Somary said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"The Last Pill He'll Ever Take","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/books/crime-mystery-the-last-pill-he-ll-ever-take.html","abstract":"  PROCEDURA By Salvatore Mannuzzu.

Seen from the Cote d'Or hills above its capital, Beaune, the region lacks any particular charm, its indubitable attractions concealed amid a network of highways and modern wine depots that often resemble auto dealerships more than repositories for some of the world's greatest wine. But as you head south toward Lyons and the wine becomes less extraordinary, the scenery gets better and better. The hills of the Cote d'Or and then the Cote Chalonnaise finally assume some real stature, becoming small mountains that range up to 3,500 feet.    There are more trees, and the villages, standing like sentinels on the ridges, have a quiet, almost Italian grace. This land of glorious vistas and charming but ultimately unprofound wines is the Beaujolais.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931017","headline":"A Culinary Victory at a World Equestrian Championship","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/nyregion/a-culinary-victory-at-a-world-equestrian-championship.html","abstract":"  WHILE Austria's equestrian team was outpointing competitors from 23 nations in the World Pair Driving Championship at the Hamilton Farm here, a winning performance by a 250-member culinary team from a hotel in Convent Station was going on behind the scenes.

In the summer and fall of 1850, just after temporarily giving up his cherished project of an operatic \"King Lear\" and just before beginning \"Rigoletto,\" the 36-year-old composer was occupied with a new French play, \"Le Pasteur,\" suggested to him by his librettist Francesco Maria Piave. The subject is a Protestant clergyman, Stiffelius, whose Christian charity is tested by his wife's infidelity.   \"Stiffelio,\" which reached the stage in Trieste in the same year and will be given its first Metropolitan Opera performance on Thursday, is not a \"forgotten\" Verdi opera like \"Macbeth\" and \"Nabucco\" and many others that have been revived. They had successful lives, faded from the stage to make room for newer works and were revived when interest in the new faded in turn. \"Stiffelio\" had almost no chance at life. Censors mangled its story at the premiere and forced some early productions to secularize it entirely. Verdi, convinced that the same would continue to happen, cobbled most of its music into another opera, \"Aroldo,\" with a different plot.

Glass walls would not only change the look of buildings. They would transform the lives of those who lived inside them. Stripped of the opaque, protective cover afforded by old-fashioned masonry buildings, civilization would advance toward a light-filled realm of freedom and candor.   Philip Johnson lives in two glass houses. One is the landmark residence in New Canaan, Conn., he designed for himself in 1949.

Even those who detest Johnson and his architecture will grant his disarming candor. Always quicker than his critics to concede his faults, Johnson long ago perfected the art of self-deprecation as a shield against attacks by others.

The Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contends that fiscal conservatism -- keeping a balanced budget, streamlining city agencies and keeping them off the backs of business -- provides the best hope for the economy. But Mayor Dinkins has unveiled proposals that many see as a sort of industrial policy, with the city marshaling resources to aid 12 industries in the hope that they will become centers of economic growth.

Administration officials responded that they would fight Mr. Dole's proposal on both legal and foreign policy grounds. Legally, they said, such legislation would constitute an infringement on the right of the President to make foreign policy.

And if she isn't, what should operas in our time be about? It's a worthwhile question, for in its grandiose and somewhat distorted way, opera is another of those mirrors culture holds up to the times it lives in.   The very first operas in the early 1600's were about gods and goddesses, a fact explainable by their listeners. Audiences were the height of Venetian nobility; and if opera was by nature larger than their own lives, who else would they have had to look up to? Verdi spent most of his career in the midst of violent struggles toward a unified Italy, hence, perhaps, his taste for historical figures fighting comparable battles in a real or mythic past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931018","headline":"Susan H.

The program was established after the Spanish Civil War, when the Army found that too many recruits didn't know how to shoot.

Mr. Clinton wants to reinstitute a practice, known as tied aid, whereby the U.S. would give development aid to poor countries on condition that they purchase U.S. goods. For example, the U.S. would give Paraguay cash to help build a dam; the U.S. would also provide subsidized loans with which Paraguay would be required to buy the needed construction equipment from U.S. companies. The U.S. largely abandoned this practice 20 years ago because linking aid to exports isn't good for recipient countries or fair trade.   At second glance, however, Mr. Clinton's policy is defensible as a means to pressure other donors to cut back the suspect practice.
