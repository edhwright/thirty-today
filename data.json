Unless each Democrat votes yes, the plan won't clear the committee.    The White House believes it knows how to win over Senators Conrad and Breaux: Shrink and restructure the B.T.U. tax, and offset that lost revenue with additional spending cuts.

It is wrong for Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and other conservative Republican senators to oppose a Presidential nomination for executive office for such disagreement.   Opponents of Professor Guinier argue that since senators used Robert Bork's academic writings against him during his unsuccessful effort to be confirmed as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Professor Guinier's academic writings are likewise a basis to refuse to confirm her as an Assistant Attorney General. What that false analogy overlooks is that when Mr. Bork was nominated for an executive office in the Department of Justice -- solicitor general -- his academic writings were not used against him. Despite strong disagreement with his academic views, senators voted overwhelmingly to confirm him as solicitor general because they knew he was serving as part of the President's team, not as a free agent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"Senate Passes a Civil-Rights Bill To Safeguard Access to Abortion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/nyregion/senate-passes-a-civil-rights-bill-to-safeguard-access-to-abortion.html","abstract":"  Seeking to safeguard access to clinics where abortions are performed, the Connecticut Senate today approved a broad civil-rights statute that would make it a crime to use force or physical obstruction to deny someone the equal protection of state or Federal laws.

But this is a year Mr. Dinkins seems destined to stumble despite his best efforts, as he seeks $280 million in state aid to help close a $500 million budget gap. His allies seem weaker, his opponents more determined and the independents more complacent than usual. Trouble Across the Divide    For Democrats, the problem is largely the state's tight budget. Behind public talk about supporting Mr. Dinkins, there is much private hand wringing about a sluggish economy that has left them few resources for a bailout and many excuses for whittling down the city's plan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"Guatemala's Counter-Coup: A Military About-Face","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/world/guatemala-s-counter-coup-a-military-about-face.html","abstract":"  When President Jorge Serrano Elias startled Guatemalans last week with the announcement that he was dissolving the Congress and suspending the Constitution, his seizure of power seemed to have been accomplished at a stroke.

It's legitimate to argue that the police did a bad job of protecting the Jewish population in Brooklyn's Crown Heights section during the riots in the summer of 1991. The police did do a bad job. But to call the riots a pogrom, as former Mayor Edward Koch, the mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani and others persist in doing, is not only wrong -- and inflammatory -- but an insult to those who lived through the real thing.    My late father didn't speak often about his childhood in Eastern Europe. But when he did it was with a steely anger, a transforming bitterness that he carried with him all 89 years of his life. Though he left Poland when he was only 6, he could vividly recall nights when Cossacks would sweep through his village on horseback, beating, maiming and murdering Jews for one reason -- because they were Jewish. He remembered fleeing and hiding, and he remembered the confused fear of a child who could not make sense of what was, after all, incomprehensible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"The Two-Faced West : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/opinion/IHT-the-twofaced-west-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"One Face of Islam\" (Letters, May 18) by Robert J.

This change should help stabilize all health insurance premiums in this market. However, realistically it will be at least a year before we can accurately analyze its effect.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"PARENT & CHILD","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/style/parent-child.html","abstract":"  DR.

Harmony","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/opinion/l-kurds-and-christians-live-in-harmony-727593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Christian Sects in Kurdish Lands Dwindle\" (letter, May 24), Alastair Bruton claims that the numbers of Christians living in the Kurdish area in the north of Iraq and southeast of Turkey have been reduced from 25,000 to 200 or 300 \"because the Kurds told them they had no future in a land the Kurds would soon control.\" Mr. Bruton concludes by appealing for the linkage of \"safeguards\" to Western aid earmarked for the peoples of Kurdistan-Iraq because otherwise the West will be facilitating \"ethnic cleansing\" there.   Throughout this century, Muslim Kurds and Christian Assyrians and Chaldeans in Kurdistan-Iraq have enjoyed good and cooperative relations. In the 1930's, for example, the Kurds did not retaliate against Christians who displaced them, in collaboration with British colonialists, from the oil-rich area of Kirkuk. More recently, some Christians have joined Kurdish political parties.   In the 1980's, many Christians left the Kurdish area for Baghdad or destinations abroad for economic reasons. Iraqi Kurds, themselves victims of chemical warfare and an operation that, it is estimated, claimed the lives of 180,000 Kurds, were hardly in a position to force any other people out of the region.    Some Christians fled to Turkey in the April 1991 refugee exodus and refused to return for economic reasons or because they had no homes to which to return. This is documented in reports released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in an April 1992 investigation report by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.   In the last year, in preparation for the May 1992 election, the Kurdistan Front set aside 5 seats (out of 105) for Christians in the new Kurdish Parliament. This quota assured the representation of Chaldeans and other Christian groups. Because the two major parties hold 50 seats each, the Christian members of the Kurdish Parliament will cast the deciding votes should a stalemate arise.   As the Iraqi military again looms as an ominous presence on the horizon of Kurdistan-Iraq, the fledgling democracy deserves and needs Western humanitarian aid as long as its leaders apply the law equitably to all people.

Would he paddle down some exotic tributary the way Jean-Georges Vongerichten of Jo-Jo did when he opened Vong? Would he embrace some neglected regional French cuisine?   As a recent visit to Daniel reveals, Mr. Boulud did no such thing. Daniel, on East 76th Street near Fifth Avenue, offers the kind of technically impeccable, labor-intensive French cooking that made Mr. Boulud a star at Le Cirque.

Interviews with some two dozen of the 668 Tony voters, and a few well-informed nonvoters (all were guaranteed anonymity) indicated that the two shows, each of which garnered 11 nominations, were in a dead heat for the best-musical award and that otherwise a division of the spoils is likely. Many agree that the best-musical award could go to one and best director to the other. One prediction -- call it the necessary-but-not-sufficient theory -- espoused by Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, is this: Because the Broadway musical tradition revolves around a good story, \"Kiss\" isn't likely to win best musical without winning best book. And because the pleasure of \"Tommy\" is so tied to its fantastical staging, it isn't likely to win best musical without winning best director. Terrence McNally's book could win, he added, and \"Kiss\" could still lose; ditto for Des McAnuff's direction and \"Tommy.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930604","headline":"U.S. Agency to Review Case Of Scientist on Hunger Strike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/us/us-agency-to-review-case-of-scientist-on-hunger-strike.html","abstract":"  The Department of Health and Human Services will review the case of Walter Stewart, the National Institutes of Health scientist who is in the 25th day of a hunger strike to protest the halting of his investigations of scientific misconduct.

Just ask Barbara and David Blumenthal, who at one point this year accumulated a pile of unpaid claims for doctor visits, lab tests, outpatient procedures and regular checkups for themselves and their three children.   With their medical coverage split between two insurers, Phoenix Home Life and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the Blumenthals were not sure which bills were covered and whether they were being paid fairly for claims.   \"I had lost track of what was outstanding,\" Mrs. Blumenthal said. \"All I knew was that I was missing a lot of money.   Like many two-career couples, the Blumenthals are pressed for time. Both run importing businesses and juggle responsibilities at their home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.   Overwhelmed by the paperwork, Mrs. Blumenthal acted on a friend's recommendation and hired a medical claims agent. Such agents are accustomed to dealing with insurance companies and can handle all the filings and follow-up calls. They also know how and when to challenge insurers over a rejected claim or a paltry reimbursement, say, $15 for a $100 office visit.   Since hiring their insurance go-between, the Blumenthals have received $3,000 in previously unpaid claims and paid the agent $575 in fees, including a $120 annual retainer.   Other families, the chronically ill, the elderly and even some companies are turning to medical claims agents to sort through the maze of insurance red tape. These agents can handle the paperwork arising from a catastrophic illness, address a backlog of claims or be a consultant on retainer.   People in the fledgling industry operate under several names: medical billing agents, public health adjusters and medical insurance consultants. The businesses are so new that there is no classification for them in the Yellow Pages. And they are not licensed or regulated in most states, including New York, which means consumers should check references carefully before selecting an agent.   Even their trade organization, the National Association of Claims Assistance Professionals of Downers Grove, Ill., is only two years old. \"People still don't know we exist,\" said Norma Border, the association's national director. The association, which has 800 members, puts the number of adjusters nationwide at 3,000 to 6,000, and expects business to continue growing even if the Clinton Administration overhauls the nation's health-care system.   Gila Bash Katz, who is the Blumenthals' agent, has enlisted 46 regular clients and one small company, which pays her to handle its employees' claims, since founding Quick Claims Inc. of Eastchester, N.Y., two years ago.   After initial contact, the adjuster will likely agree to make a house call, at no charge, to discuss your claims situation. If you decide to proceed, you will need to sign a limited power of attorney giving the professional the authority to deal directly with the insurance company. The claims adjuster will also need copies of all medical insurance contracts.   The agent's fees may be structured in several ways: a percentage, usually 10 to 15 percent, of the reimbursed amount; an hourly charge of $25 to $55; a specified amount for each claim, or an annual fee.   Rarely do adjusters set a minimum fee, although clients say it is seldom worth signing up until you have amassed at least $2,000 in contested or delayed claims. Threatening letters from hospitals and doctors who have not been paid often send consumers to a medical adjuster.   For the Blumenthals, the medical claims agent has taken on the status of the family lawyer or accountant, handling all medical insurance paperwork and providing advice on related matters. The family permits Ms. Katz to cash its insurance checks, deduct her 15 percent fee and consolidate the smaller reimbursements into a single check. But others may prefer to pay the agent separately.   The elderly, many of whom are covered by Medicare and a supplementary private policy, may look for a claims adjuster familiar with the vagaries of overlapping policies. The Berryhill Medical Claims Service of Danbury, Conn., says about 80 percent of its clients are covered by Medicare and a Medigap policy.    Ursula Milde, director of an elderly outreach program for New Rochelle Hospital in Westchester County, regularly sends people to adjusters. \"I see people who don't know what to send where anymore,\" she said. \"You need itemized bills. You may need to make copies. You must know what's in your policy if they try to reject your claim.\"    Insurance companies are only beginning to become familiar with medical claims adjusters, and insist it is too soon to gauge their effectiveness. But reimbursement is not necessarily quicker, cautioned John Gras, a spokesman for the Prudential-AARP Group Health Insurance.   Still, finding an intermediary to handle insurance headaches has its appeal. Even the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh has hired a medical adjuster, Claim Guard Plus of Indianapolis, to assist its trust clients. \"The volume of paperwork and the number of clients got too high,\" said Marylee Steinmetz, supervisor of the trust insurance unit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Health"},{"date":"19930605","headline":"Child Killed, 2 Wounded In a Spray of Stray Bullets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/05/nyregion/child-killed-2-wounded-in-a-spray-of-stray-bullets.html","abstract":"  Two 7-year-old boys playing in a courtyard behind a Bronx housing project shortly before dark yesterday were struck by stray bullets from a nearby gun battle, killing one and injuring the other, the police said.

Not bad for three men over 50 and a 48-year-old mother of five. What made the excitement all the odder was that during its brief existence (1965 to 1968, in this configuration), the Velvet Underground sold hardly any records at all. Hostile to peace-and-love banalities, irreducibly New York in attitude, the band epitomized the coolness of the downtown Manhattan art scene and the sex-and-drugs danger of the city at night. Division, Then Reunion    Ignored or reviled by the American public and the record industry, the Velvets still had an enormous influence, especially when they were taken up by Andy Warhol and given a temporary new lead singer in Nico, his latest \"superstar.\" Blending Lou Reed's adult poetry with John Cale's vanguard musical experimentation, the Velvets were the parents of the entire art rock, punk, new-wave and college rock scenes worldwide.   Bitterness kept the Velvets apart. Mr. Reed had forced Mr. Cale out in 1968 and embarked on his solo career in 1970. Sterling Morrison, who had been a college classmate of Mr. Reed's at Syracuse University, wouldn't talk to his old friend for years, until a new band contract was signed in 1986, redistributing record royalties.   Mr. Reed was the only one to sustain a visible career. Mr. Cale made and produced some admired records, but his most notable recent achievement was a 1988 commemoration of Warhol, in collaboration with Mr. Reed, called \"Songs for Drella.\" Maureen Tucker, the band's drummer, lived in Georgia, brought up her children, worked in the computer business and played in underground bands. Mr. Morrison eventually earned a Ph.D. in English literature in Texas, working on tugboats in the Gulf of Mexico and playing in Ms. Tucker's latest band. Nico was killed in a bicycle accident in Ibiza in 1988.   In 1990, at the invitation of the Cartier Foundation, the four surviving band members got together in Paris for a Warhol tribute. That led to a quasi-impromptu public rendition of one of their most famous songs, \"Heroin,\" but was no proper reunion. For that, another meeting in New York, followed by two days of trial-run practice sessions, was necessary before the current European tour got the go-ahead.   The watchword for the reunion is fun. Band members have used the word in many interviews, and while it may be their actual motivating factor, it is also a conscious strategy to subvert cosmic expectations. The problem with a Velvet Underground reunion is that nothing the band will do can match the legend that has grown up around it. As David Sinclair wrote on Monday in The Times of London, \"The group's unique godhead status will begin to diminish almost from the moment they start their first number.\" Fun and Money    Clearly their ambitions are serious, and include the courting of a mass audience that was never theirs in the 1960's. The first big concert takes place tomorrow at the 13,000-seat Wembley Arena in London, with four stadium dates with the Irish band U2 at the end of the month and an appearance at the huge Glastonbury Festival in England on July 25. All of this for a band that never played in Europe.   The four musicians say they have no plans for further activity, but they surely have expectations. An album to be recorded live in Paris from June 15 to 17 will be released by Sire, presumably to coordinate with American performances. The issue is not whether the band will perform in the United States, but when and under what circumstances. \"We're all going our separate ways,\" Mr. Reed said in a group interview between shows in Edinburgh. \"But if anything came up and it seemed very special and it seemed like fun, we'd be receptive.\"   This will mean money, which most of the band members can use. But all four seem sufficiently aware of -- proud of, burdened by, amused at -- their legend not to wish it squandered out of simple greed. They insist they reunited only because they became convinced that their material still held up, still made sense and could still be played best by them. Above all, they resented being intimidated by their own reputation. \"Should we stay in hiding just because a myth is loose in the land?\" Mr. Morrison asked.   No attempt has been made to recreate the exact sound of the old, technically primitive recordings. New equipment lends the band's sound a solidity and variety it never had before. Sylvia Reed, Mr. Reed's wife and manager, is now the Velvets' manager and the designer of their contemporary-looking stage lighting. Mr. Cale has fretted about looking and sounding too slick.   At rehearsals, they relearned the words and musical structures of the old songs and then developed them at will. (Mr. Cale had to learn songs created after his departure; he also now sings a couple of Nico favorites.)   \"We never played them the same way twice back then, so why should we now?\" Mr. Reed asked. As Mr. Cale has said, \"We're in the business of remythologizing, not demythologizing.\" Although repertory for this tour consists basically of old band material, they are gingerly working in some new numbers, including a most effective -- and inescapably Velvet Undergroundish -- item called \"Cast the First Stone\" as the third and final encore Thursday night. Building Enthusiasm    British critics have so far been mixed in their reactions, \"Cleaning up their act seems like cheating,\" one wrote before he had heard a note. Another came right out and argued that since the members of Velvet Underground had purveyed death, they should have died, long ago. But others seemed more impressed then they had expected to be.   \"The language the Velvet Underground invented still communicates the rock 'n' roll verities,\" wrote the critic for The Glasgow Herald. Mr. Sinclair, in The Times of London, seemed to recant his earlier pessimism: \"This show did not produce a feeling of deja vu,\" he wrote on Thursday, \"more an impression that, after 25 years, the rest of the world has only just caught up with them.\"   Those who attended both Edinburgh shows found the second, on Thursday, far superior to the first. Nervousness had receded, and the band was beginning to generate an excitement that will surely build over the tour. Certainly the audience loved it, standing throughout the two-hour set and cheering wildly.   Indeed, there was much to cheer. Mr. Reed still sings with the same ominous distinctiveness; Mr. Cale is still the same multi-faceted musical saboteur; Mr. Morrison still contributes a guitar sound of weight and solidity. The revelation on Thursday, though, was the diminutive Ms. Tucker's drumming. Standing at her kit and whacking away, she makes a tom-toms-of-doom sound that inspired straight-ahead punk drumming for a generation. The effect is not quirky or amateurish; it is rocklike in the granitic sense of that word, the foundation on which the band could build a creative future to match its potently nostalgic past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930605","headline":"North Korea Isn't Convinced It Should Stay in Nuclear Pact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/05/world/north-korea-isn-t-convinced-it-should-stay-in-nuclear-pact.html","abstract":"  United States negotiators failed again today to persuade North Korea to drop its plans to withdraw next week from an international treaty intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
