This Los Angeles singer and songwriter, who on Tuesday evening gave the first of his three concerts this week at the Nederlander Theater in Manhattan, has just released \"I'm Alive\" (Elektra), a recording of searching personal love songs that are very close in style and feeling to those on his 1974 album, \"Late for the Sky.\" And on Tuesday, the 45-year-old singer, who seems hardly to have aged over two decades, performed a brilliant, low-key concert in which the artistic powers that seemed to be deserting him during much of the 1980's were back in full force.   Mr. Browne developed his reputation in the early 1970's as a folk-rock songwriter with a singular gift for describing the emotional landscapes of intimate relationships. In language that was direct but slightly elevated, he distilled a vision that linked his faith in an idealized romantic love with the utopian post-hippie ethos of the period.

The parents of young children have awakened to the alarming sound of a clock that's signaling a dash toward a little-league soccer game, or to the cheerful, high-pitched plaints of you-know-who. A long day looms.   Didn't we used to look at art on Saturdays? Yes, dear, we did, but the museums are too crowded for our merry band now, and gallery workers frown audibly at small bodies sliding across those shiny floors. And besides, Morley Safer indicated recently on \"60 Minutes\" that we're suckers for believing that anything made in our 40-ish lifetimes might be art. Sure, the question \"Is it art?\" is a loutish exercise in reductive reasoning, but quickly following are the slightly more respectable, \"If it's art, is it a good painting or sculpture, i.e., better than that one over there?\" and, \"Why is it worth $275,000?\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"A Disneyland of History Next to the Real Thing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/us/a-disneyland-of-history-next-to-the-real-thing.html","abstract":"  To the shock and utter exuberance of many in this thoroughly rural village 35 miles from the White House, the Walt Disney Company unwrapped plans today for a new amusement park that would relive the grand sweep of American history.

As he languorously stretches his legs, the performer, wearing full makeup, a woman's marcelled wig and a glittering circus suit, is a dead ringer for the Parisian legend as pictured in well-known photographs taken by Man Ray. But he is also more than that. In the show's exquisite lighting, Mr. Kelly glows like a human jewel radiating a mysterious brilliance in a luminescent purple haze.    That visual payoff, as haunting as it may be, is a little late in arriving in the leisurely paced 90-minute collage, which had the first of four performances at the Majestic on Wednesday evening. What Mr. Kelly, who wrote, choreographed, and directed the piece, has created is an often lovely but overly drawn-out meditation on muses, ghosts, Paris in the 20's, transvestism, and the art of Jean Cocteau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/arts/art-in-review-816993.html","abstract":"  Noriyuki Haraguchi   Akira Ikeda  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through Nov. 20    The Japanese sculptor Noriyuki Haraguchi's particular gift is for making an elegant -- sometimes too elegant -- thing of industrial forms and materials, as he has demonstrated in two consecutive solo exhibitions, his first in New York.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Senator Targets Bowls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/sports/sports-people-colleges-senator-targets-bowls.html","abstract":"  At the request of Senator MITCH McCONNELL, Republican of Kentucky, the United States Justice Department has agreed to look into whether an agreement between a coalition of college conferences and major post-season bowls violates antitrust laws.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/style/chronicle-821593.html","abstract":"  Organizers of a benefit for the American Ballet Theater on Monday are billing it as a \"family party,\" but the evening will hardly be a couple of relatives around the kitchen table.

It is a circumstance that was thrown into sharp relief last week when the producers of \"Perestroika,\" Part 2 of \"Angels in America,\" announced they were postponing its opening from Thursday, Nov. 18, until the following Tuesday, thus upsetting what had been a rather precariously balanced schedule.   Producers of Broadway shows are required to register their opening nights with the League of American Theaters and Producers, reserving the dates as long in advance as possible so that the league can orchestrate schedules and keep conflicts to a minimum. Less officially but for the convenience of all, the league has for the last few years also kept track of Off Broadway openings, but the Off Broadway theaters all understand that they are somewhat at the mercy of Broadway shows, which take precedence. Indeed, weeks ago, when \"Perestroika\" first assumed the Nov. 18 date, it bumped the Manhattan Theater Club's production of Donald Margulies's play \"The Loman Family Picnic.\" The theater then moved \"Loman\" to Nov. 23, where last Friday it found itself under the feet of \"Angels\" once again.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931112","headline":"Sports of The Times; Acknowledge The Past; Pass It On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-acknowledge-the-past-pass-it-on.html","abstract":"  RITUAL?
