She is a familiar figure to readers and booksellers here as well as in her native Britain, so much so that three million copies of her 19 novels are in print in the United States alone.    That is why it comes as such a shock to those who know her and those who read her that Miss Perry, who is 55 and lives with her mother in the tiny Scottish village of Portmahomack, has a hidden past as startling as anything in the most melodramatic mystery story. Forty years ago, sent to New Zealand to recover from an illness, Miss Perry committed a murder. Just 15, she served five and a half years in prison before changing her name and beginning a new life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940817","headline":"Hampton Back At Practice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/17/sports/pro-football-hampton-back-at-practice.html","abstract":"  Rodney Hampton was back at Giants practice today, although a little lighter in the pocketbook, a day after being a no-show for the team's first workout since its return from Berlin on Sunday night.   \"Something came up, a family problem, and I had to leave town,\" explained Hampton, who said he flew to Baton Rouge, La., early Monday morning. \"I tried to call Dan\" -- Coach Dan Reeves -- \"and I left a message.

But through it all, one important contributor to osteoporosis has been largely overlooked: the role played by medications that have bone loss as a major side effect. In a new booklet, the National Osteoporosis Foundation calls attention to this unfortunate effect of many important medications, not to frighten those who must take them but to suggest that adjustments in treatment or greater attention to prevention might help protect the bones while accomplishing the desired therapeutic goal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940817","headline":"Whitewater Hearing Tests Public's Endurance; So Long to the Best","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/17/opinion/l-whitewater-hearing-tests-public-s-endurance-so-long-to-the-best-984604.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   People often ask how we can attract young, intelligent, dedicated people to government service.

ROBERT C. SMITH    Republican of New Hampshire. A staunch conservative from a low-tax state, he strongly opposes the Mitchell bill, partly because he says it would impose 17 new taxes. He also contends that the Mitchell bill would throw out the nation's present medical care system and replace it with a vast Federal bureaucracy, that it would create three new entitlement programs, that it would diminish the choice of plans by establishing a standardized benefits package, and would require some employers to pay for their workers' health insurance. MARK O. HATFIELD    Republican of Oregon. Senator Hatfield opposes the Mitchell bill, partly because he says it does not address cost containment. In addition, he contends the Mitchell measure would pre-empt existing Oregon laws, including one that bars punitive damages in malpractice suits, which he says reduces costs by cutting malpractice premiums. He also regards as too low the Mitchell provision that calls for 1.75 percent of insurance premiums to be earmarked for medical research. BILL BRADLEY    Democrat of New Jersey.

We've had several examples in the very recent weeks of employers for good companies that had their health care canceled for all of their employees because of the incidence of illness among just a few of their employees and just effectively canceled out within a two- or three-month period.   There's also the exclusion of any service from coverage, even a service that might turn out to be most important to you if someone in your family becomes seriously ill.   And no American is guaranteed choice.   And I think these following points are worthwhile to keep in mind:   If your employer doesn't offer a plan you like, you can be out of luck. And 84 percent of employers offer only one plan. Of the employers that make available health insurance to their employees, they provide one plan. Effectively, out of luck if you wanted an alternative choice. You take it or leave it.   Secondly, if your employer doesn't offer a plan that allows you to keep your family doctor, you're also out of luck. . . .   And the Dole plan is better than the status quo alternative, but it's still I don't believe good enough. The insurance companies can still impose pre-existing-condition limitations, they can sell you a policy that doesn't cover the service you may need the most . . . because policies aren't required to provide comprehensive coverage. STATEMENT BY SENATOR SMITH     My office has received thousands of phone calls and letters, more phone calls and letters, I think, than anything since I've been in the Congress, on the issue of health care reform. Both sides.    I hosted a statewide health care conference earlier this year, in April, that featured leading policy experts from every facet of the health care delivery system. There were doctors, and there were providers and nurses and patients and everyone who had in some way had an impact, or were impacted by any change in legislation in the health care industry. . . .    In addition to that, I have 10 counties in my state and I have held a town meeting in each of those counties. . . . We were there to directly hear from constituents regarding the issue of health care reform. And they spoke out. There were hundreds of them, in all of those town meetings, more than any ever attended any of my citizen forums on any issue. . . .   In short, I guess the fairest thing to say is I've heard New Hampshire speak to me, with me, on this issue. And overwhelmingly what they're saying is that they don't want the Government any more involved in health care than it is already involved now. In other words, less Government involvement.   I think there's a concern, unfortunately, that comes through as I listen to these constituents and providers, and all of those who are in any way affected by this pending legislation. There's a concern that the Government is going to do something to me on this issue.   I think that's coming through loud and clear, and it's a very valid concern: Rather than helping us, they're going to do something to me that may cost me my good quality health care.   And the polls, the national polls, which have changed dramatically from overwhelming support to what President Clinton had proposed to the opposite now, . . . show that Americans share the same feelings as those people in New Hampshire. So I don't think there's a great difference between the states, no matter what state you represent on this issue.    I believe that based on what I have heard, people that I've talked with, that most Americans would oppose not only the underlying finance bill, which is technically on the floor, but also the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt, or Clinton-Mitchell bill, as we have here. Fifty-three percent, according to the polls, worry that Congress will pass a plan that gives the Federal Government too much control. And that's a very valid concern. They're suspicious because Government has proven again and again that it's not efficient, it's not compassionate, it's not thrifty and therefore shouldn't be trying to provide for the health care needs of people, least of all health care.    If a mistake is made by a Government official in, perhaps, the administration of the I.R.S., or some other program -- post office, perhaps, late delivering the mail -- it's a problem, maybe, but it's a minor problem compared to some slip-up in the treatment of your health. STATEMENT BY SENATOR HATFIELD     What we're trying to do in Oregon is to provide everybody with standard, primary health care. We're not going to separate every Siamese twin born in Oregon; we're not going to guarantee, in essence, that everybody has the right to any medical procedure -- over 9,000 of them under Medicare alone. We have prioritized them.   People say, Oh, that's rationing health care. Well, we're rationing health care, yes, but we're doing that today under an economic face which is certainly discriminatory, far more discriminatory than saying to a person 80 years old, If you have a life expectancy added to your life by one year, are we going to engage in a very costly medical procedure as against covering 100 women with prenatal care? No. We can't afford to do it.   Now that gets down to where the real rubber hits the road in terms of having to make the tough decisions that somehow we're going to offer anyone any medical procedure or access to any medical procedure. That's the implication, because we've not addressed those thousands of medical procedures and we . . . have the attitude that any one of them -- and it's very, very clear -- any one of them would be open for anyone.   What Oregon has done is it focuses on the provision of preventive health care services and assesses an access to primary health care before serious health problems develop. Now, it looks at the effectiveness of treatment, it draws lines, as I say, to exclude payment of services that are not effective nor add to the individual's quality of life.   I think we have to face this reality in the national picture as well. STATEMENT BY SENATOR MITCHELL     I hope the American people will not be fooled by the rhetoric they're hearing here today. And I hope the American people will also think about the irony of these Republican senators getting up here day after day after day and denouncing Government health insurance and Government health care as bad for their constituents even as they benefit from it themselves as individuals and their families.    Every member of this Senate participates in the Government-run health insurance system that's available to all Federal employees. And the Government pays 72 percent of the cost of that health insurance for these Republican senators who are standing here telling their constituents that it's bad for the constituents even as they participate in it for themselves and their families.   You American taxpayers are paying through the Government, 72 percent of the cost of health insurance in a Government-organized health insurance system for the very Republican senators who are now telling you that you shouldn't want Government-run health insurance.    And you are entitled to ask yourselves if it is so bad for you, why is it so good for them and their families.   Has one of them stood up and said, \"My constituents, Government health insurance is bad for you, and to prove how much I believe that statement, I'm going to voluntarily drop out of the Government insurance system. And I'm going to put my family in the same place where your family is.\"   Have you heard one say that yet? No. And you're not likely to.    Now that's just the insurance. Now let's talk about direct care.   If one of these Republican senators doesn't feel well, if he gets a headache, or his stomach aches, he walks a few feet down the Capitol and he goes to the office of the Capitol physician, a Government employee. He is greeted by a clerk who is a Government employee, checked by a nurse who is a Government employee and then goes in to see the doctor, who is a Government employee.    If Government health care is so bad, why do these Republican senators insist on having it for themselves? And then if they get sick, if the doctor says, You've got to go to the hospital, they go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital, or the Walter Reed Army Hospital, Government hospitals. Well, my gosh, ask yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. America, If these Government facilities are so bad, why do these Republican senators want to go there themselves?   And it's not just senators. President Reagan and President Bush were in their capacities as President the most powerful men in the world. And they were independently wealthy, and they could have gone anywhere in the world when they got sick.   And where did they go? Why they went to these Government hospitals. And who can forget the photographs taken of them waving out the window to the public and the press in those Government hospitals?    Why, are you telling us that it's good enough for Presidents, but it's not good enough for ordinary Americans? STATEMENT BY SENATOR BRADLEY     The Senate's effort to reform the American system of health care has important consequences for all Americans. It will determine the availability and the extent of health care for each of us. It will determine in part how long our parents will live and how healthy our children will be.   As we debate this issue, let's remember what brought us here in the first place. We are not debating this issue by chance. There's a reason why we all speak of this effort as health care reform. In dozens of living rooms and conference halls, in emergency rooms of hospitals and on street corners, the message that I hear from the people of New Jersey is that we need reform.   Our current system is not working as it should; those who have health coverage are paying too much for it, and those without health coverage deserve it. . . .   What people want most is some control of escalating health care costs. What people fear the most is losing their health care if they change jobs or get laid off or lose a job because of a corporate bankruptcy.   What perplexes them as well, when they're confronted with all these escalating costs of health care, is the power of the insurance industry. Want coverage for your heart problem? The insurance company says no because it's a pre-existing condition. In other words, the insurance company will insure you for everything but the heart condition that is most likely to generate the health costs for your family.   In confronting skyrocketing health care costs, small business is left to the mercy of insurance companies. Small businesses have no leverage to negotiate with insurance companies. Too often they're presented with a take-it or leave-it choice that only offers exorbitant costs for health care coverage.   Each of us can enumerate countless occasions in our states when we've had interactions with small-business people who've simply said they can't afford to cover the workers in their particular small business, they can't afford to cover because they were told by the insurance company that it's $6,000 or $7,000 a person and they have no leverage to negotiate with the insurance company.   If you get open-heart surgery, the tab is $49,000. A Caesarean section birth, $7,500.   Remarkably, women of higher incomes have more Caesarean section births. I don't think that's related to a differential in the size of the birth canal; it's related to the ability to afford to pay.   And a visit to an orthopedist, $300 for the first visit, $175 for each visit after that.   Most people have become accustomed to good health care, even with these costs. The health care simply costs too much, more than it should cost.    When President Clinton proposed health care reform last year, none of us thought he was imagining the problem. There was consensus that we should act, we should do something. The political noise of the last 12 months aside, health care reform is as needed today as it was then. The families who need it are still here, in New Jersey and all of our states. The families that don't have the health care need it as much today as they did a year ago. All those of us who were paying health costs today are paying too much today, just as we were paying too much a year ago. . . .   It is the job of Government to protect the public health and welfare in the short and long term of its citizens.   How to do this in the area of health care is the essence of what this debate is all about. Our fundamental goal should be to enable a competitive health care marketplace to keep people healthy but take care of them when it does not.   By and large, America's health care system is an excellent system, but it does have a few glaring faults. We should block or undermine those elements that work in our current system. We should fix those areas that don't work, and in so doing, improve the overall system.   Recent trends suggest the health care markets are becoming more competitive and efficient. We can spur that process by insuring that insurance companies compete on price and quality, not on their ability to omit high-risk patients. Managed competition is beginning to bring better health care at lower prices to many Americans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940818","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/us/inside-986461.html","abstract":"  Victim's Kin Get Children   Two children whose Jordanian father fled with them to Jordan after killing their mother left Amman to return to New Jersey in the custody of their mother's relatives.

Most of those 2,500 troops are protecting a security zone in southwestern Rwanda where more than 600,000 people, mostly Hutu, have fled, fearing reprisal killings by a new Tutsi-dominated Government. Observers fear that when the French leave, so will the unprotected Hutu, making a second human wave across the border into Zaire, where some 800,000 refugees already languish in disease-ridden, makeshift camps.    But unlike the last Rwandan exodus, this one can be foreseen. An obvious preventive step would be to persuade France to stay until a planned U.N. peacekeeping force, made up of troops from African nations, can be assembled -- a matter of weeks, not months. Objections to a longer French stay, however, arise not in Paris, though there is a clamor to bring the troops home, but among suspicious leaders of the new regime in Kigali.

In the concert hall, audiences do not carve meat or drive a car but instead concentrate exclusively on the music, for the most part. There is a sort of attention surplus, which conductors like Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Trevor Pinnock have tried to balance out with sharp-edged, revved-up interpretations. Tafelmusik, which has been recording prolifically of late for Sony Classical, favors a more laid-back, elegant sound, not manically precise: Jeanne Lamon leads from the first-violin chair. The music sounds very much as it might have sounded in the 18th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940818","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/sports/transactions-990949.html","abstract":"  Baseball  National League   MONTREAL EXPOS -- Named Bill Gelvett, director of player development, and Neal Huntington assistant director of player development.

It can't be an easy course to teach these days, with the market still becalmed, but the group exhibition that caps these \"Artist in the Marketplace\" sessions is a reward in itself, and this year's installment is a good one.   As might be expected in a show with 35 participants, eclecticism reigns and quality is uneven. The show gets off to a nice start with Mindy Belloff's installation of dozens of tiny paintings, displayed on shelves or wall racks. Images of flowers and faux Chinese landscapes crop up, although much of the painting is a kind of minuscule version of gestural abstraction. Predominantly black-and-white, the installation has a mournful air, made literal when Ms. Belloff writes on one painting, \"I still get overwhelmed when I think about her\" and the single word \"endure\" on another.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940819","headline":"For Hitchcock, It's a Pennant Race in AAA","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/sports/baseball-for-hitchcock-it-s-a-pennant-race-in-aaa.html","abstract":"  Sterling Hitchcock, the major league pitcher moonlighting in a minor league uniform with the strike persisting, was not flawless while wearing that uniform tonight.

This moonlighting gig was no breeze.   But Hitchcock did not let the early problems overwhelm him; he usually never does.

The White House, staring at the prospect of a crippled Presidency, will compromise or threaten, depending on what it takes to get the votes to move the bill.   Given the generally craven environment, it is refreshing to see Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York taking over the unoccupied high ground of a smarter, loftier bipartisan politics. Stating that his obligations as Mayor outweigh party loyalty, he has been campaigning for the Clinton crime bill.

Lasker Swimming Pool and Skating Rink   Central Park  Harlem Meer (south of 110th Street)  Manhattan  (212) 534-7639  Recommended for all ages    Spotting the Lasker pool from afar, one child thought the turquoise vision was a mirage. And it's true that from a distance on a humid morning, this 28-year-old pool, set amid the greenness of the park, seems unreal. Thankfully, it is very real, having recently reopened after a $2.8 million renovation.   The water sparkles and seems extra clean, probably because the pool has a new, more efficient filtration system; chlorination, formerly done manually, is now performed automatically, Vijay Gupta, the renovation project's chief mechanical engineer, explained. Unsightly concrete walls and gutters have been replaced with sleek stainless steel, and access ramps, showers and water fountains for the disabled have been added. The tulip and cascade fountains, which hadn't worked in about five years, now gush like geysers, making splashy kiddie pools.   But what most children care about is feeling carefree. Travis Lee, a 9-year-old who lives nearby, said it's a great pool because it's not too deep and he feels safe. (And the lifeguards are easy to spot in their neon-orange outfits.)   There are lockers (take your own lock), a snack bar and stadiumlike seating. Hours: 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily through Sept. 5. Attendance at city pools drops in August, so the pool is likely to be uncrowded, especially before noon and after 5 P.M. Ferry Ride   NY Waterway  World Financial Center  West Street (between Vesey and Liberty Streets)  Lower Manhattan  (800) 53-FERRY  Monday through Friday    A lot of ferries zip across the Hudson River from Manhattan and New Jersey docks, but only one takes you from the World Financial Center to the Colgate clock at Exchange Place in Jersey City. Indeed, the ride from Manhattan, where you can see the oversize clock across the water, drops you off almost under the timepiece. It's a brief (five minutes) but glorious voyage from state to state, brisk enough to leave your hair looking like meringue if you sit on the ferry's open deck.   The clock sits on a large structure that looks like scaffolding, next to a sign that reads \"Colgate\" in red letters. Up close, looking at the large minute and hour hands, which are black with red in the middle, you understand what it must have felt like to be a Lilliputian.   When we arrived on a recent visit, the clock read 3:27 P.M.; we watched the minute hand move, ever so slowly, to 3:28 P.M. There are rungs around the clock face so that the repairman can make his way around (a tiny shed, way up high in back of the clock, might be, we figured, where that person lives.) We then walked through the adjacent parking lot to Exchange Place and a pier called the J. Owen Grundy Park. One man was fishing and had caught one, which he said he would feed to his cat. By the time we were back at the clock, it read 4:09 and a young visitor said, \"We've been through a lot of minutes.\"   The Colgate-World Financial Center ferry runs only on weekdays and leaves about every 15 minutes from Manhattan, starting at 6:52 A.M. and continuing until 9:45 P.M. Children 6 and under ride free; the round-trip fare for adults is $4. On Saturdays and Sundays, ferries depart from the World Financial Center for Hoboken or Liberty State Park in New Jersey. 'Brooklyn Dodgers'   Brooklyn Historical Society  128 Pierrepont Street (at Clinton Street)  Brooklyn Heights  (718) 624-0890  Recommended ages: 5 and up    At least one 6-year-old boy in the baseball universe continues to look at the newspaper every day as if the major league games were still churning along. He also talks about how Paul O'Neill (a Yankee) and Rico Brogna (of the Mets) are faring, as if they were still playing. So in the continuing effort to stave off reality, we visited this show devoted to the long-ago Brooklyn Dodgers, who left in 1957 for Los Angeles.   Here's what the young fan considered important: a 10-cent comic-book cover depicting Jackie Robinson, as well as a picture of him as he signed on as a Dodger in 1947; a Pee Wee Reese baseball card; a base from Ebbets Field; the mitt Mickey Owen used in the fourth game of the 1941 World Series; a newspaper photograph of Ebbets Field being demolished by a wrecker's ball and assorted Dodger uniforms, bats and gloves.   This is but a small part of a permanent exhibition on Brooklyn neighborhoods and history, yet it could be significant for someone suffering the baseball-strike blues. (For a few guffaws, you should also seek out the funny mirror, circa 1920, in the Coney Island section.) The society is open Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $2.50 for adults and $1 for children; free for all on Wednesdays. Summergarden   The Museum of Modern Art  The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden  14 West 54th Street  Manhattan  (212) 708-9491  Recommended for all ages  Through Aug. 27    Not even the warning of thunderstorms could keep one family from venturing out last Saturday night in the city, and it wasn't to see \"The Lion King.\" (That had been done the night before.) The parents were desperate for high culture -- the Summergarden classical-music concerts at the Museum of Modern Art, in this case -- and were even optimistic that the children might appreciate it (or, at worst, be lulled to sleep).   But the thunderstorm got in the way and the concert was canceled. The family returned home in the rain, uninspired and unhappy. Maybe another family will have better luck this weekend or next. The concerts, performed by musicians from the Juilliard School, are in their eighth year; the theme this summer is early 20th-century music.   \"It's not fairy-tale music,\" said Sheila Porter, the concert's publicity agent, \"but some kids really dig the music.\" The informality of Summergarden has, in fact, been attracting families (including infants, Ms. Porter said), even though it makes for a late evening. (The free concerts begin at 8:30 and end by 10 P.M.) There are no formal intermissions, but brief gaps between pieces allow families to make swift, discreet exits, if necessary. Just don't knock over the Lachaise with your stroller.   The garden opens at 6 P.M. for the 8:30 P.M. concerts, on Friday and Saturday nights. Ms. Porter suggests arriving by 7 P.M. to get one of the 400 garden chairs (some people take their own seating). Sandwiches, juice, wine and beer are sold in the garden, and dinner is served in the museum's restaurant from 5 to 11:30 P.M. (The museum is also open on Fridays until 8:30 P.M. and Saturdays until 6 P.M.) This weekend, the program is music for piano; next weekend, the Mosaic String Quartet is to play. Keep in Mind    \"REVEALING ROOTS: UNCOVERING INFLUENCES ON CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN PUPPET THEATER,\" an exhibition of various styles of puppets, divided by culture and heritage, including African, Mexican, Japanese, Indonesian, American Northwest and European traditions. Through Sept. 30. Hours: Monday and Thursday, noon to 8 P.M. and Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, noon to 6 P.M. At the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 40 Lincoln Center Plaza, at West 65th Street. Free.

Kerlin Learning Center, Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx. Tomorrow and Sunday, 1 to 4 P.M. Free with museum admission: $4 for adults, $2 for children 6 and up.

At the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 39 Sco fieldtown Road, Stamford, Conn. Hours: 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through Saturday and holidays; 1 to 5 P.M., Sunday. Fees: $4 for adults and $3 for children.

These old-school rappers have worn some with age, but they've managed to keep their drumbeats simple, their voices strong and their boasts original. The show tonight is to begin at 8; admission is $27.50 and $37.50. NEIL STRAUSS Ultra Bide    Ultra Bide, Brownie's, 169 Avenue A at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. Ultra Bide is made up of three young Japanese rockers living in New York City and making hard and heavy music. Its songs squeal in and out of tune, clattering as much as they rock. Everyone in the trio sings in a sinister scream, making innocent lyrics like \"I want to walk in the sunshine with you\" seem more like threats. The show is Saturday night at 1; admission is $6. N. S. Holmes Brothers    Holmes Brothers, Celebrate Brooklyn Blue Weekend, Prospect Park Band Shell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, (718) 768-0699. The Holmes Brothers' songs mix blues, soul, gospel and country. The music moves slowly and painfully, much like the band's career. It took the group three decades to release its first album, the bittersweet \"In the Spirit,\" which came out three years ago. Two albums later, the Holmes Brothers' wrenching tales of heartbreak and redemption, of private sorrows and small consolations, are starting to attract the audience they deserve. The free concert begins at 7 P.M. on Saturday. N.

At the ocean the wind whips the waves into a ferocious froth, and birds call mournfully to one another across peaceful bays. Meanwhile, traffic jams the roads of all the pretty villages as tourists honk, jostling for an opportunity to park in front of the specialty food shops that line the streets. The Hamptons have so many stores selling edible items that a Martian dropping in might wonder whether human beings ever think about anything but their stomachs. This rage to eat is understandable. Fishermen come back from the sea with their boats filled with tuna, mackerel and swordfish. Anybody with a permit can pick up all the clams he can consume. Lobsters are plentiful and chickens range freely.   At this time of year the fields are filled with the world's best tomatoes and corn. Even a mediocre cook can produce a fabulous meal in no time. So why are people lining up for French cheeses and Italian pastas and caviar from the Caspian? What explains this mania for croissants and cappuccino? And how come restaurants serving barely passable pasta are so busy that it takes weeks to get a reservation? The truth is that if people just wanted great food, in the Hamptons they would buy local foods and stay home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940819","headline":"Nassau Gets Bill for District Map, and Gulps","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/nyregion/nassau-gets-bill-for-district-map-and-gulps.html","abstract":"  Two months ago, a Federal judge warned the Nassau County Supervisors that it would be costly if they failed to agree on district lines for a new county legislature.

Historically, baseball has never come close to having its unique immunity from antitrust laws repealed by Congress.

Lahti, best known for its skiing facilities, has somehow accomplished the feat. Its 60-piece orchestra, some of whose members appeared at St. Peter's Church on Wednesday night for a chamber concert, has acquired an international reputation through a series of recordings on the Bis and Ondine labels, covering a rich swath of repertory from its homeland.   The best of these, on Bis, was the first complete recording of Sibelius's \"Tempest\" music, a gloriously inventive score that penetrates to the heart of Shakespeare's last play. With the violinist Leonidas Kavakos, the orchestra also gave the world premiere of the original version of Sibelius's Violin Concerto -- indeed, the only performance and recording, since the Sibelius family has not allowed any others. Other disks have presented the complete orchestral music of Joonas Kokkonen, the most distinguished of older Finnish composers, and the startling polystylistic scores of Kalevi Aho, who has become the orchestra's composer in residence and has written his Eighth, Ninth and 10th Symphonies in Lahti.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940819","headline":"Homeless Man Is Stabbed After Halting Break-In","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/nyregion/homeless-man-is-stabbed-after-halting-break-in.html","abstract":"  Frank Mayo knew everybody on West 95th Street, and everybody on West 95th Street knew Frank Mayo.

Cachao's ensemble included a tres (small guitar), congas, timbales, trumpet, trombone, saxophone, three vocalists and an electric piano. The group sound was transparent but kinetic.
