Several State Department officials complained in interviews that while Washington had recognized the republic, the delay in sending an ambassador there was strengthening Greece's resolve to maintain its trade embargo against Macedonia. Many officials say the delay is dangerously heightening tensions in the Balkans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940419","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/19/nyregion/c-corrections-829234.html","abstract":"  An article yesterday about modifications offered by Senator George J.

At the Beacon, something even stranger happened. The naturally charismatic Mr. Vollenweider began to disappear under the weight of the band, becoming a supporting player on his own stage.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred separately. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion that was also signed by Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who also filed his own dissenting opinion. FROM THE DECISION By Justice Blackmun    In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), this Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment governs the exercise of peremptory challenges by a prosecutor in a criminal trial. The Court explained that although a defendant has \"no right to a 'petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race,' \" . . . the \"defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria.\" Since Batson, we have reaffirmed repeatedly our commitment to jury selection procedures that are fair and nondiscriminatory. We have recognized that whether the trial is criminal or civil, potential jurors, as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to jury selection procedures that are free from state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice. . . .","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940420","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/nyregion/news-summary-834181.html","abstract":"  International A3-13  SOUTH AFRICA BOYCOTT CANCELED  Zulu nationalist leaders in South Africa called off a boycott of the first all-race elections, greatly increasing hopes for a peaceful transition to democracy there.

Yet at the end of the Bach, a Romantic undercurrent emerged in the form of a Mendelssohnian rhythmic bounce. And a more thunderous variety of Romanticism prevailed in the rest of the program. A Scriabin group was as misty and temperamental as the Bach was transparent.

So there was a certain gravity to its first concert in Carnegie Hall on Monday night (its second was last night).  The curious thing was that though the Dresden is probably the oldest organized group of musicians in the world, it seemed to be seeking its voice. In fact, under Mr. Sinopoli's direction the orchestra sounded much less experienced and coherent than either the Vienna or the Berlin Philharmonic, merely striplings by comparison, which have also passed through town in recent months.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940420","headline":"Frenchman Convicted of Crimes Against the Jews in '44","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/world/frenchman-convicted-of-crimes-against-the-jews-in-44.html","abstract":"  Almost 50 years after he ordered the execution of seven Jews while he was serving in a pro-Nazi militia, Paul Touvier today became the first Frenchman to be found guilty of crimes against humanity during World War II.

Ms. Kimura's teachers have included Joseph Fuchs, Roman Totenberg, Toshiya Eto and Armand Weisbord. She has studied composition with Mario Davidovsky at Columbia University and has played widely at international festivals. Her interest, though, is not in the traditional repertory, but in the most recent attempts at liberation from it.

President Clinton should publicly reproach Greece for its economic embargo against the Republic of Macedonia and get a firm commitment that the Greek leader will stop coddling Serbia.   The Greeks are upset over Macedonia's name, which they consider the exclusive property of their northernmost region, over its constitution, which promises protection for Macedonians outside its borders, and over its flag, which contains the Hellenistic 16-pointed star. Mr. Papandreou's predecessor as Prime Minister, the conservative Constantine Mitsotakis, played on the dispute to retain his thin parliamentary majority.

Endless negotiations, lawsuits and now the appearance of political favoritism have made this into a deal that every responsible citizen and officeholder must view with alarm. The public's best interest can be clearly stated: Mr. Zuckerman and his company, Boston Properties, should go ahead with the development deal they agreed to -- or else forfeit their $33.8 million letter of credit. That would free the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the property, to seek other developers, who might submit more imaginative proposals and, most importantly, offer a
