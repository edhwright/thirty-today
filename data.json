Excerpts appear with each article.   WUBNESH HYLTON , 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): Working is not, like, a luxury; it's a necessity. Just like for a college student, you know, going to school only is not reality. You have to work and go to school. That's just the way it is. I pay my rent. I pay my bills, you know. Every once in a while I'm afforded a little luxury, you know, but it's pretty straight-laced.   BERNARDO VASQUEZ , 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): I have responsibilities. Like, my father is a superintendent.  I have to clean the building and stuff like that.  I have to take care of my sisters once in a while. And in the case of the work ethic in the sense of ---- I might not like doing this job.  But I'd better do it well, so I'd better start liking it. Because my father is going to come along and check the corners to see if they're clean. So I'd better start liking it.   WUBNESH I enjoy my work. I just wish it paid more. . . . I don't know if I'll keep with it.  . . . It pays the bills, but it doesn't allow you to have any fun and put something in the bank, too.   JUAN RIVERA , 18, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): The thing about it is, is on the job, as far as it getting boring for me. And I might move on or something.    WUBNESH There are no jobs. I think young people want money. And a lot of young people are willing to work for it. But, again, young people want glamorous jobs. They want to work in the Gap. They don't want to work in McDonald's.   JUAN The other reason that a lot of young people don't go out and get jobs is that they don't know how to represent themselves. They might go in with these jeans, you know, untied shoes. . . . And they might not know what to say. They come in, like, \"What's up?\" you know? And they don't know how to represent themselves or something like that in an interview.    WUBNESH When you're younger, identity is something that you have to show. When you get older, identity becomes a part of you, and no matter what you wear, you know who you are. So, when you get older, you put aside your ego with that Champion sweat shirt or whatever.  And you get done with a T-shirt. You know, a suit and stuff. It's not such a big deal anymore.   EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER , 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): Role models really help. I think that might be the most important thing.  If you see somebody who you can relate to, who has gotten somewhere, you know you can get somewhere.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930422","headline":"Parcells Isn't Telling the No. 1 Secret","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/sports/pro-football-parcells-isn-t-telling-the-no-1-secret.html","abstract":"  Coach Bill Parcells emerged from his self-described bunker today, brandishing the top pick in the National Football League draft and, as usual, playing it coy.

Even better, the earnings boost for individuals gets bigger over time -- inviting hope that small change might eventually yield large gains.   California's welfare program mirrors the Family Support Act, a 1988 Federal reform, and incorporates President Clinton's call for reciprocal obligation. Welfare parents continue to get benefits, but in exchange agree to participate in programs designed to get them into steady jobs. The California plan places welfare recipients in literacy, schooling, job-search and training programs. It provides transportation and child care while recipients enroll in the program, and continues child care for a year after they locate jobs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930422","headline":"DEATH IN WACO: Washington Memo; A Strategy of Openness Aims to Avert Backlash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/us/death-in-waco-washington-memo-a-strategy-of-openness-aims-to-avert-backlash.html","abstract":"  Hoping to win public understanding for its tear gas assault on the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Tex., senior officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation held an unusually elaborate three-hour briefing with reporters today to describe the reasoning behind their attack.

One of the masters of both forms of conflict was Christoph Willibald Gluck, whose 1779 opera \"Iphigenie en Tauride\" was performed on Wednesday night at the Manhattan School of Music. This production, directed by James Robinson, also yearns to take a role in contemporary debates about operatic presentation, though it does so with far less coherence than did Gluck.    Gluck's impact on the evolution of opera was immense, and he made the issues clear from the very beginning of this elegantly dramatic work. He was opposed to the Italian style in which florid display of a singer's abilities could become an ornament to mythic tales. He wished, in his words, to \"restrict music to its true office of serving poetry by means of expression.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930423","headline":"Editors' Note","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/nyregion/editors-note-392093.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Tuesday, and in some editions on Monday, reported the death of South Dakota's Governor, George S.

Ms. Mehren, an East Coast correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, and her husband, Fox Butterfield, a correspondent for The New York Times, are played with quiet but tough honesty by Pamela Reed and Michael Moriarty. The story begins with Elizabeth, less than six months pregnant, making an ordinary business trip to Los Angeles. On the plane back to New York, her water breaks. Why?

In a move that seems to defy logic, the producers said they would decline    any    nomination that implied \"Fool Moon\" -- a wordless series of clown skits performed by David Shiner and Bill Irwin, accompanied by the string-band music of the Red Clay Ramblers -- is a play.    Not that anyone thinks it's a musical. What the producers (and the performers) want is special dispensation -- either the creation of a new category or a special Tony -- that would make a distinction between the theatrical qualities of \"Fool Moon\" and those of a conventional play or musical.

All the details were there: the fresh, bright room with faux terrazzo tile floors, the blue vinyl booths and Formica tables, the counter and soda fountain and the menu, heavy on breakfast and Middle American diner fare. Only one problem: the food also seemed to have been designed by Martians from a distance. It was great to look at but utterly tasteless.   Now, several visits to E. J.'s make one thing clear: the Martians have learned to cook.   This improvement is not surprising, since E. J.'s is associated with the partners who own the two Docks Oyster Bars, the three Ollie's Noodle Shops and the two Carmine's, all popular and successful restaurants in Manhattan. The E.

Italian elections have mostly been based on proportional representation, a system that guarantees minority parties legislative seats in proportion to their popular vote. By contrast, other nations use a system in which the winner takes all, meaning those who finish second and third in a race for Congress or Parliament are just out of luck and office.    Proportional representation sounds like the ultimate in democracy -- no voice too small to be heard. But its great defect is that it can spawn too many splinter parties. It tends also to create a permanent class of power brokers, since national parties choose lists of candidates and winners owe nothing to their constituency, providing less accountability than in other systems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930424","headline":"Don't Teach Nature About Barrier Beaches","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/24/opinion/l-don-t-teach-nature-about-barrier-beaches-315893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   You report that a New York State task force on coastal erosion has recommended quick restoration at public expense of major Long Island beaches damaged in last winter's storms (April 14 article).

The world is horrified by the scenes of helpless refugees and the evidence of mass killings and forced expulsions.  As frustration mounts in America and elsewhere, President Clinton is reviewing his policy and is under intense pressure -- even from State Department officers -- to take other steps, including military strikes. While it is important to keep military choices under review, we need a clear idea where they lead and what they will accomplish.    The Administration has correctly ruled out unilateral deployment of U.S. ground forces. Such action has little public support. Because we can't resolve the crisis alone, we have been committed to a multinational approach. But action on that front has been slow and halting. Today, we would not be able to obtain U.N.
