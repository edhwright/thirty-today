The first exhibition to bask in the one-third-larger, more open, light-infused two-story space is that of the basket maker Hisako Sekijima. \n\nMs. Sekijima's distinction is in cherishing open space as much as the forms she creates to extol it. She starts from the inside, conjuring a vacuum, then creating a basket-sculpture to surround it. The artist, who was born in Japan, has lived in the United States and France as well, and she has studied contemporary basket making, American Indian basketry and splint basketry. \n\nHer works have been exhibited at the American Craft Museum, the California Craft Museum and Hokkaido-Asahikawa Museum. They are part of the permanent collections of the Erie Art Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Hawaii State Foundation for Culture and Art.\n\nShe is also the author of books on basket making including \"Basketry: Projects From Baskets to Grass Slippers\" (Kodansha International Ltd., Japan) and presents workshops and lectures throughout the United States and Japan.\n\nHer constructions are woven of natural materials -- bamboo, wisteria, kudzu vine, mulberry and willow bark. In what the artist considers a collaboration with nature, Ms. Sekijima said, \"I let my materials do the talking.\"\n\nThe exhibition, on view through July 17 at the six-year-old gallery owned by Rhonda Brown and Tom Grotta, exudes a feeling of spatial containment common in Japanese sculpture and related to Zen concepts.\n\nIn balancing material and space, form and volume, Ms. Sekijima thinks of space as a negative as opposed to the positive of tangible materials like vine, sticks or bark.\n\nIn her view, the part that the materials fill has a value equal to that where they do not exist, as in the relation of positive and negative. The result, said Janet Kopolos, senior editor of \"Art in America\" and author of \"Contemporary Japanese Sculpture\" (Abbeville Press, New York City), is work that \"cannot be physically or conceptually distinguished from sculpture.\"\n\nEach of the 12 pieces in the exhibition, which took a year to prepare, has its own distinctive identity. \"We had seen her work, but not two that were similar, when Jack Lenor Larsen, the textile designer, author and great cheerleader for crafts, came to dinner,\" Mr. Grotta said. \"We asked him who he thought belonged in our gallery. She was the No. 1 artist recommended.\"\n\nBecause each piece is a distinct form, as if made by a different artist, each invites study and the search for a common thread. The pieces are grouped in a living-room setting, on long low tables backing two black leather sofas. One, an airy cylindrical form that resembles a maze of tree branches, \"is the favorite basket of almost everyone who walks in,\" Mr. Grotta said. \"Its strength lies in the infinite knots made of kudzu vine that give it shape, structure and stability. People are drawn to it for its airy quality and puzzle-like maze of knots.\"\n\nAlthough there are always spaces to be found in Ms. Sekijima's work, one piece called \"Fittings,\" made of cherry bark fastened by knots of maple splint, is more substantial and looks like ceramic. Her use of knots here led to another exploration and to a piece using randomly interlaced bamboo in what became inner and outer bowl-shape baskets. Fitted ever so casually together, they emphasize angles as well as space.\n\nA coiled sphere, pleated of walnut bark with the texture of leather, has openings large enough to poke a finger through.\n\nMr. Grotta suggested that a piece shaped like an envelope was more traditional and in the Japanese esthetic. The sculpture is made of willow wood and bark, is folded and simply but strikingly stitched and has Henry Moore-like openings that invite viewers. \n\nOther pieces include a wreath-shape bowl of highly textured, light berry shavings wrapped and stitched in contrasting dark willow as well as a wall piece of six square panels hung together to form a rectangular form. \nWhite Oak and Coralberry Root\n\n Although the baskets of the current exhibition are displayed in the living room, viewers are treated to an art-infused home with works from top weavers and basket makers from the moment they step over the threshold. \n\nAt the entrance, for example, is a bassinet of white oak and coralberry root by Sharon and Leon Niehues, woven for but now outgrown by the owners' 1-year-old son, Carter. In the youngster's room there are wall hangings, mobiles and sculptured basket works that seem fit for a future connoisseur. \n\n\"Basket making over the last 10 years has made a transition from traditional and functional to the creation of contemporary baskets as an art form,\" Rhonda Brown said. \"And Ms. Sekijima's work with the use of traditional material and traditional techniques but nontraditional structures makes that clear.\"\n\nThe Brown/Grotta Gallery (39 Grumman Hill Road, Wilton; 834-0623) is open by appointment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"A Drive for Court Interpreters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/a-drive-for-court-interpreters.html","abstract":"AN assault trial was in its second day in District Court in Suffolk County in Islip when the defendant whispered to his lawyer that the Spanish interpreter was consistently misinterpreting important phrases.\n\nThe lawyer, Sherry Lee Speal of Babylon, told the judge, Ralph F.

Yet, she concluded, \"no one is going to go and see a film about politics.\"   Her approach, then, was to look for the man behind Thomas Jefferson the Great American. And, in that sense, she was lucky. The years that Jefferson spent in Paris as President Washington's Ambassador, 1784 to 1789, provided a rare window to the hidden passions of this introspective man.

With a cast of more than 50 performers playing against the magnificent backdrop of the Hudson River and the Jersey skyline, \"Stonewall: Night Variations\" celebrates both a birthday and a battle. The occasion: the 25th anniversary of the Greenwich Village riots that are now accepted as the start of the gay liberation movement.   It was on the night of June 27, 1969, that a routine police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a Christopher Street hangout for homosexuals, run by the Mafia, prompted not cowed obedience from the customers but uncharacteristic fury and outrage. Just why is anybody's guess now. Some say it was the heat of the night. Others say it had something to do with the death of Judy Garland five days before in London. Whatever the reason, patience had run out. Bricks and bottles were thrown. In the aftermath of the melee, gays and lesbians left closets, never to return.

It has created more stylistic names during the last decade than art music has in a century.   We don't really know how to compare these cultures. Every so often someone tries to argue that they are equivalent -- that, say, the contemporary popularity of Madonna and the 19th-century acclaim for Verdi are aspects of the same phenomenon -- but these assertions make everybody uneasy.

The Court therefore has an obligation to follow the wisdom of the founders, who saw clearly that state-imposed limits that would apply unevenly to representatives and senators depending on where they lived would foul up the Constitution's design of a national union.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Newport","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/travel/what-s-doing-in-newport.html","abstract":"  In Newport, R.I., there is a sophistication found in few other American cities of its size.

IDENTITY: Actor; brother of the actresses Rosanna and Patricia Arquette. AGE: 24. RECENT STAGE PROJECT: Just finished playing Lee Harvey Oswald in the Steppenwolf Theater's production in Chicago of \"Libra,\" directed by John Malkovich. CURRENT MOVIE ROLES: Jack in \"Jack Be Nimble,\" a Gothic horror film from New Zealand, and Bill in \"Grief,\" a film about the writers on a cheesy television show. Q.  How did you approach playing Oswald? A.  When most people play a villain, they play him as bad. They forget that people who do bad things don't see themselves that way. I imagined him as someone who was manipulated, who had a story to tell and never got to tell it. I played him like an Everyman. Q. How did the cast react to the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis? A.  Our show has a lot of technical aspects to it. We show the Zapruder film. The night she died, for the first time, we had technical difficulties. Even the mice in cages backstage got loose, and no one could explain why. There was talk of our being haunted.   Q.  Tell me about the character you play in \"Pulp Fiction,\" which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. A.  I haven't seen it yet, so it depends what wasn't left on the cutting room floor. He's a drug underling who is supposed to make the two hit men doubt their passion for killing. Q.  The 1990 movie \"Last Exit to Brooklyn\" was your big break, right?  A.  It was my first acting job really. My sister Patricia was asked to play the Jennifer Jason Leigh role, but she was pregnant. She went to New York to tell them no in person. She said, \"Lexy, come with me.\" The next thing I knew my sister's agent was telling me that they wanted me to play Georgette. I thought they were just using me to get Patricia to take the role. Q.  Had you ever done drag before? A.  Only in a sophomoric way on Halloween. I began researching by going to drag clubs. Though the movie is set in the 50's, I figured things were the same. I befriended these performers who were flamboyant and talented, yes, but they weren't Georgette. She was an addict. She didn't dress to be glamorous. She was a subversive beatnik. Q.  Since then you've created other drag characters, like Eva Destruction, which you perform at clubs. Are you worried about being known as \"that actor who does drag\"? A.  I'm not a career drag queen. I certainly don't make money out of it. Now I mostly do it for benefits. People try to trivialize it, and say it's just drag. Mike Myers as Linda Richman and Dana Carvey as Church Lady have become famous with their drag roles.  Q.  Would you ever dress up as one of your sisters? A.  Patricia was meant to judge a fashion show at a club in L.A. She couldn't make it. I threw together an outfit that was identical to her costume in \"True Romance.\" We simply introduced me as Patricia Arquette to the audience. I came over later and showed her. Q.  I hear you were upset that Patrick Swayze got the role you wanted in \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,\" the road movie about three drag queens that Steven Spielberg is producing. A.  Patrick Swayze's far too old and far too straight in my opinion. It's fine if straight actors want to play gay roles because I'm a gay actor who also wants to play straight roles. Of course, Tom Hanks was great in \"Philadelphia.\" But I do have a problem that three drag queens are being played by three straight actors. It makes me want to run away and do films in Turkey or India. Q.  Is that why you went to New Zealand to make \"Jack Be Nimble\"? A.  When I read the script, I was just stricken by the beauty of it and the kitsch black humor. It's my favorite work to date. It's like all the movies I love, like \"Carrie\" and \"The Exorcist\" and \"Eating Raoul.\"  Q.  What's next for you? A.  The only thing I know I'm doing for sure is a film called \"Forget-Me-Nots,\" with John Malkovich, which is going to be another one that gay groups won't like. It's about an unstable man who kills his lover after learning that his lover is H.I.V. positive and hasn't told him. I'm going to be a character that John uses as an alibi.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Checking Up on Manny at Midseason","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-washington-heights-local-hero-update-checking-up-manny.html","abstract":"  Out on the ball fields of Washington Heights, the buzz is still about Manny (Ramirez, that is, the Cleveland Indians' rookie right fielder and the pride of Washington Heights).

Toxic lead is a case in point, although there are more than 200 pollutants in mass-burn incinerator ash. Lead could go undetected, because it is a minuscule portion of \"bottom ash,\" which is 90 percent of all incinerator ash. For all five Long Island incinerators bottom ash probably will be about 784 million pounds annually and contain over two million pounds of toxic lead. Even if scientists can't measure this portion of lead, does that make two million pounds of lead safe for human consumption annually?

Few campaigns have dared to delete the Eastern Parkway headquarters of the world Lubavitch movement and its Rebbe, as he was known, from their itinerary.   An analysis of election returns challenges the totem that members of the Hasidic sect in Crown Heights reflexively vote as an organized bloc in every election. But the analysis suggests that while they account for fewer voters than some other Hasidic sects and their concerns about Israel may weigh more heavily in their political calculations, when they are galvanized by an issue or a candidate, members of the Lubavitch movement, like those of many other groups, can be monolithic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Less Stress From a Day In the Courts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/less-stress-from-a-day-in-the-courts.html","abstract":"  Hya Jones was simmering with frustration.

This is an important show, and a timely one. Organized by Elizabeth A. T. Smith, a curator at the museum, in consultation with a distinguished group of advisers, \"Urban Revisions\" is the most important contribution yet offered by a major cultural institution to an urgent cultural task: the moral reconstruction of architecture in the aftermath of the 1980's building boom. Departing courageously from the familiar art museum preoccupation with visual form, the show sets out to grapple with content -- the social, intellectual and political ideas from which forms arise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Day's Biggest Surprise?

The decision to race Twining was made by Helen Alexander of the King Ranch, who owns the colt with Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai. It was apparently made against the objections of the trainer, Scotty Schulhofer, who for weeks has been saying with finality that Twining needed more seasoning before daring to match speed with the swift, imposing gray colt who has won eight of his 10 races, most often leading every step of the way.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Rebels Have Little to Show for Efforts to Topple Saddam Hussein","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/world/rebels-have-little-to-show-for-efforts-to-topple-saddam-hussein.html","abstract":"  In a small, nondescript house, with armed guards out front and the windows bricked shut, the men and women who would seize power from President Saddam Hussein plot their way to Baghdad.

The most lionized woman writer of the 19th century was, of course, also a famous femme fatale, as notorious for her affairs with Alfred de Musset, Frederic Chopin and many less accomplished men as for the dozens of freewheeling and intellectual novels, plays and essays she wrote. There is no better way to glimpse just how fatale a femme she was than to visit the exquisitely frivolous and irresistibly named museum devoted to her jewels, furniture and family portraits: Le Musee de la Vie Romantique, the Museum of Romantic Life. One of the newest museums in Paris -- just a dozen years old -- it is one of the city's most charming and eccentric secrets.   The modest, shuttered three-story house and separate painter's studio are set in a courtyard on the Rue Chaptal, a tiny side street on the fringe of Montmartre. A five-minute walk will lead to one of the most garish parts of the city, where the Moulin Rouge stands guard over sex shops and seedy characters. Another 10 minutes and you will be at Sacre-Coeur, which seems dangerously like a cathedral to tourism. Le Musee de la Vie Romantique ignores all that; it calmly and deliberately lets the present slip away. Unfashionably cluttered -- with patterned wallpaper and vitrines crammed with baubles -- it conveys the ornate texture of 19th-century artistic life, when everyone who had ever held a pen or paintbrush also knew how to hold a salon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Paper's Small But Issues Are Life-Size","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-brownsville-paper-s-small-but-issues-are-life-size.html","abstract":"  Ginnie Rumore is a school nurse, but she also considers herself something of a cub reporter.

However, a more serious argument seems to me to be ignored. It is that the position of, for example, the National Rifle Association and its supporters, wittingly or not, serves to legitimate the anarchy of American society -- and this in the name of law and order.   It is hardly original to say that the use of civil procedures for the orderly resolution of disputes has distinguished domestic political life from the anarchy of an international order of sovereign units. In a real sense, the 20th century has been distinguished by the only modestly successful attempts to have states substitute collective security arrangements and collectively established procedures for the anarchic tradition of self-help.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"BROOKLYN UPDATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/brooklyn-update.html","abstract":"  * CLINTON HILL: In a reversal, Pratt Institute has agreed to renew its lease with the Benjamin Banneker Academy for Community Development, one of the city's new experimental high schools.

Mr. Plowden himself grew up in such a town -- Putney, Vt. -- during the 1940's, and has set himself the mission of documenting the few remaining examples of the culture that evoke his youth: barbershops, general stores, gas pumps, clapboard houses, main streets, hardware stores, quiet bars and whimsical meeting halls. The book's straightforward black-and-white photographs are the result of Mr. Plowden's travels on the country's roads, setting to work with his camera and tripod in backwaters where CVS pharmacies, Wal-Marts and Toyota dealers have not yet reached. Like an archeologist, Mr. Plowden seems to be engaged in a treasure hunt, uncovering and recording what he calls \"once commonplace things\" that provide clues to life in another time and place. Pleasure in the genuine article underlies all his images, from handmade doors and homely interiors to the faces of small-town folk who, as he makes clear in his text, represent a rugged individuality that has all but disappeared. The last photograph, taken in Mayetta, Kan., neatly summarizes Mr. Plowden's sense of loss. The glorious steam locomotive of the past has been reduced to a painting on a brick wall, advertising antiques and used furniture. Beyond it an abandoned building sits on the far side of the empty street, and in the foreground weeds push through cracks in the neglected pavement.

By the time the $7 million, three-story brick building was dedicated in 1989, scientists knew a raccoon rabies epidemic was heading straight for the state, but it was expected to take a few more years to arrive.   Today the pathobiologists working at the complex are at the center of tracking the spread of rabies across the state. Last month nearly 100 animals -- taken to the center by animal control officers, conservation officers and worried residents -- tested positive for the disease. Summer is a dangerous time of the year for the spread of rabies for several reasons, said Dr. Louis van der Heide, head of pathobiology at UConn. With warmer weather people are outside and more likely to come in contact with wild animals. In addition, if a mother raccoon dies of rabies people might find the babies and take them home, risking bites, Dr. van der Heide said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Habitats/Bleeker Street Studio; Breaking All the Rules","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/realestate/habitats-bleeker-street-studio-breaking-all-the-rules.html","abstract":"  IT was a very unusual deal.

Such flim-flam is hard to avoid in municipal contracting, especially in affirmative-action programs. The reason is basic: money and politics are involved.

The concept was usually a good deal more interesting than the execution. But Nayo Takasaki's new \"Urban Planning I,\" presented on Saturday night by Nayo and Friends at the Merce Cunningham Studio, was the real thing. For a little more than the first half of this hourlong piece, Miss Takasaki offered viewers on two sides of the large studio stage a continuously changing -- and fascinating -- exploration of shapes and the space around them.    Even a single body at ease in an empty space can suggest much. The surprise of \"Urban Planning I\" was how suggestive five large, inherently inanimate objects could be. Moved about the floor by five quick-stepping dancers, five plain gray foam rectangles, standing on end at first, then lengthwise, created a changing landscape of buildings, city plazas, small bustling streets and homes. The dancers were not always visible, but that made the illusion even richer. And their interaction with the rectangles seldom overtly suggested dramatic situations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940704","headline":"Collies Work Hard and Then Chat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/04/books/books-of-the-times-collies-work-hard-and-then-chat.html","abstract":"  Nop's Hope  By Donald McCaig  230 pages.

On his portrayal by the press:    \"I think there is a tendency to play to stereotype. So that nobody thinks that I'm paranoid, it cuts in either direction: I think that, you know, if the prior Mayor played tennis, that was exaggerated and made a great deal of. If somebody thinks that I've gotten angry, that's going to be exaggerated.\" On what the press plays up:    \"Even if I were to be angry, which, you know, happens: the President's gotten angry, Mayor Dinkins got angry sometimes. If I got angry, that would be a much bigger event and would be played up much more than if somebody else got angry.\"  On getting his message across:    \"Sometimes you do deliberately plan to get your message out. Usually those are things you plan in advance and you work very hard to get your message out. . . . Now the press might regard that as manipulation; that's part of communicating. As much as you can, you want to frame the debate. In fact, the greatest success you can have, is not so much determining all the answers, but at least framing the debate: Get the questions asked in the right way.\"  On whether the press is fair:    \"When they interpret it in the way in which I believe I communicated, I think they did it fairly.

Some seem sullen and fitful, and others, like the tribute to the Rev. John Garcia Gensel on Friday night at Carnegie Hall, take on a sense of euphoria. Mr. Gensel, who retired this year after decades of work as \"the pastor to the jazz community,\" as the program described him, has presided over births and deaths, offered advice and helped with whatever afflictions his parishioners have brought him. He was in the audience, and the trumpeter Jimmy Owens, capturing the mood of the celebration, put it well: \"Usually the person in a tribute is dead. We're glad you're here to smell the flowers.\"   It also helped that the show, produced by the critic Ira Gitler, was put together so well. Instrumental combinations changed onstage with no loss of momentum or inspiration, and the musicians, barely amplified, made the music sound fine, a rare thing in Carnegie Hall. By the time the show was over, with Bill Cosby, the master of ceremonies, intoning over the loudspeaker system as if he were God, the audience had heard a trombone duet, three trumpets, bop musicians playing with swing musicians, a three-saxophone face-off, lots of jokes about death, and some gentle and lovely music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940704","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/04/nyregion/chronicle-580090.html","abstract":"  On neutral ground, away from the home district of either the bride or the groom, two members of New York's Congressional delegation were married yesterday.

rhythm-and-blues-based music than Booker T. & the MG's and the Fugees (Tranzlator Crew), both of which performed on Saturday afternoon at the Central Park Summerstage. Booker T. & the MG's, the Stax Records house band that performed behind Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and other soul greats while recording distinctive instrumental songs of their own, make music built on disciplined, understated playing and thrifty, gentle grooves. The Fugees, a hip-hop band featuring two Haitian men and one American woman, structure their sound from festive, shambling raps and loose, rambunctious grooves. Both bands, however, concoct inventive and immediate music that is neither too strict nor too indulgent.   Booker T. & the MG's set list was as orderly as their performing style. Throughout the hour-plus show, they alternated a song from their new album, \"That's the Way It Should Be\" (Columbia), the band's first record in 17 years, with an older song. They opened the set with their recent, languid reworking of Bob Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" -- perhaps the only low point on the band's wonderfully spartan new album besides their cover of U2's \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" -- before moving on to the older, stronger \"Melting Pot.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940705","headline":"How Nature Makes a Butterfly's Wing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/science/how-nature-makes-a-butterfly-s-wing.html","abstract":"  THE spray of colors on a butterfly's wing, a vivid pattern painted with the iridescent dust of thousands of tiny scales, ranks among nature's more entrancing mysteries. Though some like to keep wonders inviolate, others find a greater pleasure in understanding the elegant genetic machinery by which such beauty and diversity are generated. For the latter, an article in the current issue of Science goes a long way toward explaining the miracle of how a butterfly's wing is made.   A team of biologists at the University of Wisconsin in Madison has traced out how a handful of genes become activated in the embryonic wing disks that are secretly budding while the butterfly is still a lumbering caterpillar. The genes produce substances that mark the position of each cell in the future wing with almost the precision of defining squares on a piece of graph paper.  Once the coordinates are fixed, another crew of genes sketches out the dance of eyespots, chevrons, bands and dashes that make up butterfly wing patterns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940705","headline":"New Images Support Planets of Other Stars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/science/new-images-support-planets-of-other-stars.html","abstract":"  MORE possible evidence for the existence of planets around stars other than the Sun has been detected by French astronomers examining new infrared pictures of the disk of dusty particles orbiting the star Beta Pictoris, about 52 light-years away.
