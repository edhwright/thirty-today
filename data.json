Massenet's setting invites spectacle on both the visual and the vocal scale. The Opera Theater of St. Louis has responded by avoiding the first and embracing the second.   Using a bare brick wall as background and a stage that reaches into the small audience space, Neil Peter Jampolis's design creates spectacle by inference. Portraits are hung and sconces attached. Lighting projections designed by Christopher Akerlind imply grand staircases, towering ballroom spaces or leafy arbors. Such parsimony is turned to musical advantage, directing our attention to the displays of singing on which the opera's uneven virtues ultimately depend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Ferreting Out False Claims For Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/nyregion/ferreting-out-false-claims-for-welfare.html","abstract":"  When Vanessa F. needed money for the security deposit on a new apartment, she thought she had a foolproof solution: welfare fraud.   \"I thought it would be pretty easy to do,\" Vanessa said. \"A lot of people do it by going to the different towns and giving different addresses.

Over the last several months they have reached a rough consensus that the vast plates that comprise the ocean floor sink deep into the earth's mantle, only to be recycled into giant ascending plumes of hot rock. The plumes, driven, some believe, by heat from the earth's core, emerge to form strings of oceanic islands like the Hawaiian chain or to blanket continents with huge sheets of lava.   The discoveries, said Dr. Michael E. Wysession, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who is an authority on the earth's interior, constitute \"a second revolution,\" comparable in scientific terms to the theory of plate tectonics, which, when it came to be accepted three decades ago, showed that the continents had been in constant motion over the course of geological time, carried along by great plates.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Bridge Toll Divides City Of New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/nyregion/bridge-toll-divides-city-of-new-york.html","abstract":"  A seemingly simple dispute over tolls on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has pitted Staten Island against the rest of the city, and is likely to be decided by Congress.

Twenty years later, Mr. Pogorelich made headlines when his elimination before the final round caused a ruckus among the jurors. Mr. Pogorelich ended up far better known than that year's winner, the Vietnamese pianist Dang Thai Son.    Mr. Pollini and Mr. Pogorelich are about to have something else in common: both are involved with new piano competitions, and both are hoping, against the odds, that they can identify pianists who will stand out in the already overcrowded field of contest winners.

It was precisely the wrong target; women, children and civilian demonstrators are not the enemies in Mogadishu. The Pakistanis' grievous error handed a propaganda windfall to the Mogadishu warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid.    It would compound the tragedy if General Aidid, the culprit responsible for so much suffering in Somalia, is able to portray himself as a victim. President Clinton was justified in sending more warplanes to Somalia in support of the 20-nation peacemaking effort. But yesterday's accidental strike at a civilian target by a Cobra gunship shows the need for greater care in

Composed in the mid-1890's and first performed in 1902, \"Pelleas\" has always occupied a place in the operatic pantheon, albeit a side niche. But of late new productions have popped up nearly everywhere, notably in Chicago and Seattle in the United States.
