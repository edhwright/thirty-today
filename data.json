(3) The United States and its allies should threaten force by sending weapons \"to the Bosnian Muslims, the Croatians and perhaps the Albanians,\" confronting Serbia with a multifront war.   There is a grave problem with touting ethnic homogeneity as a basis of legitimacy in the Balkans: how do we keep the idea of ethnic homogeneity out of places where we don't want it (like the United States)? Once ethnic homogeneity is accepted as a principle, it provides the catalyst for many dormant ethnic problems to become active and violent.

Accordion Makes Three    Nancy Marano and Eddie Monteiro, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2272). After building a devoted following during eight years of playing one-night stands in clubs in northern New Jersey, Westchester County and, more recently, New York City, Nancy Marano and Eddie Monteiro have finally achieved an extended engagement at a major club, Michael's Pub. Ms. Marano, a songwriter and arranger, plays piano and sings, while Mr. Monteiro uses a unique accordion that houses a miniaturized organ with synthesizer effects as well as a microphone that projects his vocalizing, with its crisply popped scat syllables and lazy hums. The duo is today's equivalent of innovative jazz vocal groups like the Boswell Sisters in the 1930's and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross in the 1950's. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9:15 and 11:15 P.M. There is a $20 cover charge and a $15 minimum. Jimmy Smith and Equals    Jimmy Smith Trio, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. Jimmy Smith, who gave the Hammond organ validity as a jazz instrument in the late 1950's, is making one of his infrequent visits to New York from his home in California to lead a trio with musicians who are his equals on their own instruments: the guitarist Kenny Burrell and the drummer Grady Tate. They last appeared together at Fat Tuesday's in 1991. Now in his mid-60's, Mr. Smith still plays jazz-funk with an energy that leaves both his audiences and his sidemen exhausted. They go on tonight and tomorrow at 8 and 10 P.M. and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a cover charge of $20 and a $10 minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"Worthy Versions Of 'The Ring': A Critical Selection; Clemens Krauss","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/arts/worthy-versions-of-the-ring-a-critical-selection-clemens-krauss.html","abstract":"  The idea of a \"best\" as applied to so sprawling and diverse an assortment of music as Wagner's \"Ring\" may seem illusory, so I will proceed to proclaim the 1953 Bayreuth Festival \"Ring\" conducted by Clemens Krauss (Foyer 2011; 15 CD's) the best on records.   Although it is now 40 years old, and it appeared publicly long after Georg Solti's pioneering studio-recorded \"Ring\" on Decca/London, this set is actually a better documentation of the extraordinary post-World War II Bayreuth ensemble. True, Mr. Solti had Birgit Nilsson as Brunnhilde.

Something profound in the American spirit fuels a fierce resentment against governmental exactions and the process required to comply with them. Now that most of us have mailed off our 1040's, here, in the spirit of shared experience, are some American quotations -- both negative and (occasionally) positive -- about taxation.\n\nThe power to tax involves the power to destroy.\n\nJohn Marshall, McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819.\n\nOf all debts men are least willing to pay the taxes. What a satire is this on government!\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, \"Politics,\" 1844.\n\nThe income tax is just. It simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the backs of the people. I am in favor of an income tax. When I find a man who is not willing to bear his share of the burdens of the government which protects him, I find a man who is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a government like ours.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, speech at Democratic National Convention, Chicago, July 8, 1896.\n\nWhat is the difference between a taxidermist and a tax collector? The taxidermist takes only your skin.\n\nMark Twain, \"Notebooks,\" Dec. 30, 1902.\n\nallegiance, \n\nn. \n\nthe traditional bond of duty between the taxer and the taxee. It is not reversible.\n\nAmbrose Bierce, \"The Enlarged Devil's Dictionary,\" 1967.\n\nThe Income Tax has made more Liars out of the American people than Golf has. Even when you make one out on the level, you don't know when it's through if you are a Crook or a Martyr.\n\nWill Rogers, \"The Illiterate Digest,\" 1924.\n\nTaxes are what we pay for civilized society.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas v. Collector of Internal Revenue, 1927.\n\nThe power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 1928. \n\nAnyone may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose the pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes.\n\nLearned Hand, Helvering v. Gregory, 1934.\n\nOne sure way to determine the social conscience of a Government is to examine the way taxes are collected and how they are spent. And one sure way to determine the social conscience of an individual is to get his tax-reaction. Taxes, after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, campaign address, Worcester, Mass., Oct. 21, 1936.\n\nDeath and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them!\n\nMargaret Mitchell, \"Gone With the Wind,\" 1936.\n\nWhy shouldn't the American people take half my money from me? I took all of it from them.\n\nEdward A. Filene, owner of Filene's department store, quoted by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in \"The Coming of the New Deal,\" 1959.\n\nDear Mr. President, Internal Revenue regulations will turn us into a nation of bookkeepers. The life of every citizen is becoming a business. This, it seems to me, is one of the worst interpretations of the meaning of human life history has ever seen. Man's life is not a business.\n\nSaul Bellow, \"Herzog,\" 1964.\n\n[\nThe U.S. should\n]\n have a tax system which looks like someone designed it on purpose.\n\nWilliam E. Simon, quoted in \"Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform,\" 1977.\n\nThe American taxing structure, the purpose of which was to serve the people, began instead to serve the insatiable appetite of government. If you will forgive me, you know someone has once likened government to a baby. It is an alimentary canal with an appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.\n\nRonald Reagan, remarks before a joint session of Parliament, Ottawa, March 11, 1981.\n\nWe don't pay taxes.

Rejoining his friends on a stoop across the street, he lifts the fat bottle trumpet-like to his lips and gulps down the brew in loud, foamy swallows.   \"It gets you nice,\" he says, passing the bottle to an eager friend.    \"It gets you pumped up,\" adds the next boy. \"I feel more comfortable when I'm drinking a 40.\"   Malt liquor -- essentially beer brewed with sugar for an extra alcoholic kick -- has long been popular with black and Hispanic drinkers. But in the outsize 40-ounce bottle, introduced in the late 1980's with aggressive marketing campaigns aimed at minority drinkers, it is fast becoming the intoxicant of choice for black and Hispanic youths in New York and other American cities.    Some teen-agers call malt liquor \"liquid crack\" in tribute to its potency. And to the dismay of drug counselors, social workers and ministers who see malt liquor as a dangerous drug in sheep's clothing, the 40-ounce bottles with brand names like King Cobra, Crazy Horse, Colt 45 and St. Ides have become an accessory to the youth-culture ensemble of baggy clothes, expensive work boots and street-hardened attitudes. \"Tap the Bottle,\" a new song celebrating the consumption of 40-ounce malt liquor, has become a hit on the rap charts.   The essence of the 40 is its combination of size, power and price. At between $1.25 and $2.50, essentially the same as a quart bottle, and with an alcohol content of 5.6 to 8 percent, compared with 3.5 percent for regular beer, the 40-ounce malt liquor offers more punch for the money.   The brewing companies -- which have long been criticized for marketing campaigns that target minority communities -- argue that in selling and promoting the 40-ounce malt liquors, they are simply trying to maintain what has always been a crucial market. But to a chorus of critics, the creation and targeted marketing of the 40 is a cynical attempt to take advantage of poor youngsters in search of a cheap high. The results, they say, can be dangerous and occasionally disastrous, not least because of a misimpression that malt liquor is a relatively harmless pleasure.    \"They are becoming alcoholics and don't even know it,\" said Eric Brent, a recovering cocaine addict who is the founder of Rescue, an anti-addiction program in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. \"Denial is such a monster in their lives.\"   The precise dimensions of the phenomenon are unknowable. But industry analysts say that in the last few years, malt liquor has become the fastest-growing segment of the beer market. And drug counselors and health officials say that while they know of no studies of malt-liquor consumption by young people in the inner city, they see signs of increasing underage drinking linked to the availability of the large bottles.  Seen as Alternative to Drugs    The popularity of the 40's comes as drug-treatment experts and the police are reporting modest drops in teen-age drug use. Some teen-agers in poor neighborhoods now see malt liquor as an alternative to drugs, according to Makani Thaemba, a public policy specialist for the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in San Rafael, Calif.   At the same time, some substance abuse authorities say they have been seeing growing numbers of young people seeking treatment for twin addictions. Increasingly, one of the substances is alcohol, many say, and often that alcohol came by way of malt liquor sold in a 40-ounce bottle.   Some say, too, that they have noticed a growing association between drinking 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor and smoking marijuana. The combination, one teen-ager said, goes together like \"cookies and milk.\"   The Bronx teen-ager who bought the Olde English 800 returned to the grocery store minutes later to purchase a 35-cent Philly Blunt cigar and, as street fad dictates, he hollowed it out and packed it with marijuana to smoke with the malt liquor. Hoisting a 40 for Breakfast    Drinking a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor for breakfast en route to school is not unusual, said a Bronx teen-ager who said he used to do just that. Guzzling 40 ounces to intoxication, others added, is a major attraction at \"hooky parties.\"   \"It is just a thing we did,\" said Clifton W., a 16-year-old Bronx boy who is in treatment for substance abuse. \"It just made me feel good.\"   Fakri A., a 17-year-old from the Bronx who is now in treatment, recalled that he was once so drunk after drinking six 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor that he staggered obliviously through a firefight between drug dealers. \"I guess God was looking out for me that day,\" he mused.   Darryl McDaniels, a 28-year-old member of the rap group Run-DMC, recently told a rap magazine that he had been hospitalized for alcoholic pancreatitis, the result of years of drinking as many as eight 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor a day. 'Pack a Lot of Punch'    The 40-ounce bottle was introduced beginning in the mid-80's as a \"retailer and consumer convenience,\" according to Ron Richards, a spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company, maker of the Magnum brand of malt liquor. Store owners like them, he said, because they take up far less shelf space than six-packs.   And in the wake of their introduction, national malt liquor consumption has increased to 82.9 million 2.5-gallon cases in 1992 from 73.6 million in 1989, according to the Jobson Publishing Corporation's Beer Handbook, which predicts sales of 97.8 million cases this year.   The reason for such sales, market researchers say, is the promise of more alcohol for less money.   \"If you measure your serving size by 40 ounces,\" said Peter Reid, editor of Modern Brewery Age, \"it's going to pack a lot of punch.\"   In a comparative analysis, the Marin Institute found that 40 ounces of St. Ides, which at 8 percent alcohol is one of the most powerful malt liquors, has more alcohol than a six-pack of standard beer, and roughly the same amount as five 5-ounce glasses of wine.   Brewery officials deny that their pursuit of a small but lucrative segment of the American liquor market is an effort to entice underage or irresponsible drinking, and they insist that they are not unduly targeting young minority drinkers. Noting that malt liquor sales have always been the highest among minority drinkers, they say they are simply following the dictates of maintaining a market they want to continue to serve.   \"You obviously gear the advertising of any products to groups that tend to prefer them,\" said Randy Smith, a vice president of the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wis., the maker of Colt 45.   He and officials of other breweries say they regularly advertise against irresponsible and underage drinking. And they say they also sponsor a variety of service activities in minority neighborhoods, from concerts, to literacy programs, to scholarships.   \"The industry is very sensitive and spends a lot of money to be responsible,\" said Frank Walters, director of research for M. Shanken Communications in New York, publishers of Impact and Market Watch, leading trade publications.   Two years ago, Heileman Brewing came under fire from black consumer groups and civil rights organizations after introducing Power Master, its most powerful malt liquor at 5.9 percent alcohol, and marketing it specifically to black drinkers. Regulators ordered it off the market, saying the word \"power\" on the label violated a law against using brand names to promote alcohol content. Linking Success With Liquor    Heileman now faces criticism over an advertising campaign for Colt 45 that is aimed at a younger black consumer than before. Gone is a middle-aged black actor, Billy Dee Williams; instead, a polished, soft-spoken younger black man talks of commitment, giving back and success. As he does, he reaches for a can of Colt 45.   Linking black success with malt liquor is cynical and exploitative, critics of the ads say.   \"All this speaks of a slick marketing campaign that has tremendous impact on African-Americans,\" said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Mr. Butts has led a campaign to stem the advertising of alcohol and tobacco products in poor neighborhoods. Popular at Hooky Parties    Judy Corman, a spokeswoman for Phoenix House, a drug-rehabilitation organization, said she was surprised by the response when she asked a roomful of Manhattan teen-agers recently if they had drunk 40-ounce malt liquor.   \"You should have seen the hands go up,\" she said. \"Nearly everyone raised their hands.\"   Jennifer O. was one of them.   The 15-year-old Bronx high school student said she seldom went to classes last year, preferring instead to attend hooky parties at friends' houses, in basements and on rooftops. \"As long as there was music and people,\" recalled Jennifer, who is Puerto Rican.   \"When I went to hooky parties, we used to have boxes and boxes and boxes of 40 ounces in the refrigerator, and we would go crazy,\" she said. She drank to impress her friends, she said, and her ability to drink two bottles of malt liquor back-to-back earned her the nickname, \"Shorty Two Forties.\"   \"The most I drank was three and a half bottles and I was drunk out of my mind,\" Jennifer said.    When asked if there was anything she regretted about her days of drunken malt liquor binges, she paused, and nodded.   \"I lost my virginity,\" she said, \"when I was drunk on 40's.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"'Cybertronics' Finale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/arts/cybertronics-finale.html","abstract":"  Works by the electronic-music composers Tod Machover and Trimpin form the final concerts of the \"Cybertronics\" Series, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea.

In Wagner's version of Original Sin, the ruler of the gods violates his own laws; in the composer's version of the Resurrection, a new world will rise out of the ashes of the old. There are also humbler entertainments, including portraits of marital squabbling and melodramatic villainy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"When State Officials Seize Schools; Education Idea Has Taken Root in New Jersey Since 1986","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/nyregion/when-state-officials-seize-schools-education-idea-has-taken-root-new-jersey.html","abstract":"  Dr. Saul Cooperman says he was standing in his backyard when the idea came to him. \"I remember the exact moment,\" said the former New Jersey Education Commissioner. \"I had been thinking for almost two years: 'How do you improve schools that just don't seem to be able to get it right?' \"    \"Then it hit me,\" he said. \"My God, they declare bankruptcy and go into receivership in the private sector.

Decca/London is currently recording a \"Ring\" conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, and whatever the strengths and weaknesses of that project, it should be fascinating to hear the Cleveland Orchestra in a starring role.   A similar interest attaches to Herbert von Karajan's \"Ring\" with the Berlin Philharmonic (Deutsche Grammophon 435 211-2; 15 CD's), which was recorded in the studio in connection with staged performances of the operas at the Salzburg Easter Festival from 1967 through 1970. The orchestral performance, though never overstated, is superb, and Karajan's conception is thoughtful and compelling; he plays a Wotan of sorts to Georg Solti's Loge in the Decca/ London recording.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"Homes in Pennsylvania;\nDevelopment Revived In Growing Community","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/nyregion/homes-in-pennsylvania-development-revived-in-growing-community.html","abstract":"A 50-acre 120-unit town house community here that was one-third completed a year ago is being revived.

There are passages of delicate mystery, impressionistic vagueness, mild atonality and abstract wanderings as well as stretches that would be comfortable in a suspense film.

Hostage to Abortion Rights    She and the organization's board reasoned that a White House and Congress less hostile to abortion rights would clear the way for a broader agenda.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930417","headline":"30-Year Term Imposed in Attempted Bombing of Israeli Sites","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/17/nyregion/30-year-term-imposed-in-attempted-bombing-of-israeli-sites.html","abstract":"  A man described by his lawyer as an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization was sentenced yesterday to the maximum of 30 years in prison for trying to bomb three Israeli sites in New York City 20 years ago.

It's the stuff of vaudeville, a format that has never been far away from Laurie Anderson's style of performance art. Her large, recurring themes are invariably overshadowed by the oblique brilliance of individual bits.    Ms. Anderson is performing the world premiere of her latest multimedia work, \"Stories From the Nerve Bible,\" at the Annenberg Center through Saturday. It is presented by the American Music Theater Festival. The stage has a row of bright television monitors and large video screens, sliding (like Japanese shoji screens) and suspended. Ms. Anderson sometimes sits at a keyboard, sometimes strolls with an electric violin, sometimes gestures with airport-signal flashlights or plays a synthesizer, trademarked Bodysynth, that is triggered by arm and hand movements. Guy Klucevsek on accordion and keyboard, Greg Cohen on bass and Cyro Baptista on percussion supplement Ms. Anderson's music and voice, creating understated funk vamps and soothing or foreboding sustained chords.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930417","headline":"64 Vaults Weiskopf Into Share of the Lead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/17/sports/golf-64-vaults-weiskopf-into-share-of-the-lead.html","abstract":"  With an explosive, course-record-tying round of 64, Tom Weiskopf burst into a tie for the lead today in the PGA Seniors Championship.

The line has a modal, medieval feeling. It doesn't go anywhere or resolve anything; it seems to float in melodic space. When parts of the melody are heard later, they carry none of the dramatic weight that much of Western music associates with returning themes. Mr. Tavener, like his Eastern European colleagues Arvo Part and Henryk Gorecki, is after something quite different: an experience of timelessness and devotion rather than contrast and evolution.   \"The Protecting Veil,\" which was given its New York premiere recently by the cellist Steven Isserlis and the New England Conservatory Orchestra conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, is unevenly successful in creating that experience. But its iconlike simplicity, along with its programmatic evocation of the life of the Virgin Mary, has helped make this piece an enormous success in a recording on (yes) the Virgin label.

A stand of them can buffer winter winds and save on heating bills. Their roots help to control erosion and hold water in the soil. Their canopies provide shelter for birds and squirrels.   And they are beautiful.

The tram from downtown Oslo to Holmenkollen, 1,150 feet above sea level, is equipped with ski racks, and in summer the Oslo Fjord ferries are crammed with commuters who have taken up temporary residence on summer resort islands in the city.

They are the famous automates, the three mechanical puppets of the Museum of Art and History in Neuchatel.   The cleverest of the three figures is the Scribe, a life-size barefoot boy, 3 or 4 years of age, who is seated at a mahogany desk.  Wielding a goose quill, he tips it in an inkwell and with perfect penmanship writes a short text while his eyes attentively follow the tracing of each letter. His movements are a bit jerky, but surprisingly lifelike. The second figure, also a little boy, in a reddish-brown jacket, is known as the Draftsman. Interchangeable sets of rotating cams tell the puppet to draw; he blows dust off the drawing paper by means of a bellows concealed in his head. The Musician, the central figure, is larger than the other two, representing a teen-age girl with blond curls wearing an elegant blue-and-gold dress. She plays rococo tunes on a period instrument described as an orgue-clavecin, a cross between a harpsichord and a harmonium. She seems to breathe as her chest heaves, she moves her head and eyes, and at the end gets up and makes a graceful bow. The effect is eerie.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Sheryl Kurtz, J. B.

In 1986, she started nursing school and completed training as a drug abuse counselor. Two years later Ms. Baker was hired as a counselor at the women's prison and began to pioneer several programs. But by then she had become ill with an aggressive form of cancer, gradually forcing her to come to work on crutches and later in a wheelchair.

Ah,","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/style/runways-if-purses-could-talk-ah.html","abstract":"  WAITING in line at a fashion show, five mavens in unison turn bottoms up. Down on the ground go their handbags: a big squashy leather Louis Vuitton bucket, its string tie loosened as fingers scrabble into the depths; the faux and the real Kellys, side by side, redundant strap fastenings dangling free; the Prada duffel, bulging like a body bag in unlikely places; a leather shopper with double straps, heaved off a sagging shoulder. The dig for victory over, five bent bodies straighten, faces flushed, invitations flourished like unearthed treasure.   Inside the show, the front-row clients have a different kind of purse -- neat boxy bags nesting on thin thighs. The laps of luxury cradle one classic quilted chain-handled Chanel (the owner hasn't heard that anything that isn't Chanel-funk is out) and three conspicuously new Hermes Kelly bags, one in crocodile, one in burgundy-grained leather and one tan with a nasty scar across the flap. From across the runway, it is easy to spot the Paloma Picasso purse (X marks the status symbol) and the Gianni Versace, hung with more Roman coins than you would find in the ashes of Pompeii. Mostly the purses are discreetly classy -- a faint F for Fendi or G for Gucci stamped into the leather and tidy gilt trimmings. Since they are all hand-held, sleek and small, they bleep out a single signal: my car, driver and well-filled tote are waiting outside.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Human Pheromones","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/style/thing-human-pheromones.html","abstract":"  WHAT: Human pheromones (or at least their synthetic equivalents) in new as-yet-unnamed his and hers fragrances scheduled to go on sale this fall at premium prices but only via infomercials. WHAT ARE THEY Pheromones are chemicals that carry signals that drive the libido to do the lambada, among other things. Animals like pigs and deer and bees and silkworms also use pheromones to stake out territory and send warnings to other members of their species. A male pig, for example, spits in the face of his favorite fertile sow and -- presto! -- she temporarily becomes a nymphomaniac. WHY? The search for human pheromones that, like those of their animal counterparts, would enhance sexuality and excite Eros has long been an obsession of the $4.8 billion fragrance business. Fragrance companies, struggling to heat up stagnant sales with something truly new, have spent millions, if not billions, trying to isolate human pheromones.   If the Erox (echoism intended?) Corporation, a new company in Menlo Park, Calif., has indeed identified human pheromones -- and scientists and fragrance experts are dubious -- and can obtain patents on their synthetic versions, it has stumbled onto a financial mother lode that could take the perfume business into a whole new realm. WHY ELSE? Until a few years ago, scientists took as gospel a 1938 study by an eminent neuroanatomist who contended that humans lacked the proper apparatus, a vomeronasal organ, with which to sense pheromones. And anyway, if we did have one, it was vestigial.   Human pheromones do not have smells, scientists advising Erox say. So unless we had a working vomeronasal organ, we couldn't detect human pheromones, even if they did exist.   But Dr. Larry J. Stensaas, a professor of neuroanatomy and physiologist at the University of Utah who advises Erox, said he had discovered a human vomeronasal organ, which he nicknamed \"the VNO,\" along the septum. Dr. Luis Monti-Bloch, another professor at Utah, has devised a gadget to test whether it works. They say initial studies show it does. WILL HUMAN PHEROMONES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS PIG SPIT? No. Although popular myth and Madison Avenue have suggested that pheromones behave as aphrodisiacs to stimulate the opposite sex, the Erox fragrances are not formulated to attract hordes of libidinous construction workers, for example, to a female wearer. The pheromone compound in the male fragrance was deliberately selected to have the greatest impact on a male wearer, while the female fragrance is steeped with one appealing most to a woman.   Such a state of affairs would seem to defeat the purpose of Erox's grand marketing strategy, which is aimed at heterosexuals, not gays.   In fact, neither fragrance claims to be a sexual magnet for members of either sex. Instead, people who have used the fragrance say it has enhanced their self-confidence and sense of well-being, which, the folks at Erox suggests, may make the wearer more attractive.    \"A sense of confident ease, being more comfortable, may increase sensuality,\" said Pierre de Champfleury, Erox's president and chief executive. \"By feeling more confident, the wearer might feel more free to approach someone he or she might otherwise not approach.\" SOCIAL STUDIES: Remember Musk by Jovan? Perfumers have been using pheromones like musk from deer and castoreum from beavers to concoct fragrances since the pyramids were blueprints. The chemicals act as preservatives and, in some cases, contribute to a scent.   But while advertising often suggests that animal pheromones (or the synthesized equivalents used in modern perfumes) will cast the same spell over humans as they do over animals, pheromones work only on members of the same species. The synthesized pheromones in the new fragrances are clones of extractions from human skin, so they supposedly have an effect on humans. SMELLS FISHY? The experts aren't convinced, either. Their reactions to the notion of human pheromones range from snorts of disbelief to credulity couched in careful language.    \"I've always been extremely skeptical until the last few years,\" said Dr. Gary K. Beauchamp, director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, a leading research institute that studies smell and taste. \"But there have now been a number of investigations suggesting that people do have a vomeronasal organ.   \"Whether it's functional or not is another question.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Perspectives: Use-Based Billing; New Buoys on the Water-Meter Course","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/realestate/perspectives-use-based-billing-new-buoys-on-the-water-meter-course.html","abstract":"  BEWARE the \"extraordinary leak.\" John Alexiou apparently had one in the building he owns at 31-21 23d Avenue in Astoria, Queens, where he runs an insurance business and rents out two apartments upstairs.

This was once the setting for the city's grandest guest quarters, the Portland Hotel, a seven-story, Queen Anne-style beauty built in the 1880's. After entertaining 11 Presidents, and shaping the tastes of a young James Beard, the Portland Hotel was unceremoniously razed in 1951. The site was paved over as a parking lot.

From John Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\" to Caryl Churchill's \"Top Girls,\" from Alan Ayckbourn's \"Absurd Person Singular\" to David Hare's \"Plenty,\" there is hardly a modern English play of any significance (or insignificance) in which the characters are not sniffing out one another's class signals as if to establish who is the mongrel and who the pedigree poodle.   Seldom can that have been more obviously the case than in Willy Russell's \"Blood Brothers,\" the musical opening on Broadway next Sunday at the Music Box Theater. Liverpool twins who are separated as infants accidentally meet and become friends. Mickey (played by Con O'Neill) is brought up in poverty, goes to an inferior school, loses his dead-end job and slips into crime. Edward (Mark Michael Hutchinson) rises to local eminence, thanks to a posh education and all the advantages of wealth. But can the affinity they feel when they meet transcend the built-in bitterness of class? Part folk tale, part social document, \"Blood Brothers\" tries to answer that question.

But it also brought the world into a place where most people were afraid to go out after nightfall. Or at least the slice of the world that television shows, which had about as much to do with the life of this family as an Amy Fisher mini-series has to do with \"Masterpiece Theater.\" The image of the two televisions stayed with me, a symbol of how powerful TV is in the lives of so many families just like that one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Medieval Riches of El Cid's City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/travel/medieval-riches-of-el-cids-city.html","abstract":"BURGOS, about 150 miles north of Madrid, has long been a stopover for serious travelers in northern Spain. Hemingway would visit to watch a bullfight and to dine on trout from the Rio Arlanzon, Castilian roast lamb, and the \"delicate Burgos cheese\" that he used to bring to Gertrude Stein in Paris. Others -- Alexandre Dumas, Hans Christian Andersen, James A. Michener -- usually stayed long enough to see the great Gothic Catedral de Burgos and pay their respects to El Cid, Spain's national hero. \n\nBurgos's location -- at the junction of the main road from France and the east-west Camino de Santiago, the great pilgrim route of the Middle Ages -- helps account for its wealth of historic sites and medieval ambiance. Yet with only 160,000 inhabitants, Burgos has the atmosphere of a small town, and most attractions are within or in walking distance of its beautifully restored old quarter, leaving plenty of time to enjoy the fine Spanish art of \"doing nothing,\" as the 19th-century English writer Richard Ford once observed. Watching the people parade on the Espolon, reading a book in an outdoor cafe, ferreting out little shops and tapas bars in the back streets, stopping along one of the bridges to watch trout fishermen and admiring the dramatic lighting of the monuments on nightly strolls to the city's relaxed restaurants are perfect counterpoints to the historical riches of Burgos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Republicans Hold Clinton Accountable; Senate Childishness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/opinion/l-republicans-hold-clinton-accountable-senate-childishness-577893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Our Government should not be run by filibuster.

Others -- Alexandre Dumas, Hans Christian Andersen, James A.

Yet George Forss chose it, in 1977, and it is plain that his reasons were none of the above. On top of that, the picture, one of 32 black and whites on view at Weston Town Hall, is unforgettable.   This is partly because the liner, sliding past the World Trade Center on inky water, seems to have acquired the two towers as extra funnels. But it also has to do with the weird contrast between the buildings on either side, shrinking back under a dark Ansel Adams sky and the glare from the setting sun that lights up the towers like an explosion.

(Princeton University, $15.95.) Vladimir Nabokov was raised in the happiest of families in the most turbulent of times. The son of wealthy and adoring parents, he was forced to flee Russia with the rest of the family after the Bolshevik revolution, then to flee Europe as the Nazis closed in. Yet, as this first volume of Brian Boyd's biography shows, neither turmoil nor subsequent poverty impeded his writing. \"Nabokov's life reads like a work by a very imaginative creator,\" Sergei Davydov said here in 1990. \"Mr. Boyd gives us that life and ventures many shrewd glimpses beyond it. As a biography his book can hardly be surpassed.\" Princeton University has also reissued Mr. Boyd's second volume, VLADIMIR NABOKOV: The American Years ($16.95), an exploration of the two decades Nabokov spent in the United States.

The pieces he works on in the video are from his much-discussed series titled \"Lynch Fragments.\" There are 70 of these compressed works in the show, and the way they are arrayed one after the other on the gallery walls reminds one of a string of bullet holes made by an outsized antiaircraft gun. \n\n\"Lynch Fragments\" is not a pretty title, and the works are meant to disturb; but they also fascinate and elicit an occasional laugh. They range from the essentially frontal and symmetrical \"Afro Phoenix No. 2\" (1964) to the exercise in loose and loopy forms that is \"Dry Days\" (1992).

In flimsy machines built of cloth, wood and wire, the new knights of the air engaged in one-on-one combat during World War I in which skill and luck combined to create a different form of chivalry. LEGEND, MEMORY AND THE GREAT WAR IN THE AIR (Smithsonian Institution/University of Washington, cloth, $34.95; paper, $18.95) both debunks and enriches the myths that developed almost immediately around military aviation. The authors -- Dominick A. Pisano, a curator in aeronautics at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, and Thomas J. Dietz, Joanne M. Gernstein and Karl S. Schneide, all curatorial assistants at the museum -- describe how military commanders developed the strategies that remain part of the doctrine of air warfare to this day, how they learned through trial and error what was effective, and how aviators lost their lives as the subjects of these experiments. The book also details how myths about aerial combat were formulated in contemporary propaganda, posters for movies made a half-generation after the war, and the misty-eyed memoirs of aces. \"Legend, Memory and the Great War in the Air\" is a concise synopsis of the origin of a modern form of combat and its impact on our culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Electoral Reform Is the Focus of Italian Referendums","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/world/electoral-reform-is-the-focus-of-italian-referendums.html","abstract":"  Italians vote in a series of referendums on Sunday and Monday that ostensibly chart the nation's future but also provide a chance to pass a verdict on its past.

Still, Hollywood cartoons can impinge on a nerve, activating reservoirs of shame and secret longing, tapping into inadmissible impulses, in the process providing a release for moral and sexual anxiety in much the way that horror movies are said to release other types of tension. Consider \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Basic Instinct\" and, with an opening-week gross of $25 million, the current leading box-office attraction, \"Indecent Proposal,\" a film that begins in the soft focus of a Kotex ad, and goes on to prove that nothing is sacred.   The picture's evocative title instantly telegraphs the link it draws between sex and money, the two issues that even the most sanguine individuals are least sanguine about. This combination is examined through a premise that is as bogus as it is intriguing: can a middle-class marriage survive after a devoted wife sells herself for an evening to a stunning-but-lonely billionaire winsomely played by a guarded-yet-tender Robert Redford?
