But women are rediscovering the traditional handbag, the one that is literally carried in the hand. It looks good for dress-up occasions and doesn't mar the line of a tailored jacket or a delicate dress.    In recent seasons, the structured handbag with a handle on top has been the accessory of choice for models in fashion shows, usually held by a gloved hand for a touch of old-fashioned elegance. Think of movie stars like Grace Kelly or Audrey Hepburn boarding a train with a squarish cosmetics case in hand.

That removed a big barrier to House passage of the tax bill later this week. The dissidents had held the bill hostage for two weeks, obliquely threatening to block a final vote on it unless they were guaranteed that Congress would not rush tax cuts into law and then renege on its promise to cut spending as well. The accord yesterday gave leaders assurance that their five-year, $189 billion package of tax cuts would pass an increasingly skeptical House. HEALTH INSURANCE DEDUCTION -- The Senate agreed to extend a tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed workers. The measure, contained in a House-Senate conference report, cleared the Senate by a unanimous voice vote and now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. The measure would allow an estimated 3.2 million self-employed people to deduct for tax purposes 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. MEDICARE -- The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in 2002, the Clinton Administration told Congress. The annual report said that Medicare's hospital insurance program was now \"severely out of financial balance\" and that there was an urgent need for Congress to address the problem. But it recommended no specific measures.

If his stacking of his narrative decks seems like cheating, the payoffs are usually worth the chicanery.   \"Three Viewings,\" at Manhattan Theater Club, consists of three monologues, each delivered by a different character in the same funeral parlor in a small town outside Pittsburgh. In the sharpest one, \"The Thief of Tears,\" Margaret Whitton plays a tough cookie named Mac who flies from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh for the funeral of her rich, tyrannical grandmother. \"Thirteen Things About Ed Carpolotti\" finds Virginia (Penny Fuller), the middle-aged widow of a wheeler-dealer with ties to organized crime, in dire straits.

The 246-to-188 vote, largely along party lines, put the House's stamp on a plan that would reduce tax revenues by $189 billion over five years, fully $105 billion of that in the form of a $500-a-child credit to taxpaying families. Billions more would go to breaks aimed at retirees, investors and corporations. The bill now goes to a Senate far less inclined toward major tax reduction this year, but whose leader, Senator Bob Dole, faces strong pressure from within his own party to follow the House's lead. RATING CONGRESS -- The public gives a decidedly mixed review of the Republican Congress's first 100 days and is particularly skeptical about the leadership's ability to deliver both large tax cuts and a balanced budget, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
