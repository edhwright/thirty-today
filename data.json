It was certainly so for the Spaniards who passed through the Borrego Desert on their way from Sonora to San Francisco, and for the gold-dreamers who later made this a route from East to West. Even today, a motorist traveling these roads is daunted by the prospect of actually getting out of the car; the vast expanses, the big sky and the paucity of vegetation make it seem easier to just keep going.\n\nThis forbidding landscape has been a mixed blessing for the little town of Borrego Springs, which sits in an oasis of low-key commerce, completely surrounded by Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Unlike Palm Springs, its prosperous neighbor 90 miles to the north, Borrego Springs is not served by any major highway; the closest Interstate access is Route 8, about an hour's drive to the south. The nearest urban center is San Diego, about 90 miles southwest, and the climate there is already dry and salubrious. The little Borrego Springs airport serves only chartered or private aircraft.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"California's New Desert Parks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/travel/california-s-new-desert-parks.html","abstract":"  I WAS wandering around the Mojave Desert in the dead of winter, looking for some clue to the essence of a place once dismissed as a poor excuse for hell. It was not an easy task. As a native of the Pacific Northwest, where it can rain 150 inches a year on the coast, and evergreen forests are so thick they create their own climate, I was raised on a sylvan image of natural beauty. The desert, bald and arid, was like a foreign language.    There were knockout views, a moonrise over the purple-hued Panamint Range in Death Valley, late light on the rock slabs of Joshua Tree, and odd-shaped freaks of dry-country evolution darting in and out of burrows. The winter sun, a breakfast of palm dates and fresh scones, fuschia-colored cliffs -- all of it was memorable. Still, the desert of southern California, the nation's largest single expanse of parkland and wilderness in the contiguous 48 states after an act of Congress last fall gave most of it protected status, remained something of a stranger. Then I went to the Kelso Dunes, a wind-sculptured sand monument in the middle of the Mojave National Preserve, which is sandwiched between the two new national parks of Death Valley and Joshua Tree.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Survivors of Negro League Reaping the Benefits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/sports/sports-business-survivors-of-negro-league-reaping-the-benefits.html","abstract":"  There was more than a little historical irony last week when Major League Baseball presented checks worth $143,248 to benefit surviving Negro League players and their legacy.

Studies have shown that it contains phenylethylamine, a chemical stimulant, which is released by the brain in a passionate love affair. Perhaps that explains why so many people eat chocolate on Valentine's Day (conversely, those who fall out of love have lower levels of phenylethylamine, which may explain why they often go on a chocolate binge). In any event, there are few better ways to end a Valentine's Day dinner than with a dessert made from chocolate.    I like chocolate desserts that are fairly straightforward, and not too sweet. A dark, moist chocolate cake, unadorned by creams or icings, is one of my favorites. I also love a hot chocolate souffle, something I like to order in French restaurants when they have it on the menu. Making a hot souffle at home, however, is not difficult if you have a reliable oven. It is important to use egg whites at room temperature, since they will expand more when they are beaten and help the souffle rise. They should be whisked until they form glossy peaks, not over-beaten or over-folded, or the souffle will be flat. Care should also be taken when melting chocolate. It turns into a solid lump if the heat is too high. Melt it in a slow oven or a double boiler.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Last Refuge of Smokers: Very Small Restaurants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/travel/travel-advisory-last-refuge-of-smokers-very-small-restaurants.html","abstract":"  For travelers who want to combine dining and smoking, New York City's new smoking law provides a single loophole: go to a very small restaurant.

There are also plenty of surprises. What is familiar is the artist's signature themes: consumerism, recycled imagery from comic books and 1960's advertising and a penchant for ironic quotations from other artworks. What is surprising is how profoundly the graphic work has fed -- and in some instances proved a catalyst to -- the artist's innovation on canvas. Most startling are Mr. Lichtenstein's pre-Pop prints from the early 1950's, which provide an unusual look at some of his earliest artistic sources. Here, quirky images of knights in armor, damsels in distress and tomahawk-wielding Indians look to Paul Klee and Picasso as their inspiration, rather than to contemporary culture. Here, too, the reader sees foreshadowings of the artist's later visual language: the Ben Day dots, artificial wood grain, parallel stripes and black outlines of his hallmark Pop pieces. The prints, which Mary Lee Corlett, a research associate at the National Gallery of Art, has arranged in chronological order, are divided into three sections: prints made by the artist, prints made in conjunction with events at the Leo Castelli Gallery and prints and related objects that were mass produced. Ruth E. Fine, the National Gallery's curator of modern prints and drawings, has provided a plodding, though fact-filled, essay examining the symbiosis between Mr. Lichtenstein's graphic works and his paintings, as well as the artist's seminal role in the print renaissance of the 1960's. This is an eye-opening book, unusual for the light it sheds on aspects of Roy Lichtenstein's career that were previously unexamined.

There will be, however, a reindeer (actually a pigeon with antlers) named Pesto and a musical number, \"Slippin' on the Ice,\" sung to the tune of \"Singin' in the Rain.\"   This is \"Animaniacs,\" the second most popular children's series on television (outranked only by \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\"), now in its second season on Fox. What's unusual is the animated show's popularity with adults. More than 21 percent of the weekday audience (4 P.M., Monday through Friday) and more than 23 percent of the Saturday morning (9 A.M.) viewers are adults 25 or older. The show has a large and loyal Internet news-group following, with fans exchanging thoughts electronically on laundry tips for fading \"Animaniacs\" T-shirts, the latest parody lyrics and concerns that Wakko, one of the main characters, seems withdrawn lately.   \"I got hooked on the show immediately,\" says Jay Maynard, a 34-year-old systems programmer from Houston, who discovered it on a weekday when he was at home sick. \"The thing that caught me is that it's literally full of jokes that no 10-year-old would ever get.\" Then why do 10-year-olds, not to mention 4-year-olds, watch? \"There's enough slapstick physical comedy to keep them happy.\"   Now Mr. Maynard tapes the show daily. \"I have developed a crush on Dot,\" he says. \"Her personality is everything I'm looking for in a woman -- witty, intelligent, outspoken, assertive.\"   The Warner brothers (Yakko and Wakko) and the Warner sister (Dot) are the series stars, but the 30-minute show includes cartoons starring other characters (almost all animals), who exist in their own separate comic universes just as Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Daffy Duck always have. The Warner siblings are the favorite characters of many viewers, but not all. Jean MacCurdy, president of Warner Brothers Animation, professes a preference for Pinky and the Brain, two laboratory mice who plot nightly to take over the world. \"And they're Steven's favorites,\" Ms. MacCurdy adds. That would be Steven Spielberg, the show's executive producer.   \"We're really pleased with the broad demographic appeal,\" says Ms. MacCurdy. \"There's a feeling that even the older kids kind of like the fact that there are some jokes their younger brothers and sisters don't understand. It's an empowerment thing.\"   The nature of the humor is clear from the opening theme song, in which the word \"animaniacs\" is rhymed with, among other things, \"the President plays the sax,\" \"pay-for-play contracts\" and \"baloney in our slacks.\" Zany is rhymed with \"Citizen Kane-y.\"   Yakko, Wakko and Dot, who apparently were locked away in the water tower on the Warner's Burbank lot many years ago because of misbehavior, escape periodically to have adventures that are a combination of visual gags so old they reek of homage (that's just what they are, says Ms. MacCurdy) and wordplay.   IN ONE EPISODE, SET IN A CANDY store, the owner asks the trio what they'd like. \"Well, world peace would be nice,\" one answers. \"And a Chevrolet in every driveway.\" In terms of candy, they insist on the jelly beans on the highest shelf (this is one of those candy stores with 30-foot ceilings). After the owner climbs a very tall ladder to get the candy and bring it down, the kids (there is some debate about what kind of animals the Warners are) change their mind. And there is an invasion by a band of five nuns wielding rulers.   Sometimes the humor is all verbal, and somewhat insiderish. Yakko: \"It's that time again.\" Dot: \"To make fun of the Disney Channel?\" Yakko: \"If you can't say something nice, you're probably at the Ice Capades.\"   The Brain, of Pinky and the Brain, is stopped by a police officer and unable to produce a driver's license or registration papers for the mini-van he stole from the lab. So he admits his world-conquest plans but promises to include \"new funding for law enforcement\" when he controls the universe. The cop lets him go.   Skippy Squirrel, another character with his own segments, always wants his Aunt Slappy, who says things like \"Oh, for the love of Al Gore\" and \"All right already, Mr. Story Editor,\" to read him a bedtime story. When she takes Skippy to see the classic movie \"Bumbie, the Dearest Deer,\" he is so upset by the death of Bumbie's mother that Aunt Slappy takes him to visit the actress who played her. The actress is quite old now, lives in a trailer park and brags about having dated George Jetson in her youth.   And there is Mindy, the baby girl who insists on calling her mother Lady, and Mindy's dog, Buttons. Mom leaves the two alone, entering the house with the line \"Now to call Mary Beth and gloat about my new apron.\"   Music is an important part of the mix. There have been parodies of the \"Gilligan's Island\" theme song, a song about the unimportance of humans in the big universe (\"We're tiny little specks about the size of Mickey Rooney,\" which is rhymed with puny) and the series' claim to educational value, Yakko's operettalike recitation of the name of every nation on the globe. As Rita the cat singing about her move by boxcar to Monterey, Calif., says: \"Hey, it's a cartoon. What'd you expect? Sondheim?\"   Tom Ruegger, the show's senior producer, swears that \"Animaniacs\" was born one day when he drove onto the Warner lot and looked up at the water tower. \"We needed a marquee name,\" he recalls. \"So we thought, what if we made the Warner Brothers into cartoon characters?\" Yakko, Wakko and Dot's personalities, he says, are based on \"real kids, with that creating-havoc-in-the-back-of-the-car energy.\" Mr. Ruegger's own children were 8, 6 and 4 at the time.   About 25 sets of characters were presented to Mr. Spielberg for approval. He seemed to really like four or five; he killed several on the spot. \"Some family members of his dropped by,\" says Mr. Ruegger. \"Mindy and Buttons survived the cut that day because one of his kids pointed to Mindy and said, 'Yes.

Under the 6-to-2 ruling, frequent fliers who think the airlines have not lived up to their promises can go to state courts and sue for breach of contract.   The decision permits a lawsuit filed against American Airlines on behalf of four million members of its AAdvantage program to go forward in Illinois. The plaintiffs claim that American, which created the first frequent flier program, breached its contract with members in 1988 when it announced that the free tickets earned with frequent flier miles could not be used on certain dates and flights. The new rules -- blackout dates and capacity controls -- reduced the value of miles already accumulated.   American says that it has added many benefits to its frequent flier program and that AAdvantage members have always been on notice that it could change the terms of the program at any time. Still to be established at trial is whether the airline reserved the right to impose the changes retroactively -- a practice familiar to a number of passengers, who are discovering that the 20,000 miles that once earned a free round-trip domestic coach ticket now fall 5,000 miles short.   The Supreme Court's decision is no guarantee of victory to the plaintiffs. Another part of the lawsuit, which claims that American violated the Illinois consumer fraud statute, is barred by Federal law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in the majority opinion.   And there is some ambiguity about what effect a courtroom victory would have. Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, said the case could lead airlines to become less creative and more cautious with their frequent flier plans. \"I'm not sure if there will be any winners in this case,\" he said.

The show may be enjoyed as entertainment -- like a trip to the zoo -- but Dr. Benton, who is a professor of art history at Pace University in Pleasantville, has also written a scholarly, very readable catalogue essay.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Without Portfolio: Wartime Art Daredevils","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/arts/art-without-portfolio-wartime-art-daredevils.html","abstract":"  THEY WERE UNLIKELY heroes, Oskar Schindlers of art, sleuths and scavengers who stymied the Nazis to rescue Nefertiti and other looted statuary, master paintings, carved altarpieces and synagogue silver during and after World War II.

The Penguins moved closer to the N.H.L. record 15 games without a loss at the start of a season, set by the Edmonton Oilers in 1984-85. Pittsburgh's Ken Wregget, the only N.H.L. goaltender to play every minute this season, has allowed 3 goals or fewer in 9 of the 11 games. The unbeaten streak is his career best and he has notched 10 victories for the ninth consecutive season. The Penguins' only non-victory was last Sunday's 3-3 tie at New Jersey. (AP) WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  Texas Tech Rebounds With Team Effort  Alicia Thompson came off the bench to score 21 points in 16 minutes, and No. 4 Texas Tech rebounded from its first Southwest Conference loss this season to defeat Baylor, 100-48, yesterday at Lubbock.

(AP) TRACK AND FIELD  Jackson Returns to Form in Hurdles  Colin Jackson rebounded from his first defeat in 18 months by posting the fastest 60-meter hurdles time of the year yesterday, clocking 7.39 seconds at a Britain-France dual meet in Glasgow. Beaten by an American, Allen Johnson, Thursday at Madrid for his first loss in 45 races, Jackson, a Welshman who is world champion and world record-holder over 110 meters outdoors, was quickest off the blocks and beat Tony Jarrett of Wales, the world championship silver medalist. Meanwhile, the world and Olympic 100-meter champion Linford Christie of Britain clocked the second-fastest 60-meter time this year, 6.56. (AP) QUEENS, BRONX SCHOOLS WIN TITLES: St. Francis Prep of Queens and Cardinal Spellman of the Bronx won team titles yesterday in the Catholic High Schools Athletic Association girls' sectional indoor track and field championships at the West 168th Street Armory.

SPEED SKATING  Ritsma Leading at World Championships  The favorite, Rintje Ritsma of the Netherlands, took the lead halfway through the men's world speed skating championships at Baselga di Pine, Italy, even though his best showing in two races yesterday was a third-place finish. Ritsma, the Olympic silver medal winner and European champion, placed third in the 500-meter event and fifth in the 5,000 meters to earn 80.72 points.    Hiroyuki Noake of Japan toughed snow and fog early in the day to win the 500-meter event in 37.91 seconds. Later starters benefited when the snow stopped. Frank Dittrich of Germany took advantage of the change and skated an exceptional 5,000-meter race (6:56.66) and broke the track record by more than 40 seconds.

They are going to be cheated -- because their country has yet to give day care the serious attention it deserves.   According to a recent study of hundreds of day care centers in California, Colorado, Connecticut and North Carolina, conducted by child psychologists and economists at four universities, the care provided by most is so poor it threatens the youngsters' emotional and intellectual development. As for the parents, 90 percent of whom rated the care as \"good,\" they were sadly misinformed, either because they did not recognize quality care or did not demand it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950213","headline":"Sports of The Times; Role Models Abound As Well as Rebound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/13/sports/sports-of-the-times-role-models-abound-as-well-as-rebound.html","abstract":"  Contrary to the prevailing notion that professional basketball has been taken hostage by marauders from Generation X, not one player refused to enter a game here this weekend, or walked into America West Arena with his sneakers unlaced.

That makes his stumbling appearance last Friday at a meeting in Kazakhstan with the leaders of 12 former Soviet republics all the more shocking and puzzling.    At a moment when his presidency has been badly shaken by the brutal Russian attack on Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin wobbled across the sidewalk in the Kazakh capital of Almaty, desperately gripping aides for support. His face was puffy and sallow. Before canceling a later news conference, he attempted to answer questions at a photo session and was barely able to speak.

What was most significant in this uninspired group of almost 30 shows, produced for the first time under the auspices of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, was that the drabness seemed completely unintended. There was no coded message about a treacherous economy nor any new resolve to blend in with the concrete city landscape.

Exoticism was one of two topics explored in the New York Festival of Song's program of French music on Saturday evening at the 92d Street Y. The other theme, amorous misadventure, was also a mainstay of French composers.    Michael Barrett and Steven Blier, the festival's directors, presented several solutions to the problem of combining East and West. Maurice Delage struck a tenuous but fascinating balance in his \"Poemes Hindous\" (1912). The accompaniments sometimes approximated the sounds of an Indian ensemble, with a cello mimicking the elastic pitches of a sitar and violins supplying a tamboura drone.
