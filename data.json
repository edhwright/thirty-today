But while Medicare-for-all might be the right prescription for Mr. Stark, it is the wrong reform for the rest of us. Medicare has demonstrably failed to control costs and provide first-rate care.

In October 1945, while I was aiding Holocaust survivors for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in Linz, Austria, Oskar Schindler asked for and received our help, based on documents that he had saved hundreds of Jews by giving them employment in his factory in Cracow -- verified to me by survivors. Schindler expressed to me his fear of the revenge of the Nazis, and therefore wanted help to obtain work in Bavaria, where he thought it would be safer because United States occupation troops would be there for some time to come.   \"Schindler's List,\" Thomas Keneally's book, refers to what happened in 1963, when Schindler was hissed on the streets of Frankfurt and even had to pay damages to a German worker he punched for calling him a \"Jew kisser.\" Bitter irony that in 1994, as you point out, fear of Nazi revenge has not been eradicated.   Mr. Keneally's book accurately reports that in 1949 the Joint Distribution Committee gave Schindler financial aid for his nutria farm in Argentina, which failed, and in 1959 for his cement factory in Frankfurt, which also failed.    These modest gestures of support were by no means compensation for Schindler's heroic achievements, but, long before Mr. Keneally and Mr. Spielberg made Oskar Schindler's name an international byword, the American Jewish community demonstrated its gratitude to this unusual man.

But more than two million of those do not collect because they do not know about it. Tens of millions more low-paid workers could receive the tax refund as part of their monthly paycheck, rather than waiting for a lump-sum payment at the end of the year, but do not know to apply for this \"advanced payment\" option. The Clinton Administration took an important step this week when it instructed Cabinet secretaries and agency heads to notify Federal employees about the option.    Private employers must also make sure their low-paid workers know about the credit. The earned income tax credit is a nearly ideal anti-poverty weapon. It lifts families above poverty, and rewards work because the credit is tied to earnings. Workers earning less than $23,755 are eligible for a credit that reaches a maximum of $2,500 a year. Under the advanced payment option, as much as $100 a month is added to a worker's paychecks. To get advanced payment, workers need only fill out form W-5 from the Internal Revenue Service, which requires answering four straightforward yes-or-no questions.   The Clinton Administration fought hard to raise the tax credit during last year's bruising budget battle. It was the first of a series of steps to eliminate poverty in families with full-time workers. Congress obliged. But many go without money they are due. It is up to employers everywhere to notify workers about Congress's good deed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940311","headline":"John Bobbitt Takes to the Road And Finds It Strewn With Cash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/us/john-bobbitt-takes-to-the-road-and-finds-it-strewn-with-cash.html","abstract":"  Both of the Bobbitts may have been through hell, but their lawyers are working hard to find them rewards after the traumas of the bedroom and the courtroom.

Brent Barry scored a career-high 31 points for Oregon State (6-20, 2-15), which lost its seventh in a row and 20th over all for the first time ever. (AP) California 62, Washington 56: Lamond Murray scored 20 of his 22 points in the second half and No. 16 California broke open a close game in the final three minutes. Jason Kidd scored just 12 points on 2-for-12 shooting, including 1 of 7 from 3-point range. Cal (13-4, 22-6) will wind up its regular season at Washington State. (AP) YACHT RACING  Intrum Justitia's Lead Is Cut  Light winds caused Intrum Justitia to lose all except two miles of its lead yesterday in the closing stages of the fourth leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race. Only 24 hours earlier, Intrum Justitia, a European Whitbread 60 Class yacht, had a lead of 56 nautical miles over New Zealand Endeavour, the leading Maxi Class entry. Four other boats were closing in on Intrum Justitia as the fleet approached the finish of the 5,900-mile leg at Punta del Este, Uruguay. Intrum, skippered by Britain's Lawrie Smith, was reported 472 miles from the finish. Grant Dalton's New Zealand Endeavour was 474 miles from the finish. Tokio holds the overall lead of almost 20 hours after three legs. (AP) SKIING Schneider Wins 50th Cup Title  Vreni Schneider of Switzerland set the pace with a blistering first run on the slalom, then backed it up on the second run and won her 50th World Cup skiing title yesterday at Mammoth Mountain, Calif. The victory moved her ahead of Penilla Wiberg of Sweden in the overall World Cup standing with only races at Vail, Colo., next week left on the tour. Schneider had a combined time of 1 minute 18.52 seconds, more than a full second ahead of Katja Koren of Solvenia, who was second in 1:19.55. Martina Ertl of Germany was third in 1:20.18. Carrie Sheinberg of Port Washington, L.I., was the top American at 11th, posting a personal best despite starting 37th on the first run and finishing 14th.  (AP)  Junior Super-G Is Postponed: The world junior Alpine championships were scheduled to resume today after event organizers postponed the boys' super-G yesterday on Whiteface Mountain in Lake Placid, N.Y., because of poor weather conditions. In the opening downhills Wednesday, Kevin Wert of British Columbia took the gold medal and Jason Rosener of Colorado the bronze in the boys' event, and Melanie Suchet of France won the girls'. The competition is for racers ages 16-18.  BOWLING  Duke Regains Petraglia Lead  Norm Duke had a 236 average over 18 games, and reclaimed the lead yesterday after three rounds of the Professional Bowlers Association's $170,000 Brunswick Johnny Petraglia Open at North Brunswick, N.J. Duke, who led after the first qualifying round, had a pinfall of 4,264 and entered the first round of match play with a 77-pin lead. David Ozio was second, 24 pins ahead of Bob Benoit.

Following hot on the heels of an impressive \"Art Show,\" it proves almost as solid in quality of material and even greater in range.    Range in this case means 95 dealers offering everything from Old Master drawings to contemporary prints and generous helpings of photography. The bounty is further swelled by an unusually high proportion of works in painterly media like pastel (lovely Joan Mitchells), watercolor (landscapes by the 19th-century French artist Paul Huet), gouache (a sweet little Milton Avery pig, among others) and even a thickly painted oil-on-paper by Edwin Dickinson.   One can get the clearest sense of paper's versatility simply by taking a rubbernecking walk through this huge, diverse show. Spanierman Gallery is a good place to start, with a beautiful selection of American late-19th-century work. Two 1916 etchings at Sylvan Cole nearby -- Childe Hassam's stately skyscrapers and John Marin's tipsy, punched-in Woolworth Building -- show the generational divide as American art got the message of modernism.    There are some smart one-artist installations -- notably of Hans Bellmer's mid-1930's photographs at Adam J. Boxer and of Man Ray's Dada photographs at One Bond Masterworks -- and a good mix of Old Master work, with concentrations on mid-18th-to-19th-century European artists still under known on these shores.    Given the sheer variety at hand, though, viewers can write their own tickets as to what they want to see. One can approach the show looking for humor, in the subtle caricatures of artists by Francois Andre Vincent (1746-1816), for example; or for inspiration: an 18th-century chalk drawing of the nude muse of poetry might do. And it is possible to customize any number of esoteric theme tours: of things that grow in the ground, say (botanical prints and Emil Nolde's \"Red Poppies\"), or of things that fly (Audubon engravings and children's book illustrations with more fairies and angels than you can count).   Most memorable, though, are individual images that hold the eye just that extra second or two: the red chalk head of a sleepy child by Jakob Mathias Schmutzer (1733-1811) at Nocolas Joly/Yves Mikaeloff, a Daubigny pencil landscape at Stoppenbach and Delestre, and a mysterious little drawing at Hill-Stone by Battista Franco (circa 1510-56) in which skulls, human and animal, form a pattern as intricate and threadlike as a textile design.    One might wish for work by young contemporary artists and a little cultural diversity (one gallery has Japanese prints, another Indian miniatures; otherwise, it is Euro-North American all the way), but this is a fascinating and unusually lively show: a paper trail, in short, definitely worth following.

It has been performed in Edinburgh, Washington, Miami, Fort Worth and Minnesota. And now, directed by Colin Graham, who wrote the libretto and encouraged Mr. Paulus to take on the project in the first place, a new production has come to the Boston Lyric Opera, where it can be seen until March 20.   Part of the opera's appeal is its source, James M. Cain's 1934 novel. That book's sharply etched plot and hard-boiled, flat-voiced irony has spawned a small entertainment industry, inspiring at least four filmed versions (two of them American) and a classic French novel (Camus said it was a model for \"The Stranger\"). The melodramatic story of a ne'er-do-well drifter, Frank Chambers, who stops in at a roadside diner run by Nick, a good-natured Greek immigrant, and ends up plotting his murder with Cora, Nick's lusty hellcat wife, sizzles with menace, eroticism and brutality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940311","headline":"Disney Can Make American History Fun; 'We Cannot Consecrate'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/opinion/l-disney-can-make-american-history-fun-we-cannot-consecrate-435040.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I agree with you on the potential \"Disneyfication\" of Prince William County (editorial, Feb. 24).

As Congress sorts out the options, it needs to scrap the Clinton plan in favor of the \"single payer\" approach that works so well in Canada -- where virtually all medical providers are paid by the Government.\n\nAdvocates for managed competition, which forms the basis of the Clinton plan, attribute soaring costs to overinsurance that leads to too much care, too much choice and too little medical competition. But Americans, who already pay the world's highest out-of-pocket costs, have fewer doctor visits, hospital days and even transplants than Canadians, who spend less and have greater choice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940311","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE : Mina Tannenbaum","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/style/IHT-the-movie-guide-mina-tannenbaum.html","abstract":"Directed by Martine Dugowson.
