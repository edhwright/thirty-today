And legislators are again at loggerheads over rent controls that masquerade as boons to the city's poor and middle class, but actually hurt them by inflating the cost of housing and robbing the city of badly needed tax revenues.   There's not much good about rent controls, despite their undeserved popularity among tenants. They reduce property tax revenues, discourage construction of new rental apartments and speed the deterioration of older housing. Controls are making a sick real estate market sicker.

Well, the New York Mets, now plumbing baseball depths unseen since the amazin' summer of 1962, have produced a player who's approaching an 82-year-old record for futility. Anthony Young, a young pitcher of some promise, lost his 21st game in a row yesterday, when he was beaten by the Phillies, 5 to 3. He is closing steadily on the major league mark of 23, set in 1910-11 by Cliff Curtis of the old (and legendarily inept) Boston Braves.   Mr. Young endures all this with remarkable dignity, acknowledging the pain of his predicament but never giving in to it by whining. That attitude -- and the occasional strong performance -- is what keeps him in the rotation, and in the hunt for the record. Paradoxically, you have to be pretty good to lose that many in a row -- if you're completely overmatched, you'll be back in the bush leagues in a second.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930614","headline":"Health Care Emerges as Issue at Bishops' Meeting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/us/health-care-emerges-as-issue-at-bishops-meeting.html","abstract":"  The overhaul of the nation's health-care system and its potential links with abortion will vie for attention with theological intricacies and sexual scandals when the nation's Roman Catholic bishops meet this week in New Orleans.

Mr. McCartney and the Beatles mean so much to so many people that the hush that greeted him between songs felt like a result of a reconciliation of the private experience of the Beatles' music -- listening to the records at home as a backdrop to adolescence -- and the public experience of sitting at a sold-out stadium.   The contradictions between one's memories of the material and its presentation in a stadium were jarring; much of the Beatles' music was a pure product of the recording studio, irreproducible in concert. It didn't help much that a third of the way into the concert, Mr. McCartney magically metamorphosed from a Beatle into an Elton John act-alike, sentimental, and willing to turn the personal into a spectacle of amiability, hardly the original intent of the music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930614","headline":"G.O.P.

at the turn of the century and popular during its early years, \"Cinderella\" (nee \"Cendrillon\") had a rare revival at Loretto-Hilton Center on Saturday afternoon. Massenet's setting invites spectacle on both the visual and the vocal scale. The Opera Theater of St. Louis has responded by avoiding the first and embracing the second.   Using a bare brick wall as background and a stage that reaches into the small audience space, Neil Peter Jampolis's design creates spectacle by inference. Portraits are hung and sconces attached. Lighting projections designed by Christopher Akerlind imply grand staircases, towering ballroom spaces or leafy arbors. Such parsimony is turned to musical advantage, directing our attention to the displays of singing on which the opera's uneven virtues ultimately depend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Ferreting Out False Claims For Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/nyregion/ferreting-out-false-claims-for-welfare.html","abstract":"  When Vanessa F. needed money for the security deposit on a new apartment, she thought she had a foolproof solution: welfare fraud.   \"I thought it would be pretty easy to do,\" Vanessa said. \"A lot of people do it by going to the different towns and giving different addresses.

Over the last several months they have reached a rough consensus that the vast plates that comprise the ocean floor sink deep into the earth's mantle, only to be recycled into giant ascending plumes of hot rock. The plumes, driven, some believe, by heat from the earth's core, emerge to form strings of oceanic islands like the Hawaiian chain or to blanket continents with huge sheets of lava.   The discoveries, said Dr. Michael E. Wysession, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who is an authority on the earth's interior, constitute \"a second revolution,\" comparable in scientific terms to the theory of plate tectonics, which, when it came to be accepted three decades ago, showed that the continents had been in constant motion over the course of geological time, carried along by great plates.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Bridge Toll Divides City Of New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/nyregion/bridge-toll-divides-city-of-new-york.html","abstract":"  A seemingly simple dispute over tolls on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge has pitted Staten Island against the rest of the city, and is likely to be decided by Congress.

Twenty years later, Mr. Pogorelich made headlines when his elimination before the final round caused a ruckus among the jurors. Mr. Pogorelich ended up far better known than that year's winner, the Vietnamese pianist Dang Thai Son.    Mr. Pollini and Mr. Pogorelich are about to have something else in common: both are involved with new piano competitions, and both are hoping, against the odds, that they can identify pianists who will stand out in the already overcrowded field of contest winners.

The event also marks Andre Agassi's return from a two-month layoff from right wrist problems. Agassi practiced in private for 25 minutes before rain halted his workout. He will play Carl-Uwe Steeb of Germany today. Karbacher's victory was his third in three meetings -- and second in three weeks -- against Chang, who is seeded third at Halle. The German defeated Chang in the second round of the French Open. Yesterday, Karbacher broke Chang in the eighth game en route to winning the first set and again after falling behind by 2-0 in the second set. Chang rallied to win that set, but another break by Karbacher in the final set spurred him to victory and brought Chang's warmup for Wimbledon to an abrupt end. (AP)   Sprinkles in Manchester: Henrik Holm of Sweden and Nicolas Pereira of Venezuela were the only winners yesterday when rain cut short the opening day of play at the Manchester grass-court tournament in England. Holm, seeded second, dropped the first set against Brett Steven of New Zealand before rebounding to win, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4. Pereira needed three sets and two tie breakers to beat Alex O'Brien of Amarillo, Tex., 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Five other singles matches were postponed until today, and qualifying rounds for the doubles competition were moved indoors. Holm will next face either his countryman Anders Jarryd or Luis Herrera of Mexico. Pereira, the world's top-ranked junior in 1988, will meet either eighth-seeded Guillaume Raoux of France or Gianluca Pozzi of Italy.

I have observed another unintended result. Since medical insurance reimburses doctors far more for procedures than for spending time listening to and talking to patients about their illnesses, many doctors have, where possible, shifted to an increased use of procedures. There are many legitimate reasons for this -- for instance, new technology and fear of malpractice suits for not using the latest tools available.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"Needed: More High School Graduates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/opinion/needed-more-high-school-graduates.html","abstract":"  Good news: For the third year in a row, more New York City students are staying in school and not dropping out. But there's a catch. Even after spending up to seven years in high school, fewer than 60 percent of students receive a diploma. That poses a real test of Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez's theory that students are more likely to succeed in smaller high schools. It also poses a challenge to his successor: to push the graduation rate up while keeping the dropout rate down.    Deciphering New York's dropout rate has become an annual ritual. In the early 1980's it was calculated to be as high as 42 percent. Since 1986, however, the Board of Education has tracked through graduation the entire group of students entering ninth grade each year.

One psychological advantage of this strategy is that opponents will not easily apply the brakes to their pet schemes, even supposing they have a hunch you are up to something.   The game between the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Gata Kamsky of Brooklyn from Round 10 of the Fourth Miguel Najdorf International Tournament in Buenos Aires shows the 19-year-old American nicely carrying out the Reshevsky stratagem.

It did not seem out of place in a tribute to a distinguished contemporary choreographer. Yet it still resembled a 19th-century ballet. This is because when George Balanchine staged \"Coppelia\" for his company in 1974, he based his production upon that of Petipa and added new choreography of his own in the 19th-century style.

That attitude has rubbed some people the wrong way, but Johnson offers no apologies. The Suns are in the finals, and thanks largely to Johnson's record-setting 62-minute performance in Game 3, the Suns still have a realistic chance at their first title in franchise history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930615","headline":"THE SUPREME COURT: Woman in the News; Rejected as a Clerk, Chosen as a Justice: Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/us/supreme-court-woman-rejected-clerk-chosen-justice-ruth-joan-bader-ginsburg.html","abstract":"  In 1960, a dean at the Harvard Law School, Albert Sachs, proposed one of his star students to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the Supreme Court as a law clerk.

His voice isn't golden; like a rusty old farm implement, it rasps and creaks, moving out of a deep monotone only with great effort. It can be a whisper, a growl, a croak; it suggests deathbed confidences or prophecies from beyond the grave. When Mr. Cohen sings a lover's promises, as he sometimes does, the words sound desperate and ominous.    Mr. Cohen, who is 58, has carried on a remarkably consistent career since his first album appeared in 1967. He writes stately, imagistic songs with zingers every few lines: \"It's lonely here, there's no one left to torture,\" he sings in the title song of his current album, \"The Future\" (Columbia). In early songs like \"Suzanne\" and \"Sisters of Mercy,\" romance and religiosity are intertwined; soon, his concerns about doom and salvation extended beyond the personal sphere, leading to profoundly cynical, black-humored litanies of bad news like \"Everybody Knows\" and \"There Is a War.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930616","headline":"Clinton Dithered.
