The result? The two schools of painting look even less alike than you would have thought if you had thought about it at all.

It was a clear act of defiance toward the international community, which last week voted in the U.N. to intensify sanctions against Haiti to force its illegitimate rulers to step down and allow the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In response, some members of Congress and other observers have begun talking more seriously about the use of military force to oust the coup leaders and allow Father Aristide to return.   That would be a mistake. Mr. Jonassaint's appointment does not materially change the situation in Haiti. The new sanctions, set to begin May 21, should be given a chance to work. The pressure they will exert on the country's rulers will be just as uncomfortable, whether or not they are living under the charade of a legitimate government.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940513","headline":"Mexico Invites U.N. to Attend Election to Observe the Observers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/world/mexico-invites-un-to-attend-election-to-observe-the-observers.html","abstract":"  Trampling an ancient political taboo in pursuit of new legitimacy for Mexico's coming presidential vote, the Government has invited the United Nations to evaluate its electoral system and help organize independent groups of election observers.   In a letter made public on Wednesday night, the Mexican Interior Minister, Jorge Carpizo McGregor, asked the United Nations to play only a limited role in judging the fairness of the balloting scheduled for Aug. 21.

As I worked through my decision, I remembered 14-hour days: running from one room to another and one office building to another because four of my committees were meeting at the same time; lunching just off the Senate floor while waiting for my amendment to come up; dashing to the Capitol steps for photos with three groups from home and back to my office for five appointments on pending legislation or projects -- all followed by three or four hours of returning new phone calls, answering dozens of new letters and reading a pile of urgent action memos from staff members asking directions on issues or constituent problems. Those days usually ended at 10 P.M. with dinner at my desk.   There was no time for reflection, no time to exchange ideas with fellow senators.

Every Saturday afternoon, local teams in the yellow and red of their native Colombia or in the white, black and red of Honduras compete on this dusty field where a rock can change the direction of the ball as surely as a well-placed kick. On one side, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway soars overhead on high trestles, cutting Red Hook off from the rest of Brooklyn. A junkyard stands on a second side, and smokestacks rise from a third, standing witness to the indomitable flowers that grow in this most hardscrabble of fields.   The games are big spectator sport in the neighborhood. Like baseball or basketball, soccer is best watched with food. Around the field is some of the best and freshest street food in New York, sold by families who have simply set up a table and a grill. From all directions, the sizzle of cooking meat cuts through the merengue and salsa music booming from portable stereos, vans and larger amplification devices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940513","headline":"Gift Limits Sought for Attorney General Race","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/nyregion/gift-limits-sought-for-attorney-general-race.html","abstract":"  Challenging her opponents to do the same, Karen S.

For Sergeant Diehl, the moment, with its sense of frenzy and futility, captured perfectly the predicament facing the Police Department's first line of supervision.

A few years ago I made my first visit to the village of Ry, the basis for Yonville, in the Seine-Maritime department, just east of Rouen.

Americans are only beginning to catch up with what this epochal change may imply.   It was widely predicted that the vote in the 517-seat parliament in Strasbourg would be close. In fact, it was a blowout: in the first of four votes, Norway was approved with 374 in favor, only 24 against and 58 abstentions; the approval margins were about the same for the other applicants. This bodes well for the next hurdles, four national referendums, beginning in Austria on June 12 and concluding in Norway on Nov. 26.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Miners All","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/arts/dance-miners-all.html","abstract":"  In addition to the ballets by the three women choreographers participating in the Diamond Project, nine other works will be given premieres.

It shouldn't be a surprise for people to learn -- or remember -- that back in the early 80's, when mountain bikes were first becoming popular, they were promoted here as city bikes.    As a New Yorker and a cyclist who rarely cycles in New York, I've never felt that simply wanting to ride was enough of a reason to haul my bike into the elevator, carry it down the front stairs and into the street and then begin the ongoing abrasive discourse with the urban elements that city cycling requires. Elsewhere people ride bikes expressly for recreation, but New York is a place where a meandering, relaxing spin for its own sake is not just ill-advised; it's probably impossible. There are the circular drives around the various parks, of course, but it seems as though the cyclists there travel only in fast-moving packs, which, for the independent practitioner, turns the enterprise of bike riding into a kind of join-them-or-die proposition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"FILM: The Attack of the Big Summer Movies; Coming Soon: Whatever They Sent Us A Trailer Of","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/movies/film-attack-big-summer-movies-coming-soon-whatever-they-sent-us-trailer.html","abstract":"  AUDIENCES WILL NOT BE surprised to encounter a coming attraction for \"Wyatt Earp\" when they go to see \"Maverick,\" which opens on Friday; both are big westerns with popular stars, and both come from Warner Brothers.

The Polish school of graphic art was noteworthy for its reprise and synthesis of Dada and Surrealism into a symbolic language that was at once playful and subversive. Roman Cieslewicz, a master of the Polish school, reinvigorated prewar Surrealism through his wit and humor. His eclectic typography, at various times influenced by Russian Constructivism, the Bauhaus, Art Nouveau and Art Moderne, and absurdist conceptual collages reminiscent of Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp, helped revitalize a moribund visual culture. Perhaps he was too influential, for Poland allowed him to emigrate to Paris in 1963, where he first took a job as a layout designer and illustrator for Elle, and was soon sought after as a freelance designer of book jackets, posters, advertisements and screen prints. Mr. Cieslewicz did not invent the photo-collage, but judging from his late Polish and later French work he was certainly its pre-eminent modern practitioner. Margo Rouard-Snowman's ROMAN CIESLEWICZ (Thames and Hudson, paper, $29.95) is an extensive catalogue of his best-known pieces -- from the sarcastic covers of the magazine Opus International to the haunting collages about human cruelty that illustrate a 1988 edition of Anatole France's novel \"The Gods Are Thirsty.\" The brief texts at the beginning of each chronological section and an interview with the artist by Ms. Rouard-Snowman, who teaches graphic design at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, tersely explain motives and methods, but the book would be valuable if only for the extraordinary record (from 1955 to the present) of Mr. Cieslewicz's impressive output.

Entering this special room in a stately English country home known as Blatch ards, one discovers that it is green.   In time past, when Lord Vereker's five daughters were in residence, Blatchards was the setting of a great scandal that came to light with a violent death in the Yellow Room. \"Two titles, a Government minister, a kinky tart, the minister's wife\" and sundry others were mixed up in the affair, which involved \"East End criminals, racketeering landlords, a dead body and cricket.\" In time pres ent, a woman and her lover take turns recalling the crime, of which each believes the other guilty.   Like the labyrinthine route one must take to the Yellow Room, the resolution of the mystery is lengthy and winding and delightfully disorienting. Along with the split narrative perspective and the flashbacks, the serpentine plotting that defines the author's elegant style also supports his obsessive theme -- the undying \"ache of irrecoverable time\" that lingers in a place like Blatchards, in a country like England, after a devastating war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Harbor, Harp and Hooded, Seals Are in the Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/nyregion/harbor-harp-and-hooded-seals-are-in-the-sound.html","abstract":"SEALS are coming to Long Island Sound and Connecticut's shore in numbers not seen for centuries.

He said that Mr. Chen was innocent of the smuggling charges and that he had been granted legal-alien status in the United States because of his participation in the pro-democracy demonstrations that Chinese troops crushed in Tiananmen Square in 1989.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/nyregion/connecticut-guide-073776.html","abstract":"  THEME AUSTRALIA   The Wadsworth Atheneum goes Down Under next weekend with programs related to its exhibition of Australian aboriginal art.

The Leafs, who were outshot, 32-21, won the final two games of the Western conference semifinal series. They reached a conference final for the second consecutive year.

Creativity was the order of this golden age. Never had so many dancegoers owed so much to so many choreographers, and never had Americans been exposed to so many kinds of dance and dancers.   A country that lacked the permanent theatrical dance traditions of Europe and Asia suddenly witnessed the emergence of pioneers who became titans in the field. Three of their many achievements were paramount: They freed creativity of the dictates of state or private patronage, of the commercial pressures and utilitarian functions still found in the other arts. They liberated choreography from the historic synthesis of dance, music and painting. They triumphed over the legacy that made dance suspect in America -- a Puritan heritage born in Cromwell's England, where theaters were shuttered and maypole dancing banned.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Apartheid Homelands: A Messy Inheritance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/world/apartheid-homelands-a-messy-inheritance.html","abstract":"  The new parliament building, smelling of freshly polished wood and brass, is abandoned, unlocked and unguarded.

Centuries ago, the strategic location of this Indian Ocean outpost, along with fertile soil, teeming seas and forests of ancient black ebony, made it a sought-after prize among imperial European nations. Successive colonization by the Dutch, French and British, combined with periodic influxes of Indians, Africans and Chinese, has left Mauritius with a wondrous variety of cuisines, languages, crafts and cultures, and a populace whose degree of ethnic diversity is probably unique in an island less than two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. The name Mauritius is Dutch; the island was named in 1598 in honor of Prince Mauritius van Nassau of the Netherlands.  More than half of the population of 1.1 million follows some form of Hinduism. \n\nThe country's official language is English, newspapers are printed in French and more than half a dozen Indian languages are also widely used.
