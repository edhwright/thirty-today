The poor location on his changeup, the sound of Devon White making contact and the sudden explosion of noise inside the Skydome provided Kamieniecki with the information he dreaded. Yes, it was a homer. Yes, the Yankees were about to succumb to the Blue Jays.   After throwing 109 mostly stellar pitches in waging a taut duel with Pat Hentgen into the eighth inning, Kamieniecki misplaced a changeup and White did not miss the mistake. Instead of locating the 2-1 pitch low and outside, Kamieniecki put it high and inside and White popped it off the facade of the second deck in right field for a two-out, two-run homer that elevated Toronto to a 3-1 victory today. In the mistake category, this was a monumental blunder.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940613","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/13/nyregion/chronicle-385271.html","abstract":"  The hottest tickets in town aren't just the Knicks and the Rangers.

Its makeup of 11 Democrats and 9 Republicans encourages bipartisan bargaining. That is why the odd bill proposed last week by its chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, is important.    Viewed as a health care plan, the bill disappoints. It borrows in modified form the President's idea of requiring employers to pay for workers' insurance.

Fusing the 18th century with the 20th, he presided over a religious empire that reached from the back streets of Brooklyn to the main streets of Israel and by 1990 was taking in an estimated $100 million a year in contributions. His \"mitzvah tanks\" -- converted campers that are rolling recruiting stations whose purpose is to draw Jews to the Lubavitch way -- roamed streets from midtown Manhattan to Crown Heights.

In the photographic survey of young stars in Orion, astronomers determined that at least half of them were surrounded by the raw material for planetary formation. The material swirls about the stars in flattened disks of spreading dust, glowing from the reflected light of stars all about the region. Closer analysis showed that the disks contain enough mass to produce Earth-size planets, but no planets have been sighted there.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940614","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/14/nyregion/inside-385956.html","abstract":"  Vowing No More Reprisals   The Air Force Secretary tried to repair relations with a sergeant who says she was punished for testifying before Congress about sexual harassment.

It is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise in North America, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) considers it to be one of the \"most important championships available to the sport\". The trophy was commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club, and winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the two main professional ice hockey organizations, reached an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. It was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19940614","time":"1994-06-14

At times it has been the opposition, meant to illuminate the concept of jazz as experimental and inclusive, which the JVC Jazz Festival hasn't subscribed to. And at others it has been produced under the auspices of the JVC Jazz Festival itself. This year, much to its benefit, the Knitting Factory anticipated the JVC Jazz Festival by a week, and has no connection with that event.   The current What Is Jazz?, which started on Sunday and will run through June 22, is the strongest in years. It presents its own point of view without being reactionary or apologetic. And showcasing performers who straddle the line between jazz-related improvisation and more traditional jazz, the festival makes it clear that a sizable community of musicians exists in that world along with a dedicated audience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940615","headline":"Give Messier a Hand, To Wear His 6th Ring","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/15/sports/stanley-cup-finals-give-messier-a-hand-to-wear-his-6th-ring.html","abstract":"  Mark Messier already owned five Stanley Cup rings, one for each finger of his left hand, when he arrived in New York at the start of the 1991-92 season.
