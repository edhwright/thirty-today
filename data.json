He will decide whether to uphold the commissioner's ruling and also whether the contract represents a circumvention of the salary cap. If he finds a circumvention, the league could fine the Trail Blazers as much as $1 million and force it to forfeit draft choices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"HOUSE PASSES BUDGET PLAN, BACKING CLINTON BY 218-216 AFTER HECTIC MANEUVERING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/us/budget-struggle-house-passes-budget-plan-backing-clinton-218-216-after-hectic.html","abstract":"  After a day of frantic maneuvering to lock up the final votes, the House of Representatives narrowly approved President Clinton's five-year economic plan tonight, putting him on the verge of the most important victory of his young Presidency.

Their union got an injunction last week on grounds that collectors could be hit crossing lanes to get to their booths.

Electronic toll collection involves advance payment by a motorist, who is then issued a small tag to paste inside the windshield. A computer reads the tag each time the car goes through an electronic gate, and deducts the toll from the prepaid account. When an account runs low, the tag-holder replenishes it, or additional payment can be withdrawn automatically from the tag-holder's bank account.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"Delahoussaye Rides His 5,000 Winners Into Hall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/sports/horse-racing-notebook-delahoussaye-rides-his-5000-winners-into-hall.html","abstract":"  Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode A.P.

Regrettably, no comparable sense of environmental stewardship burdens the corporate managers and captains of some of the huge cruise ships that ply America's offshore waters. Conservation groups estimate that of the seven million tons of waste illegally dumped into the oceans, 15 percent can be traced to cruise ships.   Lately, however, tourists with a strong conscience and a talent for undercover work have offered hope. An article in The Times last week reported that Princess Cruise Lines recently paid a record $500,000 fine after pleading guilty to illegal dumping. The crucial evidence was supplied by a Michigan couple, Alvin and Marilyn Levett, who videotaped the crew of the Royal Princess hurling plastic bags into the sea off the Florida Keys. Under a Federal whistle-blowers' program, the couple received half the fine, or $250,000. Two other similar cases are now under Federal investigation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"Manhattan Bars Are Focus in 5 Gay Men's Deaths","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/nyregion/manhattan-bars-are-focus-in-5-gay-men-s-deaths.html","abstract":"  Investigators, still looking for possible links in the deaths of five men whose dismembered bodies were discarded along highways and roadways in three states, have been questioning customers and bartenders at bars and restaurants in New York City where four of the men were last seen.

In sentencing two Los Angeles policemen who savagely beat Rodney King two years ago, U.S. District Judge John Davies said he was not interested in the second issue. He had tried to treat all the participants, he said, \"not as symbols, but as individuals.\"   That's impossible. When a court sentences an offender, he or she becomes a symbol of the consequences of crime. On Wednesday, sentencing Laurence Powell and Stacey Koon to two and a half years in prison and waiving their fines, Judge Davies sent an unfortunate message: that a serious breach of the law by the people who are supposed to enforce it will be treated leniently.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930807","headline":"On Rainy Day, Saberhagen Pitches a Fit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/07/sports/baseball-on-rainy-day-saberhagen-pitches-a-fit.html","abstract":"  Even by the bizarre standards of conduct that have recently been established in the home team's clubhouse at Shea Stadium, Bret Saberhagen's entrance late yesterday afternoon had to raise the eyebrows of his Met teammates.

Telemann even composed a collection of pieces bearing that title.   Of course, we have tafelmusik now as well. It can be heard in elevators, in restaurants, on easy-listening radio stations, even on classical radio stations. The main criterion for the genre is that the music must establish as smooth an interior world as possible; there should be no emotional edges or exclamations to catch attention or distract from the pleasures of dining or conversation. The music should charm, but never demand. It should be solid and reliable. It should always be there when attention wanders from the social occasion, but never deserve or require anything more.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930807","headline":"Driver's Hopes Ride On Improving Trotter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/07/sports/harness-racing-driver-s-hopes-ride-on-improving-trotter.html","abstract":"  The Big Show, as harness racing aficionados call the Hambletonian, is today, and John Campbell will again be at center stage.

If Gerard Mortier's intentions as his successor were in part to diminish the Salzburg cult of personality, he has failed. Uppermost in nearly every conversation in Salzburg these days is Mr. Mortier himself.   The reason is the implacability of his many enemies and the feistiness of his responses. Austrian cultural politics in general are conceived in Manichean terms, the forces of good battling the forces of evil, \"good\" being one's own side, of course.

Whether shot in busy bars and streets or cluttered apartments and dressing rooms, Ms. Goldin's photographs blur the boundaries between public and private, the posed and the exposed. Often details in the background suggest that the photographer's subjects maintain a tense relationship with the larger world: the red AIDS ribbon pinned to Mistress Formica's long-line bra; the police officer who grins benignly at a transvestite while protectively clutching a nightstick; the handwritten signs at a bar advertising drinks to benefit a patron \"hospitalized due to police brutality.\" As Ms. Goldin observes, \"It takes nerve to walk down the street when you fall between the cracks.\" This occasionally somber, often joyous book captures the transvestites' distinctive walk and celebrates their nerve, but never misses a crack.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Van Cliburn Contestant in His Debut at Caramoor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/nyregion/music-van-cliburn-contestant-in-his-debut-at-caramoor.html","abstract":"  THE diversity typical of the musical summer at Caramoor is certainly at hand this week, with two piano programs, a pair of chamber recitals and an evening of jazz.

The first Gouverneur Hospital opened in 1885 in a former public market building at the center of the wide Gouverneur Slip. The three-story city hospital had no operating room and was often surrounded by market wagons that blocked ambulance access. At that time the Lower East side was expanding with European immigration: Martha Frish, a real estate consultant who has studied Gouverneur Hospital, says that the population density reached 330,000 per square mile in the 1890's. Today, says Esther Padlovsky of the Department of City Planning, the density is about 94,000 per square mile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Costa Rica Reopens Inquiry in 1984 Bombing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/world/costa-rica-reopens-inquiry-in-1984-bombing.html","abstract":"  Investigators here are taking a new look at one of the mysteries of Nicaragua's civil war after a newspaper report about a bombing in 1984 that killed four people and wounded a Nicaraguan rebel leader.

Mr. Costas's followers will be pleased to know that his creativity continues in his own restaurant, Kathleen's, in Stamford. Named for his mother (who makes the restaurant's ravishing desserts), it is to be found in the space vacated by Angsavanee East.    The long, two-tier dining room, separated into cozier small areas, has the same brass railings, soft lighting, well-napped tables and stylish look as before. But the walls and accouterments now convey a sense of Americana, with one wall near the entrance suggesting a country cottage. Even the facade, black with bright blue signage and four windowboxes bursting with fresh flowers, generates sophisticated hominess.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Mexico, Argentina and U.S. Represented in Cultural Medley","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/nyregion/art-mexico-argentina-and-us-represented-in-cultural-medley.html","abstract":"  HAVING been founded in 1969 and 1971, respectively, El Museo del Barrio and the Bronx Museum of the Arts both rank as byproducts of the Civil Rights era, but the Bronx institution casts its net wider than its Manhattan sibling.

The practice of integrated pest management can be carried out whether someone tends a half-acre plot or manages the land of a huge wholesale nursery. As a case in point, American Nurseryman recently surveyed wholesale growers. Those who managed as many as 200 acres advocated following some I.P.M. practices in keeping pest populations under control. In fact, 70 percent of the wholesalers who responded to the survey said that they did not apply pesticides on a fixed schedule, while only 30 percent said they did.

Henry Moore, who owned a house here in the 60's and 70's, reveled when he first saw the quarries: \"I was like a little child seeing the window of a sweet shop.\"\n\nPietrasanta, a town of 25,000 in the valley, translates as holy stone. A 14th-century duomo, made of ocher-splotched marble with a characteristic red-brick campanile, opens onto a piazza fringed by Renaissance buildings of mellowed apricot, and assorted open-air studios. Hundreds of sculptors flock here from around the world, stimulated by the sheer quantity of work that goes on. English, German, Dutch, and Swedish can be heard, often in staccato, over the rat-a-tat of chisels. The local artisans can produce anything to scale, and the sculpture laboratories, as they are called, have specialists for every imaginable flourish: angel wings, babies, flowers, small animals, simple clothes and flowing robes. Many laboratories rent space to visiting sculptors; others arrive in town with a model or sketch.

Paper lanterns glowed softly in the trees of the garden, and, as the waiter brought more wine, our friends spoke of the worsening hardships of life in their city: the mounting ethnic tensions, an inflation rate so high that their salaries depreciated in the half hour it took them to cross town and exchange their dinars for hard currency. But even these problems seemed somehow less pressing as we laughed and drank wine and watched our children play soccer in the garden with other children from France, from Germany, from all over Yugoslavia.   Suddenly there was a commotion. A group of gypsy children had run into the cafe. Everyone was screaming, because one tiny gypsy girl had a broken, jagged broomstick and was tossing it like a javelin.

In north Jutland, Gammel Vraa manor was visited for centuries by a naval officer, riding up nightly in a coach drawn by headless horses; not far from Gammel Vraa, at Kokkedal, another legend tells of a knight's daughter, pregnant without benefit of marriage, who was walled into a niche the manor alive and has spent 400 years wandering the premises.   Many Danish manor houses are home to such stories, which people connected to the manors will gladly, even gleefully, relate. But the real ghosts, in a sense, are the manors themselves. Denmark is a fiercely egalitarian country now -- income tax begins at around 50 percent -- so the rich and famous are not so rich here. Manor houses are images of a very different era, the lovely remnants of a fabulous if inequitable past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"'A Quiet Corner Chicken, Sir?'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/style/egos-ids-a-quiet-corner-chicken-sir.html","abstract":"  The demand for good food in the Hamptons has reached an abnormal level.

A Sousa march is pomp and circumstance too: does its playing on the Fourth of July make it democratic?   Politics is an ambiguous term anyway.

Six letter writers and the editor attributed it to eight of the usual suspects: George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, Howard Dietz, Robert Benchley, Ilka Chase, Tallulah Bankhead's husband and Goodman Ace. In another letter in the same issue we found the poet Anthony Hecht upbraiding the novelist Alison Lurie for failing to notice a light-fingered borrowing by the novelist Peter Ackroyd from the poet Wordsworth about some sentimental mist glittering over some plashy earth. This is also missing from Bartlett's -- though the new edition has finally caught up with Evelyn Waugh's far more important plashitude: \"Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole.\"   Pity the editors of any familiar quotations volume. The culture moves so fast these days. Who knows whose bons mots will be borrowed, twisted, misremembered and misattributed in next week's Book Review? John Bartlett himself, having begun in 1855 with the essential smattering of Bible, Shakespeare and mostly English stalwarts, went through nine editions in his lifetime without ever awakening to his contemporaries Whitman, Thoreau or Melville. Today editors have to keep their fingers more tightly on the pulse. Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley have become ancient sages; to capture the words now on our lips and pens, the new edition has felt obliged to canonize less venerable authors like the Doors (\"Come on, baby, light my fire\"), \"Sesame Street\" (\"Me want cookie!\") and Monty Python's Flying Circus (\"This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot\").

It is, quite simply, that Tivoli appeals to all ages.   So, there they were, prams and wheelchairs, arriving punctually as the gardens in the middle of the city opened at 10 A.M. Soon they were joined by mothers trying to control exuberant youngsters, while old men and women strode purposefully through the gardens.

It opens in 1977 and earns a profit of between $20 million and $30 million before closing in 1983. The first attempt at a sequel, \"Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge,\" costs $7 million and closes in 1990 after a tryout in Washington and negative reviews. Abandoned by its producers, \"Annie 2\" evolves into \"Annie Warbucks.\" The show is produced by Karen Walter Goodwin, who tours it around the country in 1992. With a budget of $5.5 million, it is scheduled to open on Broadway in April of this year. But then something happens . . . .  Feb. 19, 1993: The Dream Dies  Karen Walter Goodwin announces that \"Annie Warbucks\" will not make it to Broadway in 1993 for lack of money. March 9: Hold It! The Dream Lives  Ben Sprecher, the co-owner of the 499-seat Variety Arts Theater Off Broadway, calls Martin Charnin, the director of \"Annie Warbucks,\" and offers to produce the musical at his theater. Mr. Sprecher had made an offer once before, but Mr. Charnin, his heart set on Broadway, was unreceptive. This time, he reacts differently. Mr. Sprecher: \"He looked at me. I looked at him. His head went back, and his forehead read 'Tilt!' \"   March 11: They Think They're Gonna Like It Here  The \"Annie Warbucks\" creative team -- Mr. Charnin, the show's lyricist, the composer Charles Strouse and the book writer Thomas Meehan -- inspect the Variety Arts, a theater on Third Avenue near 14th Street that Mr. Sprecher and William P. Miller bought in 1990 and renovated. It opened in the fall of 1991 with \"Return to the Forbidden Planet,\" a science-fiction musical that closed in April 1992. In November the play \"Program for Murder\" lasted less than a month, and the Variety Arts has been dark ever since. But the former porn theater apparently looks right for the redhead. The team agrees on the spot that the show will go on.   May 6: Honey, They Shrunk the Kids  A news conference is called to announce that \"Annie Warbucks\" is alive. In a parody of the Lorenz Hart song \"Where or When,\" Mr. Charnin croons to the assembled journalists, \"It seems we stood and talked like this before . . . The smirk you are smirking you were smirking then.\" A downsized version of \"Annie Warbucks\" will go into rehearsal at the Variety Arts, produced by Mr. Sprecher, Mr. Miller and Dennis J. Grimaldi. The $5.5 million musical will come in at $1 million, with all actors except Harve Presnell (reprising his role of Daddy Warbucks) working for Off Broadway scale. Just how small is it? Mr. Sprecher: \"It's as if you took the Broadway show, threw it in the washing machine in hot water, and it came out about three-quarters the original size.\"  May 10: Attack of the Little People  Many small girls converge on the theater in response to an open call for the orphans. May 26: Dog Day Afternoon  Cindy Lou, a mixed-breed terrier who plays Sandy, gets a second understudy. If Cosmo can't go on, Buby (pronounced Bubba) will. June 10: Mini Annie  First rehearsal. The cast has shed, along with the second chorus, Lauren Gaffney, the stalwart Annie of \"Annie Warbucks.\" Now 13, she is too old and too large. Her replacement is the very small, very young, very loud Kathryn Zaremba, a 9-year-old from Broken Arrow, Okla. \"One of her most endearing qualities, from my point of view, is she isn't even 4 feet tall yet,\" says Mr. Charnin.  July 8: A New Deal for Daddy?  First preview of the show, in which the evil child welfare commissioner, Harriet Doyle (replacing the evil Miss Hannigan), tells Warbucks he has 60 days to find a wife or Annie goes back to the orphanage. Donna McKechnie has signed on as Mrs. Kelly, a possible love interest for Daddy.  Aug. 9: Tomorrow, Tomorrow  \"Annie Warbucks\" is scheduled to open exactly 17 years after the original \"Annie\" opened at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. Mr. Charnin: \"The main thing is, it's going to happen, and I don't have to sit on a stool with hand puppets, which was the plan of last resort.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Lee S.

Until recently, the liability insurance that rental companies are required to maintain by state laws was the primary coverage.    For drivers who do not carry liability insurance or do not want to put their own policies on the line, the rental companies offer an alternative, which they sell under various names for an added daily fee of $8 or so. For those without liability coverage who do not buy this, the renting company's back-up coverage becomes the primary coverage, but there is a possibility that the rental company will turn around and sue the renter.

Athough durable like all cement mixtures, it is not flexible. Cracking of stucco finishes is common and can lead to major damage from water if not repaired.   Most amateurs can fill cracks and repair shallow or small areas of stucco. Large or deep repairs may call for practiced troweling and other techniques. But even those are not too difficult if the work is done patiently and with knowledge. Unfortunately, matching the color and texture of a repair to existing stucco is nearly always impossible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Lisa Wollman, Stuart Kliman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/style/weddings-lisa-wollman-stuart-kliman.html","abstract":"  Dr. Lisa Wollman, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Stuart Wollman of Roslyn, L.I., was married last evening to Stuart D.

But in his new film, opening on Friday, the production designer Stuart Craig faced a particularly difficult task -- finding ways to make \"The Secret Garden\" fresh.   The source material, of course, is Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved story of an orphan whose discovery of a hidden and neglected garden fills her deathly world with life. Published in 1911, the book has spawned adaptations as varied as a Margaret O'Brien film in 1949, a BBC children's special in 1975 and a 1991 Broadway musical. The current version, from Francis Ford Coppola's film company American Zoetrope, was directed by the Polish film maker Agnieszka Holland (\"Europa, Europa\") with a cast including Maggie Smith as the housekeeper and a group of young unknowns. Mr. Craig, accordingly, knew that the secret garden itself -- indeed, the entire look of the movie -- must function as its star; this was a film as much about plants as people, about physical location as a gauge of spiritual growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Union Leaders Fight for a Place in the President's Workplace of the Future","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/us/union-leaders-fight-for-a-place-in-the-president-s-workplace-of-the-future.html","abstract":"  As the Clinton Administration seeks to define the high-performance workplace of the future, union leaders are fighting for a place in that definition.

And if the second thoughts of composers can be overridden, what about those of the people empowered to second-guess them -- especially when the second-guessers are themselves composers?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/books/in-short-fiction.html","abstract":"MIAMI THRILLER \nTHE RAP FACTOR \nBy Delacorta.\nAtlantic Monthly, $18.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Whose Vacation?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/travel/l-whose-vacation-333193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Joyce Maynard's charming piece on travel to London with young children (\"A Lark With Kids in London,\" July 11) reminds me of my own experiences abroad, especially in London and Paris, with toddlers and adolescents. When in Europe with small children, one delightful way to pass the time and see the sights is to use as a guide a favorite storybook, such as \"Babar Loses His Crown\" or \"Paddington Bear.\" In the case of the former, with young Jonny Goldin clutching his own stuffed Babar, five Goldins traipsed from the bateau mouche to the Tour Eiffel to the Opera, everywhere looking for Babar's lost crown, following the book's text as itinerary. In London we retraced Paddington Bear's steps, again using the wonderful children's story as a guide and reading the text on bus rides between destinations. It is a marvelous way to engage children and their imaginations, while seeing the principal sights and interesting points in between. HARRISON J.

Then architecture reversed direction. Since the 1970's, many architects have contrived to put the starch back into buildings. The classical elegies of Michael Graves, the stiff-white-collar modernism of Richard Meier, the overwrought geometries of Peter Eisenman: though these esthetics have assumed vastly different forms, they share an evident antipathy toward the unstructured spaces promoted by modern architecture. Each yearns for a time when it was the architect's job to reinforce social  formalities.   The Temporary Powell Library, a bright balloon of a building that alighted a year ago on the Westwood campus of U.C.L.A., is blithely oblivious to formal dress codes. Designed by the Santa Monica firm Hodgetts & Fung, this ephemeral structure shares common ground with student life. Immensely popular with the university's undergraduates, the Temporary Powell has also become a mecca for visiting architects. Earlier this year, it was honored with an award for design excellence from the American Institute of Architects. With its playful air of spontaneity bolted down by innate rigor, the Temporary Powell revives informality as an architectural ideal. And it raises the question of why that ideal fell from favor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"A Wave of Boardsailors to Hit Beach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/sports/windsurfing-notebook-a-wave-of-boardsailors-to-hit-beach.html","abstract":"  Jayne Fenner, the No. 1 boardsailor in the United States, has seen jams at a starting line before.

It measures the effects of an earthquake at a given location, distinguished from the earthquake's inherent force or strength as measured by seismic magnitude scales. While shaking is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. Deeper earthquakes also have less interaction with the surface, and their energy is spread out across a larger volume. Shaking intensity is localized, generally diminishing with distance from the earthquake's epicenter, but can be amplified in sedimentary basins and certain kinds of unconsolidated soils."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930808","time":"1993-08-08
