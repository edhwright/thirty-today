That bit of wisdom is good to remember as you listen to the demagogues opining that Mexico's debt crisis is Mexico's problem. Mexico owes us $100 billion. That's our problem.   That is frustrating for a lot of people to acknowledge. And they are right to feel frustrated. The $40 billion rescue package that President Clinton has proposed for Mexico is a crazy cross between highway robbery and self-help -- a joint venture by Pancho Villa and Robin Hood.

The Martins ballet, one of the best from the company's artistic director, illustrates perfectly why the concerto structure holds such appeal for choreographers. With its built-in contrast of mood and rhythm, this kind of musical composition gives equal time to both principals and groups. The slow section is invariably used for a pas de deux, a quiet adagio framed by the ebullience of the ensemble's allegro in the first and third sections.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950125","headline":"At the Nation's Table: New Rochelle, N.Y.;\nCooking With Gas, Or Is It Wood?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/style/at-the-nations-table-new-rochelle-ny-cooking-with-gas-or-is-it-wood.html","abstract":"Ira Nevin, 85, pioneered the modern gas-burning pizza oven at the close of World War II.

Webern, far more than Schoenberg or even Berg, was the master colorist of the Second Viennese School. A few string pizzicatos, low sustained tones on the woodwind, high muted cries from the brass, scattered notes on the harp or mandolin: these accumulate into a pointillistic picture of pure, shimmering sound.    Webern died 50 years ago, killed accidentally outside his Austrian home by an American soldier. This year's Focus Festival at Juilliard celebrates both the composer and his musical legacy; the weeklong series began on Friday with a concert by the Juilliard Orchestra at Alice Tully Hall.

Last year, failed labor negotiations truncated the season and canceled the playoffs and the World Series. The owners -- all except Mr. Angelos -- are planning to open this season with replacement players. One of the \"hot\" prospects is the retired pitcher Phil Niekro, age 55. Photographs of last weekend's open tryouts featured players who appeared to waddle around the bases. The Trenton Times recommends that teams made up of bogus players call themselves by names like the Philadelphia Phollies and the Texas Strangers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950125","headline":"Government Urges Testing for Pacemakers With Wiring Problem","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/us/government-urges-testing-for-pacemakers-with-wiring-problem.html","abstract":"  The Food and Drug Administration today advised patients with pacemakers that have potentially defective wiring to undergo X-ray examinations to detect possible fractures in the wires that could lead to severe heart injury or death.

The rocket carried scientific equipment to study the aurora borealis over Svalbard, and flew on a high northbound trajectory, which included an air corridor that stretches from Minuteman III nuclear missile silos in North Dakota all the way to Moscow, the capital city of Russia. The rocket eventually reached an altitude of 1,453 kilometers (903 mi), resembling a US Navy submarine-launched Trident missile. Fearing a high-altitude nuclear attack that could blind Russian radar, Russian nuclear forces went on high alert, and the \"nuclear briefcase\" was taken to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who then had to decide whether to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike against the United States.

But a poll conducted this month by the respected Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton for PBS finds broad, bipartisan support for the very system that many in Congress seem bent on dismantling.   The poll, which sampled 1,005 Americans age 18 and above, reveals an especially deep concern about the declining quality of programming on commercial television; 82 percent believed that commercial television was too violent, especially for young chilren. Nearly 85 percent of the respondents said Congress should either maintain public television's funding at current levels or increase it -- with nearly half of those who responded advocating an increase. Support for public television was broadly bipartisan, reaching 80 percent among Republicans, 86 percent among independents and 90 percent among Democrats. Nine in ten respondents disputed the charge that public television is \"elitist,\" saying that PBS programming offered something for people from just about all backgrounds, regardless of education and income.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950126","headline":"British Royals' Antics Are Hardly New","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/26/opinion/l-british-royals-antics-are-hardly-new-150695.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   A footnote to \"Britons Ask, Whither the Throne?\" (Home section, Jan. 19): You leave an impression of respectability as the norm, disreputability as the exception.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950126","headline":"Close Ones Are Going Against Rangers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/26/sports/hockey-close-ones-are-going-against-rangers.html","abstract":"  The Rangers have opened their season with four games in six nights and they have lost three of them, all by one goal, all at home.

In Spain, the 71-year-old artist is revered as the country's greatest living painter and eminence grise, an artist who weathered the cultural and political drought of the Franco regime without compromising his work. A long list of museum retrospectives attests to the great esteem he inspires throughout Europe.   Mr. Tapies, who was born and has lived nearly all his life in Barcelona, has exhibited regularly in New York City since 1953. His big relieflike paintings, whose pocked and textured surfaces, built up with marble dust and incorporating incised words and symbols and sometimes found objects, suggest ancient urban walls. They are well known here. Yet his work has been overshadowed: by American Abstract Expressionism, by Pop and Minimalism, and also by a parade of his fellow Europeans, from Yves Klein and Joseph Beuys to newer arrivals like Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter and Georg Baselitz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Molissa Fenley Benefit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/theater/molissa-fenley-benefit.html","abstract":"  Philip Glass, Anthony Davis, Diamanda Galas and Stephen Petronio are among the musicians and dancers who are to perform at 8 P.M.  tomorrow at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, in a benefit for Molissa Fenley, the choreographer and dancer.

A measure that passed with near-unanimity in the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly would increase the pensions of both state and city workers, saddling the city with unaffordable recurring costs. The state's new Republican Governor, George Pataki, had supported such a boost when he was courting unions during last year's campaign. But Mr. Pataki reversed himself just after the election -- a prudent response to the state's own budgetary problems and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's strong objections.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Read the Fine Print","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/opinion/read-the-fine-print.html","abstract":"After the elections, the Republicans asked President Clinton for an outright ban on new Federal regulations.

Cuomo and Ann Richards PRODUCER    BBDO, New York City, for Frito-Lay Inc. VISUAL    With the mournful strains of Auld Lang Syne as background music, the scene opens with Mr. Cuomo helping Ms. Richards pack up her gubernatorial office. As she tosses file folders into a cardboard box, they begin to philosophize about the nature of change. When it becomes clear that the change they are discussing is packaging - of tortilla chips, not candidates - Ms. Richards pulls out a newly designed bag of Doritos and Mr. Cuomo begins to munch on a few. SCRIPT    Ms. Richards: \"Mario, I haven't seen a change like this since I was knee high to a June bug.\"    Mr. Cuomo: \"Ann, I was as surprised as you are.\"    A.R.: \"Well, I should have seen it coming.\"    M.C.: \"Maybe so, but now I think we ought to accept this change, embrace it, be positive about it, because change can be very exciting.\"    A.R.: \"You're probably right, Mario. I guess I'll get used to Doritis' new bag.\"    M.C.: \"There you go.\"    Anouncer: \"This year's big change is Doritos. more great taste, brand-new bag.\"    M.C.: \"Too bad about the Cowboys, Ann.\"    A.R.: \"They always won when I was Governor.\" ACCURACY    It is true that both Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Richards are surprised by change. Both thought until the last minute that they would win their elections on Nov. 8. But as is her wont, Ms. Richards is waxing a bit hyberbolic with her assertion that she has not seen such change since she was knee high to a June bug (a large scarab). She has lived through the decline of the beehive hairdo, the Texas oil bust and the stunning emergence of salsa as America's biggest-selling condiment. Mr. Cuomo's advice that change should be embraced is equally suspect. He is, after all, planning to write a book attacking Newt Gingrich's Contract With America as \"plastic populism.\"    Ms. Richards is trying to pull a fast one with her attempt to distance herself from the Dallas Cowboys' loss this year to the San Francisco 49'ers in the National Football Conference title game. Her successor, George W. Bush, was not sworn in until Jan. 17, two days after the game. But Mr. Cuomo has lttle standing to rib Ms. Richards about the Cowboys. His team of choice, the Buffalo Bills lost the Super Bowl each year of Mr. Cuomo's third term, including twice to the Cowboys. SCORECARD    As polticians, these two were always better at belittling their opponents than themselves. During last year's campaign, Mr. Cuomo called the current Governor of New York a \"liar\", while Ms. Richards referred to the current Governor of Texas as a \"jerk.\" But defeat seems to have taught them a lesson, even if the lesson is that a big corporate fee makes self-depreciation far easier to swallow. If this ad helps move Doritos, Frito-Lay may have found the talent it has searched for to replace Dan Quayle, the star of last year's Super Bowl ad for Wavy Lay's potato chips. Expect to see Mr. Cuomo extolling the virtues of \"the family of Fritos\" and Ms. Richards reminding viewers that she was born with a silver chop in her mouth.

His concern with dramatic expression (Albrecht was his great role) rather than academic purity ended his career there and he starred later at the Novosibirsk Ballet, the Young Ballet and especially the Maly Ballet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/arts/art-in-review-415295.html","abstract":"  Beth Haggart   Postmasters Gallery  80 Greene Street  SoHo  Through Feb. 4    Beth Haggart, known for making sculpture out of junk in general and old cardboard boxes in particular, is getting personal.

Mrs. Whitman tells the nation that she and her party stand for smaller government, but the $15.9 billion budget she presented this week is $1 billion more than the last one by the previous Governor, Jim Florio. What's more, her stunning record of income tax reduction has overshadowed its less welcome accompaniment: increases in other taxes in the name of fees and \"closing loopholes,\" and postponement of state expenses through long-term borrowing and the delay of payments to public pension funds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Suspect in L.I.R.R. Shootings Says Eyewitnesses Are Racist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/nyregion/suspect-in-lirr-shootings-says-eyewitnesses-are-racist.html","abstract":"  In a courtroom drama that often bordered on the surreal, Colin Ferguson, who has been diagnosed as paranoid and delusional, presented his own opening statement at his murder trial today, insisting that eyewitness accounts of him killing six people on the Long Island Rail Road were wrong and were motivated by racism. He said that his gun was stolen by the real murderer after he had fallen asleep on the train.   Speaking of himself in the third person, Mr. Ferguson told the jury: \"At the time, Mr. Ferguson, like any other passenger, dozed off. At that point, someone opened his bag, took the weapon out of the bag and proceeded to shoot. Mr. Ferguson was awakened by the gunfire and, amidst the confusion, sought to protect himself, sought to run for cover like any other person on that train.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Uneasy Haitians Await U.S. Pullout","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/world/uneasy-haitians-await-us-pullout.html","abstract":"  Painted slogans demanding that the \"Americans stay for 50 years\" are still appearing on walls around the Haitian capital. But the United States has already decided to hand over its responsibilities here to a United Nations force in two months, and Haitians are finding it difficult to adjust to the new military and political reality that portends.   From senior Government officials down to peasants in the countryside, many Haitians are convinced that the American invasion force that landed here on Sept. 19 is leaving without having finished the job it came to do. Although the United Nations peacekeeping contingent will consist largely of American troops and be led by an American general, there are also questions whether the new international force, operating under a different set of rules, is equal to the challenge it will inherit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950127","time":"1995-01-27
