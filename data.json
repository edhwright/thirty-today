In the 1940's, de Mille was, by her own account, \"the best-known choreographer in America -- not the best, but the best known.\" Dance is a woman's field, but as de Mille pointed out, it was ceded to women only because men didn't consider it important enough to reserve it for  themselves. Furthermore, the area in which she made her deepest mark was not concert dance, the women's preserve, but musical comedy a genre more dominated by men -- men who, furthermore, regarded dancing as employment for the backer's  girlfriends. De Mille's struggle to be taken seriously in that world is a classic women's tale. \n\n      She was born, in 1905, into an eminent family. Her grandfather was the famous economist Henry George; her father, a successful playwright and screenwriter; her uncle, Cecil B. De Mille. As she grew, she developed an excellent mind, a big nose and a rather trying personality -- combative, demanding, complaining. (In later years, several people, without consulting one  another, nicknamed her Agony de Mille.) She spent her teen-age years sitting out the cotillion and writing poems and stories that her father critiqued. He wanted her to be a playwright. He also, she believed, wished she had been a boy, and she undoubtedly wished the same.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"O'Rourke's Raise Draws Much Ire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/o-rourke-s-raise-draws-much-ire.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Snags in Air Crash Inquiry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/world/snags-in-air-crash-inquiry.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Skiing Bolivia Is High Comedy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/travel/skiing-bolivia-is-high-comedy.html","abstract":"CHACALTAYA is Bolivia's only ski resort and, at more than 17,000 feet in altitude, unquestionably the world's highest. Its only run would hardly intimidate the most shrinking of novices if it were, say, three miles lower. But even bunny runs have a way of becoming booby traps the closer they get to outer  space. In this rarefied atmosphere, skiing is no ordinary test of skill. \n\n     Chacaltaya is an oval glacier blanketing a velvet hill on the Cordillera Real, the eastern of the two Andean ranges in Bolivia. It is 15 miles north of La Paz and visible from the upper reaches of the city. But its geographical proximity belies a nerve-racking 90-minute drive along roads that could induce vertigo in a condor. By comparison, the Matterhorn is 2,500 feet lower, and no one bothered to build a ski run there.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING;Morrison Suspended Just Before Fight","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/sports/sports-people-boxing-morrison-suspended-just-before-fight.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"After a Dismal '95, Small Markets Surge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/business/after-a-dismal-95-small-markets-surge.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"DINING OUT;Rustic Digs, Live Music, Eclectic Menu","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/dining-out-rustic-digs-live-music-eclectic-menu.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Votes in Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/votes-in-congress-036927.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/no-headline-037257.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"The Official G.I.'s Guide to Staying Out of Trouble","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/weekinreview/the-official-gi-s-guide-to-staying-out-of-trouble.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Week in Review"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"IN BRIEF;Casino Addition to Preserve Historic Theater's Facade","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/in-brief-casino-addition-to-preserve-historic-theater-s-facade.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Phone Scarcity Complicates Fire Alarm Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/phone-scarcity-complicates-fire-alarm-plan.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"MAIN STREET, JAPAN: For Better or for Worse;Who Needs Love!

Red lights mean stop. Green lights  mean go. But it's more complicated on Washington Street, where traffic lights are few and far between. There are no lights on Washington between Bethune and Christopher Streets, a distance of six blocks. \n\n     Twenty years ago, when the far West Village was still overwhelmingly industrial, the dearth of lights was not a hot issue. But today, the area has evolved into a mixed-use and residential neighborhood with thousands more residents. The growing numbers of popular restaurants are drawing more people and cars to the neighborhood. And more drivers are using Washington Street instead of the often-jammed West Side Highway. Traffic is likely to increase when the highway, known formally as Route 9A, is reconstructed as an urban boulevard starting in the spring.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Southampton Fearp Changes Planned for L.I.R.R.

The white squall of the title -- a rare and dreaded freak of nature -- is brilliantly recreated, a tantrum that we can barely conceive of, an act of wind and water that claims the ship, the captain's wife, another crew member and four students. The storm is so violent and sudden it is deemed a fantasy in the  courtroom scene that ends the film: a courtroom scene in which the captain is charged with failing to adequately command his boat. \n\n     Many sea sagas seem to end in courtrooms, and the reason is clear. Audiences  need a debriefing on dry land after the unimaginable isolation of that different race and government of sailors at sea.

In \"American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword,\" Seymour Martin Lipset motes that while the United States is the most litigious society in the world -- spending four to eight times as much on lawsuits as Germany, England, Italy, France, the Netherlands or Japan -- it is simultaneously one of the most lawless, vexed by crime rates triple those of other industialized nations. Hence America's double-edged sword: on one side of  the blade, \"a high sense of personal responsibility, independent initiative and  voluntarism\"; on the other side, \"self-serving behavior, atomism and a disregard for communal good.\" \n\n      Central to Mr. Lipset's American exceptionalism is the idea of a definable American Creed, \"a set of dogmas about the nature of a good society,\" deriving mostly from the Revolution. These include liberty, egalitarianism (defined as equality of opportunity, not result), individualism, populism and laissez-faire. To buttress his argument, he uses copious survey data to demonstrate how different America is from other advanced countries. For example, in 1992 just 38 percent of Americans agreed that government should reduce the difference in income between rich and poor, compared with 65 percent of Britons, 66 percent of West Germans and 80 percent of Italians.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Proving to Mr. Dithers That It's Time for a Raise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/business/proving-to-mr-dithers-that-its-time-for-a-raise.html","abstract":"CATHY HOOT used to subscribe to the Dagwood Bumstead theory of getting a raise: throw yourself at the boss's mercy.

For years my husband  and I wanted to live in Venice, not just visit -- but the monthlong rentals listed in the brochures we had received from several American real estate brokers were beyond our price range. Luckily we had found several brokers in Venice on previous visits. Their faxed replies to our inquiries were charming, and spoke of slightly cheaper, more intriguing options: \"The apartment is very nice, with furniture in Style. There is also a washdisher.\" \n\n     Though we would fantasize about the charms of these apartments (the dangerous benefit of having no brochure), we hesitated to commit money to a sight-unseen -- even a month is a long time to be stuck with a mistake. Most of the Venetian  brokers gave up after a letter or two, but one -- Chiara Canal, of Gestioni Finanziarie Immobiliari -- kept trying. So on a gray day last spring, when we spied a cheap air fare to Italy, we faxed Chiara one last time. If she had a place on the Grand Canal, we'd go for just a week to see what our choices for a  month's stay really were.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Building Homes, and Skilled Developers, in Brooklyn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/realestate/building-homes-and-skilled-developers-in-brooklyn.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"SPOTLIGHT;For Love Alone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/tv/spotlight-for-love-alone.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"GOLF;Nicklaus's Next Open Is to Be His Last","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/sports/golf-nicklaus-s-next-open-is-to-be-his-last.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"At the Apollo, Past Meets Future","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/style/at-the-apollo-past-meets-future.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"ART;At Yale Gallery, Buddhist Works From Asia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/art-at-yale-gallery-buddhist-works-from-asia.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Connecticut Q&A: William J.

By Anthony Walton. Illustrated. 279 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24.    TO understand the world, William Faulkner once said, you have to understand a place like Mississippi. Anthony Walton began working on this fine and brave book five years ago, when he was 30. In his incessant confrontations with racism in the North, he was having doubts about whether he wanted to be an American. He was too contentedly bourgeois, he confesses, to look toward Africa, and besides  did not know his tribe. The more he thought, the less he could deny it: \"I was from somewhere. Mississippi was my heritage and background, and if I wanted to decipher the tangle of contradictions and illusions around me, I was first going to have to learn to decipher myself.\" He adds: \"If I was going to have to live out the fate of being black and American, I felt I needed to know what that meant.
