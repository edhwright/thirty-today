A fan leaped from the right-field seats, ran over to Jordan and hugged him. On Jordan's first at-bat in the eighth against left-hander Rich Rodriguez, he hit a chopper to third baseman Jerry Browne, who tried to backhand the ball,but couldn't. Jordan was credited with a hit.

That bill -- the city's version of an even more modest state law decontrolling luxury apartments -- is hardly adequate reform, but it is at least a first step in the right direction.   Real reform is politically impossible, considering the influence the renters' lobby has with elected officials.

The group, three of whose members are sons of the famous flamenco singer Jose Reyes, makes passionate folk-pop music that takes the flamenco tradition as its stylistic base and stirs in contemporary instrumentation and international flavors. At Radio City Music Hall, where the group (augmented to 11 from 7) opened a two-evening engagement on Friday, the Gipsy Kings showed that dilutions of their essential style can be carried only so far before that style begins to lose its potency    Much of the power of flamenco lies in the tension between the rigidity of its musical form and its tradition of packing explosive, ornamental guitar improvisations into very small spaces. The group's principal soloist, Tonino Baliardo, is brilliant at it. And its lead vocalist, Nicolas Reyes, who sings mostly in Gitane, a Gypsy dialect that is a mixture of Spanish and French, has the urgency of a soul singer pushing his voice to its physical limits. His melismatic flourishes, which imitate flamenco's fluttering, tremulous guitar lines, have a raw, emotional vibrancy that suggests a passion barely under control and tinged with a fatalistic foreboding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940321","headline":"Why Do North Korea's Neighbors Look So Calm?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/21/opinion/IHT-why-do-north-koreas-neighbors-look-so-calm.html","abstract":"The big news this week from Northeast Asia is not the latest nuclear-tipped wrangling between Pyongyang, Washington and Seoul.

For the first time in nearly a century there was no parade. Its organizers, a veterans group, had canceled the procession after the state's highest court ruled that a gay grouphad the right to be included.   To South Boston, which has felt under siege ever since court-ordered busing for school integration began 20 years ago, it was yet another assault by outsiders. But some things don't change, and one of them is Billy Bulger's St. Patrick's Day luncheon at the Bayside Club. Mr. Bulger, who rose from a South Boston housing project to become not just the state senate president but one of the most powerful men in the state, presided today, as he has for 28 years.    And for a few hours in a packed, overheated old tavern, with Mr. Bulger singing Irish songs and roasting his friends and foes over boiled corned beef and cabbage and green ice cream, this St. Patrick's Day was like all the others. On this day Senator Edward M. Kennedy, United States Representative Joe Moakley, Gov. William F. Weld (one of only a few Republicans, and a token Yankee to boot) and Mayor Thomas M. Menino, along with dozens of state and city legislators, put on their green ties and made the journey over the bridge and across Fort Point Channel to South Boston.    So did Bob Sances, a guy from the neighborhood who made good -- he is an engineer -- and moved to the suburbs, but still returns to see his old friends from M and Seventh Streets. \"Finally, after all these years I got in,\" Mr. Sances said, taking his place at a long table festooned with green cloth napkins and pots of clover. \"I grew up with Billy Bulger. He's a very deep thinker. He doesn't like to talk to the press.\" The senate president reads Latin and Greek, and he doesn't hold press conferences.    Mr. Sances added, with some pride, \"I came in the V.I.P. door.\" It was the only door. To get there, the 600 or so invited guests had to climb the rickety fire escape. Mr. Sances was lucky. He got a chair, one of 200.    At 10:45 A.M. President Clinton himself was on the telephone. \"I know that this morning I'm just the other President on the phone,\" he said to Mr. Bulger, with his remarks amplified over the public address system.    Mr. Bulger said, \"I commend you for your humility.\"    While Mr. Bulger and the former Mayor, Raymond Flynn, who is now the Ambassador to the Vatican, are both from South Boston, they have never been close. \"It's great you appointed Ray Flynn to the Vatican,\" Mr. Bulger said to Mr. Clinton. \"It shows you have a great sense of humor.\" Later in the conversation, he added: \"You were kind to take him from us.\"    Towering over the compact Mr. Bulger, Governor Weld, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall, stood by, waiting for a word with the President.   The President from Hope, Ark., and the president from South Boston joked about Mr. Weld's patrician roots, his house in Cambridge (viewed as an elitist foreign country by South Boston), and his zeal for squash.    \"Oh, does he love squash,\" said Mr. Bulger, who keeps trim by running on a treadmill. \"It's a real class thing. I never played squash. No one around here ever played squash.\"    Mr. Clinton told Mr. Weld: \"Your family came over here on the Mayflower and went to Plymouth Rock. My family came to Arkansas in a Plymouth pickup and went to work for Mayflower Van Lines.\"    The crowd loved it.    And so it went, with more jokes, and lots of singing, for three hours. Toward the end, the podium was taken by John Hurley, president of the Allied War Veterans Council of South Boston, which canceled the parade after the state's highest court ruled it could not ban the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston from marching.   Mr. Bulger, who married his high school sweetheart, Mary, and raised nine children in South Boston, reminded his guests that community mattered more than anything. \"The South Boston parade belongs to South Boston,\" he said. And he led the room in a rousing chorus of an old neighborhood anthem, \"Southie Is My Hometown.\"    Back across the bridge, the Irish-American gay group that was not a part of Southie's traditions had its own St. Patrick's Day party, at the Arlington Street Church.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940321","headline":"Reforms in Mexico Put in Doubt By Opposition of Leftist Leader","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/21/world/reforms-in-mexico-put-in-doubt-by-opposition-of-leftist-leader.html","abstract":"  As the Mexican Congress prepares to take up the most significant proposals for democratic change since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office five years ago, the outcome has been thrown into doubt by a split in the country's strongest opposition party.

The title is decided by a head-to-head match. But if any tournament could be likened in prestige to the championship, it would be the Linares International in Spain, which finished on March 14 with a remarkable result: Anatoly Karpov of Russia, who lost the world title to his countryman Gary Kasparov in 1985, finally got revenge by running away with first place in Linares with a whopping 11-2 score, 2 1/2 points ahead of his nemesis, who tied for second.   Karpov got a $7,000 prize, an amount rumored to be just a fraction of what he was paid to appear at this elite event. But whatever the total secret sum might be, it could not have given the 42-year-old Karpov anywhere near the satisfaction of getting out of Kasparov's shadow for once. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . .

Even if the tenant does not move out, the rent protections disappear when the lease expires if the tenant makes more than $250,000 a year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940322","headline":"Everglades: Paradise Not Quite Lost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/22/science/everglades-paradise-not-quite-lost.html","abstract":"  AT first glance, the Everglades gives no obvious hint that even though it remains one of the world's superlative ecosystems it is sorely in need of restoration.

The setting is a shtetl near the eastern border of Poland (the film was shot in a real shtetl in Ukraine), but the imagery has a peculiar and incongruous glamour. Life is languid and slow. Characters are voluptuous, even when the realities of their existence are ominous and harsh. In this atmosphere, a wife responds amorously when her husband embraces her, even though she happens to be busy scrubbing the floor.   Ms. Zauberman uses this intoxicating manner to tell the story of Abraham (Roma Aleksandrovitch), his family and his neighbors, who reflect varying political changes that are in the offing. Nachman (Rolan Bykov), Abraham's grandfather, is the estate manager for a brooding, world-weary Prince (Oleg Iankovski) who presides over the region until his money runs out.

At least one-fourth of those who were unable to cross in time were left stranded by at least one lane of traffic, according to a report in the current issue of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.   In the study, Dr. Russell E. Hoxie and Dr. Laurence Z.

But the play's most affecting moment is a quiet one. Three teen-age boys of disparate social backgrounds have just witnessed a murder. And the bold adult postures they have been trying to maintain, in emulation of both baseball heroes and James Bond villains, have slipped off like oversize jackets. Their silence and their hunched, embryonic postures are resonant with fear and a sense of futility.

But a lack of awareness and vigilance can sometimes result in acute injuries or chronic exposure to a more distant danger. For example, some years ago a kindergarten child who had spilled paint was told by his teacher to clean it up with turpentine. The child, whose clothing became saturated with this toxic solvent, developed a red, scald-like rash over most of his body and within a week was having seizures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940323","headline":"John J.
