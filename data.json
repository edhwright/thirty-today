Buck Williams, the former Net, needed 1 point to reach the 15,000-point career plateau. He got it quickly, scoring the opening basket for the Blazers to become the 10th player in N.B.A. history to accumulate more than 15,000 points and 11,000 rebounds.   Sacramento has lost 22 consecutive games at Portland.

Kirovski's goal was set up when defender Marcelo Balboa passed to Mike Sorber in the left side of the penalty box. Sorber redirected the ball to Kirovski, who kicked the ball into the upper left corner of the net. Honduras took a 1-0 lead in the 68th minute on a goal by Wilmer Velasquez.

Moe placed second yesterday in the season's opening Super-G with a time of 1 minute 22.58 seconds in Tignes, France.

Mr. Reznor's success (Nine Inch Nail's second full-length album went to No. 2 on the pop charts this year, and he was voted one of the 10 sexiest rockers by Playgirl magazine) comes at a strange time, almost a decade after the style of music he plays flourished.    His appearance and attitude -- from his jet-black hair, all-black clothing and pasty white skin to his lyrics about being miserable, godless and suicidal -- come straight from gothic rock, the dark and bleak musical cult that gathered around 1980's bands like Bauhaus and Sisters of Mercy. Mr. Reznor's music is nearly identical to that of the hard-edged electronic dance bands that peaked creatively at the same time, groups including Cabaret Voltaire, Ministry and Nitzer Ebb, who mixed industrial noise with disco beats.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941212","headline":"1894: Autocratic Czar : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/12/opinion/IHT-1894-autocratic-czar-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - [The Herald says in an editorial:] Nicholas II is beginning to manifest his intentions on the subject of the internal policy of his Empire.

It is scheduled to meet tomorrow for the last time to vote on a plan by its chairmen -- Senators Bob Kerrey and John Danforth -- to cut Federal spending by enough to keep the deficit from claiming a larger share of the economy over the next 35 years. That is the right goal. But their proposed solution is misguided, and has no chance of garnering enough votes.    The failure is sobering. Mr. Kerrey is right that entitlements, programs like Social Security and Medicare for which spending is driven by formula rather than annual decisions by Congress, pose a huge budget problem. They, along with interest payments, are expected to account for over 70 percent of Federal spending by the year 2003, leaving crumbs for everything else. Addressed now, the solutions need not be onerous. Left to fester, they could prove horrific. But as Mr. Kerrey observes, Washington displays little stomach for tackling a problem that will not bite soon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941213","headline":"Ant and Its Fungus Are Ancient Cohabitants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/13/science/ant-and-its-fungus-are-ancient-cohabitants.html","abstract":"  THEY are tiny mandibled versions of Shiva, the Hindu god of devastation and restoration.

By whatever name, all 24 were played by the pianist Vladimir Feltsman at the 92d Street Y on Sunday afternoon.   The point would be niggling were it not for the noticeable differences between Bach's first and second efforts.

In this 1945 work, which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Monday evening after an 11-year absence, certainties are few and ambiguities abound. That puts it in sharp contrast to most of the Met's fare, operas in which heroes are heroes and villains are villains. Given the straightforward simplicity of Tyrone Guthrie's 1967 production and a strong cast that comes to the music with original, if sometimes debatable, interpretive ideas, this \"Grimes\" makes an unusually provocative evening of theater.   Mainly, it keeps one guessing about Britten's intentions. Grimes, a gruff Suffolk fisherman whose young apprentices are prone to fatal accidents, stands defiantly apart from a hypocritical, oppressive society. Britten identified strongly with that, and there is a degree to which Grimes is shown as that quintessential 19th-century loner-hero, the misunderstood artist. \"I can see the shoals to which the rest are blind,\" Grimes declares, striking the classic pose of the Romantic artist glimpsing truths beyond mortal vision.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"The Pop Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/arts/the-pop-life-105074.html","abstract":"  Down Time for Etheridge    Melissa Etheridge has been on the road for a year and a half without a break.

That program raised the question, echoed tonight, of whether the efforts to save Mr. Otey were a tribute to America's justice system or a waste of time and resources.   In 1978, Mr. Otey was convicted of the murder of a 26-year-old Nebraska woman, largely on the basis of his graphic description of how he had stabbed and smothered her and then hit her a few times with a hammer just to be sure she was dead. Later he said the confession had been coerced, but his volunteer lawyer, who is at the center of tonight's account, does not take that tack. Granting that his client might have done the deed, Victor Covalt argues that Mr. Otey should live because in his years on death row he studied philosophy and wrote poetry and was now a different man from the one who murdered Jane McManus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941214","headline":"In TV Age, Fifth Graders Fall in Love With the Written Word","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/nyregion/in-tv-age-fifth-graders-fall-in-love-with-the-written-word.html","abstract":"  Something extraordinary happens every day in Kathleen Tolan's fifth-grade classroom at Public School 125, the Ralph J.

Yet the sheer oddity of the whole affair left one in a kind of daze. There was the shouting match that broke out in the balconies immediately after the concert began; there was the perplexing presence of Ursula Oppens, the formidable new-music specialist, as accompanist; there was the fluctuating quality of the soprano's own voice, alternately beautiful and bland. Whatever it was, it wasn't dull.   This was Miss Battle's second recital in New York since her abrupt dismissal from the Metropolitan Opera last February. Her operatic engagements have dwindled markedly in the last few years, and it would seem that the notoriously temperamental soprano is concentrating her energies on solo recitals.

They are 6-8, they have lost their last three games and they need an improbable set of circumstances to occur just to qualify for the playoffs. In many respects, their season died during that fourth quarter comeback engineered by Miami's Dan Marino at Giants Stadium three weeks ago.
