Peter Delaney, Mr. Pataki's nominee for General Services Administrator, a job that manages the state's office space and its $2 billion purchasing operations, has been doing essentially the same job in Westchester County for five years. But he has a dubious track record of leasing expensive office space -- sometimes unneeded office space -- from G.O.P. contributors to the County Executive, Andrew O'Rourke, a Republican.

Instead, a more moderate rival, conceived and nurtured in part by conservative Democrats, has the best chance of winning House approval, and perhaps the Senate's too, as part of the balanced budget amendment. When the House Judiciary Committee voted on Tuesday to approve such an amendment, the three-fifths requirement for tax increases was part of it. But in an interview yesterday, a senior Republican aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said that such a hurdle to future tax increases \"ain't gonna fly.\" SENATE -- The Senate began debate on legislation that would reshape relations between Federal and local governments, making it harder for Washington to impose rules on cities and states without helping pay the costs. But the opening debate took longer than the Republican majority had planned, as some Senators cautioned against hasty votes on something they do not yet fully understand, and indeed Democrats won some extra time to develop several amendments limiting the measure's scope. \"There is still some confusion, frankly, among a lot of members as to exactly how it will work,\" said Senator William S.

Reared in Harlem during its cultural flowering and trained in art, Mr. Lawrence had by the age of 20 evolved a slightly archaic, Cubist-inflected style that held abstraction and representation in perfect balance.

Mr. Lawrence's activities did not go unnoticed: his work was exhibited not only in group shows but also in two solo shows, and he received a Rosenwald Fund fellowship.

Beginning tomorrow he'll get one. \"True Fiction Pictures: A Hal Hartley Retrospective\" (True Fiction is the name of Mr. Hartley's production company) will run through Jan. 29 at the museum, in Astoria, Queens. It begins tomorrow at 2 P.M. when Mr. Hartley will introduce \"Simple Men,\" the mordant story of two brothers who set out to find their long-lost father, accused of tossing a bomb at the Pentagon 25 years before. As in all Hartley films, the plot is a device for droll dialogue, deadpan characters and delicious grace notes. Where else would a nun and a policeman wrestle in the middle of a dirt road over a medal of the Blessed Virgin?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950113","headline":"Letterman to Be Oscars Show Host","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/13/movies/letterman-to-be-oscars-show-host.html","abstract":"  David Letterman will be the host of the Academy Awards telecast this year, the first purely television star to fill that role since Johnny Carson handled the job in the 1970's and 80's.

It was cozy there with the big Art Deco fixture overhead shedding just enough light to allow the woman across from me to read a magazine. Next to her, a man sat mumbling over a book about saltwater fish, occasionally angling the book to catch some light from the chandelier above the bar. When his companion arrived, he put the book down, ordered a martini and began discussing his last meal at the restaurant. By the time he was finished describing five-spice grilled squab and steamed lobster with Penang curry, his friend was insisting on staying for dinner.   To do that they had to leave the warmth of the bar and move to the far reaches of the large open room. Aja, an oddly decorated space, offers a new definition of the term eclectic. Part Victorian, part Art Moderne, part modern, the barn of a room is an uncomfortable mush of styles that combine open ducts and chandeliers. That's fine with me, but I wish the Shaker element were not the chairs (hard and uncomfortable) and the modern element were not the sound level (extremely high).

After 10 years of honoring rock's pioneers and innovators with a night of improvised jams, confessional speeches and other surprises, it is turning into a ritual that one day may be as formal, as rigid and as respected as the Grammys. The fact that in September a giant shrine of steel and glass called the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is to open in Cleveland will add more prestige and convention to the ceremony, which is scheduled to move from New York to Cleveland in 1997.   While an annual event like this is a positive achievement for rock-and-roll, it's important that the Hall of Fame's big night not lose the spontaneity and energy that defines the music it celebrates. In ceremonies past, the speeches were followed by jam sessions where anything could happen, and usually did.

Kennedy and Newark International, which are operated under long-term leases by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. If privatization means bringing in private management to do a better job, it is worth exploring. But outright sale would be foolish. Responsible officials need firm control over facilities that are central to the area's role as a hub of national and international commerce and travel.   The question comes up because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governors George Pataki and Christine Todd Whitman, all Republicans, are bent on having private interests take over public services wherever possible, and are all strapped for cash.  The Mayor and the Governors have separate official interests. The cities of New York and Newark own the airport land. The Governors, watched over by Port Authority bondholders, jointly control the Authority and thus the airport management. But overriding their parochial perspectives, all three should have one paramount concern -- the quality and capacity of these facilities. Ranked among the world's principal airports, they are and will continue to be key to the region's growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/nyregion/news-summary-702995.html","abstract":"  International 3-6  CLINTON CHIDES RUSSIA ON ATTACK    President Clinton broke his silence about the Russian attack on a secessionist region, urging that the military action be halted but saying that aid to Russia should not be cut back because of the crisis. 1","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"Japanese Tire Maker Clashes With Labor Chief Over Strike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/us/japanese-tire-maker-clashes-with-labor-chief-over-strike.html","abstract":"  Over the past week, the head of the American operations of the giant Bridgestone Corporation of Japan has rebuffed repeated appeals from Labor Secretary Robert B.

Set in an antiseptic-looking diner (designed by Ms. Mosakowski) that recalls the futurist fantasies of the 1960's, the one-hour play assembles four characters of allegorically significant professions who make the disenfranchised boozers of \"Iceman\" seem rock solid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"63 Teams Taking Part in Meet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/sports/sports-people-high-schools-63-teams-taking-part-in-meet.html","abstract":"  Tomorrow's Archbishop Molloy Games, a track and field meet at the Armory, features a 63-team field from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia.
