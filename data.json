The man, William Washington, who has no known address, was arrested shortly after the attack, which occurred about 8 A.M. on Wednesday on the hospital's 12th floor, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a spokeswoman for the New York City Police Department. Mr. Washington entered the hospital last Monday, but the police did not know why he was hospitalized.

No wonder Americans are uneasy about playing \"designated hitter for the United Nations,\" as Senator Trent Lott recently put it.    But these setbacks do not invalidate the notion of collective action. It will generally be preferable for the United States to contribute troops, logistical support or financing to an effective peacekeeping force than to play global cop by itself.

He was betting that he could outscore his rivals against the field, and time after time he was proved right.   For a long time now, the Capablanca policy has been successfully used by strong players, principally by such cautious souls as Tigran Petrosian, the Soviet Armenian who was world champion from 1963 to 1969. Most recently it was put into effect by the Worcester, Mass., grandmaster Ilya Gurevich in the Winter Tournament of the Marshall Chess Club, at 23 West 10th Street. In this event, which ran from Jan. 31 to Feb. 13, Gurevich went undefeated in amassing the winning 8-3 score. Against his fellow grandmasters, he drew in 12 moves with Roman Dzindzichashvili of Queens and in 22 moves with John Fedorowicz of Manhattan. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . Country . . . Points . . .

Against the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defense with 3 Nd2, Klovsky adopted 3 . . . Nf6 to lure the white center on with 4 e5. Quite soon, he whittled down this bastion with 8 . . . f6 9 ef Nf6 which also gave him the mobility to defend his kingside.   After 10 Ne2, it may be that Black does not need 10 . . . Qc7. A reasonable alternative is 10 . . . Bd6 11 O-O O-O 12 Bf4 Bf4 13 Nf4 Ne4 14 Qc1 Ng5 15 Ng5 Qg5 16 Ne2 Qf6.   The plan underlying 10 . . . Qc7 is that after 11 . . . Bd6, White cannot exchange off his queen bishop against the black king bishop. The purpose is further served by 14 . . . Nh5, which prepares 15 Bg3 Ng3 16 hg, thus preserving the d6 bishop to guard the slightly weak dark squares.   Gurevich remarked that his 17 Nb6!? is a new move. On 17 . . . Ra7, the black queen rook is out of play, while after 17 . . . Rb8, Gurevich boldly snatched a pawn with 18 Ba6!?   Klovsky did not knuckle under with 18 . . . ba 19 Rc6, nor fall into 18 . . . Nb4 19 Bb5 Na2 20 Rc8 Rbc8 21 Nc8 Rc8 22 Qa4! Nb4 23 Bd7, which wins a decisive pawn and simultaneously unhinges the black position. He struck back with 18 . . . Nd4 19 Nd4 ba 20 Nc8 Rbc8 21 Rc8 Rc8, when 22 Ne6? would be crunched by 22 . . . Qe5!, winning a piece.   Still, Gurevich's analysis had gone a lot farther, as his 22 Re1! showed. After 22 . . . Bb4 (22 . . . e5? 23 Nf5! gf 24 Qd5 Qf7 25 Qd6 is overwhelming for White) 23 Qg4! Qf7 24 Rd1, there was no defense by 24 . . . Re8 because of 25 Ne6 Qe6 26 Qb4.   On 24 . . . Ng7 25 Ne6! Rc4 26 Nd4 Nf5, Gurevich coolly forced the game into a pawn-ahead ending with 27 b3 Rd4 28 Rd4 Nd4 29 Qd4.   After 38 Qb7!, there was no use for the Ukrainian to go on: 38 . . . Qg8 39 f4 Kh6 40 Qg7 Qg7 41 Bg7 Kg7 42 Kf2 brings about an elementary king-and-pawn ending; 38 . . . d4 39 Bd4 Qe1 40 Kg2 accomplishes nothing because Gurevich had precisely guarded against 40 . . .

The stand-up comedy in this concert film is raunchy, sexually graphic, intermittently funny and, because of a ratings skirmish, already semi-notorious. When the film was given an NC-17 rating, it was dropped by its distributor, Miramax. It is now being released without a rating by the Samuel Goldwyn Company.    But Mr. Lawrence has higher ambitions than to throw street language and sexual gestures at mainstream audiences. In \"You So Crazy,\" he creates a blunt comedy of hip-hop manners, and politeness has nothing to do with it. He paces around the stage, slipping easily and impressively in and out of many voices, accents, walks and faces. He imitates Hispanic people commiserating with blacks about the treatment of Rodney King (\"The way they beat Rodney Dangerfield was bad\"). He plays both parts in a conversation between a man and a woman trapped, through every fault of their own, in a bad relationship. And in his half-minute version of \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" he kicks old Daisy out of the car. That's the demure part.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940427","headline":"Let the '50s Shine : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/opinion/IHT-let-the-50s-shine-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"A Darker View of the '50s on a Desperate 'Carousel'\" (Opinion, April 1) by Frank Rich:.Probably the reason Lincoln Center audiences begin crying as soon as they hear \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" has less to do with the sensi","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940427","headline":"A Step Toward Gift Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/opinion/a-step-toward-gift-reform.html","abstract":"  Yesterday the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee took an important step toward cleaning up a long-festering Congressional scandal: the gifts that lobbyists and other powerful interests give to lawmakers.

As golfers take to the green, tennis players to the courts, baseball players to the field, swimmers to the water and do-it-yourselfers to the paint brush and tree-trimmer, many also take it on the shoulder. For while the shoulder is the body's most talented joint, it is also inherently unstable and, after the knee, it is the most vulnerable link between bone and bone.   Yet few know how to care for this important joint, which plays a crucial role in a host of routine tasks, like combing the hair, turning a doorknob, carrying a briefcase and writing a letter. All too often, the first hints of shoulder problems are ignored or mistreated, leading to a much more serious, painful and longer-lasting injury. Knowing how to recognize the early signs of trouble and how to strengthen and stretch the shoulder joint to increase its resistance to injury can save misery down the line. Vulnerable Joint    Dr. John M. Fenlin, an orthopedic surgeon affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia who has devoted his career to the shoulder, describes it as \"a very elegant joint,\" with both great power and great mobility.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940427","headline":"4 Defendants Ask Lawyers Be Changed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/nyregion/4-defendants-ask-lawyers-be-changed.html","abstract":"  With a week to go before sentencing, all four men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing have dismissed their defense lawyers and asked to be represented by William F.

Judge Duffy said he made his decision because the two lawyers are defending two of the men in a related terror conspiracy trial to begin in September. The judge argued that a potential conflict of interest exists for a lawyer to represent defendants in both cases. Life Terms Expected    The four defendants -- Mohammed A. Salameh, Nidal A.

They are distinct from by-elections, which fill a seat that has become vacant between general elections. In most systems, a general election is a regularly scheduled election, typically including members of a legislature, and sometimes other officers such as a directly elected president. General elections may also take place at the same time as local, state/autonomous region, European Parliament, and other elections, where applicable. For example, on 25 May 2014, Belgian voters elected their national parliament, 21 members of the European Parliament, and regional parliaments."},{"title":"Interim Constitution (South Africa)","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_Constitution_(South_Africa)","description":"Fundamental law of South Africa from 1994 to 1997","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa_%281932%E2%80%932000%29.svg/320px-Coat_of_arms_of_South_Africa_%281932%E2%80%932000%29.svg.png","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":363},"abstract":"The Interim Constitution was the fundamental law of South Africa from during the first non-racial general election on 27 April 1994 until it was superseded by the final constitution on 4 February 1997. As a transitional constitution it required the newly elected Parliament to also serve as a constituent assembly to adopt a final constitution. It made provision for a major restructuring of government as a consequence of the abolition of apartheid. It also introduced an entrenched bill of rights against which legislation and government action could be tested, and created the Constitutional Court with broad powers of judicial
