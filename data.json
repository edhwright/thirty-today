Among the array of graver and more material contests now facing civilization, struggles from Sarajevo to New Hampshire, the one decided yesterday in Philadelphia stands out in its symbolic weight. In the chess match between Garry Kasparov, the world's best living player, and I.B.M.'s Deep Blue, an otherwise undistinguished supercomputer, humanity's collective self-esteem was once more on the line. \n\n     The latest blow to our chauvinism began in the first round of the six-game match when Deep Blue bested our best after only 36 moves. Although Mr. Kasparov  rallied to avoid humiliation in the series, the early result shocked not only the chess world; it shattered the pride of those of us who would never dream of  pitting our own worth against a $15 home computer program. Suddenly, we once again needed to explain ourselves to ourselves.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"In the Region/Westchester;A Preview of Coming Attractions for White Plains","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-a-preview-of-coming-attractions-for-white-plains.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"No Offense","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/books/no-offense.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"Clinton Backing Vast Effort To Restore Florida Swamps","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/us/clinton-backing-vast-effort-to-restore-florida-swamps.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960218","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/travel/c-corrections-051594.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"A Jetway, Please","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/travel/l-a-jetway-please-051667.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"Spacecraft Is Off on 3-Year Voyage to Asteroid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/us/spacecraft-is-off-on-3-year-voyage-to-asteroid.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960218","headline":"Bruno F.

With one grandfather the Episcopal Bishop of New York and the other the founder of an eminent Wall Street law firm, Oscar receives an education that is less sentimental than perfectly decorous, its lessons encouraging Social Register virtues: tact, compromise, genteel humility, excellent manners. After Yale and Columbia Law School, he abandons his dreams of a literary career to join the family legal practice, following his father's advice that it provides the best arena for his \"constant preoccupation,\" people  watching. (\"He said it didn't matter in which I took the greater interest: the clients or the law.\") And there are plenty of opportunities for social observation: a Supreme Court Justice whose opinions on torts and contracts \"read like short stories by Henry James\"; a gossipy Hungarian princess who hobnobbed with Proust; a talented bounder who wins a partnership in the Fairfax law firm,  marriage to Oscar's sister and national prominence in World War II. There is even a cameo appearance by Edith Wharton, Mr. Auchincloss's literary progenitor, showing off the roses in her garden in France. More a series of vignettes than a novel, the book has a few weak spots: the dialogue can be too starched and frilly, and a Spanish daughter-in-law seems to exist only so that Oscar can deliver opinions on Franco. Yet Mr. Auchincloss's own voice remains a seductive  one -- crisp, stately and wonderfully controlled.

A few days at the beginning or the end and that's that. This was my third tour over a period of 20 years, and it was still Jerusalem the Golden that got most of the attention and  almost all the respect. In Jerusalem malls at night, even carousing kids wear yarmulkes, and people on the street stare at you if you're a grown woman walking around in pants. Compared with all this piety, the mood in Tel Aviv is stunningly secular. In this city, which variously calls itself the Big Orange, the City That Never Stops, and the City That Never Takes a Break (who writes their p.r., I wonder?), it's hard to imagine anyone looking at you askance about anything. This is the contemporary version of the vision that Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, had of a cosmopolitan city on the sea: Tel Aviv -- literally a hill (man-made) of spring (new life). Where once there was absolutely nothing, there is now an urban sprawl of about 350,000 people -- nearly two million if you count suburbs -- and a lot of awful architecture that springs up from a flat terrain with nowhere to hide. I suppose that depending on whether you come here  first or last on a trip to Israel, you say, \"Look what they've accomplished,\" or \"My God,what have they done?\" \n\n      Still, once you've said one or the other, and if you let it, Tel Aviv is a place that grows on you -- because it really is teeming with life, at all hours  and especially at night, a combination Oriental bazaar and Miami Beach, with the Mediterranean grace notes of Nice thrown in. Since its long Mediterranean coast  is a major asset, Tel Aviv could be taken simply as a beach resort and left at that. The rest of Israel boasts of making the land green. Tel Aviv seems to have done the opposite. Hotel follows hotel along the shore, blocking views of the water with entrances on Hayarkon Street, one of the main arteries of the city. Where you stay probably determines what you feel about the beach. The view from my balcony in the Moriah Plaza, a big and busy hotel, strongly suggested Miami. A terrace at the super luxe Dan Tel Aviv, only a few blocks to the south, seemed to look out on a resplendent Cote d'Azur.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"WEDDINGS;Laura J.

Most of the streets are of a powdery red sand and without sidewalks so that there is a casual commingling of vehicles and pedestrians. Here and there you can see small patches of macadam -- many of  these streets were paved back when the city had more money.

My husband, our 6-year-old son and I had awoken to a rooster crowing outside our hotel on the outskirts of San Jose, Costa Rica's capital, ready to leave room service for the rain forest. Visions of butterflies and jaguars beckoned, as we were whisked through the still deserted streets for our charter plane to Corcovado National Park, one of the largest, least accessible, and most biologically significant of any tropical forest park in Costa Rica and one of the last refuges in the world for such threatened species as the jaguar, the ocelot and the tapir. \n\n     An overland trip by bus, car or jeep from San Jose to Corcovado can take as long as nine hours over rough terrain, yet the park, created in 1975 to ward off the threat of increased logging and gold mining to its exotic plants and animals, still attracts a spirited caravan of backpackers and eco-tourists. The  80-minute plane ride we chose instead, part of a four-day expedition package provided by Costa Rica Expeditions, gave us spectacular views of the coast and the lowland rain forest of Corcovado, situated on the Osa Peninsula, which protrudes into the Pacific just north of Panama.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"For Arts Audiences, the Question Is Relevance;Fighters vs. Flutes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/opinion/l-for-arts-audiences-the-question-is-relevance-fighters-vs-flutes-054461.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/books/books-in-brief-fiction-poetry-051802.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960218","headline":"Burning Happiness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/books/burning-happiness-077755.html","abstract":"THE DIARIES OF SYLVIA TOWNSEND WARNER Edited by Claire Harman. 384 pp. North Pomfret, Vt.: Virago/Trafalgar Square.
