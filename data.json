It is hard to explain how a land whose lush pastures nourish dairy and beef herds, whose kitchen gardens and orchards yield sweet strawberries and herbs, whose moors pullulate with lambs and game, and whose cold, clean waters brim with seafood gained a reputation for overboiled cabbage, overdone meat, potatoes with everything.   But a new generation of chefs is restoring the nation's culinary honor. Whereas only a few years ago the better cooks confined themselves almost exclusively to country-house hotels, today Dublin's increasing prominence as a financial center enables it to support some remarkably distinguished restaurants. If their menus have Continental embellishments, each of these three has a character as particular to Dublin as a pint of hand-drawn Guinness. The Commons Restaurant    The most conspicuous newcomer to the Dublin restaurant scene, the three-and-a-half-year-old Commons Restaurant, occupies the basement of two elegant 18th-century houses on the south side of St. Stephen's Green.   Collectively, the buildings are known as Newman House, for it was under their sumptuous plasterwork that the writer and theologian John Henry Newman gave substance to his \"Idea of a University,\" serving as the first rector of the Catholic University of Ireland, the institution that grew into University College Dublin. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote and taught there in the 1880's, and James Joyce, a student of philosophy and English there at the turn of the century, set part of \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in its rooms.   No wonder Michael Fitzgerald pressed for the opportunity to open a restaurant in what until the late 1950's had served as the student canteen. He spent 15 months supervising the remodeling of the basement and the garden behind. The result is a discreet, consistent and stylish haven, more home to corporate pinstripes than student jeans.    The restaurant seats only 40 at generously spaced round tables, each covered with not one but two beige tablecloths. A spectacular flower arrangement occupies a central slate table framed by a pair of columns, but attention shifts to the collection of paintings on Joycean themes specially commissioned from local artists by Mr. Fitzgerald, who revels in pointing out Louis Le Brocquy's striking \"Image of James Joyce.\"    The food is as imposing as the setting, with fixed-price menus changing daily. The head chef, Michael Bolster, a native of County Cork who trained in Britain, delights in juxtaposing Irish products with French delicacies, pairing, say, lobster mousse with braised Puy lentils and black pudding with foie gras.    We opted for savory duck confit, its unctuousness cut with muscat grapes and beets, and a warm parsnip and caramel timbale, which all by itself redeems the reputation of that maligned vegetable.    Mr. Bolster's seafood, much of it purchased direct from small cooperatives on the south coast, is prepared with split-second precision, witness the firm-fleshed John Dory on which I lunched recently. Its chive-strewn white-butter sauce was at once light and sassy, providing an urbane foil to the accompanying colcannon, a classic Irish melange of cabbage and potato, here whipped to a fluff. Lamb with sun-dried tomatoes arrived pink as requested; it was so good that my guest yearned for a more generous helping. The side vegetables played textural counterpoint, crisp broccoli contrasting with well seasoned carrot puree, new potatoes alongside saffron-tinctured duchesse potatoes.   Desserts are modern readings of classics, artfully presented. Who can resist a sinful chocolate roulade filled with white chocolate mousse or fragrant warm apple strudel accompanied by cinnamon cream? At dinner a cheese board laden with half a dozen of Ireland's finest poses a dilemma. How does one choose between mild Cashel Blue, Camembert-like St. Killian, or washed-rind Milleens -- all in tip-top condition? Slivers of each are essential to any cheese-lover's education, or so we discovered.   Wines, too, are up to the mark, with a long, well balanced list. Having decided to drink wine in a country where the (very high) taxes on alcohol are based on volume rather than value, one might as well drink better vintages. At The Commons a pleasant 1993 Sancerre runs $32, whereas twice that buys an outstanding 1991 Condrieu.    The Commons has lived up to University College Dublin's motto, \"ad astra,\" \"to the stars,\" at least partially by winning a first Michelin star last spring. The chef who garnered that honor has moved on, but Michael Bolster and his polished team of 9 chefs and a dozen waiters seem well equipped to maintain the standard. Roly's Bistro    Nearly two years ago, at the height of the recession in Ireland, a group of catering professionals opened a 150-seat \"bistro\" deep in Dublin 4, the home of Ireland's chattering classes. Against all the odds, Roly's Bistro, named for the restaurant's red-bearded greeter and mastermind, has been a near sellout ever since. Its recipe: a top-flight chef using the best materials, reasonable prices based on high turnover and an attractive, buzzy ambiance.   Colin O'Daly heads a staff of 24 chefs. This most resolutely Irish of chefs, locally trained, offers modern renditions of a broad variety of native dishes, changing his menus at least twice a month. Thus his fillet of beef may be accompanied by boxty; this medley of mashed and grated potatoes enriched with melted butter, originating in County Cavan, has supplanted gratin dauphinoise in my potato pantheon. Most of us recoil from the notion of blood sausage, but Mr. O'Daly's Clonakilty black pudding, sauced with sage-infused tomatoes, converts even the most squeamish to this country staple.   Mr. O'Daly also toys with exotic accents. His Dublin Bay prawns, perhaps more familiar to us as langoustines, come with beautiful saffron tagliatelle, and snappy cucumbers and fennel, and his lamb from the Wicklow Mountains just south of Dublin has the added tang of apricots and ginger.   We admired Mr. O'Daly's approach as we settled down to delicate warm scallop mousse sharpened with lemon balm and Colin's prawn bisque, a full-flavored yet light shellfish essence. Monkfish, sauced with nettles and hazelnuts, and a scallop of wild salmon, set off by the acid of both sorrel and spinach, were firm-flaked, their tastes fresh and defined.    On advice, we opted for creme brulee. Lest regulars tire of its silken shimmer, Colin O'Daly regularly alternates its flavoring. On this evening he had added a hint of maple syrup and a dollop of crunchy walnut ice cream on the side. Desserts here tend toward schoolboy favorites such as queen of puddings -- bread pudding layered with red-fruit jam and crowned with meringue.    The relatively short wine list, revised monthly, runs mostly to European wines. The Chablis Premier Cru '90 from A. Regnard ($31.75) is an exceptional value.   Such good food naturally breeds good cheer, which is compounded by the surroundings: daffodil-colored walls, comfortable seating and eager clients. In spite of the high turnover, customers rarely feel pressured, thanks to a well-staggered reservation system and an alert young dining-room team.  Locks    For atmosphere and choice food, Locks is hard to beat. Situated along the reedy Grand Canal, which marks the southern boundary of the Georgian part of the city, Locks exudes Irish charm with a rustic inflection that has endeared the place to Dubliners for the past 14 years. Theater people, in particular, seem to congregate here.   After ringing the doorbell, diners are shown in, as often as not by the Danish-born owner, Claire Douglas, who graciously seats them beside the bar. Over drinks they can peruse a menu and take in the neighboring 50-seat dining room. An eclectic feast of 19th- and 20th-century engravings and lithographs lines the cream walls, and hoop-backed Victorian chairs face old-rose-colored banquettes across white-napped tables arrayed on worn Oriental rugs.   The menu is at one with the decor: reassuring and homey, even if few homes can boast a chef as skilled as French-trained Brian Buckley. Succulent black pudding with onion sauce enriched with duck fat and lamb kidneys with mustard are almost always listed as starters, but Mr. Buckley's inventive grace notes include monkfish and prawns sparked with Thai curry sauce and pineapple or salmon with vermouth garnished with herby marinated tomatoes. Servings arrive on handsome old china, each elaborate pattern seemingly chosen to set off the preparation.   With supreme (if fleeting) disregard for American Heart Association guidelines, I tucked into a vast portion of salmon in pastry with rich caraway hollandaise and too soon found myself mopping the plate with the house soda bread.    Game is a delight at this time of year. Venison in a titillating raspberry vinegar and Dubonnet essence is generally offered, but Locks is a fine place to try less familiar widgeon (a small wild duck) or rare roasted tender young snipe or woodcock when they are available. My husband, Arthur, chose the rich game pie, an amalgam of hare, pigeon and pheasant, and found it wonderful.    \"Rich\" is an adjective that recurs when describing food at Locks. No stinting on butter and cream here.  Such sophisticated comfort food suits Dublin's damp northern climate. Visitors who are less self-indulgent will find alternatives, for example, smoked salmon and grilled black sole. Don't be put off by the term \"black sole\"; it's known as Dover sole on the other side of the Irish Sea. At Locks it is cooked to flaky perfection.   For dessert I chose the comparative austerity of fruit salad with flavorful blackberry sorbet but couldn't resist a spoonful of my husband's gooseberry fool, a lush blend of tart fruit and sweet cream.

Jascha Horenstein is another case entirely, a conductor of marginal renown who has generated tremendous cult interest in the 21 years since his death. He lacked the long-term association with a big-name orchestra and record label that has elevated lesser musicians. But in the last few years his studio and live performances, with orchestras superior and inferior, in sound good and terrible, have proliferated on CD in astonishing numbers. We finally have an adequate record of one of the most vital, idiosyncratic interpreters of the 20th century.   Among other things, Horenstein was the greatest Mahler conductor of his generation, perhaps of any generation. His authority in Mahler was challenged only by Leonard Bernstein, and in some ways Horenstein brought his listeners closer to the heart of Mahler's music, rather than the heart of one conductor's experience of it. Performances of Mahler, and of Bruckner, have grown increasingly monumental and monotone in recent years; it is deeply satisfying to go back to Horenstein's flexible, full-voiced, superbly balanced readings, in which the texture is richly varied yet all of a piece. A missionary for these composers decades before they came into fashion, Horenstein never lost his youthful ardor and awe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"When Fate Is Calling The Tune","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/movies/film-view-when-fate-is-calling-the-tune.html","abstract":"  FATE PLAYED A STARRING ROLE AT THIS year's New York Film Festival, figuring prominently in a surprisingly large number of films on the schedule.

It is coming to an end in quiet maturity. Indeed, in a recent series of Beethoven piano sonatas played on early instruments at Merkin Concert Hall, the greatest revelation was that there was none. At least in the eight sonatas I heard, Malcolm Bilson's stated ambition \"to open new paths of thought\" was only modestly fulfilled. Mr. Bilson, the godfather of the eight-concert, seven-pianist, four-piano series was, as usual, a consummate musician, playing with intelligence and verve, and some of the other pianists were insightful as well, but was anything established that we did not already know? Over the years, modern pianos have proved how inadequate their historical rivals are, and historical instruments have returned the insult. They are both correct.   We know, for example, that some of Beethoven's pedal markings can be executed only approximately on contemporary instruments and that his sharply etched dynamic changes can sound artificial on the modern Steinway. On the other hand, Russell Sherman's penetrating Beethoven performances heard recently at the Miller Theater on the campus of Columbia University and Richard Goode's ever-deepening Beethoven interpretations, to be presented in part later this month at Avery Fisher Hall, would be inconceivable on the lovely five-octave replica of a 1790 Anton Walter fortepiano used at Merkin Hall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"For Aristide's Followers, Every Step Is a Dance, Every Cheer a Song","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/world/mission-haiti-scene-for-aristide-s-followers-every-step-dance-every-cheer-song.html","abstract":"  At the moment of the Rev.

Considering the sizable role he played in creating both that shouting style of blues singing and the raucous, dance-oriented rhythm-and-blues that succeeded it in the 1940's, it's probably not surprising that Turner was one of rock's chief architects.

Augusto Pinochet of Chile to cling to power might give a false impression of his popularity.   I was on vacation in Chile for what happened to be the 21st anniversary of the general's infamous coup against the democratically elected Government of Salvador Allende in 1973. While it's true several thousand people (mostly military families) showed up at the military academy to celebrate the coup's anniversary, the sentiment of the rest of the populace was anything but hero worship.   The country was riveted that week by daily student demonstrations all over the country against General Pinochet. And on Sept. 11, the day of the anniversary, I witnessed a turnout of Chileans estimated at 20,000 (10 times as many as showed up at the military academy) march to the grave of Allende and to a monument for the thousands of victims of torture and murder under General Pinochet's 18-year rule as president.   The first few pages of Chile's major newspapers were given to covering the march to the cemetery, while the military academy gathering was buried in the back pages.   I spoke to dozens of ordinary Chileans, and it was hard to find anyone with anything positive to say about General Pinochet. The general's ability to remain as army commander seems not a result of popularity but perhaps attributable to the military's loyalty and to his ability to crush a government whose policies he disagrees with.   In this age in which human rights criminals are becoming less tolerated throughout the world, the presence of one of the 20th century's worst human rights abusers in a position of power appears to be a source of frustration to the majority of Chileans.

After all, young men and women now live together (in coed college dormitories), shop side by side (at stores like the Gap, Banana Republic and Urban Outfitters) and wear the same styles (multiple earrings, jeans and clunky boots), so an androgynous fragrance seems a logical component of a unisex wardrobe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"The View From: Mamaroneck;\nWhen the World Gets Tougher and the Streets Get Meaner","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/nyregion/the-view-from-mamaroneck-when-the-world-gets-tougher-and-the.html","abstract":"CARMEN VIGLIOTTI has a tiger tattooed on the inside of one forearm, a dragon on the other.

That attitude may reflect the fact that over the centuries Brittany's ties with its neighbors across the Channel to the north were often as close as its ties with France to the east. In the early Christian era, the founding saints of many Breton towns came originally from Cornwall and Wales. During the French Revolution, French royalists exiled themselves in England, planning their return to Quiberon, where they hoped to join forces with Breton royalists and crush the revolt.. In our own time, thousands of British and French troops were evacuated from the Channel ports of Brittany just before the fall of France, and four years later, in August 1944, the Americans recaptured the Breton port of St.-Malo, extending the beachhead established against the Germans by the Allied landings in Normandy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941016","headline":"Big Apple Greeter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/travel/l-big-apple-greeter-500119.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: All of us at Big Apple Greeter read the Practical Traveler column \"Fewer Tours for the Disabled\" (July 31) with great interest, particularly since it says that travelers with disabilities are interested in mainstreaming and fewer are traveling in groups.

Learning how to use them is turning out to be one of the big stories of the 1990's. In the past few years, a new generation of architecture and design curators have joined the staffs of American museums. They are only beginning to figure out how these institutions can best serve architecture. It is not going to be an easy process, to judge from \"House Rules,\" a show of residential architecture at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. This is a flawed exhibition. But it is also just the kind of experimental venture that museums with a serious commitment to architecture must support.   Up to now, the Wexner Center has presented only traveling architecture shows initiated by other museums. With \"House Rules,\" it initiates its own architectural program, and perhaps it is not surprising that the show has much in common with the architecturally ambitious building in which it is presented. Designed by Peter Eisenman, the Wexner theoretically provides a cultural bridge between the ivory tower and the city beyond.

Els won the United States Open this summer and his victory yesterday earned the South African the biggest golf paycheck in European golf history -- $240,000. Montgomerie, a Scot, failed to hole three short putts for pars on the outward nine and failed to make any putt from more than 10 feet in the 34-hole match. (AP) First Victory: Bob Estes, buoyed by a four-stroke lead entering the final round, shot a one-under-par 70 yesterday to win the Texas Open in San Antonio for the first title of his seven-year PGA Tour career. Estes won by a stroke, covering the tight, tree-lined Oak Hills Country Club course in 19-under 265. Gil Morgan and Don Pooley each closed to a stroke, but neither could catch Estes. Morgan finished second at 266 after a bogey-free round of 67. Pooley (68) was another shot back at 267. (AP) TENNIS  Ivanisevic Defeats Chang at Super Seiko  Top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic had forehand and backhand winners to add to his usual supply of aces and volleys for a 6-4, 6-4 victory over sixth-seeded Michael Chang yesterday in the Super Seiko final in Tokyo. Chang was playing in his first tournament since the United States Open. (AP) ASIAN GAMES  China Takes 41 Percent of Gold Medals  China won four track events on the final day of the Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, yesterday and wound up with 137 -- or 41 percent -- of the 337 gold medals at stake in the competition. Uzbekistan, a games newcomer, defeated China in the gold-medal soccer game, 4-2, in the final event of the Asiad. China finished as the leader in golds and overall medals for the third straight time. South Korea finished with 63 golds, and Japan was third with 59. (AP) YACHT RACING  Autissier Slows Down, but Still Holds Lead  After five days riding the coattails of a windy low-pressure system in the South Atlantic Ocean, the solo sailor Isabelle Autissier entered an area of calms yesterday that slowed her pace. Still ahead by nearly 800 miles over her next closest rival, Autissier leads 19 lone skippers in the B.O.C. single-handed around-the-world yacht race. David Scully, of Chicago, a competitor whose tactical errors have left him seventh in the fleet, rallied yesterday by covering 194 miles, the longest distance of the day.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941017","headline":"Union Files a Complaint For Joffrey Dancers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/17/arts/union-files-a-complaint-for-joffrey-dancers.html","abstract":"  The American Guild of Musical Artists has filed a demand with the American Arbitration Association on behalf of the dancers of the Joffrey Ballet. The union, which announced the action late Friday, has charged the ballet company with non-payment of two weeks of work in the spring season this year and in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons, as well as medical reimbursements for the 1993-94 season, severance pay, pension contributions and salary and overtime adjustments in the last three years. The company is also charged with failure to pass along to the union the dues deducted from the dancers' paychecks.    \"We felt for a very long time there has been a big coverup about the financial troubles of the company,\" a spokesman for the dancers, who are on tour in Hawaii, said yesterday. \"The Joffrey's biggest fear has been that no one would give money to a financially troubled company. But it seems nobody's giving money anyway to a company that is supposedly in good health because of 'Billboards.'

The discovery, made in Niger by an expedition led by Dr. Paul C. Sereno, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago, also begins to fill in a blank page in the dinosaur fossil record. The newly discovered species are among the first found in Africa from the Cretaceous geologic period, 145 million to 65 million years ago, which includes the heyday of dinosaurs down to their extinction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941018","headline":"Cuomo, for One, Seeks to Hitch His Star To Clinton's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/nyregion/1994-campaign-governor-cuomo-for-one-seeks-hitch-his-star-clinton-s.html","abstract":"  In a year in which Democratic politicians are fleeing from the outstretched arms of President Clinton, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, ever the loyalist Democrat, made it clear today that he longs for the Administration's embrace and does not mind returning it. Indeed, he made a repeated point of describing the President as great but misunderstood, a heroic figure whose struggle for popularity sounded very much like his own.   \"He has the most extraordinary record for achieving things that has not been appreciated,\" the Governor said of President Clinton while campaigning on Long Island today, calling Mr. Clinton not just a good President but a great President. \"I think I know why: when you get something done, you don't let it sink in and exploit it. Let the people know what you've done.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941018","headline":"BOC Boat in Jeopardy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/sports/boc-boat-in-jeopardy.html","abstract":"  Josh Hall, a 32-year-old British sailor competing in the BOC yacht race round the world, called by radio for help yesterday afternoon after hitting an unknown object at sea. Hall, who was in ninth place among the 19 solo sailors, said that his boat was taking on water quickly and that he was in danger of sinking.   \"He said that his boat was severely holed,\" said Herb McCormick, a BOC race spokesman in a telephone interview from Cape Town, South Africa, the port where Hall and the other BOC racers are headed. \"He has a pump on board, but said he was barely able to stay ahead of the water coming in.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941018","headline":"Correction Officer Charged in Killing of a Queens Man","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/nyregion/correction-officer-charged-in-killing-of-a-queens-man.html","abstract":"  A state correction officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter early today after he fatally shot a 27-year-old Queens man yesterday as the two men struggled on the sidewalk in front of a public housing project, police officials said.

A protean, productive figure, Mingus wrote pieces that required his musicians to play at the outer limits of their abilities. The material ranged from the silken and thoughtful \"Reincarnation of a Love Bird\" to the intentionally archaic \"My Jelly Roll Soul,\" and it required not only improvisational power and originality, but interpretations according to Mingus's deep blues sensibility as well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941018","headline":"After 40 Days and 40 Nights, Players and Owners Will Meet in Capital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/sports/baseball-after-40-days-and-40-nights-players-and-owners-will-meet-in-capital.html","abstract":"  Five years to the day after the World Series earthquake, there were slight rumblings yesterday in the long dormant negotiations in baseball's labor dispute.
