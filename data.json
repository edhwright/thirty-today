Partly because the  festival has always offered these kinds of pairings, and partly because the programming often did not match the announced concept, this effort came in for some derision.

The final installments are tonight and tomorrow evening.         You may be wondering, what kind of theme is 1784? Good question. It was hardly a watershed, politically or musically. Mozart, then 28, was fairly prolific; when wasn't he?

The other miracle is that the two stars of \"It Could Happen to You\" keep it sailing over a script that is often as predictable and flat as the movie's new title.

There's something pleasant and marginally uplifting  about seeing 24 contemporary artists and designers take their best shots, in a relaxed summery sort of way, on a strip of real estate as rife with raunchy vitality and decay as 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. Intended for pedestrian consumption, the show is a mildly entertaining walk-through, with very little that holds the attention for very long and almost no artist shown to real advantage. Ultimately, the street's powerful cacophony wins out, sweeping all before it like the trashy force of manmade nature that it is.         This year's version includes a couple of holdovers from last year's, neither  distinguished, which seem to have become a permanent part of the Times Square landscape. One is the blocklong sign adorned with brightly colored chairs that shouts \"Everybody\" in black capital letters on a taxicab-yellow billboard between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and seems as much an advertisement for some mysterious product as an exhortation to community. The other is Dick Elliott's \"Noise Reducing Apparatus, No. 1,\" a wall of 18,000 safety reflectors in red, yellow, blue and green that has all the simplicity, but little of the charm, of  folk art.

Although the board praised the Mayor's efforts to reverse the trend of growing budgets for the first time in 16 years, it concluded that New York faced budget gaps of $2 billion to $3 billion in the coming years because spending continued to grow faster than revenues.

The stock and bond markets rallied strongly on the announcement as investors  decided that well-stocked retailers would stop ordering new goods and, as a result, the pace of economic growth might slow in the months ahead. Slower growth would help keep inflation, which is now just below 3 percent, in check and could reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

Vintage International, $11. These stories take place in India, where a retired civil servant recounts the adventures of holy men and courtesans, loveless children and love-struck adults. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hower, said the tales are \"told with skill and sensitivity\" and \"a delight to read.\" DENYING THE HOLOCAUST: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory By Deborah E. Lipstadt. Plume, $10.95. The author examines the arguments of those who insist that the Nazi campaign of  genocide against the Jews never happened, tracing them from the pro-German statements of former isolationists after World War II to \"scholarly\" attempts to debunk the Holocaust in the United States today. It is an \"important and impassioned work,\" Walter Reich said here last year, written \"particularly from  an American perspective.\" Exploring the same problem with a concentration on France is ASSASSINS OF MEMORY: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust, by Pierre  Vidal-Naquet, translated by Jeffrey Mehlman (Columbia University, $15.95). In the same review, Mr. Reich said that this French historian impresses the reader  with his \"intellectual and moral power.\" The historical roots of enmity toward Jews are analyzed in ANTISEMITISM: The Longest Hatred, by Robert S. Wistrich (Schocken, $15), which shows how early Christian prejudice, based on theology, has evolved into a more geopolitical animosity today. It is \"as good a one-volume overview of anti-Semitism as exists in English,\" Mark Silk said here  in 1992. Efforts to remind the world of the victims of Nazi anti-Semitism are the subject of THE TEXTURE OF MEMORY: Holocaust Memorials and Meaning, by James  E. Young (Yale University, $20).

His excellent essay is one of 14 commentaries by artists, critics and collectors that complement the 82-year-old French-born artist's work in LOUISE BOURGEOIS: The Locus of Memory.  Works 1982-1993 (Brooklyn Museum/Abrams, $45). The subtly lighted photographs perfectly render Ms. Bourgeois's luscious yet disquieting forms -- for example,  an array of lotion-pink rubber breasts in \"Mamelles\" (1991) or the odd anemone-like colonies sprouting from sparkling marble in \"Untitled (With Growth)\" (1989). The artist's extraordinary new installations, the \"Cell\" series, are beautifully documented: cubicles of industrial metal fence, rusted and peeling, enclose uncanny assemblages of found objects and finished sculpture, as in \"Cell (Choisy)\" (1990-93), in which a small white marble version of Ms. Bourgeois's family house sits beneath a scale model of a guillotine. The intensely personal nature of Ms. Bourgeois's work, fueled by the artist's deep exploration of her emotions, memories and body, has attracted the  admiration of a wide spectrum of artists and critics; the Minimalist artist Richard Serra and the Conceptualist artists Jenny Holzer and Adrian Piper contribute short statements to the book. Her work is an attempt, as she puts it, \"to give meaning and shape to frustration and suffering.\" It is this quest that  goes beyond the immediate sensory appeal of her sculptures and captivates our sometimes unwilling emotional attention.

Along the way he \"slept rough\" in a bedroll under the stars, kept watch for the infamous \"Beast of Gevaudan,\" a vicious, flesh-eating wolf-man first sighted in the area in 1764, ruminated on subjects like love, history and religious tolerance, and took notes for a book published the following spring called \"Travels With a Donkey in the Cevennes.\" \n\n     Ever since I first read that splendid little volume, I have wanted to hike in the Cevennes. I knew that Stevenson's 12-day adventure cost him 85 francs. How much more expensive might a trip there be a hundred years later, I wondered. After all, the Cevennes remains one of the poorest regions in France -- Gaul's Appalachia, inhabited by people who squeeze a living from hardscrabble farms, raising sheep and cows, keeping bees and harvesting chestnuts, as well as by a fair number of British expatriates lured there by low real-estate prices. The native Cevenols are rugged, insular people, many of whose Protestant forebears fought the army of the Catholic French crown during the 18th century War of the  Camisards. Today, as then, there are few towns of any size in the Cevennes; gas  stations and grocery stores are rarities, movie theaters nonexistent -- though first-run films are sometimes shown in village halls, a little like traveling circuses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940731","headline":"TRAVEL ADVISORY;Construction Delays Bradley Airport Traffic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/travel/travel-advisory-construction-delays-bradley-airport-traffic.html","abstract":"Travelers arriving at or departing from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., should allow additional time getting to and from the airport this summer.

They come for the quality ingredients, inventive cooking and seasoning that often presents a challenge to the taste buds. And for us, therein lies a bit of  a problem. It is easy to succumb to these tempting dishes full of unusual and winning combinations, which are described in detail on the small menu. One wants them all, and some are truly superb. But be warned that Peter Johnson, the chef  and owner, uses hot chilies unstintingly, and although we recognize that they are essential to the \"warm climate cuisines\" he espouses and that peppery heat provides dishes with an additional dimension, one we usually enjoy, we're less impressed when that fire masks the flavors that led us to ordering the complex dishes in the first place. \n\n     In any case, this kitchen's style is splendidly idiosyncratic, with Pacific Rim inspirations Mr. Johnson brought home with him from his years on Maui. Expect yin and yang arrangements in presentation and in taste, juxtapositions, for example, of pale and dark, spicy and neutral, hot and cool, sweet and sour.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940731","headline":"Love, War and Leotards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/books/love-war-and-leotards.html","abstract":"MATERIALISM Poems.

For the new Davis Museum and Cultural Center on the Wellesley College campus, the first building outside Spain designed by Mr. Moneo, one of the world's most respected architects, is right next door to the Jewett Arts Center, the first major building erected anywhere by the eminent American, Mr. Rudolph. The Jewett, now 36 years old, is a building of no small importance to American architecture. And it is not easy to build in the shadow of.         I have always thought of the Jewett as the design in which Paul Rudolph managed to achieve what Eero Saarinen spent most of his career trying to do, which is to create a version of modernism that would be rich, textured, almost picturesque, and comfortable in its relationship to older buildings around it. Mr. Rudolph's art center sits beside the historic Gothic structures of Wellesley with comfort and ease: this building of red brick and stone trim with concrete grilles is secure enough to eschew the extremes of either imitation or defiance.
