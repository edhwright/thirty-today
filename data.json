The curtain raiser was \"Snake Alley\" (1989), by David Dzubay, a composer in his late 20's. Like many young composers, Mr. Dzubay writes in an eclectic style, which is essentially tonal, but which raids atonal techniques when they suit the work's thrust.

There's always the same sort of publicity flurry, based on the musician's abilities in the jazz and Afro-Cuban idioms and the political and personal bravery it often took to escape. Usually their careers dwindle after a few years as the escape story loses its potency and as the musical limitations become clear.   The latest arrival is Gonzalo Rubalcaba, a 30-year-old Cuban pianist who has moved to the Dominican Republic with the blessings of the Cuban Government. Mr. Rubalcaba has been playing jazz festivals abroad for the last seven years and has had a remarkably fertile recording career, making Latin jazz, jazz and fusion albums for a variety of labels. It's easy to see why a record company might smell money around Mr. Rubalcaba. Not only is Afro-Cuban music blooming in popularity, but Mr. Rubalcaba is a classically trained virtuoso pianist. And even if he does have the blessing of the Cuban Government, he's still performing under a severe limitation: because of stipulations imposed by the United States Government he can't accept a penny of his earnings. Art appearing under adversity is always a draw, even in a post cold-war world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930519","headline":"Former Police Officer Stabbed While Intervening in an Attack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/19/nyregion/former-police-officer-stabbed-while-intervening-in-an-attack.html","abstract":"  The nervous commuters watched from a distance on the Bronx subway platform.

This elephant has been cast out of the herd. Perhaps it is mad; perhaps it harbors some wound that does not allow it to graze in peace with its brothers and sisters. So it leaves the herd, or is forced out. And alone in the jungles it eats the dry leaves of loneliness.

Learning his contract might not be renewed, he floated the rumor that he was or might be a Communist. His colleagues, who would be happy to see him go, rallied around him on grounds of academic freedom. He kept his job. The case of Prof. Leonard Jeffries of the City College of New York bears some resemblance to this fiction. \n\nThere are excellent reasons why he should not be chairman of the black studies department -- reasons long available to the college's administrators. Although he served as chairman for 20 years, a review of the standard indexes of academic publications reveals absolutely nothing under his name. Besides, so lengthy a term is peculiar. Most academics don't want to spend their time doing a chairman's administrative chores; there's no extra pay and little or no reduction in other academic responsibilities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"Critic's Notebook; 'Cheers' Is Dead, but There's Always the Wake . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/arts/critic-s-notebook-cheers-is-dead-but-there-s-always-the-wake.html","abstract":"  And there you have it.

Not by an outfielder's insecurity or a general manager's ineptitude or the media's ravenous appetite, although he took the rap for all that, too. Torborg was fired because the competition in New Jock City has become an interdisciplinary battle royal and Torborg was compared with a man who is perceived to have given the Knicks collective character, to have squeezed a handful of loose change into a golden coin.   So why couldn't Torborg have done the same thing, ask the querulous voices of think-tank radio? Why couldn't Torborg, with basically better material than Riley -- at least on paper -- teach, motivate, boot, abuse, do whatever was necessary to make those overripe adolescents earn their amazing salaries? Those are good questions in New Jock City, now that cross-sports comparisons are mandatory for fandom. With the exception of Patrick Ewing, there are no certified superstars on the Knicks, and even Ewing is not the standard at his position. So if the Knicks beat Chicago, the key will be Coach Riley. Meanwhile, the Mets have Doc Gooden, Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray, Howard Johnson, Tony Fernandez, and if they can't even beat Chicago, the key must be Manager Torborg.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"A Key to Flu Virus Infection Is Identified","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/us/a-key-to-flu-virus-infection-is-identified.html","abstract":"  Researchers say they have identified a spring-like mechanism on the surface of flu viruses that plays an important role in the viruses' infection of human cells.

If the revue is not always as funny as it wants to be, more often than not its humor lands, as in its \"politically correct\" version of Walt Disney's \"Snow White.\" Mr. Busch's flamboyant gowns and wigs are also hilarious in themselves, and he conveys an irresistibly mischievous enthusiasm for the fun of dressing up.

When 16 of his works went on the auction block in New York in a 24-hour period with disastrous results -- only two sold, and they went for very low prices -- it was the talk of the art world.   The poor sales created a domino effect in the entire Warhol market.

Most museums closed at 6 P.M. sharp, with major ones holding evening hours to one day a week (usually Tuesday or Thursday). But in the last few years, the museum world has discovered that later is better -- more convenient to a more diverse audience -- and a quiet revolution in art-viewing hours has begun. Now not an evening passes when you can't look at art in some Manhattan museum, large or small, from 6 to 8 P.M.    These hours between day and night are among the best for esthetic enjoyment. They enable the visitor to avoid the weekend crush so prevalent at major museums, or to fit in visits to less prominent institutions when they find themselves in the neighborhood. Twilight art viewing need compete neither with workday or evening obligations nor with leisurely weekend pursuits, like spending Saturday in the park or Sunday on the couch. And it seems that the very brevity of these dusk hours encourages a special kind of concentration and enjoyment, something like the museological equivalent of wine tasting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"On My Mind; Trickle-Down Mercy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/opinion/on-my-mind-trickle-down-mercy.html","abstract":"  The best way for the U.S. to help the Chinese people win relief from daily oppression is to keep enriching the Chinese economy through trade.

Orpheus's music had, poets tell us, the power to make trees and mountains bow their heads; it could draw iron tears from the Lord of the Underworld. In Philip Glass's new opera, \"Orphee,\" which is receiving its world premiere performances here at the American Repertory Theater until July 10 (and which will also be seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall), Orpheus is turned into a hip French poet. This is fortunate: the music did not have to face the challenge of matching its mythic origins.   The opera is based on Jean Cocteau's 1949 film \"Orphee,\" so it did not have to demonstrate great gifts of poesy either. Cocteau set the film in contemporary France, and he avoided any demonstration of his poet's achievements. The opera libretto, adapted by Mr. Glass and edited by Robert Brustein, the company's artistic director, is just a shortened version of the movie screenplay. The opera reproduces nearly all of Cocteau's surreal alterations to the Greek myth: the motorcyclists who are the agents of Death; the mirrors through which the world of the dead can be entered; the rubber gloves that give passage through these zones; the radio that sputters odd fragments of Morse code and Appolinaire's poetry; the icy Princess who captures the souls of the dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"Judge Dismisses Contempt Case Against Close-Mouthed Lawyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/nyregion/judge-dismisses-contempt-case-against-close-mouthed-lawyer.html","abstract":"  A Manhattan judge has thrown out a highly unusual criminal contempt charge against a lawyer who refused to tell a grand jury who had paid her legal fees.

But last week, in the most definitive study yet, researchers reported that annual testing for hidden blood in the stool could help doctors cut the mortality rate for colorectal cancers by a hefty 33 percent. Applied widely, the test could thus save 20,000 lives from among the 60,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in the U.S. each year.
