There is even subversive social comment in the uneasily casual relationship between the Count and his retainers. Add to that some top-drawer Mozart, with hardly a wasted gesture in either the vocal or the orchestral writing, and you have a work that should be a high point of the opera season.   Those considerable joys are tempered at the Metropolitan Opera, where Figaro and his friends enact their drama in the resolutely ugly sets that Jean-Pierre Ponnelle designed in 1985. When the production returned to the house on Monday evening, an interestingly balanced cast and astute conducting by Julius Rudel afforded ample musical pleasures. But it was difficult to avoid either the distractions of the production or, on a cheerier note, the thought that each season carries its crumbling pillars and archways, its unrealistically placed portals and its drab costumes closer to the trash heap.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/nyregion/metro-digest-984540.html","abstract":"  RENO TO PURSUE CROWN HTS.

It goes without saying that stage pieces like \"Mahagonny\" and \"The Threepenny Opera\" made Weill famous in a way that his earlier pursuit of the classical European tradition never would have.   The Quartet smoothly masters old ideas: stretched tonality, imitations of previous forms, studious use of imitative counterpoint and even some impudent use of different meters and speeds playing against one another.  But imbedded in these textures is the signature that was to be read more clearly in just a few years. Popular dance rhythms and balladlike melodies are among them. Listen carefully and you will also hear Weill's celebration of the march, used here with characteristic bitterness and humor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"A Culture of Clique : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/opinion/IHT-a-culture-of-clique-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"A Destructive Culture of Critique\" (Opinion, Jan. 18) by Deborah Tannen and \"Shouting at One Another in Lieu of Useful Debate\" (Opinion, Jan. 20) by William Pfaff:.Has the press really gotten nastier over the past few yea","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"The Biggest Dragon : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/opinion/IHT-the-biggest-dragon-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Don't Trust the Reports of Superheated Growth\" (Opinion, Jan. 19) by Christopher Lingle and Kurt Wickman:.The authors, senior fellows in European affairs at Singapore University, question the accuracy of World Bank estimates of Chi","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940126","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/us/inside-984370.html","abstract":"  A Growing Power in Russia   Prime Minister Viktor S.

Now, with the Los Angeles Music Center Opera production of \"El Gato Montes\" (\"The Wild Cat\"), which opened here last week, our complacent neglect of the Spanish opera may be in for a revision, too. This zarzuela, written in 1916 by Manuel Penella and, the Los Angeles company says, never before sung in this country in its original language, is dramatic, vigorous and lyrically inventive.   The work has been championed by Placido Domingo, who has been singing in these performances and is artistic consultant to the Los Angeles Opera. The production, which is imported from the Teatro Lirico Nacional la Zarzuela in Madrid, is also part of a conscious effort to attract Hispanic audiences to the opera house. A.T.& T. has given a three-year, $100,000 grant for this purpose, used to support this and future productions. There is even an organization, \"Hispanics for L.A.

Why did the Russian President choose the eve of the Parliament's opening to drag out and dust off 70-year-old slanders and attacks against the Bolshevik Government led by Lenin and Trotsky?   No doubt it's because Mr. Yeltsin feels the threat of growing resistance to privatization and his plans to place Russia's natural resources at the service of Western capitalism. Antiprivatization forces in combination got a significantly higher percentage of votes in the Dec. 12 elections than Mr. Yelstin's fast-track capitalism.

The players, Mark Taylor, Tom Varner, John Clark and Vincent Chancey, have fairly impressive avant-garde credentials, ranging from associations with Sun Ra, Muhal Richard Abrams and Henry Threadgill to John Zorn and LaMonte Young. But they left those credentials at home, for the most part working a soft instrumental area that mixed jazz improvising with pop textures.   Mr. Varner organized the festival, which is named for an early jazz French horn player in New York. Of the four musicians, he turned in the most inspiring set. Backed by Ed Schuller on bass and Steve Johns on drums, Mr. Varner did some improvising, breaking up be-bop phrases with long melody notes. He's at the point where lines, complicated but logical, hurtle to their destiny.
