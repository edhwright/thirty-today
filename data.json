Instead, the city has succeeded in demonstrating that such a system is inherently vulnerable to the stealing of entire elections by insiders at private companies or the Board of Elections itself.\n\nThis morning, the 10-member board is to hold a public hearing at which witnesses will give sworn testimony about the security of the proposed system -- 7,000 all-electronic voting machines, to be built by Sequoia Pacific Voting Equipment Inc. of Jamestown, N.Y., and a central programming system to be developed by Deloitte & Touche, the big national accounting firm. The board has three choices: to go ahead with the purchase, delay it on grounds of security (for a third time) or abandon it. While few officials look forward to yet another election with outmoded equipment, the board would now seem to have no safe choice but to abandon the system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950123","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/23/nyregion/no-headline-446595.html","abstract":"  \"Right now it's a bloody process, and with bloody processes we don't achieve peace.\" -- PRESIDENT EZER WEIZMAN of Israel.

No other wind instrument has attracted such a powerful repertory, or such serious performing talent.   In all three cases, fascination with the clarinet's dark, complex and ambiguous tone was associated with particular people. Mozart wrote for Anton Stadler, Weber for Heinrich Baermann.

This blunt, blaring, truly executed performance scrubbed away such pesky accretions as irony, paradox and double-entendre. The first movement's booming brass enunciations and the Andante Amoroso's quiet grace had value if taken on their own terms, but enthusiasm and good manners take this music only so far and so deep.   The Minnesota is an international orchestra of real accomplishment; it has the flexibility to do what it is asked. So one can only assume that this was the kind of playing Mr. de Waart had in mind. The Seventh, like all the Mahler symphonies, is music written by a conductor for a conductor. Thursday's man in charge demonstrated decisively his can-do attitude.

Scientists have now discovered yet another reason sex can kill, at least in the case of a favorite laboratory creature, the fruit fly. They have determined that a compound in the male's semen is toxic to the female, and that over the long run (which, by fly standards, means a few weeks), the ingredient significantly shortens her life.

One of those trap doors is the deferral of major weapons purchases until 1998, which is designed to make current and near-term spending levels seem more reasonable and to hide the ultimate costs of new weapons already under development or soon to start.

The Council voted to create a strong agency with independent investigative and subpoena powers, as the commission recommended. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vetoed the bill.

But the decline of a park or a playground is far more subtle. It takes a while to notice that the grass is thinning, the soil drying and the trees dying. It may even take a while to notice the crunch of crack vials underfoot, or the fact that half the children's swings are broken. But noticing is a necessity now, because many of New York City's 905 playgrounds and 479 parks, their maintenance staffs pared to the bone, are in sad decay.    Last week, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern offered an idea first touted by the nonprofit Central Park Conservancy. He proposed a modest tax on people living near Central Park. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani promptly shot it down. Though small, the tax was an unfair hit on one group of New Yorkers and a slap in the face to others. It is tempting to set up a park-improvement district in neighorhoods that can afford one.

Webern, far more than Schoenberg or even Berg, was the master colorist of the Second Viennese School. A few string pizzicatos, low sustained tones on the woodwind, high muted cries from the brass, scattered notes on the harp or mandolin: these accumulate into a pointillistic picture of pure, shimmering sound.    Webern died 50 years ago, killed accidentally outside his Austrian home by an American soldier. This year's Focus Festival at Juilliard celebrates both the composer and his musical legacy; the weeklong series began on Friday with a concert by the Juilliard Orchestra at Alice Tully Hall. Thanks to Webern's famous concision, the festival will include nearly all of his works, excepting only a few early songs and brief unpublished orchestral pieces.  There is plenty of room left over for composers who felt his powerful influence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950125","headline":"Cutting Terrorists' Support","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/world/cutting-terrorists-support.html","abstract":"  The United States took steps to prevent the flow of funds from Americans to terrorist groups in Israel and elsewhere.
