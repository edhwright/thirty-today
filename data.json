Lipstadt. Plume, $10.95. The author examines the arguments of those who insist that the Nazi campaign of  genocide against the Jews never happened, tracing them from the pro-German statements of former isolationists after World War II to \"scholarly\" attempts to debunk the Holocaust in the United States today. It is an \"important and impassioned work,\" Walter Reich said here last year, written \"particularly from  an American perspective.\" Exploring the same problem with a concentration on France is ASSASSINS OF MEMORY: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust, by Pierre  Vidal-Naquet, translated by Jeffrey Mehlman (Columbia University, $15.95). In the same review, Mr. Reich said that this French historian impresses the reader  with his \"intellectual and moral power.\" The historical roots of enmity toward Jews are analyzed in ANTISEMITISM: The Longest Hatred, by Robert S. Wistrich (Schocken, $15), which shows how early Christian prejudice, based on theology, has evolved into a more geopolitical animosity today.

His excellent essay is one of 14 commentaries by artists, critics and collectors that complement the 82-year-old French-born artist's work in LOUISE BOURGEOIS: The Locus of Memory.  Works 1982-1993 (Brooklyn Museum/Abrams, $45). The subtly lighted photographs perfectly render Ms. Bourgeois's luscious yet disquieting forms -- for example,  an array of lotion-pink rubber breasts in \"Mamelles\" (1991) or the odd anemone-like colonies sprouting from sparkling marble in \"Untitled (With Growth)\" (1989). The artist's extraordinary new installations, the \"Cell\" series, are beautifully documented: cubicles of industrial metal fence, rusted and peeling, enclose uncanny assemblages of found objects and finished sculpture, as in \"Cell (Choisy)\" (1990-93), in which a small white marble version of Ms. Bourgeois's family house sits beneath a scale model of a guillotine. The intensely personal nature of Ms. Bourgeois's work, fueled by the artist's deep exploration of her emotions, memories and body, has attracted the  admiration of a wide spectrum of artists and critics; the Minimalist artist Richard Serra and the Conceptualist artists Jenny Holzer and Adrian Piper contribute short statements to the book. Her work is an attempt, as she puts it, \"to give meaning and shape to frustration and suffering.\" It is this quest that  goes beyond the immediate sensory appeal of her sculptures and captivates our sometimes unwilling emotional attention.

Along the way he \"slept rough\" in a bedroll under the stars, kept watch for the infamous \"Beast of Gevaudan,\" a vicious, flesh-eating wolf-man first sighted in the area in 1764, ruminated on subjects like love, history and religious tolerance, and took notes for a book published the following spring called \"Travels With a Donkey in the Cevennes.\" \n\n     Ever since I first read that splendid little volume, I have wanted to hike in the Cevennes. I knew that Stevenson's 12-day adventure cost him 85 francs. How much more expensive might a trip there be a hundred years later, I wondered. After all, the Cevennes remains one of the poorest regions in France -- Gaul's Appalachia, inhabited by people who squeeze a living from hardscrabble farms, raising sheep and cows, keeping bees and harvesting chestnuts, as well as by a fair number of British expatriates lured there by low real-estate prices. The native Cevenols are rugged, insular people, many of whose Protestant forebears fought the army of the Catholic French crown during the 18th century War of the  Camisards. Today, as then, there are few towns of any size in the Cevennes; gas  stations and grocery stores are rarities, movie theaters nonexistent -- though first-run films are sometimes shown in village halls, a little like traveling circuses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940731","headline":"TRAVEL ADVISORY;Construction Delays Bradley Airport Traffic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/travel/travel-advisory-construction-delays-bradley-airport-traffic.html","abstract":"Travelers arriving at or departing from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., should allow additional time getting to and from the airport this summer.

These long jackets are cut big, are made of materials with a spongy texture and have sloping shoulders, giving the wearer an elongated line.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940731","headline":"GARDENING;Lo, the Powers of the Mighty Earthworm","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/nyregion/gardening-lo-the-powers-of-the-mighty-earthworm.html","abstract":"CLEOPATRA declared them sacred and wanted to protect them.

But the Administration's own self-portrait was an alarming one. Its main line of defense was to blame the media for all those meetings about what was supposed to be an arm's-length Federal investigation into whether funds from Madison Guaranty were illegally funneled into the Whitewater Development Corporation and Mr. Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign.

The Jewett, now 36 years old, is a building of no small importance to American architecture. And it is not easy to build in the shadow of.         I have always thought of the Jewett as the design in which Paul Rudolph managed to achieve what Eero Saarinen spent most of his career trying to do, which is to create a version of modernism that would be rich, textured, almost picturesque, and comfortable in its relationship to older buildings around it. Mr. Rudolph's art center sits beside the historic Gothic structures of Wellesley with comfort and ease: this building of red brick and stone trim with concrete grilles is secure enough to eschew the extremes of either imitation or defiance.

Making music against a background of wider artistic, literary and social contexts needs the preparation and thought these events did not receive. This year the festival has lowered its sights. Ideas of time and place remain but in simpler terms. This past week at Avery Fisher Hall, for example, has centered on Mozart's extraordinary outburst of piano concertos in 1784. On Thursday, the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra under Gerard Schwarz offered three of the six. Under Armin Jordan on Friday, a fourth was played.   The concept works: one notes both astonishing variety and shared tendencies. Each of the four was a world to itself, yet in the piano detail and harmonic gestures lay a recognizable mind. The performers were as various as the pieces. All professional pianists learn music's vocabulary of expression, but Helene Grimaud, who played the F-major Concerto (No. 19, K. 459) on Thursday, showed emotions of her own, her heart speaking acutely and specifically with every depression of the keys. Miss Grimaud's quiet playing is especially effective, yet paradoxically, it is slimness of sonority that creates her principal problem: a sound so slight that it almost disappears within the orchestra around her.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940801","headline":"Bosnians Urge Tougher Response to Serb Rejection of Accord","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/01/world/bosnians-urge-tougher-response-to-serb-rejection-of-accord.html","abstract":"  Bosnian Government leaders today criticized the United States and four other major powers for failing to take decisive action against the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting a peace plan.

As cougars repopulate much of their former range, however, they are also encountering humans more frequently. Sometimes there are tragic consequences, as when, in April, one of the big cats ambushed and killed a mother of two children in northern California.

Federal and state law and policy encourage resolution of a foster child's fate within 18 months. But, as presented in a Times series last week, children languish in the system for many reasons, including sluggish child welfare bureaucracies, particularly New York City's Human Resources Administration, and courts that often take a long time to terminate parental rights and free children for adoption.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940802","headline":"Cooper Arrested on Assault Charge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/sports/sports-people-basketball-cooper-arrested-on-assault-charge.html","abstract":"  MICHAEL COOPER, the former Los Angeles Lakers star and current assistant coach, was arrested last week on a charge of battery and assault after allegedly threatening his wife, WANDA, with a vase, according to a Corrales, N.M., police report released today.
