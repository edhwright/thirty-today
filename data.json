By David A. Karp. 240 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $25.    UNLIKE people who suffer devastating illnesses that can be \"documented\" by numbers and pictures, people who suffer severe depression find it almost impossible to articulate their particular experiences of hell because they have  no burn marks to show for it. In his book \"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness,\" David A. Karp contends that the phenomenology of depression is as important to study as the more commonly researched issues of incidence, etiology and treatment. A person does not just wake up one day and announce, \"I am a depressed person.\" Each statement he makes about himself, his depression, his relationships and his future is the result of an evolutionary process in which he assumes an \"illness identity\" over time.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"SPENDING IT;Hitting Some Bumps On the Road to Atlanta","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/business/spending-it-hitting-some-bumps-on-the-road-to-atlanta.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"ON THE STREET;Where Free Spirits Float","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/style/on-the-street-where-free-spirits-float.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Of Renters, Artists and Plumbers;Eviction of an Art Gallery Ignores Artists' Good Deeds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/l-renters-artists-plumbers-eviction-art-gallery-ignores-artists-good-deeds-059153.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"The Perils Of Owning A Home In Splitsville","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/realestate/the-perils-of-owning-a-home-in-splitsville.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Jackie Chan, American Action Hero?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/magazine/jackie-chan-american-action-hero.html","abstract":"WHENEVER JACKIE CHAN LEAVES HONG KONG TO MAKE A public appearance in Shanghai, Taipei or Tokyo, or in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore or Seoul, hundreds -- sometimes thousands -- of his fans gather in a frenzy of adoration. Last June, Chan, the martial artist, comic actor and stunt man who is Asia's biggest movie  star, flew to Los Angeles for MTV's annual Movie Awards. He was met at the airport by about 25 people. Among the signs and banners held aloft, a bright pink strip read: ALL AMERICANS LOVE JACKIE. SOME JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET. \n\n     Martial arts devotees and patrons of Chinatown movie houses have known to love Chan since the late 1970's. More recently, his signature blend of comedy and combat, honed over 43 films, has turned him into a cult icon among a more diverse audience, including Hollywood film makers and Generation X hipsters for  whom high-octane Hong Kong films have become required viewing. At the MTV awards, where Chan was given a Lifetime Achievement Award, Quentin Tarantino heatedly proclaimed him a cinematic virtuoso on the level of Buster Keaton (one  of Chan's acknowledged influences) and Fred Astaire.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Word for Word/Agitprop;The Guys Who Went

The destruction of that village in Dagestan will not intimidate the Chechens but rather embolden them and their neighbors to new and broader actions. It will not consolidate Mr. Yeltsin's authority but rather isolate him still further from democratic forces in Moscow. And it will not strengthen his hand in Washington but rather highlight the impotence of Washington's past uncritical support and be the first step toward a re-evaluation of that approach. \n\n     Pervomayskoye taught the Chechens three lessons: First, Mr. Yeltsin has no interest in a political settlement, cannot be counted on to keep his word, and is prepared to be far more brutal to non-Russians than to ethnic Russians. The Dagestanis, who have stood aside from the Chechen fighting and were initially appalled by the seizure of hostages, have now changed sides because of the brutality of Mr. Yeltsin's actions. As a Dage-stani official told Izvestia, Mr.  Yeltsin's actions will become his \"greatest mistake\" and lead to a wider war in  the Caucasus.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Of Renters, Artists and Plumbers;Don't Pick On Us Renters; We Make the City Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/l-of-renters-artists-and-plumbers-don-t-pick-on-us-renters-we-make-the-city-work-059129.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CARROLL GARDENS;Ratpacks Overrun Third Street","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-carroll-gardensratpacks-overrun-third-street.html","abstract":"Residents of Third Street in Carroll Gardens have welcomed this winter's snow-scoured streets and unrelenting winds.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"The Third Rock From Ursa Majoris","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/opinion/the-third-rock-from-ursa-majoris.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"EVENING HOURS;Antiques, Awards And Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/style/evening-hours-antiques-awards-and-art.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Endpaper;Big Deals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/magazine/endpaper-big-deals.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Of Renters, Artists and Plumbers;Don't Pick On Us Renters; We Make the City Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/l-of-renters-artists-and-plumbers-don-t-pick-on-us-renters-we-make-the-city-work-059129.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"EVENING HOURS;Antiques, Awards And Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/style/evening-hours-antiques-awards-and-art.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"On the Ballot: President and Legislators","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/world/on-the-ballot-president-and-legislators.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Weddings;Wendy G.

While fruitful critical and biographical connections can be drawn between the stories and Yourcenar's formidable oeuvre -- particularly \"Memoirs of Hadrian,\" \"Alexis\" and \"Oriental Tales\" -- the stories also stand on their own.  As translated by Mr. Manguel, the prose of the young Yourcenar is accomplished and her vision arrestingly mature. In the first story, \"A Blue Tale,\" European merchants set out to plunder a cave full of sapphires on a Middle Eastern island only to meet failure, death and destitution. The spare recitation and repeated use of the color blue prove to be haunting features in this fable of greed, in which a woman catches sapphires in her hair for the merchants; after she is cruelly kidnapped, her tears turn to aquamarines. In \"The First Evening,\" initially written by Yourcenar's father and revised by her at his request, a jaded, self-absorbed man travels with his young wife to their honeymoon in Switzerland. His fear of life's banality, which engulfs him as he approaches his conjugal bed, is momentarily abated by a telegram announcing the death of his former mistress, who still preoccupies him. The last story, \"An Evil Spell,\" further reveals Yourcenar's imaginative powers as she describes a witch hunt, set somewhere near the Mediterranean in southern France. Here a woman named Algenare is deemed to have cast an evil spell on a woman she envies. Pointing up the human need for scapegoats, Yourcenar illustrates how naming and becoming are one, as the villagers brand Algenare a witch and Algenare herself finds in the night sky \"in large trembling strokes, the giant letters of the witches' alphabet.\" For its insight into human frailty and vice, for its language forged  with precision and nuance, this slim trio of tales is richly rewarding.

We were amazed not at how small the world is but at how large. We were astounded to find that what I'd cavalierly referred to as a \"quick jump\" from Bangkok to Tokyo turned out to be an overnight flight, and that 20 grueling bus hours separated Buenos Aires from northern Patagonia. Nonetheless, no great  mishaps awaited us in the global vastness. The worst incident of the whole trip  was when I slipped at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok and smashed my camera (which  is why we have no pictures of Japan, where we headed next, and why I strongly recommend sticking a disposable camera in your pack).","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Q. & A.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/realestate/q-a-056510.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"MAKING IT WORK;The Story of My Stabbing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/making-it-work-the-story-of-my-stabbing.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"The 104th Congress at Midpoint: Where Its Major Legislation Stands;SOCIAL ISSUES","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/us/the-104th-congress-at-midpoint-where-its-major-legislation-stands-social-issues.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Lost Trip","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/travel/l-lost-trip-057126.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"DINING OUT;It's Not Your Typical Mexican Cuisine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/dining-out-it-s-not-your-typical-mexican-cuisine.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"ART REVIEW;3 Solo Shows That Bespeak Individuality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/art-review-3-solo-shows-that-bespeak-individuality.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: DEVELOPMENT;Community Consensus for the Navy Yard: Yes on Housing, No on Trash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-development-community-consensus-for-navy-yard-yes-housing-no.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/weekinreview/c-corrections-059099.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Week in Review"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"TRAVEL ADVISORY;U.S. Rules to Improve Safety of Small Planes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/travel/travel-advisory-us-rules-to-improve-safety-of-small-planes.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"L.I.

ANNETTE MESSAGER (Los Angeles County Museum of Art/Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, paper, $24.95), the catalogue to her  first retrospective exhibition in the United States, now at the Art Institute in Chicago, offers a concise introduction to her art. Ms. Messager, whose greatest  influence is the work of the Surrealists, often works in series; photographs and taxidermized animals have been two constants of her introspective and sometimes  menacing artworks. One of her most tender yet macabre early series, \"The Boarders,\" featured an installation of stuffed sparrows in hand-knit sweaters, which she baptized, punished and took for \"walks,\" conflating maternal, childlike and corporal impulses. In the 70's, she tackled themes other artists pursued much later: her photo series \"Voluntary Tortures,\" which documented women's mudpacks and plastic surgeries, anticipated the work of Jenny Saville and Orlan by nearly two decades, and she used jokes and aphorisms as a means of  ironic cultural commentary long before Richard Prince and Jenny Holzer did. Recently, Ms. Messager has combined drawing and stuffed toys in more pointedly political pieces about global issues. Written by the exhibition's curators, Sheryl Conkelton of the Museum of Modern Art and Carol S. Eliel of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, \"Annette Messager\" overlooks some of the artist's  quirkier early works (for \"My Approaches,\" for example, she sat at a cafe table  and photographed businessmen's flies), and it neglects to clarify this proto-feminist artist's relationship to American feminist art of the 70's, many  of whose concerns she shared. Still, it traces the evolution of Ms. Messager's singular vision and confirms her status as one of France's most engaging post-modern artists.

But driving past La Jolla, all one sees is the steep backside of a scrubby hill. It's easy to keep driving, but it would be a mistake: the hill hides one of the coast's most beautiful spots. \n\n     With a name believed to come from the Spanish word for \"jewel,\" this area 12  miles north of downtown San Diego is a treasure of forested hills that roll down to stark, wind-sculptured cliffs, sandy and rocky beaches, and the bright blue Pacific. The natural beauty is startling and vast, but it can be appreciated in  just a weekend of rambling exploration. La Jolla may be a popular tourist destination and a community of 30,000, yet it is possible to feel alone and at peace here, insulated by the rush of waves over rock and the invigorating hiss of cool salt air.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"The 104th Congress at Midpoint: Where Its Major Legislation Stands;EDUCATION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/us/the-104th-congress-at-midpoint-where-its-major-legislation-stands-education.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960121","headline":"WHAT'S DOING IN;Miami","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/travel/what-s-doing-in-miami.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE;Toy Store Gets the Go-Ahead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-side-toy-store-gets-the-go-ahead.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"RACE AND THE MEDIA;Human, All the Same","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/21/movies/l-race-and-the-media-human-all-the-same-056715.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19960121","headline":"RACE AND THE MEDIA;Phony?
