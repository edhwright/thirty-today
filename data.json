Scientists at Pennsylvania State University hypothesize, however, that a present-day flightless insect called the stone-fly may be closely related to ancestral insects that first learned to fly more than 330 million years ago.   Last February, Dr. James H. Marden, a biologist at Pennsylvania State University, and Melissa G. Kramer, his student, began studying the behavior and biology of stoneflies -- the immature nymphs of which are familiar to many fishermen as delicacies for trout. The nymphs begin life in river or pond water and then develop primitive wings enabling them to skim across water at high speed without actually taking to the air. Dr. Marden and Ms. Kramer have concluded that the humble ancestor of such expert fliers as mosquitoes and wasps may have been very much like the stone-fly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941025","headline":"Infant Killed in House Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/25/nyregion/infant-killed-in-house-fire.html","abstract":"  An 18-month-old girl was killed yesterday when a fire engulfed the top floor of her family's two-story row house in East New York, Brooklyn, trapping the infant and her brother, fire officials said.

The Mayor has made impressive headway in reducing the city payroll and negotiating better contracts with city unions. But it is time now to squeeze harder.    If the June reductions were painful, the new cuts will be more so because they carve deeper into programs that have already been trimmed.

His shorts, many evoking Poe or Kafka, bring the menace of the subconscious to life, and his extraordinary feature \"Alice\" depicts an eerie wonderland darker than any Lewis Carroll dared. His new feature, \"Faust,\" combines his usual mix of animated elements with a great deal of live action to tell an updated version of the old devilish story; the result will probably be more intriguing to Svankmajer cultists than to newcomers.    Mr. Svankmajer's Faust (Petr Cepek) is a dour-looking man who lives in today's Prague and is first seen walking out of a subway. He is handed a map with a large red mark on it, and eventually follows the directions to a ramshackle building that conceals an abandoned dressing room.

Yet this gentle ceremony for 26 dancers seemed at home in a house of worship.    Dancers kept sitting on benches at one side of the space like members of a choir. A couple on small platforms struck poses as if they were squirmy saints. The choreography often celebrated communal harmony, especially in passages of jolly hops and in sequences in which everyone danced in a ring and joyfully slapped their knees. At one point, dancers darted forward, buzzing like euphoric bees. And at the conclusion, everyone sang \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941026","headline":"A Significant Stop in Syria","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/opinion/a-significant-stop-in-syria.html","abstract":"  The official reason for President Clinton's trip to the Middle East is to witness today's signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty. But the intriguing stop will be the meeting tomorrow in Damascus with Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad.    White House officials see the treaty signing as a chance to lift the President out of the gloom of a frustrating midterm election campaign and emphasize his recent foreign policy successes in Haiti, North Korea and Iraq. If he can somehow manage to add substance in Syria to ceremony on the Israel-Jordan border, he can improve his Presidential image as well as the prospects for Mideast peace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941026","headline":"Another British Minister Resigns Over Outside Lobbying Deals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/world/another-british-minister-resigns-over-outside-lobbying-deals.html","abstract":"  A junior British Government minister resigned today over reports that he failed to disclose outside lobbying deals, the second junior minister to quit under a cloud in a week, leaving Prime Minister John Major scrambling to limit the political damage from questions about his Conservative Party's ethical standards.

In the three years since rebel troops overthrew a Marxist regime and committed themselves to democratic rule, there have been measurable gains. The government of President Meles Zenawi has cooperated with the World Bank, devalued its currency and begun to open its markets. There is general stability and peace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19941026","headline":"Jordan and Israel sign a peace treaty.","pages":[{"title":"Jordan","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan","description":"Country in West Asia","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Flag_of_Jordan.svg/320px-Flag_of_Jordan.svg.png","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":160},"abstract":"Jordan, officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is a country in the Southern Levant region of West Asia.
