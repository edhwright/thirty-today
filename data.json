Several explanations of \"River's\" success are making the rounds, including the Redford cachet and Brad Pitt's dimples, but in a film about fly-fishing, any serious accounting of its charms must include its tiny, hackled stars -- the flies themselves.\n\nIndeed, it could be argued that casting the roles of the artificial flies for \"River\" required as much artistry as did any of the on-camera casting. From the onset, Redford insisted on using flies that mimicked natural food forms rather than those flies known as \"attractors\" -- crass, overdressed lures which basically annoy trout into striking them. Redford's position, leaked early to the trades (\"Ordinary Bob Nixes Fruit Flies for Fish Pic\"), was part of the aura of integrity that had prevented his movie from being made for 14 years, but authenticity had its price. Indeed, the film was very nearly scuttled when a studio executive, Mark Canton, insisted that the Datchett Razzler, a hideous attractor he had picked up in Aspen, be prominently featured.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930112","headline":"Anse a Galets Journal; Haitians' Hope for Jan. 20: A Fair Wind for Florida","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/12/world/anse-a-galets-journal-haitians-hope-for-jan-20-a-fair-wind-for-florida.html","abstract":"  At the simple concrete wharf that is the only port of La Gonave, a desolate, rock-ribbed island off Haiti, two soldiers shadowed by a clutch of onlookers converged on a visitor to ask if he, like most of the foreigners who infrequently venture here, had come in search of boat people.

The warmth of human feeling flows through its formal structures.   It is also a delicate ballet, so intensely dependent upon perfect execution that any blurring of its classical vocabulary makes it fall into the perfunctory.

Ann Stock, the vice president of public relations for Bloomingdale's, who divides her time between Washington and the New York department store, is Hillary Clinton's choice for a job that to some is as important as the White House chief of staff and, in its own way, wields almost as much power.   Nicki Hedrick, director of media relations at Bloomingdale's, confirmed today that Mrs. Stock had resigned to take the White House job, where she will hold sway over who gets invited to Presidential functions. Mrs. Clinton's office refused to comment on the appointment.   \"If you care about going to the White House it's a very powerful job,\" said Carolyn Peachey, president of Campbell, Peachey & Associates, a public relations firm. Intense Competition    After 12 years in a city where the most sought-after invitation is to a White House dinner, there are a lot of Democrats clamoring to get on the list.   Competition for the social secretary's position was intense. \"It always has been,\" said Sheila Tate, who was press secretary to Nancy Reagan and is now president of Powell Tate, a public relations firm. \"The job has great cachet.\"   Mrs. Stock, a former deputy press secretary to Vice President Walter F.  Mondale, was chosen from a list that included Ms. Peachey, who did not want to be considered; Susan O'Neill, daughter of the former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.; Liz Stevens, wife of the film director George Stevens, and Alma Viator, a vice president of the National Theater.   A number of people prominent in Georgetown's social circle were surprised by the choice, and telephone calls today soliciting their responses often began with comments like the one from Polly Kraft, wife of the lawyer and former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler: \"Do I know her?\" She Knows Washington    Mrs. Stock may not be a household name to the Georgetown crowd, but she has long experience in the capital. \"It's good that no Georgetown ladies know her,\" said Ms. Tate. \"She's fresh and unspoiled. She's a hard worker and she certainly knows Washington.\"   Everyone agrees that the White House social secretary should know Washington so as to navigate the treacherous political waters and the rocky protocol shores.   \"It's very important,\" said Muffie Brandon, now director of corporate programming for the Ford Motor Company and social secretary to Nancy Reagan from 1980 to 1983. \"The intricacies of this city, the nuances of political life and of protocol are not things you can learn on the job.\"    Mrs. Stock is not new to politics or to Washington. Besides working for Mr. Mondale, she volunteered for the Capital Children's Museum and helped raise the money to open it.  Other Qualifications    Those who know Mrs. Stock describe her as energetic, enthusiastic and creative, highly organized and very professional, qualities that are important in such a sensitive job.   \"There are toes that don't need to be stepped on,\" said Ms. Tate. \"You need to genuflect to certain people. It's important that she knows the traps and avoids needlessly offending people, just in terms of the Hill and the traditions and all the protocol.\"   Mrs. Stock, who is 46 and lives in nearby Alexandria, Va., graduated from Purdue University, where she majored in elementary education. She has been married to Stuart Stock, a partner at Covington & Burling, for 22 years. They have a 13-year-old son, Chase, who is a student at the Potomac School in McLean, Va.   She is a member of the Overseas Economic Fund's Women in Business Committee and founded the Washington Woman Roundtable, a group of 1,000 female executives who meet every three months to network. She was founder of Washington's \"Race for the Cure\" against breast cancer, and helped to organize the same event in New York City.   Mrs. Stock could not be reached for comment. She was on her way back to New York from Little Rock, Ark.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930112","headline":"Making Peace Before the Election","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/12/nyregion/making-peace-before-the-election.html","abstract":"  By reaching a contract that provides modest raises for most of New York City's union workers before his re-election campaign begins in earnest, Mayor David N.

But it is parody, not flattery, that is Gerard Alessandrini's forte.

The answer is unveiled at Theater East, where the latest installment of this perennial entertainment is playing. In this case, the pleasures of Mr. Alessandrini's musical indictment are intermittent. There are, however, mirthful sketches beginning with Craig Wells's devastating spoof of Michael Crawford. Remove his mask and he is a singing schizoid, a toe-tapping male ingenue.

President Bush was right to strike, by all accounts cleanly, at surface-to-air missile sites and related communications facilities that menaced coalition aircraft in southern Iraq's no-fly zone. And he was justified in ordering a U.S. battalion-size force to Kuwait. Its troops are a warning that America will stiffen defenses against further border incursions by Iraqi soldiers to grab missiles left behind after Operation Desert Storm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930114","headline":"Court Upholds Shortcut Used in Ousting 2 Judges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/us/court-upholds-shortcut-used-in-ousting-2-judges.html","abstract":"  In a decision effectively upholding the removal of two Federal judges, the Supreme Court ruled 9 to 0 today that the Senate's use of a shortcut procedure for handling impeachments is not open to challenge in Federal court.

The Devils did not know when Nicholls would report to the team.   Nicholls was traded to Edmonton Oct. 4, 1991 with Steve Rice and Luis DeBrusk for Mark Messier and future considerations. He was unhappy with the trade and didn't report to Edmonton until two months later.

There were times when William Black achieved that effect on Tuesday evening when he played works by Bach, Poulenc, Griffes and Schumann at Alice Tully Hall. Yet as counterweights to those transcendent moments, others seemed oddly distant and flat, as if the pianist had spent so much effort conceptualizing the music's structure and contours that he lost sight of its color and depth.   Mr. Black's power of illusion was at its strongest in Poulenc's Nocturnes, eight gracefully descriptive character sketches composed between 1929 and 1938 and not played as frequently as they deserve to be. Mr. Black captured the spirit of each unfailingly and made their extramusical qualities -- a slight impetuousness in the first, mischievousness in the fifth, stateliness in the last -- seem vivid and tangible. In technical terms, too, he was entirely on target. He produced a sound that had a gentle haze, yet the music's textures were clean and unambiguous.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930114","headline":"Met Museum Election","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/arts/met-museum-election.html","abstract":"  Annette de la Renta has been elected a vice chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
