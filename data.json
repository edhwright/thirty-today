But, thanks to a large and unfortunate loophole, not all New Yorkers. Those who patronize the several thousand restaurants that seat 35 or fewer people would not have the privilege of smoke-free dining granted those who eat at bigger, possibly fancier places. Under the bill, customers of the big places may smoke only in the bar area -- and it must be at least six feet from the dining area or separated by a floor-to-ceiling partition. But the smaller places have been given an exemption.   Constructing separate areas for smokers, the small-restaurant owners testified at previous Council hearings, is impractical and impossibly costly for them. It probably is. But there is no reason they can't ban smoking entirely. In the 100 American cities with anti-smoking legislation that does not exempt small restaurants, the law has had little or no effect on their revenues. According to a recent Gallup Poll of 763 adult New Yorkers, a smoking ban might, in fact, increase restaurant patronage and revenues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941207","headline":"In Tough Neighborhood, Boy Recalls What Might Have Been","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/nyregion/in-tough-neighborhood-boy-recalls-what-might-have-been.html","abstract":"Sal Ayala walks to work each day past images of what might have been his future in the shadows of his East Harlem neighborhood and the bustling halls of his high school.\n\n\"I could have ended up in jail or selling drugs, or dead,\" said Sal, a 15-year-old sophomore at the Urban Peace Academy, an experimental public school that opened last fall in East Harlem, where drugs, violence and unwanted pregnancies take a damaging toll on teen-age lives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941207","headline":"Father Testifies on Last Hours Of His Daughter in Hospital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/nyregion/father-testifies-on-last-hours-of-his-daughter-in-hospital.html","abstract":"  Nearly a decade after he filed a malpractice suit against four doctors and New York Hospital in the death of his daughter, Sidney Zion finally had his day in court yesterday to tell of his last hours in the hospital with her, when doctors reassured him that she looked far sicker than she actually was.

The setback raised questions about Mr. Major's ability to advance his legislative agenda and maintain his hold on power.

Mr. Bentsen's clout on Capitol Hill was important to Mr. Clinton's major legislative victories.

It is important to review what these developments mean and do not mean for Mr. Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The downfall of even so close an associate as Mr. Hubbell does not mean that the Clintons have done anything wrong. Similarly, Mr. Palmer seems more closely tied to Jim Guy Tucker, the Governor of Arkansas.

The first installment was \"Orphee,\" an opera that used Cocteau's 1950 screenplay as its libretto. \"La Belle et la Bete\" takes the integration a step farther, using the film itself but replacing its soundtrack with sung dialogue and new music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941207","headline":"COLLEGE FOOTBALL: A Fighter Who Plays Football; Born With No Left Hand, DaWuan Miller Is Boise State Rallying Cry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/07/sports/college-football-fighter-who-plays-football-born-with-no-left-hand-dawuan-miller.html","abstract":"  His mother moved the family five times during grammar school, and the first day of class was always a stare down.

The current fight is over the Mayor's proposed cuts in the $31.6 billion budget adopted in June for the fiscal year that began July 1. City revenue has fallen short of what was then expected, so the Mayor -- as required by law -- has proposed spending cuts to match the loss of revenue.

But skiers tend to be the most avid among them, possibly because their needs are so bottomless. Besides skis or snowboards to choose from, what about the boots, poles, goggles, clothes and the gear to carry it all?   Especially in skiing, the holiday season is a popular time to cache in on new equipment, either from presents received or personal buying sprees. Here are a few suggestions that run the gamut of price and style. Skis    The S Ski comes with an unconventional hourglass figure -- slim at the waist, but broad in the tips and tails. Created by a a new company in Aspen, the skis are made to turn easily and quickly. They are targeted for a wide midrange of skier levels and most snow conditions. The boards have a signature look -- jet black, with a silver S Ski graphic at the tip. Elan and Kneissel make a similar ski shape. Available in two models, the S ski costs $475. To order from S Ski, you can telephone (303) 925-9600 or fax (303) 920-7713. In New York, you can call Scandinavian Ski Shop at (212) 757-8524. Boots    Rather than buying new boots, there is a way now to revitalize the old ones. Raichle Molitar, the Swiss ski equipment manufacturer, has developed moldable liners that fit into most any plastic boot shell. A customized fit is achieved by heating the liners, called Thermoplastic innerboots, as part of the molding process. The liner cools in the shape of the skier's foot, from toe to heel and to the top of the boot. The company has set up convection ovens at ski shops for heating the liners. Available this season in five models, including an innerboot for hard-shell snowboarding boots, the Thermoplastic liners range from $129 to $169. For a dealer location, the number is (800) ANY-FOOT. Goggles    Short of growing a two-day beard, any skier these days can take on the Alberto Tomba look. The Italian ski racer's goggle is now available to consumers through Briko Racing, of Port Washington, L.I. Aptly named the Racing Detector VIP, the Briko goggle comes with a V.I.P. price of $300. Briko also has introduced a less racy model called the Racing Detector, at $100. Both goggles are designed with a 180-degree visual sweep and include Briko's Thrama lens, designed to cut through the flat light that so often turns ski slopes into moonscapes. Both models of goggle are edged in thick foam to absorb shock if a skier falls. The VIP version is made with an outer frame of aluminum, while the regular goggle comes with a hard plastic frame. For a dealer location, the number is (800) GO-BRIKO. Map Holders    Anyone who has tried to use a map to locate trails on an unfamiliar mountain knows the hassle. There are ski poles to put aside, gloves to take on and off, pockets to dig into, jackets to adjust, and chairlifts to hang onto. All the while, the map is flapping in the breeze like a kite on a string. The Launch Corporation of Denver has come to the rescue this year with the Skiersleeve, a plastic see-through vinyl pouch to hold trail maps. The sleeve, made with a black foam backing, wraps around a skier's forearm with Velcro. Once tucked inside, the trail guide is protected from sleet and snow and is easily seen. It is available for $15 at some ski shops nationwide or by ordering directly through Skiersleeve at (800) 322-2930. Ski Racks    Getting to the slopes brings up another need: roof racks. This year, Masco Tech Inc., the automobile equipment manufacturer from Taylor, Mich., has got in on the act. The company, which has traditionally installed the luggage racks that come standard with most vans and sport utility vehicles, is selling roof rack adaptors directly to consumers. Its Append Sport Rack line includes the new Top Wing Ski and Snowboard Carrier, which sells for about $95 at ski shops. The adaptor is made to carry skis on cars or vans that already have a factory-installed roof rack. The carrier comes with brackets that snap onto the standardized rails and cross bars. For a dealer, or to order directly, the number is (800) 4-APPEND.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941208","headline":"Arafat Tells Christopher He'll Act Against Terrorism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/world/arafat-tells-christopher-he-ll-act-against-terrorism.html","abstract":"  Yasir Arafat said the words he was supposed to say today.

No reason to.   He woke beside his wife in their home in North Augusta, S.C., felt the ache in his left leg that has never left him for a single day over this half-century and prepared for work as a state supervisor of job trainees. - \"Sometimes, when people know that I had pitched in the major leagues, and see I have some trouble gettin' around, they ask if I injured my knee playin' ball,\" he said yesterday by telephone. \"I tell 'em, 'Well, no, it was a little something I got in the service, and that's it.' \"   Brissie, now 70 years old, his hair thinning, still big at 6 feet 4 1/2 inches and still looking fit, can walk unaided, though with a slight limp, for short distances. Otherwise, he must rely on a cane or crutches.   And he remembers: It was on Dec. 7, 1944, in the Apennines in central Italy as American soldiers moved up against German positions, that an advance echelon, with the 20-year-old Corporal Brissie, got into trouble.   \"They unloaded everything on us,\" he recalled. \"The shell that hit me killed 11 men. I was the closest when it exploded, but I got mine mostly in the legs. The others were hit mostly in the throat and the head.\"   Brissie crawled to a creek, where he hoped to get some protection, and passed out. He was left for dead until one medic carried him off. In the Army hospital in Naples, a doctor said he must amputate his left leg.   \"Doc, you can't!\" said Brissie. \"I'm a ballplayer. You have to try to find another way.\"   Before entering the military, Brissie had been a promising left-handed high school and then freshman college pitcher at Presbyterian in South Carolina. Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia A's, wrote him while he was in service and promised him a tryout on his return.   The army surgeon, Dr. William Brubaker, who would become a lifelong friend of Brissie's, found a way to save the leg. Brissie was the first person in the Mediterranean theater to be given the new drug penicillin, and Brissie underwent surgery -- the first of 23 operations on his leg -- in which 30 bone fragments and 5 1/2 inches of skin bone were removed.   Now began an amazing story, beginning with his return on a stretcher to America to his wife and infant daughter, seeking to regain his health and use of his leg in veterans hospitals and never forgetting his dream of pitching in the big leagues, though often being told by doctors: \"You must understand your limitations, young man. Think about other things you can do.\"   Brissie began throwing a baseball on crutches. He was soon free of them. He hooked up with a sandlot team in 1946, wore a bulky aluminum brace that was made to protect his leg but drew stares, went through tearful disappointments, then adjusted his pitching stride and learned how to field bunts. He joined the Savannah Class AA ball club and began winning games. In 1947, he was called up to the A's. \"It took my breath away,\" he recalled.   On opening day of 1948, he started against the Red Sox. In the sixth inning, Ted Williams hit a line drive off his leg brace. It made a clanging noise heard throughout the ball park. Brissie collapsed. Williams ran from first base to the mound. \"Are you all right?\" he asked. Brissie looked up from the ground. \"Why don't you pull the damn ball?\" he said. They both laughed.   Brissie, despite battling infections and pain, became a standout pitcher, making the American League All-Star team in 1949. He was traded to Cleveland in 1951 and retired from baseball two years later, refusing to be sent back to the minor leagues.   \"I knew I was a symbol to many veterans trying to overcome problems,\" he said. \"I wasn't going to let them down.\"   Today, Brissie says he identifies in a manner with Jim Abbott, the Yankees' one-handed pitcher. \"He was innovative, and it seemed, like me, he never thought of failing.\" Brissie is also distressed about the baseball strike. \"There's not going to be a winner. That's the tragedy.\"   Last summer, for the first time in nearly 50 years, Lou Brissie returned to Italy, visiting military cemeteries at Anzio and other sites.   \"I found a lot of old friends there, and thought about those times,\" he said. He paused for a moment. \"I didn't handle it as well as I thought I would.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941208","headline":"Orange County Crisis Shakes Bond Market","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/08/us/orange-county-crisis-shakes-bond-market.html","abstract":"  The sudden plunge of Orange County, Calif., into bankruptcy shook the municipal bond market, threatening to make it more expensive for many local governments to borrow.

The soloists sing precisely the same words the original actors spoke, but the lip-synching never quite works and it never quite matters. Individual words simply do not make that much difference in this score.
