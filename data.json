In a written message made public today, Representative Major R. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat, bitterly denounced Mr. Farrakhan's movement as a \"hate-mongering fringe group\" that he said was spreading \"dangerous poison\" and must be repudiated.   He also expressed indignation at the notion that the caucus had ever established a formal relationship with the Nation of Islam, as the caucus chairman, Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, said in September.   Mr. Owens said that Mr. Farrakhan had asked for all three meetings with the caucus, and that most members had insisted that the meetings be kept private out of concern that outsiders would misinterpret their purpose. Unhappiness in the Caucus    Mr. Owens's statement is perhaps the strongest attack on Mr. Farrakhan by a member of the black caucus since a debate erupted over a vitriolic attack on whites, Catholics and Jews by a senior aide to Mr. Farrakhan.   It also is the strongest hint so far at unhappiness among some of the caucus's 40 members over the decision by Mr. Mfume to link the group to Mr. Farrakhan's movement.   A spokesman for Mr. Mfume declined to comment on Mr. Owens's remarks, and said the Congressman had decided to say no more about the matter. Mr. Owens could not be reached for comment today, and aides to several other caucus members declined to discuss the statement on the record.   In September, Mr. Mfume had appeared with Mr. Farrakhan at a black caucus legislative seminar and announced what he called a \"sacred covenant\" between the two groups to work on the problems of blacks in America.   But that relationship came under scrutiny in recent days after Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a minister and representative of the Nation of Islam, delivered a ferocious attack on whites and other religions in a speech in November at Kean College in Union, N.J. Speech Termed 'Repugnant'    In the speech Mr. Muhammad called Jews \"bloodsuckers\" of the black nation and said Pope John Paul II is a \"no-good cracker.\" He also called for blacks in South Africa to rise up and kill whites in that country.   On Thursday, under growing pressure to reject the remarks, Mr. Farrakhan said he was demoting Mr. Muhammad and called his speech \"repugnant,\" \"malicious\" and \"mean-spirited.\" But Mr. Farrakhan stopped short of repudiating the speech, saying it included some \"truths.\"   Reaction to Mr. Farrakhan's remarks among prominent black officials has been muted. The Rev. Jesse Jackson issued a statement Thursday commending Mr. Farrakhan for disciplining his aide and called for an end to harsh words on all sides, but did not address the substance of Mr. Farrakhan's remarks.   In a statement today, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said the organization was satisfied with Mr. Farrakhan's actions and was prepared to believe that he \"is neither anti-Semitic nor racist.\" Again, the statement did not address Mr. Farrakhan's remarks.   The organization's executive director, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., said the N.A.A.C.P. now plans to sponsor a meeting of black leaders that Mr. Farrakhan had previously proposed.   Mr. Owens's reaction today was considerably stronger. In his statement, he said the desire of the caucus and other black groups for public unity was \"being exploited by a frustrated, misguided and unproductive fringe crowd.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940205","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/05/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-092665.html","abstract":"  Carolyn and Michael Leonhart Singer and trumpet player Michael's Pub 211 East 55th Street Manhattan","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940205","headline":"L.I.R.R.

These sound new rules -- the result of years of work by community groups and the City Planning Commission -- would rectify weaknesses in zoning regulations.   The current zoning allows developers to put up very tall residential buildings in exchange for building public plazas at street level. The idea seemed to make sense: give developers a bonus of more stories for their buildings if they provide some public space. Only it didn't work out that way. The plazas turned into extensions of the apartment towers they surrounded, rather than usable space for the public.

Then early this week, Prime Minister John Major and his Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, inexplicably threw a fit. The U.S. Ambassador to Britain was summoned to Downing Street for a harsh lecture, and the British public was treated to the peculiar TV spectacle of a Larry King interview on CNN with Mr. Adams, in which an actor spoke the Sinn Fein leader's responses.    Under British law Mr. Adams can be seen but not heard on television, and instead of challenging this bizarre censorship, CNN cravenly chose to comply. A similar ban in the Irish Republic was allowed to lapse on Jan. 19, and Mr. Adams's voice can now be heard by many Britons with access to Irish radio and TV. If Mr. Major is indeed serious about his Government's new peace initiative on Northern Ireland, he should also be ending censorship and encouraging debate.

Once an honor student with dreams of mainstream success, Mr. Snipes's character sees the heroin overdose of his mother and the complicity of his father in drug trafficking as sealing his fate. Much of the film's power lies in the way the film makers, through Mr. Snipes's psyche, contrast Harlem's revered past before heroin with its misdirected and stifled potential.\n\nMuch like the city that surrounds it, Harlem is haunted by its past. Whether that past is as gloriously upbeat as those with selective memories like to remember is, at least to me, as debatable as whether the present is as unalterably gloomy as conventional wisdom believes. If you view Harlem's past as a landscape strode only by giants named Ellington, Hughes and Powell, it's hard, even foolish, to seek contemporary parallels.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Not the Center Of the Universe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/arts/l-jazz-at-lincoln-center-not-the-center-of-the-universe-066451.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Tom Piazza's essay \"Lincoln Center and Its Critics Swing Away\"  [ Jan. 16 ]  makes a worthwhile esthetic point about the vital tension between individual expression and collective context in jazz.

Place the meat in a deep bowl, add the white wine and vinegar and allow to marinate six to eight hours.    2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    3. Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and pat the beef dry. Heat the oil in a heavy three-quart casserole. Add the beef and brown it on all sides. Remove the meat from the casserole and add the onions and carrots and cook over medium-low heat until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, then add the raisins, ginger, allspice and brown sugar. Add the stock, the reserved marinade and the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to casserole.   4. Cover the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for about two hours, until the meat is tender.    5. To serve, remove the meat from the casserole and slice it. Arrange on a platter. Reheat the sauce and check seasoninings. Add some or all the lemon juice if the sauce does not seem tart enough. Spoon some of the hot sauce over the meat and pass the rest.    6. Alternatively, the meat can be refrigerated overnight in the cooking liquid and the next day the meat can be sliced and the sauce reheated before serving. This will improve the meat's flavor and texture and allow the layer of chilled fat on liquid's surface to be removed and discarded.

In every event, the 15 highest-ranked skiers are seeded and allowed to ski first, which is usually when course conditions are optimal. If conditions are extremely poor, a few luckless, low-ranked skiers are occasionally sent out to ski before the seeded skiers in order to pack down the trail. In a race made up of two runs, the top 15 finishers after the first run reverse order for the second run. THE SETUP: Slalom (a Norwegian word) and giant slalom, both contested over two runs, are known as \"technical\" events because they require skiers to negotiate their way through red- and blue-flagged double poles known as \"gates\" by making dozens of quick, tight turns. A slalom course must have a minimum of 55 gates for men and 45 for women. A giant slalom course is longer, faster and more open, with a minimum distance between gates of about 13 feet as opposed to about two and a half feet in slalom. Each run of a slalom and giant slalom is held on a different course.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/nyregion/c-corrections-100986.html","abstract":"  An answer in the Q & A column on page 32 of the Travel section today about renting apartments in Paris misstates the telephone number for France U.S.A.

THE SETUP: In moguls, skiers race a qualifying and final run down a steep course about two football fields long, cluttered with moguls, or snow bumps, while incorporating two upright jumps. In aerials, the skiers jump off a chute to perform their two jumps (like in skateboarding), and are judged for takeoff, height and distance (called the air of a jump), execution and landing, among other criteria. THE SCORING: For moguls, think figure skating with a clock, complete with music and scoring on a scale of 0 to 7.5 points. Judges decide how well a skier tackles the moguls (50 percent of his score) and the air of the jump (25 percent) and then his total time (another 25 percent). In aerials, the judges, score on air (20 percent), execution and precision (50 percent) and landing (30 percent. THE STRATEGY: In moguls, it's watch out for the bumps while maintaining jumping style; in aerials, acrobatics rule, with somersaults and twists leading the way. THE NAMES: Recovered from major surgery on her right knee, Donna Weinbrecht of West Milford, N.J., is favored to defend her 1992 gold medal in moguls.

Because the work of no other contemporary playwright has been subjected to so much tortured explication, that point must be made immediately. Otherwise, instead of enjoying a superlative Broadway performance, you're likely to become all solemn and defensive, like someone waiting to be hauled up in traffic court.

According to the author, the actress's only child, she was as self-involved and manipulative as one might imagine, yet possessed of a courage and an intelligence that even her detractors might admire. Last year our reviewer, Molly Haskell, called this biography \"the ultimate act of demystification, a startling and riveting work, completing, rather than competing with\" other recent books about Dietrich. One of them, Steven Bach's MARLENE DIETRICH: Life and Legend (Quill/Morrow, $15), also reissued, concentrates on the actress's career as trans-Atlantic superstar and wartime sweetheart. \"One rather special virtue of this book is that if you open it to the right pages in the right mood, you can practically hear the applause still ringing,\" Wilfrid Sheed said here in 1992.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"A French Touch Revitalizes the Menu","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/nyregion/dining-out-a-french-touch-revitalizes-the-menu.html","abstract":"  THE Inn on the Harbor in Cold Spring Harbor has received a much needed shot in the arm from Guy Peuch, a talented French chef formerly of the Water Club in Manhattan.

Whatever their origin, few would dispute the beauty of this balmy archipelago, where misty peaks loom over whitewashed villages and, in the summer months, hydrangea hedges wind like lavender ribbons across verdant hillsides. Temperatures in the Azores average 55 degrees in winter and 74 in summer, ideal for plants and people. Wild ginger, yellow cannas, miniature roses, pink azaleas and heathergrow riotously along the roadsides. With an uncharacteristic thrift of words, William F. Buckley Jr. wrote in his book \"Atlantic High\" that the Azores \"are, quite simply stated, the most beautiful group of islands in the world.\" Yet tourism has remained modest in the Azores: about 122,000 people visited the Azores from January through October 1993, down from 145,000 for the corresponding period the year before.  After a five-hour direct flight from Boston, we touched down in late July on the largest of the Azores: Sao Miguel, reminiscent of New Zealand, Hawaii, even Ireland. \n\nIn Ponta Delgada, the capital of Sao Miguel and administrative center of the Azores, the formidable 16th-century Forte de Sao Bras, guards the harbor entrance. A promenade paved with black and white stones graces the city's waterfront where tourists and local people dip in the immense swimming pool overlooking the harbor. Pedestrian street malls, colorful flower boxes and the numerous Baroque church bell towers hewn from black basalt maintain the old-world character of this city of about 100,000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/residential-resales-067903.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

He stares out from the pages of MILES DAVIS: The Man in the Green Shirt (Holt, $40) with an intensity that is almost tangible. Even as a very young man in a very conventional mid-40's publicity shot, he has fire in his eyes; even as a ravaged-looking sexagenarian, his eyes hidden behind huge sunglasses, he holds himself like a man born for the spotlight. As a visual record of a remarkable career, this book is exemplary. Unfortunately, the photographs accompany a text by Richard Williams that is by turns pedestrian and bizarre (and marred by the occasional factual error). Mr. Williams, a veteran English music journalist who now writes about sports for The Independent, does a workmanlike job of rehashing the salient facts of Davis's life. When he attempts to provide a fresh perspective on the great trumpeter's music and mystique, however, the results can be downright silly. The book's title, for example, is a reference to what Davis wore in the striking photograph that graced the cover of his 1958 album \"Milestones.\" Mr. Williams lucidly explains why this recording was one of the most significant of Davis's career, but wildly overreaches himself by attempting to make the curious case that the picture and the shirt were as significant as the music. For all his heavy breathing, he fails to demonstrate that Miles Davis's green shirt was anything more or less than a nice-looking shirt. Similarly, \"Miles Davis: The Man in the Green Shirt\" is ultimately no more or less than a nice-looking coffeetable book about a brilliant musician.

Every aspect of her schedule, every bite of food, every thought and dream anticipate the ultimate performance. At a time when losing a pair of lucky socks could make most Olympians falter, a whack on the knee nearly robbed Kerrigan of her opportunity to be her best.\n\nI know those tense days before worldwide competition. For seven years and two Olympics, my life was tightly focused around the sport of rowing. The summer before the Barcelona Olympics, our rowing shell was gouged by a forklift after being transported to the world rowing championships in Tasmania, Australia. When I saw all the concerned faces gathered around the boat, I panicked. When I focused on the wounded hull, everything else blurred, including my coach saying that it could be patched. I screamed and cursed and hurled the water bottle in my hand against the boathouse door. It took me a week to calm down and believe the whole year of training had not been wasted.\nA Shift in Sympathy\n\n As I watched Kerrigan's news conference, I knew that beneath her composure, she had to be losing her mind.\n\nBut then the stories implying Tonya Harding's villainy began, and paradoxically, my sympathy shifted to her. Like the female rowers I know who spit, grimace, blow mucus, wring the sweat out of their shirts in the course of hard practice and are generally considered just too big and powerful to be attractive, Harding doesn't fit into any of the acceptable roles for female athletes. I wanted this cigarette-smoking, big-talking, deer-hunting, auto-mechanic, in-your-face, I'm-gonna-kick-your-butt skater to be innocent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Habitats/The Beige Palace of Stapleton; Making a Lemon a Peach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/habitats-the-beige-palace-of-stapleton-making-a-lemon-a-peach.html","abstract":"  ANN WILLIAMS had not smoked in 16 years, but when she started trying to get a mortgage for a huge house on Staten Island that needed work, she started again.

He had just completed a nearly flawless performance in the technical program at the European championships, and his compact frame was quivering with emotion.   This was no exhibition, no routine evening's work in yet another North American arena with only the applause meter as his judge and jury.   This was genuine competition, exactly the kind of forum he had been craving when he sat down with his American agent, Michael Rosenberg, last spring and laid out his plans to regain eligibility for the 1994 Olympics.   While the voluble Rosenberg railed on about the \"high six-figure\" earnings Petrenko would be kissing goodbye during the coming professional season and the damage an Olympic flop could inflict on his future drawing power, the Ukrainian with the Las Vegas, Nev., address calmly turned, and according to Rosenberg, said: \"Michael, I am an athlete. The Olympics says I can come back, so I must go back.\"   End of conversation. End of high six-figure earnings, at least temporarily. 'Nothing to Lose'    \"I have nothing to lose,\" said Petrenko, who turned 24 in June. \"Skating is what I live for.\"   Skating has certainly shaped his life. Born in the Black Sea port city of Odessa in what was then the Soviet Union, Petrenko began working with the coach Galina Zmievskaya at the age of 10. He has never had another teacher, and in the summer of 1992, several months after he won the gold medal in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, their long association took on an added dimension when Petrenko married Zmievskaya's daughter, Nina, in Odessa.   The newlyweds soon set up house in Las Vegas, a city where ice is usually restricted to cocktail glasses. Petrenko picked it as his professional training base because one of his friends was the director of skating at the Santa Fe Ice Rink, which lies in the Nevada desert about 10 miles away from the myriad, man-made distractions of \"The Strip.\"   \"I see a lot of casinos, but I don't play; I don't like to gamble,\" said Petrenko, who owns a comfortable townhouse near the Sante Fe rink in a fenced-in development (Rosenberg prefers the term \"gated community.\")   After headlining a 72-city ice show tour and participating in the 59-city Tom Collins tour, Petrenko flew back to Odessa with Nina in June last year to begin preparations for his third Olympics. Once again, he will be marching behind a different flag in the opening ceremony. Won Bronze in Calgary    In 1988, Petrenko won bronze for the Soviet Union in Calgary, finishing behind Brian Boitano and Brian Orser. In 1992, he won gold while representing the euphemistically titled Unified team. This year, he will be skating for Ukraine.   \"It will be a great chance to skate for a new country; it makes me more happy,\" he said.   Petrenko would be happier still if his surrogate sister-in-law, Oksana Baiul, could soar to a gold medal of her own. Baiul, who won the world championship last year at age 15, was taken in by Zmievskaya in 1992 after losing her mother, Marina, to cancer and her coach, Stanislav Koritek, to a secure job in Canada. (Baiul's father, who is still alive, left the family when she was an infant.)   Petrenko has been supportive of Baiul from the start, supplying her with equipment and financial assistance. The two skaters have developed a close relationship, training together with Zmievskaya for the last five months on the soft, unpredictable ice of the Odessa Sports Palace.   Though some could question Petrenko's decision to train in such conditions (he recently felt obliged to purchase a skate-sharpening machine for the rink), he claims to have never hesitated. \"My family is in Odessa, and all my friends; it's home,\" he said. No Illusions    But Petrenko harbors no illusions about the role of figure skating in a nation where people remain concerned with finding and affording their daily bread.   \"There are no popular athletes in Ukraine,\" he said. \"People are more interested in political situations. Yeltsin and Kravchuk are more popular than athletes. People are too busy thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow.\" He was referring to the Russian president, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Ukrainian president, Leonid Kravchuk.   Perhaps. But when a Russian television broadcaster erroneously reported last month that Petrenko was in danger of not qualifying for the final round of the European men's competition (he ended up winning), hundreds of Ukrainians were interested enough to call the federation and express their shock and dismay.   \"Our director was pretty busy for a day,\" said Vladimir Geraschenko, a spokesman for the figure-skating federation.   Whether Petrenko can bring a psychological lift to his troubled homeland depends a great deal on his ability to skate cleanly. In all his years as a world-class competitor, he has always stumbled in either his original or free program in the big events. In Albertville, he fell on a triple axel in his long program but still won because nobody else kept their feet either.   This time, the competition will be considerably stiffer with Boitano, a healthy Kurt Browning and two emerging talents in Scott Davis and Elvis Stojko.   \"Most of all, I want to be in the Olympics and do a good job of showing my programs,\" Petrenko said. \"What place I get doesn't matter.\"   It might matter to his earning power, but even Rosenberg, the man who monitors the cash flow, has learned to live with that risk.   \"Viktor always laughs with me that he is going to do three more Olympics,\" Rosenberg said. \"I tell him I'll catch up with him when he's 40.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Where a Star Is Born, And Then Ignored","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/sports/the-home-team-where-a-star-is-born-and-then-ignored.html","abstract":"  \"Oy, oy, oy,\" the tour guide said with a heavy sigh.

But it is already beginning to take shape in a studio on the Upper West Side.  WHO?: A Portuguese princess, Catherine became Queen of England in 1662 by marrying Charles II. Through trade with Portugal, she is said to have helped introduce tea to England. And because her dowry included Bombay, England gained entry to India. WHY QUEENS?: During the reign of Charles and Catherine, New York City passed from the Dutch to the English, back to the Dutch, then finally to England again. Kings County (Brooklyn) was named for Charles, and Queens County for Catherine. SIZE: The statue will be about 36 feet tall on a 50-foot-high base. HOW FAR ALONG IS IT?: The project started with a 26-inch clay statuette with succeeding models that size in plaster, wax and then bronze. Enlarged by the sculptor in stages for adjustments in its proportions, the statue is now in its second size, four feet tall. The next incarnation will be at 10 feet tall, followed by full height. SYMBOLISM: Catherine stands atop a large globe and holds a smaller one in her left hand, which convey her role in bridging the old and new worlds and also represent the diversity of Queens today. THE BOTTOM LINE: $1 million; cost of base unknown. WHO'S PAYING?: The Government of Portugal donated $270,000, and $730,000 more is to be raised there. American donors will be asked to pay for the base. FACING: Undecided. The artist wants a rotating base to give Catherine a one-quarter turn with each season. SPONSOR: Friends of Queen Catherine, a nonprofit organization promoting her contributions and Portuguese-American ties. UNVEILING: Planned for 1998, the 100th anniversary of the consolidation of Queens into New York City.

MEDIA: Giant colorful ads with quirky statistics about Times Square -- 215,326 light bulbs, 3,537 lawyers, 1 Dave (Letterman) -- will be posted on buses around the city. One-minute radio spots will be broadcast for two weeks and will echo the theme: \"This neighborhood's got it all and it's getting better.\" Some 10,000 copies of a glossy brochure will be distributed to businesses like hotels, real estate agents, travel agencies and billboard companies. A new area restaurant guide will be distributed to hotels, visitors bureaus and similar places. CREATOR: Grey Entertainment and Media Inc., a subsidiary of Grey Advertising. COST: $142,000, paid for by the Business Improvement District. MARKET: Not so much the 20 million-plus visitors who come to Times Square each year.

EMBLEN GROWTH OF A THEATER    After opening as a vaudeville house in 1927, the Ritz Theater in Oaklyn switched to popular Hollywood movies in the 1940's. Foreign films were on in the 50's and 60's, X-rated films in the 70's.    Envisioning something live and legitimate at the Ritz, Bruce A. Curless leased the playhouse in 1986 and scheduled a season of theater. It attracted 701 subscribers. Last season's figure, 3,582, has been surpassed this season, said Nancy Seavy, the theater's public relations representative.    Subscriptions are still coming in, she said, for the current year, which began on Jan. 7 with \"On the 20th Century,\" the flamboyant, stylish 1978 Broadway adaptation of the celebrated 1930's play and film.   With unorthodox Cy Coleman music, Art Deco designs that duplicate the luxury chromium-plated train of legend and performing requirements ranging from showy tap to high tessitura, this is the Ritz's most venturesome show yet.    \"We couldn't have done it eight years ago,\" Mrs. Seavy said. \"For this show, we can't have actors who can't sing, or singers who can't act. But now we're attracting talent that can handle it. And we've grown into a significant theater -- the only one known for big-time musicals in southern New Jersey.\"    Not that the Ritz puts on musicals only. \"Lend Me a Tenor\" will follow \"20th Century,\" which plays today at 2 P.M. and Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $10 for the matinee and $12 for evenings.    \"Private Collection,\" a new series, is being added this season. It willconsist of \"Sweet Sue,\" by A. R. Gurney, from Feb. 18 to Feb. 20; a Shakespeare sampler, from April 8 to April 12, and a monthlong festival of music and dance programs, children's productions and one-act plays in June.

They are polite about it, in their generally excellent English, but they let her know they recognize her as the winner of three Olympic gold medals. She thinks she likes the attention.   \"It's very unique,\" Blair said recently. \"These people know you in your uniform, they know your skating style, they know your times, they know you in street clothes.

Only two years have passed since the last Winter Games in Albertville, France. Many athletes have remained in training, not having to shelve their Olympic hopes for the customary four-year wait. Bonnie Blair and Alberto Tomba are back hoping to win their fourth and fifth gold medals; Dan Jansen is back, too, still hoping to win his first. The idea behind this Olympic restructuring, the separating of the Winter Games from the shadow of the Summer Games, was partly to give the smaller, quaint Winter Olympics their own identity. Now they have one. The wrong one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Provoking New Skirmishes In an Endless War of Styles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/arts/recordings-view-provoking-new-skirmishes-in-an-endless-war-of-styles.html","abstract":"  ANDRAS SCHIFF'S recordings of Bach's French suites and keyboard concertos are likely to provoke new skirmishes in music's obsessive war of styles. From experiments in the new to explorations of the past, the how seems to take precedence over the what these days. The way we do things, in other words, overshadows the spirit in which we do them. Just as the avant-garde busies itself with the machinery and electrical circuitry of music-making, so proponents of period instruments and usage have made historically accurate methodology the groundwork for a new musical morality.   Mr. Schiff, a pianist, is asking for trouble, for he is performing Bach on an instrument that in the composer's time existed only as the crudest of prototypes. Early pianos, with their nascent ability to respond to the performer's touch in a forceful way, impressed Bach not at all. Bach's public keyboard instrument other than the organ was the harpsichord. For private entertainment he chose the faint-sounding and ever sensitive clavichord.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Signs Signal Both Profit and Controversy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/signs-signal-both-profit-and-controversy.html","abstract":"  THE best-known 7,200 square feet along the East River in Hunters Point, Queens, have been under reconstruction recently in a factory on 12th Avenue in Manhattan, not far from the Hudson River.

Bobby Hebert, a late replacement for the injured Troy Aikman in the Pro Bowl, engineered a pair of second-half scoring drives yesterday to lift the National Conference to a 17-3 victory over the American Conference in Honolulu. The Atlanta Falcons' quarterback completed 4 of 6 passes for 68 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter of the Minnesota Vikings 1:19 into the final quarter.

Boys and Girls captured the Brooklyn team title with Rohan Hepburn leading the Kangaroos with firsts in the 1,000 (2 minutes, 32.2 seconds, second fastest in the United States this year) and 1,600 (4:28.8). In the Bronx P.S.A.L. meet at the same site, Rob Overby won two events, the 55 meters (6.3 seconds) and 300 (36.6 seconds), to pace DeWitt Clinton to the team title.    Seton Hall Wins Team Title: Flirtisha Harris led Seton Hall to its fourth consecutive team title in the Metropolitan Intercollegiate women's championship at Seton Hall's field house yesterday. St. John's was a close second, scoring 22 points in the final event, the heptathlon, to finish with 136 points to Seton Hall's 141, and Manhattan was third with 128. Harris, a Seton Hall senior, won the 55-meter dash in 6.94 seconds 0.01 off her meet record, lowered her own meet record in the 200 meters to 24.04 seconds and anchored the Lady Pirates' 4x400-meter team to victory with a 54.6 carry.

His voice, which flows steadily throughout the evening of sleight-of-hand tricks he is performing at the tiny Second Stage Theater, is calm, softly rough-edged, self-amused and distinctly nontheatrical.   For much of his enthralling one-man performance, \"Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants,\" which has been directed by David Mamet, one has the feeling of being less in a theater than in the apartment of a new, mildly eccentric friend who has brought you up to demonstrate aspects of a beloved hobby.
