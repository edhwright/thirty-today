A decade earlier, the four Firesigns -- Philip Austin, Peter Bergman, David Ossman and Philip Proctor -- had ruled the world of underground radio and smoky all-night listening sessions around college dorm-room turntables. Their densely textured, politically charged, pun-filled and omnivorously allusive \"ear-plays\" broke from conventional stand-up schtick the way \"Sergeant Pepper's\" transcended Top 40. The four Firesigns (all fire signs, though the name also had nice subversive overtones) became comic seers to the generation that started attending college, smoking dope and questioning authority when Richard M. Nixon was President.   By the early 1980's, that generation had mutated into yuppiedom and the Firesign Theater seemed as dated as the media of its success: underground radio and vinyl records. A different comedy was booming, blunt and visceral, filled with cocaine jokes instead of surreal stoned narratives. The new crowds lacked the inclination, or maybe the attention span, to follow Firesign's long, loopy, literate audio labyrinths.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"DINING OUT;\nInventive Fare for Small or Big Appetites","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/dining-out-inventive-fare-for-small-or-big-appetites.html","abstract":"SITUATED in the thick of things, this engaging new place seems to be a meeting point for diners in mid-county, and with good reason.

Three defiant members of the organization were injured in the attack, which sent bystanders fleeing. The incident drew more attention to the Latin Kings, an organization of Hispanic and Italian men and women founded four years ago within the state's prison system. Over the last two years authorities have linked the band to scores of assaults and at least six homicides. As reports of the group's activities surfaced in the news media, Beatrice Codianni of New Haven, a longtime supporter of grass roots politics, took note. What she read and heard, she said, mirrored the days when she worked with the Black Panthers in the late 1960's and witnessed the Federal Bureau of Investigation discredit the organization by circulating distorted information to the public.   The same pattern was occurring with the Latin Kings, which was a relatively young organization in Connecticut having what Ms. Codianni called positive goals. Though she recognized that the group had a violent element, she said she had also seen how it had changed the lives of people like her 21-year-old son Andrew, by steering him away from drugs and giving him a strict moral code to live by. In May of last year Ms. Codianni began corresponding with Pedro Millan, one of the founders of the Latin Kings who is currently awaiting trial in a state prison on conspiracy charges stemming from the Meriden shootout. She suggested to him that the Latin Kings begin a public campaign to change their image, and that they begin by offering AIDS education along with literacy and high school classes to its members. Ms. Codianni soon after joined the organization and now serves on the board of directors, making her one of the Latin Kings highest ranking members.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"In Brooklyn's District 15, Divisions of the City Are Reflected in the Campaign","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/in-brooklyn-s-district-15-divisions-of-the-city-are-reflected-in-the-campaign.html","abstract":"  Six months ago, the board of School District 15 in Brooklyn so angered some parents by approving a modified version of the Rainbow Curriculum that the police had to escort board members out when their meeting ended.

The strategy, clearly visible at a U.A.W. conference last week, is critical for survival, the union leadership says. But some union officials and members say the new approach, and a willingness to bend traditional union goals in other areas, could end up destroying the union rather than saving it. Adapt, Rather Than Confront    The debate between union leaders who consider themselves flexible and willing to adapt to the auto makers' needs and those who prefer a more traditional militancy makes the U.A.W. a testing ground for organized labor.

Foreigners living in or visiting Japan from the 1870's onward were the first to appreciate and collect these paintings; more than 200 of them now held by the British Museum are reproduced, in color, in UKIYO-E PAINTINGS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM (Smithsonian Institution, $39.95). Courtesans of the Yoshiwara pleasure district of Tokyo are the predominant subjects. In his introduction, Timothy Clark, a curator at the museum, describes the government-licensed brothel quarter, which opened in 1617, and something of the lives of the women indentured there. He notes that the idealized images of    ukiyo-e    -- meant to extol the amusements of the quarter and the charms of its highest-ranking prostitutes -- did not show \"the seamier side of the prostitution industry that is known all too well to have existed from diaries, popular literature and other written sources.\" Indeed, plate after plate depicts elegant women lounging about waiting for their patrons, reading love letters or strolling to houses of assignation. The elaborate designs of their kimonos and sashes are far more expressive than their stylized facial features. Also in this collection are paintings of craftsmen at work, landscapes, a selection of forgeries and some erotica. Students of art history will appreciate Mr. Clark's detailed notes on the artists. And we can thank him as well for his candor in declaring that the primly titled \"Maids Seduced by Workmen\" is, in fact, a painting of a rape.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"The State's Drug Companies Face New Political Environment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/the-state-s-drug-companies-face-new-political-environment.html","abstract":"  WHILE the rest of the Connecticut economy languishes, pharmaceutical research is growing across the state.

The room we were assigned was elegant but completely filled with a king-sized bed, an armoire, an overstuffed chair and a desk. When the rollaway bed was squeezed in, the room was cramped and awkward. The management told us there was little variance in the size of the rooms -- just in the location and view.

To understand it is not necessarily to love it. Still, as the work of an architect who has labored long, and with notable success, to pitch his ideas beyond mortal understanding, the viewer-friendly Greater Columbus Convention Center comes as a pleasant surprise. Visitors familiar with Eisenman's past enigmas -- staircases stuck to the ceiling or leading to a blank wall -- may find themselves bowled over by waves of gratitude. Fortunately, legibility isn't all this building has going for it. It brings a brash, poetic order to a chaotic urban landscape, shaping a middle ground between a city and the forces that threaten it. Plus, it's got snazzy looks.   Ten years ago, opacity was Eisenman's pure delight. His exercises in abstract form did not just ignore the usual conventions of function, context and meaning. They deliberately thwarted those conventions. Their function was to have no function; their meaning was to be meaningless; they arose within the context of no context. Eisenman has not abandoned his fascination with abstract forms. The Convention Center is a formally exuberant building. What he has abandoned, at least for now, is the adolescent idea that conventions are the enemy of architecture. He's discovered that conventions can be played with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"Gymru and Cymru and All That","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/travel/gymru-and-cymru-and-all-that.html","abstract":"THE most intimate way to experience a country is through its language.

Around the age of 19 he married and set about fathering 11 children; the marriage ended 20 years later, when his wife, Adell Brent, left him. Soon after that, the man who in his own words \"was born drawing,\" and who made his living as both a sign painter and a field hand, began a visual lament that continues to this day.

Mr. Robertson is convinced that his wife is an adulterer and apparently does not let a day go by without proclaiming this in words and drawings that fairly quiver with wrath and anguish. \"I married a snake\"; \"Adell made me loose my auto, next loose my truck, last my house,\" and others more clinical or specific in their charges.

As a corporate pilot for Primerica and most recently Dun & Bradstreet, Mr. Milano has flown around the world half a dozen times as captain of Gulfstream and Falcon jets. And because of his flexible schedule as a corporate pilot, in which he flies only 8 to 11 days a month, he has had time to develop a business of his own, Ardsley Mobil Automotive Service Center, which he says is the only high-technology service station of its kind in Westchester.    \"What gives us that distinction is a brake-testing machine I had installed after I bought the station seven years ago,\" Mr. Milano said. \"It is an extremely sophisticated and expensive piece of equipment, which cost us $35,000, but technically it is the state of the art,\" he said. \"This level of equipment isn't for the average service station, but we wanted to attract demanding customers. We excel in Jaguar repairs, and I thought it would be a great marketing tool. There are only four machines of its kind in all of New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\"    For the mechanically ungifted, Mr. Milano described the brake tester as \"a computerized machine that literally gives customers an 'EKG' profile of their cars.\" The process is the same, he said. \"When the car goes up on the rack, the brake tester makes a diagnosis in as little as a minute. But in that time the car is weighed. The wheel alignment on all four wheels is checked; the brake-system performance is analyzed, and then all the information is cranked out in a computerized report.\"  Satisfaction and Profitability    The printouts, he said, which are given to the customer, enable them to monitor their car's performance.    \"There are a lot of things that can go wrong with a car,\" he said. \"If a customer is driving to Florida, for instance, and has car trouble, the print-out contains valuable information that will be useful to a strange mechanic.\"    The brake tester, he said, is paying its way in customer satisfaction and profitability. \"It yields so much important information that even car dealers and other service stations bring in their cars to us for a testing.\"    Customers having work done on their cars are not charged extra for an inspection on the brake tester, Mr. Milano said, but someone wanting only a checkup would be charged $40 plus tax. The hourly labor rate varies from $65 to $75 depending on how \"exotic\" the car is.   Mr. Milano, who is 35, said he has been working at the station in one guise or another more than half his life. \"When I was in school I had a part-time job there,\" he said. \"The station is a landmark in Ardsley. There has been a service station on the same corner since 1926. It was previously known as the F.H.L. Service station when it was owned by Floyd Lichtenberg, when I was a kid. Many years later I bought it from Mr. Lichtenberg.\"  A Changing Industry    But, he said, the station he worked in as a teen-ager bears little resemblance to the one today. \"Those 'Gasoline Alley' days are gone,\" Mr. Milano added. \"I remember when I was in high school, everybody with even a slight mechanical bent used to tinker with their cars. But today, you can't monkey with a car. It's even impossible to change carburetors because high-tech computer microprocessors control their function.\"    A few years after he bought the station, Mr. Milano said, he realized the best way to keep business growing was to upgrade the service. \"The industry was changing,\" he said. \"It was becoming so specialized that technicians were needed to service cars instead of mechanics. It was expand or die. We decided to expand.\"    Using their own money, Mr. Milano and his wife, Isabel, who is his partner and takes care of the bookkeeping and business end of the business, invested about $750,000 to remodel the 5,000-square-foot building with five king-size bays.    \"At the station we only do mechanical work,\" Mr. Milano said. \"We're set up like a dealership in that every car we work on gets dealer parts, and every car we service is tested on the brake machine for free.\"  Jaguars a Specialty    Customers come from all over the county and include many Jaguar owners. \"Jaguars once had a bad rap for always being in the shop,\" Mr. Milano said. \"But they have been vastly improved. We service both the brand-new models and the classics. We even find original parts for the classics, but like any other high-powered car, they both need periodic checkups. The way I started servicing Jaguars is that some of the executives I fly for brought their Jaguars in, and through word of mouth other Jaguar owners followed.\"   In addition to the equipment that he has installed, Mr. Milano employs 21 technicians. \"They receive ongoing training weekly at an automotive facility,\" he said. \"They also have a library of service manuals, electronic technical service bulletins and access to a technical hot-line service.\"   He continued: \"We're not talking about mechanics, but highly skilled, highly educated individuals who are looking not for jobs but careers here. They earn $35,000 at the beginning and can work up to $70,000 with full benefits included.\"  Fascination With Jet Engines    The connection between his own two careers, he said, is his mechanical ability. \"It was the mechanical aspects of flying more than the romantic idea that attracted me,\" he said. After graduating from St. John's University in Queens, with a bachelor's degree in administration, Mr. Milano continued his studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. \"Embry-Riddle is known as the Harvard of the aeronautics industry,\" he said. \"I went there because I was fascinated with jet engines.\"    Two years later, Mr. Milano graduated with an associate degree and received a license as a commercial pilot and flight instructor.    \"My first job was with a Cessna dealer teaching classes of 10 students how to fly,\" he said.  Victims of the Recession    The planes he flies for corporate clients have all been based in hangars at Westchester County Airport.    \"What isn't common knowledge is that the Westchester Airport is the largest corporate jetport in the world,\" he said. \"And when it comes to the travel activities of executives, corporations prefer to keep a low profile.\"    Recently, he said, more than one corporate jet had become a victim of the recession. \"When corporations have to cut back, the $30 million jet may be one of the first things to go,\" he said. \"A lot of corporations are using commercial airlines today, which is another reason I am very glad to have a business. We expect to do $1.5 million to $2 million in sales this year, which is up 20 percent from last year's figures.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"NEW JERSEY GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/new-jersey-guide.html","abstract":"JAZZ HALL OF FAME\n\nCab Calloway, Danny Barker and Jonah Jones are among the musicians who will be inducted into the American Jazz Hall of Fame, and they have been invited to attend the ceremony and concert this evening at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"Elizabeth Bishop's Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/books/l-elizabeth-bishop-s-art-481593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Richard Tillinghast, in his review of \"Elizabeth Bishop,\" by Brett C.

Moats, as the archeologist Robert Croft put it in a recent telephone interview, were \"the medieval equivalent of having a Mercedes\" in the driveway.\n\nBritain's medieval moats were most commonly dug around manor houses, more often to provide security against thieves and thugs than against rampaging armies, according to \"Moated Sites\" by David Wilson.

House 1. Line-Item Veto: Procedural vote to allow consideration of a bill giving the President watered-down line-item veto powers. Approved 212 to 208, April 28. 2. Line-Item Veto: Vote on a Republican alternative proposal that would give the President the authority to veto individual items in spending bills and individual tax breaks targeted at special interests in tax bills and would require a two-thirds majority to overturn a veto. Rejected 219 to 198, April 29. 3. Line-Item Veto: Vote on a Democratic sponsored line-item veto bill.

For Miss Brown and other leaders of what was the 1960's dance avant-garde, art is more concerned with process than product, and \"Astral Converted\" is actually a modified and extended version of her 1991 piece, \"Astral Convertible.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/nyregion/c-corrections-204593.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Thursday about two fund-raising events for the New York City mayoral race referred incorrectly to the parents of Andrew J.

For her return engagement to the club, Miss Caven has peeled off most of the makeup and has polished her singing. Instead of coming across like an eccentric ruin, she now projects more the image of a chanteuse with a mischievous glint who lightly mocks the melodramatic cabaret mannerisms that inform her style.    Miss Caven's opening-night performance on Tuesday, for an engagement that extends through Saturday, was completely riveting. Backed by a quartet that included piano, violin, saxophone and bass, she sang a largely German program that featured songs by Peer Raben (who composed the music for many films by the director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, to whom Miss Caven was briefly married) and J. J. Schuhl. With titles like \"Trans-Europe Tango\" and \"Polaroid Cocaine,\" these songs are parodies of German art songs and offer deliberately cartoonish images of decadent European night life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/nyregion/chronicle-200293.html","abstract":"  In the latest installment of the saga of DONALD and IVANA TRUMP, the former couple kissed and settled the disputes that have kept them in court since they divorced in 1991.

In the most hopeful sign in months, the recalcitrant leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has signed the international peace plan designed to end fighting in the Balkans.    If the Serbs really mean to halt their genocidal onslaught, this is indeed a diplomatic triumph. Under the peace plan approved yesterday in Greece, the Bosnian Serbs would be forced to yield roughly a third of the territory they have seized and would be denied the corridors they seek to link Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"For Yankees, Victory Is a Walk in the Park","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/sports/baseball-for-yankees-victory-is-a-walk-in-the-park.html","abstract":"  Here was the classic Little League confrontation at Yankee Stadium: a shy batter, reluctant to swing at intimidating pitches with the bases loaded, the score tied and two outs in an extra inning.   \"It was the first time in my life I've seen a hitter get up with the bases loaded in the last inning with no intention of swinging the bat,\" said Norm Charlton, the bully, the Seattle pitcher.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"New York's School Election: What Do We Want for Our Kids?; Fight the Moral Decay","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/opinion/l-new-york-s-school-election-what-do-we-want-for-our-kids-fight-the-moral-decay-221593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Juxtaposing your extremely moving \"Children of the Shadows\" series with several recent news articles on the controversy over the involvement of the \"religious right\" in the forthcoming New York City school board elections, I perceive a useful lesson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/nyregion/chronicle-984293.html","abstract":"  They are improbable partners: KURT VONNEGUT and Igor Stravinsky, but their words and music will come together on Thursday at Alice Tully Hall at the premiere of a new version of \"L'Histoire du Soldat\" by the New York Philomusica Chamber Ensemble.

Ms. Rivera plays the title role, a B-movie queen in a Louise Brooks bob who stars in the celluloid reruns that Molina conjures to pass the time of his incarceration. This means that she gets to pop on stage every scene or two in musical parodies of 1940's movie schlock (music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb) and to wear costumes that include a scanty, yellow feathered jungle skirt and headdress, a czarina's silk gown and, most persistently, a horror picture's spider bodysuit befitting her status as the evening's symbolic angel of death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930504","headline":"Observer; A Case Of Eerie Leakage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/opinion/observer-a-case-of-eerie-leakage.html","abstract":"  Does anybody else here have leaking TV cable?

NEW YORK CITY A HOLDING BUDGET IN AN ELECTION YEAR   Mayor Dinkins releases a $31.4 billion budget for the next fiscal year, one that relies on modest spending cuts and promises of state and Federal aid to close a $2.1 billion gap. The strategy enables him to avoid layoffs or large cuts in city services during the year that he is up for re-election. A1. SIX KILLED, THEN SET ON FIRE   Six people, including a baby, were beaten, stabbed and strangled in their East Harlem public housing apartment. Then the place was set on fire, apparently in an attempt to conceal the crime. A1.  ASSAULT CHARGES DISMISSED   A judge dismissed assault charges against a Hasidic Jew who was accused of being part of a group who beat a black man, Ralph Nimmons, last year in Crown Heights.
