Although dancing under the stars can be pleasant, not all dance groups and public spaces are made for each other.    That became clear on Saturday night when Matthew Nash Music and Dance appeared in Brooklyn at the band shell in Prospect Park.

In its second set last Tuesday at Sweet Basil (88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village), the band didn't present even a shadow of its former self. The group now features the saxophonist James Spaulding on various instruments, often flutes, and three African-style drummers, and it opened its set with 30 minutes of Mr. Spaulding fooling around on flute over the percussion.

But whatever lies behind it, the policy announced Saturday is sure to undermine badly needed economic reform in the former Soviet Union.   Under the plan, the bank would let Russians swap small amounts of pre-1993 rubles for new rubles, but would confiscate large ruble holdings. The policy was presented as a way to clamp down on inflation by cutting down excess ruble holdings in Russia and stemming the flow of rubles from neighboring republics. But this rationale is transparently lame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930727","headline":"Chess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/arts/chess-389793.html","abstract":"  There is almost nothing you can absolutely count on in chess; there is almost nothing to which there is no exception. Take the endgame: It is the phase of a game where, in general, quite a lot of material has come off the board and there are no mating attacks. Yet often a situation has to be treated as an endgame even though just a few pawns and the queens have been exchanged. Moreover, in a position that has been dominated for more than 20 moves by slow maneuvering, the chance for a mating attack can dramatically arise, even when there are only a few pieces left on the board.   So you must be alive to whatever fluctuating concrete opportunities come up, no matter what the general situation may be. The game between the Manhattan grandmaster Joel Benjamin and Aviv Friedman of Israel in the International Open Tournament in Marigot on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, from May 1 to May 8, shows how a mating attack can stunningly intrude into a quiet endgame.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930727","headline":"Observer; Failure in Chic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/27/opinion/observer-failure-in-chic.html","abstract":"  I learn from Styles of The Times, my favorite guide to up-to-date dressing, that it is no longer de rigueur to have your jacket sleeve sewn to your jacket.

The lines between fact and fiction have become so blurred nowadays that many readers are likely to shrug off Mr. McGinniss's startling acknowledgment that in creating his portrait of the Massachusetts Democrat, he has \"written certain scenes and described certain events from what I have inferred to be his point of view,\" despite the fact that he did not even interview the Senator for the book.

During the weekend, Mr. Dinkins held a fund-raiser, played tennis and met Barbra Streisand and friends for dinner and movies. They watched \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Cliffhanger.\" The Political Wars    But New York's political wars did intrude a bit. Responding to criticism by Rudolph W.

The investigating judge, BERNARD BEFFY, questioned BORO PRIMORAC, former coach for Valenciennes, on Primorac's charge that Tapie offered him money and career opportunities to become a scapegoat. The encounter was expected to last several hours.   The Primorac affair is the only part of the bribery scandal directly implicating Tapie, who called the coach a liar and accused prosecutors of taking a new tack in trying to destroy

Havana insists this money has to be handed over before direct calls from Florida are permitted. But one good turn deserves another. Cuba can reciprocate Washington's gesture by putting the escrow issue on hold. It could earn as much as $15 million in the first year of the new telephone operation and gain good will among exiles who are eager to speak with cooped-up kinfolk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930728","headline":"The Human Drama Overshadows Russian Politics : A Coup for 'Misha's Party'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/28/style/IHT-the-human-drama-overshadows-russian-politics-a-coup-for-mishas.html","abstract":"\"Misha's Party\" (in the Barbican Pit) is an unusual collaboration between the American dramatist Richard Nelson and the Russian playwright Alexander Gelman.

Instead, Christopher Keene will conduct the American premiere of the score as it was performed at its world premiere at La Scala.    That version had only a single performance, on Feb. 17, 1904, and was booed off the stage for a complicated combination of reasons. The audience found its Wagnerian-length acts too long, and objected to the absence of a tenor aria. Some listeners derided the Japanese folk elements, and criticized other sections of the work as warmed-over \"La Boheme.\" And some objected to the brutality and outright nastiness with which Puccini and his librettists, Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica, described this tragic meeting of East and West.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Questions On Signing Up New Voters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/nyregion/questions-on-signing-up-new-voters.html","abstract":"  In an often partisan hearing, State Senate Republicans yesterday sharply questioned the credibility of a former New York City Board of Elections official who now works for Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign and raised concerns about whether duplicate registrations and other irregularities could skew a close race this fall.   At the hearing at the State Office Building in lower Manhattan, Board of Elections officials acknowledged that they had found as many as 22,000 duplicate registrations on file in the city between the time of the Presidential election last fall and this spring, but they said that a random check of 180 of them had found no evidence that any of those registrants had voted twice. They said they were weeding out the duplicates from the three million voters on the rolls. Duplicate Registrations    For years the board has been plagued by administrative problems, and Senator Michael F. Nozzolio of Seneca Falls, the chairman of the Senate's Elections Committee, called the hearing to examine recent reports of sloppy record-keeping and potential irregularities, especially in the wake of big voter registration drives last year. Aides to the Republican-Liberal mayoral nominee, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who lost in 1989 by less than 50,000 votes, have repeatedly claimed there is potential for outright fraud, arguing that duplicate registrations, particularly in heavily black districts, could hurt their candidate this fall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Hentrich: Punt, Pray And Kick","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/sports/pro-football-hentrich-punt-pray-and-kick.html","abstract":"  After a college career at Notre Dame, Craig Hentrich should have no problem punting or kicking before a large crowd and a national television audience.

By that measure, Aguiar ranked third in the American Conference and fifth in the league, with 37.6 yards. Still, there is a perception that Aguiar's job is in jeopardy because of Hentrich's mere presence in camp.

Simmons will have the surgery today to repair torn cartilage he suffered during Monday morning's workout. A test Tuesday revealed the tear. Simmons was the 15th player selected in the draft and had been slotted to start at left outside linebacker.   \"It'll set him back a little bit, certainly,\" Holmgren said. \"But we're talking four to six weeks and he'll be back in there at the beginning of the season.\"   In Simmons's absence, the Packers will start Jeff Brady, a third-year man. A knee injury limited him to 8 games and 18 tackles last year. (AP) San Francisco 49ers    What is a trip to a foreign land for his teammates is a homecoming of sorts for the San Francisco 49ers' offensive tackle James Parrish.   Parrish, a veteran of the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football and now struggling to win a spot on the 49ers, said he was mobbed by young autograph-seekers during an evening walk on the Ramblas, the city's jammed promenade.   \"It's great, I'm just glad to be back in the city and see some of my old friends,\" Parrish said before the 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers scrimmaged at a practice for their American Bowl game in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday.   \"All the guys on the team know I played here and know the city and the people -- and my Spanish is pretty fluent,\" said Parrish, who played for the Dragons before the W.L.A.F. folded after the 1992 season. Parrish was cut last season by San Diego after he spent the 1991 season on Miami's \"physically unable to perform list.\" (AP) Miami Dolphins    At first it looked as if it were just another scuffle during two-a-day drills in Davie, Fla. Hot, tired and suddenly angry, Huey Richardson reached out and grabbed offensive guard Charles Hope's face mask. Then Richardson ripped it off, and the message was clear -- he'll fight to keep his career alive.   Richardson, a former Florida Gators star, is trying to win a job at defensive end with the Miami Dolphins, his fourth team in three years. He was a bust with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who made him the 15th player selected in the 1991 draft. The Washington Redskins and Jets waived him last year. In two seasons, he made seven tackles.   \"I had the opportunity at those other places; they just didn't pan out,\" said Richardson, 25. \"My dad always told me that adversity builds character, so I guess I'm getting a lot of character.\" (AP) Cincinnati Bengals    David Klingler, Cincinnati's starter in his second pro season, says he isn't worried about Jay Schroeder taking his job. Klingler, last year's first-round draft pick, said he welcomes the experience Schroeder and quarterbacks coach Ken Anderson have to offer.   \"If anything, having Jay there takes off the pressure,\" said Klingler, who has played in four N.F.L. games, compared with 100 for Schroeder. \"With Kenny, now you have two guys back there with a lot to offer.\"   Schroeder, once the starter for Washington and the Los Angeles Raiders, played for the 1987 Super Bowl champion Redskins. He came to the Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, signing a two-year contract for up to $3 million, but was told he would be Klingler's backup.   \"In the back of my mind, I'm thinking I could go 16 weeks and not get a shot,\" Schroeder said. \"But I've got to be prepared. That's the only way I can treat it. I've seen it happen for nine years. It's tough to go through a whole season with one quarterback. I don't think they would have brought me in here if they didn't think I could start.\" (AP) San Diego Chargers    Cornerback Gill Byrd, the San Diego Chargers' career interception leader with 31 over 6 years and the current player with the most time as a Charger, underwent reconstructive surgery on his left knee yesterday and is out for the season.   The team physician, Dr. Gary Losse, repaired two ligaments and a tendon that Byrd, 32, tore when he apparently caught his cleats in the grass and fell during a non-contact, one-on-one drill Tuesday afternoon.
