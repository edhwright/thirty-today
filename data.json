Patrons and Projects, 1892-1912 (Yale University, $60). The author, an assistant curator of European painting at the Art Institute of Chicago, examines Vuillard's work during the two decades in which he created decorative panels and screens for some of his affluent patrons. His first efforts, for a Paris industrialist, established many of the themes Vuillard (1868-1940) would explore in his subsequent decorations: domestic scenes on a terrace, vignettes in a dressmaking studio, images of nursemaids with children in public gardens. Ms. Groom stresses that perhaps more than the choice of subject or format, Vuillard's use of distemper -- a technique requiring the fast and arduous application of a mixture of glue and pigment to obtain a tapestrylike surface -- signaled his concern for the decorative qualities of his work and helped to change ideas about interior decoration and modern esthetics. The book is profusely illustrated with color reproductions not only of Vuillard's work but also of paintings by contemporaries like Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Claude Monet. Sure-footed and fluid, Ms. Groom's highly informative study gives Vuillard's sophisticated decorations the recognition they deserve.

A photograph reveals that Kusakabe also had time for football. He died of tuberculosis in 1870 and was posthumously elected to Phi Beta Kappa.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Food at All Hours, and a Sense of Family","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/nyregion/food-at-all-hours-and-a-sense-of-family.html","abstract":"  FORGET about the jug of wine, the loaf of bread and thou.

The plan, which was designed to improve security in the one-square-mile area, was introduced after the explosion of car bombs planted by the Irish Republican Army, including an April 1993 explosion at Bishopsgate. The area encompasses London's financial district, including the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street, which has its own museum, the Guildhall, and the Lloyd's of London building. Tourist attractions such as St. Paul's Cathedral and the Barbican Center are on the edge of the area affected by the plan.    The aim of the program is to reroute through traffic onto the City's main roads, leaving the side streets free for essential local traffic only. The core of the City's street pattern has survived since medieval times and many of the streets are very narrow, winding between historic buildings. The restrictions limit access to this area to eight routes, one of which is for buses and taxis only. Some 20 intersections have been closed. Access points are staffed by the City of London Police.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Playing Ball With the O.S.S.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/books/playing-ball-with-the-oss.html","abstract":"  THE CATCHER WAS A SPY The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg.

This is an enormous understatement.   Glen Canyon was the largest and most spectacular slickrock canyon system on the Colorado Plateau, a deep, remote, enormous expanse of wilderness. Now under a thousand feet of water and mud in its main channel, it has been reduced to a boat pond and motor resort (treated, as the author pointed out, with contempt by resort owners who have been tossing boat batteries in its waters for years). Many of us who know and love the Colorado Plateau's wilderness feel very bitter about the atrocity known as \"Lake Foul,\" and about the damming of a place whose very wildness and remoteness made it politically defenseless back in the early 60's. To extoll the beauties of the cliffs of Lake Powell without considering what lies underneath the waters, the mud and the engine batteres is akin (using a well-worn analogy) to touring a purposely flooded cathedral and admiring the accessibility of its ceilings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"The Nueva Basque Cuisine of San Sebastian","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/travel/choice-tables-the-nueva-basque-cuisine-of-san-sebastian.html","abstract":"  SAN Sebastian is a small, elegant seaside resort that feels frozen in time.

Edited by Nicholas Wade, Cornelia Dean and William A. Dicke. (Times Books/Random House, $25.) Scarcely any discipline makes the concerned lay reader feel more helpless than the environmental sciences. Everything is connected to everything else: air-conditioning in Texas causes skin cancer in Kazakhstan; whatever anybody does makes everything worse. \"The Environment From Your Backyard to the Ocean Floor\" means to help. It is based principally on articles that appeared in The New York Times from 1990 to 1993; its editors say it is intended to provide readers an understanding of environmental issues by focusing \"on the science that provides, or should provide, the framework for political discussion.\" Its 112 articles explore such recent newsworthy subjects as pollution in the former Communist nations, the perils of intelligence to parrots, the dangers of stocking game fish and the contribution of lawn mowers to smog. Threats and disasters occupy most of the book, but interesting sections are devoted to the economic consequences of ecological studies, reassessments of previously identified menaces, and the possible restoration of damaged ecosystems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Capitalist Country Fair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/style/evening-hours-capitalist-country-fair.html","abstract":"  Mixing business with pleasure and charity, Forbes estate, July 16.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"The Heart Of the Zulu Kingdom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/travel/the-heart-of-the-zulu-kingdom.html","abstract":"  THE battlefield of Isandlwana has not changed much since the day in 1879 when the British redcoats suffered one of the most humiliating defeats of their imperial history.

But a drive along 60 -- more specifically the 120-mile section known as the Midland Trail Scenic Highway -- imparts the Mountain State's history and reveals its natural beauty the way I-64 never will.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"From the Ashes of the Blitz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/books/from-the-ashes-of-the-blitz.html","abstract":"  LONDON'S BURNING Life, Death and Art  in the Second World War.

The Karoo, as the great dry prairie plains and huge mountain ranges that cover nearly a third of the country are known, is ready made for tales of hardy pioneers, settlers battling indigenous peoples, and humanity waging a war for survival against nature, for those are the contours of its history.   The residents of the Karoo are survivors in what a character in a play by Athol Fugard, South Africa's enduring dramatic voice, called a \"landscape of extremes\" -- vast spaces devoid of human life, brutal drought-inducing heat in summer, floods, bitter cold and, this year at least, snow in winter. But it is also a landscape of subtlety, of changing shapes and particularly colors, as the mountains act as a canvas for the sun's light, metamorphosing from unearthly purple to cerulean blue to drab brown depending on time of day, distance and season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Trapping Fire I.

The crates, dropped by parachute, missed their target by a mile and crashed onto the foundation of a stone building under construction, a grassy knoll near a United Nations helicopter and a cornfield where goats were grazing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940725","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/25/us/inside-759341.html","abstract":"  Irish Peace Tenets Rejected   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., rejected several crucial points of a peace initiative for Northern Ireland, dealing a setback to efforts to end years of violence.

By chance, someone happened to move their bomb-laden briefcase, and the Fuhrer was only wounded as walls shook in his underground command post in East Prussia. Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, the chief conspirator, had already left the room. On hearing the blast, he mistakenly assumed Hitler was dead and sped to Berlin to spur the revolt, only to be arrested and summarily executed later that day.    The July 20 plot was a noble failure, an honorable treason. Yet in a profound but poignant sense the failure triumphed. Nothing better became the conspirators than their demeanor when they were arrested, tortured, tried before a ranting Nazi judge and then strangled slowly with piano wire -- much of this filmed for Hitler's gratification. Of the nearly 200 principals who were thus executed, none recanted; several thousand other suspects were later convicted in civilian courts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940725","headline":"Elton John and Billy Joel: So Alike, So Different","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/25/arts/pop-review-elton-john-and-billy-joel-so-alike-so-different.html","abstract":"  When Elton John and Billy Joel performed together on Friday night at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., in the first of five sold-out shows ending this Friday, the concert began more like a diplomatic meeting than a pop music performance.

A BATTLE OVER WIND-SHEAR RADAR   Long Island residents, backed by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, have forced the Federal Aviation Administration to abandon the two sites it had chosen for huge radar towers to monitor wind conditions at Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. Now the Senator is sponsoring legislation that would direct the administration to begin testing an alternative system at the airports themselves -- a system that he says is smaller, cheaper and safer.

added to my computer collection for one principal business-related reason: to write on the back porch on hot summer weekends. It is a fine machine in many ways, but the little built-in trackball is awkward to use even when it works correctly, which it often doesn't. Microsoft Windows can be operated without a mouse or trackball, but many of its programs cannot.   While it seems that the rest of the world is switching from DOS computers to Microsoft Windows computers, with DOS in the background, I switched back.

In their overall configuration, our death penalty statutes facially satisfy the constitutional requirements of the Eighth and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The multitiered pyramid meets the prerequisite of consistency and reliability by guiding the capital sentencer's discretion with clear and objective standards that narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty and by providing a meaningful basis for distinguishing between those cases in which the death penalty is imposed and those in which it is not. The third tier in the pyramid meets the individualization prerequisite by requiring the sentencer to consider any relevant mitigating information so as to enable the sentencer to make the reasoned moral judgment that death is the appropriate punishment in a particular case.                      . . .         We must therefore decide whether contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms compel the conclusion that any death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The question is not whether any one of us would vote to enact a death penalty if our role were that of a legislator. It is, rather, whether the defendant is correct in his contention that the death penalty is so inherently cruel and so lacking in moral and sociological justification that it is unconstitutional on its face because it is fundamentally offensive to evolving standards of human decency. Stated so categorically, we are unpersuaded by the defendant's contention. Judicial evaluation of evolving standards of human decency cannot proceed in a vacuum. Community standards of acceptable legislative policy choices are necessarily reflected in the text of our constitutional document, in our history and in the teachings of our sister states as well as that of the Federal courts. While we should not blindly follow a beaten path, we agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court's cogent observation: \"When, in the course of a decade, 37 states call for the death penalty, the probability that the legislature of each state accurately reflects its community's standards approaches certainty.\" State v.
