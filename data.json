ACCURACY On the charge that Mr. McCall has mispresented his position, Mr. London has said that gun laws are too stringent, but he does not advocate eliminating all controls. He has also said that Jews in Brooklyn should arm themselves in self-defense.   On Social Security, the McCall ad says that Mr. London favors scrapping it in favor of private insurance, while Mr. London says that is merely one option to consider.    On abortion, Mr. McCall's ad says Mr. London oposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest. Mr. London's campaign says he has advocated legislation allowing abortions in these cases, although he is personally opposed to it. SCORECARD Given the speed and heat of his response, Mr. London is obviously concerned about the impact of Mr. McCall's original ad. But the response itself appears to be inflammatory and does not clarify who Mr. London is or what he stands for. For example, the headline, \"Kill the Jews,\" is so laden with emotion and lacking explanation that the juxtaposition borders on suggesting that Mr. McCall advocates that position.

It takes some nerve to face off a nerdy paleo anthropologist and a maniacal killer in the same story, but Mr. Gores has the nerve -- and the stylistic verve -- to pull it off. His inventive narrative, which combines elements of cop drama, mob caper and suspense thriller, takes its theme from a mesmerizing lecture on the innate brutality of men and apes, delivered by a scientist whose wife was murdered and who knows too much about mob business for his own good. The tension comes from the efforts of Dante Stagnaro, the head of the San Francisco Police Department's Organized Crime Task Force, to protect the scientist from a brilliant hit man who calls himself Raptor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Princeton Borough Journal;\nLibrary Is Suffering From Lack of Space","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/princeton-borough-journal-library-is-suffering-from-lack-of-space.html","abstract":"AT the Princeton Public Library, 120,000 volumes are jammed onto shelves designed to hold just 80,000.

Though set in London and free of poeticizing, \"Paddywack\" is as Irish as anything by Brian Friel. The scale of the play is small, but it's also as politically committed as Sean O'Casey's early work. By saying that, I don't mean to place Mr. Magee, who comes from the Roman Catholic working class in Belfast, in a league with either Mr. Friel or O'Casey. It's only to emphasize that on the basis of this one play, he seems to be a refreshingly aggressive new Irish voice. No sad songs for him. He speaks tough, efficient prose.   \"Paddywack\" is initially about bigotry, but it's also about politics. At the play's center is Damien, a young Belfast construction worker who says he has come to London looking for work. He's polite and wellspoken, but he's also terribly sure of himself. For a member of the working class, he has a surprisingly large vocabulary, as well as the kind of ferocious wit that withers the opposition in any argument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Budapest's Museums of Everyday Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/travel/budapests-museums-of-everyday-life.html","abstract":"In a small country like Hungary, nothing, it seems, is too trivial to enshrine: Budapest, the capital, is filled with museums of daily life that pay tribute to everything from the telephone to the tram, pastries to pharmaceuticals, ads to animal husbandry.

Across campus, in Sevilla Cottage, Kevin King's room -- decorated with paintings he did, plants and posters of reggae stars -- is equally appealing. \n\nMs. Banks, 17, has been at Leake & Watts for three months; Mr. King, for three years. Although their living quarters are homey, their situations are temporary.\n\nLike the other residents, they needed supervised living because their parents were unable to care for them, or because they were getting into trouble; like the other residents, they will eventually return to family members or get places of their own.\n\nWhile they are at Leake & Watts, residents attend school, get jobs, go out with friends, cook, clean, buy clothes and CD's, rent videos -- all the things people do when they are not living in an institution.\n\n\"We are trying to prepare young people for life,\" said James Campbell, executive director, adding that there are many vocational and counseling programs as well. \"They learn responsibility; they learn how to relate to other people and how to express themselves. A lot of our people go on to be great successes.\"\n\nLeake & Watts, a children's welfare agency, is on 30 acres in a southwest corner of Yonkers on the Riverdale border. It serves 1,000 people ranging from infants to 21 years old. Eight hundred are living in foster homes in Westchester and the Bronx; 100 are in group homes in the Bronx, and 100 live on campus -- in a total of 10 houses that are 1920's Tudor style or 1950's Colonial or 1960's California modern.\n\nIn addition to the houses, which are known as cottages, there is a school building and the 100-year-old administration building, and there are 10 new \"cottages\" on the grounds. \n\nAlthough they are still little more than steel frames, staff and residents are looking forward to their open floor plans, big windows to let in lots of sun and expanded areas for recreation. They will be completed in the summer of 1996 and will house an additional 55 residents.\n\nThe $39 million project, which also includes renovation of existing buildings, is being paid for by the State Dormitory Authority and was designed by the architect Richard Dattner of Manhattan. \n\nIt represents a historic occasion of sorts, said Dennis Castro, associate executive director of Leake & Watts. The Dormitory Authority in the past has granted money for the building of universities and schools, but not living quarters. \"The architects actually stayed in the old buildings, which are also being renovated, to see what was good and what should be changed,\" Mr. Castro said. \"They really lived with our residents.\" \n\nLeake & Watts opened in 1831 in upper Manhattan as the Leake & Watts Orphanage with funds from the estates of John George Leake and Robert Watts. \n\nInitially its residents were all boys, and all, as described in institutional literature, full orphans with both parents dead or missing. By 1851, girls were admitted; in 1888, the institution bought its current property and had the grounds designed by Frederick Law Olmstead. The Gothic-style main building -- now used for administrative offices -- was said to be \"typical of the days when orphans were housed in large dormitories containing rows upon rows of little cots.\" \n\nIn the early years, a child would usually stay until he was 21, at which point he would go into an indenturing program with farmers upstate. (The average stay is now two years.) \n\nBy 1908, Leake & Watts was admitting half orphans -- children whose homes had broken up because of poverty. The next two decades saw major changes, with the addition of a school, replacement of the dormitory with the cottage system and the diversification of the population. From the 1930's to today, the institution has expanded in size and scope and now offers a variety of services to a varied clientele. \n\nThe image of an orphan, for example, is no longer that of a freckle-faced, parentless boy who gets in trouble for stealing a hot mickey (potato) from someone else's trash-bin fire. \n\nThese days, a typical Leake & Watts resident is likely to have a living mother and father, but the parents may be overwhelmed by problems associated with poverty -- drug use, AIDS, involvement in crime.\n\nIn other cases, it is not the parents or lack of them but the youngster who requires placement: truancy, rocky relationships at home and with peers or, as one resident put it, \"too much hanging out on the street\" can result in a court-ordered placement.\n\n\"Poverty causes problems,\" said Phyllis Gurdin, assistant executive director in charge of resident programs. \"Desertion comes with poverty -- the father leaves, the family breaks up.\" \n\nA graph of admissions over the years, she added, shows correlation between peak population at the home and societal upheavals: the 1848 potato famine, the Civil War in 1860, the huge waves of immigrants in the early 1900's, and so on, through the Depression, World War II and the prevalence of crack cocaine, heroin and AIDS in the 1990's.\n\nOver the years, too, the racial and ethnic mix at Leake & Watts has changed from primarily Italian and Irish in the founding years to the current population, which is 90 percent black and Hispanic. \n\nSocial theory and statistics, however, mean little to the Leake & Watts residents who are concentrating on making lives for themselves.\n\nDatayna Jordan has been there for five years, since she was 12. A soft-spoken girl with big expressive eyes, she is one of nine children. She is at Leake & Watts, she said, because \"something bad happened to my mom, not because I was acting up in school or anything.\" Now, she added, her mother is \"getting her life back together\" and so is she.\n\n\"You get opportunities here you don't find elsewhere,\" she said. \"Last summer, I got to go to F.I.T. -- I might like to go into fashion, or maybe do hair for a living.\"\n\nMs. Banks, who would like a career in journalism, is working as a secretary for one of Leake & Watts's off-campus programs. She became a resident \"because I was having a little communication problem with my mother.\" She said she found the change difficult at first:\n\n\"When you live in a house with one parent, one sister and one brother, it's hard to come into a setting where you are living with eight girls and have to share things and make compromises.\" Now, though, things are looking up: \"I like having a job, and I like learning about responsibility.\" \n\nMr. King credits some of his biggest personal successes to the Leake & Watts staff. \"Brian and Vladimir made me who I am today,\" he said, referring to Brian Lyons, a child-care worker, and Vladimir Carvajal, assistant director of residential programs. \n\nThe two encouraged his artistic abilities -- in his room are a beach scene and a seascape he painted -- and helped him understand not only his talents but also his own temperament. \n\n\"Before I came here, I was running around with a gang,\" he said. \"We weren't real bad or anything, but if someone messed with one of us, we'd beat them up. Like I said, I always kept my hands clean, I never got involved with any real bad stuff. But I needed to be away from that scene, I needed something else.\n\n\"Vladimir and Brian coaxed me to do the best I could do. They taught me to deal with people and to deal with my anger. Now I get along very well with everyone here.\n\n\"I don't think of myself as a leader, but people tell me I am.

Rowland PRODUCER: Greg Stevens & Company, Alexandria, Va. SCRIPT: Mr. Rowland: \"I don't blame you for being disgusted with politics. I'm pretty disgusted too. As you know, The Hartford Courant and some of my political enemies will do anything to stop us. They want you to believe that something awful occurred between my former wife and me. But that's not true. We've had our problems, but they don't belong in a political campaign. Protecting my children from this media madness is more important to me than this election. All I ask is that you look beyond the desperate politics and join us for a real change in Connecticut.\" VISUAL: John Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor and a former Congressman, speaks directly to the camera, in front of a gray backdrop. The words, \"John Rowland for Governor,\" appear at the bottom of the screen at the beginning and end of the ad. ACCURACY: Mr. Rowland was divorced earlier this year, and it is true that for the several months The Hartford Courant has tried to obtain documents regarding a police visit to the house of Mr. Rowland's former wife, Deborah, in response to an argument between the two of them. The Middlebury Police have released a brief summary of the incident, describing it as a \"nonviolent\" family dispute, but the town and both Rowlands have opposed providing any additional documents. The Hartford Courant is challenging this position before the state's Freedom of Information Commission.   The newspaper's stories about the incident have not been featured prominently and have never speculated about or hinted at what may have occurred. Its coverage has focused on the legal wrangling over whether the documents should be available to the public. Similar stories have appeared in other newspapers and on television and radio news programs. None of Mr. Rowland's gubernatorial opponents have referred to the stories; it is unclear to whom he is referring when he mentions \"political enemies.\" SCORECARD: Mr. Rowland has been the front-runner in the race since January, but in recent weeks his lead has narrowed, and he appears to be losing support among Republican women. This commercial is a bold attempt by Mr. Rowland to defuse a growing problem. Attacking the media has sometimes worked well for candidates; the risk is that the commercial will add fuel to the fire, sustaining the controversy and making more people aware of it.

DelBello, is vying with the Republican nominee, Vincent L. Leibell 3d, for the seat abandoned by George E. Pataki in his pursuit of the statehouse.   The lack of choice offered the vast majority of voters this year is seen by some as a reflection of a campaign finance system that gives an overwhelming advantage to incumbent legislators and discourages challengers.

In a role that she acknowledges \"Barbara Stanwyck would have gotten if she were alive,\" the petite and very slender Ms. Fiorentino plays Bridget, a sleek seductress who, like the femmes fatales of Stanwyck's day, will stop at nothing to get her way.

There, for eight summers, Anton Seidl conducted members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in concerts that drew workers and children, wealthy sponsors and Coney Island tourists, with the promise of compositions by Beethoven, Liszt, Grieg, Mendelssohn, Dvorak and, most often, Wagner. Attendance records were broken not by barbershop quartets but by concerts featuring works like Walther's Prize Song from \"Die Meistersinger.\"   \"All the social and intellectual factors of Brooklyn life are present,\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote of Seidl's concerts, \"and the crowd there is unlike any gathered anywhere outside of Bayreuth.\" According to The Musical Courier, the audiences were quieter than those in Manhattan concert halls; during the concerts the nearby Coney Island beaches were deserted. The concerts were sponsored by the Seidl Society, an organization of women who adored Wagner and were transported by the abilities of the conductor, who had studied with the master. The concert program showed a woman gazing into space, hearing, no doubt, strains of Wagner to the accompaniment of breakers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Whither the Universe?

This is not just because it includes his recent big, festive gouaches of multicolored ribbons, which are more sumptuous and full-blooded than anything he has done before. It's also because some of his best early works on paper are playful in ways you wouldn't expect from having seen his sculptures and even many of his murals, or wall drawings, as he calls them.    Sculpture and drawing are different mediums, of course. Drawings tend to be intimate.

Kevin Triplett, a Nascar spokesman, said last week that the organization was considering four rule changes for the 1995 season to offset the increase in speeds that have occurred at most Winston Cup tracks this year, mostly as a result of the raging tire battle between Goodyear and Hoosier, a racing-tire company in Indiana.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"K.

Stein's carefully researched exhibition catalogue takes a judicious approach to providing an answer for the work of Horace Pippin (1888-1946). A self-taught painter and resident of West Chester, Pa., Pippin came to prominence in the late 1930's and 40's through the efforts of a number of white critics, curators and patrons, including the Philadelphia collector Albert C. Barnes. In his catalogue essay for Pippin's first solo show in 1940, Barnes called Pippin \"the first important Negro painter to appear on the American scene.\" Included in the \"Masters of Popular Painting\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1938, Pippin became a key figure at the intersection of two important trends in the history of modern art in the United States: scene painting and primitivism. Pippin's bold, simplified domestic scenes, landscapes, portraits and history paintings synthesized the two, making his work highly marketable to an audience eager to prove its own sophistication through its very modern appreciation of so-called primitive art. A particular strength of \"I Tell My Heart\" is its attention to the relations between Pippin and the nexus of dealers, patrons, critics and curators who promoted and collected his work. For as Judith Wilson, who teaches art history at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, points out in another essay, Pippin's example \"refutes a stereotype -- that of the self-taught artist as a socio-cultural isolate.\" Ms. Stein, an adjunct curator at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, has assembled a catalogue that offers great insight not only into Pippin's work, but also into the American art world of the 1930's and 40's.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"The New Fit And Flare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/style/on-the-street-the-new-fit-and-flare.html","abstract":"  Two major fashion trends were seen in the audience at the spring fashion collections in Paris last week: the knee-length hemline and the revival of the feminine princess line.

Not long ago, Mr. Curtis, the British producer of made-for-television films like the 1993 production of \"Suddenly Last Summer\" and the 1992 \"Tales From Hollywood\" shown here on PBS, discovered what Americans have long called the golden age of television. He was a little taken aback that it had slightly predated the era of Britain's \"angry young men\" playwrights, which began with John Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\" (1956). But when Mr. Curtis learned that no kinescopes existed of many of the 1950's American television plays, he decided to remake them.   \"Marty,\" Paddy Chayefsky's story of a lonely young butcher who falls in love, was his first choice, but he soon learned that getting remake rights for that film would be very complicated. So Mr. Curtis started looking at the nine other plays Chayefsky had written for NBC's \"Philco TV Playhouse,\" and he found \"The Mother.\" Tomorrow night at 9, a new production, starring Anne Bancroft and Joan Cusack in roles originated by Cathleen Nesbitt and Maureen Stapleton in 1954, will be shown on PBS's Great Performances series.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Costume Maker's Prepared for Any Need","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/costume-maker-s-prepared-for-any-need.html","abstract":"  THERE are sure to be at least six Elvis sightings in northern New Jersey this Halloween and reports of close encounters with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers will be almost countless, according to the management of a costume maker here called A Costume Factory.    \"Power Rangers are the biggest thing for the kids this Halloween,\" said R.

There are, after all, some 6,340 square meters of them: hundreds of thousands of glass tesserae, the elements of mosaics, that cover the walls; multicolored figures from the Old and New Testaments that flutter against a golden background in a circular dance culminating in the great Christ Pantocrator who rises, 60 feet tall, above the altar. This church, founded by the Norman King William II in 1175, we now recognize to be unique in Western art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"HOME CLINIC;\nTake Action Against Mice Before They Multiply Out of Hand","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/home-clinic-take-action-against-mice-before-they-multiply-out-of.html","abstract":"MOST people do not worry about mice until they see one scurrying across their floor.
