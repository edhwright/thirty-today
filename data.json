This is a group that will watch in humble silence as once-proud white collar employees are downsized out of their comfortable offices and into hamburger uniforms, as manufacturing jobs are rounded up and shipped overseas to semi-slaves working in squalid conditions, as massive amounts of research and development money flow into monumentally wasteful military projects at the expense of product development and technical innovation in private industry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"Sports of The Times; '94 Season: May It Rest In Disarray","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/sports/sports-of-the-times-94-season-may-it-rest-in-disarray.html","abstract":"  THE 1994 baseball season is all but hooked up to a suicide machine. Any moment now, Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner, will put the game out of the protracted misery caused by a strike and the intransigence of both owners and players.   When, not if, Selig acts, the focus will switch from New York and Milwaukee -- the power bases of the union and of Selig, who also owns the Brewers -- to Washington, the power base of the only government officials that could do something about this travesty.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"Still a Chance on Health Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/opinion/still-a-chance-on-health-care.html","abstract":"  When Congress left town last month, the health care debate simmered down. But the staffs of the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and the bipartisan Mainstream Coalition continued to talk and have reportedly reached substantial agreement. Though the emerging bill would be incremental -- leaving some individuals uninsured -- it would improve health care for most Americans. Incremental reform would be substantial reform.   Why, then, does passage seem so distant? Standing in the way are political calculations by Robert Dole, the minority leader of the Senate, and Richard Gephardt, the majority leader of the House. They have yet to decide whether to go for limited reform this year or use defeat as an election-year strategy. Health care security for millions hangs in the balance because no one expects Congress to rebound from total defeat this year to pass reform next year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/nyregion/metro-digest-233188.html","abstract":"  THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: TO THE VICTORS, ANOTHER RUN   State Senator George E.

Previous conferences in this once-a-decade event have favored other solutions, such as economic growth (\"development is the best contraceptive\") or the provision of family planning services. Each approach can claim successes, and the world has made great progress in reducing the rate of growth in recent decades.

He crashed into and damaged American faith in the protective capabilities of technology and security forces.   Radar and heat-seeking missiles are useful tools. The Secret Service, like any human organization, has its strengths, most of which derive from the selfless bravery of members who really are willing to die in the line of duty. But no technical wizardry and courage can forever disguise one of the grimmest facts of modern history. Even the most advanced society is never far above what William Butler Yeats called the \"bestial floor\" of human disorder, and the nets constructed above that floor are weaker than most dare to imagine. - Perhaps the military triumphs of the early 20th century gave Americans an exaggerated confidence in protective machines and bureaucracies. Even in Washington, where fallibility is ever on parade, officials and journalists share that faith. In the early 80's, a high fence was erected between the Treasury building and the White House, and behind that fence a mighty excavation went on for months. The grapevine buzzed with talk that some advanced and highly competent security work was being installed to protect the Executive Mansion from terrorist tricks.   Newspapers and broadcasters, out of a well-placed sense of responsibility, have never reported in much detail about what is lodged in the bunkers and on the rooftops around Pennsylvania Avenue. There was a widespread impression -- a faith, if you will -- that these locations housed devices of great potency for diverting or exploding incoming threats from land or air.   Mr. Corder's mad and silent glide into the Andrew Jackson magnolia has rent a hole in that faith. The White House may well be protected by radars capable of detecting an intruder violating its airspace and by artillery and missiles capable of downing aircraft. But response time is limited and firing off weapons in Washington's crowded streets or air corridors is risky to the lives of many.   What is supposed to protect the White House is, of course, a notion much more valuable and, if it can be sustained, much more powerful than weaponry and sharpshooters. It is the idea that Americans want and deserve to be governed by a person living in a house on a street close to comings and goings of citizens. The value of that idea is apparent to anyone who has experienced the vast isolation and remoteness of executive or imperial residences in other great capitals.   Drunken and drugged, Mr. Corder wanted his moment of notoriety and probably wished to be depicted as a crazed but not particularly malicious daredevil. But if he succeeds in turning Washington into a bunkered city, he must go down on a list of archcriminals who with bullets and now with an airplane have assaulted a noble, old and battered idea about how Presidents ought to live.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"In House Races, Incumbents Defeat Challengers Handily","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/nyregion/the-1994-campaign-congress-in-house-races-incumbents-defeat-challengers-handily-233528.html","abstract":"  Hamilton Fish Jr.  19th District, Democrat    Hamilton Fish Jr. was elected last night by Democrats in the 19th Congressional District in the lower Hudson River Valley as their nominee to replace his Republican father, Representative Hamilton Fish.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940914","headline":"Officer Wounded in Subway Said to Describe 4 Shots in Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/nyregion/officer-wounded-in-subway-said-to-describe-4-shots-in-back.html","abstract":"  The transit police officer badly wounded by an off-duty New York City police officer in a subway shootout last month has told prosecutors that he remembers being shot four times in the back, twice after he had fallen and was prone on the ground, according to law-enforcement officials working on the investigation.

Which is not to say that the conception is bland; Paul Shortt's sets, with their sun-worn Mediterranean colors and rugged surfaces, shroud the action in palpable atmosphere. This \"Carmen\" has an exact comprehension of time and place.   But there's little in the production that calls attention to itself or strives for whimsy. The village square in Act I is set off by stark columns and overhung with light-filtering blinds.  The mountain pass in Act III, Scene 1 is given focus by the ominous form of a ruined church. The final scene has a splendid sense of depth, and the imposing gate to the bull ring strongly suggests the festive space offstage so important to the conclusion's multi-layered effect.

But when the notice of her swearing-in ceremony arrived, her heart sank. The ceremony had already taken place.   The baby sitter missed a second and then a third swearing-in because subsequent notices from the Immigration and Naturalization Service also arrived too late. So, anxious and confused, she turned last spring for help to her boss, who happened to be the Deputy Attorney General.   Ms. Gorelick oversees the immigration agency, but she said she had called the I.N.S. \"just as myself.\" Transferred from number to number, she lingered on hold \"for what seemed like forever,\" she said, until she was finally disconnected. She tried again and reached an answering machine. She left her name, home phone number and a request for assistance.   But the immigration service never returned the Deputy Attorney General's call.   With that brief encounter, Ms. Gorelick got a taste of how the I.N.S. often treats its principal clients, for illegal immigrants, criminal aliens and corrupt brokers do not consume the bulk of its time. Rather, the agency expends most of its effort serving more than four million people from around the world who each year make simple and perfectly legal requests for benefits, from working papers to citizenship.   Every one of these clients pays a fee, generating $576 million this year, or a third of the agency's budget. Yet immigration officials acknowledge that the agency often fails to provide them with humane, efficient service, leaving people like Ms. Gorelick's baby sitter (who eventually was sworn in) unnecessarily anguished.   \"We're a monopoly, yet we make people suffer,\" said Phil Waters, the acting director of the agency's San Francisco office. \"It's crazy. People are paying good money to get service from the Government, and we're not giving it.\"   Every day, across the country, immigrants' phone calls go unanswered and their letters sit unopened. Their files get lost, and their cases get improperly entered in antiquated databases. And often, because they get only a busy signal or a recording by phone, immigrants stand for hours, sometimes even overnight, in lines that snake through office buildings and parking lots.   In an interview, Attorney General Janet Reno said she had not quite believed a friend in Miami who told her that it was impossible to reach the agency by phone. So she tried calling the Miami number herself -- and could not get through.   With 19,000 employees and 65 nearly autonomous offices around the world, the immigration service is not a monolith. Every day, some immigration officers rise above their daily tribulations and hobbling constraints to offer compassionate, intelligent service. And any agency that serves almost five million clients a year is going to offend some of them and make mistakes with others.   But the I.N.S. mishandles far more cases than its share because the agency is organized in a way that allows some barely trained employees to bark at the clients, turn a deaf ear to their complaints or mishandle their requests.   \"A lot of people have gone out of their way to make this a cold, rude, insensitive and inefficient agency,\" said A. D. Moyer, director of the immigration district in Chicago.   The I.N.S. is charged with two missions that many people inside and outside the agency find to be in conflict. On the one hand, the agency polices the borders and airports, arrests criminals and expels illegal immigrants. On the other, it provides services to an overwhelming majority who travel or already live here legally.   Of these two sides of the agency's personality, law enforcement has always dominated. In fact, making arrests at the border has always been the road to advancement. As a result, many legal aliens have long complained that some immigration agents treat them like criminal suspects. This attitude, coupled with the inefficiency that riddles the agency, often causes headaches and worse.   \"The I.N.S. is completely like a Soviet bureaucracy,\" said Leonid Zagalsky, 39, a Russian immigrant in New York. \"Every sign starts with the word 'no': No smoking. No standing. No sitting. No asking questions. You cannot reach a human being by phone. And when you go, you stand for many humiliating hours in line only to reach a semi-human who answers your measly question by talking in a cabalistic language: 'I-95, dash, point 6, dash, B-52.' \" (Mr. Zagalsky was referring to the agency's complex numbered forms.)   Many of the agency's own employees, interviewed in roundtable discussions at district offices across the country, openly ridiculed some of the agency's efforts to serve its clients. And almost without exception, the employees said nothing had improved for them since Bill Clinton took office -- in client service or any of the agency's other fields of responsibility.   \"There've been changes, but it's not really better,\" Mr. Waters said. \"We're falling even farther behind.\"   But the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, Doris M. Meissner, said that she and others were struggling to improve. They are trying, for example, to promote the idea that immigrants should be treated with \"humanity and respect,\" as Ms. Gorelick said. Ms. Meissner has directed officials to stop calling immigrants \"aliens\" and to practice \"enforcement with a heart.\"   T. Alexander Aleinikoff, who became the agency's general counsel in March, said, \"I go around telling people: 'This is not the Deportation and Detention Service. This is the Immigration and Naturalization Service.' \"   But as with all the agency's problems, the leaders are dealing with an internal culture that may be difficult to change.   One senior official at headquarters, for instance, rolled his eyes at the idea that \"illegal alien\" was no longer an acceptable term. He asked, \"What are we supposed to call them, 'out-of-status visitors' ?\" The System 10 Years In the Wrong Line     On their first days on the job, immigration employees learn that efficiency is usually the goal, not the reality. They confront mountains of paper files, and they inherit backlog upon backlog. In the meager training courses that only some of them attend, many only skim the surface of the very complicated laws they will administer. And they are taught to be vigilant about the deceitful practices of immigrants.   Overworked and guarded, they can make mistakes. And when they do, it can take months to correct them, if not years. Michael and Corazon Graves of Newark, Calif., believe they are paying a high price for what they see as the agency's willful refusal to correct its own error. In essence, an immigration official mistakenly told them to wait in the wrong line, and that line was 10 years long.   On May 13, 1982, an immigration examiner in San Francisco approved Mr. Graves's petition to sponsor his stepdaughter, a Filipino, for an immigrant visa. With that, he placed the stepdaughter, Maria Isabel Cruz, at the end of a long waiting list for prospective Filipino immigrants.   In 1992, the year Ms. Cruz and her three sons were finally due to arrive, Mr. and Mrs. Graves completed an addition to their home for them. Half a world away, Ms. Cruz thought her final interview, with United States consular officials in Manila, would be little more than a formality.   She was wrong. She emerged from the interview in tears, her mother said. The consular officials denied her a visa because the I.N.S. had made a mistake in approving the original petition. A stepfather, it turned out, cannot sponsor a stepchild who was married before the age of 18, as Ms. Cruz was. The Graves were unaware of this fine point of immigration law, and the examiner who approved their petition had either failed to read it thoroughly or had not known this herself.   The Graves should have been advised in 1982 that only Mrs. Graves, who is 50, had the right to sponsor her child. But they were not, and so they were told 10 years later to start from the beginning, returning to the bottom of another decadelong waiting list.   \"We were in a state of shock,\" said Mr. Graves, a carpenter.   He hired a lawyer, who requested humanitarian parole for Ms. Cruz. That would have allowed her to enter the country and wait here for her visa. The parole was denied, in a letter from the district director in Thailand, who acknowledged that \"the facts presented are certainly unfortunate.\"   Crying, Mrs. Graves said, \"Sometimes I wonder, 'Will I still be alive by the time my daughter gets her papers?' \" Record Keeping Filed Away In a Hodgepodge     The I.N.S. lost Jusuf Becovic's file in 1992 but refused to acknowledge it for almost two years. Every few weeks, Mr. Becovic's lawyer, Diane George, would call about the file, and an agency employee would say they were still searching for it. Finally, Mr. Becovic, a building superintendent in Manhattan, sued the agency.   After 10 months of litigation in Federal court and the intercession of two Congressional offices, the agency created a new file for Mr. Becovic, a Montenegro-born immigrant, and his wife, Hatidza. With that, he and his wife were finally able to renew their work authorization.   \"For two years, I had to keep it secret from my company\" that his work card had expired, Mr. Becovic said. \"I would be fired.\"   Problems like this have their roots in a record-keeping system that combines 44 million paper files with a hodgepodge of more than a half-dozen outdated computer systems that cannot talk to each other.   Despite almost 20 years of consultants' studies, promises and plans, the I.N.S. still does not have a unified computer record-keeping system. It maintains only one very basic central index system, and even that is incomplete.   Over the last two decades, different branches of the agency have cobbled together their own computer networks, as have a few of the 33 district offices. But none of these networks can communicate with the others. So an agency worker checking an immigrant's record in one system has no way to know whether there are other records in another system -- showing, for instance, that an applicant for residency has a criminal history.   \"If we had automation, we would double or triple our work,\" said Robert Reed, a supervisory special agent in Los Angeles. In his office, agents still use manual typewriters and carbon paper.   The automation problem slows nearly every service the agency tries to offer. Officials across the country say they waste hours hunting through paper files and the various computer systems to settle immigrants' cases. That in turn lengthens the endemic backlogs -- like the 480 days it takes to become a citizen in San Francisco, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Ordinarily, it should not take more than a few months.   The agency's central index system in particular contains much information that is incorrect or incomplete.   Last year, California and several other states asked the I.N.S. to review the files of 3.6 million immigrants applying for welfare and other benefits. It turned out that about 18 percent of these people, or 650,000, were not even listed in the central index, an omission that should have meant that they were in this country illegally. Before denying them benefits, however, the states pushed for more information, and found out that nearly all were here legally.   Ms. Meissner acknowledges the computer problem and says she has persuaded the Clinton Administration to remedy it. On Aug. 30, the agency signed a $300 million contract for new computer equipment, the largest such contract in the agency's history. By 1996, the immigration service hopes to merge all its data into three integrated computer systems.   But this is not the first time the agency has tried to solve the problem, nor the first contract it has signed for new computer equipment. Longtime I.N.S. employees wonder whether these plans will turn out any better than the agency's many failed efforts of the past. Attitudes  Unpleasantness As the Norm     Immigration officers learn to be hard-nosed in their first days at the agency's academy in Glynco, Ga.   During basic training, \"we historically have told our employees that it's our job to keep them out and our job to keep them from getting benefits,\" said Tom Farris, an assistant district director in Chicago.   The training inculcates an intrinsic suspicion of immigrants, some I.N.S. officers say. This often translates into rudeness and even vindictiveness, Mr. Farris acknowledged. It can create an atmosphere in some immigration offices that Maria Valencia, a Filipino immigrant in Virginia, described as a \"sea of unpleasantness.\"   While not totally out of place for law-enforcement officers on the border, this attitude creates problems when displayed by examiners reviewing routine applications. It has prompted many critics of the agency and even friends of it to suggest that it should be split in two -- a service side and a law-enforcement division. But Ms. Meissner says she believes that the agency's \"cultural cleavage\" can be bridged.   Some local offices are already trying to do that. The agency's 33 district directors run fiefs. They make their own rules, often quite different from one place to the next, and set the tone. In Chicago, Mr. Moyer is the host of a weekly television show in Spanish about immigrants' rights. He says he has found it trying, but possible, to buck the entrenched mentality.   \"When I first got here to Chicago, we had agents who would brag about their weekend raids on Spanish-language movie theaters, and how all the Mexicans would be jumping out of the balconies,\" Mr. Moyer said. \"I have worked hard to try to correct that. We do no more neighborhood raids. Our enforcement is as strong as exists, but we go about it differently.\"   In Baltimore, the district managers say they demand that immigrants be treated with respect. So it was no coincidence that Wiltrude Rasmussen, a Baltimore deportation officer, took a closer look at the seemingly straightforward deportation case of Adilio Diaz.   A 25-year-old Salvadoran, Mr. Diaz applied for political asylum in 1987. He settled in Maryland and hired a lawyer, Guillermo Diaz-Fontana, who kept assuring him that his case was going well.   Nothing could have been further from the truth. His lawyer, who later pleaded guilty to Federal fraud charges, had already lost the asylum case, and Mr. Diaz had already been ordered deported. He just didn't know it. So one day in December 1990, Mr. Diaz, who said he had paid his lawyer about $1,250, arrived at the Baltimore I.N.S. office, hoping to be told he could have a green card. He left in handcuffs.   When Mr. Diaz's new lawyer, Alison Brown, of the Washington firm of Maggio & Kattar, filed a motion to reopen the case, the I.N.S. did not oppose it; the deportation officer, Mrs. Rasmussen, said she was already suspicious of the first lawyer. The judge reopened Mr. Diaz's case, and, at 6 P.M. on Dec. 22, Mr. Diaz was released from a prison in rural Maryland, 120 miles from his home. He had no money because the Government had issued him a check for his cash -- only about $6, in any case -- and the banks were closed.   Officially, the agency had no further responsibility for Mr. Diaz. But David Talley, supervisor of the detention unit, said: \"I couldn't put him out on the street that way. It just seemed cruel.\"   So Mr. Talley drove Mr. Diaz home, a five-hour round trip, just in time for Christmas with his family.   Mr. Diaz still lives in suburban Washington and works at a skilled job as a rug repairman. His lawyer, Ms. Brown, said the case offered an important lesson.   \"It goes to show,\" she said, \"that you can be a human being, that you can handle enforcement of the immigration laws without an attitude that every alien must be thrown out.\" Chaos at the Gates    SUNDAY: Immigration agency is mismanaged; its ranks, demoralized.

Splitting Canada in two would be wrong, but the vote count suggests Quebecers are not ready to do it. For the U.S., and for continental stability, it is a reassuring indication that our northern neighbor -- closest ally, biggest trading partner and best friend -- will continue to be all of those things.   The victory of the separatist Parti Quebecois was expected. The party will have a solid majority in the provincial parliament, but pre-election polls predicted it would be significantly larger. Moreover, the separatists' failure to win 50 percent of the popular vote, and their slim margin over the Liberal candidates -- less than one-half of 1 percent -- say voters are less than enthusiastic about their new government's aim to create a sovereign nation. Indeed, the Liberals' defeat had more to do with high unemployment and low regard for the party after nine years in office.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940915","headline":"Race for Governor: Pataki Lists His Differences","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/15/nyregion/1994-campaign-ad-campaigns-race-for-governor-pataki-lists-his-differences.html","abstract":"  CANDIDATE -- George E.

Their concerns were expressed during hearings on a bill sponsored by Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens that would require Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get explicit authorization for his plan to place the housing police and transit police under the jurisdiction of Police Commissioner William J. Bratton.   Although Mr. Giuliani signed an executive order last week to carry out the merger of the housing police and the Police Department on Oct. 1, Council members said they could still act before that date. Mr. Giuliani plans to merge the transit police into the larger force in January.   Still it remains unclear whether the Council could indeed block the merger, which some members fear would compromise police protection in housing projects and in the subways.    Mr. McCaffrey suggested that if the Council approves his legislation and the Mayor presses ahead with the merger, a court might have to decide who prevails.   At the hearing, Commissioner Bratton sought to assure the Council that the merger would create sweeping efficiencies in personnel and expenses.   \"I am here to win your confidence and even your support for an action which is the only way to dissolve the climate of fear that has seized many housing developments,\" Mr. Bratton said. \"We can no longer afford to have three police departments with three detective bureaus tracking one individual who happens to commit a robbery on the subway, a mugging on the street and an assault in a housing development.\"    He said that the merger would lead to the immediate placement of an additional 140 officers on patrol in the city's housing projects, since they would be freed from administrative duties that would be assumed by the enlarged Police Department.    But in his testimony before the Public Safety and Government Operations Committees of the Council, Commissioner Bratton seemed to have forged little success in assuring Council members.   \"I don't think the administration has made much of a case for the merger so far,\" said C. Virginia Fields, a Councilwoman who represents Harlem and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. \"They are involved in a public relations effort to sell a plan for which they have not taken the time to answer questions on impact, cost savings or residents' concerns about the possibility of a decline in service. Until they answer those questions, no merger should be implemented.\"   After the hearing, Mr. McCaffrey said the Giuliani administration would meet with several Council leaders in the next few days to address the concerns about the merger. Mr. Giuliani met with several leaders on Tuesday to deal with their questions.   Even so, Mr. McCaffrey said he would continue to press for passage of the bill by two committees on Monday and by the full Council within 10 days after that.    The committees had considered voting on the measure yesterday, but decided, on the urging of the Giuliani administration, to wait. The administration contended that it wanted to answer Council members' questions and to assure them that residents of housing projects would not be adversely affected.   But administration officials also criticized the Council leaders, saying that the lawmakers had, in essence, agreed to a merger in June by passing a budget that made funds available for a combination of the police forces.    They also charged that by waiting to hold the first public hearing just two weeks before the first part of the merger was scheduled, Council leaders were seeking to score political points with their constituents, rather than earnestly seeking to resolve differences over the merger.   The hearing was attended by about 200 spectators, many of them residents of housing projects and many of them constituents of the committee members.   Indeed, rather than asking questions of Commissioner Bratton or other witnesses who testified, several Council members offered lengthy statements chronicling their concerns and opposition to a merger of the housing police with the larger force. In each case, the speeches were met with thunderous applause.   No matter what happens with the McCaffrey bill, the Giuliani administration still needs the formal support of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which provides about $75 million a year, a third of the budget for the housing force. Mr. Giuliani said he has negotiated the details of the merger with the housing department.   But Michael A. Siegel, a spokesman for the Housing Secretary, Henry G. Cisneros, said that before a merger with the housing police could be made final, a public hearing must be held on the merger.    \"The department feels that a merger can only occur if the end result is maintenance or an enhancement of security and police services for the residents of the New York City Housing Authority.\"   A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Monday in Harlem by Representative Floyd H. Flake, the Queens Democrat, the Mayor's office said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940915","headline":"State Voting In Germany Reveals Shift","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/15/world/state-voting-in-germany-reveals-shift.html","abstract":"  Results of two state elections held on Sunday have lent support to the view that the German political landscape is entering a period of fundamental change after decades of stability dictated by the need for national unity during the cold war.

Sept. 21, 1987: Arbitrator Thomas Roberts rules in the first of three collusion grievances, finding that clubs violated the collective bargaining agreement by conspiring not to sign free agents following the 1985 season.

Mingling love and work, it begins with a creative crisis for Frenzy (Katja Riemann), a cartoonist who is short on material for her popular character, a foxy little feminine insect.   \"You try coming up with funny things from your everyday life,\" she complains. So for inspiration, she borrows the exploits of Maischa (Nina Kronjager), her best friend, who is a flirty nurse. Maischa is the foxier and more predatory of the two, but Frenzy turns out to be the one who finds romantic adventure.   The plot is slender, consisting of little more than Maischa's efforts to land a handsome stranger while foisting one of his friends upon a reluctant Frenzy. But onto this sketchy structure, Ms. von Garnier loads plenty of rueful observations about the dating game. Even though Maischa's boy-crazy outlook, plus some emphasis on cold cream and eyelash curlers, threatens to make the film feel retrograde, the director's attitudes remain enjoyably fresh. Her outlook is also sharply feminine, as when it comes to depicting miserable sex or the maneuvers that go with waiting for the phone to ring.   In a film that runs just under an hour, Ms. von Garnier shows a sure command of her subject matter and a bright comic style. Her film has commercial polish, and it also has two likable performances from its stars. Ms. Kronjager is a particularly promising comic actress, with a game, savvy manner that makes her no man's plaything. Her character's tireless self-involvement is also amusing, as when she studies her handsome dinner companion and muses (in voice-over): \"Those eyelashes! Two tons of mascara and I can't get mine to look like that.\"   As the story progresses, it yields a little surprise as Frenzy, not Maischa, winds up lovelorn. And Maischa tries to reassure her. \"Think of all the work you got done,\" Maischa says. \"Feeling bad must be good for you.\"   \"You're saying men who aren't around make you creative?\" Frenzy asks. Not even Maischa is saying that, but \"Making Up!\" does have some legitimate wisdom to pass along.   On the same bill is \"The Coriolis Effect,\" a 25-minute short about two male friends, which was previously reviewed as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series. At that time, Caryn James, writing in The New York Times, called it \"a fresh, self-assured film about sexual jealousy, dangerous living and the afterlife, with a nod to 'The Wizard of Oz.' \" MAKING UP!   Directed and edited by Katja von Garnier; written by Ms. von Garnier, Benjamin Taylor and Hannes Jaenicke; director of photography, Torsten Breuer; music by Peter Wenke and Tillmann Hohn; production design, Irene Edenhofer and Nikolai Ritter; produced by Ewa Karlstrom; released by Seventh Art Releasing. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not rated.

Jean Renoir\" is a glorious retrospective of Renoir's work that begins today and runs for five weeks at Film Forum. All his masterpieces are there: \"The Rules of the Game,\" \"The Golden Coach\" and \"Grand Illusion,\" which opens the series. \"Grand Illusion\" is the ultimate and most humane among prisoner-of-war movies, with Jean Gabin as the French prisoner in a World War I camp run by Erich von Stroheim. These films carry the thrill of discovery for anyone catching them for the first time; from then on, they can never be seen too often.   But perhaps even more tantalizing are the lesser-known, equally rich films in this series, which celebrates the 100th year of Renoir's birth. Among the best early films is \"La Chienne\" (\"The Bitch\"), a 1931 work that Fritz Lang remade in Hollywood as \"Scarlet Street.\" Michel Simon, best known as the hero of Renoir's \"Boudu Saved From Drowning,\" is a sometime painter (later the Edward G.

It was the most devastating toll for any U.S. carrier in seven years, and its cause is still a mystery. The chief of the Federal investigators on the scene offers the most sensible comment so far: Don't jump to conclusions about what went wrong.   It was U.S. Air's fifth fatal crash in as many years -- none similar to the others -- and its second in just three months. Given the airline's string of financial losses, there has been speculation it might have cut back on aircraft maintenance. That can happen when an airline is strapped for cash. But a reputation for safety is key to financial recovery, and U.S. Air insists there have been no cutbacks. Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration stepped up its surveillance of U.S. Air operations after the earlier crashes, and has pronounced those operations satisfactory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940916","headline":"Assault Weapons Ban Just Won't Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/opinion/l-assault-weapons-ban-just-won-t-work-260967.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   President Clinton has now signed the crime bill (front page, Sept. 14).
