This rank-breaking severely rattled the White House, but Mr. Nixon's strategists remained confident that the President would survive. It wasn't until April 29 that Mr. Nixon finally succumbed to pressures from all sides and released the transcripts of the tapes. That was the moment, as I reflect on it, when one knew that the king must die.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940808","headline":"Abroad at Home; Time To Be Serious","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/opinion/abroad-at-home-time-to-be-serious.html","abstract":"  For more than two years Bosnian Serb leaders have been tweaking the nose of the powers trying to stop their aggression and genocide.

It was the opening weekend of the Festival of Contemporary Music, whose directorship has transferred to the brilliant, free-thinking Dutch conductor Reinbert de Leeuw. A friend of the new regime proposed that the heavenly weather was symbolic of a more-than-meteorological clearing of the air at Tanglewood, the end of a long 12-tone reign by Northeastern academic composers.   An exaggeration, of course: Tanglewood was host to a wide range of contemporary programming under Oliver Knussen's direction over the last seven years, and the 12-toners will be back in a concert on Monday. But there certainly were some new and unexpected sounds floating out of the new Seiji Ozawa Hall on Saturday afternoon. The brazen, bizarre, curiously danceable music of Louis Andriessen, also from the Netherlands, formed the centerpiece of a four-hour concert that also included historical precedents for Mr. Andriessen's style and works by younger composers following in his wake.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940808","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/nyregion/c-corrections-893188.html","abstract":"  An entry in the Addenda listing on the Media Business page on Thursday about the advertising account review of Cub Foods Inc. included erroneous information supplied by Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York, the winner of the account.

Singers, and for that matter instrumentalists, want to do big pieces in recital, and so an orchestra is boiled down to grand-piano size. When the process reverses, as it did at Friday evening's Mostly Mozart concert in Avery Fisher Hall, listeners may stop and wonder. Hermann Prey singing Schubert with Gerard Schwarz's Festival Orchestra gave them a chance to do just that.   Enlargement of musical means may or may not enlarge the experience of beauty, but it almost certainly alters it. Indeed, changing the character of Schubert's piano originals comes close to creating another song. Even when the orchestrators are Liszt, Webern, Britten or Felix Mottl, such transactions become a little slippery. The potential to warp and mislead is at least as great as the ability to enhance and instruct.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940808","headline":"It's Another Jam Session on L. I.

The race was run before a crowd of 58,177, a record for Saratoga, while 12,880 more watched by television at Aquaduct in Queens. T-shirts were given away at both tracks.   Boundary, third choice in the betting, was taken from the railing toward the outside by his rider, John Velasquez, and he stayed there stalking Dalhart until the turn for home. Dalhart, one of the Loblolly Stable's candidates for the Triple Crown last year, faded to sixth place after that. But Boundary took the lead and held it while Cherokee Run made a late but losing dash to take second by half a length over I Can't Believe.   The winner, owned by Mrs. William Haggin Perry and trained by Bill Mott, ran the six furlongs in a rousing 1:083/5 , just three-fifths of a second off the track record, and paid $10.40 for $2. He had been a perfect 5 for 5 until July, when he ran second and third at Belmont Park.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940808","headline":"The Watergate Myth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/opinion/the-watergate-myth.html","abstract":"Over the last 20 years, the otherwise harmless noun \"Watergate\" has accumulated so many uses as a synonym for the various forms of political corruption that it now brings to mind not only the building of that name on the Potomac but also a fortress of evil intent constructed along the lines of Darth Vader's death star.\n\nPressed into service as both symbol and metaphor for almost everything that went wrong in the United States from 1968 to 1974, the word connotes not only the treachery and near-impeachment of President Richard Nixon but also the failure of the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Robert F.

Couples closed out his first victory of the season -- and the 11th of his career -- with an exclamation point birdie on the final hole, hitting his approach less than two feet from the pin and making the putt for a 270 total. The 36-hole finish, which Couples dreaded, was necessary because the opening round was postponed Thursday by rain. Curtis Strange, Steve Pate and Greg Kraft were tied for third at 276.

Using bent blues phrases, melody notes with the heft of stone and dancing lines, he cleaved his way through the group with an improvisation that was a compendium of the American idiom, of what defines our difference from Europe.   In a sense the whole evening was obsessed with accretion and change, the adding and diminishing of instruments to the core rhythm section, the addition of new American formal rules to pop songs or European marches, the imposition of new melodies in the form of improvisations and the riff. And while the music, with its hellbent entertainment ethos, presents itself as a good time, its rhetorical tools, with their 20th-century modernist sensibility, have enough ramifications and appeal to have changed the course of music in this century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940808","headline":"1944: Soviets to Berlin : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/opinion/IHT-1944-soviets-to-berlin-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] Soviet occupation of Berlin is necessary to keep Germany at peace, according to an article in Pravda, the Communist party organ, quoted today [Aug. 7] by the Moscow radio.

The conscience clause would allow a hospital or doctor to refuse to provide any service on the basis of religious or moral objections. One version also allows health plans and employers to exclude any services from the insurance they provide if they object to them on moral or religious grounds. So while a national health-care plan might cover contraceptive services, Catholic hospitals, for example, could as a matter of Federal law be absolved from providing those services.

They thought it a good idea to jail Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of Nigeria's canceled presidential vote in June 1993, when he claimed the office two months ago. Mr. Abiola was charged with treason and held incommunicado. But behind bars he has become a symbol known to more people around the world than is Gen. Sani Abacha, the faceless soldier who currently presides over Nigeria's permanent Government caste.    After Mr. Abiola was detained in Abuja, Nigeria's political capital, strikes and demonstrations paralyzed Lagos, the commercial capital. In a clumsy attempt to foil the pro-democracy campaign, the military then offered to release Mr. Abiola on condition that he not talk to the press or address political rallies. When he refused, his defiance proved contagious.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940810","headline":"Connors Misses Flair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/10/sports/sports-people-tennis-connors-misses-flair.html","abstract":"  Love him or leave him, most tennis fans would agree that JIMMY CONNORS had a certain flair on the tennis court.

Ames, the C.I.A. officer who was then spying for Moscow, detected deception in two of his answers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said today.   The results of the tests, administered routinely by the C.I.A.'s Office of Security to officers who hold sensitive posts, have been reviewed by the F.B.I. in recent months as part of the bureau's continuing inquiry into the case of Mr. Ames, who was arrested in February and has since pleaded guilty of espionage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940810","headline":"In Campaign to Curb Bad Student Loans, U.S. Warns of Audits, and Colleges Protest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/10/us/in-campaign-to-curb-bad-student-loans-us-warns-of-audits-and-colleges-protest.html","abstract":"  Eager to show that it is trying to stanch a $2 billion annual drain in bad student loans, the Department of Education warned 2,000 colleges and universities last week that their finances since 1988 would be reviewed and their Federal financing would be in jeopardy if they do not get their records in order.

The mystery surrounding the derailment grew murkier yesterday, as toxicology tests showed that the engineer, the conductor and three assistant conductors were all sober. Moreover, an extensive mechanical inspection of a set of wheels believed to be the first to derail revealed no flaws that would explain the cause of the wreck, Federal officials said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940810","headline":"Sports of The Times; Now Rangers Have a Duty To Amuse Us","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/10/sports/sports-of-the-times-now-rangers-have-a-duty-to-amuse-us.html","abstract":"  IN the coming post-baseball era, we must all find ways to occupy our time.

How wrenching to learn that something so airy and tasty, and required for movie watching, is unhealthful!\n\nThe shock still lingers, and some theater chains are trying to clean up their act.

But now the journal -- 170 pages of musings, poetry, letters to Kahlo's husband, the great muralist Diego Rivera, and drawings and paintings that have never been exhibited -- is being offered in an auction, to American publishers.    For the many admirers of Kahlo, a Mexican painter known for her sometimes brutal self-portraits who was largely unrecognized in her lifetime, the diary presents a rich trove of new material about her art and life. \"The pictures are much freer than her paintings,\" said Hayden Herrera, the author of a 1983 biography of Kahlo, who was given rare permission to see the journal as she researched the book. \"This would be an eye-opener for people who think that Frida Kahlo is a rigid self-portraitist.
