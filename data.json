His inventive narrative, which combines elements of cop drama, mob caper and suspense thriller, takes its theme from a mesmerizing lecture on the innate brutality of men and apes, delivered by a scientist whose wife was murdered and who knows too much about mob business for his own good. The tension comes from the efforts of Dante Stagnaro, the head of the San Francisco Police Department's Organized Crime Task Force, to protect the scientist from a brilliant hit man who calls himself Raptor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Princeton Borough Journal;\nLibrary Is Suffering From Lack of Space","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/princeton-borough-journal-library-is-suffering-from-lack-of-space.html","abstract":"AT the Princeton Public Library, 120,000 volumes are jammed onto shelves designed to hold just 80,000.

Though set in London and free of poeticizing, \"Paddywack\" is as Irish as anything by Brian Friel. The scale of the play is small, but it's also as politically committed as Sean O'Casey's early work. By saying that, I don't mean to place Mr. Magee, who comes from the Roman Catholic working class in Belfast, in a league with either Mr. Friel or O'Casey. It's only to emphasize that on the basis of this one play, he seems to be a refreshingly aggressive new Irish voice. No sad songs for him. He speaks tough, efficient prose.   \"Paddywack\" is initially about bigotry, but it's also about politics. At the play's center is Damien, a young Belfast construction worker who says he has come to London looking for work. He's polite and wellspoken, but he's also terribly sure of himself. For a member of the working class, he has a surprisingly large vocabulary, as well as the kind of ferocious wit that withers the opposition in any argument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Budapest's Museums of Everyday Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/travel/budapests-museums-of-everyday-life.html","abstract":"In a small country like Hungary, nothing, it seems, is too trivial to enshrine: Budapest, the capital, is filled with museums of daily life that pay tribute to everything from the telephone to the tram, pastries to pharmaceuticals, ads to animal husbandry.

Across campus, in Sevilla Cottage, Kevin King's room -- decorated with paintings he did, plants and posters of reggae stars -- is equally appealing. \n\nMs. Banks, 17, has been at Leake & Watts for three months; Mr. King, for three years. Although their living quarters are homey, their situations are temporary.\n\nLike the other residents, they needed supervised living because their parents were unable to care for them, or because they were getting into trouble; like the other residents, they will eventually return to family members or get places of their own.\n\nWhile they are at Leake & Watts, residents attend school, get jobs, go out with friends, cook, clean, buy clothes and CD's, rent videos -- all the things people do when they are not living in an institution.\n\n\"We are trying to prepare young people for life,\" said James Campbell, executive director, adding that there are many vocational and counseling programs as well. \"They learn responsibility; they learn how to relate to other people and how to express themselves. A lot of our people go on to be great successes.\"\n\nLeake & Watts, a children's welfare agency, is on 30 acres in a southwest corner of Yonkers on the Riverdale border. It serves 1,000 people ranging from infants to 21 years old. Eight hundred are living in foster homes in Westchester and the Bronx; 100 are in group homes in the Bronx, and 100 live on campus -- in a total of 10 houses that are 1920's Tudor style or 1950's Colonial or 1960's California modern.\n\nIn addition to the houses, which are known as cottages, there is a school building and the 100-year-old administration building, and there are 10 new \"cottages\" on the grounds. \n\nAlthough they are still little more than steel frames, staff and residents are looking forward to their open floor plans, big windows to let in lots of sun and expanded areas for recreation. They will be completed in the summer of 1996 and will house an additional 55 residents.\n\nThe $39 million project, which also includes renovation of existing buildings, is being paid for by the State Dormitory Authority and was designed by the architect Richard Dattner of Manhattan. \n\nIt represents a historic occasion of sorts, said Dennis Castro, associate executive director of Leake & Watts. The Dormitory Authority in the past has granted money for the building of universities and schools, but not living quarters. \"The architects actually stayed in the old buildings, which are also being renovated, to see what was good and what should be changed,\" Mr. Castro said. \"They really lived with our residents.\" \n\nLeake & Watts opened in 1831 in upper Manhattan as the Leake & Watts Orphanage with funds from the estates of John George Leake and Robert Watts. \n\nInitially its residents were all boys, and all, as described in institutional literature, full orphans with both parents dead or missing. By 1851, girls were admitted; in 1888, the institution bought its current property and had the grounds designed by Frederick Law Olmstead. The Gothic-style main building -- now used for administrative offices -- was said to be \"typical of the days when orphans were housed in large dormitories containing rows upon rows of little cots.\" \n\nIn the early years, a child would usually stay until he was 21, at which point he would go into an indenturing program with farmers upstate. (The average stay is now two years.) \n\nBy 1908, Leake & Watts was admitting half orphans -- children whose homes had broken up because of poverty. The next two decades saw major changes, with the addition of a school, replacement of the dormitory with the cottage system and the diversification of the population. From the 1930's to today, the institution has expanded in size and scope and now offers a variety of services to a varied clientele. \n\nThe image of an orphan, for example, is no longer that of a freckle-faced, parentless boy who gets in trouble for stealing a hot mickey (potato) from someone else's trash-bin fire. \n\nThese days, a typical Leake & Watts resident is likely to have a living mother and father, but the parents may be overwhelmed by problems associated with poverty -- drug use, AIDS, involvement in crime.\n\nIn other cases, it is not the parents or lack of them but the youngster who requires placement: truancy, rocky relationships at home and with peers or, as one resident put it, \"too much hanging out on the street\" can result in a court-ordered placement.\n\n\"Poverty causes problems,\" said Phyllis Gurdin, assistant executive director in charge of resident programs. \"Desertion comes with poverty -- the father leaves, the family breaks up.\" \n\nA graph of admissions over the years, she added, shows correlation between peak population at the home and societal upheavals: the 1848 potato famine, the Civil War in 1860, the huge waves of immigrants in the early 1900's, and so on, through the Depression, World War II and the prevalence of crack cocaine, heroin and AIDS in the 1990's.\n\nOver the years, too, the racial and ethnic mix at Leake & Watts has changed from primarily Italian and Irish in the founding years to the current population, which is 90 percent black and Hispanic. \n\nSocial theory and statistics, however, mean little to the Leake & Watts residents who are concentrating on making lives for themselves.\n\nDatayna Jordan has been there for five years, since she was 12. A soft-spoken girl with big expressive eyes, she is one of nine children. She is at Leake & Watts, she said, because \"something bad happened to my mom, not because I was acting up in school or anything.\" Now, she added, her mother is \"getting her life back together\" and so is she.\n\n\"You get opportunities here you don't find elsewhere,\" she said. \"Last summer, I got to go to F.I.T. -- I might like to go into fashion, or maybe do hair for a living.\"\n\nMs. Banks, who would like a career in journalism, is working as a secretary for one of Leake & Watts's off-campus programs. She became a resident \"because I was having a little communication problem with my mother.\" She said she found the change difficult at first:\n\n\"When you live in a house with one parent, one sister and one brother, it's hard to come into a setting where you are living with eight girls and have to share things and make compromises.\" Now, though, things are looking up: \"I like having a job, and I like learning about responsibility.\" \n\nMr. King credits some of his biggest personal successes to the Leake & Watts staff. \"Brian and Vladimir made me who I am today,\" he said, referring to Brian Lyons, a child-care worker, and Vladimir Carvajal, assistant director of residential programs. \n\nThe two encouraged his artistic abilities -- in his room are a beach scene and a seascape he painted -- and helped him understand not only his talents but also his own temperament. \n\n\"Before I came here, I was running around with a gang,\" he said. \"We weren't real bad or anything, but if someone messed with one of us, we'd beat them up. Like I said, I always kept my hands clean, I never got involved with any real bad stuff. But I needed to be away from that scene, I needed something else.\n\n\"Vladimir and Brian coaxed me to do the best I could do. They taught me to deal with people and to deal with my anger. Now I get along very well with everyone here.\n\n\"I don't think of myself as a leader, but people tell me I am. I guess because I feel good about myself, I find myself in a leadership role.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"School District on Redrawing Board, and Tempers Flare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/neighborhood-report-canarsie-east-flatbush-school-district-redrawing-board.html","abstract":"  For a decade, residents of Canarsie have enjoyed a sweet deal on their school board.

Rowland PRODUCER: Greg Stevens & Company, Alexandria, Va. SCRIPT: Mr. Rowland: \"I don't blame you for being disgusted with politics. I'm pretty disgusted too. As you know, The Hartford Courant and some of my political enemies will do anything to stop us. They want you to believe that something awful occurred between my former wife and me. But that's not true. We've had our problems, but they don't belong in a political campaign. Protecting my children from this media madness is more important to me than this election. All I ask is that you look beyond the desperate politics and join us for a real change in Connecticut.\" VISUAL: John Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor and a former Congressman, speaks directly to the camera, in front of a gray backdrop. The words, \"John Rowland for Governor,\" appear at the bottom of the screen at the beginning and end of the ad. ACCURACY: Mr. Rowland was divorced earlier this year, and it is true that for the several months The Hartford Courant has tried to obtain documents regarding a police visit to the house of Mr. Rowland's former wife, Deborah, in response to an argument between the two of them. The Middlebury Police have released a brief summary of the incident, describing it as a \"nonviolent\" family dispute, but the town and both Rowlands have opposed providing any additional documents. The Hartford Courant is challenging this position before the state's Freedom of Information Commission.   The newspaper's stories about the incident have not been featured prominently and have never speculated about or hinted at what may have occurred. Its coverage has focused on the legal wrangling over whether the documents should be available to the public. Similar stories have appeared in other newspapers and on television and radio news programs. None of Mr. Rowland's gubernatorial opponents have referred to the stories; it is unclear to whom he is referring when he mentions \"political enemies.\" SCORECARD: Mr. Rowland has been the front-runner in the race since January, but in recent weeks his lead has narrowed, and he appears to be losing support among Republican women. This commercial is a bold attempt by Mr. Rowland to defuse a growing problem. Attacking the media has sometimes worked well for candidates; the risk is that the commercial will add fuel to the fire, sustaining the controversy and making more people aware of it.

It has also revealed deep divisions over whether the vendors' removal has left Harlem better off.    It is a question complicated by a number of factors. Foremost among them has been displaced vendors' continued picketing of stores on 125th Street, urging shoppers to boycott businesses not owned by black merchants. And with some merchants saying that their already-fragile businesses are beginning to feel the impact of the picketing and vendors saying they have effectively lost their jobs, there is no unanimity of opinion in Harlem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Owners To Remove $1 Billion Guarantee","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/sports/baseball-owners-to-remove-1-billion-guarantee.html","abstract":"  The salary-cap proposal that triggered the strike that killed the World Series is about to become even less appealing to the players.

Such is the case with Joseph Horowitz's fascinating new book, \"Wagner Nights: An American History.\" One of its illustrations is a cover from a concert program of July 6, 1889. \"Brighton Beach\" proclaims the heading, in letters ornamented with banners. Underneath is a sketch of the 3,000-seat seaside music pavilion that was once a major attraction in Brooklyn. There, for eight summers, Anton Seidl conducted members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in concerts that drew workers and children, wealthy sponsors and Coney Island tourists, with the promise of compositions by Beethoven, Liszt, Grieg, Mendelssohn, Dvorak and, most often, Wagner. Attendance records were broken not by barbershop quartets but by concerts featuring works like Walther's Prize Song from \"Die Meistersinger.\"   \"All the social and intellectual factors of Brooklyn life are present,\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote of Seidl's concerts, \"and the crowd there is unlike any gathered anywhere outside of Bayreuth.\" According to The Musical Courier, the audiences were quieter than those in Manhattan concert halls; during the concerts the nearby Coney Island beaches were deserted. The concerts were sponsored by the Seidl Society, an organization of women who adored Wagner and were transported by the abilities of the conductor, who had studied with the master. The concert program showed a woman gazing into space, hearing, no doubt, strains of Wagner to the accompaniment of breakers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Whither the Universe?

The capital of a state with an economy the size of Argentina's, Sao Paulo is home to 17 million people and headquarters for most of Brazil's banks and leading corporations. In a change from Rio, visitors to Sao Paulo typically have more cause to don a business suit than a bathing suit, but as in Rio they should be cautious when walking the streets. With Brazil's economy rapidly opening to foreign investment and trade, more and more of the visitors filling hotels here are Americans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"A Fondness For the Famous","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/neighborhood-report-canarsie-east-flatbush-a-fondness-for-the-famous.html","abstract":"  When it comes to human beings, Louis Schlamowitz has no favorites.

Nearly 200 years after he lived there, the pristine nature sanctuary and its grand old stone mansion evoke the spirit of the Haitian-born French emigre whose lively, accurate watercolors -- owned by the New-York Historical Society and now on national tour (they will be at the Historical Society May 3 to Aug. 6, 1995) -- revolutionized the art of bird illustration. \"Its fine woodlands, its extensive acres, its fields crowned with evergreens, offered many subjects to my pencil,\" Audubon wrote of Mill Grove in his journal. \"It was there that I commenced my simple and agreeable studies, with as little concern about the future as if the world had been made for me.\"\n\nMill Grove, the Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary, includes 170 acres of thick forests, steep slopes, open meadows and lawns surrounding a handsome fieldstone house on the east bank of the Perkiomen Creek. A tributary of the Schuylkill River, the creek forms part of the Delaware Valley flyway through which diverse birds migrate each year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Where's the Money?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/books/where-s-the-money.html","abstract":"  A PIECE OF THE ACTION How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class.

Stein's carefully researched exhibition catalogue takes a judicious approach to providing an answer for the work of Horace Pippin (1888-1946). A self-taught painter and resident of West Chester, Pa., Pippin came to prominence in the late 1930's and 40's through the efforts of a number of white critics, curators and patrons, including the Philadelphia collector Albert C. Barnes. In his catalogue essay for Pippin's first solo show in 1940, Barnes called Pippin \"the first important Negro painter to appear on the American scene.\" Included in the \"Masters of Popular Painting\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1938, Pippin became a key figure at the intersection of two important trends in the history of modern art in the United States: scene painting and primitivism. Pippin's bold, simplified domestic scenes, landscapes, portraits and history paintings synthesized the two, making his work highly marketable to an audience eager to prove its own sophistication through its very modern appreciation of so-called primitive art. A particular strength of \"I Tell My Heart\" is its attention to the relations between Pippin and the nexus of dealers, patrons, critics and curators who promoted and collected his work. For as Judith Wilson, who teaches art history at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, points out in another essay, Pippin's example \"refutes a stereotype -- that of the self-taught artist as a socio-cultural isolate.\" Ms. Stein, an adjunct curator at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, has assembled a catalogue that offers great insight not only into Pippin's work, but also into the American art world of the 1930's and 40's.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"The New Fit And Flare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/style/on-the-street-the-new-fit-and-flare.html","abstract":"  Two major fashion trends were seen in the audience at the spring fashion collections in Paris last week: the knee-length hemline and the revival of the feminine princess line.

The rumors don't make much sense since the expansion team already has a general manager, but they are there nonetheless.   Pam Reeves has heard the rumors and has one thing to say: Don't believe them. She knows. She knows Dan Reeves better than anyone and in her first extensive interview since arriving in New York last year, she said her husband isn't going anywhere and will fulfill his five-year contract.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Every Faith Takes Its Own Path to the Sacred","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/opinion/l-every-faith-takes-its-own-path-to-the-sacred-606480.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Why So Many Religions?\" (Op-Ed, Oct. 17): John Paul II affirms the significant stride made 30 years ago by the Roman Catholic Church in recognizing that truth can be found in other religions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"3-Way Contest in the 19th After All","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/3-way-contest-in-the-19th-after-all.html","abstract":"  WHEN Joseph J.

He was a little taken aback that it had slightly predated the era of Britain's \"angry young men\" playwrights, which began with John Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\" (1956). But when Mr. Curtis learned that no kinescopes existed of many of the 1950's American television plays, he decided to remake them.   \"Marty,\" Paddy Chayefsky's story of a lonely young butcher who falls in love, was his first choice, but he soon learned that getting remake rights for that film would be very complicated. So Mr. Curtis started looking at the nine other plays Chayefsky had written for NBC's \"Philco TV Playhouse,\" and he found \"The Mother.\" Tomorrow night at 9, a new production, starring Anne Bancroft and Joan Cusack in roles originated by Cathleen Nesbitt and Maureen Stapleton in 1954, will be shown on PBS's Great Performances series.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941023","headline":"Costume Maker's Prepared for Any Need","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/nyregion/costume-maker-s-prepared-for-any-need.html","abstract":"  THERE are sure to be at least six Elvis sightings in northern New Jersey this Halloween and reports of close encounters with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers will be almost countless, according to the management of a costume maker here called A Costume Factory.    \"Power Rangers are the biggest thing for the kids this Halloween,\" said R.

Ms. Lam's \"Sudden Thunder,\" a world premiere, lingers longest in the mind. It is an altogether mesmerizing sequence of meticulously detailed sonorities, swiftly moving from passages of static meditation to lashings of full orchestral force. The lutelike pipa, played exquisitely by Wu Man, held its own against the ensemble, sometimes delivering pointillistic splashes of dissociated tones, sometimes strumming fragments of Chinese folk melody.

Last February, Dr. James H. Marden, a biologist at Pennsylvania State University, and Melissa G. Kramer, his student, began studying the behavior and biology of stoneflies -- the immature nymphs of which are familiar to many fishermen as delicacies for trout.
