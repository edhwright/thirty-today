This summer that cool, comfortable ride has been a rare thing indeed.

The problem: the Plexiglas partitions that separate drivers from passengers keep the cool air in the front. The partitions were once optional.

Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/nyregion/corruption-in-uniform-chronology-tracking-police-corruption-over-the-years.html","abstract":"  Sept. 23, 1986: More than a decade after the Knapp Commission focused wide attention on corruption among the police and after years of relative quiet, the police department is rocked by the arrests of eleven officers from the 77th Precinct in Bedford-Stuvesant who knocked down doors, stole money and drugs from drug dealers and resold the stolen drugs. The \"Buddy Boys\" case is the department's first major corruption scandal since the Knapp Commission exposed organized \"pads\" that ran extortion operations out of nearly every precinct house. It was out of the Knapp Commission that the Internal Affairs Division was born. Oct. 31, 1986: Twenty-seven supervisors are transferred out of the precinct by Commissioner Benjamin Ward, but no need is seen for an investigation of the department's anti-corruption efforts. March 1991: Apparently no corruption troubles are in sight. The state disbands the office of Special Prosecutor for corruption and agres to give money to the district attorneys to fight corruption. To date, only a fraction of the money promised has been delivered. May 7, 1992: A group of six New York City police officers, led by Officer Michael Dowd, are arrested for cocaine trafficking by the Suffolk County police, raising a host of questions about oversign and the Blue Wall of Silence. Why didn't the department's own investigators uncover the scandal in light of flagrant misconduct over many years by Officer Dowd? Had the department looked the other way? One person, anyway, sees no major cracks. Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown calls the department's system for weeding out corruption \"a system that police agencies across the country look to.\" June 25, 1992: Mayor David N. Dinkins announces the creation of a special panel to investigate corruption, and as its head, names Milton Mollen, a former judge and former Deputy Mayor for public safety, as well as a close friend. Commissioner Brown, who opposed the panel, was conspicuously absent from the announcement. June 29, 1992: Commissioner Brown finally acknowledges a problem. He announces tougher anti-corruption measures that on the surface seem rather basic. Investigators will finally be supplied with modern surveillance equipment and even new cars that will help them avoid detection from officers under scrutiny. He also asks his top deputy, Raymond W. Kelly, to prepare a report on why the department failed to stop Officer Dowd. But law enforcement officials say the response is too late, that the Internal Affairs Division had been bungling cases for years. One officials calls it a \"secret waiting to come out.\" July 30, 1992: More problems for Michael Dowd. He is arrested on Federal charges that he took huge weekly cash payments from drug gangs. Officials say he offered protection from police raids and in return took in as much as $8,000 a week. Nov. 16, 1992: Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announces a major revamping of the Internal Affairs monitoring system, starting with an upgrading of its status to Internal Affairs Bureau and creating more accountability among investigators. Mollen Commission officials say the changes do not go nearly far enough. Sept. 27, 1993: The Mollen Commission begins the city's first public hearings on police corruption in more than 20 years with a star witness: Michael Dowd. He says that early in his career other officers indoctrinated him with the attitude: \"never rat against another cop.\" There is testimony from a hooded informant named \"Mr. X\" and from former police officials and investigators who reveal tales of corruption and brutality in the 9th Precinct in the East Village and in many of the city's minority communities. It is learned that Internal Affairs has long maintained a secret \"tickler\" file for charges made against its own investigators, rather than pass the allegations on to prosecutors. Dec. 28, 1993: An interim report released by the Mollen Commission is a sign of things to come. The commission declares the department \"incompetent\" in policing itself. March 8, 1994: The commission produces its first criminal case when three officers from the 73d Precinct in Brownsville are charged with dealing drugs, usually while on duty. The officers called themselves the Morgue Boys because they often met divide their profits outside a factory that had once manufactured refrigerators for morgues. March 18, 1994: Three officers from the 30th Precinct are caught on videotape beating up Harlem residents and stealing drugs and cash. Eleven more officers from the precinct will eventually be arrested. And another new police commissioner, William J. Bratton, tries to put his own stamp on the corruption battle. He pronounces that no one will ever wear the badges of the arrested officers. To date, he has transferred eight of 22 supervisors from the precinct, as well as 25 of the precinct's 191 officers, many on suspicions that they knew about corruption but did not tell. July 6, 1994: The Commission's final report is issued. Its central proposal is the creation of an independent commission, appointed by the Mayor, to review police department efforts to eliminate corruption and to conduct its own investigations.

That is a worthy goal, but the timing is amateurish and the underlying message is troubling.

It is a multifaceted problem that has flourished in parts of our city not only because of opportunity and greed, but because of a police culture that exalts loyalty over integrity; because of the silence of honest officers who fear the consequences of \"ratting\" on another cop no matter how grave the crime; because of willfully blind supervisors who fear the consequences of a corruption scandal more than corruption itself; because of the demise of the principle of accountability that makes all commanders responsible for fighting corruption in their commands; because of a hostility and alienation between the police and community in certain precincts which breeds an \"us versus them\" mentality, and because for years the New York City Police Department abandoned its responsibility to insure the integrity of its members.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Haiti Adds Rape To Asylum Claims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/opinion/l-haiti-adds-rape-to-asylum-claims-606146.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your June 26 report on the difficulty Haitian rape victims face in proving their asylum claims, as detailed in the case of an activist who fled after having been assaulted by four police agents, highlights the inadequacy of our present asylum system in dealing with the claims of women.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"U.S. TROOPS STAGE MILITARY EXERCISE WITH EYE ON HAITI","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/world/standoff-haiti-us-strategy-us-troops-stage-military-exercise-with-eye-haiti.html","abstract":"  Stepping up preparations for a possible invasion of Haiti to oust its military leaders, United States forces have secretly rehearsed a plan to seize airfields and ports there, Pentagon officials said today.

Nevertheless, over and over again, the festival pulls off a handful of concerts that are truly special.   This year's festival was no exception, and most of the epiphanies came from the least likely places. A concert built around the pianist Dick Hyman, a fine player and historian but hardly known for his transcendental abilities, turned out to be, well, transcendental. Mel Torme, the 68-year-old singer, performed a concert full of bravura and showmanship and stunning musicality, which was a pleasure both for the musicians and the audience. And at what could have been a jam session run amok, last Friday night's tribute to the Rev.

Throughout the evening, as every permutation of these alternative rock mainstays played solo songs, House of Freaks duets, Steve Wynn Quartet songs and songs by all five of them under the name Gutterball, they joked and grumbled about how limiting three hours was. (The concert wound up lasting three and a half hours.)   Mr. Wynn and friends seemed to have a bottomless coffer of rock songs about traveling America's lonely highways, escaping from the daily pressures of life and falling out of love.

Now we are accustomed to experiencing completeness not only on paper but in performance and on recordings as well. The coming centennial of the death of Verdi, in 2001, has inspired at least two surveys of Verdi's operatic canon, one by Covent Garden and one by the more modestly proportioned New York Grand Opera. The New York series began on Wednesday night with a performance of Verdi's \"Oberto\" in Central Park.   The value of this sort of endeavor depends on the case at hand. With a composer like Brahms, who edited his own work severely and maintained an astonishing consistency of inspiration, a complete-works survey is revelatory. A volcanically prolific figure like Schubert, on the other hand, makes a rather overwhelming and wearying effect in concentrated chronological doses. (I've experienced both in radio presentations.) Verdi falls somewhere in between; some of his operas are unquestionably better than others, the last operas tower majestically above the first, and yet even the most obscure works have something singular and satisfying about them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"A Sour Note on Concert Prices","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/opinion/a-sour-note-on-concert-prices.html","abstract":"  Pearl Jam, a \"grunge\" rock band out of Seattle, wanted to please its largely teen-age audience by setting ticket prices for a summer tour under $20 -- far below the usual prices of $50 to $60.

Ms. McLachlan, a Canadian performer with a sweet sobbing voice, writes intriguing but largely private reflections on the loss of innocence.

One of tonight's opening features, the alluring, little-known 1937 film \"Gueule d'Amour,\" features Jean Gabin as a Foreign Legionnaire in the south of France. Known as Lover Boy (Gueule d'Amour), he has the society matrons complaining; in the last six months they have lost nine maids, all distracted by his charms.

He has been running his own show as Prospect Park's resident storyteller for the last two summers. He was discovered, he said, by Betsy Gotbaum, the former Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation, and Tupper Thomas, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance. He said they saw him informally performing in the park and wanted to sign him up, but they didn't know for what. Then the storytelling job, sponsored by the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation, turned up, and he was hired as a raconteur. (Keats was a children's book author and illustrator in the 1960's and 70's whose settings were mostly urban.)   Cooper-Moore's storytelling sessions begin with parables or riddles, move to a medium-length tale and finish with a longish tale, all folk stories he has mostly heard from others. There were the Polish and Czech workers in the building where he lives in East Harlem who told him stories. Tales repeated by African neighbors have also enhanced his repertory. Then there's the baby a friend of his has recently adopted from China, who may come on Sunday, and for whom he will dig up stories. \"I've been reading Chinese meditations and the country's history,\" he said in his ribbon-smooth accent from the Piedmont region of Virginia.   His storytelling turns eclectic when accompanied by his songs, which he writes and plays on his hand-made instruments. \"This year, I'll be writing songs for each program,\" he says. What more could a child ask for on a Sunday afternoon? (Ice cream.)   The free storytelling is on Sundays at 1 and 2 P.M. through Aug. 28. The D train, stopping at Prospect Park, is the closest subway. Another free storytelling program is held on Mondays and Thursdays at the Third Street Playground (entrance at Prospect Park West and Third Street; Park Slope side) at 4 P.M. daily except Mondays through Aug. 1.   In Central Park, storytellers have been congregating at the Hans Christian Andersen statue for 37 years; Diane Wolkstein, the director, is in her 27th year. The stories told there on Saturdays from 11 A.M. to noon are not just those of Andersen, but also tales from the Grimm brothers, along with stories from Borneo, Haiti and China.   Tomorrow, Marcia Lane and Ulf Arnstrom are to be telling Scandinavian stories. Ms. Lane is to start with Hans Christian Andersen's story \"The Collar,\" in which a man's shirt collar seeks a wife. He romances a comb, an iron and scissors, but is turned down flat. He ends up being made into paper, upon which his story is written. \"Isn't that like life?\" Ms. Lane added.   Mr. Arnstrom, an editor of a Swedish storytelling journal, is flying in from Stockholm to tell Swedish folk tales in his soft, gentle voice. His program, in English, is to center on \"The Pearl,\" in which three women claim ownership of a lustrous sea gem. Whoever makes the biggest fool of her husband gets the pearl. (What a sense of humor Scandinavians can have.)   The free programs, held rain or shine, run through Sept. 24. Adults are asked to remain with their children. 'A Lady Named Jo'    Queens Children's Theater   256-21 Union Turnpike, at 257th Street   Glen Oaks   (718) 343-1052   Recommended ages: 7 and up   Through Sunday    Jo and her sisters, from Louisa May Alcott's novel \"Little Women,\" all appear in this musical for children, only they're less agreeable. \"The ultrasweetness in the book has been removed,\" said Ben Finn, who wrote the play's book with Peter John Stephens. That may come as a relief to some potential audience members, although children, especially girls, fall in love with the March sorority no matter what. The story is told from Jo's perspective as a middle-aged woman looking back.   This play has 23 songs on a recorded track, making the production seem almost operatic. The two-hour show (with an intermission), is tonight at 7 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 P.M. Tickets are $10; $6 for children. From July 20 to 24, it is to be performed at Inner-Space Theater, 134 West 26th Street, Chelsea; information: (212) 989-2969. Model Ship Sailing   Chess and Backgammon    Bryant Park   Avenue of the Americas, at 40th Street   (212) 983-4142   Recommended ages: 3 and up   Through October    Three years ago, Robbie Biederman had an enterprising idea, and his father, Dan Biederman, the executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, took action. Inspiration blew in when Robbie, who is now 7, was visiting the Luxembourg Gardens and the Tuileries during a family vacation in Paris. Why couldn't children race model sailboats in the Bryant Park fountain back home in New York City?   \"I thought it was too small,\" Mr. Biederman said of the Josephine Shaw Lowell fountain, \"but we tested some boats and it turned out to be a perfect size.\" Patina Milon, an 8-year-old from New York City, spent a half hour one day last week circling the pink-granite fountain with her rented model Henley, the jib luffing uncontrollably.   The model sailboats, which may be rented for $2 an hour, are attached with strings for navigating. The boats were made and lent by Fred Hutchins, the owner of Jan's Hobby Shop on the Upper East Side. Two boats were stolen a few weeks ago, leaving only three.   Bryant Park is also offering chess and backgammon lessons and sets to rent for games at the Parisian cafe-style chairs and tables. (The park really does have a Gallic air, even though the fountain is Italian Renaissance style and is named after an American suffragist.) The New York Chess and Backgammon club is the sponsor. A free lesson is arranged for first-time players; thereafter, you may pay from $30 to $100 for an hour's lesson with masters, senior masters and grandmasters. If you simply wish to play, the fees are 50 cents a game for each player for speed chess (10 minutes or less); $4 an hour for each player for slow chess (more than 20 minutes); 50 cents a game for each player for backgammon, and $4 an hour for each player for checkers.   The sailing, lessons and games are daily from 11:30 A.M. to sundown, weather permitting. They are at the 41st Street entrance. Lessons may be scheduled by calling the club at (212) 302-5874. Little West Street Path    West Street at West Thames Street   Battery Park City   Lower Manhattan   (212) 416-5300   Recommended for all ages    A new pathway for in-line skaters, bicyclists (with and without training wheels), tricyclists, runners, dogs, roller skaters and skateboarders has been created along the West Side Highway, almost along the waterfront. Crickets can be heard at dusk in the shrubs behind the wrought-iron fence; a breeze slips in from the Hudson. The straightaway, as flat as a mesa top and illuminated at night, allows no cars. It is four blocks long and has sidewalks on both sides; a cul-de-sac has benches. The pathway will ultimately be a service road for buildings going up on adjacent empty lots, so enjoy it while it lasts.   Not far away, at the Vesey Street entrance to Hudson River Park, the New York City Police Department's Troop A mounted unit exercises its horses in a new ring, usually every morning or afternoon. (There is no set schedule.) If you're lucky, you can see the horses doing serpentines and figure eights, but not chasing bad guys.   And have you checked out the new 27-foot-wide pathway in the West Village, running from Little West 12th Street to Harrison Street off the West Side Highway? One TriBeCa mother said it had changed her life, as she can now glide safely on her in-line skates to retrieve her car at a parking lot. For now, the pathway, part of the Hudson River Park Conservancy's urban boulevard plan, ends at the northern end of Hudson River Park, at Stuyvesant High School. Other skaters have already discovered the path, but there's room for everyone. An attractive fence keeps you from stumbling into the river, although the fence is completed only down to Hubert Street; a concrete wall separates the path from the highway. A lot of people use the route at sunset.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"Top Spot Remains Yankee Domain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/sports/baseball-top-spot-remains-yankee-domain.html","abstract":"  The Yankees were getting more tense, more nervous and more paranoid than normal as their losses escalated, their division lead disintegrated and their lack of fans at Yankee Stadium received increased exposure.

De Kooning is to the east, American and French landscape painting of the 19th and 20th centuries to the west. In between are shows devoted to American naive painting and to an overlooked Abstract Expressionist, Robert Richenburg. (In addition, a retrospective of the painter Joan Snyder is to open at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton on Sunday.) Roslyn Harbor    One of the goofiest exhibitions in recent memory is \"Normandy and Its Artists Remembered\" at the Nassau County Museum, an exercise in misplaced patriotism that mixes artistic and military history to the benefit of neither. The show's focus is Normandy, the large region in northwest France whose varied terrain figures prominently in the history of 19th-century and early 20th-century painting. Pre-Impressionists, Impressionists, Fauves and Pointillists alike were successively drawn to its dramatic coastlines and seaside villages and resorts. Further inland lies Giverny, which many American Impressionists, following the path of Monet, began to visit in the late 1880's. As if this weren't enough to tackle, the exhibition commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Europe, in which Normandy also played a crucial role.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"U.S. Troops on the Golan?

Two of the great second-generation be-bop saxophonists share a bill. Phil Woods can be melancholic; when he's not being mechanical, his inventions are given to a kind of melodicism. Jackie McLean is simply one of the great musicians to come out of the 1950's and 60's, with an exploratory sensibility and one of the nastiest tones in jazz, acidic and burned.

Marce et Tumpak, one of the Caribbean's better bands, mixes syntheziers with wooden drums and flute, the modern and the ancient. Like so many other Caribbean groups, the band, from Martinique, is trying to balance the rush of technology with the older, original synthesis.
