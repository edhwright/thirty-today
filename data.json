These exhibitions can create the illusion of broader horizons for the visitor, no mean task in a February like this one, enabling one to traverse a great deal of esthetic terrain in a relatively small amount of space and a minimum of weather. They provide momentary respite from winter's doldrums, when the vision narrows and the mind hunkers down.   In SoHo and on 57th Street there are shows with three or more artists at nearly every turn, in young galleries and blue-chip venues alike. Some focus on one medium; others have a thematic or formal organizing device. Most are in-house efforts, organized by dealers happy to take a break from the steady march of one-person exhibitions; a few bear the imprimatur of independent curators. And one or two even push the envelope of the group show format, suggesting that it can be a provocative art form in itself.  Paula Cooper    \"Pictures of the Real World (In Real Time),\" at the Paula Cooper Gallery (155 Wooster Street, near Houston Street), is an oddly handsome show, organized by Robert Nickas, that measures life and photography, constancy and change. The constants are the austere Conceptual Art date paintings of On Kawara, which here are something akin to wall labels. Announcing dates like \"May 6, 1972\" or \"June 9, 1985,\" these small white-on-black canvases mark off the 28 years of 1966 to 1993 and alternate with 28 photographs, one from each year.   The show's main achievement, other than to give Mr. Kawara's paintings somethings to do, is to trace photography into Conceptual Art and out the other side. It begins with Conceptualists like Dan Graham and Douglas Huebler, includes appropriation artists like Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince and Sherrie Levine and concludes with more idiosyncratic manipulators of the medium like Andres Serrano, Jeanne Dunning and Zoe Leonard. Documentary photographs, primarily by Larry Clark and Diane Arbus, are definitely in the minority. Yet in many ways, reality and how artists with cameras have insinuated it into art are the show's underlying subjects. (Through March 12.) Luhring Augustine    By its very title, \"The Ossuary,\" at Luhring Augustine (130 Prince Street), evokes two of contemporary art's most prevalent subjects: death and the body. The show, which has been organized by Diego Cortez and Arto Lindsay, brings together 26 artists, many of them the usual suspects, like Edward Ruscha, Brice Marden and Philip Taaffe, all intersecting with the show's theme from different angles and tangents. Richard Prince for example, contributes a joke painting about a funeral.   Included are \"Jawbone,\" a powerful, uncharacteristically wordless painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat, and an exceptional four-panel painting by Francesco Clemente in which a seemingly living face is progressively readied for burial, winding up dead. But the show's main action is sculptural: impressive objects by Louise Bourgeois, Kiki Smith, Matthew Barney and, most startlingly, a Brazilian Candomble priest named Mestre Didi, create a garden of earthly delights centerstage. (Through March 19.) Jay Gorney    The exhibition at Jay Gorney (100 Greene Street, near Prince Street) includes works by the painter David Deutsch, the photographer James Welling and Douglas Blau, a critic, curator and expert image-gatherer who is giving appropriation art a few new twists. Mr. Deutsch's painting of a small town glimpsed through the lush overgrowth of summer trees plays off the starker realities of Mr. Welling's black-and-white photographs of old houses whose weathered exteriors and hillside settings immediately evoke the harshness of mining-town life.   In the other direction, Mr. Deutsch's \"Double Plaza\" and \"Repository,\" in which pantheons of blurry portraits invoke a rather daunting sense of cultural authority, are relieved by Mr. Blau's \"Views and Vistas.\" This work of 81 found images from sources high and low and ranging through several centuries, concentrates on isolated figures seen from the back, looking at landscapes. After Mr. Deutsch's generic evocations of human achievement, it's nice to see man and woman dwarfed by nature. (Through March 26.) Postmasters    \"Untitled,\" the group show at Postmasters (80 Greene Street, near Spring Street), presents work by five women and reminds us that, contrary to the impression created by the current exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, abstract artists, too, can be \"Bad Girls.\" All it takes is irreverence, a certain raunchiness of style or material and a healthy disregard for the lines between media. Beth Haggart constructs a huge, truculent yet buoyant sphere from cardboard boxes, while Polly Apfelbaum states the colors of the spectrum in radiant terms on strips of white velvet arranged neatly on the floor.   In an especially beautiful work that recalls the early 1970's poured-latex paintings of Lynda Benglis, Lauren Szold creates an in-progress piece of Process Art by swirling color across the floor and letting it drip from the ceiling. Nancy Rubins's rugged graphite drawings and Jessica Stockholder's bristling found-object formalism complete this impressive gathering. (Through March 19.) P.P.O.W.    \"Arabesque,\" at P.P.O.W. (532 Broadway, near Spring Street), follows the curving, undulating and occasionally curlicue lines of arabesques from artwork to artwork, which are good, bad and indifferent and mostly paintings. It gets credit for emphasizing the decorative in art of all kinds, be it the political surrealism of Frank Moore's painting \"Easter,\" with its spiral of blood, or the intimate heraldic shapes of David Moreno's untitled abstract collage.   In Lari Pittman's ferociously decorative \"Untitled No. 4 (Insist),\" the decorative and the political fuse seamlessly. Also engaging are the works of Betsy Friedman, Amy Sillman, Fred Tomaselli, Gregory Crane and Peter Nagy, who has abandoned his black and white palette for pastels. And the overall ambiance of this show -- bright, formally exuberant and, well, a little loopy -- is a pleasant change of pace. (Through March 19.) Lennon, Weinberg    \"An Exhibition in Memory of Raoul Hague,\" at Lennon, Weinberg (580 Broadway, near Prince Street), is a touching meditation on the artist's quest. It brings together six sculptures by Raoul Hague, who died last year at the age of 88, with three or four drawings or paintings each by Arshile Gorky, Bradley Walker Tomlin and Philip Guston, all of whom Hague claimed as friends and inspirers. Each artist's progress toward abstraction and an individual style is briefly indicated, starting with Tomlin's \"Tulip,\" a lovely little painting from 1930, and ending with Guston's lumpily sensuous \"Afternoon II\" of 1963.   Especially noteworthy is Hague's \"Belgian Marble,\" a 1940 sculpture of a standing female nude whose simplified forms reflect the artist's studies with William Zorach and John Flannagan. The figure's face is awkwardly schematized and its arms are poorly resolved, but the abbreviated yet gently swelling torso achieves a balance between the real and the abstract and between flesh and stone that is completely riveting. (Through tomorrow.) Thread Waxing Space    In \"Don't Look Now\" at Thread Waxing Space (476 Broadway, near Broome Street), the critic Joshua Decter creates a picture gallery that is also a slide show. In the process he demonstrates the appeal that strictly limited formats hold for curators. Mr. Decter invited 68 artists (and a few writers) to submit any work they wanted so long as it was in slide form. All are projected high on the walls of a dark narrow space, in alphabetical order.   Some artists simply sent slides of their work. Others, like Jon Kessler, who turned his slide into a work of kinetic art, have bent the format to their particular sensibilities. For some, no bending was necessary. The self-absorbed Sean Landers sent a childhood photograph, while Robert Gober is represented by a slide of an early painting from a work that consists entirely of slides of no-longer-extant early paintings. This show may be a critic's revenge on the art object, or an aside about art in the age of mechanical reproduction. But it's also great fun, perhaps in spite of itself. (Through tomorrow.) Galerie St. Etienne    Not all the artists in \"The Forgotten Folk Art of the 1940's,\" at Galerie St. Etienne (24 West 57th Street), deserve to be remembered. It doesn't seem necessary, for example, to retrieve from obscurity the sentimental, heavy-handed canvases of Abraham Levin or Lawrence Lebduska, although the latter comported himself quite well when painting fish and cactuses on small wood panels. The show is further weakened by poor examples of artists who aren't all that forgotten, like John Kane; and by so many similar snow scenes by Grandma Moses that the term cottage industry gains new meaning.   Still, it's great to see Israel Litwak's dense little landscapes in which careful patterns make every leaf and flower stand out. Also worthy of rediscovery are the paintings of Grandma Moses' younger brother, Fred Robertson, who took up the brush after his sister's success. Sibling rivalry is clearly as effective as any other artistic motivation: at least in this context, Robertson's less meticulous, more emotional landscapes and farm scenes outshine the efforts of his famous sister. (Through March 19.)  Barbara Mathes    The twain that meet in \"Alternative Visions\" at the Barbara Mathes Gallery (41 East 57th Street) are 19th-century French wallpaper and 20th-century Minimal Art, realms of artistic endeavor so disparate that one doesn't even think of them as opposites.   The meeting is more a miss than a hit, partly because many visitors to contemporary art galleries may find the wallpaper designs so unfamiliar and striking, especially in their unusual, often intense color combinations, that the efforts of Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Robert Ryman and Carl Andre may simply be overlooked. There's shared territory: an emphasis on repeating forms and at times a chalky surface delicacy. But the show's only real click is the juxtaposition of three scenic panels and a stripe painting by Agnes Martin, which share a similar grisaille color scheme and sense of restraint. Otherwise, it's a nice try, with the wallpaper doing most of the work. (Through April 2.)

More important, the actress moves quickly past the moment and stays in character, half-trying to seduce the young man while plotting jewel heists in this quirky dark comedy (made in 1991 and never before shown in the United States).

Earlier in the night, friends had joined him to watch sports highlights on television.   He had gone 4 for 5 with two homers, 4 runs scored and 4 runs batted in in the game against the Phillies. All those numbers represented career highs for Bogar, who was trying to prove to the Mets that he just might cut it as the team's starting shortstop, rather than as the utility infielder they had pegged him to be. Big Opportunity Wasted    But Bogar made a stupid mistake. On his last at-bat he hit an inside-the-park homer and slid head first into the plate. His left hand twisted, the ligaments tore and suddenly his season was over on Aug. 15, his big opportunity wasted away.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940225","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/25/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Gaston Sigur, head of the Sigur Center for East Asian Studies in Washington,D.C. is reading,\"The Devaluing of America\" by William J.

He discovered the quintet sound that made him famous while recording \"September in the Rain\" on Feb. 17, 1948; it featured vibraharp (Margie Hyams), guitar (Chuck Wayne) and Shearing's adaptation of Milt Buckner's locked-hand piano style, in which the two hands, closely aligned, span an octave. Mr. Shearing finally escaped this sound in 1978 by dropping the quintet and forming a duo with Neil Swainson on bass. The duo shares this weekend's program with Kenny Burrell's Trio, in which Mr. Burrell joined by the bassist Marcus McLaurine and the drummer Sherman Ferguson.

He was at his imaginative best in \"Clave,\" a piece created in 1991 that is both a solo and more than a solo. The title comes from the name of a wooden stick or block that can be used as a percussion instrument. Appropriately, a recording of Steve Reich's \"Music for Pieces of Wood\" serves as the accompaniment.   By Mr. Feld's design, the score's ceaseless clackings set Buffy Miller's wrists flicking and shoulders shaking. His choreographic responses to the music were fascinatingly varied.

Now, 14 days later, she was cradling the sleeping infant to her breast and talking of the loss of her man and the glory of her child.   \"Have I cried?\" said the woman in her basement apartment in Woodhaven, Queens. \"No, not much. In the last two months of my pregnancy I knew I had to concentrate on keeping calm. I didn't want to pass any nervousness on to the baby. I had to be strong so she wouldn't be colicky or troubled.\"   Her daughter, Bianca Alexis, slept peacefully beneath a tapestry of Marilyn Monroe. She has a well-formed face with thick brown hair that has a little red in it, like her mother's. If she grows up to look like her mother she will be a beautiful woman. \"She has her daddy's lips,\" Ms. Gonzalez said, pointing to the photograph of Alexander Ortiz, the man who was shot as they walked back to this apartment from the movies on Nov. 26, three days before his 23d birthday.   She has not repressed the details of what happened that night. She remembers the two men coming toward them. The shot that knocked Alex down. The second shot as she fumbled with buttons to remove her three-year-old shearling coat. She remembers how after the killers fled into a white car, Alex, bleeding on the sidewalk, had told her he was scared. \"I told him to pray and he said he didn't know how. He hadn't been raised in church. I hugged him and prayed.\"      She also remembers how some police officers and some friends and relatives had assumed the gunmen were black. \"Why did they say that? The killers were my own kind. They were Spanish. You know there's plenty of bad in all kinds of people.\" Several times since then she has been at the spot where Alex was killed. It is a shopping area and it is hard to avoid, but in any case, going there did not fill her with dread. \"I am not scared living here. This is not a bad neighborhood. What happened could have happened anywhere from Park Avenue to Florida.\"    She has written down her memories in a letter she plans to give her daughter on her 16th birthday. She wrote how in the seventh month of pregnancy she had gone to the hospital to identify Alex. How she had hugged his body there and later in the morgue. She described how she went home and did his laundry, laying out socks and underwear in drawers where they still remain.   Sometimes, as she waited for birth, she wore his underwear. In the letter she told of her gratefulness to friends, relatives and strangers who offered support. After the funeral she used money sent to her to outfit Bianca's room and decorate it with Mickeys and Minnies and Donalds.    \"I've written everything I could for her,\" said Ms. Gonzalez, 23, who had worked as an executive secretary. \"Mostly about Alex, both the good and the bad.\"   With great joy she recalled her romance with a man who had been unlike any other she had known, a man younger than herself, a man with a prison record, a Bronx tough guy raised mostly on the streets.   They had met at Orchard Beach. \"I remember when I met him I thought men were slime. I had gone out with men with good careers, with prospects. But I wasn't interested in settling down. I didn't want children. I had a good job. I liked traveling. I guess I was a flirt. Then I met Alex and in one day it all changed.\"   Alex was starting to change as well. Under her influence, he enrolled in a course on computer programming. He found a job. He learned to drive and bought a car. \"When I would come to visit him in the Bronx after work, wearing my business suits, it made him so proud. He thought of himself as an uptown man and I was his downtown woman.\"   They went to Cancun together. They took the apartment near where she grew up in Woodhaven and they talked of one day having a house on Long Island. Ms. Gonzalez's parents, at first troubled by the young man, started to see in him some of what their daughter saw.     \"We decided to have a baby,\" she said. \"Bianca was no accident. We talked about it and Alex wanted me to have his child. He really wanted a girl. We stopped using protection and we decided on the name. Now he's gone but she is here and when I look at her I see him. Would my life be better if he had lived and I never had her? There were things about him that hurt me to know, including things I found out after he died, but I loved him and he loved me. I am religious. I went to Catholic schools and I really believe that what happened was meant to be.\"   \"If you measure life in years, you could think I was shortchanged. But if you look at it as experience or the intensity of experience, the year and a half Alex and I were together were complete. There was nothing missing. Everything we did was right and now there is Bianca.\" Lovingly, zestfully, and with more grace of spirit than you might expect to find in someone of her age, she placed the sleeping girl in her crib.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940226","headline":"Review/Music; Orchestra Shows Off Its Ellington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/26/arts/review-music-orchestra-shows-off-its-ellington.html","abstract":"  Jazz performances can start in all sorts of ways, and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra opened its show at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night burning.

First published in Polish in 1990, the book was edited by Teresa Swiebocka, a senior curator at the museum, with the English edition prepared by Jonathan Webber, who teaches social anthropology at Oxford University, and Connie Wilsack, the managing editor of the Littman Library of Jewish Civilization in Oxford. Auschwitz, the largest Nazi concentration camp, was established in occupied Poland in 1940. More than a million Jews perished there, along with 120,000 Poles, Gypsies, Soviet prisoners of war, Yugoslavs and homosexuals. They died from starvation, disease, torture, hard labor and executions by shooting, hanging or gassing. When the camp was liberated by the Soviet Army in January 1945, there were 7,000 survivors. The horrifying photographs in this book depict gas chambers, barracks and crematoriums, as well as prisoners, dead bodies, arms tattooed with prison numbers and piles of teeth, glasses, human hair and artificial limbs. Most stunning is the juxtaposition of photographs with the reproductions of drawings and paintings by former prisoners, some actually done in the camp. The drawings and paintings are as intensely detailed as the photographs. \"The works represented here spell out an accusation,\" writes Kazimierz Smolen, a survivor of Auschwitz and former director of its museum. \"Each brushstroke and pencil mark is a condemnation of the Nazi system.\" Elsewhere, he writes: \"We remember as part of our homage to the victims. If we fail to remember, then their suffering and death will have no meaning: history will be incomplete.\" SUSAN SHAPIRO","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"The Mighty Nell's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/style/the-mighty-nell-s.html","abstract":"  Perched on a red leather banquette, squeezed behind a hand-painted cafe table in the nightclub named after her, Laura (Nell) Campbell raised her arms and waved them from side to side.   \"This is what I've heard they do,\" she said, \"those rave people.

They believe that by smoking they are joining \"The Five S Club\" of the \"slim, sexy, sociable, sophisticated and successful.\" In truth, they are joining a far more lethal organization -- one that will reward many of them, in time, with respiratory ailments, heart disease and lung cancer.   Dr. Elders blamed the tobacco industry's advertising for making smoking so seductive to teen-agers; a spokesman for the industry promptly denied trying to recruit the young. But with so many adults quitting, where can the industry go for new customers but to youth? And who does the R. J. Reynolds Company think it is kidding with its Joe Camel -- and now Josephine Camel -- ads?   R. J. Reynolds has said they were designed for adults, but studies published in 1991 in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed that the ads reached children more successfully than they did adults, and that 6-year-olds were as familiar with Joe as they were with Mickey Mouse.   Millions of Americans -- those who have stopped smoking and those who haven't -- know how hard it is to kick the habit. For half of them it is a habit acquired before they were 14 years old.   Dr. Elders, like surgeons general before her, is wise to use her bully pulpit to talk about smoking and its consequences.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"In Search of a Buzz","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/books/l-in-search-of-a-buzz-284688.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As the marketing director at Alfred A.

But city officials said they hope that their strategies would work together with new Federal handgun purchasing regulations to stem the influx of weapons from states like Ohio and Georgia, which have weak or nonexistent local gun controls.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"Christopher Hears Demands Of 2 Warring Bosnia Sides","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/world/christopher-hears-demands-of-2-warring-bosnia-sides.html","abstract":"  For the first time in the 22-month war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Secretary of State Warren Christopher sat down with two of the three warring sides today to hear their demands and offer new ideas in an effort to find a formula for peace.

The panel invited artists and architects to submit proposals and received 170 from around the world. Four co-winners, along with 36 other entries, are on view in the exhibition \"Reclaiming Our Past, Honoring Our Ancestors\" at the Municipal Art Society, 457 Madison Avenue at 51st Street, through April 20. The show then moves to Washington. The coalition is seeking Federal funds to build a memorial that would incorporate the winners' ideas. Here is a look at them. MARVINE HOWE WHAT: \"A Wall of Persistent Acknowledgement,\" a five-story glass wall with 20,000 brass pins symbolizing shroud pins found in the burial ground.   BY: Lester Y. Yuen and Nana D. Last, architects in Cambridge, Mass.   WHY: \"Each pin will be two feet long and have the words African-American and a number on its head, as a visible presence of the estimated 20,000 black people concealed by the construction of the city,\" Mr. Yuen explained.  WHAT: \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" a seven-story stone wall engraved with Paul Lawrence Dunbar's poem \"Sympathy\" and, on a stone-paved plaza, a 180-foot-high obelisk, copper palisades and a reflecting pool with African masks in it.   BY: J. Timothy Richard, Katharine E.M. Brendle and Robert L. Brendle, architectural designers in Portland, Ore.   WHY: \"We tried to create a monumental space, inspired by indigenous African forms,\" Mr. Richard said. WHAT: \"Walking Among African Graves, Speaking Through the Ground,\" a sidewalk mosaic with texts, provided by organizations and individuals, honoring the dead.    BY: Karen Bermann, architecture teacher at Iowa State University, and Jeanine Centuori, assistant professor of Architectural Theory and Design at Kent State University.   WHY: \"We wanted to remind people this site is not only today's commercial zone but also a graveyard and, according to Africans, a sacred space,\" Ms. Bermann said.  WHAT: \"53 Elevators,\" a metal plaque with the words \"You are now suspended above the African Burial Ground,\" which would be placed in all the elevators in the eight buildings within the four-block area covered by the original cemetery.    BY: Chris Neville, graduate student in Historic Preservation at Columbia University.   WHY: \"This is the simplest approach to weave the significance of the site into the day-to-day lives of the thousands of office workers in the area,\" Mr. Neville said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"Career Mothers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/books/l-career-mothers-284734.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I am responding to Alice Kessler-Harris's review of \"Working Women Don't Have Wives,\" by Terri Apter, and \"Women Lawyers,\" by Mona Harrington (Jan. 30).

The plans call for a new $450 million incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to handle 3,000 tons a day and for upgrading an unused, smaller plant in Bensonhurst.

Calistoga is a funky town with an annual mustard festival and eight spas and resorts, making it one of the best-known places in the region to get a quick relaxation fix.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"Revolt of the Animals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/books/revolt-of-the-animals.html","abstract":"DOGS\nBy Robin Wallace-Crabbe.\n236 pp. New York:\nAngus & Robertson/\nHarperCollins Publishers.\nPaper, $12.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"Molding Is Useful, but Mounting It May Need Practice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/nyregion/home-clinic-molding-is-useful-but-mounting-it-may-need-practice.html","abstract":"  ADDING molding can change a room as dramatically as painting or wallpapering. Molding shapes, or profiles, can help define the character of a room. The placement of molding can create, alter or emphasize reference points.   It helps to see a display of installed molding rather than small samples, but the samples are useful for understanding how moldings can be combined to produce an overall design. An example is baseboard molding in which three or more strips are often layered to produce the complete profile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940227","headline":". . .

The litany of Ms. Breibart's distortions is too long for this rebuttal. It is important to note, however, that she, who claims that the name can't be registered, tried to purchase it for herself just before I did. Clearly, this inconsistency in her claim, as well as others, gives rise to natural speculation about her motives in attacking my legitimate ownership.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940227","headline":"A Yankee Is Facing Catch-22","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/sports/baseball-a-yankee-is-facing-catch-22.html","abstract":"  If Joseph Heller had not invented the phrase \"Catch-22,\" some frustrated young baseball player might have.
