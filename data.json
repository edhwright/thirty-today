Robert J. Kamrowski, the hospital aide, who the two men took hostage at the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in Orange County, apparently left on a 14-day vacation the next morning. Police officials interviewed Mr. Kamrowski on Friday night but said they wanted to re-interview him because there were elements in his account that investigators did not understand.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Democrats Pick New York Slate Of Incumbents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/us/democrats-pick-new-york-slate-of-incumbents.html","abstract":"  Girding for a challenge from newly unified Republicans, New York's Democrats smoothly blessed a ticketful of incumbents for re-election at their state convention today, beginning with unanimous endorsements of Gov.

There are many reasons for this good news: public-service campaigns promoting sensible drinking and designated drivers; major lawsuits that have caused bartenders to think twice about serving intoxicated customers; society's growing distaste for public drunkenness. Yet the deaths of three pedestrians in New York City this spring at the hands of a man with a long history of drunken driving, Abraham Meyers, was a dramatic reminder that we have a long way to go.    The killings provoked justifiable, widespread outrage over lax laws and meager enforcement. Yet few mentioned that the accident might have been averted through simple technology. In a few feet, a car can transform a driver's failings -- drunkenness, anger, momentary inattention -- into a body count. Since cars are essential to everyday life, they cannot be banned, but they can be engineered to keep drunks from getting behind the wheel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Veto Delayed By Giuliani On Job Shift","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/nyregion/veto-delayed-by-giuliani-on-job-shift.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

But as usual, Holly Hynes did wonders with her variations on leotards and tunics, and Mark Stanley excelled again with ingenious lighting that provided a fresh theatrical context at the New York State Theater for each work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Salvador Rightist Inaugurated, Pledging to Fulfill Treaty","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/world/salvador-rightist-inaugurated-pledging-to-fulfill-treaty.html","abstract":"  Armando Calderon Sol took office as President today, leading a right-wing Government that has pledged to complete the political changes promised to end the 10-year civil war.

Though the budget fight is now the second longest in more than a decade, it is unclear what impact the delay has had on cities, towns and school districts that depend on state aid. Thanks to $5.5 billion in emergency appropriations from the Legislature over the last two weeks, there has apparently been little borrowing and few layoffs or delays in public projects or in meeting payrolls.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Germany Opts to Redo Old Ministries in Berlin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/world/germany-opts-to-redo-old-ministries-in-berlin.html","abstract":"  Criticized for trying to upholster its long-delayed move to the national capital in Berlin, the German Government said today it had decided to save $600 million by moving into spartan, existing buildings rather than try to complete comfortable new ones by the target date, the year 2000.   The Berlin city government has been pleading with the German federal Government to get the move underway before foreign investors and swarms of lobbyists who have already bought up prime real estate around Berlin give up and leave.

Common sense, and the wise counsel of political figures as diverse as former Mayor Edward Koch and the City Council member Ronnie Eldridge say that $100 million is too low a price for half the Coliseum site that was once going to bring $338 million. Deputy Mayor John Dyson's plan to keep Mr. Zuckerman's cost to $80 million by having the city contribute $20 million is simply unconscionable and undermines Mr. Dyson as a trustworthy steward of public money.   Mr. Giuliani does not have to tie himself to Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Dyson. As of last night, Mr. Zuckerman had not formally accepted the offer. Mr. Giuliani is not one to accept advice when he has gotten the bit in his teeth. But he would be smart to snatch the paper back before Mr. Zuckerman can sign it. Otherwise, this deal will go into the history books as a signal error of Mr. Giuliani's first year and one that will permanently damage his reputation for judgment and probity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Rockets Go On Retreat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/sports/pro-basketball-rockets-go-on-retreat.html","abstract":"  The Rockets head south to Galveston Thursday morning.

Although the milieu invoked in this exhibition has evolved since Wharton's day, the struggle laid out in these rooms remains vivid and compelling in the way that the story of rebellion often does. It was once said of Edith Wharton and her friend Theodore Roosevelt that that they were both self-made. This is the true subject at the National Academy: how Edith Wharton, born into Old New York of the 1860's and raised in it during the 1870's and 1880's, found her way out of it -- and fully into her own life -- by the first decade of this century.\n\nTo the argument that the Wharton career has been too ubiquitous of late (\"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Ethan Frome\" filmed; her last unfinished novel, \"The Buccaneers,\" completed and published; the woman herself impersonated onstage by Irene Worth), the answer is that here, refreshingly, is a collection of iconography contemporary to Wharton's actual New York.

That sudden five-foot drop in the middle of the lawn of this Sussex country estate was designed to keep sheep from grazing up to the manor house. Although the term is old, one local wit suggested that it derives from the number of tuxedoed gentlemen and silk-gowned ladies who have tripped on it during the 80-minute intermissions that are a feature of the Glyndebourne Festival.   No one tripped on Wednesday night, when the festival opened with a production of Mozart's \"Nozze di Figaro,\" but the ha-ha seems to have reproduced. After 60 years of presenting renowned opera performances in a quaint room originally built to hold only 300 people, Glyndebourne has an imposing new theater that seats 1,200 and cost $49.5 million. And for anyone who has ever strolled around Glyndebourne, there is now one surprise after another. Open a door in the organ room that used to lead to the old theater and you are faced with a cinderblock wall. Take a turn that once led through a narrow passage between ramshackle buildings that have accrued over centuries, and you find yourself heading toward an expanded souvenir shop with Glyndebourne-labeled offerings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940603","headline":"Review/Film; DeVito Gets Lessons From Soldier Students","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/movies/review-film-devito-gets-lessons-from-soldier-students.html","abstract":"Adman educates iffy Army recruits.

The saxophonist Illinois Jacquet first became a jazz headliner when he was a sideman in big bands like Cab Calloway's, Lionel Hampton's and, in the 1940's, Count Basie's last band. When he turned to leading his own group, he used a small combo, a format that lasted more than 30 years. But in the 1980's he became the last of the Swing Era stars to form his own big band. Lacking the locations that existed in the big bands' heyday, even such great survivors as the Duke Ellington and Count Basie Bands had been reduced by then to playing one-night stands. But the Jacquet band has now embarked on an unusual engagement: a five-week run at Tavern on the Green. The band plays tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11 P.M. and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. It will continue at the Tavern through July 3. The music charge is $23.50 on Fridays and Saturdays, or $17.50 on Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. JOHN S.

So the John Bunch Trio features Bucky Pizzarelli on guitar, and the Bucky Pizzarelli Trio features John Bunch on piano. But when they enlarge, they become the New York Swing Quartet, this weekend with Bob Haggart, the bassist who was one of the stars of the Bob Crosby Band in the 1930's and 40's, and the drummer Dennis Mackrel, a veteran of Count Basie's last band. They play three shows tonight and tomorrow, at 8 and 10 P.M. and midnight, and two shows on Sunday, at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $20 cover charge and a $10 minimum all three nights. J. S.

Those huge, warehouse-type discount stores are increasingly popular around the country, but New York City has relatively few because of zoning restrictions that go back to 1974. Now the Giuliani administration, like the Dinkins administration before it, is considering revising the zoning rules. That would be a sound move if city officials take pains to protect small neighborhood stores that contribute to the vitality of life throughout the five boroughs.   There is ample evidence that the absence of superstores hurts the tax base and creates a drain on the general economy. Many shoppers in search of bargains go to Nassau, New Jersey and Westchester.

This was bracing compensation for the middling performance of Mozart's \"Nozze di Figaro\" that opened the hallon Wednesday evening.   In fact, \"Onegin\" received precisely the kind of staging and performance that made Glyndebourne's worldwide reputation. Graham Vick, the festival's director of productions, revealed an almost Classical refinement under the surface of this Romantic opera. Its tale of thwarted love unfolded through a series of spare, eloquently sung scenes. Onegin's first-act rejection of Tatyana, for example, was mirrored by Tatyana's third-act rejection of Onegin: in each scene, both characters sat in chairs on opposite corners of a nearly bare stage. Also, each act was clearly divided into a public scene of festive celebration and a private scene of confrontation and confession. Andrew Davis's conducting of the London Philharmonic, along with an ensemble of striking singers, gave passion and flesh to the director's formalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940604","headline":"1944: Embassy Shelter?: IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/04/opinion/IHT-1944-embassy-shelter-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"MADRID - [From our New York edition:] Reports from Vichy said tonight [June 3] that Chief of Government Pierre Leval has ordered confiscation of the American Embassy building at Paris to provide shelter for bombed-out French families.
