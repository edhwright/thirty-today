The muscular, bearded man, who called himself Emad Salem, acted as an occasional translator and bodyguard for the sheik and made himself available to reporters after the bombing of the World Trade Center in February. Last week, when the cleric called a news conference in Jersey City to denounce the Egyptian Government, Mr. Salem frisked reporters, and Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, who the authorities say is the leader of the bomb plot, translated from Arabic to English. Central to Arrests    The authorities said Mr. Salem was central to the arrests of the accused plotters, luring them to make statements that were recorded, helping to test explosives and even renting the house in Jamaica, Queens, where the suspects are accused of mixing the fertilizer and fuel for bombs.

Wind gusting to 20 miles an hour yesterday afternoon kept later starters from making a strong run at Pavin, who completed 36 holes at 132, eight-under for two rounds over the 6,280-yard Tournament Players Club at River Highlands. Keith Clearwater shot 68 to gain a share of second place at 134 with Mike Springer. The first-round co-leaders, Roger Maltbie and Craig Stadler, had wind problems, each shooting 71 to drop to four-under.

(AP) Thunderstorm Halts Senior Players Championship: Jim Colbert and Rocky Thompson were in the clubhouse at 5-under-par 139 when a thunderstorm halted yesterday's second round of the Senior Players Championship in Dearborn, Mich. Thompson shot a one-under 71 and Colbert matched par at 72. An inch of rain fell in an hour on the TPC of Michigan golf course, and two hours later officials decided they couldn't get the bunkers into playable condition in time to complete the second round. Thirty-nine players, half the field, faced a restart early this morning to complete the second round. When the horn sounded to halt play, first-round co-leader Jim Albus was six-under after 13 holes and Bob Charles, the other first-round leader, was four-under after 12 holes.

In New Jersey, Republicans in the State Assembly fancied that a cut in the personal income tax this year would put Gov. Jim Florio on the spot and, of course, enhance their own popularity. But the politically astute Governor has pulled a fast one and also lobbied for a tax cut -- not as big as the G.O.P.'s, but still a cut.   A scorecard may help here: Governor Florio, a Democrat, is seeking a second term. But the huge tax increase he pushed through the then-Democratic Legislature three years ago was so unpopular that a year later the Republicans won veto-proof majorities in both houses. Thus chastened, Mr. Florio is unlikely to force another showdown on taxes anytime soon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930626","headline":"The Nomads of Albany","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/opinion/the-nomads-of-albany.html","abstract":"  Talk about party animals.

With elegiac tunes that are close to hymns and marches, the songs from \"Us\" (Geffen), Mr. Gabriel's current album, mourn the end of a love affair, trying to find solace and some reason to hope. Such material isn't unprecedented as big-budget pop spectacle; Pink Floyd and the Pet Shop Boys have both staged their own dark ruminations for mass audiences.

Ms. Rimland, a 45-year-old matrimonial lawyer, took her own life and that of her daughter around midnight on June 15 by running the car engine inside her garage after looping a rubber hose from the tailpipe into the car window. In a note she left behind she said she could no longer abide her husband's sexual abuse of her daughter, even though a court had found no substance to that charge.  Groping for Answers    Ms. Rimland's awful act has left those who knew her groping for an explanation. Her husband's friends paint her as an unstable, ruthless woman who would stop at nothing to keep him from their daughter.  But her many champions describe her as a loving mother who despaired of any other means of protecting her child.    The mother was buried by a Reform rabbi under a searing sun in a cemetery in Elmont, L.I. Her two children from an earlier marriage, Jason Rimland, 23, and Marisa Rimland, 19, leaned against each other sobbing inconsolably. An outpouring of mourners proclaimed her death another injustice of a family court system that had permitted the father, Arie Adler, to resume unsupervised visits.    Abigail, a bubbly girl who loved to sing and dance to Disney songs, was laid to rest after sundown in a small cemetery in Monsey, N.Y., that belongs to the largely Hasidic community to which her father had begun to cleave. Car headlights had to illuminate the grave so that mourners could aim their fistfuls of dirt. Jason and Marisa were there, even though Mr. Adler had won the battle to bury Abigail in a cemetery of his choosing.   The separate funerals were the culmination of a two-year custody fight that has not died even with Abigail's death. It shows how fierce and irrational battles over children can get, and how difficult it is for Family Courts to sort out the truth.   The case has galvanized several groups that feel Family Court judges are biased against women, insensitive to sexual abuse and overly secretive and insular. However, the father's defenders see it as another example of a national hysteria over child abuse that has led to fabrication of destructive charges in a blind fury over other grievances.    But overriding any ideological issues were the consuming passions of the parents, whose bitterness lives on in their survivors. Jason and Marisa originally wanted their mother and half sister cremated, but the Orthodox community, which opposes cremation, sent a Hatzolah ambulance worker to the coroner's officer to safeguard Abigail's body. Jason and Marisa have already cleaned out Abigail's toys and dolls from her room in a large ranch house here to keep them from the father.   \"The family doesn't let the living live in peace and it doesn't let the dead die in peace,\" said Anne Selinger, who put Mr. Adler up in her family's home. Extreme Visions    The story of Abigail's parents, like that of many custody fights, is woven of extreme visions. Her family and supporters see Marcia Rimland as a strong, devoted mother who snuffed out her daughter's life when she felt she had no other way to protect her. As a lawyer, Marisa said, her mother knew that appealing the Family Court decision could take a year, during which visits she considered inadequately supervised would continue.   \"She would rather Abigail not be there than to have Abigail hurt,\" Marisa said. \"She loved her more than life.\"   \"She felt cornered,\" said her sister-in-law, Deanna Rimland. \"She felt she had no more options.\"    But Mrs. Selinger and leaders of the Orthodox community around Monsey see her as an unstable, calculating and litigious woman who was so obsessed with excluding her husband that she was willing to brainwash Abigail into believing she was being molested.    According to Mrs. Selinger, Ms. Rimland had always kept her children apart from her estranged husbands. For many years, Mrs. Selinger said, Ms. Rimland had influenced Marisa and Jason to shun their father, Leonard Cohen, who died in January. Similarly, Ms. Selinger said, she made sure Arie Adler would never see Abigail.   \"She couldn't do it through the court system so she did it by taking her life and her daughter's life,\" Mrs. Selinger said.    Views of the 38-year-old Mr. Adler are similarly stark. Mrs. Selinger sees only an affectionate father who tried to protect a daughter who cherished him against a ruthless wife. But the Rimland supporters condemn him as a cold, selfish man who inspired tantrums of fear in his helpless daughter and took advantage of her.   Mr. Adler's lawyer, Howard M. Gurock, denies that his client ever abused Abigail and accuses the mothert of brainwashing the child into making the charges.    The final act was played out swiftly. On June 14, Judge William P. Warren of Family Court in Rockland ruled that the preponderance of evidence did not indicate that Mr. Adler had abused his daughter. A court-appointed social worker had testified that Abigail's \"presentation is entirely consistent with that of a sexually abused child.\" But other witnesses found significant inconsistencies, and Mr. Adler's Lubavitcher hosts, Mrs. Selinger and her husband, Craig, said they had seen only a warm relationship whenever father and daughter stayed over.   The judge, concluding that the tales of abuse were the result of prompting by the mother, ordered a resumption of unsupervised visits in two days. Desperate, Ms. Adler drove to the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on Tuesday and won what some felt was a concession. The Selingers would supervise the visits. But Ms. Rimland felt that the Selingers were too close to her estranged husband.   That night she wrote a note to her older children on a piece of memo paper and led her daughter to her red Toyota.   \"You are my children and I love you more than myself,\" said the note that Jason found in the car. \"Abigail is also my child. I cannot knowingly allow her to be sexually abused. I have no choice. I hope you understand. Be kind to each other. I'm sorry I have to leave you alone. Love forever. Mom.\" Met Six Years Ago    Marcia and Arie met at a party six years ago. He was a broad-shouldered Israeli immigrant with gold-rimmed glasses who was studying electrical engineering. She was a small, slender woman with intense eyes who had been raised as a furrier's daughter in the Bronx. She had two teen-age children from an unhappy first marriage and was fashioning a career as a lawyer.   They married in September 1988, but quarreled regularly, particularly with the arrival of Abigail on June 3, 1989. Their disputes turned so violent that the police were called more than half a dozen times. By August 1991, Mr. Adler moved out, eventually living as a boarder in Hasidic homes, and Ms. Rimland sued for divorce.   One issue dividing them was Abigail's religious upbringing. Ms. Rimland disregarded most Jewish observance, but Mr. Adler, who once had been willing to work on Yom Kippur, began following the Orthodox path of colleagues at International Business Machines who gave him rides to work, though he did not adhere to any particular sect.    He wanted his daughter, who called him Abba, the Hebrew word for father, to eat kosher food and he forbade any phone calls on the Sabbath.   \"He fills her head with Chasidic dogma,\" Ms. Rimland wrote in one of several briefs she filed as her own lawyer. Sole Custody to the Mother    Judge Warren awarded Ms. Rimland sole custody in April 1992. He did not give credence to Ms. Rimland's warnings that Mr. Adler was planning to abduct Abigail to Israel and he permitted Abigail to stay with Mr. Adler every other weekend. Mr. Adler never fled to Israel, but he did fail to make support payments and was jailed for 31 days last year.    Mrs. Selinger blamed his incarceration on Ms. Rimland's excessive demands for money, which, she said, had impoverished Mr. Adler.   In September 1992, Ms. Rimland filed a brief that described what she charged was a pattern of sexual abuse. She said she began to notice that her daughter became hysterical whenever she was dropped off for an overnight visit.    \"She would scream and hold on to me so tight that I literally would have to pry her arms and legs from me,\" Mr. Rimland wrote, adding that she always encouraged Abigail to go with her father.   She said she also noticed that her daughter's toilet training began to regress and that she often masturbated. Ms. Rimland called this to the attention of officials at the county's Child Protection Services, who wondered whether Abigail was being abused.    That was the first time she suspected that possibility, Ms. Rimland said. So she asked Abigail what her father wore when she slept over. She said Abigail told her he wore nothing but an undershirt and repeatedly touched her genital area.   About the same time last summer, Cherri Varvaro, who ran a home day care center that Abigail attended, took a workshop on abused children and decided that Abigail exhibited the classic behaviors of abuse. She asked Abigail and was told that her father sometimes \"tickled\" her genitals.    Ms. Varvaro alerted Ms. Rimland and Child Protection Services in August. Their complaints led to an investigation by the County Attorney.  During the nine months until his decision, the judge insisted that Abigail's visits with Mr. Adler be supervised.   The judge appointed Dr. Virginia C. Strand, a clinical social worker, to interview Abigail and decide whether abuse had occurred. Dr. Strand reported in November that Abigail \"demonstrated a hypervigilant attitude commonly seen in abused children and/or children who witness domestic violence.\" She said Abigail, with no coaxing, volunteered that her father had penetrated her with his fingers and penis.   But Judge Warren, who has been on the bench five years, said in an interview that he discounted much of Dr. Strand's report because \"Strand never considered the possibility of prompting by the mother.\" Indeed, he said, one of several social workers monitoring the case had asked Abigail whether anyone had told her to say such things about her father and Abigail had replied, \"Mommy told me to say this.\"    \"I did not find the mother credible,\" Judge Warren said.    More convincing to Judge Warren was Mrs. Selinger, the mother of four young daughters and a son, who testified in hearings in February and March that Abigail and Mr. Adler slept in separate beds in a basement playroom and that she saw only affectionate relations. It was the mother whom Abigail did not want to see, Mrs. Selinger testified, describing how Abigail became hysterical when Ms. Rimland phoned.   \"Do you think I as a mother with small children would allow something like this to happen in my house?\" Mrs. Selinger said of the abuse charges.    By the time of the hearings, the custody cases had so consumed Ms. Rimland and Mr. Adler that both lost their jobs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930626","headline":"Bosnian Leader Resists Pressure to Negotiate on Partition Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/world/bosnian-leader-resists-pressure-to-negotiate-on-partition-plan.html","abstract":"  The Serbian-Croatian proposal to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina into three loosely confederated ethnic states continued to be opposed by Bosnia's President today as he faced diplomatic pressure to join seven other members of the collective Bosnian leadership when peace talks resume here next week.

STATEMENT BY LES ASPIN  Secretary of Defense  .  .  .    Tomahawk cruise missiles from the U.S. Navy, from service vessels, were directed at the headquarters building of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. This operation was designed to be a strong and unmistakable response by the United States to the attempt by Iraq to assassinate former President George Bush during his visit to Kuwait in April.   The assassination attempt was not an act of a small group of people acting independently. The evidence is very conclusive that it was the work of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and is an action that would have had to have been approved by the highest levels of Iraqi Government.    After reviewing the evidence, President Clinton ordered the Department of Defense to develop a range of options. The President then selected one of the options, one that would be target -- one that would target directly the agency we believe immediately responsible for planning and conducting this crime. We would put this up here, the chart up here, which gives some of the reasons for picking the headquarters of the I.I.S.    RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORISM The Iraqi Intelligence Service, the I.I.S., is the largest of the Iraqi intelligence agencies. It is responsible for investigating and acting against any suspected disloyalties. It's also responsible for monitoring Iraqi citizens and political activities, and countering dissident Iraqis and opposition groups outside the country.    It is responsible -- the primary agency responsible for terrorist attacks abroad, as it tried to do in this case. The I.I.S. has carried out numerous covert activities, including assassinations, first of Iraqi political dissidents, of defecting scientists, and of Kurdish leaders. It has conducted a terror campaign in Kuwait, car bombings in northern Iraq, and bombing of U.N. relief convoys and attack on U.N. personnel. . .  .   STATEMENT BY GEN. COLIN L. POWELL  Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff    As the Secretary noted, we selected as the target for this evening the Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters. We selected it because it is the closest thing related to the provocation. We're quite confident that they were the ones responsible for the planning of this attempt on President Bush's life, and so we wanted to make sure we had a target that was, shall we say, nexus to the provocation.    PROPORTIONATE RESPONSE We designed the attack in a way that it would be proportionate to the attempt on President Bush's life. The I.I.S. headquarters is responsible for the things noted here, and that Secretary Aspin has spoken to. Located in a restricted area of downtown Baghdad, in a walled installation, it's a facility that was attacked during Desert Storm and has subsequently been rebuilt, reoccupied, and is very actively being used, and as the Secretary noted, conclusively tied to past terrorist operations abroad, and directly related to the planned assassination attempt.  .  .  .   ANSWERS BY MR. ASPIN    Q. What kind of a wake-up call do you think this sends to Saddam Hussein?    A. I mean, if you see the building that was selected, the time of day that was selected, there's a lot of indications as to what the purpose was, and the purpose was to send a very strong message. And the message is that that kind of behavior is just totally unacceptable. .  .  .    SETTING A TARGET What you're trying to do is go after the people responsible. Killing Iraqi people does not go after the people who were responsible for the assassination attempt on George Bush. Going after this building, and the I.I.S., does directly go after the people who were responsible for the attack on George Bush.   Q. On a typical Saturday night how many people might be in the building? And also, is it a favorite haunt of Mr. Hussein himself?   A. No. I think it would be very, very unlikely that Saddam Hussein was there. But there will be people in that building.    Q. How many?   A. I don't know, but it's like any intelligence building. You've got people who are there 24 hours watching communications, you presumably might have some people in there who were involved in maintenance -- clean-up crews or one kind or another. I wouldn't want to guess. . .  .    ANSWERS BY GENERAL POWELL    Q. Was the removal of the carrier from the Persian Gulf -- well now the replacement carrier -- part of the planning process, sort of a feint to lull Saddam Hussein into complacency?   A. No, it was not that deliberate. The carrier is out on its tether; it's available should we want it to come back to the Persian Gulf.    OTHER PRECAUTIONS And we are taking some other precautionary moves to make sure that should Mr. Hussein even dream of retaliating we have more than enough force in the region to deal with it. .  .  .    ANSWERS BY MR. ASPIN    Q. There was thought given at one time -- I thought a decision had been made, actually -- to wait until the Kuwaiti trial had reached its conclusion because of a desire not to interfere with that. Was that just a story?   A. I saw it reported both ways, but what we were waiting for was the conclusive decisions of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.   Q. And in the three things that you or General Powell mentioned, the forensic information, the other two categories, which was the most important and which -- maybe you could go into a little bit more detail about what the nature of the evidence was?   A. I think you need to talk to the people who did it rather than us.   Q. Do you have any indication, any evidence that any of those 23 missiles went astray, did not reach the intended target area?   A. We have no such information.   Q. Are you ruling it out?   A. I can't rule anything out until we have the basis to rule something in or out. I have some preliminary information that a large number of them impacted where they were supposed to; whether they all did or not, we will have wait and get our assessment.   Q. Is there any relation between the recent wave of terrorism in Europe and the arrests in New York and this?   A. I think that again you really do need to talk to the F.B.I. about that. I wouldn't even want to guess.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"Whitney Joy and Scott Cathcart","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/style/weddings-whitney-joy-and-scott-cathcart.html","abstract":"  Whitney Maguire Joy, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James F.

The movie surprised a lot of people, including the critics. It was well directed by Donald Petrie, whose first feature film it was, well acted, and a welcome relief from some of the sludge being pumped out in the name of entertainment. It also made money. It cost $6 million to shoot and in the first six weeks netted more than $9 million. It helped to push Julia Roberts into stardom. It also helped to push the real Mystic Pizza into stardom.

On Friday the Court ruled that an employer could give false explanations for firing a black employee -- yet still prevail in a lawsuit.    Over the years the courts have worked out procedures and burdens of proof that were fair to both employees and employers. A plaintiff's plausible claim of discriminatory firing put the onus on the employer to provide a nonracial reason or lose the case. One would think that a phony or incredible explanation would be worse than none at all. Not according to the 5-to-4 majority.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"Interpreting: a Business Spurred by Diversity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/nyregion/interpreting-a-business-spurred-by-diversity.html","abstract":"  THE increasing ethnic and racial diversity of New Jersey has produced a huge demand for interpreting and translating services in courts, state agencies and corporations, officials and business executives say.

Well, yes. The Four Seasons is anything but the model of Hotel as Teddy Bear. But even though Mr. Pei and his associate architect, Frank Williams, do disdain the current taste for intimate, boutiquey hotels, I would not write off the Four Seasons so quickly. For this 52-story building harks back to the great hotels of New York's past, to the romantic towers of the 1920's and 30's that are still the defining presence of the skyline.

And some of the world's leading mathematicians think he just might have done it. But one would be wise to wait just a bit before declaring victory. Proving this theorem has frustrated the best mathematical minds for more than three and a half centuries; several previous claims withered away under intense scrutiny.   The theorem itself is deceptively simple. Every student is taught in geometry the old formula for linking the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the squares of the other two sides, namely a  + b  = c . But Pierre de Fermat, a 17th century French mathematician, had the insight that the formula would not work for any higher powers. There are no positive whole numbers that will fit the equation a  + b  = c  , or any such formula raised to even higher powers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"The Deadly Sins/Gluttony;\nRemembering Mr. Pinkerton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/books/the-deadly-sinsgluttony-remembering-mr-pinkerton.html","abstract":"A FEW of us meet now and again, not often these days, in the Gran Paradiso or the Cafe Pelican.

In the horse and rider, Marini (1901-80) sensed \"the whole story of humanity and nature at all times.\" Unlike traditional representations of striding steeds and heroic generals, Marini's work depicted toil and tragedy. \"My aim is to render palpable the last stages in the dissolution of a myth, the myth of the heroic and victorious individual,\" the artist once wrote. Likewise, in portraiture, Marini attempted to create \"human documents, stripped of all historical pathos.\" Sam Hunter, a professor of art and archeology at Princeton University, provides a broad overview of Marini's work, reflecting on its Roman and Etruscan influences and on his apprenticeship with the sculptors Arturo Martini and Medardo Rosso. The photographer David Finn has taken several shots of each piece, lingering over them as a visitor's eye might, coming closer to describe a texture, stepping back to appreciate a certain balance. Mr. Hunter appreciates that there is no better articulation of Marini's intentions than the artist's own words, and they are quoted at length, showing the humility and grace of Marini's apocalyptic vision: \"If the whole earth is destroyed in our atomic age, I feel that the human forms which may survive as mere fossils will have become sculptures similar to mine.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"Fugitive Somali Warlord's Rivals Joust for Power","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/world/fugitive-somali-warlord-s-rivals-joust-for-power.html","abstract":"  Since the United Nations unleashed its military campaign against a powerful Somali clan leader, dozens of other factional chiefs have been jockeying for power and pledging cooperation with the peacekeepers in the hope of dominating Somalia's political transition, United Nations and Western officials say.

The Hudson River, the New Jersey skyline and the twisted spines of two large piers are all part of the background against which the tragedy will be enacted. Directed by Tina Landau, the work is the latest in a series by En Garde, which has been setting drama in unexpected places since 1985.    Anne Hamburger, En Garde's founder and producer, has said the group's mission is to \"challenge the notion of the traditional well-made play\" and to \"create a theater that is visually exciting.\" Using dusk as its curtain, En Garde has presented works in Central Park and the meatpacking district, among other places. Indoor sites have included the Chelsea Hotel (for a second look at the punk rocker Sid Vicious and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen) and the dilapidated Victory Theater on West 42d Street.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"BEST SELLERS: June 27, 1993","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/books/best-sellers-june-27-1993.html","abstract":"                        Weeks       This   Last   On       Week   Week   List   Fiction                     1   1   46   THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, by Robert James Waller.

Although the settlement is large the clubs' appeal was by no means unusual. \n\nLast month a record 48,000 protests were filed with the County Board of Assessment Review, all but 13,000 from homeowners, according to the chairman of the board, Abe Seldin. That was a 20 percent increase over the 40,000 protests in 1992.\n\n\"Residential protests are up, because there are almost 100 law firms out there soliciting practically every homeowner in Nassau County,\" County Attorney Robert W. Schmidt said. \"Between 75 and 90 percent of the homeowners who protest their assessment get an adjustment.\"\n\nSuch adjustments, he added, do not generally result in a large tax cut, because many neighbors have also usually applied for and received reductions.\n\n\"It's like a tube of toothpaste,\" said a lawyer, Saul Fenchel of Garden City, who represented some of the golf clubs. \"If you squeeze one end, it has to give out at the other.\"\n\nHe said that the same amount of money still had to be raised through taxes to support government and that school districts received 55 to 60 percent of the property taxes collected by the county. The districts have built-in expenses like teachers' salaries and maintenance that have to be met. Unless cuts are made, Mr. Fenchel said, reductions in assessments mean increases in tax rates. \n\nAlthough the $8 million refund sounds large, Mr. Schmidt said, it \"is just a pebble\" in the total financial picture of Nassau. He said the county had spent $100,000 defending its case, calling in golf experts and architects to justify the original assessments.  The county based its judgments on the premise that using the land as a golf course was temporary and that its main and future use would be for residential development, which classified as the \"highest and best use.\"\n\nMr. Schmidt added that he did not believe that the court decision against the county would have effects outside Nassau.\n\nAnother lawyer who represented the clubs, Jay M. Herman of Mineola, said he \"wouldn't characterize it as an insignificant case.\" He pointed out that the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, Lee E. Koppelman, \"testified in our behalf against the county.\"\n\n\"It may have been the only time he testified for a private party,\" Mr. Herman said.\n\nMr. Herman said he had received telephone calls from lawyers outside Nassau asking for copies of the decision, Justice Frank S. Rossetti of State Supreme Court in Mineola on June 4, 1991, on the taxes of the 130-acre New Country Club of Garden City. He wrote that a decision by the county in 1986 to assess golf clubs as though they were residential developments was \"contrary to statutory and other fundamental principles of assessment valuation.\" Justice Rossetti directed that his decision be the basis for other clubs in the county.\n\nThe Town of Southampton used the decision as guidance last year, when it completed a townwide reassessment, said Assessor Edward T. Deyermond, who added: \n\n\"That court decision was one of the most widely disseminated decisions ever. We took it into account when we decided not to use an assessment based upon the highest and best use of the land, but rather, to determine the assessment rate based on potential income from the clubs.\"\n\nAs a result of the new rate, Mr. Deyermond said, some courses that had been assessed at $200 an acre were now as high as $1,500 an acre. As might be expected, he said, lawyers have already filed notices of intent to challenge the reassessments in court.\n\nIn the Nassau case the lawyers for the New Country Club showed that the Village of Garden City had a moratorium that precluded housing on the golf course. Justice Rossetti noted that Mr. Koppelman had testified that residential use was \"not probable in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nIn arriving at his decision, Justice Rossetti said, he had considered \"the importance of open land to Long Island's water supply (particularly its sole-source aquifer) and the deleterious effects to it and other necessary municipal services (such as garbage, traffic and recreation) from overdevelopment, particularly in an area such as Garden City, which is almost completely developed residentially.\"\n\n\"Thus,\" the decision added, \"while the golf club and other large-tract sales adduced by respondents admittedly indicated the strength of the demand for residential land in Nassau County, the many obstacles shown by petitioner evinced the reasonable probability that the subject golf course would not obtain all the approvals necessary within the reasonably foreseeable future.\"\n\nA lawyer for the club, Andrew G. Cangemi of Garden City, said that argument was crucial. \"You can't assess golf clubs based upon their potential use because of the vagaries of local governments,\" Mr. Cangemi said. \nSettlement With 30 Clubs\n\n After the decision, the county filed a notice of appeal. Lawyers representing 30 of the 34 clubs negotiated a settlement last year that called for a rollback in the assessments to the 1985 levels and a 25 percent reduction in the refund for each club. A lawyer for the clubs, Adolph Koeppel, said the appeal would have taken years, during which the clubs would have had to pay the higher assessments.\n\nOne lawyer said the taxes were so high that some clubs had to borrow money to pay them. Mr. Koeppel said the assessments had raised the taxes 60 to 70 percent.\n\nThe four clubs not in the suit had their rates lowered to the 1985 levels and agreed to have their refunds cut 28 percent, Mr. Schmidt said.\n\nThe difference between the 1986 and 1985 rates is striking, according to Mr. Cangemi. Under the revaluation, he said, the Glen Head Country Club paid $355,000 in taxes. Under the 1985 rate it paid $246,000 in taxes last year, saving more than $100,000.\n\nA spokesman for the 260-acre Glen Oaks Country Club in Old Westbury, which participated in the suit and received a $504,000 refund, called it a windfall, but said the \"best part is the assessment reduction we'll have from now on.\"\n\n\"We have a huge payroll and a $6 million budget, and this refund will allow us not to have to lay off people,\" the spokesman said. \"Sales are down because of the economy, which has been a real drag on the clubs. This decision is a benefit for everybody.\"\n\nBut the general manager of the Glen Head Country Club in Glen Head, Kevin F. Murphy, said: \"We don't consider it a windfall, but a disgrace that we had to pay our members' hard-earned dues money to get back money that was ours to begin with.\"\n\n\"The only guys who made out were the attorneys,\" Mr. Murphy said.  \"They got a fourth of the refund.\"\n\nDespite the rollbacks, county officials said, there has generally not been a significant increase in tax rates stemming from the case.\n\nIn Jericho, School Superintendent Robert Manheimer said that assessments in his district were down $700,000 last and that the Glen Oaks reduction might have been a major reason. But that loss, he said, was offset by increased state aid and new construction.\n\nDr. Manheimer said that he prepared the budget for next year based on a belief that assessments would be flat, but that he would not know whether he was right until the Board of Assessment Review ruled on the protests and released its figures on Aug. 1. If he is wrong and assessments are down, he added, the tax rate might have to rise.\nFirst Postwar Decline\n\n \"If over the next few years there is a continuing drop in assessments because of the appeals,\" Dr. Manheimer said, \"it is going to have to be reflected in higher tax rates, unless we decrease expenditures.\" \n\nAssessments in Nassau County last year dropped for the first time since World War II, according to Mr. Seldin. He attributed that to steady growth, which he said has been drying up and no longer offset reductions in assessments that have been routinely granted since a court decision in 1978 permitted assessments to fluctuate based on market values.\n\nThe reductions for the golf clubs, Mr. Seldin said, were taken into account when the county reduced the assessment roll last year, from $4,099,305,806 to $4,072,451,791. Another factor was a new depreciation system for utilities. Although it will be two months before the new as\n\nBefore the assessments were finalized last year, Mr. Seldin said, he had estimated a $9,400,000 increase in the rate. The final figure was a decrease of $26,854,000. He said he had estimated a $20,000 increase in the rate this year, but that the 48,000 protests will more than wipe that out.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Seldin, Thomas Preston, said that from 1978 to 1991, the latest available totals, the county refunded $338.6 million. The largest year for refunds was 1985, with $41.1 million. In 1991, $32.2 million was refunded.\n\nMr. Schmidt said that the refunds had been averaging $25 million a year and that although the school districts received more than half of that, Nassau was liable for the reimbursement under the County Charter. \n\nThat, however, is not the case in Suffolk County, where the 10 towns collect property taxes. Refunds in Suffolk have to be shared by the agencies that received the revenue. \"It's a no-man's land out there in Suffolk,\" Mr. Schmidt said. \"It's the Wild West.\"\n\nNassau has gone to Albany to try to persuade lawmakers to permit it to use that system. But, Mr. Schmidt said, strong opposition from Nassau school districts had killed those attempts.\n\nIn addition to Glen Oaks, eight other clubs have received refunds, and the others will receive their shortly, a spokesman for County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta said. \n\nLarger refunds went to the Atlantic Beach Club, $445,000; Glen Head, $295,000; the North Hempstead Country Club in Port Washington, $292,000, and the Rockville Country Club in Rockville Centre, $230,000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"One-Game Spot A Better Format","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/sports/l-one-game-spot-a-better-format-043893.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   Dave Anderson recently decried the proposed three-tier wild-card playoff format for baseball (\"When Second Best Is Not Near the Best,\" The Times, May 16).

Of course, after Woodstock they were broke. The 1991 Lollapalooza Festival, which turned the farewell tour by Jane's Addiction into an alternative-rock showcase and quasi-political sideshow, made a profit, as did its 1992 follow-up. So a third annual Lollapalooza was inevitable; it started at Thunderbird Stadium on June 18 and reaches the New York area (actually, Stanhope, N.J.) on July 12, 13 and 16.    Lollapalooza '93 places a new lineup of bands within the same setup as the 1992 version: a big stage and a smaller stage, a gathering of food and clothing vendors, hints (though, this year, little more) of political engagement. On the big stage are Primus, Alice in Chains, Dinosaur Jr., Fishbone, Arrested Development, Front 242, Rage Against the Machine and Babes in Toyland (or, for the second part of the tour, Tool); the four bands on the smaller stage will change throughout the tour. Because it kept last year's format with some shrinking margins -- there's no freak show, a big part of Lollapalooza '92 -- the opening show of Lollapalooza '93 was a slight letdown. But for the moment, it's still the closest thing to an alternative-rock summit for both performers and audience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"Atonal, of Course, But Deep Down He's Got Rhythm","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/arts/recordings-view-atonal-of-course-but-deep-down-he-s-got-rhythm.html","abstract":"  \"We are bringing them the plague,\" Sigmund Freud supposedly remarked as his ship docked in New York and delivered psychoanalysis to America. Arnold Schoenberg might have said something similar when he showed up in California in 1934 with his \"system for composing in 12 tones.\" In the postwar era, the 12-tone system swiftly spread through the American compositional community, and in the 1950's and 60's an even more difficult phenomenon called Serialism took hold.    Schoenberg's strict method, ordering the 12 pitches of the scale in nonrepeating atonal rows, was exhilarating therapy for composers beset by a multiplicity of stylistic choices. The plague was on audiences, who detested the jumbled, athematic textures common to the idiom. Schoenberg's conviction that his new system would replace the old proved to be foolish. The 12-tone order failed to make atonality second nature; at the same time, it tamed atonality's unnatural force.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"Linda Bellantoni, Carmine Venezia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/style/engagemnets-linda-bellantoni-carmine-venezia.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Robert Bellantoni of Seaside Park, N.J., have announced December wedding plans for their daughter Linda Patricia Bellantoni and Carmine Anthony Venezia, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Salvatore Venezia of Bethlehem, Pa.

The pulsed-dye laser is one of several selective vascular-lesion lasers capable of treating port-wine stains, hemangiomas, facial spider veins and cherry angiomas. Another is the copper-vapor laser, which also utilizes yellow light to specifically target red blood vessels. Presently, there are two pulsed-dye and two copper-vapor lasers available on Long Island. Different vascular lesions may respond better to one or the other. No laser has been proven safe and effective for the treatment of spider veins on the legs.   Regarding the removal of pigmented lesions and tattoos, three lasers have received F.D.A. approval. One, the q-switched ruby laser, was discussed in your article.

It is a sprawling city -- 450 square miles, with a population of 3.5 million -- bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, thinning out to a seemingly endless suburban frontier on the south, and rimmed on the north and east by a tangle of mountain ranges. Congested highways link its disparate parts without providing a sense of what lies in between. It can be a daunting, confusing place, too much to take in. But for those who seek the big picture, there is a road that begins to clarify L.A.\n\nMulholland Highway ribbons across the crest of the Santa Monica Mountains, the east-west tending range that separates the Los Angeles basin from the San Fernando Valley. Rising to about 3,000 feet, these are not high mountains, but they are strategically placed, beginning near Dodger Stadium and ending at the Pacific Ocean in Malibu (unless you count those partly submerged peaks that are the Channel Islands). Driving Mulholland's sinuous 55-mile course is the enterprise of one very busy day. Parks and scenic overlooks line the way, and the city unrolls on either side of you like an animated map. Close at hand on the eastern end are the \"ego homes\" of the rich and famous, clawing their way up the steep, chaparral-covered flanks of a swatch of the Santa Monicas called the Hollywood Hills. Farther west, Mulholland tightrope-walks across Sepulveda Pass and the San Diego Freeway, diminishes to dirt for nine miles above Encino, then emerges paved again, taking travelers on a wild, wheel-gripping ride through the mostly undeveloped heart of the mountains. As a scenic parkway, Mulholland abjures commercial development. However, food and fuel are available on any of the arteries that intersect it and lead down to the nonstop blandishments of Ventura Boulevard in the Valley or those siren thoroughfares to the south, Sunset and Hollywood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"As Expected, Senators Make Daigle Top Pick","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/sports/hockey-as-expected-senators-make-daigle-top-pick.html","abstract":"  As expected, center Alexandre Daigle of the Victoriaville Tigres was selected first over all by the Ottawa Senators in the National Hockey League entry draft today at le Colisee.

Despite being told that never in history had a horse injured in this fashion been saved I wondered if a new medical technique could be tried. At the least, maybe we could learn something to save the next injured horse. Still, the decision had to be made quickly; there could be no procrastination.\nSome Injuries Defy Medical Science\n\n I was in the van looking into the panicked eyes of the horse as his groom, trainer, vet, assistant trainer and members of the Belmont emergency staff worked to hold him upright, keeping him still and off his shattered leg. It was in this environment that I became convinced that no amount of money or the 50-plus years of veterinary experience that surrounded me could save Prairie Bayou's life and I faced the stark reality that there are some injuries that defy medical science. The decision to put Prairie Bayou to sleep was the most humane option and I chose it. It was my decision to make.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930627","headline":"A Death in the Party","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/books/a-death-in-the-party.html","abstract":"  SILENT CLOSE NO. 6 By Monika Maron.

Mr. McNally, the urbane and ferociously funny author of \"Lips Together, Teeth Apart,\" \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\" and \"The Lisbon Traviata,\" here takes a searching, if unfulfilled, journey into the mystical realms of India.   The G word in his title, which, as one line has it, \"sounds like a Jewish food,\" is in fact a reference to the Hindu god Ganesha, who is both a Puck-like character in the play (sweetly acted by Dominic Cuskern, wearing the requisite elephant's head) and a symbol of the transcendence to which Mr. McNally's two American heroines aspire.
