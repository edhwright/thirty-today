Opponents would prefer to keep chemical arms to deter the use of gas by others. And a recent revelation that Russia may be concealing efforts to develop advanced chemical weapons has fueled doubts about Washington's ability to verify compliance.    The U.S. has not relied on chemical weapons as a deterrent in recent years and it would be imprudent to do so now, given its superiority in conventional arms. Moreover, the U.S. would be a lot more secure with the treaty's verification provisions than without them. They provide ways to detect and stop suspicious activities by any state. The Senate would be wise to establish a global norm against chemical arms and use the treaty to enforce it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940629","headline":"Calm, Collected Katie Beers Testifies in Sex Abuse Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/29/nyregion/calm-collected-katie-beers-testifies-in-sex-abuse-case.html","abstract":"  For months, prosecutors had prepared for this day, first trying to avoid it entirely and then getting their young witness ready with a dress rehearsal in the courtroom and a luncheon with the judge.

As music director, Mr. Masur has thrown open the orchestra's doors for public discussions, open rehearsals and radio broadcasts. Ms. Borda, the executive director, has tried to lure untapped audiences by scheduling cheaper, shorter concerts at unusual times and festivals to highlight specific themes in music. Together, they have mended ties with a fractious, once-demoralized orchestra, winning critical acclaim for restoring its musical excellence.   Despite this string of successes, however, the Philharmonic has yet to shake the fiscal demons that have been haunting it, and other orchestras, in recent years. A deficit that first surfaced in 1990 will not disappear this year, as predicted. Rather, after dipping to $500,000, it is expected to surge past the $1 million mark again next year, suggesting that for all the cushions of a healthy endowment and well-placed friends, New York's premier orchestra is not immune to the trials confronting orchestras across America, and must invent new strategies for survival.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940630","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/style/chronicle-539546.html","abstract":"  What was the PRINCESS OF WALES doing last night while her estranged husband, PRINCE CHARLES, was on television confessing his marital infidelity during a lengthy interview?

As years passed, the Socialists exerted almost no influence over the conservative, increasingly corrupt power structure, and it has suffered its own corruption scandals. But the party remained the second-largest in Parliament, and its position struck a resonant chord with many Japanese. Most people regarded the Socialists as unsuited to govern but a useful check against the Liberal Democrats.  A Setback for Anti-Americanism    Never was this moral stance more in evidence than in 1960, when rioting broke out among Japanese who opposed extending the postwar security treaty with the United States.

That budget reduced the work force by 15,000 employees, to 201,000. But Mr. Giuliani said the union bills could make him lay off thousands more, and he warned that he would start doing so before Mr. Cuomo and the legislators face re-election in November.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940630","headline":"A Vegetarian Answer : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/opinion/IHT-a-vegetarian-answer-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding the opinion column \"A Small Price to Pay for Proving Malthus Wrong\" (June 9):.Jessica Mathews laments mankind's need to increase global food production, yet she merely mentions in passing how the Western appetite for meat fuels the t","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940630","headline":"The Pop Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/arts/the-pop-life-536970.html","abstract":"  Woodstock, Anyone?

That is the accomplishment of Bryan A. Stevenson and Stephen B. Bright, members of the anti-death-penalty team, who spend much of their off-camera time fighting capital punishment in the Southern states that account for 90 percent of America's executions. In Georgia, Mr. Stevenson says, \"If the defendant is black and the victim is white, you are 22 times more likely to get  the death penalty.\" Mr. Bright speaks of legal lynchings.

It opened with the group Black Note, a quintet of young musicians from Los Angeles  that takes its inspiration in part from early Wynton Marsalis, meaning its harmonies are modern and a bit acidic. The group set up a changing background for solos, a static chord for one improviser, swinging rhythms for the next. They sounded a bit like a student group, earnest young improvisers moving through their prearranged lines and ideas and never really improvising. The music rarely moved beyond the polite.         The guitarist James (Blood) Ulmer followed. Over the years he has become a self-parodist. He sings on most of his songs now, in a deep, near-Jimi Hendrix growl. Occasionally he played odd and beautiful guitar solos, metallic and compressed. He saved his most ambitious piece for last, a composition that moved from swinging sections to hard rock and never ventured into the banalities of his singing. Mr. Ulmer's sound and his harmonies, pumped through an electric guitar and overdriven amplifier, are sulfuric at times, chilly at others. He's distinct, though his concerts hardly ever let an audience know what he's capable of doing.

Chief Justice Rehnquist said the buffer zone \"burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake.\" Under the same analysis, the Court also upheld a ban on excessive noise during the clinic's operating hours, finding the restrictions justified by the need to \"insure the health and well-being of the patients at the clinic.\" [Excerpts, page A16.]   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940701","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/arts/art-in-review-014435.html","abstract":"    'American Realism and Impressionism' 'Drawings, Prints and Photographs' Metropolitan Museum of Art Fifth Avenue at 82d Street Through July 24   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940701","headline":"Supreme Court Ups and Downs;The Voting Rights Wreckers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/opinion/supreme-court-ups-and-downs-the-voting-rights-wreckers.html","abstract":"The Supreme Court chipped away again yesterday at efforts to give minority voters greater voice under the Federal Voting Rights Act.
