With a velvety sound that gauged the small playing space perfectly, Mr. Gampel made his New York City recital debut at the Frick Collection on Wednesday afternoon. He thrived on the Scriabin Second Sonata and Chopin's Variations on \"La ci darem la mano,\" but seemed more than a little uneasy in Schubert's Impromptus (D. 899) and the Schumann \"Faschingsschwank aus Wien.\"   When Scriabin's florid, ever-moving detail or Schubert's rhythmic left-hand accompaniments locked Mr. Gampel's melodic movement into place, the pianist became a sound interpreter. When confronted with unadorned melody, however, he seemed at a loss. The Intermezzo from the Schumann, for example, is phrased in one dramatic breath: an upward leap and downward swoop toward dissonance and resolution; Mr. Gampel draws back in mid-plunge, totally dismantling the effect. Similar interruptions undid the tensions of the earlier Romance section. Ritards, accelerations and accentuation, in other words, must sound absolutely necessary to a performance.

Pop music has veered sharply away from everything the group's core, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, cared about most.    Instead of Steely Dan's cool, subtle, meticulous, elegantly ironic songs, matching oblique lyrics to harmonically ambiguous jazz chords, the rock mainstream has turned toward noise, simplicity and blunt impact. Where Mr. Becker and Mr. Fagen could agonize for months over perfecting a smooth transition, hip-hop has brought sudden jump-cuts instead. The band's influence has survived mostly in pop-jazz tunes that saunter along, half-heard, on background-music radio stations. Steely Dan camouflaged its subversive edge a little too well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Sports of The Times; Confessions Of a Lifelong Yankee-Hater","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/sports/sports-of-the-times-confessions-of-a-lifelong-yankee-hater.html","abstract":"  DOCTOR, doctor, thanks for seeing me so quickly.

Will the Blue Jays allow themselves to be caught? Can the American League East even be called a two-team pennant race yet? Maybe, maybe and probably not are the answers to the above questions. They are questions that will linger as the final 40 games of the season are played and the Yankees, Red Sox and maybe the Orioles continue pursuing the Jays. The second-place Yankees, who have not spent even a day alone in first place this season, could be boosted or buried by certain developments as they attempt to slice their two-game gap. Ways to Boost Yanks' Chances ABBOTT AND PEREZ   Significant contributions from Melido Perez and Jim Abbott. The excuses are growing old. Solid starts and games that could have or should have been won by these two underachievers are no longer important, only victories are. With about eight starts each left, both Perez and Abbott need to pitch supremely better than .500 for the Yankees to continue contending. They are a combined 15-21 with a 4.38 e.r.a. after both had e.r.a.'s under 2.90 last season. They need at least 10 victories in their last 16 starts to make their winter bearable. GETTING CLOSER TO A CLOSER   Rob Dibble, Rick Aguilera, Dennis Eckersley and Bryan Harvey. Those intriguing reliever names have been floated and others are likely to follow, but none are likely to float onto the Yankee roster before it is set for post-season play in 11 days. General Manager Gene Michael has been adamant about not trading away prospects so the new-look bullpen with Bob Wickman and Paul Assenmacher in prominent roles could remain intact.  DEPENDING ON DON MATTINGLY   Perhaps this is finally his year, the year when he finally plays in the post-season. Perhaps, but his robust bat cannot stop spraying hits just yet. Enjoying a 53-game splurge that has seen him hit .369 with 12 homers and 54 runs batted in, Mattingly must do more and more. Or, at least more of the same over the final 40 games. ROAD WARRIORS   Playing above .500 on the lonesome road. They have lost 16 of their last 25 on the road. They play 22 of their last 40 on the road. Figure out the statistics and the odds are not good for a stylish conclusion to their road schedule, but it is needed. Starting Monday in Chicago, the Yanks must play better than their .475 percentage and win at least 12 of their last 22 away from home. That includes a journey to Toronto on Sept. 24-26, which they hope will still be meaningful. Ways to Bury Yanks' Chances A SLUMP BY JIMMY KEY   He is the best the Yankees have. He is 15-4 with a league-best 2.83 earned run average and is fighting Jack McDowell for the Cy Young Award. But his glorious season has not been so glorious lately. Key is 3-2 with a 4.47 e.r.a. in his last six starts after surrendering 22 earned runs and 50 hits in 44 1/3 innings. For Jimmy Key, he is struggling. The Yankees need him to regain his form he displayed so consistently for much of the season. A LOSING STREAK AT HOME   The Stadium has been a haven for the Yankees. They have won 30 of their last 40 games in the Bronx and have the second finest home record in the league. That cannot change. The Yankees and Blue Jays have a somewhat similar schedule over the final six weeks, with each playing 22 of their final 40 games onthe road but New York stil has to play the A.L. West-contending White Sox, Royals and Rangers 15 times while Toronto plays the lowly A's and Angels and stumbling Mariners 19 games. OFFENSE PETERS OUT   Mike Stanley and Paul O'Neill have provided the Yankees with timely hits all season. Make that until the last two weeks. Stanley, who could end his season today with the best statistics of his professional life, has no homers, three runs batted in and a .205 average in his last 14 games. Is the grind of the season catching up with the former backup catcher? O'Neill, once second in the league in batting, is 5 for his last 31 to shrink 13 points off his average and lower it to .312. Is .300 still within reach? INJURY TO TARTABULL   Manager Buck Showalter can burn inside about Tartabull playing only one game in the outfield since July 15 because of a shoulder injury, but he should really just be thankful that Tartabull can swing a bat. If Tartabull remains healthy enough to hit, the Yankee lineup remains healthy. Do you think Mattingly's resurgence has anything to do with having Tartabull behind him? Sure it does. Since the last time Tartabull played right field, he has hit nine homers and driven in 32 runs to help the Yankees go 21-11. Ignore that Tartabull is clogging up the designated hitter slot and leave him there.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/nyregion/c-corrections-261793.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Wednesday about Thomas B.

The second group performed on Thursday night: Michael Hayes as the itinerant Prince, Laura Claycomb as his spring fling Kathie, and Robert Perry as the doomed Dr. Engel. All three young singers were making their City Opera debuts; given the particular demands of the Romberg manner, it's hard to pass judgment on their general operatic skills, but two of them showed promise.   Mr. Hayes had a confident and accurate tenor, wooden at times but thoroughly idiomatic. His acting was hardly less impressive; alongside his three Heidelberg buddies (of whom Gordon Gietz's Detlef deserves to be singled out), he artfully conveyed the obnoxious collegiate drunkenness crucial to Act II. Ms. Claycomb, a soprano, did not do quite as well, struggling with the high notes and making her character seem strangely feckless. She missed the rousing, buoyant spirit appropriate to a number like \"Come Boys, Let's All Be Gay Boys.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"1943: Fortresses Attack : IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/opinion/IHT-1943-fortresses-attack-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] American Flying Fortresses flew through heavy weather and bitter fighter opposition to attack German airdromes at Flushing and Gilze-Rijen, in Holland, yesterday [Aug. 19], following a day-long assault by lighter Alli","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Review/Film; A Feminist Cross-Dresser in the Old West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/movies/review-film-a-feminist-cross-dresser-in-the-old-west.html","abstract":"Female cross-dresser in Old West.

Although many of its characters are Jews caged in the Czechoslovak ghetto city of Theresienstadt and face imminent deportation to death camps, you wouldn't know it from the way they talk. Musing on their fate, they adopt the sorrowful-to-sardonic tone of Chekhov aristocrats lamenting the boorishness of modern life. Everybody in the movie, including the Nazis, speaks in an impeccable \"Masterpiece Theater\"-style English that rarely rises above the volume of drawing-room conversation.   The mood of calm despair that hangs over the film lends it a disquietingly surreal aura.

Like most people who achieved their broadest fame in movies, she seems frozen in memory at the point when that fame was greatest, and one still thinks of her poised resiliently on the cusp of middle age, as she was in her Oscar-winning performance in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" nearly 20 years ago. Still, if Mick Jagger can go ahead and turn 50, why shouldn't Ms. Burstyn -- who has publicly sworn she will do one play a year, come what may -- be allowed to play Alfred Uhry's Miss Daisy, as she did in Chicago five years ago, or Carrie Watts, the slyly willful old woman in Horton Foote's \"Trip to Bountiful\"?   The latter has been revived in a cleanly staged, sincere-minded production that began life at Theaterfest in Upper Montclair, N.J., and has now been brought by the Phoenix Theater Company to its Performing Arts Center on the State University campus here.

But \"Multiple Images: Photographs Since 1965 From the Collection,\" the ambitious show now at the Museum of Modern Art, demonstrates that in recent years artists have worked eagerly and effectively to undermine that assumption.   \"Multiple Images\" shows how pervasive the idea of including more than one image in a single work has become. The show, the first organized by Sheryl Conkelton, the museum's new associate curator of photography, includes work by Jan Groover, Andy Warhol, Robert Cumming, Richard Avedon and many other artists. Judging from the works on view, perhaps the most frequent use photographers have made of multiple images has been to create what are in effect mini-movies, sequences of images that describe an event not in a single glimpse but as a series of moments. Some of these works are explicitly narrative, using dramatic staging and lighting that suggest conventions of Hollywood genre films.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Israel Drops the Veil","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/opinion/israel-drops-the-veil.html","abstract":"  There will be something startlingly different, in form if not substance, when the stalemated Mideast peace talks resume in Washington at the end of the month.

Israelis will negotiate directly with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Mr. Rabin says Israel is meeting with individuals, not an organization, but all parties recognize this as a significant change.   There's still a big gap between Israeli and Arab bargaining positions, and Secretary of State Christopher's recent trip to the region didn't do much to narrow it. Yesterday's bloody exchanges with Party of God guerrillas in Lebanon didn't help either.
