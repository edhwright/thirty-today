In an audacious, freshly conceived performance, Mr. Thomas stands the orthodox interpretation of Shakespeare's lugubrious, unseated king on its head -- or, to be more precise, on its feet.   For this is not the usual cerebral Richard, the poet king who melts from regal arrogance into introspective resignation, a character Samuel Johnson, for one, accused of having too much \"passive fortitude\" for a monarch. Once Mr. Thomas's Richard hands over his crown to the usurping Bolingbroke, he does not go at all quietly into oblivion.   An actor of prodigious physical energy (as anyone who saw his indefatigably inventive \"Peer Gynt\" with the Hartford Stage Company a few years ago can testify), Mr. Thomas invests the King with an active, blazingly kinetic anger and uses the character's soliloquies on disposession as slyly confrontational speeches to sting the consciences of his betrayers.   When scholars note that Richard foreshadows Hamlet, they are usually referring to the character's paralyzing melancholy. Mr. Thomas, who has played Hamlet, finds another, more provocative level of kinship: the \"antic disposition\" of crafty, double-edged madness and a fierce sense that the world he believes in has suddenly gone out of joint. The resulting performance turns a poetic meditation of a play into an evening of dynamic jolts and surprises.     Though Mr. Thomas's performance is longer on bravado than subtlety (and occasionally marred by an excessively plummy accent), it is carefully and consistently thought out. Richard was only 11 years old when he ascended the throne, and in this production, 20 years into his reign, he remains a medieval child king: a man brought up to believe that his country is, unchangingly, his own colorful board game.   Clad in radiant gold and white brocade, with a long pre-Raphaelite blond mane, the Richard of the pre-abdication scenes wears his raiment (perhaps a bit too obviously) like a tantrum-prone little boy playing dress-up. He is clearly in love with the part: he pronounces edicts of banishment and taxation gleefully, more with the exhilaration of capricious power than with any firm sense of political consequence.   Accordingly, when finally forced to acknowledge the growing popularity of Bolingbroke's rebellion, he delivers his famous heaven-summoning apostrophe on divine right like a boy reciting fairy tales he has never previously been given evidence to disbelieve. Once it becomes clear these fantasies are false, he turns abruptly into a colossally astonished, Cassandra-like prophet of national doom, and the entire production slips into high, aggressive gear.   When Richard descends from the balcony of a castle in Wales to meet the rebel Bolingbroke on his own ground, he marches down the stairs in a petulant, tight-lipped fury that portends the explosions to come. The most incendiary of these occurs in the legendary scene in which Richard asks for a mirror to see if the king's face still even exists.   He does not, as the text indicates, dash the mirror to the ground. Rather, he shatters it against his forehead, drawing blood, and smears the hand of Bolingbroke (now Henry IV) with it as he kneels before him. What is usually presented as a symbol of disintegrating narcissism becomes an outward gesture of ferocious defiance. It has something of the harrowing effect of Lucia di Lammermoor arriving at her wedding reception in a bloodied nightgown.   It could be argued that Mr. Thomas's performance is too extroverted. If the play is fundamentally about a king who loses his throne to find himself, Mr. Thomas never quite convinces us of that metamorphosis. Indeed, Richard's final, inwardly burrowing soliloquy in prison never really takes off until he finds new cause for active indignation. But basically Mr. Thomas's interpretation has a sustained, compelling logic, and it infuses the entire play with an unexpected ardor.   The production that surrounds Mr. Thomas is always serviceable, and sometimes more. Mr. Kahn has staged the play as a Darwinian transition from a frozen medievalism to a more brutal, fluid world of pragmatic politics. This is underscored both by Tom Broecker's costumes, which juxtapose Richard's burnished luminescence against the more somber clothing of the courtiers, and Derek McLane's set, which places platforms on crude scaffolding before a massive gold-toned reproduction of the Westminster Abbey portrait of Richard.   In the course of the play, this portrait is dismantled, and the final image, with Bolingbroke triumphant, is one of a dark stage strewn with bodies. While visually effective, there is something a little dishonest about this, as it suggests a nostalgia for a more regimented world that Shakespeare himself had little affection for.    The supporting performances, while occasionally flat, include strong contributions from Edward Gero, as a calculating, increasingly careworn Bolingbroke, and Franchelle Stewart Dorn, in a robust comic turn as the Duchess of York. And as directed by Mr. Kahn, the actors are usually able to find the energy in what can be a static text.   Ultimately, though, the production belongs to Mr. Thomas. Throughout this century, Richard II has attracted an august assortment of stars, from John Gielgud to Jeremy Irons. It is to Mr. Thomas's credit that he makes the part so distinctly his own, with a fiery style that should rightfully banish forever the ghost of the gentle, fawn-faced John-Boy Walton, the television role that made him a star. With Nigel Hawthorne now touring the country with the National Theater production of Alan Bennett's \"Madness of George III,\" it is a very good year in America for unhinged British kings.

The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join together in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the true cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. The Overseer A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators of the quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising quesions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. The Payers EMPLOYERS Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in their region, and to support family coverage for married workers. EMPLOYEES Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. SELF-EMPLOYED AND NON-WORKERS Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently, only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. GOVERNMENT Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. LARGE CORPORATIONS Woudl have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. The Brokers HEALTH ALLIANCES The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for service provided outside H.M.O.'s. ACCESS: All citizens and legal residents would be covered. COST: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. ELIGIBLE PLANS: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. OPTIONS: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is oversubscribed. QUALITY: Alliances would publish information to help consumers compare the service and the medical performance of various plans. SIZE: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Large cities would have one alliance. STRUCTURE: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance. CORPORATE ALLIANCES If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their own alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employeees might have fewer providers to choose from. The Options Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service option offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,800 a year for an individual and $4,200 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in prices; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O. The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subscribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay 40 percent of the bill. Combination Plan The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. The Benefits All Americans would be issued a \"health security card\" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Preventive care for children. Adult benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions. Eye & Ear: Routine vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: for terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices. when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents further deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illnes or injry. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive Care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not \"medically necessary or appropriate,\" citing cosmetic orthodntia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services. A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected Working, with good insurance Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as they received care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits beyond those in the standard package remain tax-free to employee for 10 years. Working, uninsured Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, if family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. (The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.) Nonworkers or Unemployed Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with unearned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost of premium if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line.  Part-time workers Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a pro-rated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-employed Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribution toward the employer share -- 80 percent of average premium cost -- they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax-deductible, compared to 25 percent now.  Two-earner families In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute, and each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share -- 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors. Household employee For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Retiree, under 65 The Government would subsidize retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. If not covered by former employer or pension plan, they could get coverage through the alliance and pay only 20 percent of the cost of an average premium, as though they were employed. Part-time work or a spouse's earnings would alter the subsidies. Medicare recipient The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or better current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in former health plan, paying any difference between Medicare contribution and plan cost.  Medicaid recipients Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state governments would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment.  Student Students attending school full-time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy, would sign up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage.  Illegal immigrants Not eligible for coverage through the health alliances, but could still receive emergency and other care as they do now.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930923","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/nyregion/c-corrections-009793.html","abstract":"  A report in the Food Notes column of The Living Section yesterday about the annual Hudson Valley Garlic Festival misstated the date.

The audience was on its feet, often dancing; the English band's lead singer, David Gahan, was twitching his hips like Mick Jagger, shaking his shoulder-length hair like Bono of U2, whirling his microphone stand and throwing his hands in the air to cue shouts and sing-alongs. The crowd squealed when Mr. Gahan tossed off his jacket and, later, his shirt.   But the rock-star preening made an odd match with the songs. Martin Gore, Depeche Mode's songwriter, specializes in dark introspection and minor keys; Alan Wilder, who arranges the songs, fills them with foreboding, reverberant sounds that turn declarations of love into something unsettling. For Depeche Mode, love is no idyll; its transcendence comes with a fearful, annihilating obsession. The concert opened with \"Higher Love\" -- with Mr. Gahan intoning, \"I surrender heart and soul\" -- and concluded, before encores, with \"In Your Room,\" in which the singer promised to be \"your favorite slave.\" Behind him, video screens showed shadowy embraces by nearly nude figures wearing leather cuffs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930923","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/nyregion/inside-348193.html","abstract":"  New Jersey Tax Fight Rises   Governor Florio said the tax cut plan of his opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, was a \"voodoo\" program meant to help the wealthy.

It was the second sanction against Olympique Marseilles. The European federation earlier this month excluded the team from defending its European Champions Cup title. The former manager, Jean-Pierre Bernes, who is charged with paying or trying to pay members of the Valenciennes team in northern France up to $43,000 to go easy on Marseilles in a match on May 20, was banned from the sport until further notice. The French soccer federation made its announcement under tomorrow's deadline imposed by FIFA, the sport's international governing body, to take action or be barred from global competition. France currently leads European Group 6 in qualifying play for the 1994 World Cup and is scheduled to play host to the 1998 World Cup finals. Further sanctions will hinge on the outcome of the trials of those charged, the French federation said.

Mrs. Whitman's picture remains on screen as a swerving, skidding car appears in background; then background now shows an assailant grabbing a young woman with ponytail in a parking lot.\nTHE SCRIPT: \"Christine Todd Whitman wants to legalize certain assault weapons. Now another fact. Christine Todd Whitman has a proposal to weaken New Jersey's drunk driving laws. Instead of suspending their licenses, Whitman would issue some drunk drivers different colored license plants and let them drive again. But that's not all. With an epidemic of carjacking, Whitman is against mandatory sentences for carjackers. Assault weapons. Weaker drunk driving laws. No mandatory sentences for carjackers. Does Whitman even understand?\nANALYSIS: The last words fairly drip with condecension, as if a slow student had been observed signing up for a Great Books course. As for accuracy, Mrs. Whitman's questioning of the effectiveness of some automatic sentencing laws -- along lines expressed by Attorney General Janet Reno, the Democrats own top law enforcer -- has been twisted to suggest she is soft on crime. For instance, a drunk driving conviction brings an automatic six-month suspension of driving privileges. She proposed that in special cases, as when a first-time offender's livelihood was dependent on driving, a color-coded license could be issued to allow travel between home and work. She said her concern was to preserve the individual's job and not force another family into costly social dependency, but that reasoned position is nowhere in sight here.\nCANDIDATE: Christine Todd Whitman\nPRODUCER: The Murphy Pintak Gautier Agency, Washington.\nVISUAL: Mrs. Whitman, attired in a tailored red jacket, is shown in medium closeup, peering directly into the camera. She looks earnest, but she manages a smile at the conclusion of her remarks.\nTHE SCRIPT: \"Jim Florio thinks this election is about fooling you with untrue negative ads. I say it's about fixing New Jersey's economy. So, as Governor I am going to cut your taxes every year for the next three years, 10 per cent each year for most people, less for those in the higher brackets. Cutting taxes will create more jobs and force Trenton to reduce spending. We know what Jim Florio's taxes and spending did to our economy. Now we have to clean up the mess. I'm Christine Whitman.\"\nANALYSIS: The tax cut gambit can be two-edged because, in these times, even voters who rely on television ads to make their choice can be cynical about campaign promises that sound too good to be true. For this one to fly, the promise has to be buttressed by substantive argument, perhaps using Perot-like pie charts to push the product and explain how such enormous budget cuts are possible. Otherwise it could boomerang by allowing Mr. Florio to portray the plan as a windfall for Republican fat cats. So far, however, Ms. Whitman has not mastered the art of TV pitchwoman. -- JOHN NORDHEIMER","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930923","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/nyregion/bridge-752593.html","abstract":"  In a social evening at the Westbury Hotel, 15 East 69th Street, Tuesday night, more than $40,000 was raised for the Israel Cancer Research Fund.

If judged solely on its human rights record, China would be found lacking. But I believe that if seen through the lens of realism, as a means to influence the future, the benefits of allowing Beijing to hold the 2000 Games far outweigh the negative effects.\n\nOne such benefit would be to accelerate China's opening to the rest of the world. As part of the global community, China is more likely to adjust its conduct in line with international norms. Of course, we cannot say for certain that rejecting Beijing's bid would cause China to close its doors. But we can be sure that choosing Beijing would force the Government to become more open, at least on the surface.\n\nSuch a decision would also promote internal reform. There are already signs that if China is not permitted to host the Games, conservative forces in the Communist Party will further stir nationalistic, xenophobic sentiment and attack factions that have been closer to America and Europe.

If he holds on to his strength, Russia may turn a crucial corner in creating democratic institutions.   Two groups will be among the arbiters of the confrontation: the military and the heads of provincial governments. Since the failed coup of August 1991, Russia's generals have sought to keep their institution out of politics and have largely succeeded.

Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, released a new television commercial this week that tries to burnish his image as a hardened crime fighter with a soft touch for the common folk. The commercial, one of three new radio and television commercials released this week, neatly prefaced a major speech by Mr. Giuliani yesterday that brought together his anti-crime proposals. PRODUCER   The Garth Group of New York. ON THE SCREEN   The one-minute commercial has the gritty texture and quick pacing of the 11 o'clock television news. It opens in a Brooklyn restaurant kitchen where a worker surrounded by collanders and pans waxes nostaglic about times when people weren't afraid to sit outside at night. In rapid succession, tight shots of people identified as Brooklyn community activists in various locations -- a book-lined room, a city park, an office -- talking about neighborhoods gripped by fear of crime. Then scenes of Mr. Giuliani walking under an elevated subway talking animatedly to a young man, bending down to chat with an elderly woman, shaking hands with a woman outside a city housing project. At the end, underneath a shot of the restaurant worker, are the words: \"Rudolph Giuliani -- You know (underlined) he'll be tough on crime.\" THE SCRIPT   Paul Balsamo, restaurant worker: \"I remember when I was a kid, that Avenue N used to be lined with people just sitting out in front of their houses or in front of their apartments at night to cool off. And you don't see that anymore because everybody's afraid to come out at night.\"   Madge Ford, community activist: \"We, as honest, tax-payin' citizens, are really tired of living behind iron bars and the criminals going free.\"   Carlos Hernandez, anti-drug activist: \"You can't even stand out with kids or in front of our stores because we might be afraid there might be a shootout, might be something happening.\"   Myrtle Whitmore, community activist: \"There seems to be no one at the top to say, look guys, this has got to stop. Now Rudolph Giuliani was a U.S. Attorney. He was our lawyer. He's gone to bat for us.\"   Ms. Ford: \"Rudy Giuliani could bring this city together by first getting rid of the problems that separate us.\"   Mr. Balsamo: \"That would be a very big help to us. Just to keep the neighborhood a little safer and make it safer for our kids.\" SCORECARD   The commercial tries to capture Mr. Giuliani's overarching vision of a gentler city while making a targeted pitch to voters in Brooklyn, where the mayoral battle is expected to be close. By having speakers who are white, Hispanic and black talk about Mr. Giuliani's effectiveness as a crime fighter, the commercial tries to convey the message that his support is broad based, that his message cuts across racial lines and that he could be a racial healer -- something he needs people to believe if they are going to vote against the city's first black mayor. And while touting Mr. Giuliani as a tough prosecutor, it suggests that Mayor David N. Dinkins has been soft on criminals -- a theme that may resonate with some voters but also may seem hollow to liberals who contend Mr. Dinkins has expanded the police department at the expense of other city services.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"A Return Trip to Vietnam","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/style/IHT-a-return-trip-to-vietnam.html","abstract":"An hour's drive from Ho Chi Minh City, you can visit one of the most remarkable engineering feats of any war, the remnants of the Cu Chi tunnels, a 250-kilometer network. .The U.S. helicopter on display in the jungle near the tunnels has \"Charlie","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"On My Mind; A Charity No More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/opinion/on-my-mind-a-charity-no-more.html","abstract":"  I had doubts about the Clinton health plan -- too complicated, too much new bureaucracy, and where was the money to come from?

Here, the Trenton poor and the Princeton Ivy Leaguers vote Democratic, the prosperous business suburbanites favor Republicans, and Gerald R. Stockman and Richard J. LaRossa are struggling in a Senate race for the same shifting middle that will probably decide the race for governor as well.   For Democrats like Mr. Stockman and Gov. Jim Florio, the 15th was once considered so safe a seat that Mr. Stockman, then a 10-year incumbent State Senator, was chosen to sponsor Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990. The next year, Mr. La Rossa harnessed anger over the taxes to his fame as the man who called the state lottery results on television and won a humbling upset over Mr. Stockman. It was a defeat that the state Democrats ardently want to reverse. 'Not Something I Brag About'    \"This was the most Democratic district in the state until I lost,\" Mr. Stockman, a 57-year-old trial lawyer, said recently as he doggedly worked the sidewalks and front porches of Trenton's West Ward. \"It's not something I brag about.\" Indeed, Mr. La Rossa is the first Republican to represent the city of Trenton in the Senate since 1946, the year, he likes to point out, when he was born.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930924","headline":"Review/Photography; Another Side of a Life's Work, Elegantly Revealed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/arts/review-photography-another-side-of-a-life-s-work-elegantly-revealed.html","abstract":"  In the 1930's and 40's, George Platt Lynes achieved both fame and commercial success with cool, Surrealist-influenced photographs of fashion and dance, as well as portraits of such artists and writers as Jean Cocteau, E.

The exhibition, which opens to the public on Sunday and occupies nine specially built galleries on the museum's second floor, is the largest devoted to Mr. Ryman's quietly ravishing white-on-white paintings in this country. Its 83 works span almost 40 years, from the mid-1950's, when the artist was exposed to the tenets of Abstract Expressionism while working as a guard at the Modern, to the present, when he is widely considered one of the most important painters of the postwar period.    But contrary to the usual display methods at major museums, there's not a single label or text panel in sight, a condition that even the most seasoned art viewer may find a bit disorienting.

It will occupy the space that was formerly the Quilted Giraffe and will have 220 seats at cafe tables in the plaza of the building, an area that was originally an open arcade but is being enclosed.   In keeping with Sony's entertainment theme, Maury Rubin, the owner of City Bakery, plans to install a giant popcorn machine. He said that ready-made salads and sandwiches would be available cafeteria style and that there would also be a coffee bar, a juice bar and a cocoa bar. It's midtown's gain.
