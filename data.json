Mr. Bluiett's sound is heavy, as if it had been made under compression, and at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night he didn't even bother to use a microphone. He just let his sound jump out into the room and take over.   Mr. Bluiett's engagement at the Vanguard, continuing through Sunday, is rare on two counts: he hardly ever leads a band in New York, and he's playing with a rhythm section that, for him, is surprisingly conventional. Though Mr. Bluiett has led a big band and worked with Charles Mingus, he is best known for his role in founding the World Saxophone Quartet and for his connections to jazz's avant-garde. He should use a traditional band more often. In his first set, on two ballads, \"I'll Close My Eyes\" and \"Sophisticated Lady,\" Mr. Bluiett, with his sure command of drama, made a case for himself as one of the better ballad players in jazz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/nyregion/c-corrections-206156.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday about clashes in the Gaza Strip referred incorrectly in some editions to the site of a Palestinian death.

Black Sabbath relies, wisely, on material from its first decade, when Ozzy Osbourne was its lead singer and the band was inventing a school of heavy metal. Black Sabbath mixed bulldozing, stop-start riffs, histrionic high-tenor singing and lyrics that veered from tortured idealism to visions of Satanic rituals.

The Brentano String Quartet made an irresistible case for itself at its New York debut on Tuesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall. Its players -- Mark Steinberg and Serena Canin, violinists; Misha Amory, violist, and Michael Kannen, cellist -- have all attracted attention as soloists in recent seasons. Together, they produce a magnificently blended sound with a remarkable coloristic range.    The concert was presented by the Guild of Composers, so the focus was on contemporary works, with early Berg and late Beethoven providing depth of perspective. Seymour Shifrin's Quartet No. 5 (1975) opened the program. Nearly 20 years after its composition, the work's language -- gracefully angular, scampering, sometimes sensuous, sometimes eerie -- seems quaint and almost nostalgic. And in this group's vivid account it took on an almost visual quality: if you stopped concentrating on musical syntax, the sounds evoked the seemingly chaotic squiggles, slashing lines and bursts of color of a Jackson Pollock painting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Hard Times, Not Fraud, Explain Loan Defaults; Heroic Jordan College","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/opinion/l-hard-times-not-fraud-explain-loan-defaults-heroic-jordan-college-213624.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your Feb. 4 article on the default rates in Federal student loan programs unfairly portrays Jordan College.

The most romantic ending was in an older song, \"Vincent Black Lightning 1952,\" in which a dying thief hands his motorcycle keys to his beloved. Between songs, Mr. Thompson offered droll banter, but there was little comfort when he sang.   Mr. Thompson draws his pessimism from a long tradition of bleakly stoic British traditional songs. His melodies, too, reflect Celtic modal scales and the rhythms of jigs and reels and strathspeys. But Mr. Thompson's traditionalism is hot-wired with modern elements: the verse-chorus-bridge structures of pop songs, Chuck Berry guitar licks, harmonies that wander where folk songs never strayed, and lyrics that recognize a modern, urban world.

Balaban of Copiague told a panel of the State Legislature holding the first statewide hearing on environmental factors in breast cancer.  'Two Years Behind'    Ms. Balaban, the director of the New York State Breast Cancer Hot Line, and other cancer-prevention advocates said measures curbing pesticide use in schools and parks and on golf courses and lawns should be enacted promptly as precautions.    They also criticized a two-year reporting lag in a tumor-incidence list compiled by the State Health Department.   \"We need accurate local and statewide registries so that we know where we are,\" said Lorraine Pace of West Islip, who was recently named a breast cancer education specialist at University Hospital Center here.   \"It's interesting that our tumor registering is two years behind each diagnosis and yet our state lottery is only seconds behind the picking of the numbers,\" she said.    The National Cancer Institute announced a five-year, $5 million study of breast cancer on Long Island last fall, the most extensive study of its kind to date. The breast cancer rate on Long Island is among the highest in the country.   In 1992 a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta suggested that high incidence of breast cancer on Long Island might be linked to rich diets, affluent life styles, age and ethnic origin.    Long Island groups criticized the report and petitioned the National Cancer Institute for a more comprehensive study.    Cancer prevention advocates said today that evidence shows that some pesticide ingredients mimic estrogen or spur its production in the body. They said this effect alone was grounds for new restrictions.    Estrogenic chemicals can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells, some experts say.    Michael Surgan, an environmental scientist in the State Attorney General's office, said that Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell supported a law giving counties and municipalities the power to regulate pesticides.    Currently the State Department of Environmental Conservation regulates pesticides that are labeled safe by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.    \"Long Island should be able to regulate,\" Mr. Surgan said. He said a survey showed that golf course operators on Long Island applied an average of seven times more pesticides an acre than farmers did.   Members of environmental and breast-cancer groups said they also wanted a study of pesticides and other contaminants in water supplies. \"We simply don't think the water is safe,\" said Karen Wolk of the One in Nine Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940218","headline":"Review/Film; Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/movies/review-film-coming-of-age-in-snippets-life-as-a-twentysomething.html","abstract":"Aspiring 20-something filmmaker tracks down friends.

There's a $12 cover and an $8 minimum. P. W. Soul From the Quarter    Irma Thomas, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. New Orleans's own soul singer may be one of the greatest living female soul singers, along with Etta James and Aretha Franklin. The difference between Irma Thomas and the competition is simple: at her best, she is restrained, and her early singles are devoid of gospel inflections and still full of intensity. when she's in the mood, she can also be a great performer, one who can bring New Orleans right into your heart. Shows on Sunday night are at 8 and 11; there is a $15 cover charge. P.

The crisis on the Korean peninsula has been defused, but only temporarily. North Korea has agreed to comply with terms to which, in fact, it had already agreed in 1985. Meanwhile, there is the strong suspicion that the evidence of weapons production can be found elsewhere, dumped in two nuclear waste sites the North Koreans insist remain off-limits, in the name of national sovereignty. And of course there is the legitimate fear that the inspections will come too late, that North Korea already has its bomb.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940219","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/19/arts/classical-music-in-review-236390.html","abstract":"  Diamond Concert  92d Street Y","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940219","headline":"Chinese Trace Claim On Tibet to Mongols","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/19/opinion/l-chinese-trace-claim-on-tibet-to-mongols-239941.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Pan Xinliang, managing director of China Travel Service, writes (letter, Feb. 5) that Tibet \"became part of China during the Tang Dynasty between A.D. 618 and 907.\" This is incorrect.

A bluegrass bounce carried songs by Grateful Dead; the narrative style of mountain ballads was harnessed to non-linear visions. The homey feeling of major chords and foursquare rhythms provided something secure in a disorienting new territory.    Blind Melon and the Meat Puppets, two neo-psychedelic bands who shared a sold-out bill at Roseland on Thursday night, ground free-form musings with a rural touch.
