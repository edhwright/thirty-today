Half buried in its electronic moans and swirls lay the tinny recorded voice of Mayakovsky himself, deliberately muffled and distorted and offering the impression of a suppressed personality wanting to be let out.   In much the same way, Mayakovsky's presence on Friday at Lehman College in the Bronx was more or less muffled by another Russian poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who for several hours ate up the stage with extroverted poetry readings (mostly poems by Mr. Yevtushenko), loud asides and athletic, audience-milking shtick. Through the haze of bombast, traces of Mayakovsky's striking imagination did seep into view. The poet died in 1930 and left behind some of the century's most interesting and extravagant imagery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/sports/transactions-952093.html","abstract":"  Basketball  National Basketball Association   NBA -- Fined John Starks and the New York Knicks $5,000 each for a flagrant foul Starks committed against Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers in a playoff game Tuesday night.

He sliced two-fifths of a second off the record of 1:33 set in 1982 by Conquistador Cielo, who was carrying only 111 pounds at the time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Books of The Times; The View Depends On Where You Stand","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/books/books-of-the-times-the-view-depends-on-where-you-stand.html","abstract":"  Eclipse Fever  By Walter Abish  335 pages.

Paula Vogel, the author of \"The Baltimore Waltz,\" scrutinizes this provocative issue in \"And Baby Makes Seven,\" which opened last night at the Lucille Lortel Theater. In the play, a menage a trois awaits the imminent birth of a baby. The expectant mother (Cherry Jones) is a lesbian who wants to have a child, but without the complications of questions of paternity. The father (Peter Frechette) is gay, and the third character is the mother's lover (Mary Mara). The pregnancy begins as an act of pragmatism, but the relationships become more intricate as the three continue to live together. Their spacious New York City loft becomes a hothouse environment.   Deep within this discursive play is an untapped story of emotional alliances that transcend matters of sexual identity. Such thoughts and others are submerged in a Gothic nursery tale gone awry. Instead of exploring her characters, the playwright falls back on children's games. Together, the women have a flourishing fantasy life, in which they pretend to be children. In her fantasy, Ms. Jones becomes a proper English schoolboy, Cecil, and Ms. Mara doubles (or is it triples?) as the French youngster in the movie \"The Red Balloon\" and as a mischievous sprite named Orphan McDermott.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930507","headline":"Nostalgia and Sciatica Move to Center Court","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/sports/tennis-nostalgia-and-sciatica-move-to-center-court.html","abstract":"  So I told the cabdriver, \"Take me to the 69th Regiment Armory, in the spring of 1968,\" and suddenly I was watching people who looked like Muscles and Emmo and the Rocket play a game that looked like tennis the way it oughta be.

There are gloriously bizarre surprises hidden in the English phase of Alfred Hitchcock's career, those early days when he was scarcely a gleam in Hollywood's eye. Among the oddities from the 1930's are: a killer who turns out to be a cross-dressing trapeze artist; a wry comedy about marriage in which no one comes close to being murdered, and more toy trains than you've seen since childhood. And though Hitchcock went to Hollywood for good in 1939, he returned to England near the end of World War II to make the strangest movies of his career: two French-language propaganda films of such cynicism and double-agentry that they might end war altogether. After watching these shorts, no one could possibly figure out who was fighting whom, much less whom to trust.    \" 'Cocky' in Britain: The Early Alfred Hitchcock\" is the too-too-clever title of the delicious series that begins today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. \"Cocky\" refers to the director's boyhood nickname as well as his thumb-your-nose attitude, but while the title's peculiar British ring is jarring, it does make sense. The series follows Hitchcock as he moves away from his Cockney background toward Hollywood, a process that transformed him from Cocky to Hitch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930507","headline":"Review/City Ballet; Counting Down: 73 Works","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/arts/review-city-ballet-counting-down-73-works.html","abstract":"  The New York City Ballet began its survey of 73 ballets by George Balanchine in earnest on Wednesday night.

They seem to have taken from France only the surface of what Picasso and Braque had invented: a vocabulary of folded, angular forms that made the Czechs' designs for buildings and furniture look weird and agitated without being fully Cubist in their reorganization of space.

Born in 1938, the son of Muslim Tatars, he grew up in Ufa, a small town between Moscow and Siberia. His childhood is recalled in terms of Dickensian poverty.

This quietly inspiring joint exhibition includes some seldom-seen paintings from the 1950's that attest to the couple's shared interest in diverting the formal means of Abstract Expressionism toward more narrative ends: she toward shrouded images of goddesslike females, he toward even more primal shamanistic motifs. But the show's real news resides in the impressive recent efforts by the two artists, which indicate that their mutual influence may be at a new high.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930507","headline":"Political Memo; Hillary Clinton Is Back!

Unless he fixes his attention on the key items -- the economy, health care, ethics legislation -- Congress and public will begin to wander. So far, his vaulting legislative ambitions have produced an agenda so loaded with worthy ideas that it's in danger of stopping dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930508","headline":"Investigation Of Missing Art Is Narrowed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/08/nyregion/investigation-of-missing-art-is-narrowed.html","abstract":"  The mystery of Paterson's missing art got a little less murky today.

It will close the doors this summer of its long-running boxing department, once renowned for helping make the Garden synonymous with the sport, starting in the Joe Louis era 60 years ago. The Garden could still stage fights by licensed outside promoters, but these bouts will be booked by the same department that schedules events that range from rock concerts to the Westminster Dog Show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930508","headline":"Review/Pop; A Concert Like a Reunion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/08/arts/review-pop-a-concert-like-a-reunion.html","abstract":"  Few pop divas have as devout a cult following as Nina Simone, who made a rare New York appearance last Saturday evening at the Beacon Theater. To the faithful, Ms. Simone's visits are not just concerts but ceremonial reunions at which \"the high priestess of soul\" returns from a self-imposed exile to bless her flock and to refresh her own sense of self-worth. During one especially boisterous round of acclaim at the Beacon, she stoked the applause by gesturing for more and demanding: \"Feed me!  Feed me! I need it!\"    The ceremony would be ludicrous were Ms. Simone not an astonishingly dramatic performer. When she feels comfortable and appreciated, as she did at the Beacon, she can take a familiar song and virtually reinvent it, sometimes by interpolating her own lyrics, to turn it into an intense, often troubling personal journey. The drama comes from the volatile mix of Ms. Simone's deep, rumbling voice, her elegant classical pianism and her mercurial temperament. A brooding ballad can suddenly explode with anger. An exultant cry of delight can just as suddenly crack with pain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930508","headline":"Gowanus Expressway Should Be Demolished, Not Rebuilt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/08/opinion/l-gowanus-expressway-should-be-demolished-not-rebuilt-571893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I have been following with interest and dismay the public discussion on Brooklyn's Gowanus Expressway reconstruction.
