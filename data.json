The $1.5 billion the I.M.F. has promised -- after months of delay -- is much too little to turn the economy around. But the agreement is still crucial because it paves the way for Russia to receive other international help.

NEW YORK CITY  TUNNEL DWELLER SEEKS THE LIGHT   Homeless, stoned and dirty, Bob Kalinski hit bottom in 1986. Then he went deeper, into the dark. For eight years he lived underground in a train tunnel. He came out only in the early morning when most of the city was asleep, to pick up aluminum cans to sell for food. Now, after more than 2,000 nights under a concrete sky, he realizes that the only thing he found down deep in the Amtrak tunnel at 95th Street and Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side was a place to hide. B3. A BITTER BUSINESS COMMISSIONER   Rudy Washington, New York City's new Commissioner of Business Services, sat in his spacious downtown office in the Battery Maritime Building recently and mused -- sometimes bitterly -- about the three months since he left the world of entrepreneurship and joined ranks with the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, describing it as a period both confounding and arduous. B3. MAYOR SAYS CITY IS NOT MORE DANGEROUS   After visiting a hospitalized British man who was wounded at his midtown hotel on Saturday in the second shooting of tourists in four days, Mayor Giuliani tried to allay fears by saying he did not believe New York City was getting more dangerous for tourists. In Saturday afternoon's shooting, Peter Cooper, 46, of Bournemouth, Dorset, was shot in the left shoulder when he encountered a burglar. B3. REGION  FILES CHECKED IN BLAST INQUIRY  Combing through decades of records, Federal investigators began trying to pinpoint when there was construction activity around an asphalt plant in Edison, N.J., that may have caused a gas pipeline to burst last week, in a thunderous explosion and fireball. The investigators were seeking to capitalize on their discovery on Saturday that fragments of the pipeline found near the Durham Woods apartments had deep scratches that may have been made by construction equipment. B4. MINORITY DISTRICTS PART OF NASSAU PLAN   The creation of two minority-dominated districts is at the heart of a plan for a new 19-member Nassau County Legislature that is meant to assure fair representation for Long Island's growing number of minority residents. A preliminary map outlining the 19 districts is expected to be adopted in East Meadow by a county commission. B4. TEEN IN SHOOTING CASE ARRESTED   Howard Caesar, a Newark teen-ager whose shooting by a police officer after a carjacking led to an investigation of police handling of the incident, was arrested with four other Newark residents after a carjacking and spree of robberies and shootings, the police said. Mr. Caesar, 19, was being held on charges of carjacking, aggravated assault of a police officer, and several counts of aggravated assault, possession of a handgun, possession of a handgun for unlawful purposes and other charges. B4. NEW TRIAL FOR TROOPER IN TAMPERING CASE   A New York State police investigator who was acquitted on evidence tampering charges last year is scheduled to go on trial on charges that he faked fingerprint evidence in a separate case. The trooper, David M. Beers, who was assigned to the criminal investigation unit of Troop C in Sidney, is accused of fabricating fingerprint evidence in a 1991 narcotics and weapons case. B5.

These are songs Iago might have liked.   Schumann's Opus 39 cycle, his second \"Liederkreis,\" expands on the bleak world of Schubert's \"Winterreise.\" The poems by Josef von Eichendorff draw on conventional idyllic images of German Romanticism, but a layer of dread hovers over them. Even the glacial serenity of \"Mondnacht,\" married to one of Schumann's greatest melodic inspirations, is marked by an \"as if\" locution that gives its contentment an unreal sheen. \"Zwielicht,\" close to the end of the cycle, is a harrowing cry of paranoid pain; Schumann's tonally disconnected harmonies deepen the horror.

Now teachers, they still live in a tiny apartment in Beijing more suited to students than adults, and are stymied about the future. Xiaodong is an intense-looking man, with large glasses and a roomful of paints and canvases. But as the narrator says, \"He dreamed of nothing but being rich,\" and the fantasy paralyzed him. \"He couldn't even paint.\" Xiaochun is so ready to leave the relationship and the country that she writes to relatives in New York and hopes to join them.   The film is most intruiging when it becomes a window on aspects of Chinese culture rarely depicted on screen. Some early-morning sex between Xiaodong and Xiaochun is discreet by American standards, but the scene is long and emphatic enough to be unusual in a Chinese film. And at times \"The Days\" effectively suggests the tension between an awful past that the characters want to forget and a present that seems cut off from all meaning. Xiaochun's parents had been persecuted by her entire school when she was 16.

The Clinton Administration argues that the U.S. should resume aid to Pakistan and deliver the F-16 fighters Pakistan paid for but never received -- if it first agrees to a verifiable ban on the production of nuclear material and halts its missile programs. Opponents in Congress say that such inducements have not worked. The Administration is right to try again. But it needs to persuade India to go along; India insists it will not accept any deal that does not impose restraints on China as well as Pakistan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940329","headline":"At Least 31 Killed in Gun Battles in Johannesburg","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/29/world/at-least-31-killed-in-gun-battles-in-johannesburg.html","abstract":"  Gun battles rattled incongruously through the high-rise canyons of downtown Johannesburg today as a protest by Zulu nationalists opposed to elections degenerated into the deadliest melee the city could remember.

Like similar measures already on the books in New Jersey, Connecticut and six other states, the overdue law would bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, education and credit.    Since the vast majority of Senate Democrats support the bill, there is a good chance it will also pass the Senate.

The question was whether Federal judges have the power to grant stays of execution to inmates who have exhausted their state appeals but have not found lawyers to help them file an initial petition for Federal court review. A majority of the Justices were visibly disturbed when the lawyer for the State of Texas argued that Federal judges did not have such power. Shortages and Difficulties    The Court was hearing the appeal of a convicted murderer, Frank B. McFarland, who came within hours of execution by Texas in November after two lower Federal courts refused his request for a stay. The courts held that they had no jurisdiction over any aspect of the case until the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the document that initiates Federal court review of a state conviction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940330","headline":"Note to Readers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/opinion/note-to-readers.html","abstract":"  The Op-Ed page welcomes unsolicited manuscripts.
