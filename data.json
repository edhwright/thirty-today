Paul (Francois Cluzet) owns a hotel by a serene lake. He marries the beautiful Nelly (Emmanuelle Beart), they have a son, and soon Paul begins hearing voices in his head that tell him Nelly is unfaithful. \"L'Enfer\" (\"Hell\") works best in its early stages, when it is clear that Paul is losing his mind but unclear just what Nelly might be up to. She does, after all, have a blase sex appeal and a hotelful of men to choose from. Paul catches her in the dark, watching slides with a muscular guest. And she has lied about how much she paid for a cute new handbag, so what else has she lied about? Attached to Paul's point of view, we never catch Nelly in a compromising situation, but that doesn't mean she's innocent.    The film's pedigree encourages these suspicions. Mr. Chabrol, the New Wave veteran and the director of the recent \"Madame Bovary,\" also has a taste for stylish thrillers. And he has adapted the script from one written by Henri-Georges Clouzot, who directed \"Diabolique,\" the classic story in which a man's wife and mistress team up to murder him. Clouzot, in fact, started to film \"L'Enfer\" in 1964, but abandoned it when the lead actor and then he himself became ill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941019","headline":"IN PERFORMANCE: THEATER","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/19/theater/in-performance-theater-575860.html","abstract":"  Link Between 4 Monologues: The Drone of a Dying Bee Performance Space 122    The waning drone of a dying bee links the four monologues that make up \"Of Mice, Bugs and Women,\" an engaging performance piece by Deb Margolin, which may be seen tomorrow through Sunday at Performance Space 122 (150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village).

As an artist, he has been remarkably deep and original.   At the same time, his work, with its dramatic reading of 20th-century music (especially by Stravinsky and the composers of Mr. Kylian's native Czechoslovakia) heralded a dance expressionism in the 1970's that stood out against the formal experiments of the time.

At the core of the plan is a tax dodge. If the state were to buy Lilco from its shareholders, the utility would no longer owe Federal taxes and could borrow at tax-free -- therefore low -- interest rates. Lilco could use the low-cost loans to buy back shares, thereby eliminating dividends, and to replace existing high-cost loans. The potential saving is huge because Lilco is buried in debt, in part because it built a $5.5 billion nuclear plant, Shoreham, which it never opened in the face of ferocious opposition from nearby residents and, well, Governor Cuomo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941020","headline":"Discipline Meets Show Biz, Amicably","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/arts/dance-review-discipline-meets-show-biz-amicably.html","abstract":"  One of the most popular dance groups on the national circuit, surprisingly, did not make its Manhattan debut until Tuesday night.

Yeltsin and his aides got the dinner jackets they wore at the state banquet for Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday, the first black-tie affair in the Kremlin since 1917.   The Communists not only put a stop to formal wear, but also murdered the Russian royal family, and that has put something of a pall on relations with Britain and its royal family ever since. Czar Nicholas II was a first cousin of King George V of Britain and the Russian state archives are full of handwritten letters from the King addressed to \"Nicky\" and signed \"Georgie.\" They are full of affection and concern for the problems of an increasingly chaotic pre-revolutionary Russia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941020","headline":"Independent Votes Hold Key to 8th District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/nyregion/the-1994-campaign-new-jersey-independent-votes-hold-key-to-8th-district.html","abstract":"  Both Herb Klein and Bill Martini are lawyers who live in Clifton.

Mr. Martini's Commercial    PRODUCER -- Dave Murray Associates, Princeton, N.J.    ON THE SCREEN -- The 30-second ad first features pictures of Mr. Klein, former Gov. Jim Florio and President Clinton; beneath them are the words \"The Tax and Spend Way.\" Meanwhile, an announcer says: \"It's clear their way isn't working anymore. Bill Martini can do better.\" The next scene is that of a fund-raiser attended by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Sheriff Edwin Englehardt of Passaic County, one of the party's most popular local figures; under Mrs. Whitman's picture are the words \"Martini will cut taxes.\" And the Governor is heard saying, \"We need Bill Martini in Congress to cut spending, to cut taxes, to end politics as usual.\"   ANALYSIS -- The familiar \"tax and spend\" label that Republicans use against Democratic opponents has become such a campaign cliche that it defies examination. The unspoken message: guilt by association. Mr. Klein's Commercial   PRODUCER -- Fenn, King, Murphy Communications, Washington.   ON THE AIR -- The 60-second ad features an announcer who sounds like a carnival pitchman saying, \"Stand up, Bill, you won the doozy for talking about cutting spending in Congress even though you, Bill Martini, know how to waste money better than anyone in New Jersey. You voted to approve $23 million in cost overruns on the county administration building. Originally budgeted at $15 million, now it will cost taxpayers over $100 million, including interest. Now that's a doozy. And that's why you, Bill Martini, are the winner of the lifetime doozy award.\"   ANALYSIS -- The \"doozy ad\" is an effort to throw the \"tax and spend\" charge right back at Mr. Martini.   But Mr. Martini wasn't even on the Passaic County Board of Freeholders when the project was first discussed in 1988, or when it was designed or put out to bid.    \"In fact, when I joined the board in January 1993, the building was already 85 percent completed,\" he said.    And despite the fact that the site had some unexpected environmental problems that contributed to its final $38 million cost, the entire project's overrun was less than 4 percent, he said.   Mr. Klein, of course, is gambling that even if voters hear both sides of the story, what they will remember when they get in the voting booth is something about Mr. Martini and a project that ended up costing millions.

Now, at Caffe Lure, north of Houston Street, Mr. Iacovelli has done it again.   But while Jean-Claude is a thoroughly Gallic establishment, Caffe Lure is, as the name indicates, part Italian and part, well, fish hook. That is, the focus is on seafood, which is evident the minute you walk in. Old advertisements for fish lures paper the walls, fish hooks hang from the molding above the kitchen door, and a sail is furled above the arch dividing the small room on the left from the bright main room.

Mr. Hampton's shows at the Blue Note are real occasions, a rare chance to hear music performed by masters, with not a weak link in the bunch. Though there are be-boppers in the group, the solos are short and precise, all played with the sort of relaxation that informs the best swing sessions. Mr. Hampton will be host to Sweets Edison, Al Grey, James Moody, Benny Golson and others, and he will try to outplay them all. Shows tonight through Sunday night are at 9 and 11:30.

It's a real guitar thrill of a show, as both bands feature similar spidery playing. Tomorrow's concert features Tabu Ley Rochereau, the Zairian singer, whose band can make a club go wild.

The band also features the trumpeter Tim Hagans, a fine improviser with a bristling attack.

Contained within the curves and angled planes of her oddly shaped canvases are figures and objects: hands, babies, tables, coffee cups, palettes, brushes. It can take a while to decode them. They are nominally abstracted forms in flux, props in mostly domestic dramas of a psychological intensity and tenderness sometimes belied by the jazzy colors that Ms. Murray prefers. Her works suggest motion, fluidity. They're full of demotic shapes drawn from the comics (she thought of becoming a commercial artist when she was young). But they're also linked with painters like Cezanne, Miro, Klee, Johns and de Kooning.   Ms. Murray is a trim woman with frizzled white hair. She is warm, down to earth and modest. Her voice is soft. But her attitude, though gentle, is energetic and assured. She's tireless. On a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, her eye is arrested by one unexpected thing or another, and she becomes rapt. She moves while looking at a work, so the act of seeing is physical and alive. She speaks with conviction, despite her solicitousness. She talks reverently about the craft of painting, about the transformative ability of pigment on canvas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941021","headline":"U.S.-North Korea Accord Has a 10-Year Timetable","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/world/us-north-korea-accord-has-a-10-year-timetable.html","abstract":"  The new accord between the United States and North Korea outlines an elaborate timetable for steps by each side that would end in the complete dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program in about 10 years, according to details released today.

The performance at the Metropolitan Opera was extraordinary: supple, sometimes sexy and often achingly beautiful. As the characters passed from bewilderment to understanding, the word enlightenment, often associated with this work and its era, took on a literal meaning.   Some of these pleasures came from the unveiling of a new voice at the Met, belonging to the Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel. Last summer, in Salzburg, Austria, he combined lyrical gifts, comic timing and virile energy as Leporello in \"Don Giovanni,\" a role he will bring to the Met next month. But this performance of Figaro was of a different order. It justified the sense of occasion in the house itself, where 75 of Mr. Terfel's Welsh friends and family members joined listeners from more local, less rural regions, who came not just for Mozart but for the spiritedness this singer brings to this music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941021","headline":"Restaurants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/arts/restaurants-594091.html","abstract":"  Each time an Italian restaurant opens in New York City, the owners have to come up with a compelling reason for customers to patronize their establishment instead of the 2,200 other Italian restaurants in town.

Its outstanding visual chronicler was Juan Manuel Blanes (1830-1901), who was born and trained in Montevideo.

Take, for example, two pitch-black comedies by the Spanish director Luis Garcia Berlanga that are included in the series Spanish Eyes III: Classics of the Spanish Cinema, 1960-1975, which opens today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. On the surface, both films, which were made during the waning years of the Franco dictatorship, don't seem particularly political. But peel away the humor, and you will find acerbic critiques of Spanish culture under Franco in which the bitterness is masked by farcical loquacity and absurdism.    Mr. Berlanga's 1961 film, \"Placido,\" which begins a six-night engagement this evening, is a chattery comedy about an impoverished man who spends the day before Christmas trying to avoid foreclosure on his motorbike. The character's frantic dealings with bankers and lawyers are set against the film's satirical canvas of a provincial town putting on a showy Christmas campaign called \"Seat a Poor Man at Your Table.\" With its harshly funny portrait of the penny-pinching gentry, of greedy nuns and aggressive salespeople pushing pressure cookers as miraculous kitchen tools, the film offers a scabrously mocking portrait of officialdom putting on a display that is as grotesque as it is hypocritical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941021","headline":"Drowning Suit Award Reversed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/nyregion/drowning-suit-award-reversed.html","abstract":"  On a hot July night nine years ago, a group of seven people who had been out drinking squeezed through a hole in a chain link fence to get into a municipal pool in the Bronx, joining about 100 others who had also broken in and were already in the water.

At a boys' school in a Paris suburb, it's hard to know whom the mean-spirited principal mistreats more: his sweet, pigtailed wife, a brunette fresh from the convent (Vera Clouzot, the director's real-life wife) or his hard-as-nails blond mistress (Simone Signoret), dangling a cigarette from her mouth. Both women teach at the school, and form an unlikely friendship when they conspire to murder their lover.    That's just the start of the story, whose twists shouldn't be revealed. Nothing will ever replace the jolt of seeing \"Diabolique\" for the first time. It's enough to say that the murder is easy; getting rid of the body is hard. Keep your eye on the big wicker trunk the women take on a trip and don't be surprised at anything that does or doesn't turn up at the bottom of the school's filthy swimming pool. As the women wait to see if they got away with murder, Clouzot focuses on the effects of a bad conscience as much as on the trail of clues, and that pervasive sense of guilt raises the film beyond the level of a simple murder mystery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941021","headline":"Vietnam:Determined to Be a Tiger but in Need of Help","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/opinion/IHT-vietnamdetermined-to-be-a-tiger-but-in-need-of-help.html","abstract":"Eight months after President Bill Clinton lifted the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam, Washington and Hanoi are moving rapidly toward a new relationship.

And nearly 9 out of 10 incumbents who sought re-election won.   To John Bonifaz, a 28-year-old Boston lawyer consumed by the nexus between private money and politics, those numbers are not just unfair. They are also positively unconstitutional, he says, a barrier to free and equal participation in public life as high and wide as poll taxes, excessive filing fees or all-white primaries in the segregated South.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941021","headline":"A Premature Prize for Mideast Peace?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/opinion/l-a-premature-prize-for-mideast-peace-596094.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"A Prize to Encourage Mideast Peace\" (editorial, Oct. 15), supporting the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasir Arafat, notes that in 1973 the prize was awarded to Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, who had also engaged in past warfare. But Le Duc Tho refused the prize, on the ground that the Vietnam war had not yet ended, United States troops were still occupying his country, and killing by both sides was continuing.
