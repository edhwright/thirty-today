In Spain, the 71-year-old artist is revered as the country's greatest living painter and eminence grise, an artist who weathered the cultural and political drought of the Franco regime without compromising his work. A long list of museum retrospectives attests to the great esteem he inspires throughout Europe.   Mr. Tapies, who was born and has lived nearly all his life in Barcelona, has exhibited regularly in New York City since 1953. His big relieflike paintings, whose pocked and textured surfaces, built up with marble dust and incorporating incised words and symbols and sometimes found objects, suggest ancient urban walls. They are well known here. Yet his work has been overshadowed: by American Abstract Expressionism, by Pop and Minimalism, and also by a parade of his fellow Europeans, from Yves Klein and Joseph Beuys to newer arrivals like Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter and Georg Baselitz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Molissa Fenley Benefit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/theater/molissa-fenley-benefit.html","abstract":"  Philip Glass, Anthony Davis, Diamanda Galas and Stephen Petronio are among the musicians and dancers who are to perform at 8 P.M.  tomorrow at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, in a benefit for Molissa Fenley, the choreographer and dancer.

Three months ago, they opened their second restaurant, Negril Island Spice, in an equally difficult location, 23d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, where restaurants seem to go as quickly as they come.   Like the tiny first restaurant, the roomier Negril Island Spice shimmers with Caribbean vibrations.

Cuomo and Ann Richards PRODUCER    BBDO, New York City, for Frito-Lay Inc. VISUAL    With the mournful strains of Auld Lang Syne as background music, the scene opens with Mr. Cuomo helping Ms. Richards pack up her gubernatorial office. As she tosses file folders into a cardboard box, they begin to philosophize about the nature of change. When it becomes clear that the change they are discussing is packaging - of tortilla chips, not candidates - Ms. Richards pulls out a newly designed bag of Doritos and Mr. Cuomo begins to munch on a few. SCRIPT    Ms. Richards: \"Mario, I haven't seen a change like this since I was knee high to a June bug.\"    Mr. Cuomo: \"Ann, I was as surprised as you are.\"    A.R.: \"Well, I should have seen it coming.\"    M.C.: \"Maybe so, but now I think we ought to accept this change, embrace it, be positive about it, because change can be very exciting.\"    A.R.: \"You're probably right, Mario. I guess I'll get used to Doritis' new bag.\"    M.C.: \"There you go.\"    Anouncer: \"This year's big change is Doritos. more great taste, brand-new bag.\"    M.C.: \"Too bad about the Cowboys, Ann.\"    A.R.: \"They always won when I was Governor.\" ACCURACY    It is true that both Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Richards are surprised by change. Both thought until the last minute that they would win their elections on Nov. 8. But as is her wont, Ms. Richards is waxing a bit hyberbolic with her assertion that she has not seen such change since she was knee high to a June bug (a large scarab). She has lived through the decline of the beehive hairdo, the Texas oil bust and the stunning emergence of salsa as America's biggest-selling condiment. Mr. Cuomo's advice that change should be embraced is equally suspect. He is, after all, planning to write a book attacking Newt Gingrich's Contract With America as \"plastic populism.\"    Ms. Richards is trying to pull a fast one with her attempt to distance herself from the Dallas Cowboys' loss this year to the San Francisco 49'ers in the National Football Conference title game. Her successor, George W. Bush, was not sworn in until Jan. 17, two days after the game. But Mr. Cuomo has lttle standing to rib Ms. Richards about the Cowboys. His team of choice, the Buffalo Bills lost the Super Bowl each year of Mr. Cuomo's third term, including twice to the Cowboys. SCORECARD    As polticians, these two were always better at belittling their opponents than themselves. During last year's campaign, Mr. Cuomo called the current Governor of New York a \"liar\", while Ms. Richards referred to the current Governor of Texas as a \"jerk.\" But defeat seems to have taught them a lesson, even if the lesson is that a big corporate fee makes self-depreciation far easier to swallow. If this ad helps move Doritos, Frito-Lay may have found the talent it has searched for to replace Dan Quayle, the star of last year's Super Bowl ad for Wavy Lay's potato chips. Expect to see Mr. Cuomo extolling the virtues of \"the family of Fritos\" and Ms. Richards reminding viewers that she was born with a silver chop in her mouth.

Arab workmen labor busily behind him as he speaks.   Confronted by the thorny questions that his settlement-building work raises, the man contradicts himself freely.

Somehow the technology did not fail me on Wednesday; here, then, an experiment in parallax reviewing.

Mr. Ma has played the Dvorak more times than he probably cares to count, and his warmly effusive interpretation is by now well known. Wednesday's performance, on first hearing, seemed only modestly successful.

Desperate crapshooters are a hoot, but scheming executives ogling secretaries who are setting man traps are nowadays as likely to evoke litigation as laughter. Has the show been updated for the times? Well, in snapshot interviews after the numbers, it depended on whom you asked.   Hedy La Rue, the boss's floozy, is Luba Mason, who says she plays the role in a smarter, more sophisticated way than it was played in the 1967 movie, which she saw. When the junior suits drool, Ms. Mason fires a look that lets them know they're disgusting. When things work out professionally for Finch and maritally for her, she gives him a thumbs-up to signal that they were cleverly in cahoots all along.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/style/chronicle-240095.html","abstract":"  Who was that corpse marching across the stage?

The dust-up that followed made Mr. Serrano an instant political hero in some quarters and helped send Federal arts financing spiraling down the drain.   Overnight sensations usually look different in the cool light of day, and Mr. Serrano is no exception. The artist on view in \"Andres Serrano: Works 1983-1993,\" a retrospective at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, is not a political firebrand; in fact, the issue-oriented work on view looks surprisingly sparkless. What he is is an artist quick to tackle big themes while staying shy of their complexities, an impressive technician and a moralist whose roots lie less in contemporary theory than in the Roman Catholicism of his childhood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950127","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/arts/art-in-review-412895.html","abstract":"  'Fields of Vision'  'The Art of Sotho Habitation'   Miriam and Ira D.

But the group distributed a flier, bearing the title \"Guilty of Crimes Against Humanity,\" that gave the names and addresses of 12 doctors who perform abortions, describing them as \"The Deadly Dozen.\" This has an uncomfortable resemblance to a hit list; several of the doctors had already been displayed (as were the two murdered physicians) on \"wanted\" posters.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950128","headline":"Rabin Renews Denunciation of Settlers as 'Burden'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/world/rabin-renews-denunciation-of-settlers-as-burden.html","abstract":"  While his Government approves new settlement construction in the West Bank, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has renewed his harsh attacks on settlers, denouncing them as \"a burden\" on the Israeli Army and on its fight against radical Palestinian terrorists.    \"Settlements add nothing, absolutely nothing, to Israel's security,\" Mr. Rabin told members of his Labor Party on Thursday night. \"They are a liability rather than an asset.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950128","headline":"A Stock Tip (Hint: It Has Big Ears)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/your-money/IHT-a-stock-tip-hint-it-has-big-ears.html","abstract":"THIS week, a departure from this column's normal practice.

For a pianist, keeping both elements in focus is as important as negotiating Mr. Rzewski's assertive language, and although he has quite a few champions, Ursula Oppens has been one of the most eloquent. On Wednesday evening at the Miller Theater, Ms. Oppens and Mr. Rzewski, who is also a formidable pianist, joined forces in a program of music for two pianos.    Only the second half of the program was devoted to Mr. Rzewski's works. The pianists opened the program with Arnold Schoenberg's peculiar but fascinating arrangement of his own \"Kammersymphonie No. 2.\" At first the comparatively dry piano sound seemed irreconcilably foreign to this lushly orchestrated score. But the sharply articulated piano writing yielded surprises and clarifications, including a Bachian quality -- a rhythmically steady chromatic probing -- that is virtually undiscernible in the orchestral version.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950128","headline":"A 'Happy Lunar New Year' Next Week","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/opinion/l-a-happy-lunar-new-year-next-week-541395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    The so-called Chinese New Year, which this year falls on Jan. 31, comes about one month after the Western New Year.

The 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty, the bulwark of U.S. efforts to stop the spread of nuclear arms, comes up for review in April. Signed by 168 nations, the treaty has helped keep nuclear power programs from being used to make arms and was a factor in persuading South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Ukraine to give up their nuclear arms or arms-making.

Her hair a dusty shade of blond and her face a study in seraphic contentment, Ms. Woodward brings a quality of arrested girlishness to Abby Brewster, one of a pair of do-gooding, geriatric sisters whose hobby is killing off lonely old men. She seems to exist in her own golden haze, nodding her head as if the world were a litany of lovely reassurances to which she can only agree. And when she moves, it's with a strange, scuttling gait, somewhere between a skip and a canter, that bespeaks infinite enthusiasm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950128","headline":"1920: Flu Deaths Down : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/28/opinion/IHT-1920-flu-deaths-down-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW YORK - There have been only 1,712 new cases of influenza reported during the past twenty- four hours.

Mayor Giuliani, too, met strong opposition, and the Housing Police are still battling in court.

But theater size isn't everything. This season, \"Girl Gone\" was an Off Off Broadway show for six weeks, as Off Off was defined by its Actors' Equity contract.

I first read Angus Wilson when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the late 1950's. Nobody had recommended him: I found him for myself. \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\" had appeared in a Penguin paperback in 1958, and maybe this was the novel that introduced him to me -- or maybe it was a volume of short stories, or his first novel, \"Hemlock and After,\" also available in Penguin. However I came upon him, I rapidly read my way through all that was available, and began to wait eagerly for the next volume. I can remember to this day the sheer physical pleasure of sitting on the flat roof outside my tower room at Newnham College, in the warm sunlight, when I should have been studying for some examination or other, reading Angus Wilson instead and knowing myself to be in the company of a master. When I got to the end of \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes,\" I wanted to begin reading the book all over again. And I have since read it many times, and always wished it were longer.\n\nThe excitement of discovery had a subversive element. Cambridge in the 1950's was heavily dominated by F. R. Leavis and his Great Tradition: we were more advanced than Oxford, for we were permitted -- indeed enjoined -- to read and admire D. H. Lawrence. But there all curiosity ended. We were not allowed to read on. Leavis's critical presence was so powerful in the university that it killed all but the most stubborn literary talent: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes survived, but many more withered, or took a diversionary leap sideways into drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Only Doubt Endures","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/books/only-doubt-endures.html","abstract":"  DEATH IN ROME  By Wolfgang Koeppen.

The most recent example is Dick Armey's reference to Representative Barney Frank, who is openly homosexual, as \"Barney Fag.\" Mr. Armey is the House majority leader, and we would have to go back to the days of Earl Butz to find a parallel example of such common behavior by a high Federal official.   His explanation that this was a \"stumbled word\" instead of \"an intentional personal attack\" is not supported in any way by the tape recording of his interview. He spoke with clear intent to defame a worthy opponent. In place of true contrition, Mr. Armey used a ranting speech on the House floor to denounce reporters for refusing to suppress his disgraceful on-the-record remarks made to interviewers assembled by Mr. Armey's staff with the express purpose of taping his words for broadcast. Even those who argue that Newt Gingrich's mother was sandbagged into criticizing the First Lady cannot defend Mr. Armey.

The deal did not signal an appreciation of the record business by the studio head: Reprise -- even with Mr. Sinatra on its roster -- was a loser. Rather, Warner's studio had recently enjoyed a hit with \"Ocean's 11,\" a Las Vegas caper film featuring the singer and several of his \"rat pack\" buddies, and the purchase of the label was part of a broader deal to tie up Mr. Sinatra as an actor. Even if Reprise continued to lose money, it was a cheap way of assuring that Mr. Sinatra would make movies for the studio -- a potential gold mine for Warner Brothers.   The deal did prove a gold mine, but not because of Frank Sinatra. Reprise gave Warner Brothers the services of a man whose ultimate value to the company over 31 years would dwarf Mr. Sinatra's: Mo Ostin.    At 68, the balding, bespectacled and low-key Mr. Ostin looks more like the controller he is by training than the monumental cultural visionary and business tactician he has proved to be. He stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of Warner Brothers Records on Dec. 31 after losing an unusually public corporate power struggle. But long after the dust of his departure has settled, Mr. Ostin's contribution to the record business will endure. Under his direction, Warner Brothers was transformed from a small, struggling label into the world's largest record company and the financial engine that drove Steve Ross's Warner Communications. Most significant, however, was the way Mr. Ostin achieved the transformation: by embracing the rock underground of the 60's when other, more conservative labels were loath to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"How I Survived Off Off Broadway: One Man's Tale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/how-i-survived-off-off-broadway-one-man-s-tale.html","abstract":"  WHEN Aunt Chiche went for her checkbook, I thought I had it made.

But when I went outside that circle of friends and played others, it turned from exercise into existentialism. I was on a team, yet felt abandoned and alone, running out for passes which never came, playing against opponents who couldn't see me. Was I really invisible? Maybe I simply didn't exist. If I keep going out for the ball and no one has any intention of throwing to me, then am I playing a lie?

There are good solid reasons for applying mulch after the first hard freeze. Your roses can distinguish between proper and improper mulching, which may show up in their performance next season.   Plant roots are found in approximately the top foot of soil for herbaceous plants and the top two feet for shrubs. The only reason for roots to grow lower is to find moisture, not for constant temperature. Mulch does not cause roots to grow deeper, but rather allows them to remain at their natural depth by retaining moisture in the upper levels of the soil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living In/Boerum Hill; Restoration in a Mixed Ethnic District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-living-boerum-hill-restoration-mixed-ethnic-district.html","abstract":"  FOR Michael Armstrong, a pioneering town house purchaser in the 60's, Boerum Hill was, when he first arrived, \"more than a conscious neighborhood, more like a state of mind.\"    \"We bought our house at 453 State Street in 1966, a 16-foot-wide four-floor rowhouse where we raised three kids,\" said Mr. Armstrong, spokesman for Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President. \"Before us, 30 people lived in this house.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"AIDS Patients in S.R.O.'s Will Not Be Relocated","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/l-aids-patients-in-sro-s-will-not-be-relocated-263095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The Jan. 22 article \"Pressured, City Quietly Cuts AIDS Patients in S.R.O.'s\" mischaracterizes the Giuliani Administration's plans to house people with AIDS in commercial S.R.O.'s in Manhattan Community Board 7.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Pasta and More","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/good-eating-pasta-and-more.html","abstract":"  ALLA SERA ++ (212) 717-5131; 1481 First Avenue, near 77th Street; $; all major credit cards","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Southwestern Snap Moves Into Westport","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/dining-out-southwestern-snap-moves-into-westport.html","abstract":"  WITH the arrival of the Durango Grill, it looks as though Westport finally has a winner and permanent occupant for a hillside location near the railroad station well known for revolving-door tenants.

But novelties are hard to come by. And now and then we must present them for reasons of prestige.\"   Weisgall's \"Temptation\" was never, of course, a free-standing work. It just provided the composer an opportunity to mock the attitudes of opera houses along with his own predilection for \"modern, tuneless stuff.\" He even includes an Expressionist, atonal aria about St. Anthony's pig. (\"It's lousy enough with the right notes,\" the Accompanist says as he corrects a singer's performance.) Mr. Weisgall also displays a gentle irony toward his own taste for serious religious themes; the portentousness of \"The Temptation\" is disrupted by six unnamed characters from another drama, who magically enter the opera company's \"real world.\" The result is a combination of styles ranging from opera buffa to verismo to musical comedy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"OUT OF ORDER;\nAll (Almost All) Hail the Megabookstore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/out-of-order-all-almost-all-hail-the-megabookstore.html","abstract":"AMERICAN business takes pride in delivering what consumers want when they want it -- snow shovels in January, sun hats in August and pizza all year-round.

Companies like Cunard and American Airlines are now lending their familiar emblems to targeted sales brochures.    The International Gay Travel Association now has 1,000 members, 65 percent of them travel agents, in the estimate of David Alport, the group's vice president, who is also the publisher of the gay travel newsletter Out & About. And last year, for the first time, the Gay Travel Association participated in the convention of the American Society of Travel Agents, held in Lisbon.    There is certainly a shakeout, too. Lorry Heverly, an agent in Baton Rouge, who went into business a year ago to serve gay and lesbian clients, said she actually put together one tour herself, a trip to New Orleans at Halloween, when the French Quarter turns into a vast masquerade. The program did not sell well, she said.   Asked about this apparent paradox -- an event that has been a natural sells badly as a package -- Billy Kolber, editor of Out & About, said that a number of companies new in the field assumed that listing a trip as an \"all-gay departure\" for, say, a safari would be enough. But operators and agents have found that this approach does not succeed, he said, because gay clients can be perfectly comfortable on a mainstream safari. At the other end of the spectrum, gay clients may not need a guided tour to an easygoing place like New Orleans or Key West. Tour content and assurances of acceptance in areas where gay couples may have been shunned are apparently better selling points.   The owners of Out & About, who say it has a circulation of 6,500, believe that much of the agent interest stems from a need to find loyal clients in hard times. \"Travel agents are delighted to find that this underserved community is so loyal,\" Mr. Kolber said. Out & About is published 10 times a year and a subscription costs $49 in the United States: 8 West 19th Street, Suite 401, New York, N.Y. 10011; (800) 929-2268 or (212) 645-6922.  Focus on 'Community'   When \"gay travel\" became heard in the mainstream world, probably about 1990, the term was presumed to include lesbians, or gay women. But some women began to feel invisible. All-women cruises are increasing, and Alaska is a prime destination.   Charlie Rounds, the new president of RSVP Travel Productions, which until now has aimed at gay men, said the company was offering three all-women cruises on Seaspirit, the company's 100-passenger vessel. One cruise, leaving Feb. 4 from St. Martin, calls at Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, St. Kitts and Nevis. Fares start at $995 in double occupancy. On April 30, the ship will embark on a seven-night cruise along the west coast of Costa Rica, with fares starting at $1,295 in double occupancy. Mr. Rounds said that a seven-night Alaska cruise, leaving July 8 from Juneau at the same fares as the Costa Rica cruise, was selling best and would probably sell out.    Even so, RSVP will not offer all-women or all-men cruises after this year. \"We will focus on community: all of us all the time,\" Mr. Rounds said. Taking his parents on the Seaspirit and seeing them treated royally by his fellow gay passengers, he said, taught him that diversity was the way to overcome prejudice. RSVP's trips are available only through travel agents. RSVP: 2800 University Avenue Southeast, Minneapolis, Minn. 55414; (800) 328-7787 or (612) 379-4697.   Meanwhile, Jan Cooper of Special Expeditions in New Jersey has scheduled a women's cruise in Alaska for July 30 to Aug. 6. Ms. Cooper said, \"We have been operating voyages in Alaska for over 13 years and this is a personal effort to bring women from all over the continental United States to meet with the women of Alaska.\" For this, Elfin Cove, a community run mostly by women because the men are out fishing, is a particular destination. The 70-passenger Sea Lion will sail from Sitka and return to Juneau. The fare, in double occupancy, ranges from $2,860 to $3,980. Special Expeditions: 123 South Avenue East, Westfield, N.J. 07090; (800) 348-2358 or (908) 654-0048.    Olivia Cruises and Resorts in Oakland, Calif., a company catering to lesbians, is offering a seven-night Alaska cruise departing from Seward, Alaska, or Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on June 21 aboard the Royal Cruise Line's Royal Odyssey, with a capacity of 750 passengers. Fares start at $1,595 in double occupancy. Other charter cruises offered by this company are aboard the Seabreeze in the Caribbean, departing April 9, and aboard the Regent Spirit, cruising the French and Italian Rivieras. The six-night fares in double occupancy start at $795 for the Caribbean and $1,895 for the Mediterranean. Since it began in 1990 as an offshoot of Olivia Records, the company has sold 16 charters, 3 in Club Med villages. Olivia: 4400 Market Street, Oakland, Calif. 94608; (800) 631-6277 or (510) 655-0364. Adventure Tours   Toto Tours of Chicago will operate 21 small-group adventure tours this year, having started with one in 1991. New trips include a 16-day yacht cruise of the Greek and Turkish islands, for men only, leaving Aug. 30; a trip to the Netherlands timed for the Queen's birthday at the end of April, which will include the ceremonies marking the liberation of the Netherlands in World War II, and a trip to New Zealand Feb. 15 to March 1, with an available extension to the Gay Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, the following week. Toto Tours: 1326 West Albion Avenue, 3W, Chicago, Ill. 60626; (312) 274-8686.   Pied Piper Travel in New York is in its fifth year of selling blocks of cabins on cruises to gay clients. This year it has three scheduled sailings on the Queen Elizabeth 2: April 27 for a trip from New York or Fort Lauderdale to Southhampton, England; May 15, a five-day cruise from New York to Bermuda and back, and July 3, a seven-day cruise from New York to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and back. The trans-Atlantic prices, which include return air fare, start at $1,696. Pied Piper: 330 West 42d Street, Suite 1601, New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 874-7312 or (212) 239-2412.   A new company is Our Family Abroad. It operated a short season of escorted tours in 1994. In 1995, it will offer 23, 11 of them in Europe. The tours are operated by Globus and are their standard trips, but they are kept separate from the others, according to Peter K. Schulze, Our Family Abroad's president. Specific brochures, maps and coupons are provided to his clients. He uses Globus escorts who have volunteered for his tours, he said, to avoid homophobic guides; they are given special training. The brochure says that the tours are \"discreet by design\" and the groups appear \"no different on the outside\" from the many others touring the world. Single-country tours of Costa Rica, Egypt, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal are offered, as well as multi-country tours. Our Family Abroad: 40 West 57th Street, Suite 430, New York, N.Y. 10019; (800) 999-5500 or (212) 459-1800.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"San Antonio","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/travel/l-san-antonio-197295.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: I had just returned from a conference in San Antonio when your article appeared.

EAKINS AND THE PHOTOGRAPH: Works by Thomas Eakins and His Circle in the Collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts/Smithsonian Institution, cloth, $80; paper, $34.95), by Susan Danly, a curator at the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College, and Cheryl Leibold, the archivist at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, catalogues the 648 Eakins prints and negatives held by the academy and examines the ways he used photography in his life and work. For Eakins, photography was a tool for teaching, for visual record keeping and exploration, but not an end in itself. Especially when compared to his powerful paintings, most of Eakins's photographs are less than remarkable. However, the large number of female and male nudes among his more conventional photographic images -- portraits of family and friends, snapshots of outings, picturesque scenes and farm animals -- attests to the originality of his methods. Eakins loathed polish and, when possible, chose students, friends, even himself for nude models to capture the awkwardness of real life. The book is a model of catalogue making -- attractive, thorough and richly informative.
