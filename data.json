I have climbed Split Rock light in Minnesota, perched above the sheer cliffs of Lake Superior, and enjoyed a panorama of San Diego harbor from the grounds of the Old Point Loma Lighthouse.   I was therefore somewhat skeptical about the lure of the Hudson's lights. They aren't as tall as most nor as famous. They aren't on puzzles or postage stamps or even in most travel books. But after recently visiting the four lighthouses open to the public, I was amply rewarded by stunning views of the river, the Palisades and the Catskills; one of the lighthouses, in Saugerties, even accommodates overnight guests.  Jeffrey's Hook   Known to millions as the \"Little Red Lighthouse\" because it is the subject of the children's classic \"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge,\" Jeffrey's Hook is the only lighthouse on Manhattan. Even so, many New Yorkers are surprised to discover it exists. The red cast-iron structure, on a spit of land jutting into the Hudson in Fort Washington Park, is dwarfed by the adjacent George Washington Bridge, about 15 times Little Red's height.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Deal and Discounts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/travel/travel-advisory-deal-and-discounts.html","abstract":"  IN GEAR IN SWITZERLAND The Kemwel Group and Swissair offer a fly-drive plan that combines a round-trip flight from New York or Boston to Geneva, Zurich or Basel with a week's car rental.

The critic's compositions are performed by leading orchestras, chamber musicians and singers around the country, sometimes with the composer conducting. When a new composition by this critic is presented in New York, another music critic from the paper reviews it, almost always favorably. After six years on the job, the critic wins a Pulitzer Prize, not for criticism but for composition. And far from being embarrassed, the editors of the paper boast in print of the critic's accomplishment.   Though unthinkable today, this was the situation of Virgil Thomson during his 14 years at The New York Herald Tribune. When he left the paper 40 years ago this fall, his career as composer and performer foundered for a time, and music criticism lost one of its perkiest, most provocative voices. Even those who devalue Thomson as a composer concede that he may have been the most brilliant music critic the United States has produced. Yet his appointment arose out of a singular set of circumstances that could not be duplicated today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Southwest Brooklyn Presses Its Economic Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-red-hook-gowanus-southwest-brooklyn-presses-its-economic.html","abstract":"  There are no greengrocers, no pharmacies, no bakeries in Red Hook.

But it would increase coverage above current rates and reform insurance laws so that ill people could not be discriminated against and workers could carry insurance from job to job. The plan is too flawed to be inspiring, but a bill based on this proposal is probably the only one the Senate can pass anytime soon.   The choice, then, is between passing something like the mainstream proposal and passing no bill at all. Because the proposal would do some good and no major harm, it is worth grabbing.

Within months he was on the road, making the best of things in places like Vermillion, S.D., and Rockingham, N.C. Facing down drunks and racist hecklers, he impressed audiences with his high-energy, edgy, observational humor. He joked about his childhood, being a parent, working, current events. He had one act for white audiences; another, edgier, for black clubs. Within five or six years Mr. Harvey was a headliner making $1,000 a week at big-city comedy clubs. Soon after, he was bringing in $2,500 a week playing resorts and performing regularly on pay-cable stand-up-comedy specials.   In short, his is a classic American success story -- or classic enough, anyway, for the talent-hungry executives who put together ABC's sitcom-heavy lineup.

It came in a handsome wooden box, and contained a rack for test tubes as well as niches where vials of powerful powders might be kept. There was a little packet of sensitive paper (litmus, I think), a knobbed glass rod, the obligatory manual, a metal loop for suspending a test tube over a flame, a conversion table (ounces into spoons) and suitably exciting poison labels. Dreams flew out of that box when its lid was lifted: dreams of bombs and poisons, of plots described in disappearing ink, of odors distressful to the weak. I set up a small lab in the basement and there I performed my experiments. \"Performed\" is the right word. \"Experiment\" is not. For I didn't follow the booklet where it led or listen to its lectures. I slopped about, blending yellow with white and obtaining brown, mixing crystals with powders and getting dust, combining liquids with solids and making mud.\n\nLater, in high school, I would take chemistry the way I took spring tonics and swallowed headache pills. Although I broke beakers and popped little pieces of potassium into puddles of water to watch the water fly, I did occasionally manage to obey tutorial instructions as well, repeating experiments that others had long ago undertaken. My predecessors had asked their questions of nature with genuine curiosity and awaited, like eager suitors, her reply. My method displayed a different spirit, which was to fudge my procedures in order to obtain the result already written in the chemmy books. I was not being taught to experiment or even to repeat experiments. I was being taught to cheat.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Dispute Snarls the Restoration of Astor Row","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-dispute-snarls-the-restoration-of-astor-row.html","abstract":"  Two years ago, city officials and preservationists, including Brooke Astor and then-Mayor David N.

Crammed with photographs of some of this country's most notorious gangsters -- including Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky and John Gotti -- the book unfortunately also comes with some banal and overheated prose by Sidney Zion. Mr. Zion, the author of \"The Autobiography of Roy Cohn\" and a columnist at The Daily News, should know better. Consider the following: \"On Oct. 23, 1935, Charles (the Bug) Workman strode into a Newark chophouse and ventilated the 33-year-old Schultz with hot lead.\" Or this: \"Of course, if the Combination\" -- the name the mob called itself in its early years -- \"had been running the country in the 30's instead of just feasting on it, Hitler would have been buried in his brown shirt the first time he showed up in a Berlin beer hall. And the Japanese warlords would have been whacked out by Murder Inc. before the new moon turned on the Rising Sun.\" However, the photographs, ranging from one showing Dutch Schultz lying on a hospital gurney examining his fatal wounds to an image of the lifeless body of Abraham (Kid Twist) Reles spread out on a ledge five stories below the hotel window from which he fell (or more likely was pushed), are fascinating and sometimes chilling. And resist the temptation just to flip through \"Loyalty and Betrayal,\" looking only at the pictures -- you would miss the odd, unexplained datum that makes the book fun, like Schultz's final words: \"French Canadian bean soup.

The computer in the New Orleans regional Passport Agency, one of 13 national centers, collapsed on July 9 and 10 when someone turned off the air-conditioning, for one thing, and the work had to be dispersed to other regions. But the main cause of trauma, according to Gary Sheaffer of the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, applications for new and renewed passports have been running 23 percent ahead of last year. In 1993, 2.3 million were processed through June; this year the figure for the same period is put at 2.9 million. The total of 1993 applications, 4.2 million, itself represented a 10 percent increase over 1992.    On a hot day at the end of July, at the New York Passport Agency at 630 Fifth Avenue, which handles only people who have made appointments because of an emergency or because they are holding tickets for the next few days, the line ran half the length of the block from Fifth Avenue to Sixth. William Collins Jr., manager of the New York region, said that the increase at Fifth Avenue was greater than 23 percent, although a comparison with 1993 is not valid because he closed an office at 201 Varick Street in February and transferred the staff uptown, raising the office's capacity from 750 passports a day to 1,250. In the peak week, the week of July 4, he said, the office worked at capacity, turning out 1,250 a day. The figures are still high; on July 22, the total was 767 and on July 25, 882.  A Hard Time    So this is not an easy time to get a passport. January might have been a good time, or February perhaps. But the best-organized people seem to be disheveled this summer; among those who have told me recently that they were scurrying to get passports at the last minute are a relative, a co-worker and even an official in the Consular Affairs Bureau, all of whom neglected to check the expiration dates until the last minute.

So far this year, a half dozen or more leading chefs have opened second or third restaurants in the surrounding countryside, from Marin, Napa and Sonoma Counties in the north to Palo Alto in the south.   This gastronomic greening trend has several causes. For one, San Francisco, which is finally emerging from a long recession exacerbated by the 1989 earthquake, is saturated with restaurants. At the same time, many affluent suburbs suffer from a dearth of fine dining. Add to this the allure of the tourist-rich wine country, and it's no wonder chefs are expanding out of town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940821","headline":"Favorites Fill Trophy Cases","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/21/sports/favorites-fill-trophy-cases.html","abstract":"  Janet Evans won her 42d national title and Tom Dolan his fifth as the seven-day Phillips 66 national swimming championships ended today at the Indiana University Natatorium.

As he travels around the state, Mr. Bush freely concedes that the incumbent Governor is \"an interesting, entertaining person,\" if, well, a tad abrasive sometimes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940822","headline":"Paris Journal; In Hooking Carlos, France Opens a Can of Worms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/world/paris-journal-in-hooking-carlos-france-opens-a-can-of-worms.html","abstract":"  Having long cultivated the myth of his own invincibility, the legendary terrorist known as Carlos at least had the satisfaction of knowing that his name was once again in the headlines last week after he was arrested in the Sudan and extradited to France.

It was labeled \"dream-pop\" and enjoyed an early-1990's vogue in England before its trendiness wore thin. Five years later, the sound is familiar; groups like the Cranberries have cleared it up and made hits. But at Manhattan Center on Thursday night, Lush had budged only slightly.   Songs from Lush's new album, \"Split\" (4 A.D./Reprise), floated and kicked, with the voices of Miki Berenyi and Emma Anderson still blurred by guitar overtones. Yet the new tunes were slightly more down-to-earth than early songs like \"De-Luxe\" and \"Sweetness and Light.\" Lush has moved pop elements -- guitar hooks, vocal melodies, lyrics about love and longing -- a little closer to the foreground, and it has brought more variety to its recent songs. \"Hypocrite\" and \"Blackout\" verged on punk-rock; \"Light From a Distant Star,\" with recorded tinkling bells, was a folky elegy. Atmosphere is still Lush's vocation, but the band is making sure there are tunes in the haze.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940822","headline":"In Rwanda, United Nations Should Forgo War Crimes Tribunal; Burundi Came First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/opinion/l-in-rwanda-united-nations-should-forgo-war-crimes-tribunal-burundi-came-first-032425.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Rwandan politics cannot be understood without reference to Burundi, especially now.

Its two core principles are yang and yin, symbolizing the dualities of light and dark, sky and earth, male and female. Taoist texts teach that both nature and society seek balance, and that interfering with this natural arrangement can bring unhappy consequences.   Chinese society is rediscovering this today. As The Times's Philip Shenon reported last week, the balance between male and female has been skewed. Under Government pressure to limit families to one child each, driven by tradition that favors boys, helped by ultrasound and readily available abortions, Chinese families have been messing with Mother Nature in an effort to make sure their one child is a boy. The result: a stark shortage of women of marriageable age, and a lot of lonely young men.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940822","headline":"Ottawa Journal; The Clock Turns Back To Lincoln Vs.

On Saturday night at Roseland, two heavy-metal bands, Helmet and the Rollins Band, acknowledged their kinship with and debts to jazz, in much the same way that rappers have been self-consciously integrating their own jazz roots into their music.   Helmet opened its set with an agitated version of \"Beautiful Love,\" a Victor Young melody that has become a jazz standard, and ended its show by playing recordings of Thelonious Monk. In between, the Manhattan-based quartet added more subtle jazz influences to its precise heavy-metal grind. Page Hamilton, who studied jazz guitar at the Manhattan School of Music, played clearly mapped modal solos that approached the energy and strength of John Coltrane, an influence Mr. Hamilton often cites. John Stanier, the drummer, drove the music forward like a benevolent coachman, pounding out rhythms that were more expressive than propulsive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940822","headline":"Is That Deion Sanders Poking Around Giants?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/sports/pro-football-is-that-deion-sanders-poking-around-giants.html","abstract":"  Prime Time in New York?
