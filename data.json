The convention started in Washington 10 years ago as a casual meeting of some of the disparate elements that make up the jazz world.

The Italian pianist Simone Pedroni was 24 when he won the contest in 1993, and is the highest-ranking veteran of the Cliburn wars to play in New York in recent months; Frederic Chiu appeared in the spring, Armen Babakhanyan gave a debut concert a few weeks ago that received critical plaudits, and Fabio Bidini, who played here last February, will give a recital at Tully Hall in December.

The presentation was part of the Southern Exposure series sponsored by the arts center and Pan American Musical Research Inc.    It was an evening of gentle dancing to live and recorded music for flutes and percussion. Many steps were variations on graceful hops. Performers in monkey masks became well-mannered, good-natured simians. A man in a bull mask hopped companionably with dancers whose dignified masks made them resemble venerable kings. Another scene inspired by animals involved fleet dancers in deer masks. A corn-planting ritual looked joyous, and couples in a courtship ceremony expressed affection with an endearing shyness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941117","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/17/style/chronicle-852333.html","abstract":"  It was lights, camera, action Tuesday evening at the Washington home of COKIE and STEVE ROBERTS as LINDY BOGGS, microphone strapped around her waist, was trailed by a television production crew and photographers.

Symphony No. 1    The conductor Eliahu Inbal has written that he regards Mahler's symphonic output as \"a single great novel with 11 chapters, consisting of the 10 symphonies and 'Das Lied von der Erde.' \" To the limited extent that the cycle can indeed be seen as a huge novel in sound, the First Symphony is the chapter that brings listeners up to speed on the hero's world. It draws on Mahler's earlier \"Songs of a Wayfarer\" and \"Klagende Lied,\" and its rustic borrowings set the scene in broader ways. Mahler himself was unsure what to make of it, terming it a tone poem at its premiere, in 1889; calling it \"Titan\" and adding descriptive movement titles in 1893; then discarding the titles (and the second movement, \"Blumine\") and presenting the work as a symphony in 1896.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Good and Bad Gingrich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/opinion/good-and-bad-gingrich.html","abstract":"  Watching the first days of Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich is a little like watching the start of a buffalo stampede.

Avoiding dramatic extremes, the Seventh deals in ambiguities and half-tints: its musical materials point simultaneously to Viennese modernism and the Romantic nostalgia popularized by Hollywood composers. (A rising theme in the first movement found echoes in Schoenberg's First Chamber Symphony and later in the music for the original \"Star Trek.\") The Seventh brings out the zany side in conductors: Otto Klemperer took it at a continental-drift tempo; Hermann Scherchen produced a madcap Expressionist freak show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Study of Death Wins National Book Award","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/books/study-of-death-wins-national-book-award.html","abstract":"  The 1994 National Book Award for nonfiction was awarded to \"How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter\" (Alfred A.

The \"Resurrection\" Symphony, No. 2, was the first glorious sign of Mahler's musical excess, the result of a seven-year attempt to evoke the apocalypse in about 90 minutes of sound.

The city is a place of harsh light, dark shadows, strong angles and violent extremes. The New York fashion magazines may dictate pastels or flaming reds to the rest of the nation. In downtown Manhattan, it's all black clothes and pale skin. The skyline itself, the city's most durable, seductive image, achieves full power, Lucifer-like, as darkness descends and a million cold white diamonds begin to glitter.   New York is a noir city. It's no surprise to find that the Film Forum in the South Village has assembled more than 60 films (nearly all of them in black and white) in its series \"NYC Noir,\" which begins today. The city's uncompromising landscape and the endless surge of its anonymous crowds make an ideal setting for pitiless moral dramas in which doomed characters move inexorably toward a violent end. In the classic New York noirs, the city's skyscrapers and streets simultaneously play the role of the gods and the chorus in Greek tragedy. They are the impassive observers, the iron enforcers, of a bleak moral code.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/arts/pursuing-the-sublime-in-mahler-864854.html","abstract":"  Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and \"Das Lied von der Erde\" (\"Song of the Earth\").

Perhaps because of the big museum shows -- Cy Twombly at the Museum of Modern Art, the Italians at the Guggenheim Museum and, especially, Willem de Kooning at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- the generation of the moment is the one that emerged during or directly after World War II.    A show of Barnett Newman's early work at Pace Gallery and the mini-retrospective of Alberto Giacometti at Acquavella are just two examples. This weekend brings five more solo shows to uptown galleries that feature painters from this fertile period. Two of these shed further light on Abstract Expressionism: Mr. de Kooning's achievement is the subject of one effort while another presents the gestural portraits produced by Elaine de Kooning, his wife, in the mid-1950's. But luckily, the remaining shows are devoted to Mark Tobey and Steve Wheeler, two maverick, less routinely visible sensibilities, and to the young Richard Diebenkorn; these serve as important reminders that even in its heyday, Abstract Expressionism was not the only game around.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Applying Death Penalty","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/opinion/l-applying-death-penalty-864595.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   George E.

The Mayor, according to his press secretary, will not attend, in part because he is offended that he was not invited exclusively. A1.

But compared with the electrifying response she received at last year's convention, the reaction was subdued. Mayors have complained throughout the convention about the effects the Governor's state tax cuts are beginning to have on their budgets and property taxes. B7.

Courtly waiters described specials like saddle of venison with red cabbage, bread dumplings and lingonberries, or pheasant consomme with truffle shavings and duck-liver dumplings, \"the lightest imaginable,\" in mouth-watering detail.   Alas, times have changed and Austrian restaurants are scarce. That must be why Lipizzana is filled most nights with people who look around them with a very proprietary air. At one table a woman called Elsie is being loudly serenaded by a group of young people on her 80th birthday; at another, three carefully dressed white-haired women discuss the menu in slow and elegant French. They consider the Viennese goulash served with a fried egg, weisswurst and spatzle. They discuss the merits of grilled salmon with braised cabbage. In the end, however, they all choose the same thing: Wiener schnitzel. It arrives just as a large man with spectacular wattles and a tiny woman dressed in an ornately embroidered Chinese jacket are inching their way to the neighboring table. The pair examine the schnitzels with interest and decide that they, too, will order the veal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/nyregion/c-corrections-863823.html","abstract":"  A list of tips in some editions on Saturday about ways to tell a bona fide police officer, with an article about the New York Police Department's efforts to combat impostors, referred incompletely to the badges worn by officers.
