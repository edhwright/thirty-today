For anyone who has read a program, examined record-liner notes or simply lived near the concert culture of the 20th century, the stories being told this week at Avery Fisher Hall are old and comforting.    The \"Leonore\" Overture No. 3, we will remember, is one of several ways Beethoven attempted to introduce his opera \"Fidelio.\" Operagoers will also know that most of these prefaces are somehow configured into modern performances on stage. It is also no musicological secret that Beethoven's First Piano Concerto is really his second and vice versa. The Fifth Symphony will come as no surprise to people never before in a concert hall. With its famous themes, fate has knocked and V for victory been signaled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940514","headline":"Cartier Foundation's Glass House","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/14/style/IHT-cartier-foundations-glass-house.html","abstract":"An ethereal glass and steel building designed by French architect Jean Nouvel to house the offices of Cartier and the Cartier Foundation was presented to the public this week as the foundation inaugurated its new digs at 261 Boulevard Raspail. .The add","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940514","headline":"Losing Your Wallet: It's Now Less Awful","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/14/your-money/IHT-losing-your-wallet-its-now-less-awful.html","abstract":"AROUND this time of year most of us are looking forward to a well- earned summer vacation.

Yonville is in \"a bastard region whose speech is without accentuation as its scenery is without character.\" There is little to do there, and less to see -- hence Emma's fatal ennui. Further on, the reader learns that there is only one street in the town, and it leads eventually to the cemetery.   A few years ago I made my first visit to the village of Ry, the basis for Yonville, in the Seine-Maritime department, just east of Rouen. Flaubert explains that the town is eight leagues, or about 24 miles, from Rouen, just off the road to Beauvais.

As a New Yorker and a cyclist who rarely cycles in New York, I've never felt that simply wanting to ride was enough of a reason to haul my bike into the elevator, carry it down the front stairs and into the street and then begin the ongoing abrasive discourse with the urban elements that city cycling requires. Elsewhere people ride bikes expressly for recreation, but New York is a place where a meandering, relaxing spin for its own sake is not just ill-advised; it's probably impossible. There are the circular drives around the various parks, of course, but it seems as though the cyclists there travel only in fast-moving packs, which, for the independent practitioner, turns the enterprise of bike riding into a kind of join-them-or-die proposition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"FILM: The Attack of the Big Summer Movies; Coming Soon: Whatever They Sent Us A Trailer Of","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/movies/film-attack-big-summer-movies-coming-soon-whatever-they-sent-us-trailer.html","abstract":"  AUDIENCES WILL NOT BE surprised to encounter a coming attraction for \"Wyatt Earp\" when they go to see \"Maverick,\" which opens on Friday; both are big westerns with popular stars, and both come from Warner Brothers.

Arnie is a little boy in search of what it means to be a \"man\" -- wife, children and so forth...and be pained by not getting it.

The Polish school of graphic art was noteworthy for its reprise and synthesis of Dada and Surrealism into a symbolic language that was at once playful and subversive. Roman Cieslewicz, a master of the Polish school, reinvigorated prewar Surrealism through his wit and humor. His eclectic typography, at various times influenced by Russian Constructivism, the Bauhaus, Art Nouveau and Art Moderne, and absurdist conceptual collages reminiscent of Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp, helped revitalize a moribund visual culture. Perhaps he was too influential, for Poland allowed him to emigrate to Paris in 1963, where he first took a job as a layout designer and illustrator for Elle, and was soon sought after as a freelance designer of book jackets, posters, advertisements and screen prints. Mr. Cieslewicz did not invent the photo-collage, but judging from his late Polish and later French work he was certainly its pre-eminent modern practitioner. Margo Rouard-Snowman's ROMAN CIESLEWICZ (Thames and Hudson, paper, $29.95) is an extensive catalogue of his best-known pieces -- from the sarcastic covers of the magazine Opus International to the haunting collages about human cruelty that illustrate a 1988 edition of Anatole France's novel \"The Gods Are Thirsty.\" The brief texts at the beginning of each chronological section and an interview with the artist by Ms. Rouard-Snowman, who teaches graphic design at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, tersely explain motives and methods, but the book would be valuable if only for the extraordinary record (from 1955 to the present) of Mr. Cieslewicz's impressive output.

In time past, when Lord Vereker's five daughters were in residence, Blatchards was the setting of a great scandal that came to light with a violent death in the Yellow Room. \"Two titles, a Government minister, a kinky tart, the minister's wife\" and sundry others were mixed up in the affair, which involved \"East End criminals, racketeering landlords, a dead body and cricket.\" In time pres ent, a woman and her lover take turns recalling the crime, of which each believes the other guilty.   Like the labyrinthine route one must take to the Yellow Room, the resolution of the mystery is lengthy and winding and delightfully disorienting. Along with the split narrative perspective and the flashbacks, the serpentine plotting that defines the author's elegant style also supports his obsessive theme -- the undying \"ache of irrecoverable time\" that lingers in a place like Blatchards, in a country like England, after a devastating war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Harbor, Harp and Hooded, Seals Are in the Sound","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/nyregion/harbor-harp-and-hooded-seals-are-in-the-sound.html","abstract":"SEALS are coming to Long Island Sound and Connecticut's shore in numbers not seen for centuries.

That will not be easy this summer, not after tonight, when third-period goals by Mark Osborne and Doug Gilmour gave the Toronto Maple Leafs control of a 4-2 Game 7 victory over the Sharks after Wendel Clark's two scores allowed the Leafs to withstand San Jose's early territorial advantage.   The Leafs, who were outshot, 32-21, won the final two games of the Western conference semifinal series. They reached a conference final for the second consecutive year. Toronto will meet the Vancouver Canucks in a series that will begin here Monday night. San Jose, which ousted West champion Detroit in the first round, was prevented from becoming the fourth team to reach the Stanley Cup semifinals after finishing eighth in its conference.

Creativity was the order of this golden age. Never had so many dancegoers owed so much to so many choreographers, and never had Americans been exposed to so many kinds of dance and dancers.   A country that lacked the permanent theatrical dance traditions of Europe and Asia suddenly witnessed the emergence of pioneers who became titans in the field. Three of their many achievements were paramount: They freed creativity of the dictates of state or private patronage, of the commercial pressures and utilitarian functions still found in the other arts. They liberated choreography from the historic synthesis of dance, music and painting. They triumphed over the legacy that made dance suspect in America -- a Puritan heritage born in Cromwell's England, where theaters were shuttered and maypole dancing banned.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Apartheid Homelands: A Messy Inheritance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/world/apartheid-homelands-a-messy-inheritance.html","abstract":"  The new parliament building, smelling of freshly polished wood and brass, is abandoned, unlocked and unguarded.

It's a peculiarity of film making that the beautiful images on the screen, unfolding in what can seem like a divinely ordained sequence, are as often as not the result of turmoil, trouble, anguish and even systemic breakdown.   \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" started out ugly.

Centuries ago, the strategic location of this Indian Ocean outpost, along with fertile soil, teeming seas and forests of ancient black ebony, made it a sought-after prize among imperial European nations. Successive colonization by the Dutch, French and British, combined with periodic influxes of Indians, Africans and Chinese, has left Mauritius with a wondrous variety of cuisines, languages, crafts and cultures, and a populace whose degree of ethnic diversity is probably unique in an island less than two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. The name Mauritius is Dutch; the island was named in 1598 in honor of Prince Mauritius van Nassau of the Netherlands.  More than half of the population of 1.1 million follows some form of Hinduism. \n\nThe country's official language is English, newspapers are printed in French and more than half a dozen Indian languages are also widely used.

According to a new indictment filed for a trial planned for early June, the defendants, Robert W. Crawford Jr. -- identified as The King, a nickname the Government said he used in his dealings as manager -- and Anthony F. Mayo, his assistant at the management company Cross & Brown, used dummy corporations to overbill the building for fuel oil and sheet metal, among other schemes, between 1984 and 1990.

A reluctance by doctors to confront aging and death, poor reimbursement for medical services and a dearth of qualified academic leaders and role models all conspire to make geriatrics an unpopular field at a time of growing necessity. So Dr. Sean Morrison, a specialist in geriatric medicine, is an anomaly. Through a fellowship program that links the Mount Sinai Medical Center with the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan, Dr. Morrison has spent the past year treating elderly patients in the nursing home, in their doctors' offices and in the apartments they are desperately trying to remain in despite the encroaching years and infirmities.

So it is curious, in a way, that it is the British -- specifically, the British Broadcasting Corporation -- who are now first in line to remember and mark the approaching 20th anniversary of Nixon's resignation, with a voluminous five-part documentary series on Watergate. Running for an hour each Sunday night through June 5, the broadcasts on BBC2, the network's second national channel, use snippets from the White House tape recordings, pieces of archival film and fresh interviews with nearly all of the principal players -- but not the former President himself -- to reconstruct what the documentary describes as the \"greatest political scandal in American history.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"My Thanh An Journal; G.I.

Fittipaldi, the two-time and defending Indy winner, and the 1969 winner Mario Andretti were among seven drivers who made qualifying attempts yesterday during an extension of the first of four days of time trials, made necessary because of rain on Saturday. Each of the entries that drew for a position in the first-day qualifying order was guaranteed one shot at the pole when track activity resumed Sunday. Fittipaldi had been favored to beat Unser, his Marlboro Team Penske teammate, for the coveted pole, worth more than $130,000 in cash and prizes. Raul Boesel of Brazil, driving one of the five Dick Simon-owned cars that made successful attempts on the first day, wound up between Unser and Fittipaldi at 227.618. By the end of yesterday's session, 30 of the 33 positions were filled, with additional qualifications scheduled next Saturday and Sunday.

As a nation's rate rises or falls, it can be removed from or added to the list of eligible countries. New York City planners expect more people from eastern Europe and Africa as a result of the new program. The mail-in period for the first \"DV-1\" visas is June 1 to June 30.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"Spy Memoir Lacks Any Real Evidence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/opinion/l-spy-memoir-lacks-any-real-evidence-097438.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Jerrold and Leona Schecter call scientists and historians like myself who have challenged their book, \"Special Tasks,\" \"naive at best and dishonest at worst\" (letter, May 6).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"Review/Dance; Wolflike Flower?

The illness of a performer, however, led to the substitution of another work, \"Gueule de Loup,\" which was commissioned by the 1992 Lyons Dance Biennial.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"Yonkers Mayor Ignites Debate on Rising School Violence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/nyregion/yonkers-mayor-ignites-debate-on-rising-school-violence.html","abstract":"  At 7:45 on an early spring morning, the 1,600 students at Roosevelt High School were startled by the sudden appearance of this city's Mayor, Terence M. Zaleski. It was not a friendly visit.    The Mayor, accompanied by a cadre of police officers armed with portable metal detectors, stormed onto the school grounds in what he said was an attempt to restore order, one day after a student had been stabbed in a school hallway. But like many others there, Liz Smith, the co-president of the senior class at Roosevelt, saw the Mayor's unannounced visit as unnecessary and self-serving.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"Sports of The Times; The Knicks Pay the Price for Harper's Punch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-knicks-pay-the-price-for-harper-s-punch.html","abstract":"  THIS is no World Wrestling Federation morality play, as scripted by wrestling's giant-sized fan, Horace Grant.

The Knicks opened with a 12-0 lead and then seemed to remember their starting point guard had been suspended for two games, and after that the Bulls performed such a one-sided home-court 95-83 romp that you could have thought it was a standard plot.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"Beaten Becker Concedes: Sampras Does Wear Cape","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/sports/tennis-beaten-becker-concedes-sampras-does-wear-cape.html","abstract":"  On Saturday, on the eve of their Italian Open final, Boris Becker said he did not think Pete Sampras was superman.
