As their avid readers can attest, detective stories provide more than puzzles to be solved.

Returning tonight for a fifth season on public television's \"Mystery\" series, \"Poirot,\" set in the 1920's and 30's, takes place in an England where class distinctions were not only accepted but were carefully preserved, as well. Miss Christie is always partial to the upper classes and their stately homes. Their privileges are taken for granted. Outsiders, especially Americans, always tend to be suspect. The author's detective, Hercule Poirot, a Belgian, is accepted in the highest social circles not just because he is so infernally clever but also because he is even more finicky and snobbish than the British aristocrats.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931118","headline":"Stop the Torture : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/18/opinion/IHT-stop-the-torture-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Stop the Horrid Torture of Small Girls\" (Opinion, Nov. 13) by A.M.

Unger recognizes the changing political sentiments in Taiwan regarding the island's international status. His call for Washington and Asian states to begin a diplomatic dialogue in preparation for an independent Taiwan is also laudable.   However, the statement that \"Taiwanese nationalists distinguish themselves from 'mainlanders' \" deserves clarification. The officially sanctioned line between \"Taiwanese\" and \"mainlanders\" has been steadily breaking down as a result of intermarriages and, more important, political liberalization. Being Taiwanese has almost exclusively been associated with the native (nonmainlander) population, but today \"mainlanders\" are increasingly calling themselves \"first- or second-generation Taiwanese,\" acknowledging their adopted home or birthplace.   A fairly young organization called Mainlander Association for Taiwanese Independence promotes not only its stated mission but also the peaceful coexistence of the island's diverse populations. In view of Taiwan's long and often turbulent immigration history, this development is to be welcomed. HENRY H.

Mr. Bolger will represent his country at the APEC conference and presumably Mr. Clinton will shake his hand.

The Masked Dancers of Losari, accompanied by a full gamelan orchestra, were led by Sawitri Sumitra, a 64-year-old performer known as Sawitri, who is celebrated for her interpretation of the Losari style, which developed in relative isolation. In addition to a somewhat different handling of the traditional masked-dance repertory and the different placement of the orchestra onstage, Losari dancing is distinguished by an angular, abrupt attack that gives its performers the look of hinged, stylized Indonesian shadow dance puppets. The dancers portrayed characters, in solos and duets, rather than telling fully developed narratives. Their masks, serene, fierce or grotesque, offered clues to whether they were good or evil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931120","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/nyregion/metro-digest-464793.html","abstract":"   ROLLINS EXPLAINS HIS ASSERTIONS   Sometimes expressing bewilderment and at other times turning morbidly plaintive, Edward J.

The United States and Britain are right to condemn the coup and to consider further tightening the sanctions they imposed in June, when elections were abruptly canceled.

What these pieces all share is a certain urbane, post-Romantic extension of dancing rhythm: Strauss's pastiche of minuets and courantes, Martinu's stamping, folk-tinged sequences and Ravel's apotheosis of the waltz.   Unfortunately, the Philharmonic didn't seem to be in the mood to dance. The Strauss, at the beginning of the program, received an alarmingly drab and desultory performance. Here is a score marked with instructions like \"grazioso,\" \"galante,\" \"animato\" and, over and over, \"schnell\" -- fast. Yet Mr. Dutoit's tempos consistently sagged, and some crucial shifts of pace were brushed aside.
