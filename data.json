Stranger acts of magic have happened, and \"The Swan Princess\" is one of them. Loosely based on the legend that inspired \"Swan Lake,\" and blatantly borrowing the formula of Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" this animated musical turns out to be funny and enchanting on its own. Directed by Richard Rich, who started an animation company after 14 years at Disney, \"The Swan Princess\" makes first-rate copying seem like a good idea.   The film begins shamelessly, with a Disney-looking castle in the background and the words \"Once upon a time there was a king named William.\" This is a movie that luxuriates in its classic fairy-tale style, with a few updated twists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Auction of Spy Booty Is Set","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/us/auction-of-spy-booty-is-set.html","abstract":"  Aldrich Ames, the convicted spy inside the C.I.A., got rich selling American secrets.

It draws on Mahler's earlier \"Songs of a Wayfarer\" and \"Klagende Lied,\" and its rustic borrowings set the scene in broader ways. Mahler himself was unsure what to make of it, terming it a tone poem at its premiere, in 1889; calling it \"Titan\" and adding descriptive movement titles in 1893; then discarding the titles (and the second movement, \"Blumine\") and presenting the work as a symphony in 1896.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Good and Bad Gingrich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/opinion/good-and-bad-gingrich.html","abstract":"  Watching the first days of Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich is a little like watching the start of a buffalo stampede.

(A rising theme in the first movement found echoes in Schoenberg's First Chamber Symphony and later in the music for the original \"Star Trek.\") The Seventh brings out the zany side in conductors: Otto Klemperer took it at a continental-drift tempo; Hermann Scherchen produced a madcap Expressionist freak show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"Study of Death Wins National Book Award","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/books/study-of-death-wins-national-book-award.html","abstract":"  The 1994 National Book Award for nonfiction was awarded to \"How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter\" (Alfred A.

The skyline itself, the city's most durable, seductive image, achieves full power, Lucifer-like, as darkness descends and a million cold white diamonds begin to glitter.   New York is a noir city. It's no surprise to find that the Film Forum in the South Village has assembled more than 60 films (nearly all of them in black and white) in its series \"NYC Noir,\" which begins today. The city's uncompromising landscape and the endless surge of its anonymous crowds make an ideal setting for pitiless moral dramas in which doomed characters move inexorably toward a violent end. In the classic New York noirs, the city's skyscrapers and streets simultaneously play the role of the gods and the chorus in Greek tragedy.

A show of Barnett Newman's early work at Pace Gallery and the mini-retrospective of Alberto Giacometti at Acquavella are just two examples. This weekend brings five more solo shows to uptown galleries that feature painters from this fertile period. Two of these shed further light on Abstract Expressionism: Mr. de Kooning's achievement is the subject of one effort while another presents the gestural portraits produced by Elaine de Kooning, his wife, in the mid-1950's.

Mr. Spring had attacked Mr. Reynolds over his handling of a much-publicized case involving extradition of a Roman Catholic priest accused, and later convicted in Northern Ireland, of child molesting. Together, the two parties, with 99 seats, had controlled the 166-member Parliament with the largest majority, 37 votes, in the 74-year history of the state.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941118","headline":"The Search for Knowledge In the Suffragists' Footsteps","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/18/nyregion/the-search-for-knowledge-in-the-suffragists-footsteps.html","abstract":"  Imagining Eve in the Garden of Eden, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the founding genius of the women's rights movement, offered memorable sarcasm a century ago in observing that, of course, Eve ate that apple, the better to satisfy \"that intense thirst for knowledge that the simple pleasures of picking flowers and talking to Adam could not satisfy.\"   This thirst for knowledge goes forward with some of the same acerbic dedication at the new Women's Rights National Historical Park here in Stanton's picturesque hometown.

Mr. Branca is a godfather of alternative rock. His early-1980's works for massed, retuned guitars, lingering over structures as elemental as a sustained E major chord, revealed new possibilities for guitar ensembles. Members of Sonic Youth performed with Mr. Branca, and the first Sonic Youth recordings, which meshed punk-rock songs with Branca-like tremolo guitars, appeared on Mr. Branca's Neutral Records.

Many are planning to leave the country. Others are threatening to open veins. A few talk of forming survival groups and fleeing to the woods. Most, however, simply sit around weeping.    To these Democrats I say, Pull yourselves together. The recent Republican victory is not the worst blow to civilization since Attila the Hun popularized sacking and pillage. Not at all.    The unterrifying fact is that Republicans are no more inhuman than my Uncle Jack, of whom Aunt Pat used to say, \"Jack's not tough, he just needs a shave.\"    I have known Republicans from my cradle and and have never been bitten, or even sued, by a single one. Republicans are just like human beings, except for their demented conviction that repealing the capital-gains tax can save the world.     My Uncle Irvey was a Republican. He was a Southerner, but when Democrats ran the Catholic Al Smith for President in 1928, Uncle Irvey did not terrify neighborhood Protestants with warnings that a victorious Al Smith would move the Pope into the White House. The local Protestant Democrats did it for him.    Republicans are decent. One lent me the rent money once without asking collateral. A Republican is godmother to one of my children and has never sought to corrupt the child's faith by preaching salvation through repealing the capital-gains tax.     Republicans, in short, are not much different from people, so it is silly for Democrats to be terrified.     Think, Democrats, think. Your party has really been just a rudderless variation on the Republican party since Hubert Humphrey lost to Richard Nixon 25 years ago. After that the decline of the labor unions left it bereft of ideas, and its only Presidents have been those two old-fashioned Rockefeller Republicans: Carter and Clinton.    For evidence of the Democratic vacuum, how about that Rube Goldberg health-care bill the President offered? Republicans used to be called \"me-tooers\" because they couldn't think of much to do except go along with Democratic ideas.     Democrats are the new \"me-tooers,\" which is probably why \"me-tooers\" are now called \"new Democrats.\" President Clinton is a specimen \"new Democrat\"; that is, a Democrat who thought Eisenhower had it just about right.     You can tell \"new Democrats\" by their conviction that \"liberalism\" is their deadliest enemy and their lack of any ideas not likely to be approved by the better class of Republicans.    With Democrats now residing in the abandoned tents of the old Eisenhower Republicanism, why this Democratic panic about Republicans running Congress?     Well, it's the triumph of the Republican mossbacks of course: Gingrich, Helms, the Western right-wingers of the cowboy welfare states, all those Dixiecrats who used to be Democrats until Republicans became the white man's party. It's the same crowd that couldn't abide Nelson Rockefeller and would have chucked Eisenhower if he hadn't had such a way with the voters.    Newt Gingrich is the Republican who makes Democrats think of Walpurgis Night. With everybody talking about Gingrich's \"first hundred days,\" you might think he is the new Franklin Roosevelt risen out of Georgia to rebuild a stricken nation.    The unreality is intensified by Gingrich's announcement that he will not compromise in dealing with that lesser fellow who calls himself President. This is harmless nonsense, except that people who should know better take it seriously.    Gingrich, whose skill at mischief-making is considerable but whose talents for governance have not been tested, is doubtless blustering to cover the natural insecurity of a youngish gent in charge of a crew that hasn't sailed a ship for 40 years.    Democrats should allow the possibility that he is playing bad Captain Bligh just now, largely because he is shocked and maybe a bit scared to find himself in command.     What else explains his \"no-compromise\" declaration? It's institutionally impossible for Congress to lead. House members who desire the slightest accomplishment absolutely must compromise, and not just with Presidents, but also with Senates.    I should like to assure the Democrats that they have nothing to fear but fear-of-Newt itself, but that would mislead them. A party that doesn't stand for much has plenty to fear from one that stands for plenty, even when, as now, it looks like plenty of nothing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941119","headline":"In Performance: POP; Another Style Change, For a Major Pianist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/19/arts/in-performance-pop-another-style-change-for-a-major-pianist.html","abstract":"  Village Vanguard     Geri Allen's career has been marked by abrupt shifts in direction that have sometimes obscured her status as one of the more imposing pianists of her generation.

Now there is proof of what Washington long suspected -- that the outbreak was caused by airborne anthrax released from a military microbiology facility. The report, published by a team of U.S. and Russian scientists in the current Science magazine, traces many of the victims to an area south of the plant. The obvious surmise is that the installation was manufacturing germ-warfare agents, a violation of the 1972 treaty banning biological weapons.     The findings should accelerate U.S. efforts to strengthen the 1972 ban, which was signed without verification procedures. True, small quantities of germ warfare agents can easily be concealed, making the ban difficult to verify, but larger amounts in weapon form are harder to hide. The main impediment to germ warfare remains what it was when the ban was signed -- doubt that germs can be precisely targeted in a militarily useful way.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941119","headline":"McCaughey to Lead A Study of Medicaid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/19/nyregion/mccaughey-to-lead-a-study-of-medicaid.html","abstract":"  Calling New York's $20.4 billion a year Medicaid program for the poor the \"single largest fiscal and social challenge facing state government,\" Governor-elect George E.

The trade association, joined by six other food-industry and supermarket groups, has filed suit to stop the Agriculture Department from testing ground beef for E. coli bacteria that are responsible for as many as 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths a year.   The contamination occurs when a cow's intestinal or fecal matter comes into contact with muscle meat during unsanitary slaughter. Ground beef poses a special hazard because the grinding process spreads the contamination throughout the product.

The films, made in 1944 for the British Government, were considered unsuitable as propaganda and stored (883-4400).","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Ruthless in Seattle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/books/ruthless-in-seattle.html","abstract":"CHARMER\nA Ladies' Man and His Victims.\nBy Jack Olsen.\n367 pp. New York: \nWilliam Morrow & Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Silken Badges Bearing Mysterious Messages","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/arts/arts-artifacts-silken-badges-bearing-mysterious-messages.html","abstract":"  THROUGHOUT HISTORY, visual symbols have been used the world over to designate status. In China, symbols in the form of insignia took on special significance at the beginning of the Ming dynasty. Around the year 1390, the emperor formalized the use of insignia with an imperial edict: court officials were ordered to display their civil or military rank by distinctive badges affixed to their robes. The decree remained in force for more than 500 years.   The wealth of silk-embroidered squares produced were emblazoned with brilliantly colored images of birds and animals, each imbued with political and social meaning. By 1911, at the end of the Ching dynasty, such insignia became obsolete. But Western tourists and scholars began collecting them as souvenirs and historical documents.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"For the Elderly, a Deli Is a Lifeline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-east-side-for-the-elderly-a-deli-is-a-lifeline.html","abstract":"  In Manhattan, getting from one place to another usually involves considering up- or downtown, not up- or downhill.

His gifts were immediately recognized by the likes of Carl Van Vechten and Frank Crowninshield, and he soon found work doing caricatures and illustrations for Vanity Fair and other leading magazines. Gallery shows, book publication and commissions for set designs followed. Rosa Roland was a celebrated dancer and choreographer when Covarrubias met her, but by the time they married in 1930, she had left the stage. A striking beauty photographed by, among others, Edward Weston and Cartier-Bresson, she became an accomplished painter, photographer and cook. In COVARRUBIAS (University of Texas, $29.95), Adriana Williams, an independent scholar, chronicles the lives and times of Miguel and Rosa Covarrubias with a veritable torrent of names, places and events. Most of the notable artists and intellectuals from the 1920's and 30's seem to have crossed their paths, either in New York, on their travels, or in Mexico City, where they moved in the mid-30's. Their wide range of friends included Al Hirschfeld, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera and John Huston. Covarrubias was fascinated by the ethnic roots of culture and eager to experience authentic forms of dance, music and art before they were lost to the leveling effect of modern life. This passion not only enriched his art -- from the Harlem drawings to his murals for San Francisco's 1938 international exposition -- but also led to books on Balinese culture and the archeology of Mexico. Ms. Williams has not worked this rich material into an authoritative biography, but the abundant information she has gathered should serve future biographers well.

The Cosmati, named for Cosma, the oldest and most active of the group, were a medieval cooperative of stonemasons and sculptors that created a dazzling inlaid marble and glass technique. For over 100 years, it captured the markets and made them the most sought-after church decorators in Italy.\n\nThe Cosmati recycled marble fragments from ancient ruins and combined them with cubes of colored glass to produce intricate geometric patterns saturated with the blood red of imperial porphyry, the dusty yellow of antique giallo and the elegant gray-green of serpentino. With these they decorated everything from cloister columns to candleholders. But it was their floors that were the talk of the medieval world, so much so that from the 12th to the 13th centuries, churches in many parts of what we now know as Italy rivaled one another in the splendor of their Cosmatesque floors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/realestate/residential-resales-853496.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

Unafraid of boring his audience with scenes in which little seems to happen, the Polish director of brooding, haunting films like \"The Double Life of Veronique\" (1991) and \"Decalogue\" (1988) deals in emotional nuance and unspoken dialogue in the increasingly marginalized tradition of Robert Bresson and Ingmar Bergman. Mr. Kieslowski continues this tradition in \"Red,\" the widely praised finale to his \"Three Colors\" trilogy, which opens in New York on Wednesday.   Meeting with a group of American journalists during the Cannes Film Festival last May, Mr. Kieslowski, 53, projected the bookish intensity of an Eastern European auteur. He sported a buzz cut (perhaps to hide an incipient baldness), glasses and a leather jacket. Though his English is serviceable, he preferred to speak in Polish, through a translator, in effect adding another protective layer. He is a director who hates talking about the meaning of his films but will happily discuss technical details at length.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Carolyn A.

That is the inevitable question posed by \"Frank Sinatra Duets II,\" the follow-up to last year's \"Duets,\" which became the singer's best-selling album ever when he was 78. The answer is a highly qualified yes. Once again, Mr. Sinatra displays a punchy (but sometimes punch-drunk) aggressiveness as he recapitulates past triumphs joined by guests who vocally stretch themselves to fit a classic pop mode.    The first album was a conceptual and technological landmark in its teaming of Old Blue Eyes with rock and soul singers like Bono and Aretha Franklin in versions of classic performances that retooled the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle, Don Costa and other Sinatra arrangers. The fact that the singer and his partners sounded as if they were sitting side by side, even though they had recorded their parts separately, made the feat all the more astounding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"All Aboard: Big East Is Switching From the Local to the Express","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/sports/college-basketball-preview-all-aboard-big-east-switching-local-express.html","abstract":"  Three new coaches, each of whom loves to run on offense and press on defense.
