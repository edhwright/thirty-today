The debate now pits an ideal, pure flat tax proposed by Steve Forbes  against modified plans proposed by Phil Gramm and Patrick J. Buchanan that retain popular deductions like home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. \n\n     Advocates for a modified flat tax are worried that, under the unadulterated plan, housing values, home ownership and charitable giving would fall. But these dire predictions are unfounded. Under the current graduated rate system, the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving favor people in high tax  brackets. Currently, the Treasury allows someone with a million-dollar mortgage  to deduct the interest and receive a refund exceeding $70,000, while someone with a smaller mortgage gets a refund of a few thousand dollars.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"The 'Horsy Set' Objects to a Stereotype","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/opinion/l-the-horsy-set-objects-to-a-stereotype-091006.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"Don't Depict Islam, the Religion, as a Menace;West's Biggest Threat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/opinion/l-don-t-depict-islam-the-religion-as-a-menace-west-s-biggest-threat-092428.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Stake in Remy Unit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/international-briefs-stake-in-remy-unit.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"BASKETBALL;Williams Gets Blunt About the Nets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/sports/basketball-williams-gets-blunt-about-the-nets.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"2 Fund Groups Said to Be Seeking Buyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/2-fund-groups-said-to-be-seeking-buyers.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"C.F.T.C.

Simpson has spoken under oath about the deaths of Nicole Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman. Though the proceedings will not begin until April, Mr. Simpson began giving his deposition yesterday in the wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the victims' families. \n\n     In the long criminal trial against Mr. Simpson, it sometimes seemed as though the case was about everything but the fundamental question -- whether the defendant murdered two people. But the civil trial against Mr. Simpson promises  to look very different, and not just because the burden of proof is less onerous. For one thing, we'll most certainly hear Mr. Simpson's version of events -- which seemed as if it was the only version of events missing from the  criminal trial.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"THE MEDIA BUSINESS;AT&T Enters TV Business Via Satellite","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/the-media-business-at-t-enters-tv-business-via-satellite.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"Market Place;What to Do About Broker Arbitrations?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/market-place-what-to-do-about-broker-arbitrations.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"In Deal, Chevron Passes Some Operations to NGC","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/in-deal-chevron-passes-some-operations-to-ngc.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;State No Longer the Goat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-state-no-longer-the-goat.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"Executive Changes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/executive-changes-091685.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"COMPANY NEWS;ASARCO WILL TAKE CHARGE AND CEASE SOME OPERATIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/company-news-asarco-will-take-charge-and-cease-some-operations.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960123","headline":"A Michelangelo on 5th Ave.?
