They have a little-known and often medically ignored yet treatable emotional disorder called dysthymia.   Dysthymia (pronounced dis-THIGH-mee-a) is a mild but chronic depression that can spread a veil of sadness over people's lives for years, even decades, sometimes seemingly from the cradle to the grave. Others may see the people with dysthymia as pessimistic, self-critical, underachieving and lacking in motivation, spontaneity or a sense of adventure. Sufferers may see themselves as suffering from a lack of energy, dissatisfaction, an overall negativism and a belief that things will never get better. They are less likely than others to get married and more likely to be divorced and unemployed or underemployed, although some become high achievers despite their depressed mood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950118","headline":"Farrakhan Plot Looks Like Old F.B.I.

That victory was phony, but 29 years later we truly have one in Vietnam, if winning is measured by a Vietnam that is economically, politically and strategically pro-Western. Yet despite that victory, Washington is reluctant to open full diplomatic relations with Hanoi and consolidate its tentative move into America's orbit. It's time. It's time we started relating to Vietnam as a country, not a conflict. It's time that we declare victory and go back to Vietnam to reap it.    President Bush should have been the one to open relations. He knew it was the right thing to do, and he had the credibility with veterans' groups to do it. But he didn't. (Wouldn't be prudent.) President Clinton, despite his problems with Vietnam vets, has inched closer to Hanoi, by lifting economic sanctions last year and agreeing to a low-level liaison office this year.

As a ragtime pianist and espouser of American popular song who writes operas and symphonies, Mr. Bolcom works hard to erase the lines between the elite and the vulgar, the intellectual and the visceral, the select and the popular.   Music, he seems to be telling us, has pulled itself apart from both ends of the cultural spectrum: the classical extremity eager to isolate high-mindedness and rise above the everyday; the pop end cornered by a concern for the bottom line and an obsession with rigid species and subspecies of style. Neither Mr. Bolcom's \"Commedia\" nor his Fifth Symphony, which Leonard Slatkin will conduct tomorrow, Friday and Saturday at Avery Fisher Hall, are new pieces.

The initial U.S. expeditionary force of 20,000 has been scaled back to some 5,600 soldiers, joined by about 2,000 troops from 20 other nations.   Conditions in Haiti are far from ideal and democracy is not yet secure. Many Haitians, particularly Aristide supporters, would like U.S. forces to stay on indefinitely.

Manhattan, which got 16 points apiece from Heshimu Evans and Ted Ellis against the Peacocks, is preparing for Saturday afternoon's clash with Siena (3-10) at Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, where last season, the Jaspers crushed the Saints in a regular-season game before more than 13,000 spectators.   \"Going into the first game of the season, we had no idea how good we were,\" said Fraschilla, whose team has reeled off four straight victories after a disappointing loss to Iona. \"After the Iona game, we took a good look at ourselves in the mirror. We weren't doing the things that people took notice of earlier in the season. We needed to get back to playing great team defense, playing with great intensity and enthusiasm and using our depth to win.\"   Despite getting his team back on a winning track, Fraschilla thinks there is still much room for improvement. \"We're only 70 percent of where we can be six weeks from now, so we just want to keep getting better,\" he said. \"I don't even think our kids realize that it's our best start in 40 years. We just have them focused on asking 'Who's next?' \"  Canisius  The Golden Griffins (9-6), who have defeated Cincinnati, Penn and North Carolina-Charlotte this season, pose the biggest threat to Manhattan in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Three big reasons for Canisius's strong play has been its frontline of Micheal Meeks, a 6-foot-8-inch junior center from Brampton, Ontario; Darrell Barley, a 6-5 junior forward from Rochester, and Craig Wise, a 6-4 forward from Philadelphia.   Meeks, who is leading the M.A.A.C. in scoring with an 18.4 average, is also hauling down 6.6 rebounds per game. Barley is the league's fourth-leading scorer at 16.5 points a game, and Wise is seventh over all, producing 14.9 points a game.   \"Great teams can have a bad day and still win. That won't happen at Canisius because we do not have that type of talent,\" said John Beilein, the Canisius coach. \"But if we do play well, we've shown we can play with anybody.\"   Canisius is preparing this week for Saturday's home game against St. Bonaventure (8-7).  St. Bonaventure   The Bonnies of the Atlantic 10 had lost 45 consecutive league road games until last week's 78-56 blowout of Duquesne. Oddly enough, St. Bonaventure's road hex, which began in February 1989, was ended on Friday the 13th.    \"I didn't know that,\" St. Bonaventure Coach Jim Baron said yesterday. \"We're getting better. It was a great effort on our part and I think our enthusiasm carried over from the Massachusetts game, which we lost in overtime. We set a goal for ourselves at the beginning of the year that we would win some road games in the league, and we got one.\"  Army   The Cadets (9-5), who are coming off an 89-82 upset of Patriot League-leading Holy Cross on Tuesday night, are off to their best start since the 1978-79 season. That season, the Cadets jumped out to an 11-3 start under a coach named Mike Krzyzewski.    \"We're real pleased with the victory over Holy Cross,\" said Army's current head coach, Dino Gaudio. \"We beat a very good team, and we were just fortunate at the end to pull it out.\"   Army, which next plays at Navy on Saturday afternoon, is led by Mark Leuking, the nation's third-leading scorer. Leuking, a 5-10 junior guard from Austin, Ind., who is averaging 26.8 points a game, had a team-high 24 points against Holy Cross.    \"We knew this was an important game as far as the season was concerned,\" said Leuking. \"Coach kept reminding us, kept drilling us how much we needed this game, but we were already prepared to play it.\"  Syracuse  Syracuse (13-1) has won 13 straight games, including Tuesday night's 91-87 victory over St. John's, a contest in which the Orangemen squandered almost all of a 19-point lead. Despite their winning streak and rise in the national polls, the Orangemen, who have lost big leads on several occasions this season, are not happy with their overall performance.   \"It's been shown the past couple of games that we don't have the killer instinct,\" said Lawrence Moten, who scored 21 points against the Red Storm. \"We have to want to stick the dagger in their hearts. We kind of let people back in the ball game. We can't be doing that.\"   The Orangemen, who have wasted big leads against Villanova and Pittsburgh, will be shooting for more consistency Saturday afternoon at Providence (10-3). Penn  After being routed by Massachusetts last week, the Quakers (9-2) returned the favor against La Salle on Tuesday night, hammering the Explorers, 90-71. Although Penn had six players in double-figure scoring, one of them was not the team's leading scorer, Jerome Allen, who finished with just 2 points on free throws and 6 turnovers.   \"Jerome Allen doesn't have to score for us to be effective,\" said Coach Fran Dunphy, whose team plays at St. Joseph's (8-4) on Saturday evening. \"He does so many other things well.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Johnson, 2 Other Jet Starters in Draft Pool","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/sports/pro-football-johnson-2-other-jet-starters-in-draft-pool.html","abstract":"  The Jets have exposed three starters -- including the high-priced running back Johnny Johnson -- to help fill the rosters of the Carolina Cougars and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Cinnella signed a National Association contract as a minor league free agent and would make $125,000 if he played the entire season for the Yankees.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"In Urgent Age of Newt, Byrd Slows the Pace","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/us/in-urgent-age-of-newt-byrd-slows-the-pace.html","abstract":"  Over in the House, Republicans are intent on defying the traditional, ever-so-stately pace of the legislative process and pushing through their \"Contract With America.\" But between the Republicans and their dream of a 100-day revolution stands the Senate.

Critics, both Democrat and Republican, say the plan will leave American taxpayers dangerously exposed if Mexico defaults on its bonds. They want Mexican concessions for American loan guarantees, including sale of the state-owned petroleum monopoly. They would also force adoption of labor reforms that Mexico steadfastly rejected during negotiations over Nafta, the free-trade accord with the U.S. and Canada.   The opponents are wrong. The Clinton plan is ingeniously designed to stabilize the Mexican economy without costing U.S. taxpayers any money. By stabilizing the peso, it would protect U.S. exports and prevent a temporary influx of imports and illegal immigrants. The plan would also stop financial turmoil from spreading elsewhere in Latin America.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Why Replanting Christmas Trees Is Noble Folly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/opinion/l-why-replanting-christmas-trees-is-noble-folly-483395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Like Samuel Leff (letter, Jan. 11) I also am a hiker and a nature lover, but as a horticulturist I must disagree with him about the annual \"massacre\" of Christmas trees.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Critic of the Left Ready to Step Aside","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/arts/critic-of-the-left-ready-to-step-aside.html","abstract":"  Norman Podhoretz, an outspoken champion of the political left who went on to become one of its leading scourges, will step down in May from his 35-year term as editor in chief of Commentary magazine.

Fujimori might have been expected to cringe at the sight of his wife starting a sidewalk hunger strike against the Government. But he took the news in stride on Wednesday. He ordered his health minister to send an ambulance. Then, he sat down for lunch.   That evening, television news programs first showed the President, eating seafood washed down with white wine, seated at a cloth-covered banquet table. Then, viewers saw his wife, Susana Higuchi, being rushed to a hospital after fainting in the summer heat from dehydration and hunger.   \"It's quite dramatic,\" mused Augusto Alvarez Rodrich, a pollster here. \"Six months ago, she was in the Presidential Palace, now she's fainting on a sidewalk. But at the end of the day, I don't think it will cost Fujimori many votes.\"   Mr. Fujimori seems to be weathering an unrelenting six-month assault by his worst political enemy, his wife of 20 years.   Opinion polls routinely show Mr. Fujimori favored by about 45 percent of voters, more than the sum of the 12 other candidates, including his closest rival, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations Secretary General. Today, Peru's major electoral mystery revolves around whether Mr. Fujimori will be re-elected in the first round of voting on April 9 or in a June run-off.   But in a new twist for Peru's traditionally messy electoral politics, the President's wife is doing her best to make sure that his first term is his last.   Using Peru's radio, television, newspapers and magazines to wash the Presidential palace's dirty laundry in public, Ms. Higuchi over the last six months has accused her husband of having a mistress, lying to the public, being heartless to the poor, tolerating official corruption, being a dictator, locking her out of the palace, preventing her from seeing their four teen-age children, sabotaging her political aspirations, and plotting to kidnap her.   \"It appears that the intention was to put me in a cellar -- then goodbye Susana,\" the diminutive, 44-year-old civil engineer and businesswoman told reporters.   Just before Christmas, she filed for divorce, and then told reporters that her husband, a self-described Catholic, was really an agnostic.   Through it all, the 56-year-old Mr. Fujimori, an iron-willed figure who in four years has broken the backs of hyperinflation and of the Shining Path guerrilla movement, has smiled, albeit thinly, knowing that his public approval rating has not budged much since July, hovering around 65 percent.   \"Fujimori's relationship with the people is similar to Ronald Reagan's,\" said Mr. Alvarez Rodrich, who directs Apoyo, the nation's leading polling group. \"He comes under heavy criticism. But in the end people support him. Perez de Cuellar has yet to explain, in simple language: Why bother to change a President who in the eyes of the public is successful?\"   In addition to smashing the Shining Path, Mr. Fujimori has slashed inflation, from 7,000 percent in 1990 to 15 percent last year, sparking an economic boom that has given Peru the fastest-growing economy in North or South America for the last two years.   Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a patrician career diplomat who turned 75 today, seems to lack the common touch on the campaign trail and draws only small crowds. His coalition, Union for Peru, is a lightning rod for a diverse group of opponents to Mr. Fujimori: Socialists, retired army officers, Indians, Protestants and union leaders.   After three months of the campaign, no candidate has seriously dented Mr. Fujimori's support, despite opposition charges that the Peruvian Government is bankrolling Mr. Fujimori's reelection campaign.    Two weeks ago, Peru's Congress, controlled by Fujimori supporters, passed a watered-down election law that bars the President from making campaign speeches while he inaugurates public works projects.   With public works a key source of political patronage, Lima's Mayor, Ricardo Belmont, decided last year to run for president on a ticket called Obras, or Public Works. Sensing a threat, Mr. Fujimori promptly cut $22 million in federal funds from Lima's city budget, forcing the Mayor to cancel 14 major public works projects. Once a popular figure, Mr. Belmont now runs fourth in the polls, winning 3 percent of voter preferences.   Bristling at the complaints, the National Electoral Board vows that the general elections in April will be fair. Responding to an opposition complaint, the board last month invalidated about 14,000 voter identity cards that were illegally issued to army and police officers.   At every turn, Mr. Fujimori and his supporters have sought to stifle Ms. Higuchi's own political aspirations. Last July, Peru's Congress approved what is widely called \"the Susana law,\" barring the spouse or blood relative of a Peruvian President from running for Congress or for the Presidency.   Ignoring the law, Ms. Higuchi formed a political movement, called, ironically, Harmony. In October, she filed a petition to run for President, and, in January, a petition to run for Congress. In both cases, the board rejected the petitions on technical grounds. Protesting the latest rejection, Ms. Higuchi embarked on the hunger strike.   Today, with doctors urging her to abandon the protest, Ms. Higuchi might seem to be running low of ammunition in her war against her husband. But few people expect harmony to settle over the Presidential Palace. A few weeks before the election, book stores are to start selling Ms. Higuchi's tell-all memoirs.

Nonetheless, Marichu is an oddity, a restaurant specializing in the foods of the Basque country, and it's in an unusual location, near the United Nations. For these reasons, Marichu is worth the limbo dance necessary to wiggle under the dollar limit.   Marichu, which opened four months ago on the ground floor of a brownstone on East 46th Street, is a mom-and-pop operation. Mom is Teresa Barrenechea, a Basque who by day is a press officer in the Spanish Mission to the United Nations and by night oversees the kitchen. Pop is Raynold von Samson, Ms. Barrenechea's husband, a former banker who was born in Germany but grew up in the Basque region. He manages the front of the house. The couple also own Marichu in Bronxville, N.Y., which opened in September 1991.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950120","headline":"Alaska Dog Mushing Harms Animal Athletes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/opinion/l-alaska-dog-mushing-harms-animal-athletes-672695.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   It is understandable that Marylou Whitney would like to recapture the happy moments of her Alaska honeymoon in 1958 (Chronicle, Jan. 16).
