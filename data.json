But four years after the project was completed, Federal prosecutors, landowners and several of the very contractors who built the pipeline are questioning whether a rushed job took short cuts with safety, creating a time bomb somewhere along the pipeline. A1. POLICE ARREST 296 AT A COCKFIGHT   Heavily armed police officers and agents of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals crashed into an old movie theater in the Bronx, seized 296 people and scores of caged and bloody roosters and shut down what had been billed as a national championship cockfight. The raid -- the largest in the 129-year history of the A.S.P.C.A. -- followed two months of undercover investigations that tracked preparations for an event that had kicked off the 1995 cockfighting season in New York City and brought hundreds of spectators and fighting cocks from all over New York State, as well as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Puerto Rico. A1. NEW YORK CITY  QUESTIONS ARISE IN A YOUTH'S DEATH   The police said 16-year-old Yong Xin Huang was shot and killed during a struggle with an officer on Friday when the officer's gun accidently discharged. But a friend of Mr. Huang said that the teen-ager did not resist and that the shooting was not accidental. The two starkly different versions emerged as the police and the family struggled to find out what really happened Friday morning in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. One thing both agreed on was that Mr. Huang was carrying a carbon dioxide-powered Grossman Air Pistol, which resembles a real weapon, outside a friend's house. B3. BOY, 7, IS STRUCK AND KILLED IN CAR CRASH   Seven white candles burned at the front stoop of 192 Nagle Avenue in the Inwood section of Manhattan.

A bill to change the way Rutgers University students contribute to the organization, the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, is in position for a vote in the Senate. Its sponsor predicts that the vote there will be as close as the one in the State Assembly, which recently approved the measure. B5. CASTING NETS FOR SURPLUS FUNDS   New Jersey's boarding house rental assistance fund has $20 million in its account but few applicants for the boarding house improvements it supports, so Governor Whitman will divert half the money to her new urban housing program. She has also grabbed $50 million from the state's unemployment insurance fund that had been destined for a health insurance program that still has not been put into place. And the Governor is looking hungrily at the $125 million reserve that the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission draws on to maintain the giant, inactive landfill there. B5. CHEMICAL FIRE ERUPTS IN WAREHOUSE   A chemical fire spewing hazardous fumes in a warehouse in Hackensack, N.J., forced several dozen people from their homes Saturday night and burned for more than 24 hours before firefighters extinguished it, officials said.

The Hungarian director Pal Erdoss depicts his heroine in a precise, straightforward style. Juli is a freelance photographer in her late 20's, scrambling to make some money and sort out her private life. Most of the time she lives with her boyfriend, a student named Csaba, in a rented room. Her much-loved 7-year-old son, Peti, lives in an apartment with Juli's mother. Her professional identity is even more scattered, because no one wants her work. In deft scenes, Mr. Erdoss presents Juli's life as both average and filled with complications.    Wearing jeans and looking totally ordinary, Juli stops tourists on the street in Budapest and tries to sell them photographs, with no success. When she takes somber, realistic pictures of people lined up outside the unemployment office, a newspaper editor tells her he is interested only in glitzy, escapist photos. Mr. Erdoss works in the social background lightly, making Juli a mere observer to one of the strongest scenes: a woman at the unemployment office, desperate for work, gets hysterical at a clerk who remains chillingly impassive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950327","headline":"Showdown Near on Bill to Stop Automatic Financing of Student Lobbying Group","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/nyregion/showdown-near-on-bill-to-stop-automatic-financing-of-student-lobbying-group.html","abstract":"  A two-year campaign by business and construction trade groups to undercut the lobbying activities of a nettlesome student-based advocacy organization is heading for a showdown.

The other is in communicating a message (all hip-hop says something about society, even sex-obsessed songs like \"Baby Got Back\") without being overbearing, underinformed or just plain obnoxious. On Wednesday night during a sold-out performance at Tramps, Digable Planets and Spearhead managed to avoid these problems by playing with competent bands and rapping lyrics that valued form and rhythm as much as content.   Digable Planets were almost too successful in 1993: for the high-brow, their first album, \"Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space),\" was named after a Jorge Luis Borges line. For those after immediate pleasure, the beatnik jazz-style single \"Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)\" had some of the most memorable hooks of the year. But at Tramps, Digable Planets set out to prove that they weren't one-hit wonders. The group's three Brooklyn-based rappers, who perform using the names Doodlebug, Ladybug and Butterfly, performed mostly material from their second album, \"Blowout Comb\" (Pendulum/EMI), which looks to the Black Panthers and black-exploitation films of the past to find calls to revolution for the present. Behind the rappers' laid-back, tag-team poetry of kitsch and resistance, a two-man horn section shaded the music with playing that was more atmospheric than jazzy, and a drummer, guitarist, bassist and keyboardist made sure the insect rappers had a solid foundation to wander over.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950328","headline":"Building New Ballets Out of Restleness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/arts/dance-review-building-new-ballets-out-of-restleness.html","abstract":"  One thing that makes Eliot Feld a valuable choreographer is his restlessness.

Mr. Feld was at his most imaginative in \"Aurora II,\" to recorded music by Steve Reich. The set by Mark Mongold and Mr. Feld is dominated by an inclined plane that, in effect, turns the stage into a hillside. Seventeen dancers in running shoes come into view at the top of this hill, vanish from sight, reappear, slide down the slope, run back up it and slide down again.

Nina Gordon and Louise Post -- its guitarists, singers and songwriters -- formed Veruca Salt in Chicago in 1993 and had a hit single, \"Seether,\" and a major-label contract by the end of 1994. The band arrived in the wake of the Breeders, who use a similar combination of breezy voices and muscular guitars, and its fast ascent drew suspicion from an alternative-rock scene that's both wary and jealous of commercial success. \"I hope we're worth the hype,\" Ms. Post said as the set ended.   By then, her band had blasted away Breeders comparisons by bringing out Veruca Salt's hard-rock foundations. Unlike many alternative rockers, Veruca Salt revels in brute force. In slow stomps like \"Spiderman '79\" and rockers like \"All Hail Me,\" Steve Lack, on bass, and Jim Shapiro, on drums, turned up their instruments and united in a bludgeoning beat, linking Veruca Salt to performers like AC/DC, Joan Jett and Suzi Quatro.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950328","headline":"Housing Voucher Test in Maryland Is Scuttled by a Political Firestorm","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/us/housing-voucher-test-in-maryland-is-scuttled-by-a-political-firestorm.html","abstract":"  The theory was elegant, the outcome anything but.

And when a Chinese player supposedly dribbled between Kurland's legs and scored a basket during a game at the 1948 Olympics, was it fact or fantasy?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950328","headline":"Hunter College Selects Midwestern Dean and Professor as Its New President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/nyregion/hunter-college-selects-midwestern-dean-and-professor-as-its-new-president.html","abstract":"  A Midwestern educator whose interests range from Italian culture to the financing of American political campaigns was selected yesterday as Hunter College's new president.

Whether the boys are tied for punishment or safekeeping is one of the lesser mysteries of this intentionally enigmatic and unintentionally tired Greek film.    Set in a prettily photographed village, the story focuses on the boys as adults. Stelios, the older brother, was an emotionally troubled soldier who drowned 11 years before, possibly a suicide. His body was never found. Yannis, the younger brother, is now a policeman who accidentally gets information that Stelios may be alive, possibly running guns under a false name.
