It is not easy to argue the merits of Federal spending to diminish poverty, hunger and disease abroad when budget cuts mean inadequate funding for those problems at home. But some substantial benefits for the U.S. can be secured by relatively inexpensive foreign aid programs that are carefully selected and managed.    Aid that directly attacks the causes of global insecurity like poverty, disease, overpopulation and environmental degradation can prevent the sort of political instability and humanitarian disasters that ultimately require more costly American involvement. If the budget-cutters are not careful, they may shortchange aid to those who need it most and where it may do the most good.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950202","headline":"Kovalev Returns and He's a Culprit With Campbell","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/sports/hockey-kovalev-returns-and-he-s-a-culprit-with-campbell.html","abstract":"  There can be no debate about one simple statistic: Aleksei Kovalev of the Rangers was on the ice for all four Pittsburgh goals tonight when the undefeated Penguins edged New York by 4-3 at Civic Arena.

Mr. Armey constructs an adamant defense in a righteously indignant letter (Jan. 30). However, in explaining the detailed intricacies of a \"slip,\" he fails to condemn anti-gay sentiments without exception.   On the day the world commemorated the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, an atrocity painfully remembered as the consequence of hatred and intolerance, it is particularly ironic and offensive that Dick Armey would publicly use the slur \"fag.\"   Although these two events have been separated by 50 years, they are inextricably connected by their essential cores: politically and publicly espoused hatred and bigotry.   There is an insidious link between anti-gay slurs and violence against gay men and lesbians.    Since April 1993, there have been eight brutal murders of gay men in Dick Armey's home state of Texas, yet he fails to address the serious implications of hate toward gay people.   Gay men and lesbians face an increased threat to our lives and well-being for fear of hostility and violence everywhere we turn -- from the streets of our neighborhoods to our jobs.   Mr. Armey owes an unqualified apology not only to Mr. Frank but also to all gay men and lesbians, who must now endure the consequence of his deliberate refusal to declare publicly that bigotry and hatred is a path the world cannot afford to take again.

He hasn't grown sappy or lost his sense of humor. From country and soul songwriters, Mr. Lowe has learned restraint; his lyrics don't gush, and he doesn't over-indulge his old taste for wordplay.

George Pataki has crafted a budget that follows his campaign promises, but also threatens to deal punishing blows to New York City.

Mr. Pataki needed to limit spending, of course, to close the deficit and at the same time make good on his promised tax cuts. Given the reality that he has the political strength to redistribute revenues in this way, questions of fairness -- in sharing the pain of budget reductions and the rewards of the tax breaks -- become foremost.   Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, said the $5 billion in spending reductions was \"significantly, purposefully targeted at New York City.\" He foresaw a $100 million loss to schools, a 25- or 30-cent subway fare increase and several hundred million in losses for the Health and Hospitals Corporation.

This is called paying your dues. There are no refunds, and, for most Manhattan bands, few returns on the investment.

She possesses an essentially fine lyric voice: secure, well-projected high notes, lustrous tone quality at lower volumes, a subtle expressive sense. In certain passages, however, she showed an uncomfortably wide vibrato and a hollowness of tone in the middle register.   This is not the most subtle role in the soprano repertory: Nedda is an unfortunate young woman caught in front of an onrushing truckload of verismo disaster. Ms. Dessi nicely sketched the innocent fantasy of \"Stridono lassu,\" but her adulterous duet with Dwayne Croft's Silvio lacked raw passion, and her acting in the play scene failed to get across the character's slow realization of her fate.

But President Clinton's proposals for scattered spending cuts and modest tax breaks are even more preliminary than usual: He is sending them off to a hostile Congress not only ready to match his bet, but eager to raise him.   If the budget is always more a political statement of executive priorities than a reliable guide to legislative reality, this one is at once a dead-letter and an airmail special. The Republicans who control both houses for the first time in 40 years have vowed to use the Democratic President's plan as the basis for even greater spending cuts and tax reductions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950203","headline":"Police Contend P.B.A. Leaders Hindered Stings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/03/nyregion/police-contend-pba-leaders-hindered-stings.html","abstract":"  Senior Police Department officials and prosecutors said yesterday that representatives of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association made aggressive efforts to thwart major corruption inquiries in two New York City precincts by warning officers about undercover operations.

Rockefeller wing, where you'll pass a West African sculpture of two musicians leaning together and smiling as they play. About halfway through the Pippin show itself, you'll find \"Harmonizing\" (1944), a painting of four young black men singing, shoulder to shoulder, on a street corner in the artist's hometown, West Chester, Pa.   The connections between African art and American primitive art (to use a term routinely applied to Pippin's work) are complex, but one thing is certain. Both are relatively recent arrivals to the world of fine-art museums, and their status still feels uneasy. Tribal art contends with exoticism, primitive art with unthinking affection.

New Jersey's second-highest court ruled today that taxpayers can sue their assessors and their municipalities under the Federal Civil Rights Act. And they can collect compensatory and punitive damages, plus their legal fees, if they can prove the assessor acted out of malice or prejudice in setting an unfairly high assessment on their property.    The ruling involves a lawsuit filed by General Motors over the tax assessment on its auto assembly plant in Linden. In 1986, the company saw its assessment rise dramatically in what company officials said was retaliation for past appeals, prompting them to file the suit.    A lower court ruled that, under state law, an assessor enjoys absolute immunity from lawsuits. The lower court further said that it lacked jurisdiction and that the matter should be handled by the state's tax court.    A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court today overturned the lower court's ruling on both counts and sent the case back for more hearings. It also agreed that General Motors could press a claim for violation of its constitutional rights under the Federal 1871 Civil Rights Act if it can prove the Linden tax assessor and other city officials were trying to punish the automotive giant for prior tax appeals.    \"This is a very, very significant decision that provides an additional arrow for taxpayers fighting unfair assessments,\" said John E. Garippa, a lawyer for General Motors. \"In rare instances where an assessing official acts so egregiously outside the bounds of propriety in setting assessments that it appears to be retaliatory, you can now allege a civil rights violation for that act, no matter whether you're an individual or a major corporation.\"    While the appeals panel said that assessors did not enjoy absolute immunity from lawsuits, it nevertheless recognized a qualified immunity that protects assessors from lawsuits for honest mistakes.    The 23-page ruling written by Judge Stephen Skillman recognized that allowing civil rights lawsuits may have a \"chilling effect\" on a tax assessor's performance and may be \"disruptive of a state tax system.\" But the court held that \"these dangers are not a sufficient basis\" to bar legal action based on the Civil Rights Act \"to a party whose constitutional rights have been violated.\" Judges Thomas F. Shebell Jr. and Steven Z. Kleiner joined in the opinion.    \"If we were to hold that a civil rights action is not maintainable in the law division solely because an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights relates to a tax assessment, it would mean that a tax assessor could engage in a practice of racially discriminatory tax assessments without being subject to personal liability under the Civil Rights Act.    \"Since prevention of racial discrimination by state officials was the essential reason for the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, we are unwilling to read a limitation into the scope of its operation which would prevent a state court from granting complete relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, for such a violation of constitutional rights.\"    The appeals court pointed to other state and Federal court opinions that have held that tax officials can be liable for damages if they \"intentionally and unjustifiably\" raise an individual's property tax assessment \"merely because of the individual's race, ethnic background or political affiliation.\"    In 1985, General Motors built an addition to its Linden plant that cost $5 million, Mr. Garippa said. He said the municipal tax assessment on the plant increased by $30 million. \"That's a 600 percent increase and that's what led to the filing of court papers alleging the new assessment was in retaliation for prior tax appeals,\" he said.    Telephone calls requesting an interview with Donald P. Jacobs, the lawyer for Linden, and Mr. Frangella, the tax assessor, were not returned.     Because the ruling was unanimous, there is no automatic right of appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court. But the defendants can petition the state's highest court for certification while the lower trial court conducts its hearing on the tax appeal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950204","headline":"Ewing Keeps Focus Firmly On the Sixers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/04/sports/basketball-ewing-keeps-focus-firmly-on-the-sixers.html","abstract":"  The temptation was to look ahead, but Patrick Ewing understands as well as anyone the perils of compromising the future by ignoring the present.

Mr. Gingrich recognized that inevitability when he abandoned any idea of abolishing the House Ethics Committee. Instead he opted for a holdover group of five Republicans and five Democrats who had served on the committee before he became Speaker. The move was designed to avoid the conflict of interest that would have resulted if Mr. Gingrich had helped appoint a new committee to rule on the ethics complaint filed against him by his opponent in the last election, Ben Jones.   That complaint raises the accusation that tax-deductible contributions to a foundation linked to Mr. Gingrich were improperly used to finance a politically oriented course he taught at a Georgia college. The complaint asserts that his use of his House employees to help with the course violated House rules. It was recently amended to include aspects of Mr. Gingrich's book deal with a publishing house owned by Rupert Murdoch.
