Byrd's wonderful playfulness and his utter confidence in the juggling of complex burdens are qualities still close to the hearts of early-music groups like the New York Consort of Viols, and also of audiences like the one that gathered at St. Ignatius Loyola Church, on Park Avenue at 84th Street, to hear some of his music last Thursday evening. Concert life, musical training and listener expectations have changed so drastically that Byrd will remain a far-off figure for most.   He was a prolific parent of the English Tudor school, and Thursday's concert was an attempt to wrap a very few arms around a large body of music.

Stravinsky's ballet music, known now as a concert piece, is no less an amalgam of musical terrorism and natural cataclysm than it was at its first performances in Paris. Indeed, listening to the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under James Levine play it at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon was to be stunned all over again.   Music has not been the same since \"Le Sacre.\" Its legitimization of violent expression and its violations of regular metric movement opened avenues for younger composers, but Stravinsky's piece created no school of followers: nothing, for instance, that approached Schoenberg's influence on a generation of Serialists or Chopin's on the piano writing that came after him. \"Le Sacre\" stands by itself.

They just couldn't agree on how much more. And since as a two-year player, Gonzalez wasn't eligible for arbitration until after this season, it was the Rangers who had the ultimate leverage. Yesterday they used it. After failing to win agreement on a multiyear contract or even an interim one-year deal, the team unilaterally renewed Gonzalez's contract for one year at what team officials described as \"a very substantial raise,\" presumably closer to the $500,000 the club had offered than the $850,000 Gonzalez had sought. Two other players not eligible for arbitration -- catcher Ivan Rodriguez, the American League Gold Glove winner, and third baseman Dean Palmer -- also rejected multiyear pacts but came to terms on new one-year agreements.   Kansas City Royals   In 10 years in the big leagues he had never had surgery, but yesterday Mike Boddicker underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and was expected to miss two to four weeks. A minor cartilage tear was repaired and cartilage under the knee cap was shaved, the Royals' team physician, Steve Joyce, said. Doctors had not expected to have to shave the cartilage, and Boddicker will be out longer than had been thought. The 35-year-old right-hander, 1-4 with a 4.98 earned run average and three saves in 1992, will be paid $3 million this season, the final year of a three-year contract.   Chicago White Sox   A disgruntled Carlton Fisk reported to camp, still stuck with a minor league contract, albeit one fashioned in an unprecedented way. The 45-year-old catcher, the White Sox's career leader in home runs, signed a contract yesterday that had to be drawn up by management's Player Relations Committee in order to include language that Fisk, a 21-year major leaguer, had insisted upon, including a guarantee barring an assignment to Class AAA Nashville. Fisk will be guaranteed $650,000. If the catcher is cut, he will be paid $800,000. If he should play 50 games, his salary would reach $900,000; 90 games would guarantee $1.1 million.   Montreal Expos   Outfielder Moises Alou, who staged a two-hour protest by holding out at the start of spring training, had his 1993 contract renewed yesterday by the Expos, ending an exhausting round of negotiations. Alou, runner-up in National League rookie of the year voting last season, refused to sign for the club's last offer of $210,000, so he was renewed at what he and his agent predicted would be a smaller figure, possibly $200,000.   An impasse centered on the club's belief that Alou receive a split contract, meaning he would be paid a smaller salary if he were sent to the minors. But the club relented and gave him a one-way deal.   Alou followed through on a threat to boycott the start of spring training Feb. 27, holding out for two hours. He then joined workouts after being coaxed by his father, Expos Manager Felipe Alou.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"U.N.

Booker T. Laury, from Memphis, and Henry Townsend, from St. Louis, have been professionals since the 1930's; they are individualists who have stayed that way. Playing solo, they haven't smoothed out individual rhythmic quirks to fit in with bands. And since they have largely been ignored by recording companies -- Mr. Townsend made \"Mule\" for Nighthawk Records in 1980, which has been rereleased as a CD -- they haven't been pressured to update their music. Both bluesmen sound increasingly wayward, startling and irreplaceable.   The 83-year-old Mr. Townsend sang epic-length blues, many stretching far beyond 10 verses, that presented a landscape of unending desolation and betrayal. He sings in a weary, plaintive tenor, with quavers and slides that make remembered pain sound immediate. His gentle vocal lines, and a silently tapping left foot, hold together music that always seems on the verge of shattering.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"Tennis; Rosset Shows Agassi a 3-Set Early Exit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/sports/tennis-rosset-shows-agassi-a-3-set-early-exit.html","abstract":"  First came the wonder years, then the half-bald Mohawk years, then the image years, and now, according to 22-year-old Andre Agassi, he has finally entered his professional years.

Sometimes Mr. Roberts will reharmonize a melody, using spare triads at first and fat and lush chords the next. Or he'll arpeggiate through a piece, following the harmonies; standard practice, but with his ability to convey clarity, the most obvious movements become profound, their significance underscored. He lets his hands mark out contrasting rhythms that threaten to tear a piece apart, and he freely varies a tune's tempo. Mr. Roberts has dedicated himself to learning not only the jazz tradition but also the lilting music of the 19th century, and he brings an astonishing richness to his playing.   Above all, he is gaining a rare intellectual rigor; everything he plays seems to have been examined for the meaning it imparts. He opened his first set on Tuesday at the Village Vanguard (178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street), where he will play through the rest of the week, with a series of piano solos that ranged from material by Scott Joplin and Jelly Roll Morton through a standard -- \"Embraceable You\" -- and Duke Ellington's \"Mood Indigo.\" Each piece rambled through all sorts of different harmonies and styles, but where most players take the simplist interpretive routes, usually adding anachronistic modern flourishes to older material, Mr. Roberts has pared the harmonies, adding momentary dissonances like flashes or letting hammered notes resonate quietly. He's an eccentric, without any of the primitivism that eccentricity so often implies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930304","headline":"Iran Reported to Arrest 47,000 Drug Addicts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/world/iran-reported-to-arrest-47000-drug-addicts.html","abstract":"  An estimated 60 tons of illegal drugs have been confiscated and 47,000 addicts arrested since last March in Iran's long-running battle against drug use and trafficking, a Teheran daily reported today.

Although it would be foolish to dismiss Abbott's drawing power, most of the 3,500 spectators came to watch the 21-year-old Taylor oppose major league hitters for the first time. Taylor pitched for the Class A affiliate in Fort Lauderdale last year, and the former No. 1 draft choice did not disappoint the locals who returned as he uncorked his still-developing fastball and displayed a cool demeanor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Starks Becomes Show-Stopping Phantom of the Garden","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/sports/basketball-starks-becomes-show-stopping-phantom-of-the-garden.html","abstract":"  A masked man sparked the Knicks to a 28-point lead last night, then a sometimes forgotten man protected it.

Seattle is bound to lose its magnetic pull eventually, and people will once again consider it simply the home of airplanes and rain. Then it will be Portland's moment to dazzle the masses. Cheaper rents and less hype, but proximity to the alternative-rock boomtown, make the City of Roses an ideal cultivating ground for challenging, smart new rock. One of Portland's best offerings so far is Pond. The group, which has released a debut album on Nirvana's former label, Sub/Pop, has a sound all its own, based in melodic mutterings and angry psychedelic zoom. Pond appears Saturday night in the middle of a bill warmed up by Coffee and headlined by Buffalo Tom. The late show is sold out, so get your tickets now for the 7:30 P.M. performance. Tickets are $8, available at See Hear in Manhattan, (212) 505-9781; Pier Platters in Hoboken, (201) 795-9015, or through Ticketmaster. Female Power     Kristin Hersh, She Never Blinks and Cindy Lee Berryhill, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. The power of woman is unleashed in two separate shows on Saturday at this favorite downtown spot. Kristin Hersh, leader of the trailblazing avant-rock group Throwing Muses, sings and plays her harrowing, gorgeous music in a solo performance; She Never Blinks opens. That show begins at 9 P.M. Taking the stage at 11 is Cindy Lee Berryhill, reclaiming her title as the Dorothy Parker of folk with a set of her dry-as-ice, bittersweet compositions. Each show is $10 and tickets are available at the Knitting Factory or through Ticketmaster. Sweet, Sharp and Blue     Son Seals, Tramp's, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. Son Seals plays blues that can be as bitter as the Chicago wind, but when they're sweet they're like creme brulee, dark and sharp on the surface, but with an inside that's rich with sugar. Mr. Seals remains among the best guitarists to carry the torch from such players as Muddy Waters, paying attention to rock without abandoning the basic 12-bar tradition. His music communicates the harsh realities of black urban life in terms that make as much sense today as they did when the blues were young. This show's a real bargain, especially since Lucky Peterson is opening on Friday and the Bennett Brothers share the bill on Saturday. Sets begin at 8:30 and 11:30 each night, and tickets are available at Tramp's or through Ticketmaster.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Trade's New Sheriff","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/trade-s-new-sheriff.html","abstract":"  Both Clintons were on view last week.

(Who could forget \"The Great Age of Japanese Buddhist Sculpture\" in 1982?) But its recent track record has been somewhat spotty.

By contrast, \"Visions of the Dharma: Japanese Buddhist Paintings and Prints in the Honolulu Academy of Arts\" brings the society back up to speed. The work is extremely beautiful and is unfamiliar locally; much of it is being published for the first time in the good-looking catalogue written by the Honolulu Academy's curator of Asian art, Stephen Little, that accompanies the show. The catalogue's contention that the academy has one of the \"finest groupings of Japanese Buddhist paintings and prints in the United States\" may be a bit inflated; with collections in Boston, Cleveland, San Francisco and Washington on the list, the competition is fairly stiff.

Steinbrenner's routine shamelessness was diminished and he merely materialized at spring training rather than stage an elaborate entrance with choppers, limos and celebrity look-alikes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-93948759790.html","abstract":"1918: An Ignoble Peace","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Sounds Around Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/arts/sounds-around-town-628593.html","abstract":"  Trio Plus One    Daryl Scherman Quartet, Tavern on the Green, Central Park West at 67th Street, (212) 873-3200. For several years the pianist and singer Daryl Scherman has been developing an enviable polish as a performer with a repertory of rarely heard songs, chosen perceptively from the pop output of the last 70 years. She has done this in solo situations, in a duo with the bassist Boots Maleson and in a trio with the guitarist James Chirillo. This weekend her group has become a quartet with the addition of the saxophonist Morris Goldberg, a white native of South Africa who came to the United States 30 years ago and has spent much of his career here playing with black South Africans like Hugh Masakela and Abdullah Ibrahim as well as with American musicians. The result is an unusual mixture of sources and styles. The group plays tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30, and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. There is a music charge of $15 tonight and tomorrow, but no minimum at any show. In Great Footsteps     Ruth Brown, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. As great singers like Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington have passed from the music scene, one of the singers following most capably in their tradition is Ruth Brown. She might have been just a rhythm-and-blues belter, which was the way she started out in the 1950's, but she added to this the jazz inspiration she received from Holiday, Vaughan and Washington. In fact, her program at Fat Tuesday's includes many jazz standards, which she will record for an album when her engagement ends. Backed by a group led by the guitarist Rodney Jones, she will sing tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $27.50 music charge and a $10 minimum. Cabaret and Jazz     Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, J's, 2581 Broadway, north of 97th Street, (212) 666-3600. A year ago, when the Manhattan Association of Caberets and Clubs had firmly established March as Cabaret Month, J's brought another flavor to the celebration with friendly programs called \"Cabaret Meets Jazz.\" The two elements are joining forces again on Sundays this year, starting this weekend when a pair of rising cabaret singers, Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, share the evening and the backing of a jazz trio led by the pianist Billy Charlap with Sean Smith on bass and Tim Horner at the drums. Miss Caplan came to attention Off Broadway in \"Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding\" and Mr. Porter was the 1992 \"Star Search\" winner. Miss Caplan goes on at 8:30 P.M. and Mr. Porter at 10; at 11:30 Mr. Charlap's trio has the stage to itself. There is a $12 minimum at the tables and a $7 minimum at the bar.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Philippines:A Long Road, but Ramos Is Under Way","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/IHT-philippinesa-long-road-but-ramos-is-under-way.html","abstract":"- Things are looking up in the Philippines, although there is still a long way to go.

We have been spoiled by the great success of our 12 notes and we tend to take them for granted. On the piano keyboard the artifice is still greater. We have sliced up the octave into 12 equal parts, leaving every note just a little out of tune.    One of the tasks taken on by the pianist Phillip Bush in Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday night was to remind us that the piano's tuning is only a recent development, that other systems of tuning are available to make other expressions possible. He had three Yamaha grands, a Steinway grand and a Yamaha SY77 Synthesizer with a computer on stage with him, each offering a slightly different historical model of what our scale might sound like. The influence of the composer Harry Partch, who had an interest in microtones and tuning, could be heard throughout the newer works.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Candidates for Congress Spent Record $678 Million, a 52% Jump","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/us/candidates-for-congress-spent-record-678-million-a-52-jump.html","abstract":"  Candidates for the House and Senate spent more than two-thirds of a billion dollars on their 1992 election campaigns, 52 percent more than was spent on the 1990 legislative races, the Federal Election Commission said today.

Wojciech Jaruzelski is twice guaranteed a large place in Polish history. In December 1981 he was the tough-minded Communist boss who imposed martial law to crush Solidarity, the grass-roots labor movement. His military and secret police forces hunted down thousands of activists and herded them off to detention camps. He came to symbolize, personally, the reimposition at gunpoint of a hated, Soviet-sponsored dictatorship on a resentful Polish nation.   Yet less than eight years later, in early 1989, it was the same General Jaruzelski who authorized Solidarity's return to legal status, and eventually its accession to government power. Poland soon became the first non-Communist state in Eastern Europe since World War II, and General Jaruzelski felt comfortable enough with the new regime to stay on as President for another year and more.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Foot Infections Puts Jordan in the Hospital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/sports/sports-people-basketball-foot-infections-puts-jordan-in-the-hospital.html","abstract":"  MICHAEL JORDAN was hospitalized yesterday in Chicago because of a foot infection.

This time around city officials appear to be taking a more conciliatory approach. They are reaching out more to the businesses, known as sex clubs, and seeking their cooperation in monitoring themselves rather than forcing further closings.

Emphasis on Monitoring    The resurgence of commercial sex establishments, catering to both homosexuals and heterosexuals, in New York and other cities is at odds with signs that many people are growing more conservative in their sexual practices because they fear AIDS. Public health officials in New York City say several factors may be at play -- denial of the H.I.V. risk, a sense of immortality among younger generations, sexual preferences that are difficult to modify, and even a sense of fatalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"How Do You Fight the Mob?

He crawls to the rear of the car, removes the hose from the exhaust and sneaks back to the bushes. After a few minutes, the man climbs out again, weeping and mumbling and holding a bottle of whisky, reattaches the hose and climbs back into the car. Ricky begins to cry and to plead with his brother to take him home, but Mark pulls the hose loose again. This bizarre ritual continues until the man catches Mark and drags him into the car to die beside him.   Inside, the man threatens Mark with a gun and drunkenly explains why he's committing suicide. He's a lawyer who does work for the mob, and one of his clients, Barry (the Blade) Muldanno, has murdered a United States Senator. Nobody can find the body to use as evidence, but the suicidal lawyer has just learned that Barry hid it under the floor of the lawyer's garage. Besides Barry the Blade, he's the only one who knows, so his life is worthless.   While the lawyer is telling Mark all this and getting steadily drunker, Ricky removes the hose. Mark then escapes from the car and hides in the bushes again. The lawyer climbs out of the car once more, sees the detached hose and shoots himself in the head. The boys run home. Ricky goes into traumatic shock and has to be hospitalized. Both the police and Barry the Blade begin to suspect what the lawyer told Mark just before he died. They begin to press the boy to tell.   But what is most astonishing about this opening, which takes all of 20 pages, is how little Mr. Grisham does with it in the next 400 pages. \"The Client\" brings new force to the word anticlimax. It is as if at the outset the narrator had announced that he was about to conduct us on a journey across a desert with a cactus and a rock in it to a mountain range beyond, and that several surprises were in store. The surprises turn out to be that the cactus is a cactus, the rock is a rock and the mountain range is a mountain range. Once again, as he did in \"The Firm,\" Mr. Grisham enraptures us with a story that has hardly any point.   What's most irritating is how deeply the plot hooks us. Mark Sway is \"a tough little kid, raised on the streets and wise beyond his years,\" as another character gratuitously informs us. Instead of letting himself be pushed around, Mark goes out and hires himself a lawyer, a woman who calls herself Reggie Love, and he tells her what he's feeling: \"I'm really sick of this. Just sick of it. All my buddies are in school today, having a good time, being normal, fighting with girls during recess, playing jokes on the teachers, you know, the usual stuff. And look at me. Running around town with my lawyer, reading about my adventures in the newspapers, looking at my face on the front page, hiding from reporters, dodging killers with switch-blades.

Tethering was, in a sense, the raison d'etre of Mr. Feld's new \"Frets and Women.\" The ballet, set to music by Lou Harrison that tended to be repetitive and self-limiting, is a ritualistic dance for a group of nine women, with solos for three of them. The women are dressed in gray sheaths that cover their body from shoulders to toe, but leave one leg bare.

At a glance, his idiosyncratic blending of Tanzanian folk song, American blues and jazz and European art music may seem trendy or calculated, but one must admit that he comes by it honestly: He was born in London in 1957, and after studying classical music as a child, he joined the music-theater troupe directed by his stepfather, Roy Hart.

This production has managed to grasp not only Janacek's two-tiered conception, but also the complexities of his context.
