Singapore is probably the safest city in the world, although at the expense of many individual rights. \n\nSingapore is the lengthened shadow of Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled as Prime Minister for 31 years. He took the country from poverty to plenty in one generation (its per capita gross national product is higher than that of its erstwhile colonizer, England). Upon leaving office in 1990, he took the title of Senior Minister and remains enormously influential. He has also embarked on a career of sorts as a pundit, speaking his mind with impolitic frankness. In January, I interviewed him.\n\nQ. Do you view the United States as a model for other countries? \n\nA. I find attractive and unattractive features. I like the free, easy and open relations between people regardless of social status, ethnicity or religion. And the things I have always admired about America: the openness in argument about what is good or bad for society; the accountability of public officials, and the lack of secrecy and terror that are part and parcel of Communist government. \n\nBut as a total system, I find parts of it totally unacceptable: guns, drugs, violent crime, vagrancy, unbecoming behavior in public -- in sum, the breakdown of civil society. The expansion of the right of the individual to behave or misbehave as he pleases has come at the expense of orderly society. In the East, the main object is to have a well-ordered society so that everybody can have maximum enjoyment of his freedoms. This freedom can only exist in an ordered state and not in a natural state of contention and anarchy. \n\nLet me give you an example that encapsulates the whole difference between America and Singapore. America has a vicious drug problem. How does it solve it? It goes around the world helping other antinarcotic agencies to try and stop the suppliers. It pays for helicopters, defoliating agents and so on. And when it is provoked, it captures the President of Panama and brings him to trial in Florida. \n\nSingapore does not have that option. We can't go to Burma and capture warlords. What we can do is pass a law which says that any customs officer or policeman who sees anybody in Singapore behaving suspiciously, leading him to suspect the person is under the influence of drugs, can require that person to have his urine tested. If the sample is found to contain drugs, the man immediately goes for treatment. In America, if you did that it would be an invasion of the individual's rights and you would be sued.\n\nI was interested to read that Colin Powell, when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. military followed our approach because when a recruit signs up he agrees to be tested. Now, I would have thought this kind of approach would be quite an effective way to deal with the terrible drug problem you have. But the idea of the inviolability of the individual has been turned into dogma. And yet nobody minds when the Army captures the president of another state and puts him in jail. I find that incomprehensible. This approach will not solve America's drug problem. Whereas with Singapore's way, we may not solve it, but we will lessen it considerably, as we have done.\n\nQ. Would it be fair to say that you admired America more 25 years ago? What, in your view, went wrong?\n\nA. Yes, things have changed. I would hazard a guess that it has a lot to do with the erosion of the moral underpinnings of a society and the diminution of personal responsibility. The liberal, intellectual tradition that developed after World War II claimed that human beings had arrived at this perfect state where everybody would be better off if they were allowed to do their own thing and flourish. It has not worked out, and I doubt that it will. Certain basics about human nature do not change.\n\nMan needs a certain moral sense of right and wrong. There is such a thing called evil, and it is not the result of being a victim of society. You are just an evil man, prone to do evil things, and you have to be stopped from doing them. Westerners have abandoned an ethical basis for society, believing that all problems are solvable by a good government, which we in the East never believed possible.\n\nQ. Is such a fundamental shift in culture irreversible?\n\nA. No, it is a swing of the pendulum. I think it will swing back. I don't know how long it will take, but there's already a backlash in America against failed social policies that have resulted in people urinating in public, in aggressive begging in the streets, in social breakdown.\n\nQ. You say that your real concern is that this system not be foisted on other societies because it will not work there. Is there another viable model for political and economic development? Is there an \"Asian model\"?\n\nA. I don't think there is an Asian model as such. But Asian societies are unlike Western ones. The fundamental difference between Western concepts of society and government and East Asian concepts is that Eastern societies believe that the individual exists in the context of his family. He is not pristine and separate. The family is part of the extended family, and then friends and the wider society. The ruler or the government does not try to provide for a person what the family best provides. \n\nIn the West, especially after World War II, the governments came to be seen as so successful that they could fulfill all the obligations that in less modern societies are fulfilled by the family. This approach encouraged alternative families, single mothers for instance, believing that government could provide the support to make up for the absent father. \n\nThis is a bold, Huxleyan view of life but one from which I as an East Asian shy away. I would be afraid to experiment with it. I'm not sure what the consequences are, and I don't like the consequences that I see in the West. You will find this view widely shared in East Asia. \n\nIt's not that we don't have single mothers here. We are also caught in the same social problems of change when we educate our women and they become independent financially and no longer need to put up with unhappy marriages. But there is grave disquiet when we break away from tested norms, and the tested norm is the family unit. It is the building brick of society.\n\nGovernments will come, governments will go, but this endures. We start with self-reliance. In the West today it is the opposite. The government says give me a popular mandate and I will solve all society's problems.\n\nQ. What would you do instead to address America's problems?\n\nA. What would I do if I were an American? First, you must have order in society. Guns, drugs and violent crime all go together, threatening social order. Then the schools -- when you have violence in schools, you are not going to have education, so you've got to put that right. Then you have to educate rigorously and train a whole generation of skilled, intelligent, knowledgeable people who can be productive. \n\nI would start off with basics, working on the individual, looking at him within the context of his family, his friends, his society. But the Westerner says: \"I'll fix things at the top. One magic formula, one grand plan. I will wave a wand and everything will work out.\" It's an interesting theory but not a proven method.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940411","headline":"Review/Fashion; The Strident and the Serene","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/11/style/review-fashion-the-strident-and-the-serene.html","abstract":"  By the fourth day of the New York fashion shows for fall, with 11 runway shows scheduled, there was probably not a retailer or journalist who had not come up with some fantasy of making the rituals of fashion easier.

Folks would pay three cents to take the ferry to Manhattan.   In more recent decades, she has seen the neighborhood struggle as a decline in population spelled the end of the public and parochial schools, the movie theater, the Y.M.C.A., and the public library.

Another line of attack, represented by the works produced by Cameron Mackintosh and the forthcoming Disney stage version of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" is the \"if you can't lick 'em, join 'em\" approach, in which plays are stocked with technological special effects that emulate the fun-house thrills of a Spielberg spectacle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940412","headline":"At Masters, a Wacky Course of Events","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/sports/golf-at-masters-a-wacky-course-of-events.html","abstract":"  When golfers in the 58th Masters arrived at the fourth tee Friday during the second round, some of them thought they were hallucinating.

The radio spots featured the show's star, Glenn Close, saying, \"And now, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\"   Weeks before that, a three-page advertisement in The New York Times had announced telephone ticket sales for \"Show Boat,\" the Harold Prince revival of the 1927 Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein classic, which is to open on Oct. 2. That ad was accompanied by an eruption of television and radio spots narrated by James Earl Jones. Group-sales and theater-party executives were flown to Toronto, where the musical opened last October, and a 10-minute video and a 12-page glossy color brochure were sent to ticket-buying groups. Last week, \"Show Boat\" answered the \"Sunset\" campaign with a second major burst of advertising, on radio and television.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940412","headline":"Allow Nanny Employers More for Child Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/opinion/l-allow-nanny-employers-more-for-child-care-758450.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Addressing Nannygate\" (editorial, March 30), you suggest that Congress will have gone a long way toward solving the problem of failure to pay Social Security taxes for domestic workers by increasing to $620 the minimum one must pay a domestic employee before having to file Social Security tax forms.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940412","headline":"1919:Geneva Selected : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/opinion/IHT-1919geneva-selected-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS- By twelve votes to six the Commission of the League of Nations has chosen Geneva to be the seat of the League of Nations.

Stationed in Brooklyn, he eventually wound up in a wartime musical called \"Tars and Spars.\" There he met Max Liebman, the producer who would loom large in the rest of his career.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940412","headline":"Review/Fashion; For Calvin Klein, Suburbia Reigns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/style/review-fashion-for-calvin-klein-suburbia-reigns.html","abstract":"  White shoes are not a city thing.

He had already published a slightly noticed novella, but had to face the unwelcome news that his new book, about the aftermath of World War II in a ravaged Cologne, was hardly the sort of thing that could establish a fledgling literary reputation in 1950's Germany. His publisher refused to issue it, saying it wasn't good enough but meaning, it is now clear, that the subject matter was just too depressing and dark for the beaten and war-weary country to cope with.    The rejection almost caused Boll -- who had repeatedly been forced to stop work on \"The Silent Angel\" to churn out short stories to pay the rent and help support his three small sons -- to give up writing altogether. Instead, the author, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1972, ended up incorporating many of the themes and characters from \"The Silent Angel\" into subsequent works. The protagonist, Hans Schnitzler, is seen by Boll scholars as the precursor to Hans Schnier in Boll's 1963 novel \"The Clown.\" But Boll died in 1985 with \"The Silent Angel\" still unpublished.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940413","headline":"The House Tackles Crime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/opinion/the-house-tackles-crime.html","abstract":"  Now it is the House's turn to debate a crime bill that foolishly creates a slew of new Federal crimes and death penalties to display \"toughness\" but also extends a badly needed Federal hand -- and dollar -- to anxious states and localities for crime control programs.

Western countries value the individual above society; in Asia, he said, the good of society is deemed more important than individual liberties. This comfortable bit of sophistry helps governments from China to Indonesia rationalize abuses and marginalize courageous people who campaign for causes like due process and freedom from torture. Western nations, it is asserted, have no right to impose their values on countries that govern themselves successfully according to their own values.   So, the argument goes, when Americans express outrage over a punishment that causes permanent scarring -- in this case, caning -- they are committing an act of cultural arrogance, assuming that American values are intrinsically superior to those of another culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940413","headline":"Firefighter's Status Worse After Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/nyregion/firefighter-s-status-worse-after-surgery.html","abstract":"  Capt.
