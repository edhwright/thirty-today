It need not be the final chapter. But unless Congress intervenes, the Court's action will cause dismissal of thousands of potentially meritorious discrimination lawsuits -- just because the Court mangled the law before being corrected by Congress in the 1991 act.    A series of Supreme Court decisions so muddled the legal rules for job discrimination cases that Congress had to pass the new law to restore the force of longstanding former laws. In one of the worst examples, the Court took an 1866 law safeguarding equal rights \"to make and enforce contracts\" and read the words \"and enforce\" out of the statute.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940428","headline":"Kevorkian Takes Stand in Own Defense","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/us/kevorkian-takes-stand-in-own-defense.html","abstract":"  Taking the stand for more than three hours in his trial for assisting a suicide, Dr. Jack Kevorkian today steadfastly defended helping a 30-year-old man die last summer and said the aim was only to relieve the man's suffering.   \"Any physician who is a real physician would care for nothing, nothing, nothing other than the welfare of his patient,\" Dr. Kevorkian, a 65-year-old retired pathologist, said of his helping Thomas W.

A 26-year-old woman who had passed out from alcohol was sexually attacked by five male acquaintances. The defendants, indicted for first-degree rape in the County Court, were instead allowed to plead guilty to sexual misconduct, a misdemeanor, before a Town Court justice, who imposed $840 fines but no jail time.

My uncle, who was then a stone mason for Wright, led me past endless Oriental Buddhas, Japanese screens and ceramics. The culmination of the tour was our arrival at the office vault, which was stacked with Wright's Japanese prints.

The four-hour production will be broadcast on Sunday and Tuesday, at 9 P.M.    The title character is feisty Lucy Marsden, now 99 and played by Anne Bancroft. Widowed for nearly 50 years, Lucy is looking forward to her 100th birthday and an elaborate celebration planned by the town. Meanwhile, she confides that \"the memories have been swarmin' lately.\" She thinks about 1899, the year she met and married Capt. William Marsden, a Civil War veteran. She, played by Diane Lane (\"Lonesome Dove\"), is 14 and, for no discernible reason, convinced that she isn't pretty. He, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, is 50, and, although basically gentle and genteel, is haunted by the war, particularly the death of his beloved boyhood friend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940429","headline":"At Beginning of Penn Relays, Villanova Finishes First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/sports/track-and-field-at-beginning-of-penn-relays-villanova-finishes-first.html","abstract":"  On a glorious spring afternoon, the 100th edition of the Penn Relays, America's oldest, largest and most prestigious track and field carnival, began today.

This was enough of a theme for Jessye Norman, who gave an aria concert with the Orchestra of St. Luke's at Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday evening.

The setting and the direction struck an often stirring note of Americana. There was the frame house where Richard M. Nixon was born; the men and women of the armed forces, too young to have their own memories of the Presidency they had been ordered to commemorate, going smartly through their routines; the music from the patriotic repertory, and especially the current First Couple and the four living former Presidents and their wives in the front row like a Norman Rockwell sketch for a new Mount Rushmore.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940429","headline":"Apartheid's Heirs Strut a Final Hour on South Africa's Political Stage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/world/south-african-vote-white-right-apartheid-s-heirs-strut-final-hour-south-africa-s.html","abstract":"  Outflanked by democracy, the band of white supremacists known as the Afrikaner Resistance Movement was a sorry, surly sight today as they lugged rifles and shotguns, pistols and bayonets, picnic baskets and baby strollers into the woods outside of town in angry mourning over the death of white minority rule.   \"We are Boer people!

This was, after all, the lyric soprano's first full-scale solo recital since being fired by the Metropolitan Opera for \"unprofessional\" behavior. Moreover, her piano accompanist was the artistic director of that very institution, James Levine. And while there were elaborate displays of mutual affection and admiration onstage -- Mr. Levine applauding Ms. Battle, Ms. Battle passing a rose to Mr. Levine -- at least until the encores, much of the audience reaction seemed muted, as if listeners were no longer quite certain about Ms. Battle's superstar status. The applause that consistently interrupted the groups of songs was polite and noncommittal, although one fan's exuberance was so unqualified his cries seemed an embarrassment.    That changed by the end of the evening, though, and at least as far as vocal quality was concerned, the experience of recent months has done no harm. Ms. Battle's mellifluous sound was still intact and perhaps even more controlled and polished than it has been in recent years. She can make a song seem entirely constructed of vowels, eliding all the disruptions of consonants. The voice can slip effortlessly into the ear, leaving behind a silky afterglow. There were some signs of wear, to be sure: a few slides up to pitch, a handful of wavery intonations, a couple of edgy highs. Ms. Battle also shied away from repertory requiring too much technical display. But she can still produce one of the most sensuous sounds on the current opera circuit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940429","time":"1994-04-29

But this is also a streamlined version.
