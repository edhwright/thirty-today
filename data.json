The number of secret tests was about twice as high as private analysts had suspected and accounted for almost 20 percent of the 1,051 nuclear tests conducted by this country.    The underground tests, which took place from 1963 to 1990 in Nevada, were often small enough to escape detection by seismic instruments. Some resulted in accidental releases of radioactive gases into the atmosphere, usually in amounts too low to be considered harmful.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931208","headline":"Surgeon General Suggests Study of Legalizing Drugs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/08/us/surgeon-general-suggests-study-of-legalizing-drugs.html","abstract":"  The nation's Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, today recommended that the Government study the idea of legalizing drugs, suggesting that doing so might reduce violent crimes.

At any point in one of her works -- and certainly in those she presented on Saturday evening at Merkin Concert Hall -- a listener can find something familiar, drawn from the stew pot of post-1965 avant-garde styles. But the juxtapositions of these elements, and the uses to which they are put, are peculiar to Ms. Monk. A vocal warble in the style of early Yoko Ono is set against a Philip Glass-style chord progression played on a reedy keyboard; a spiky Steve Reich rhythmic figure propels vocal counterpoint and animal noises. The influences may be easily catalogued, but Ms. Monk's signature is always clear.    Ms. Monk opened her concert with glimpses of \"Vessel\" (1971), a sprawling multi-media work originally performed by a cast of 150. In the excerpts she offered at Merkin Hall, Ms. Monk played keyboards and sang, and was joined by two singers, Allison Easter and Dina Emerson. If the selections scarcely suggested the spirit of the full work, they gave a fair overview of the colorful vocal techniques Ms. Monk employs, and her way of using them to enliven and disguise the harmonic modesty of her material.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931208","headline":"Iran Wants to Assassinate Me.

Williamson County, eager to attract high-tech jobs, offered new tax breaks that the company quickly accepted, calling them equal to those the county commissioners turned down last week in protest of that policy.    As he did last week, Commissioner David Hays provided the swing vote at a jammed meeting at the courthouse in Georgetown, the county seat. After arm-twisting by Gov. Ann W. Richards, who had lobbied to keep Apple from going to another state, Mr. Hays joined two other commissioners to approve nearly $1 million in tax incentives to Apple in return for the company's agreeing to build an office complex in this suburban county a few miles north of Austin.

Verbeek scored twice and Geoff Sanderson added his 18th goal in the first period to help Hartford take a 3-0 lead. That proved to be more than enough offense for Burke, who stopped 30 shots in his first start since Oct. 27. The Whalers led, 6-0, after two periods. Hartford is 5-2 in its last seven games after a 4-14-2 start. Burke, plagued by hamstring problems, was playing in only his third game of the season.

Like that earlier pianistic master, Mr. Goode devotes himself to music greater than it can be played, most notably to Schubert and Beethoven; like Schnabel, too, he is first a musician and second a pianist.

At CBGB on Thursday night, Mark Hennessy sang his lyrics in a deep, bleak baritone growl; Grant Fitch on guitar, Charles Bryan on bass and Peter Fitch on drums blasted out belligerent, bulldozing riffs. But while Paw's songs often start out thrashing, they don't stay that way; heavy-metal verses give way to choruses and bridges that ease back into folk-rock and sometimes hint at country-rock. Often, Paw (which comes from Lawrence, Kan.) does what might be called a reverse Nirvana; where Nirvana's songs often start out quietly and break into a roar, Paw's songs move from metal to melody. The music's colliding styles match shifting emotions in the lyrics. On Paw's album, \"Dragline\" (A & M Records), Mr. Hennessy sings about anger and trust, about breaking connections and trying to save them, about the inevitability of death. In \"Jessie,\" the singer is trying to run away from home, but his dog follows him; in \"Lolita,\" a father romances and denounces the daughter he has abused. \"Sleeping Bag\" juxtaposes an attempted suicide and an auto accident; in \"Pansy,\" an old man howls, \"I just want to lay down long enough to die!\" Mr. Hennessy's conviction, and his ability to distill situations into terse, allusive lyrics, make him a rival of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder.

Three-quarters of China's energy needs, from factories to home heating, are now met by burning coal. The result is all too palpable, as I found on a visit to several provinces late this summer.

I hate them with a passion.  FROM LETTER  TO COMMISSIONER KELLY  Dear Sir:   Please be advised that Mr. Colin Ferguson has contacted us, his close friends in the \"black\" professional community, to advise and assist him regarding his numerous requests for the immediate return of all documents, records, photographs, fingerprints, and negatives, related to his racist and false arrest of Feb. 17, 1992. This, of course, constituted the first arrest of Mr. Ferguson's life.   A review of the documents in our possession revealed the racism and corruption within your agency, as you attempt to deny Mr. Ferguson the fundamental guarantees provided for under our system. . . .    The above mentioned arrest was particularly viscous and racist for the following reasons:   1) Mr. Ferguson had been sitting in the same well defined seat on the #1 train for eight (8) or more stops before his racist caucasian accuser and her racist caucasion female friend boarded the train demanding that Mr. Ferguson move over.   2) The accuser was not denied a seat, since she did sit down. She knew that the row of seats on that train does not accommodate its capacity comfortably, especially in the winter when commuters overdress.   3) The two racist caucasian police officers pushed Mr. Ferguson to the platform violently where he sustained shock and bruises.   4) A caucasian man with a pitbull on the subway platform impersonating a police officer had his dog jump on Mr. Ferguson's chest. He was allowed to go free although thirty or more commuters demanded that he be arrested.   5) The twelve (12) caucasian police officers refused to take the names of the fifteen (15) or so witnesses who came forward for Mr. Ferguson.   6) The N.Y.C. Transit Police has consistently engaged in a racist campaign of targeting \"blacks\" using the subway system in an effort to improve arrest statistics within the subway, which is then publicized with the hope that more caucasians will utilize the subway system.   7) Copies of Mr. Ferguson's photographs were given to his accuser and her friend by the police officers so that in the event the matter went to trial, the accusers could circulate the photographs to friends, thereby accumulating false witnesses to lie under oath and perhaps for future frame ups.   It should be noted that we have experienced the unpleasant duty of conferencing this matter with a deeply concerned young man, whose attempt to overcome dismay appears frustrated by a course of action calculated to disrupt his life, lend to the furtherance of slander, and libel and effect a future frame up. . . .   We hope that your office recognizes that Mr. Ferguson's ability to proceed with his normal day to day activities have been tremendously affected. . . .

When Mr. Yeltsin did finally address the electorate on television this evening, it was to issue an impassioned plea to support his draft constitution, which has come under considerable fire for giving the President too much power. Unless the constitution is adopted, he warned, the new Parliament will collapse into new power struggles and Russia could again come to the brink of civil war.

As far as Bette Midler is concerned, absolutely. An extensive concert tour, \"Experience the Divine,\" has reaped rave reviews and lively ticket sales. She won an Emmy Award for singing to Johnny Carson on his next-to-last \"Tonight Show\" appearance. And now she looks like a shoo-in for another Emmy for her powerhouse, all-systems-are-go performance as Mama Rose in CBS's splendid re-creation of the 1959 Broadway musical \"Gypsy.\" The special three-hour broadcast, Sunday at 8 P.M., perfectly defines the concept of event television.   The first Mama Rose was Ethel Merman, using her last appearance in a Broadway show to crown a legendary career with her most memorable performance. In the process, she bequeathed a fearsome hurdle to all subsequent productions. A movie version of \"Gypsy,\" starring Rosalind Russell, never stood a chance. Some stage productions, most notably those starring Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly, held their own admirably. But the special Merman imprint lingered as a kind of theatrical Everest that would never be scaled in quite the same way again.

High points are Natalie Cole's sassy \"Grown-Up Christmas List\" (an original by Mr. Foster and Linda Thompson), Celine Dion's ultra-lush \"Christmas Song,\" and BeBe and CeCe Winans's pop-gospel \"First Noel.\" Low points are Michael Crawford's stiffly overblown \"O Holy Night\" and Tammy Wynette's painful recitation of the words for \"Away in a Manager.\" In the finale, the performers, who also include Peabo Bryson, Roberta Flack, Tom Jones, Johnny Mathis, Vanessa Williams and Wynonna Judd join for a handsomely arranged and sung round-robin of \"White Christmas.\" STEPHEN HOLDEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931210","headline":"On Stage, and Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/10/theater/on-stage-and-off.html","abstract":"  First Thoughts on the Tonys    Of course it's premature, with half a season to go, but hey, handicapping the Tony Awards is a year-round sport.

This album is more completely realized than \"Colleeyhighharmony,\" Boyz II Men's multi-platinum debut on Motown. Guided by the singer, songwriter and producer Brian McKnight, Boyz II Men has found instant ease and grace. Christmas and winter are themes this album takes lightly; it pays more attention to things like loneliness, heartbreak and joy. Mr. McKnight's soft soul approach on this album suits Boyz II Men better than the overblown balladry of \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\" on the group's debut record. The quartet, which has seemed a bit too retro for its own good, appears to have relaxed a bit. Boyz II Men is finally finding phrasings based on emotion and skill, not based on how many notes everyone can sing within five seconds.

For Uncle Tupelo, a trio from Belleville, Ill., who will perform this weekend in Hoboken, N.J., it's a code word for the kind of music that makes you feel better. The band's two lead singers and songwriters, Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy, have an obvious affinity for some of the most soul-stirring moments in country and rock history: \"Anodyne\" (Sire/ Reprise) has the rustic lilt of an old Hank Williams tune, the harmonic grace of the Flying Burrito Brothers, the loose rumble of the Rolling Stones' \"Exile on Main Street.\"   From the pointedly unpolished production, crackling with fiddle, mandolin and pedal steel guitar, to songs like \"Chickamauga\" (named after the Civil War battle site), \"Anodyne\" is intentionally retro, an homage to mythically purer times.

SCANNER INDUSTRY FACES SHAKEOUT   As more patients move into health maintenance organizations and the nation looks hard at reining in the cost of care, investors in magnetic resonance imaging scanners and other profit-making medical ventures are finding that the bloom is wilting. A1.     Reacting to polls that show Americans more fearful of violent crime and to Tuesday's carnage on the Long Island Rail Road, the Clinton Administration tentatively embraced a proposal to require all gun owners to be licensed. A1.   The Clinton Administration said that 159,000 miles of highways, including many roads in the New York City area, would qualify for more than $14 billion in improvements. A24. NEW YORK CITY 20 CHARGED IN THEFTS FROM PARKING METERS   Six years after New York City created a unit to prevent thefts from parking meters, 20 members were charged in the theft of $1 million in quarters. One collector boasted that he had stolen $45,000 in two years, officials said. A1.   SEEKING WAYS TO PREVENT SEXUAL ABUSE   The city's Board of Education established a 50-member commission to find new ways to track, investigate and prevent sexual abuse of children by school staff members. B3.   Mayor-elect Giuliani called on New Yorkers to give more support to the police. B3.   The jury in the World Trade Center bombing trial listened to a message left by an unidentified caller to the \"News Tips\" line of The Daily News on the day after the explosion. B3.   Five city officials were fined $7,500 each for failing to provide adequate shelter for more than 1,000 homeless families in recent months. B3.   After kidnapping a 5-year-old boy from the hands of his grandmother on a street in Queens and demanding a $500,000 ransom, three men took him to a prearranged meeting place last night and were arrested, the police said. B4.   A student protest over conditions at Sarah J. Hale High School in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, resulted in injuries to three police officers and the arrests of four students, the police said. B5.   Two businessmen were indicted on murder and racketeering charges for what Federal authorities said were their activities as \"top leaders\" of a violent crime gang based in Chinatown. B7. REGION L.I.R.R. RAMPAGE: ASKING WHY   Two days after an angry gunman opened fire on a crowded railroad car, investigators were still trying to determine why the suspect, Colin Ferguson, after years of simmering rage, apparently decided to vent his wrath on the 5:33 train to Hicksville, L.I. B8.   In the year he spent at Adelphi University, Mr. Ferguson appeared obsessed with racism, people who knew him recalled. B8.   At Hoboken, N.J., where 25,000 commuters file out of buses and railroad cars every day, riders seemed to believe that a similar rampage might as easily have happened there. B8.   A gunman shot four people inside a grocery store in Yonkers, killing at least one of them, the police said.

In this appealing mixture of big-band swing and pop sentiment, Mr. Connick assumes almost every musical task. He sings, plays the piano and conducts the band in his own arrangements. The 14 songs include four originals, each strikingly different. \"When My Heart Finds Christmas\" is an all-purpose holiday ballad, and \"It Must've Been Ol' Santa Claus\" is an amusing novelty about a cynical grown-up who learns to believe in Santa Claus. \"The Blessed Dawn of Christmas Day\" is a religious carol, and \"I Pray on Christmas\" a doo-wop style ballad. High points include a punchily swinging \"Sleigh Ride\" and a playful \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" in which Mr. Connick sings call-and-response with a children's chorus. There are also some heavy-handed moments; the most glaring is Mr. Connick's turgid, dissonant string arrangement for \"What Child Is This?\" But on the whole, the album maintains a delightful balance between fun and reverence.

The ruling was the third time in a year that the judge has found city officials in contempt of court for leaving families to sleep for days on chairs, floors and tables in city offices. But it was the first time that Justice Helen E.

One look at Professor Higgins's study will tell you that. There, looming over the grand piano, is a gigantic phrenological head, while the good professor's recording equipment appears to have been borrowed from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. If the musical tells a Cinderella story about a Cockney flower girl who goes to the ball and is proclaimed a princess, it is also the account of a cold, calculating experiment in social engineering that threatens to run amok.
