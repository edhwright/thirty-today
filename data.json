Ms. Sam's office would not divulge the name of the hospital or the date of the operation.   Miss Taylor's condition has limited her ability to walk for any distance without pain. It is expected that she will be hospitalized for five to seven days and will require crutches or a walker during her recuperation, which will last about eight weeks.

Balaban of Copiague told a panel of the State Legislature holding the first statewide hearing on environmental factors in breast cancer.  'Two Years Behind'    Ms. Balaban, the director of the New York State Breast Cancer Hot Line, and other cancer-prevention advocates said measures curbing pesticide use in schools and parks and on golf courses and lawns should be enacted promptly as precautions.    They also criticized a two-year reporting lag in a tumor-incidence list compiled by the State Health Department.   \"We need accurate local and statewide registries so that we know where we are,\" said Lorraine Pace of West Islip, who was recently named a breast cancer education specialist at University Hospital Center here.   \"It's interesting that our tumor registering is two years behind each diagnosis and yet our state lottery is only seconds behind the picking of the numbers,\" she said.    The National Cancer Institute announced a five-year, $5 million study of breast cancer on Long Island last fall, the most extensive study of its kind to date. The breast cancer rate on Long Island is among the highest in the country.   In 1992 a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta suggested that high incidence of breast cancer on Long Island might be linked to rich diets, affluent life styles, age and ethnic origin.    Long Island groups criticized the report and petitioned the National Cancer Institute for a more comprehensive study.    Cancer prevention advocates said today that evidence shows that some pesticide ingredients mimic estrogen or spur its production in the body. They said this effect alone was grounds for new restrictions.    Estrogenic chemicals can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells, some experts say.    Michael Surgan, an environmental scientist in the State Attorney General's office, said that Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell supported a law giving counties and municipalities the power to regulate pesticides.    Currently the State Department of Environmental Conservation regulates pesticides that are labeled safe by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.    \"Long Island should be able to regulate,\" Mr. Surgan said. He said a survey showed that golf course operators on Long Island applied an average of seven times more pesticides an acre than farmers did.   Members of environmental and breast-cancer groups said they also wanted a study of pesticides and other contaminants in water supplies. \"We simply don't think the water is safe,\" said Karen Wolk of the One in Nine Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940218","headline":"Review/Film; Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/movies/review-film-coming-of-age-in-snippets-life-as-a-twentysomething.html","abstract":"Aspiring 20-something filmmaker tracks down friends.

In the show's catalogue, you can read learned tributes to Wright's genius. But to approach this show on bended knee would be to miss the nature of that genius. Frank Lloyd Wright was a Mr. Everybody who gave himself the right to radiate. He was a genius of the conventional, a supreme artist of everyday living, a person with desires no different from anyone else's, but one who found a way to turn off all the No voices in his head and give bold, persistent voice to a resoundingly radiant American Yes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940218","headline":"To Most Americans North Wasn't a Hero","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/opinion/l-to-most-americans-north-wasn-t-a-hero-225835.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   There is a perception that Oliver North, now a candidate for the Senate, was viewed as a hero during the televised Iran-contra hearings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940218","headline":"Yegorova Also Speeding Toward Medal Records","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/sports/winter-olympics-yegorova-also-speeding-toward-medal-records.html","abstract":"  While other cross-country skiers are spending their Olympics chasing Lyubov Yegorova, the Russian is spending hers chasing the ghosts of Olympics past.

In \"Helas Pour Moi\" (\"Woe Is Me\"), the actor plays an ordinary man named Simon whose body is briefly inhabited by God, or so it seems when God's gravelly voice comes out of Simon's mouth, speaking \"thine\" and \"thou,\" to the astonishment of his wife.    No road company of \"The Odd Couple\" could have come up with a less likely pair than these two men. The cerebral and often inaccessible Mr. Godard, a master of the French New Wave of the 1960's, has been under a critical and commercial cloud for two decades. Mr. Depardieu is so popular and lucrative a property that a recent story in Variety practically suggested that the French film business might collapse without him. But in \"Helas Pour Moi,\" they inspire each other's best tendencies. Beautifully photographed beside a Swiss lake, the film has a poetry and emotion rarely associated with Mr. Godard. Mr. Depardieu's performance is surprisingly restrained and resonant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940218","headline":"Critic's Notebook; Surveying the Talk-Show Tunescape","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/arts/critic-s-notebook-surveying-the-talk-show-tunescape.html","abstract":"  BLUSTERY winds, slippery sidewalks and iceberg-size snowbanks can be powerful deterrents to seeking out live music.

Each has a nightly musical guest, grabbing five minutes of network glory, plugging a hit or hoping to revive a falling album. But guest musicians come and go: the hippest on David Letterman's \"Late Show\" (with \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" outdoing all competition in the realm of hip-hop) and the most unpredictable on Conan O'Brien's \"Late Night,\" which books groups that are still playing clubs.    Yet when viewed on any regular basis, nightly television's real musical offerings are the house bands.

David Sanchez knows all the major post-be-bop saxophonists, and he'll use all their angles. He's backed by a trio that includes the drummer Leon Parker, jazz's own minimalist, who only plays with a few drums but swings with great force. Shows on Sunday are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.

Nothing new was imposed; no essentials were removed. The New York Philharmonic's crisp playing was never edgy. The work was full of coloration and detail, and none of it was merely decorative. The performance, one of the finest of this war horse that I have heard, was perfectly poised between the broad, startling strokes of Mussorgsky's original piano score and the brilliant, prismatic effects of Ravel's orchestration.   Mr. Gergiyev, the artistic director of the Kirov Theater in St. Petersburg, is one of the few Russian musicians who can inspire the sort of enthusiasm in the West that used to greet Soviet performers in their rare visits during the cold war. At 40, he has become one of the most sought-after young conductors on the musical scene. He has been conducting this week with the Philharmonic (remaining concerts are tonight and Tuesday).

Of the 80 players who exchanged salary figures with their clubs for this year's potential hearings, only two faced pay cuts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940219","headline":"TRIAL IS ORDERED FOR SUICIDE DOCTOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/19/us/trial-is-ordered-for-suicide-doctor.html","abstract":"  A Detroit judge today ordered Dr. Jack Kevorkian to stand trial on the last remaining assisted-suicide charge against him, even though three other judges have declared Michigan's ban on assisted suicide to be unconstitutional.

This week the White House released a state-by-state analysis of the effect of the higher taxes and cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that it says would be needed to balance the budget by the fiscal year 2000. The goal was local news coverage. For example, in New Jersey, the Administration said a balanced budget in six years could mean raising taxes by $952 for each taxpayer and cutting annual social security payments by

A Florida property developer who bought the trademark in late December for $1.32 million plans to license it for a number of travel-related businesses, including possibly a new airline.   The developer is Charles Cobb, a former ambassador to Iceland and a former Under Secretary of Commerce for travel and tourism, who runs Cobb Partners, an investment group in Coral Gables, Fla. He said his goal was to entice companies to pay to use the name, and invest in those companies himself and sit on their board of directors. According to Mr. Cobb, businesses considering using the name include charter carriers to Europe, South America and the Far East, as well as an airline that would offer domestic service.  Mr. Cobb said he is also talking with a tour operator and a travel agency about using the name, as well as with companies in the travel-apparel industry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940220","headline":"Measuring The Success Of Workfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/nyregion/measuring-the-success-of-workfare.html","abstract":"WHEN officials in Washington talk about welfare reform, they talk about workfare.\n\nThe word, a catchall for making welfare recipients do something in exchange for their assistance checks, is central to PResident Clinton's promise to \"end welfare as we know it.\" But it is a word that has as many definitions as there are experimental workfare programs across the United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940220","headline":"Blessed Are The Sledless","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/sports/winter-olympics-blessed-are-the-sledless.html","abstract":"  After managing to get out of Sarajevo to compete in the Winter Olympics, Bosnia's bobsledders were faced with yet another problem: They had no four-man bobsled.

Rarely has a pop song been better used as a musical accent on film, as Nilsson's sweet, soaring vocal conveys the fragile optimism of Joe Buck, the story's self-styled stud. The music buoyantly follows Joe to New York City as he dreams of his bright future as a gigolo. But as the film spirals downward, from high hopes to seedy realities and from Park Avenue to 42d Street, it delivers a stark cross section of Joe's brutalizing new world.   Slapped with an X rating when it opened in 1969, \"Midnight Cowboy\" was controversial in its day. That X was later scaled down to an R after the film won three Academy Awards, including the Oscar for best picture. (\"Midnight Cowboy\" is now being reissued for a 25th-anniversary engagement in New York and Los Angeles.

With his friend the journalist Harry Henderson, Bearden began working on A HISTORY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARTISTS: From 1792 to the Present (Pantheon, $65). The book, completed by Mr. Henderson after Bearden's death in 1988, is the first in-depth reference work on the history and development of art by black Americans. Beginning in 1792 with the portraitist Joshua Johnston and ending with the contemporary landscape painter Richard Mayhew, the authors concentrate on significant painters and sculptors in specific historical periods; they provide a wealth of detail on the lives and achievements of more than 50 artists. Excellent reproductions, both in color and in black and white, of famous, lesser-known and rediscovered works illustrate the diversity of interests and styles in black American art. A few of the artists included here, like Henry Ossawa Tanner, Robert S. Duncanson, William H.

In 1984 our reviewer, Robert Coles, praised the book's \"clear and unpretentious and vigorous prose.\"  THE GEOGRAPHY OF DESIRE By Robert Boswell. Harper Perennial, $12. This 1989 novel by the author of \"Mystery Ride\" concerns the life of Leon Green, a Californian who at 32 already has a complicated and criminal past. He retreats to Central America, where he finds himself re-enacting former mistakes, including simultaneous affairs with two women. \"Among Mr. Boswell's many gifts as a novelist is the essential one for providing the thoroughness of detail that will seduce the reader into engagement and belief,\" Richard P.

Since the fall of the wall, this former working-class district in the north of eastern Berlin has invariably been described as an island of trendiness in the persistently dreary, still Communist-looking East. Until recently, though, visitors from the West tended to be disappointed. Aside from choosing among a small number of restaurants, bars and live-music venues, many of which opened in the chaotic months of 1990, there was not a whole lot to do except walk around and marvel at the relative intactness of the buildings. (Compared with other parts of Berlin, the neighborhood sustained only moderate damage in World War II, and the Communists did not have enough money after the war to do much tearing down and rebuilding.)    In the past six months, however, the pace of change there has speeded up dramatically. Streets that seemed hopelessly deserted a year ago are now full of new businesses. The turn-of-the-century underground railway line that connected Prenzlauer Berg to western Berlin before the building of the wall was finally reconnected last November, making the rest of the city feel much closer. Dozens of new cafes, restaurants and bars -- or places calling themselves cafes but really combining features of all three -- are regularly attracting people from both halves of Berlin. The best of these places are strikingly designed and offer excellent food, yet somehow manage to maintain an intimate, accommodating atmosphere quite different from their more severe counterparts in western Berlin.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940220","headline":"The 49th State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/books/l-the-49th-state-213527.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Orlando Figes's review of \"The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians,\" by W.

Centuries of tradition, however, cannot keep a healthy folk music from changing. The griot's usual accompaniment consisted of little more than harplike instruments like the kora or gourd xylophones. During the 1960's and 70's, rock and rhythm-and-blues joined an invasion of Cuban pop throughout Africa, and the cities of Mali bristled with electric guitars and large amplified bands.   The wildest music has faded now, but a new generation of griots retains elements of the brash sound and sleek drive of Western pop. The neo-traditional sound of Mali is nowhere more potent than in the southern district of Wassoulou, for which the music is named. Its most penetrating, dramatic performer is a 26-year-old woman named Oumou Sangare.

Today, many of the streets and buildings look the same, but the faces have changed with new comers including immigrants from Sicily, Russia, China and Pakistan. \"We have a huge influx of new residents to this community,\" said Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, a Brooklyn Democrat. \"It's important that they know some of the history of Bensonhurst, so that they can link themselves up with it.\" So Mr. Barbaro founded the Bensonhurst Historical Society last month, along with the Bensonhurst West End Community Council. The organization, will be based at the Bensonhurst School, or Public School 128, at 84th Street and 20th Avenue, in the heart of Bensonhurst. \"We've been kicking this idea around for years,\" said Carmine Santa Maria, executive director of the Community Council and a member of School Board 21. \"I'm pleased that we were finally able to do something about it because our history is rich. This community has produced many great athletes, entertainers, doctors and business owners.\" Sandy Koufax, the baseball pitcher, Larry King, the talk-show host, and Robert Merrill, the singer, are three prominent examples of residents who went on to fame. LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 1643: Anthony Jansen van Salee, the first European settler, arrives from Holland in what is now known as Bensonhurst. 1652: Cornelius van Wekhoven, a functionary for the Dutch West India Company from Utrecht, Holland, acquired the land from a tribe of Indians. For the property, he traded six shirts, two pairs of shoes, six pairs of socks, six hatchets, six knives, two scissors and six combs. 1657: The property was divided into 21 50-acre plots and granted to 19 settlers. Two of the plots were reserved for the poor. The settlers named it New Utrecht. 1783: Rebellious Americans erected a liberty pole with a flag at what is now 83d Street and 18th Avenue. The Fifth replica of the pole still stands in that spot, a patch of green in front of the New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church. 1828: The New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church was built at 83d Street and 18th Avenue. 1887: A one-mile-square area of New Utrecht made up of nine farms, four of which were owned by members of the Benson family, was named Bensonhurst. 1915: Jewish and Italian families from the lower East Side of Manhattan began building two-family homes and semi-attached brick and stucco houses. 1939: Lafayette High School was built at 2630 Benson Avenue. It was later attended by Sandy Koufax, who became a pitcher for the Brooklyn and L.A. Dodgers, and Fred Wilpon, president of the New York Mets. 1964: 1964--The Varrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, establishing a pathway to a more rural area for many Brooklynites. 1975: \"Welcome Back Kotter,\" first aired on ABC. Gabe Kaplan played a remedial student who returned to teach at his alma mater, New Utrecht High School in Bensonhurst. 1979: When the Soviet Union began easing Jewish emigration, many of the newcomers settled in this community. 1989: Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old black youth from East New York, was shot twice in the chest as he was surrounded by a gang of 30 white youths. 1994: Assemblyman Frank J.

Minor repairs can be easy. But take antiques or fine furniture to a professional restorer.   To repair veneer cracks, try filling them with waxy touch-up sticks that resemble large crayons. They are easier to use than shellac sticks, which have to be melted and applied quickly. Choose a touch-up stick having a slightly lighter color than the area to be repaired. Rub the stick several times along the crack to fill it, and then polish the area vigorously with clean cheesecloth wrapped around a fingertip.

We want to break open those false concepts, to get rid of the cliches about Bruckner.\" To do so, Mr. Jackson, and Paul Hawkshaw, associate dean of the Yale School of Music, have organized the first International Conference on Bruckner to be held in the United States, dubbing the two concerts and an international symposium at Connecticut College called \"Bruckner for people who think they don't like Bruckner.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940220","headline":"Open Water Lures Eagles to Shepaug and Points South","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/nyregion/open-water-lures-eagles-to-shepaug-and-points-south.html","abstract":"THERE was a bit of commotion recently near the end of visiting hours at the Shepaug Eagle Observation Area in Southbury.

Although Americans still win Nobel Prizes and publish thousands of papers, some scientists are deeply disturbed by this trend. They say the lack of jobs, and declining national support of science when the puzzles yet to be solved are more and more difficult, have begun to sap the vigor of American research.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940220","headline":"BENEFITS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/style/benefits-211869.html","abstract":"  A Casino Night for AIDS  TODAY -- More than 70 actors who appear in daytime soap operas will gather at the New York Hilton for a casino night to benefit Broadway Cares-Equity Fights AIDS.

According to legend, it was to this land south of Egypt that a son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba carried the Ark of the Covenant from Jerusalem. It is here that the oldest branch of African Christianity still flourishes, its hymns resounding in churches carved from living rock in the holy city of Lalibala. And for many people of African heritage across the world, it is here that the biblical Zion is located, making Ethiopia the land where God dwells.   It is also a land repeatedly visited by natural catastrophe and political turbulence, as the numbing photographs of famished families and the constant reports of near civil war over the last two decades painfully confirm. A hint of the country's volatile political temperament surfaced in America last fall when the ground-breaking exhibition titled \"African Zion: The Sacred Art of Ethiopia,\" began its American tour at
