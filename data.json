Their impatience is especially ill timed: international inspectors arrived yesterday at the site of the North's nuclear reactor, which has been shut down for refueling. A move to sanctions is almost sure to get them sent home.    Washington's top priority is to prevent North Korea from diverting spent nuclear fuel to bombs while refueling. The inspectors' presence over the coming months is the best guarantee that that will not happen. Only if North Korea impedes the inspectors from witnessing the refueling would immediate sanctions be warranted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940519","headline":"Let's Stop Making Myths and Scapegoats of Those on Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/19/opinion/l-let-s-stop-making-myths-and-scapegoats-of-those-on-welfare-139734.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   By your choice of a young African-American boy with 10 siblings to illustrate your May 8 Week in Review lead article on welfare reform, you play into the hands of the mythmakers who would have the American public believe that families on welfare are different from themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940519","headline":"AC Milan Wins Champions' Cup, 4-0","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/19/sports/IHT-ac-milan-wins-champions-cup-40.html","abstract":"To read the mind of Bernard Tapie this morning: What the ...?.Everything known by the Marseille owner to be true one year ago has now thoroughly and finally been abolished, for AC Milan on Wednesday night beat FC Barcelona, 4-0, in the European Champio","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940519","headline":"Florida State Kicker Suspended","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/19/sports/sports-people-football-florida-state-kicker-suspended.html","abstract":"  Kicker SCOTT BENTLEY was one of two Florida State football players suspended by Coach BOBBY BOWDEN yesterday.

Pippen, with two of the longest arms in pro basketball, leaped out at Davis, tried to alter the shot. He did that, too, but he got a piece of Davis's hand, no question, on the way down and an official named Hue Hollins didn't let him get away with it.

Edward Joseph Collins was, for example, somewhat of a Midwestern darling during the first half of this century. Program notes for the orchestra's concert on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall tell us that between 1924 and 1941 the Chicago Symphony played three of Collins's piano concertos and two other orchestra pieces. The listener is indebted for the information, for Collins's name is absent from the most prominent reference books now in circulation.   One of these Chicago performances was of the \"Tragic Overture,\" a well-made bit of melodrama offered by the American Composers Orchestra under Dennis Russell Davies on Sunday. This tidy piece fights off every modernistic impulse while clutching Liszt and Wagner firmly to its breast. Yet the \"Tragic Overture\" celebrates more modern calamity than Romantic tragedy. Its dire mood wells up from the bottom of the orchestra: tubas, trombones, double basses. There are moaning half steps, nasty little snare drum figures and, at the end, a funeral march set against solemn drums.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940519","headline":"With Israel Gone, Jericho Takes First Slow Steps to Self-Rule","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/19/world/with-israel-gone-jericho-takes-first-slow-steps-to-self-rule.html","abstract":"  The Jericho post office was open today, but since it lacked Palestinian stamps, no one could send any letters.

The chorus of townspeople coo encouragement to the lusty infant. None is more enthusiastic than the lead tenor, Mayor Fiorello, who beguiles all listeners by reading the Sunday funnies over the air. In a celebrated aria, Fiorello chants: \"This is what distinguishes us from Cleveland, Boise and Peoria. Nothing against those fine cities, but they don't have their own radio Station. We do.\"\n\nThe Bottom Liners, a group of countertenors, threaten that Station with a tight fist. For this is the Depression, and money is scarce. But a legion of friends rises to defend WNYC and its enlightened programs.\n\nAct One ends with the Bottom Liners on the run but vowing to return.\nAct Two\n\nDecades have passed, and the Station is deep in radio's Dark Age. Many competitors have appeared, chief among them Television and its spoiled little brother, Rock. Together they seduce The Young, an impressionable group whose Watchmans and Boom Boxes become a part of their anatomies.\n\nBy now, the Station's enemies have grown in number, but one of its adherents performs the moving solo, \"Out of some 75 Stations in the metropolitan area, only three play hour upon hour of classical music.\" \n\nThe Young respond an accusation: \"Those hours are filled with elitist trash by dead white males.\" But they are drowned out by a choir of True Believers, convinced that the City will never sell them out.\nAct Three\n\nThe present. Radio has returned to favor. Alas, it is only talk show radio, featuring bombinating conservative hosts and their callers-in. They whine incessantly about the Third World, the declining moral climate and Those People in the White House.\n\nNow there are but two classical music Stations in New York. For WNYC's cousin, WNCN, has undergone a lobotomy and now can only babble the top 40.\n\nOnce again, the City is broke. So broke that although the new Mayor, Rudolfo, decries the lack of amenities, he plans to peddle the licenses of WNYC-AM and FM to the highest bidder. To mollify fans of Franz Schubert and Daniel Schorr, he proposes to transfer the FM programs to a new station of lesser wattage. This is the aural equivalent of replacing a basso profundo and a microphone with a boy soprano and a megaphone.\n\nThe City trades in WNYC for a five-course dinner. Pottage is the entree. The Bottom Liners have the last word. But few can hear it over the Rock and the Right, and those that do can't find New York on the map. It has become indistinguishable from Cleveland, Boise and Peoria.\nCurtain","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940520","headline":"The Governor's Budget Gambit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/20/nyregion/the-governor-s-budget-gambit.html","abstract":"  There is no known handbook to political survival in the Statehouse, but if there were, rule No. 1 might well be this: in every crisis lies an opportunity to embarrass one's foes.

Dick Hyman's virtuosity as a keyboard player knows practically no bounds -- pop, classical, jazz -- and his skills as a musical chameleon enable him to conjure the styles of a variety of jazz piano stars. The trio he is leading at Tavern on the Green is made up of musicians representing seven decades of jazz: the pianist Bob Haggart, a mainstay of the Bob Crosby Band of the 1930's; the guitarist Howard Arlen, one of the bright young contemporaries, and Mr. Hyman himself, who first appeared in the late 1940's in a band led by Guy Lombardo's brother Victor. Their presence enables him to venture into the tradition of such celebrated piano-bass-guitar trios as those led by Nat (King) Cole and Art Tatum. They take the stage tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. There is a music charge of $17.50 tonight and tomorrow, $12.50 on Sunday. JOHN S.

Her repertory ranges from Screamin' Jay Hawkins's \"I Put a Spell on You\" to Bob Dylan's \"Forever Young\"; from Harold Arlen's \"Let's Fall in Love\" to Abbey Lincoln's \"I Got Thunder,\" and her own unique \"Fifteen Ugly Minutes.\" At the annual awards ceremony of the Manhattan Association of Cabarets and Clubs in March she was named Outstanding Female Vocalist of the Year.

At Fat Tuesday's she is accompanied by Bob Kaye, who has been her pianist for almost 15 years, the bassist Chip Jackson and the drummer Vinnie Johnson.

Most of Malawi's eight million people were not even alive when the former British colony, which was then called Nyasaland, attained independence in 1964. A physician given to vehement oratory, Dr. Banda led Malawi's liberation struggle and served as its first Prime Minister. In what became a pattern in post-colonial Africa, he then promoted himself to President, instituted one-party rule and in 1971 enthroned himself President-for-life.

He doesn't abandon the dance forms and gracious manners of French Baroque opera. The singing doesn't explode in Lucia-like extravagance. The remarkable expressions are contained, restrained; the sense comes through subtle shifts in texture, and through the clearly articulated French text, which is almost always set with one note for each syllable.   But by now, William Christie and his early-music group, Les Arts Florissants, have shown how large a universe of emotion lies compressed in this musical style, how a supple sense of pulse governs these declamations, how violence, jealousy and tenderness can be revealed in the ways in which lines are sung and text pronounced. And that is exactly what was accomplished in the much-awaited production of \"Medee\" that Mr. Christie conducted at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Thursday night; an antique language was turned into a living tongue, its every nuance brought to life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940521","headline":"Democrats Fear That South Will Desert Them for G.O.P in House Races","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/21/us/democrats-fear-that-south-will-desert-them-for-gop-in-house-races.html","abstract":"  The South is not about to secede again, but it is getting closer and closer to deserting the Democratic Party.

Mr. Guy brought two things to the show: a sense of play, or wit, and a sound that, as a product of blues culture, is almost lost. The play came out in his abrupt transitions, in which he played in one register, then suddenly jumped into the next, as if the needle on a record had skipped. And it came in his tricks, rubbing the strings with his sleeve or bending notes a handful of different ways or pulling the strings and letting them snap, all creating a vocabulary of industrial sounds: whooshing and grinding and pounding.
