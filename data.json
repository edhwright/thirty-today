Oh, and those celebrated gold medalists who pioneered the National Basketball Association's penetration to the interior of international competition two summers ago? They may as well accept their places in ancient history with George Mikan and the peach basket that Shaquille O'Neal would dearly love to break into a thousand fragments.   \"As for the Dream Team, I think we'd beat them easily,\" O'Neal crowed today on the eve of the 1994 world basketball championships, after he and some of his teammates tried to tear down a few rims as practice wound down. \"Our legs are a lot younger.\"   By today's flaccid standards, young legs and as-yet undistinguished careers nonetheless actuate huge bank accounts and enormous egos. Coach Don Nelson will send Dream Team II, as the marketing propagandists insist on calling it, into battle Thursday night against Spain in the 16-team, 10-day tournament. The United States pros are the overwhelming favorites to take the gold. Croatia, Brazil, Germany Are Here    Croatia, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist in Barcelona, Spain, is back, with Toni Kukoc, Dino Radja and Stoyko Vrankovic, but, sadly, without the late Drazen Petrovic. Brazil is here, though a movement toward youth forced the eccentric gunner, Oscar Schmidt, off the national team. Germany has Detlef Schrempf and Angola has Herlander Coimbra, whom some may recall as the recipient of Charles Barkley's ceremonial first elbow of the Barcelona Games.   What no country really has, unless Nelson forgets he's not coaching the Warriors and fields an entire lineup of players under 6 feet 4 inches, is a chance to run with the United States for more than a few fanciful moments. And, regardless of what O'Neal and his dunking buddies might believe, the ability to dominate the developing basketball world is about all Dream Team II has in common with the original, which featured three of the best players in the history of the sport.   \"The ignorance of youth, huh?\" laughed Joe Dumars, when asked about O'Neal's boast. Of Championship Caliber    One of three 30-plus veterans sprinkled about the roster, Dumars is the only United States player who owns an N.B.A. championship ring. The two he won with the Detroit Pistons shrink when matched against the total of 12 the original Dream Team had won by the time of the '92 Olympics, thanks to Magic Johnson's five, Larry Bird's three and the two apiece for Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, who added one more.   Dream Team I players had also won four National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament titles (Johnson, Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Christian Laettner to one for Dream Team I (Larry Johnson). And its coach, Chuck Daly, was a two-time N.B.A. champ while Nelson has never advanced beyond a conference final. Beyond that, the original dreamers had Johnson, as a famous athlete who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and Jordan, who had attained Muhammad Ali-like global prominence. The Olympics were a much bigger stage than the world championships and Dream Team I was breaking new ground.   \"I think that's one of the problems for these young guys now,\" said Dumars. \"The N.B.A. has set such a high standard of excellence for entertainment, and now any perceived drop-off is going to seem much worse than it is.   \"You have to look at these guys differently. Most of them are in their second, third and fourth years. Five years from now, Shaquille will have won a couple of titles. Probably Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning. It's not fair to compare these teams.\" Veteran Leadership    Nonetheless, Dumars and his fellow graybeard Dominique Wilkins ride the bus with O'Neal, Mourning, Derrick Coleman, et al., and can't believe what they hear.   \"I'm kind of caught between the two teams,\" said Dumars. \"I played with the older guys in their primes and now I'm with these guys. Believe me, they have some interesting discussions. Like the other day, Alonzo was talking about scoring down low, about this move and that move.   \"Nique told him, 'No big man had more moves than Kevin McHale.' Then I said, 'That's right, McHale could destroy people on the block.' Alonzo said, 'Destroy? Come on.'   \"I said, 'Yeah, all right. Think what you want.' \" REBOUNDS    Given his predilection for small lineups, DON NELSON's starting lineup for the opener against Spain includes three guards, JOE DUMARS, REGGIE MILLER and KEVIN JOHNSON, and SHAQUILLE O'NEAL and SHAWN KEMP. . . . Nelson named Dumars, LARRY JOHNSON and Miller as tricaptains. . . . The United States is in Pool A, with Brazil, Spain and China.

It said the districts could stand only if the state justified them under strict scrutiny in a full-scale trial.    That command struck many as part of a drive to reverse the dramatic political gains the voting law has brought to citizens long denied both the ballot and a place in American political life.

According to Lincoln Center, 10 million people watched the program, and what they heard and saw was a series of performances that moved from the industrial rhythms of Duke Ellington's \"Happy Go Lucky Local,\" a big-band piece based on the rhythms of a train, to \"Blue Port.\" The latter, an introspective, melancholic and spare piece by Art Farmer on fluegelhorn and Gerry Mulligan on baritone saxophone, backed by Ron Carter on bass and Lewis Nash on drums, was a reprise of a group Mr. Mulligan led in the 1950's.

Classic at Stratton Mountain, Vt. She led Kathy Guadagnino by two shots and Ellie Gibson by three.   King had eight birdies without a bogey as she birdied each of the four par-5 holes. A victory in the 72-hole tournament would qualify King for the Hall of Fame with 30 victories, including two of the four major championships. King has won 29 tournaments, including four majors. (AP) AUTO RACING  Brickyard Pole for Mast  Rick Mast is usually a second banana. He is probably best known for pushing his teammate, Harry Gant, across the finish line to a victory. But the 37-year-old journeyman earned a place in stock car history yesterday, winning the pole position for tomorrow's inaugural Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Mast, whose racing career began at age 15 with the sale of a cow for his first race car surprised about 100,000 spectators -- a Nascar record for a qualifying day -- as the stock cars made their official Indy debut after months of anticipation. Mast turned a lap of 172.414 miles per hour to take the top starting spot for the $3.2 million race, the richest in Nascar history. Six-time and defending Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt took the outside position on the front row with a lap of 171.726 m.p.h. (AP) HORSE RACING  Copper Mount Rallies  Copper Mount, one of the season's stars among 3-year-old colts foaled in New York State, lagged for half a mile, but then made a strong move to the outside at the urging of Julie Krone to win the Albany Handicap at Saratoga yesterday. The horse ran the mile and an eighth in 1:504/5 on a fast track, paid $3.80 for a $2 wager and earned $33,330.    EMPIRE STATE GAMES  Bowser Wins Jump  Ernest Bowser of Uniondale (L.I.)

A manic farce with an absurdly Byzantine plot and minimal psychological shading, this early product of a young playwright has mostly spawned productions that run merrily over the text like a speeding Keystone Kops car. The fact that language and characterization have tended to get lost in the traffic of the stage seems to bother no one. It isn't, after all, something that anyone ever quotes from to impress people.   Now this giddy trollop of a play is getting a little respect. The astonishment of the outdoor production of \"Comedy\" from Shakespeare and Company, the repertory troupe based at the Mount, the former Berkshires estate of Edith Wharton, is that the spoken lines get more laughs than the sight gags.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940805","headline":"Defusing Korea's Nuclear Crisis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/05/opinion/defusing-korea-s-nuclear-crisis.html","abstract":"  he United States resumes high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva today with some hope that the new Korean leadership will stay on a constructive negotiating path.

The mural, however, is also a portrait of Fabian's hometown, and it contains fanciful portraits of some of the town's better-known residents: Botho August, the sullen lighthouse keeper, appears as a sort of dark angel, spreading his wings as he peers down from the topmost window of his lighthouse; Reverend Sillet has levitated to the roof of his church, where he stands perched atop the weathervane, and Helen Twombly, the local eccentric, surfaces as a mermaid in a pretty cove.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940805","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/05/arts/art-in-review-866873.html","abstract":"   'Around the House'   Frumkin/Adams Gallery  50 West 57th Street  Manhattan  Through next Friday    Tranquillity is in short supply in this varied show of works on domestic themes.

What could be more provocative? Mozart, after all, is the symbolic heart of this festival, Salzburg's reigning son. His visage is wrapped around chocolates and peers out from lingerie displays as well as from concert hall posters. When the festival was begun in the 1920's, it was meant to be Salzburg's answer to Bayreuth, replacing Wagner with Mozart, creating a mythic marriage between Austrian music, religion and the life of the people in this beautiful city of Baroque churches.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940806","headline":"Kodak Hasn't Cut All Ties to Tobacco Industry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/06/opinion/l-kodak-hasn-t-cut-all-ties-to-tobacco-industry-879827.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   A July 23 correction on questions raised by New York City pension system trustees about investments in tobacco-related stocks implies the Eastman Kodak Company is no longer connected to the tobacco industry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940806","headline":"Bosnia: Two Right Responses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/06/opinion/bosnia-two-right-responses.html","abstract":"  NATO and the United Nations sent a timely military message to the Bosnian Serbs yesterday.
