When Martin isn't stealing or vandalizing, he repeats a kind of mantra to himself in which he claims to be \"the son of a female shark.\" Someday, he tells himself, he and Simon will disappear into the bottom of the sea, where they will live happily ever after surrounded by dancing fish.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950310","headline":"World's Fair Reflected Late-30's America","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/opinion/l-world-s-fair-reflected-late-30-s-america-929095.html","abstract":"  To the editor:   \"The End of Dignity\" (Op-Ed March 5), criticizing plans to make the American Museum of Natural History \"snazzier,\" proclaims a loss of dignity in museums.

Scoring versatility and depth are two reasons why the Knicks (39-19) find themselves moving in a positive direction. March is a difficult month for many teams, with players fatigued from the long season, and the playoffs still more than a month away. But the Knicks' depth and conditioning allow them to cope with back-to-back games and the rigors of the schedule.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950310","headline":"If It's Tournament Time, Then It's Time for Duke","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/sports/basketball-if-it-s-tournament-time-then-it-s-time-for-duke.html","abstract":"  Atlantic Coast Conference    GREENSBORO, N.C., March 9 -- This was less a return to glory than a successful struggle to subdue a reeling opponent.

Renowned for its innovative shootouts, this mournful, arch-masculine classic is by now associated with a different kind of battle. The fight to release a restored, wide-screen director's cut of \"The Wild Bunch,\" which was rated R in 1969 but barely escaped an NC-17 this year, is more significant to Peckinpah's reputation than the slow-motion blood spurts that once seemed so bold.   Peckinpah's legendary problems with studios, producers, ratings and himself have often obscured the real essence of his work. So has his association with cinematic violence, since two and a half decades have made the much-imitated methods of \"The Wild Bunch\" look almost tame. Audiences for \"Blood of a Poet: The Cinema According to Sam Peckinpah,\" a fascinating and comprehensive three-week retrospective beginning today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, will discover other sides of the Peckinpah mystique.

The analogy of 1960's hair now clipped to lawyer length is tempting, but maybe Mr. Penderecki simply ran out of theatric devices.   This brief piece juxtaposes long viola, cello and violin solos in wide-spaced intervals with pounding string chords, buzzing triplets and busy fugal textures. The \"Sinfonietta\" is well-built music. It never forgets its original premises and refers back to them at the right times.

But because they have no levers, do not require players to insert money and do not return money -- a player's winnings or losses are recorded on computer -- the terminals don't seem to fit the legal definition of a slot machine.

PLEDGE TO FIGHT TERRORISM    Yasir Arafat promised Secretary of State Warren Christopher that he would do his best to prosecute Palestinian terrorists, but he blamed Israel for helping create the groups responsible for terrorism. 5  BOMB ATTACK IN ALGERIA    Hours after a new warning from Islamic militants, a car bomb exploded in Algiers near housing for police officers and their families, wounding at least 63 people. 5  CHINA CONCILIATORY ON RIGHTS    Beijing said it would continue its human rights dialogue with the U.S. despite \"foolish\" attempts to censure China over its rights record. 5  Russia agrees with the I.M.F. on a &#166;6.4 billion loan. 5 The U.S. is suspending the last of its military aid to Guatemala. 3  Liverpool Journal: Big Brother is definitely watching. 4  National 6-9  SHIFT IN C.I.A. NOMINEES    Michael P. C. Carns withdrew as the President's choice for Director of Central Intelligence, and Mr. Clinton immediately chose John M. Deutch, the Deputy Defense Secretary, for the post.  1  DOOMED BY BACKGROUND CHECK    When the F.B.I. background report on General Carns reached the White House, everyone involved decided that the nominee might be dragging too much baggage into hearings before a Republican Congress.  1  APOLOGY FOR A DOOMED IDEAL    On the 30th anniversary of the Selma march, George Wallace, one-time nemesis of the civil rights movement, offered words of conciliation to those he had oppressed while Governor of Alabama.  1  JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 5.4%    An unexpectedly large number of Americans found new jobs in February, as the unemployment rate matched a four-year low, dropping three-tenths of a point to 5.4 percent. Financial traders rushed exuberantly to buy American assets. 1  CIVIL-SUIT LIMITS PASS    In an effort to discourage lawsuits, the House easily passed a measure that would set standards and curtail damage awards in civil courts.  1  PRIDE OF MAINE, ON COURT OR OFF    The best athlete in the Maine is a home-bred female basketball player for the Black Bears of the University of Maine.  6  REVERSAL ON NUCLEAR WASTES    In a second tribal vote, the Mescalero Apaches of New Mexico reversed their January decision against storing nuclear waste on their land.  6  TESTIMONY ON SIMPSON'S BRONCO    A detective testified about a puzzling array of items found in O.

This was the first concrete indication that Republican senators, like their House counterparts, intended to follow up on their repeated demands for a balanced Federal budget with an actual plan to achieve it.  And it placed the political onus on the Senate's Democrats, who complained only Wednesday that Republican budget policy was all talk and no action.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950311","headline":"March Is Always a Maddening Time for Huskies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/11/sports/college-basketball-march-is-always-a-maddening-time-for-huskies.html","abstract":"  The glass is always half-empty in Connecticut in March. That is the reality confronting the Huskies, the team that has finished alone in first in consecutive Big East regular seasons at a time when that unprecedented accomplishment is somehow considered moot. They stepped carefully into a new, uncertain season yesterday with an 81-78 victory over Pittsburgh in the quarterfinal round of the Big East tournament, an outcome that created more questions than it answered.    Connecticut's businesslike approach could lead the Huskies to look back on a 4-point deficit with 4 minutes to play -- and the possibility of a fourth quarterfinal defeat in the last five tournaments -- and the clear-minded response that allowed them to avoid a crisis. \"We don't have any mottos about not losing,\" said Donny Marshall, whose 22 points included 10 of 12 free throws. \"Our play just shows we don't want to lose.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950311","headline":"Revival Of 'Rune,' An Exception","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/11/arts/dance-review-revival-of-rune-an-exception.html","abstract":"  He could have called it \"Shapes in Space\" or \"Stops and Starts.\" Either title would have been appropriate. But when Merce Cunningham choreographed a new dance back in 1959, he chose \"Rune\" for its title.

The work was seen for the first time since 1983 in an impressive revival by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company on Thursday night at the City Center.

Before he came to Rutgers, Mr. Lawrence had used affirmative action to bring about a tenfold increase in the black student enrollment at Tulane; how, then, could he have told an audience in New Jersey that minority students lack the \"genetic hereditary background\" to do well on college entrance exams?\n\nThe widespread puzzlement over that apparent contradiction tells us a lot about the way people think about race and affirmative action. The university's Board of Governors embraced Mr. Lawrence's record and played down his statement, saying it was out of character, a slip, at odds with his clear convictions. Many of Rutgers's black students said the statement simply revealed his true self. The differences in their conclusions aside, both sides relied on the same assumption: Belief in black inferiority and support for affirmative action can't coexist because they don't fit together.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950311","headline":"Religion Journal; Grand Plans to Tell a Billion About Jesus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/11/us/religion-journal-grand-plans-to-tell-a-billion-about-jesus.html","abstract":"  Over a career that began when Harry S.

How can it not be? Architecture is a social art. To a more or less conspicuous degree, every building bears the imprint of the social contract. And last November's elections expressed a national desire to renegotiate the terms of that contract.  Sooner or later, that desire will express itself in built form. If things go according to the Contract With America, architects can at least look forward to a brisk trade designing prisons.   A correctional facility may not be every architect's idea of a dream commission, but it could stand as a good symbol for the grim mood in which much of the profession now finds itself. Thus far, the 90's have not been golden years for architecture. Many architects were thrown out of work by the recession and remain underemployed, at least by standards of the 1980's. Some feel cut adrift by the absence of a unifying ideology or style. Others are feeling displaced by the exaggerated claims for cyberspace and virtual reality: will buildings be reduced to mere pit stops on the information highway? Above all, perhaps, many feel let down by the Clinton Administration and its failure to bring architects together behind a compelling urban vision.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Topiaries And Teapots, And a Tide Of Visitors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/topiaries-and-teapots-and-a-tide-of-visitors.html","abstract":"  Building from a steady trickle to a mid-day stream to an afternoon raging river, New Yorkers yesterday descended on their newest commercial bauble, Crate and Barrel, a furniture and housewares superstore at Madison Avenue and 59th Street.

It was the first night after Tet, the lunar new year, and although Communist attacks the night before had caused the official annual Tet cease-fire to be canceled, the city was full of visitors celebrating the holiday. Like the rest, Sau and his friends had come to town by bus or on foot, carrying holiday packages. But Nguyen Van Sau and the others were not in Saigon to celebrate. They were members of Sapper Battalion C-10 of the Vietcong and their packages were weapons.    Sau had grown up illiterate in Cu Chi Province, just outside the capital. In the National Liberation Front, he had learned to read and write, and had been instructed in the front's version of exalted patriotism. As a special honor, he was invited to join the Communist Party. And now he had been singled out again. The men and women of Sapper Battalion C-10 were going to attack the United States Embassy.     At around 2:45 A.M., their little convoy set out. It consisted of two vehicles: an old Peugeot van and a taxi of the same make, both familiar vehicles on Saigon streets. The embassy was a fortress, nearly new, a $2.5 million complex that fairly dominated downtown Saigon. Its key buildings featured shatterproof plexiglass, and the entire compound was surrounded by an eight-foot wall.    Shortly before 3 A.M., the guerrillas in the taxi opened fire on the military police post at the main entrance. The M.P.'s returned fire and slammed shut and padlocked the steel gate. The Vietcong in the van, which stopped around the corner, used an antitank explosive to breach the wall. In seconds a commando squad of about two dozen was pouring through it. The two M.P.'s turned to face them. The first American to die was Specialist 4 Charles L. Daniel of Durham, N.C. He and his partner, Pfc. William Sebast of Albany, fell defending their positions, and their refusal to yield or withdraw probably spoiled the attack.    U.S. reinforcements were soon brought to bear, and the battle for the embassy grounds went on through the night. By around 9 A.M., all of the attackers had been killed or captured. The American dead consisted of the two M.P.'s and one marine. The Communists had failed to gain entrance to a single building.    Up until that point in the war, nearly 20,000 Americans had died along with hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. More than 58,000 Americans and an estimated four million Vietnamese -- soldiers and civilians -- would die before it was over.    During the early hours of Jan. 31, 1968, there was fierce fighting in Saigon and all over Vietnam. But the attack on the embassy, in its quixotic effrontery, was perhaps the engagement that most fascinated the world.   In January, I spent a few days in Saigon, which is now called Ho Chi Minh City, just as Sixth Avenue in New York is formally called the Avenue of the Americas. It was coming up on Tet and everyone was buying presents; people were carrying little potted tangerine trees and apricot flowers, and visitors from up north were carrying peach boughs and blossoms, which don't grow in the southern part of the country.    The town was booming as never before. Foreign businessmen, including plenty of Americans, were everywhere. On the roof of the Rex, the hotel that once was the American bachelor officers' quarters, tourists and local plutocrats were dining on frogs' legs. The old gourmet restaurants are gone, but new ones seem to be opening every day.    On what was the Rue Catinat before it was Tu Do Street, before it was Dong Khoi Street, antique porcelain and jewelry are for sale to prosperous buyers. Visitors can buy silk dresses, made to measure by shops whose employees will gladly stitch through the night to have the garments ready first thing in the morning.     Diners at the Rex can watch the streets below illuminated by Toshiba and Sony neon signs that turn night into day. A few old billboards enjoin Marxist morality -- one condemns bootlegging -- but the touts and the girls and the transvestites are all back in the same old places.     What would it be like to take a walk around town with Specialist Daniel, Private Sebast and Nguyen Van Sau and his comrades of C-10 one of these lovely holiday evenings, 27 years after the attack that killed them? Would they guess who had won the war in which they died? Surely the Americans would have thought it was their side. And Sau might be amazed at the fruits of the Communists' victory.    Vietnamese Communism was not going to threaten Durham, N.C., as the men who recruited young Daniel doubtless assured him it was. It was not even going to trouble Saigon all that long.    Nor was the earth about to rise on new foundations for Sau, although he might take some comfort in the new name for the G.I.s' old haunt, Tu Do Street.     Dong Khoi, formerly Tu Do, the street where you get the antique jewelry and porcelain, means Spontaneous Uprising -- presumably the one Sau and his friends waited all night in vain for in 1968. Although the uprising never came, they changed the street name anyhow. That's how politicians are.     Today, many a deal is in the making. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, new factories will soon make Wisk liquid soap and Sunlight detergent for the Vietnamese kitchen. And before long, there will be a new U.S. embassy in Hanoi.     How ironic it all is. Perhaps such a squandering of young lives ought to be consigned to the realm of private grief, reflecting more shame than glory on the causes served. Yet we find ourselves moved and inspired by the heroism of young people who do their duty, who serve with all the vigor of their youth, strength and courage. The political futility of their sacrifice gives it a poignancy that is somehow ennobling. Even the Hemingway of \"A Farewell to Arms,\" professing revulsion at the rhetoric of heroism, movingly employed it and became the high priest of martial virtue.    After a period of denial and ambiguity, the United States began erecting fitting monuments to the Americans who died in our futile war. Somehow we can't keep ourselves from honoring those who give their lives in the wars to which our shortsightedness and folly consign them. Yet we know that in every war lives are lost, meaninglessly, and that the cause behind their sacrifice is soon rendered irrelevant.     We have never succeeded in replacing proper conduct on the field of battle as the ultimate measure of courage and loyalty. We have not developed that \"moral equivalent of war\" that William James so wisely and impossibly called for. Knowing not a whit more than the ancient Greeks, we console ourselves as they did in catharsis, in stoic acceptance and tragic ritual. Our celebration of death in battle is, from a certain perspective, utterly irrational. Yet it is our only means of imposing some degree of meaning on war's meaningless destruction, the only way we have of facing the eternal ironies of history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Sandra Milberg, David H.

When the English actress Fanny Kemble visited the town (\"the oldest I have yet seen in America\") in 1838, she wrote, \"The appearance of the city is highly picturesque, a word which can apply to none other of the American towns.\" The residents agree. Long before the Civil War threatened their cherished way of life, Charlestonians were notoriously attached to their past.\n\nLuckily for both visitors and local people, the object of their affections is astonishingly present, despite war, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. Charleston is shaped like a big toe wading into the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, and its oldest section (traditionally but too strictly limited to the streets \"south of Broad\"), at its tip, offers the opposite of Rip Van Winkle's experience. The visitor is modern but steps mysteriously into a late-18th-century-early-19th-century town of two- to three-story buildings, the low skyline interrupted only by church spires. Built tight to the sidewalk in a variety of styles and materials, the buildings keep surprisingly harmonious company. Even more unexpectedly, there is very little that feels phony or trapped-in-amber about Charleston's Historic District: the basketball net in front of the undulating wrought-iron fence at 36 Meeting Street (circa 1740) is typical of the area's convincingly lived-in look.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"'In the Natural State' And Hunting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/l-in-the-natural-state-and-hunting-107495.html","abstract":"  Re the Jan. 29 letter to the New Jersey editor by Gloria J.

Its goal, said Adele Dowling, public information officer, is \"to create a better awareness of department programs, services and facilities, to increase attendance and revenues and to develop cross-marketing techniques using existing revenues.\" In other words, to promote activities heavily, while spending virtually nothing more than the cost of printing a few extra brochures -- and that money will come from within the department.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Fleet Street Is Once Again On Barricades","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/world/fleet-street-is-once-again-on-barricades.html","abstract":"  After reading reviews of his performance, a comic actor and writer developed such a paralyzing case of stage fright that he walked out of the West End play and boarded a ferry for the Continent.

Music, ordinarily resilient to historical turmoil, bears deep and lasting scars. Half a century ago, Anton Webern was shot outside his Austrian home by an American soldier; the Czech composers Viktor Ullmann, Pavel Haas and Gideon Klein were killed at Auschwitz; and Bela Bartok died in New York, an impoverished exile. This year also happens to be the centenary of the German composer Carl Orff, whose music has been seriously compromised by Nazi associations. Haunted by these intrusions of reality into utopian musical life, the European music festivals this summer take on a darkly reflective tone.   The most ambitious of the war remembrances takes place in Dresden, a city that has not yet recovered fully from the Allied firebombing campaign of February 1945. Its offerings include Benjamin Britten's noble \"War Requiem\"; Bernd Alois Zimmermann's opera \"Die Soldaten,\" a scalding vision of the horror of war; and Richard Strauss's \"Friedenstag,\" a more ambiguous and dubious plea for peace first heard under Nazi auspices in 1938. The theme at Matthias Bamert's Lucerne Festival is \"Misunderstood Music,\" missing pieces of 20th-century musical history. Two potential highlights are a program of music by Ber thold Goldschmidt, a composer who fell into obscurity with the onset of the Nazi regime but continued to write music in England (Aug. 19); and a concert by the Czech Philharmonic in honor of Viktor Ullmann, who led a Jewish musical community at the Theresienstadt concentration camp (Sept. 2).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"A Brawl, Occasionally Interrupted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-village-a-brawl-occasionally-interrupted.html","abstract":"  A husky man pummels a slighty built younger man, hurling him into a garage door.

DOROTHEA LANGE: A Visual Life (Smithsonian Institution, cloth, $55; paper, $24.95) includes scholarly essays and personal remembrances about Lange (1895-1965) -- the feminist heroine; the wife, lover and mother; the photographer of Japanese internment camps for the War Relocation Authority. There is also an interview with Ansel Adams, with whom Lange worked. (The editor, Elizabeth Partridge, as a youngster knew Lange intimately.) The longest and most interesting essay, by Sally Stein, who teaches art history at the University of California, Irvine, focuses on Lange's disability -- a lifelong limp as a result of childhood polio -- and its influence on her portraits. Lange often dropped down to focus on hands in relation to torso, or even lower to the position of the legs and feet. The most fascinating texts in the book, however, are Lange's, in a chapter entitled \"Dorothea Lange: Her Words and Images,\" and that of her oldest son, Daniel Dixon. He writes that his mother \"never described herself as an artist\" but as \"a 'witness,' an 'observer.' \" Lange was an artist, and the many photographs included here, some of her best known as well as more obscure images, bear witness to that fact.\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950312","headline":"Incivility: To Act or Not to Act?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/nyregion/l-incivility-to-act-or-not-to-act-924595.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your article reminded me of one of my students who is 9.
