His dissent in a local rape case became law in 1957 when the Supreme Court, anticipating its own Miranda ruling of 1966, unanimously threw out a confession obtained during an unlawful arrest.

Boston University's 7-6 overtime triumph at Orono on Friday ended Maine's undefeated status this season after 32 games, 30 of them victories. Also concluding were unbeaten streaks of 50 games (46-0-4) at home; 44 regular-season games (40-0-4) and 33 contests (30-0-3) against Hockey East opponents.     Mike Prendergast, Boston University's sophomore forward from South Boston, who had been out a month because of a knee injury, ended all that when his shot went by Mike Dunham at 1 minute 50 seconds of overtime. Dunham, a United States Olympian a year ago, had been unbeaten for Maine in his last 24 games. The Terriers overcame a 6-2 deficit.    The next night Maine won, 6-1, and the two referees, Frank Cole and Drew Taylor, called 51 penalties for a total of 150 minutes, both Hockey East records. There were six 10-minute misconduct penalties, all in the third period. Four Maine goals came on power plays.   The Terriers never stopped Paul Kariya, Maine's celebrated freshman, who had seven assists in the two games. Kariya has 44 assists for 58 points, a 2.9 average, in 20 league games. Penalties? One, for two minutes.   Rankings   The voters in The Albany Times Union's poll, 12 coaches and 13 news media representatives, still like Maine. The Black Bears gained 24 first-place votes. The other vote went to No. 2 Michigan. Harvard is No. 3; Miami of Ohio, No. 4 and Boston University, No. 5.    Then come Minnesota-Duluth, No. 6; Lake Superior State, No. 7; Wisconsin, No. 8; Rensselaer, No. 9, and Clarkson and Minnesota tied for No. 10.     The poll ran counter to the Central Association standing, which finds Miami of Ohio continuing in first place with a 3-point lead over Lake Superior State and Michigan. The latter two meet on Friday at Ann Arbor, Mich. Women's Tournament  College hockey for women is making steady progress, according to Heather Linstad, the Northeastern coach. \"The caliber of players is improving,\" she said. \"And there are many more opportunties, like our national team and participation in the Olympic festival.\"    The Eastern College Athletic Association is sponsoring its first women's tournament, which begins tonight with St. Lawrence (6-6) at New Hampshire (10-4-2) and Princeton (8-7-2) at Northeastern (9-4-2). Rensselaer  The Engineers are a team to watch as the playoffs near. They have won 9 of their last 11 games, which included Harvard's only league defeat. The defense that supports goalie Neil Little gave up more than three goals only once, a 5-2 loss to Vermont.   Rensselaer, second behind Harvard in the ECAC standing and 1 point ahead of Yale, next plays ninth-place Colgate and 11th-place Cornell at home, while the slumping Bulldogs are at Clarkson and St. Lawrence. SUNY Tournament  Plattsburgh's Cardinals, the defending Division III champions, swept through the State University of New York league with an 11-0-1 record.    Next comes a four-team tournament Friday and Saturday in a two-game format, with 10-minute mini-games to break ties. Oswego State (12-12-1 over all and 5-7-0 in the conference) plays at Plattsburgh (19-4-2, 11-0-1), and Fredonia (11-13-1, 7-4-1) visits Cortland State (17-7-0, 8-4-0). Saves  The largest regular-season crowd in college hockey history, 18,275 spectators at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena, saw Michigan rout Michigan State, 11-1, on Jan. 30. . . . Iona has clinched first place in the ECAC South group and will be the host team for a playoff game at Rye's Playland Casino on March 3 against an opponent to be named.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930224","headline":"India at the Edge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/24/opinion/india-at-the-edge.html","abstract":"  A million Hindu protesters are poised to defy an official ban and pour through the streets of New Delhi toward India's Parliament tomorrow.

It should be said at once, before those issues are broached, that Crawford deserves the attention. Her few works achieve a sharply individual tone, a singular blend of lyrical grace and modernist violence.    \"American Visionary\" was the tag that Cheryl Seltzer and Joel Sachs, Continuum's directors, chose for the evening. For once, the phrase applies.  Crawford makes nonsense of the standard chronology of 20th-century music. Her early works inhabit a lushly dissonant medium derived not from Schoenberg but from Scriabin.  The violin sonata of 1926, performed by Renee Jolles (violinist) and Ms. Seltzer (pianist), opens with stark dissonances but finds an ecstatic lyrical tone. It sounds like no other American work of the period.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930224","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/24/style/chronicle-351693.html","abstract":"  If William Howard Taft, Mr. Bush and, as of Monday, GERALD R.

WITH: Joanne Camp, Celeste Ciulla, Sheri Galan, Robert Hock, Bella Jarrett, Seth Jones and Sean Pratt.   After 315 years, Racine's tragedy about the ancient Greek queen Phaedra retains an emotional and intellectual power that sends one away from a performance personally troubled. And the Pearl Theater Company's production of a version by the British actress Margaret Rawlings is a reminder that this great work of France's greatest tragedian can even survive translation from magnificent 17th-century couplets into simple modern English, and a performance that deliberately avoids the grand declamatory style of classic French theater.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930224","headline":"Watch Out For Trickle-Down Technology","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/24/opinion/watch-out-for-trickledown-technology.html","abstract":"Bill Clinton spent much of the Presidential campaign attacking the trickle-down economic policies of the Reagan-Bush years.
