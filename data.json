Charles Oakley was ejected. But thanks to Patrick Ewing, who made a game-deciding 12-foot fadeaway jumper with 10.8 seconds to play, the Knicks managed to escape Madison Square Garden with a 107-104 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of their three-of-five-game playoff series last night.

Squandering a 19-point third-quarter lead, the Knicks found themselves nervously finishing a game that many people expected them to waltz through. New York won 60 games this season, while the Pacers (41-41) barely made the playoffs as the eighth-seeded team in the East.

Hogue injured the knuckle twice in the first-round series against the Washington Capitals, which the Islanders won, four games to two. The first injury came in Game 3 when Washington's Kevin Hatcher slashed him. Ed Tyburski, the Islanders' trainer, said there was no fracture but said the knuckle has an arthritic condition.

Yet this \"Beauty\" also serves as a school or training ground for classical dancing. Principals and soloists mature in roles that are more difficult than they seem and debuts are ceaseless.

Three defiant members of the organization were injured in the attack, which sent bystanders fleeing. The incident drew more attention to the Latin Kings, an organization of Hispanic and Italian men and women founded four years ago within the state's prison system. Over the last two years authorities have linked the band to scores of assaults and at least six homicides. As reports of the group's activities surfaced in the news media, Beatrice Codianni of New Haven, a longtime supporter of grass roots politics, took note. What she read and heard, she said, mirrored the days when she worked with the Black Panthers in the late 1960's and witnessed the Federal Bureau of Investigation discredit the organization by circulating distorted information to the public.   The same pattern was occurring with the Latin Kings, which was a relatively young organization in Connecticut having what Ms. Codianni called positive goals. Though she recognized that the group had a violent element, she said she had also seen how it had changed the lives of people like her 21-year-old son Andrew, by steering him away from drugs and giving him a strict moral code to live by. In May of last year Ms. Codianni began corresponding with Pedro Millan, one of the founders of the Latin Kings who is currently awaiting trial in a state prison on conspiracy charges stemming from the Meriden shootout. She suggested to him that the Latin Kings begin a public campaign to change their image, and that they begin by offering AIDS education along with literacy and high school classes to its members. Ms. Codianni soon after joined the organization and now serves on the board of directors, making her one of the Latin Kings highest ranking members.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"In Brooklyn's District 15, Divisions of the City Are Reflected in the Campaign","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/in-brooklyn-s-district-15-divisions-of-the-city-are-reflected-in-the-campaign.html","abstract":"  Six months ago, the board of School District 15 in Brooklyn so angered some parents by approving a modified version of the Rainbow Curriculum that the police had to escort board members out when their meeting ended.

To understand it is not necessarily to love it. Still, as the work of an architect who has labored long, and with notable success, to pitch his ideas beyond mortal understanding, the viewer-friendly Greater Columbus Convention Center comes as a pleasant surprise. Visitors familiar with Eisenman's past enigmas -- staircases stuck to the ceiling or leading to a blank wall -- may find themselves bowled over by waves of gratitude. Fortunately, legibility isn't all this building has going for it. It brings a brash, poetic order to a chaotic urban landscape, shaping a middle ground between a city and the forces that threaten it. Plus, it's got snazzy looks.   Ten years ago, opacity was Eisenman's pure delight. His exercises in abstract form did not just ignore the usual conventions of function, context and meaning. They deliberately thwarted those conventions. Their function was to have no function; their meaning was to be meaningless; they arose within the context of no context. Eisenman has not abandoned his fascination with abstract forms. The Convention Center is a formally exuberant building. What he has abandoned, at least for now, is the adolescent idea that conventions are the enemy of architecture. He's discovered that conventions can be played with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"Gymru and Cymru and All That","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/travel/gymru-and-cymru-and-all-that.html","abstract":"THE most intimate way to experience a country is through its language.

As a corporate pilot for Primerica and most recently Dun & Bradstreet, Mr. Milano has flown around the world half a dozen times as captain of Gulfstream and Falcon jets. And because of his flexible schedule as a corporate pilot, in which he flies only 8 to 11 days a month, he has had time to develop a business of his own, Ardsley Mobil Automotive Service Center, which he says is the only high-technology service station of its kind in Westchester.    \"What gives us that distinction is a brake-testing machine I had installed after I bought the station seven years ago,\" Mr. Milano said. \"It is an extremely sophisticated and expensive piece of equipment, which cost us $35,000, but technically it is the state of the art,\" he said. \"This level of equipment isn't for the average service station, but we wanted to attract demanding customers. We excel in Jaguar repairs, and I thought it would be a great marketing tool. There are only four machines of its kind in all of New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\"    For the mechanically ungifted, Mr. Milano described the brake tester as \"a computerized machine that literally gives customers an 'EKG' profile of their cars.\" The process is the same, he said. \"When the car goes up on the rack, the brake tester makes a diagnosis in as little as a minute. But in that time the car is weighed. The wheel alignment on all four wheels is checked; the brake-system performance is analyzed, and then all the information is cranked out in a computerized report.\"  Satisfaction and Profitability    The printouts, he said, which are given to the customer, enable them to monitor their car's performance.    \"There are a lot of things that can go wrong with a car,\" he said. \"If a customer is driving to Florida, for instance, and has car trouble, the print-out contains valuable information that will be useful to a strange mechanic.\"    The brake tester, he said, is paying its way in customer satisfaction and profitability. \"It yields so much important information that even car dealers and other service stations bring in their cars to us for a testing.\"    Customers having work done on their cars are not charged extra for an inspection on the brake tester, Mr. Milano said, but someone wanting only a checkup would be charged $40 plus tax. The hourly labor rate varies from $65 to $75 depending on how \"exotic\" the car is.   Mr. Milano, who is 35, said he has been working at the station in one guise or another more than half his life. \"When I was in school I had a part-time job there,\" he said. \"The station is a landmark in Ardsley. There has been a service station on the same corner since 1926. It was previously known as the F.H.L. Service station when it was owned by Floyd Lichtenberg, when I was a kid. Many years later I bought it from Mr. Lichtenberg.\"  A Changing Industry    But, he said, the station he worked in as a teen-ager bears little resemblance to the one today. \"Those 'Gasoline Alley' days are gone,\" Mr. Milano added. \"I remember when I was in high school, everybody with even a slight mechanical bent used to tinker with their cars. But today, you can't monkey with a car. It's even impossible to change carburetors because high-tech computer microprocessors control their function.\"    A few years after he bought the station, Mr. Milano said, he realized the best way to keep business growing was to upgrade the service. \"The industry was changing,\" he said. \"It was becoming so specialized that technicians were needed to service cars instead of mechanics. It was expand or die. We decided to expand.\"    Using their own money, Mr. Milano and his wife, Isabel, who is his partner and takes care of the bookkeeping and business end of the business, invested about $750,000 to remodel the 5,000-square-foot building with five king-size bays.    \"At the station we only do mechanical work,\" Mr. Milano said. \"We're set up like a dealership in that every car we work on gets dealer parts, and every car we service is tested on the brake machine for free.\"  Jaguars a Specialty    Customers come from all over the county and include many Jaguar owners. \"Jaguars once had a bad rap for always being in the shop,\" Mr. Milano said. \"But they have been vastly improved. We service both the brand-new models and the classics. We even find original parts for the classics, but like any other high-powered car, they both need periodic checkups. The way I started servicing Jaguars is that some of the executives I fly for brought their Jaguars in, and through word of mouth other Jaguar owners followed.\"   In addition to the equipment that he has installed, Mr. Milano employs 21 technicians. \"They receive ongoing training weekly at an automotive facility,\" he said. \"They also have a library of service manuals, electronic technical service bulletins and access to a technical hot-line service.\"   He continued: \"We're not talking about mechanics, but highly skilled, highly educated individuals who are looking not for jobs but careers here. They earn $35,000 at the beginning and can work up to $70,000 with full benefits included.\"  Fascination With Jet Engines    The connection between his own two careers, he said, is his mechanical ability. \"It was the mechanical aspects of flying more than the romantic idea that attracted me,\" he said. After graduating from St. John's University in Queens, with a bachelor's degree in administration, Mr. Milano continued his studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla. \"Embry-Riddle is known as the Harvard of the aeronautics industry,\" he said. \"I went there because I was fascinated with jet engines.\"    Two years later, Mr. Milano graduated with an associate degree and received a license as a commercial pilot and flight instructor.    \"My first job was with a Cessna dealer teaching classes of 10 students how to fly,\" he said.  Victims of the Recession    The planes he flies for corporate clients have all been based in hangars at Westchester County Airport.    \"What isn't common knowledge is that the Westchester Airport is the largest corporate jetport in the world,\" he said. \"And when it comes to the travel activities of executives, corporations prefer to keep a low profile.\"    Recently, he said, more than one corporate jet had become a victim of the recession. \"When corporations have to cut back, the $30 million jet may be one of the first things to go,\" he said. \"A lot of corporations are using commercial airlines today, which is another reason I am very glad to have a business. We expect to do $1.5 million to $2 million in sales this year, which is up 20 percent from last year's figures.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"NEW JERSEY GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/new-jersey-guide.html","abstract":"JAZZ HALL OF FAME\n\nCab Calloway, Danny Barker and Jonah Jones are among the musicians who will be inducted into the American Jazz Hall of Fame, and they have been invited to attend the ceremony and concert this evening at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"Elizabeth Bishop's Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/books/l-elizabeth-bishop-s-art-481593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Richard Tillinghast, in his review of \"Elizabeth Bishop,\" by Brett C.

On the merits, the vote should go to Carl McCall, president of New York City's Board of Education. He has performed sensibly and responsibly in that difficult role, and that performance argues for the challenge of higher office.   Gov. Mario Cuomo's backing for Mr. McCall raises the issue of independence. A Democratic comptroller must be just as independent from Democratic governors and legislators as Mr. Regan was in auditing state accounts and investing pension funds.

In contrast to the bedlam of a rock concert, the atmosphere at a classical concert was tranquil and civilized. Year after year, concert halls mailed out tasteful, boring brochures, and subscribers dutifully mailed back their checks. Classical-music executives were stuffy little men in dark suits who kept their jobs for life; the moguls of the pop world went to work wearing T-shirts and sneakers, although when their products fell to the bottom of the charts, they were out of work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930502","headline":"IN THE NATURAL STATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/02/nyregion/in-the-natural-state.html","abstract":"AFTER dinner, while Jay made good his offer to do the dishes, Bill, Tom and I stepped out of the clubhouse and into the night.

For her return engagement to the club, Miss Caven has peeled off most of the makeup and has polished her singing.

Miss Caven's opening-night performance on Tuesday, for an engagement that extends through Saturday, was completely riveting. Backed by a quartet that included piano, violin, saxophone and bass, she sang a largely German program that featured songs by Peer Raben (who composed the music for many films by the director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, to whom Miss Caven was briefly married) and J. J. Schuhl.

Mr. Watson, known as a saxophonist and composer, had big-band aspirations, not a fruitful thing to have, given jazz's generally enfeebled economic situation. The concert, often brilliant, looked as if it was set to go down in legend, a one-time event making Mr. Watson one of those rare jazz composers lucky enough to hear their music played by a large ensemble, if only for one night. With big bands seemingly relegated to the dustbin of history, the music was destined for the security of Mr. Watson's desk drawer.   But the current jazz renaissance has had all sorts of salutary effects, not the least of which is a flowering, albeit small, of interest in big-band music among both audiences and musicians. Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall both have jazz orchestras; Jimmy Heath and Slide Hampton have started large ensembles recently, and Wynton Marsalis moves closer to fronting a big band every year. Illinois Jacquet's orchestra was one of the highlights of the 1980's, and the American Jazz Orchestra, David Murray's big band and Clifford Jordan's orchestra have all offered exceptional music.

It also eases the danger that Mr. Clinton's action might misfire and undermine his already shaky political position at home.   The accent was on the negative in Washington today, with warnings from the President, Vice President Al Gore and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the capital's principal Republican spokesman, that \"other agreements in this protracted war have raised hopes but not changed behavior,\" as Mr. Clinton put it. All three said Serbian deeds, not promises, were needed before there could be any relaxation in the search for peace. The Heat Is Still On    Because it believes the threat of military action by the West, along with pressure from Moscow, produced today's potential breakthrough in negotiations, the Administration vowed to continue its preparations for intervention. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is visiting European capitals, was instructed to keep pressing for British and French support for air strikes and for the end of the arms embargo against the hard-pressed Muslims in Bosnia.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"To Get to the Preakness, Just Follow Sea Hero's Lead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/sports/horse-racing-to-get-to-the-preakness-just-follow-sea-hero-s-lead.html","abstract":"  Sea Hero, the only horse in the world with a chance to win racing's Triple Crown in 1993, came out of the Kentucky Derby in good shape, his trainer reported today.

This week's prime exhibit is \"Murder in the Heartland,\" a four-hour, two-part movie being broadcast at 9 P.M. on ABC tonight and tomorrow. This is the story of Charles Starkweather, a 19-year-old psychopath who in 1958 killed 11 people in Nebraska. As ABC puts it, virtually salivating, it was \"one of the most sensational murder rampages in American history.\" In short, perfect for television entertainment.    Thinly fictionalized, the Starkweather story was the inspiration for the 1973 Terrence Malick film \"Badlands,\" which, like \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" is one of those gorgeously produced but fuzzy movie exercises elevating thugs into national myths. \"Murder in the Heartland\" isn't even that ambitious, though there are allusions to the story's Eisenhower era and, apparently, a kind of sociocultural repression ready to explode. Police officers are depicted, for the most part, as morons.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"A Breakthrough on Bosnia?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/opinion/a-breakthrough-on-bosnia.html","abstract":"  President Clinton's escalation of pressure on the Serbs to make peace in Bosnia appears to be yielding encouraging results. In the most hopeful sign in months, the recalcitrant leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has signed the international peace plan designed to end fighting in the Balkans.    If the Serbs really mean to halt their genocidal onslaught, this is indeed a diplomatic triumph. Under the peace plan approved yesterday in Greece, the Bosnian Serbs would be forced to yield roughly a third of the territory they have seized and would be denied the corridors they seek to link Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"For Yankees, Victory Is a Walk in the Park","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/sports/baseball-for-yankees-victory-is-a-walk-in-the-park.html","abstract":"  Here was the classic Little League confrontation at Yankee Stadium: a shy batter, reluctant to swing at intimidating pitches with the bases loaded, the score tied and two outs in an extra inning.   \"It was the first time in my life I've seen a hitter get up with the bases loaded in the last inning with no intention of swinging the bat,\" said Norm Charlton, the bully, the Seattle pitcher.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"New York's School Election: What Do We Want for Our Kids?; Fight the Moral Decay","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/opinion/l-new-york-s-school-election-what-do-we-want-for-our-kids-fight-the-moral-decay-221593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Juxtaposing your extremely moving \"Children of the Shadows\" series with several recent news articles on the controversy over the involvement of the \"religious right\" in the forthcoming New York City school board elections, I perceive a useful lesson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930503","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/03/nyregion/chronicle-984293.html","abstract":"  They are improbable partners: KURT VONNEGUT and Igor Stravinsky, but their words and music will come together on Thursday at Alice Tully Hall at the premiere of a new version of \"L'Histoire du Soldat\" by the New York Philomusica Chamber Ensemble.
