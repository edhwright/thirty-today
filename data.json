It was certainly so for the Spaniards who passed through the Borrego Desert on their way from Sonora to San Francisco, and for the gold-dreamers who later made this a route from East to West. Even today, a motorist traveling these roads is daunted by the prospect of actually getting out of the car; the vast expanses, the big sky and the paucity of vegetation make it seem easier to just keep going.\n\nThis forbidding landscape has been a mixed blessing for the little town of Borrego Springs, which sits in an oasis of low-key commerce, completely surrounded by Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Unlike Palm Springs, its prosperous neighbor 90 miles to the north, Borrego Springs is not served by any major highway; the closest Interstate access is Route 8, about an hour's drive to the south.

It was not an easy task. As a native of the Pacific Northwest, where it can rain 150 inches a year on the coast, and evergreen forests are so thick they create their own climate, I was raised on a sylvan image of natural beauty. The desert, bald and arid, was like a foreign language.    There were knockout views, a moonrise over the purple-hued Panamint Range in Death Valley, late light on the rock slabs of Joshua Tree, and odd-shaped freaks of dry-country evolution darting in and out of burrows. The winter sun, a breakfast of palm dates and fresh scones, fuschia-colored cliffs -- all of it was memorable. Still, the desert of southern California, the nation's largest single expanse of parkland and wilderness in the contiguous 48 states after an act of Congress last fall gave most of it protected status, remained something of a stranger. Then I went to the Kelso Dunes, a wind-sculptured sand monument in the middle of the Mojave National Preserve, which is sandwiched between the two new national parks of Death Valley and Joshua Tree.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Survivors of Negro League Reaping the Benefits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/sports/sports-business-survivors-of-negro-league-reaping-the-benefits.html","abstract":"  There was more than a little historical irony last week when Major League Baseball presented checks worth $143,248 to benefit surviving Negro League players and their legacy.

Studies have shown that it contains phenylethylamine, a chemical stimulant, which is released by the brain in a passionate love affair. Perhaps that explains why so many people eat chocolate on Valentine's Day (conversely, those who fall out of love have lower levels of phenylethylamine, which may explain why they often go on a chocolate binge). In any event, there are few better ways to end a Valentine's Day dinner than with a dessert made from chocolate.    I like chocolate desserts that are fairly straightforward, and not too sweet. A dark, moist chocolate cake, unadorned by creams or icings, is one of my favorites. I also love a hot chocolate souffle, something I like to order in French restaurants when they have it on the menu. Making a hot souffle at home, however, is not difficult if you have a reliable oven. It is important to use egg whites at room temperature, since they will expand more when they are beaten and help the souffle rise. They should be whisked until they form glossy peaks, not over-beaten or over-folded, or the souffle will be flat. Care should also be taken when melting chocolate. It turns into a solid lump if the heat is too high. Melt it in a slow oven or a double boiler.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Last Refuge of Smokers: Very Small Restaurants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/travel/travel-advisory-last-refuge-of-smokers-very-small-restaurants.html","abstract":"  For travelers who want to combine dining and smoking, New York City's new smoking law provides a single loophole: go to a very small restaurant.

There are also plenty of surprises. What is familiar is the artist's signature themes: consumerism, recycled imagery from comic books and 1960's advertising and a penchant for ironic quotations from other artworks. What is surprising is how profoundly the graphic work has fed -- and in some instances proved a catalyst to -- the artist's innovation on canvas. Most startling are Mr. Lichtenstein's pre-Pop prints from the early 1950's, which provide an unusual look at some of his earliest artistic sources. Here, quirky images of knights in armor, damsels in distress and tomahawk-wielding Indians look to Paul Klee and Picasso as their inspiration, rather than to contemporary culture. Here, too, the reader sees foreshadowings of the artist's later visual language: the Ben Day dots, artificial wood grain, parallel stripes and black outlines of his hallmark Pop pieces. The prints, which Mary Lee Corlett, a research associate at the National Gallery of Art, has arranged in chronological order, are divided into three sections: prints made by the artist, prints made in conjunction with events at the Leo Castelli Gallery and prints and related objects that were mass produced. Ruth E. Fine, the National Gallery's curator of modern prints and drawings, has provided a plodding, though fact-filled, essay examining the symbiosis between Mr. Lichtenstein's graphic works and his paintings, as well as the artist's seminal role in the print renaissance of the 1960's. This is an eye-opening book, unusual for the light it sheds on aspects of Roy Lichtenstein's career that were previously unexamined.

It's an empowerment thing.\"   The nature of the humor is clear from the opening theme song, in which the word \"animaniacs\" is rhymed with, among other things, \"the President plays the sax,\" \"pay-for-play contracts\" and \"baloney in our slacks.\" Zany is rhymed with \"Citizen Kane-y.\"   Yakko, Wakko and Dot, who apparently were locked away in the water tower on the Warner's Burbank lot many years ago because of misbehavior, escape periodically to have adventures that are a combination of visual gags so old they reek of homage (that's just what they are, says Ms. MacCurdy) and wordplay.   IN ONE EPISODE, SET IN A CANDY store, the owner asks the trio what they'd like. \"Well, world peace would be nice,\" one answers. \"And a Chevrolet in every driveway.\" In terms of candy, they insist on the jelly beans on the highest shelf (this is one of those candy stores with 30-foot ceilings). After the owner climbs a very tall ladder to get the candy and bring it down, the kids (there is some debate about what kind of animals the Warners are) change their mind. And there is an invasion by a band of five nuns wielding rulers.   Sometimes the humor is all verbal, and somewhat insiderish. Yakko: \"It's that time again.\" Dot: \"To make fun of the Disney Channel?\" Yakko: \"If you can't say something nice, you're probably at the Ice Capades.\"   The Brain, of Pinky and the Brain, is stopped by a police officer and unable to produce a driver's license or registration papers for the mini-van he stole from the lab. So he admits his world-conquest plans but promises to include \"new funding for law enforcement\" when he controls the universe. The cop lets him go.   Skippy Squirrel, another character with his own segments, always wants his Aunt Slappy, who says things like \"Oh, for the love of Al Gore\" and \"All right already, Mr. Story Editor,\" to read him a bedtime story. When she takes Skippy to see the classic movie \"Bumbie, the Dearest Deer,\" he is so upset by the death of Bumbie's mother that Aunt Slappy takes him to visit the actress who played her. The actress is quite old now, lives in a trailer park and brags about having dated George Jetson in her youth.   And there is Mindy, the baby girl who insists on calling her mother Lady, and Mindy's dog, Buttons. Mom leaves the two alone, entering the house with the line \"Now to call Mary Beth and gloat about my new apron.\"   Music is an important part of the mix. There have been parodies of the \"Gilligan's Island\" theme song, a song about the unimportance of humans in the big universe (\"We're tiny little specks about the size of Mickey Rooney,\" which is rhymed with puny) and the series' claim to educational value, Yakko's operettalike recitation of the name of every nation on the globe. As Rita the cat singing about her move by boxcar to Monterey, Calif., says: \"Hey, it's a cartoon. What'd you expect? Sondheim?\"   Tom Ruegger, the show's senior producer, swears that \"Animaniacs\" was born one day when he drove onto the Warner lot and looked up at the water tower. \"We needed a marquee name,\" he recalls. \"So we thought, what if we made the Warner Brothers into cartoon characters?\" Yakko, Wakko and Dot's personalities, he says, are based on \"real kids, with that creating-havoc-in-the-back-of-the-car energy.\" Mr. Ruegger's own children were 8, 6 and 4 at the time.   About 25 sets of characters were presented to Mr. Spielberg for approval. He seemed to really like four or five; he killed several on the spot. \"Some family members of his dropped by,\" says Mr. Ruegger. \"Mindy and Buttons survived the cut that day because one of his kids pointed to Mindy and said, 'Yes. Mindy is good.' \"   Characters that never saw the light of day include Nipsy and Russell (either two possums or two raccoons), Bossy Beaver and Doyle (\"sort of the Ed Asner of beavers and his moronic sidekick\") and the amoeba stars of \"As the Petri Dish Turns.\"   No one, it seems, objected to \"Animaniacs\" carrying on the tradition of cartoon violence. Characters get blown up by Fourth of July fireworks and by chemistry sets, squashed by various vehicles and hit over the head by objects five times their size.  As Ms. MacCurdy says, \"Warner Brothers cartoons from the beginning have been based on classic comedy -- Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy -- and the physical nature of that.\"   Mark Madrilejo, a 22-year-old computer engineering major at the University of Michigan, couldn't agree more.    \"There are plenty of anvils being dropped,\" says Mr. Madrilejo, an unabashed fan of the show. \"But there's an understanding that all the horrendous things that happen to some of the characters is all make-believe. No one dies. They just experience a moment of perhaps excruciating pain.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Establishing Folk Art's Pedigree","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/nyregion/art-establishing-folk-art-s-pedigree.html","abstract":"  THOUGH \"A World of Their Own\" may seem like a departure for the Newark Museum, it is actually a kind of reprise, for the institution was the first of its kind to show folk art, in 1930.

They were sharecroppers and domestics and other put-upon products of Southern segregation who rebelled in their own iron way, heading north on trains and buses in what came to be known as the Great Migration.   They fled to Harlem and Detroit and Chicago and elsewhere for work and the vote -- and to see what freedom tasted like. Soon the strong backs that had picked cotton and tobacco for the South were instead butchering hogs and bending steel for the North. Their cheap labor helped feed a postwar boom. They had children, and their children had children, but when the rules of manufacturing changed, the jobs went away. For many, the promised land seemed not to live up to its promise anymore, and drugs and violence took hold as the opportunities that had brought the people there vanished.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950212","headline":"Connecticut Premiere For Piano Concerto","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/nyregion/connecticut-premiere-for-piano-concerto.html","abstract":"  WHO'S supposed to play this?\" asked the pianist Michael Boriskin, in mock hysteria.

Under the 6-to-2 ruling, frequent fliers who think the airlines have not lived up to their promises can go to state courts and sue for breach of contract.   The decision permits a lawsuit filed against American Airlines on behalf of four million members of its AAdvantage program to go forward in Illinois. The plaintiffs claim that American, which created the first frequent flier program, breached its contract with members in 1988 when it announced that the free tickets earned with frequent flier miles could not be used on certain dates and flights. The new rules -- blackout dates and capacity controls -- reduced the value of miles already accumulated.   American says that it has added many benefits to its frequent flier program and that AAdvantage members have always been on notice that it could change the terms of the program at any time. Still to be established at trial is whether the airline reserved the right to impose the changes retroactively -- a practice familiar to a number of passengers, who are discovering that the 20,000 miles that once earned a free round-trip domestic coach ticket now fall 5,000 miles short.   The Supreme Court's decision is no guarantee of victory to the plaintiffs. Another part of the lawsuit, which claims that American violated the Illinois consumer fraud statute, is barred by Federal law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in the majority opinion.   And there is some ambiguity about what effect a courtroom victory would have. Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, said the case could lead airlines to become less creative and more cautious with their frequent flier plans. \"I'm not sure if there will be any winners in this case,\" he said.

The Penguins moved closer to the N.H.L. record 15 games without a loss at the start of a season, set by the Edmonton Oilers in 1984-85. Pittsburgh's Ken Wregget, the only N.H.L. goaltender to play every minute this season, has allowed 3 goals or fewer in 9 of the 11 games. The unbeaten streak is his career best and he has notched 10 victories for the ninth consecutive season. The Penguins' only non-victory was last Sunday's 3-3 tie at New Jersey.

Beaten by an American, Allen Johnson, Thursday at Madrid for his first loss in 45 races, Jackson, a Welshman who is world champion and world record-holder over 110 meters outdoors, was quickest off the blocks and beat Tony Jarrett of Wales, the world championship silver medalist. Meanwhile, the world and Olympic 100-meter champion Linford Christie of Britain clocked the second-fastest 60-meter time this year, 6.56.

The couple had been married less than a year. Theirs was clearly a rare, fundamentalist version of an Islamic marriage, not typical of Islam as a whole. Some in the wedding party said they were shocked that the marriage ceremony made reference to the husband's right to beat his wife.
