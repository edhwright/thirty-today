As part of the assault on welfare, House Republicans want to overhaul federally funded foster care and adoption services. They would consolidate many existing programs into block grants and chop funding by nearly $3 billion. For a system that is already overburdened and underfunded, these proposals could spell disaster.    The child welfare system is a patchwork of programs, usually run by states and counties, that protect abused and neglected children and offer services to troubled families where children are at risk. It also helps families who take responsibility for neglected and abandoned children through foster care or adoption. The system has grown as families and neighborhoods, devastated by the economy, drugs and alcohol, have disintegrated. In 1993, almost three million children were reportedly abused or neglected, an increase of 130 percent from a decade earlier.

Mr. Packwood said the committee's members reached a consensus supporting huge budget cuts during a weekend retreat on the Chesapeake Bay that also was attended by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. Most at the meeting also opposed further cuts in taxes until the deficit was under control. That position puts the panel, most of whose members are middle-of-the-road politically, at odds with more conservative Republicans in the Senate and especially the House, where Speaker Newt Gingrich has endorsed a five-year package of business and personal tax cuts totaling $189 billion.   LINE-ITEM VETO: In an effort to unify members of their party, Senate Republicans unveiled a proposal to reduce the Federal budget deficit by allowing the President to veto any of the thousands of separate items in Federal spending bills. The proposal would also allow the President to veto parts of a tax bill that grant favorable treatment to a particular taxpayer or to a \"limited group of taxpayers.\" Senate Democrats called the proposal a gimmick and a dodge, forcing the President to propose what Congress cannot bring itself to do: cut pork-barrel projects out of spending bills.

Mississippi State has all the necessary toys, too -- a 6-foot-11-inch center with fly swatters for arms; a guard with a shooting range of 30 feet, and a coach with imagination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950321","headline":"It's the Nightmare Team: U.S. Loses Another Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/21/sports/pan-american-games-it-s-the-nightmare-team-us-loses-another-game.html","abstract":"  Lost in the clamor of Michael Jordan's return, ignored amid the office-pool obsession with the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, is another sign that any advantage the United States has over the world in basketball is winding down like a 24-second clock.

Pataki, spearheaded the passage of landmark legislation that was intended to revolutionize care for the mentally ill and reduce the number of sick, disoriented people living on the streets. Now, just as the first dollars have started to flow to local treatment programs, Governor Pataki has proposed repealing vital parts of the law and making large cuts in the very community programs that he and his fellow Republican senators had pressed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to enact. A1. FIREFIGHTERS OPPOSE NEW MEDICAL ROLE   The push to get New York City's firefighters ready to respond to medical emergencies has not gone smoothly. It has not only angered and exasperated the firefighters but left Emergency Medical Service workers uncertain of their futures. There have been charges and counter-charges, widespread grumbling and some open revolt, as well as strongly worded directives from the Fire Department's top officials that \"there is no turning back.\" A1.

B5. TWICE-CONVICTED KILLER IS EXECUTED   In the end, the execution of Thomas J. Grasso, inmate No. 209207, was almost anticlimactic. The twice-convicted killer died quietly in an Oklahoma prison at 12:22 A.M. After his death, prison officials distributed copies of a hand-scrawled \"last statement\" paying a kind of tribute to former Gov. Mario M.

It is impossible to excuse the agency's -- and the manufacturer's -- failure to detect and correct the problem much earlier.   It no doubt comes as a shock to most travelers to find that the F.A.A. requires manufacturers to design planes to fly through tiny water droplets in clouds, but not through the larger droplets of freezing drizzle or freezing rain. The rationale is that experience indicated that freezing rain was not a serious hazard. Big jets flying above the weather do not encounter the larger droplets. At lower altitudes, conditions that create such droplets can be forecast, and pilots warned to avoid them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Building A Ballet Of Bodies And Space","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/arts/dance-review-building-a-ballet-of-bodies-and-space.html","abstract":"  \"Ogive,\" Eliot Feld's fourth new ballet for his company's current season, shares the nostalgic perfume that wafts through his other recent works to French music.

The Taiwanese film, which has screenings this evening at 6 and on Saturday at 9 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the New Directors/New Films series, has a wonderfully evocative central conceit. Mei-mei (Yang Kuei-mei), a chic young real estate agent, misplaces the keys to a vacant duplex apartment in a spanking new high-rise. Hsiao-kang (Lee Kang-sheng), a shy young man who is later revealed to be gay, finds the keys and begins living there surreptitiously. When Mei-mei is not tidying up the apartment and communicating by cellular phone with her employer, she, too, uses the place, for trysts with Ah-jung (Chen Chao-jung), a man she picks up in a luncheonette for casual sex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/nyregion/c-corrections-926795.html","abstract":"  An article on Sunday about a new course on murder that has become the most popular ever at Amherst College misspelled the college president's surname.

People looked at him, they saw someone else. Here he was, doing Arnold Palmer's whirlybird, out-of-balance finish. There he was, a pile of golf balls bulging from the front of his shirt, doing Craig Stadler.   When they heard him, it was always someone else as well. Seve Ballesteros or Chi Chi Rodriguez. The lead singer of the rock band Jake Trout and the Flounders was another of his impersonations. He could do everybody.   This year, Peter Jacobsen has added another golfer to his repertory. It is by far his best impression yet. It is of a 40-year-old reborn player, a pretty long hitter and great iron player who has become a short- game wizard, a personable guy who interacts with the galleries, laughs at bad breaks and acts the same way whether he's shooting 75 or 65.   Peter Jacobsen is doing . . . Peter Jacobsen. And what an act it is. A man who had won four tournaments in his career has already won half that many this year. And he has a tie for second and a third-place finish as well. He has won more money in three months ($690,351) than he did in any of his previous 18 individual seasons. Always a good player, Jacobsen is now borderline great.   Put it this way: the $3 million Players Championship gets under way Thursday at the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass with a luminous array of golfing talent -- a field that includes the top 36 ranked players in the world -- and Jacobsen has to be considered one of the favorites. He no longer has to do Nick Price or Greg Norman or Nick Faldo or Ernie Els. He now has the game to think about beating them.   Jacobsen is the leading money- winner on tour, the leading all- round player, No. 1 in four statistical categories and certainly among the favorites. And he is exactly the same person in every way but one. For the first time in his career, he has developed a short game. For someone whose touch was always impeccable when it came to the nuances of an impression -- he would always have the telling little raise of the eyebrow or the habitual movement down cold -- he had no real touch around the greens. Last year he finally broke down and visited the short-game guru Dave Pelz in Boca Raton, Fla.   \"I think we're all a little hard-headed,\" Jacobsen said. \"We don't realize our shortcomings, our weaknesses. I realized after all these years of playing golf and looking at all my stats that my putting and chipping were always somewhere near the back.\"   This is the concrete answer. All the intangibles like confidence, self-assurance, rededication, they all come from an ability to get the ball in the hole. And that is something Jacobsen is doing better now than at any time in his life. A quick analysis of his statistics today versus last year at this time is revealing: he has added 10 yards of distance to his drives, averaging 269.7 this year; he is ranked first in greens in regulation compared with 53d; he is using his length and his touch to birdie more par 5's, ranking third in that department compared with 65th last year.   \"Peter is getting closer and closer,\" Pelz said. \"For years he had been focusing on mechanics in the short game. Now he is focusing his mind's eye on speed and touch. I'll tell you, if you put Tom Kite's short game on Peter Jacobsen, you'd have the best player in the world.\"   What you have right now is one of the best-liked players in the world. Jacobsen was always amiable enough, and that has broadened and developed into a comedic on-course demeanor that reaches out and embraces galleries. It stems from something his father told him just before he died in 1992, when Peter asked him what was the most important thing about golf, the setup or the grip or tempo.   \"He looked at me and said, 'Peter, it's a sense of humor,' \" Jacobsen said.   That is one thing that always came naturally to Jacobsen. Now, with the work on the one thing that didn't, he has become a complete player. CHIP SHOTS    The heads of five of the world's leading professional golf organizations met here Wednesday to discuss existing international competitions and to map out plans for something that could eventually resemble a world tour. . . . . ARNOLD PALMER was named as the captain of the United States team for the 1996 Presidents Cup. DAVID GRAHAM will again be the captain of the International team.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Japanese Police Find Chemicals And Gas Masks at Sect's Offices","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/world/terror-tokyo-overview-japanese-police-find-chemicals-gas-masks-sect-s-offices.html","abstract":"  A police search of a religious sect's training compound on Wednesday turned up about two tons of chemicals, including some similar to those used in the nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, the police said today.

The title character (Nina Petri) is a woman who has been under a man's thumb for as long as she can remember. Brought up by her repressive father in the dreary apartment he owns, she has been his sole caretaker since he was crippled in a terrible accident.
