He is the musical charmer who seduces Death into taking a holiday, if only a short one.

Myths like this live partly because they are malleable. So when Craig Lucas (words) and Gerald Busby (music) deposit the Orpheus myth in the midst of music students at an American community college, minor adjustments make it fit. Tinkering with the ending of this story is an old operatic tradition anyway. The one for \"Orpheus in Love,\" which opened last night at the Circle Repertory Company, falls between happy and unhappy.

James Tobin  Nobel laureate and emeritus professor of economics, Yale University    Is there a case for  [ fiscal ]  stimulus to create the jobs we need by 1996? I think there is.    The labor market is weaker than the unemployment rate suggests, for several reasons. Many workers are involuntarily working short time when they would like to be working full time. As everybody knows, we're experiencing an unusual series of layoffs by businesses, permanent layoffs, not temporary cyclical layoffs.    Why can't the Federal Reserve do this job by itself? Well, we heard about the bank credit crunch yesterday and we see that the Fed has more or less given up on doing anything more to stimulate demand, even though it has 300 basis points left between interest rates, short-term interest rates now and zero. I think maybe the Fed did things so late and so little during the recent downturns that they let the economy and business expectations slip away from their grasp.    That's why I think the country needs some fiscal stimulus in the short run. I would be willing to see something like 1 percent of G.D.P. stimulus, which would be about $60 billion a year, and for a couple of years. Other people may prefer a smaller amount.    Now fiscal policy for recovery is bound to raise the deficit temporarily. And we're fooling ourselves if we think there's a way of having a fiscal stimulus that doesn't have that result.    The thing to do, I believe, is to combine the short-run fiscal stimulus with credible deficit reduction policies that will be phased in at a later time, so far as possible enacted, so that they will come into effect at a later time, whether they're tax increases or expenditure reductions.    In today's weak economy, fiscal austerity would be counterproductive and would actually reduce investment in plant and equipment, in technology and human capital for the future. So it actually would damage the prospects of our children and grandchildren, rather than improving them.  Allen Sinai  Chief economist, Boston Company    Short run, a modest dose of net fiscal stimulus probably is necessary to lift growth and jobs as part of the task of raising potential growth in the long run, as well as to sustain a fledgling business expansion. A $20 billion to $30 billion program of short-run fiscal stimulus I believe should be ready to go, legislated as needed in early 1993.    The measures used in this fiscal stimulus I think should . . . do double duty in the sense of being measures that lift short-run growth in jobs but also raise long-run potential output. Candidates . . . include infrastructure spending on roads, highways, buildings, airports, rail and telecommunications and equipment investment tax credits.   Investment tax credits would produce the greatest bang for a buck if they were targeted towards productive equipment, incremental and refundable. Other possibilities: measures such as inflation indexing of capital gains, R.& D. tax credits, education and manpower training programs and incentives for small business.    A major effort should be made to find measures that can raise growth without raising the Federal budget deficit. Some possibilities include an easier bank regulatory environment for bank lending to improve growth at little cost to the budget, a shift in the composition of Treasury financing further away from long-term issues to reduce interest costs of Federal Government financing and greater efficiencies and reduced costs for the provision and delivery of health care services.   On timing, you should do it right away and  [ make it ]  retroactive . . . to early December. I think the impact would be in the second through the fourth quarter of next year when the current impulse of the economy may indeed be fading and so it would come at the right time. If you wait longer, it's dangerous.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Mr. Gaidar Departs, Democratically","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/opinion/mr-gaidar-departs-democratically.html","abstract":"  It's tempting to interpret the resignation of Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar of Russia as a startling rebuke to Boris Yeltsin and his program of radical economic reform. Yet even with the more- cautious apparatchik Viktor Chernomyrdin in the job, reform could still go forward, though at a slower pace and on a different trajectory. And though the infighting was brutal, the result was reached democratically.   That reaffirms the wisdom of not imposing a made-in-America brand of economic policy as the test for all United States aid to Russia. America's basic interest lies in consolidating democracy's tenuous hold on this vast and troubled country and preventing a fateful turn to ultra-nationalist demagoguery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Expectation and Intricacy Conspire Against Nagle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/sports/pro-football-expectation-and-intricacy-conspire-against-nagle.html","abstract":"  He has been at it for 11 months -- morning, afternoon and often nights -- and Browning Nagle still can't complete even half his passes and has thrown 14 interceptions to only 6 touchdowns.

Only the most obviously disreputable of American imports and revivals fail to earn critical raves here, and on occasion local versions of New York shows are proclaimed superior to the originals. During the 1980's, this was most famously the case with Richard Eyre's staging of \"Guys and Dolls\" and Cameron Mackintosh's upbeat revision of Stephen Sondheim's \"Follies,\" though American visitors could see that both productions were far from fluent in Broadwayese. In \"Guys and Dolls,\" Damon Runyon's mugs sometimes spoke with Southern accents and tapped like Bojangles.   So it was with skepticism that I approached the new production of the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein \"Carousel,\" which opened last weekend to ecstatic reviews and turn-away crowds at the Royal National Theater, the site of the Eyre \"Guys and Dolls.\" But for once the wild enthusiasm may be an understatement. This is without question the most revelatory, not to mention the most moving, revival I've seen of any Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. The National has recently found startling new ways of looking at the dramas of Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller under both Peter Hall's and Mr. Eyre's leadership, and now it proves just as imaginative in sweeping away decades of cliches from an American musical classic of the same period.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19921217","headline":"Fischer Said to Plan a 2d Match in Yugoslavia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/17/world/fischer-said-to-plan-a-2d-match-in-yugoslavia.html","abstract":"  A day after he was indicted in Washington for violating international economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, Bobby Fischer, the former world chess champion, was reported by a Belgrade newspaper today to be planning another match in Yugoslavia in March.

Jagr's Overtime Goal Wins It for Penguins  Jaromir Jagr scored with 2 minutes 10 seconds remaining in overtime to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins over the host Philadelphia Flyers, 5-4, last night. Jagr picked up a deflected pass from Mario Lemieux in the right circle and beat Philadelphia goaltender Tommy Soderstrom, who was making his National Hockey League debut. The winning goal was Jagr's league-leading seventh of the season. He has 14 goals over all. Pittsburgh has won five of its last six and is unbeaten in its last 11 against the Flyers (8-0-3). Philadelphia's sixth straight loss tied the club record set in 1970. Kevin Dineen had given Philadelphia a 4-4 tie at 5:10 of the third period when he skated in front of the Pittsburgh net and lifted a backhander that beat Tom Barrasso. The goal also snapped an 11-game scoreless drought for Dineen. (AP) Canadiens 8, Nordiques 3: Montreal scored six first-period goals in Quebec and went on to avenge a loss to its provincial rival a night earlier. The Canadiens, who lost by 5-1 to Quebec at Montreal on Wednesday, retained first place in the Adams Division, 4 points ahead of the second-place Nordiques. In the wild first period, the teams combined for 9 goals on 18 shots: Montreal took a 4-0 lead, Quebec rallied to make the score 4-3, and the Canadiens added two more goals to lead by 6-3. Montreal stopped Quebec's five-game unbeaten streak and also earned its first victory over the Nordiques in five regular-season games since last Dec. 26. (AP) Blackhawks 5, Jets, 1: Ed Belfour ran his unbeaten streak to seven games as Chicago remained unbeaten for the 11th straight time at home by beating Winnipeg. Belfour stopped 29 shots to extend his streak to 6-0-1. The Blackhawks' penalty-killers shut down the Jets on all 10 of their power plays. Jeremy Roenick scored two goals to lead the Blackhawks, who are 9-0-2 in their last 11 at home and have won five straight over all.

His 1991 film, \"Scream of Stone,\" begins with the hilarious absurdity of indoor mountain-climbing as a televised sport. In a studio, two world-class mountaineers literally climb the walls, with Donald Sutherland giving the play-by-play. Soon a middle-aged champion and his arrogant young challenger agree to race to the top of a killer mountain in Patagonia. Brad Dourif, as the most space-shot climber of all, pops in and insists he has already been there. \"I dedicated my climb to Mae West,\" he says. \"They say she's dead, but she's not. She owns a beauty parlor.\" He gets the last word with the film's funny final turn.   Although it has dull patches and laughable moments of seriousness, this new film is a link to the dazzling old Herzog, who seemed to have disappeared. It offers spectacular photography of the treacherous, icy climb and characters who are as gloriously demented as the heroes of \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" or \"Fitzcarraldo\" (the forays into the South American jungle that brought the director his widest acclaim).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"On My Mind; Toys or Torture","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/opinion/on-my-mind-toys-or-torture.html","abstract":"  At the end, President Bush had one fine political opportunity left.

We ought to look at another solution: let all charities engage in limited political activity.

They are absolutely prohibited, however, from advocating the election or defeat of candidates. This means charities cannot endorse candidates, donate money to them or engage in overtly partisan activities. Nonpartisan voter education and get-out-the-vote activities are permitted if in compliance with strict guidelines.

The 16-nation body did not indicate how it would help enforce the ban, but Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that NATO was preparing contingency plans to enforce the no-flights zone and that the United States was prepared to provide aircraft in such an operation.   Options ranged from overflights to what Mr. Eagleburger called \"more muscular measures.\" He acknowledged that if the ban is enforced, it could put United Nations troops at risk of retaliation and that it was a \"possibility\" that they might be forced to withdraw, at least temporarily.  Warning to U.N.    The NATO decision came as the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, warned that United Nations troops in Bosnia may be attacked if Western nations attempt to enforce the ban on flights.   The Serbs are reported to have violated the ban on flights 225 times since it was imposed in October. But there is no proof that they have resumed combat missions.   NATO has already contributed personnel and equipment to the United Nations peackeeping operation in the Balkans, and its ships are in the Adriatic, helping to enforce a blockade. NATO reconnaissance aircraft are providing data on violations of the flight ban.   On another issue, Mr. Eagleburger warned Ukraine that its relationship with the United States will suffer if it continues to delay ratification of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the strategic arms reduction treaty slashing the arsenals of nuclear weapons in the United States and the former Soviet republics. The Ukrainian Foreign Minsiter, Anatoly Zlenko, told Mr. Eagleburger earlier in the week that the Kiev Parliament would not take up the issue until January at the earliest.   Mr. Eagleburger said he made clear during the meeting that the United States \"is not particularly happy with the delays,\" adding that he expected \"ratification and without reservations,\" and if progress is delayed much longer it will \"inevitably have an impact\" on the two countries' relations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Council Backs New Board To Review Police Conduct","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/nyregion/council-backs-new-board-to-review-police-conduct.html","abstract":"  The City Council voted overwhelmingly last night to establish an all-civilian agency to investigate police misconduct, ending for now a racially charged debate that has polarized the city several times since the idea was first proposed in the 1960's.

Should a theatergoer become restless with Mr. Gordon's attempted shenanigans, there is the scenery to brighten the journey. Mr. Grooms's contribution begins with the drop curtain, a flamboyant rebus-like interpretation of the title of the show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"Parole Board Denies Release Of Chambers for 2 More Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/nyregion/parole-board-denies-release-of-chambers-for-2-more-years.html","abstract":"  Robert E.

The dance is a departure for the Ailey company. And it was the first time a work by Ms. Zollar, a choreographer with a style and passion all her own, had been presented by a major dance company outside her own Urban Bush Women troupe.    It would be impossible to match the Bush Women's honed intensity. The six Ailey women bring out the dance values in \"Shelter\" to a greater degree than Ms. Zollar's dancers tend to, thereby revealing her complex, seamless weave of dance, words and music. No untrained dancer could perform \"Shelter\" credibly. And yet these are taut, angled bodies that communicate something a good deal less rarefied than even the most accessible and popular pieces in the Ailey company's repertory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921218","headline":"THE TRANSITION: Clinton Selects Ex-Mayor for H.U.D. and an Ex-Marine for Veterans Affairs; Cisneros Achieves Career Comeback With Nomination","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/us/transition-clinton-selects-ex-mayor-for-hud-ex-marine-for-veterans-affairs.html","abstract":"  In the spring of 1989, as he prepared to leave the San Antonio mayor's office still bruised by disclosures of an extra-marital affair, Henry G.
