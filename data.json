In 1955, the Bums finally avenged five defeats at the hands of their rivals from the Bronx. Stewart Wolpin's BUMS NO MORE! The Championship Season of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers (Harkavy/St. Martin's, $25) is an affectionate salute to that season of redemption. Pitch-by-pitch accounts of the seven games and dramatic photographs of key plays are the next best thing to a box seat in Ebbets Field or Yankee Stadium. As Mr. Wolpin, a former sportswriter at The Newark Star-Ledger, recounts, the Yankee dominance was such that even oddsmakers in Brooklyn bet against the Dodgers. When the Yankees won the first two games, it looked as if the bookies were right. But the Dodgers won the next three, and after another Yankees victory, ended a 55-year championship drought behind the fielding of Sandy Amoros and the pitching of Johnny Podres. Some of baseball's brightest legends feature in Mr. Wolpin's account, from Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider to Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Whitey Ford. But he also vividly evokes life in Brooklyn in the mid-1950's and the euphoria that gripped the borough when next year finally arrived. \nHANNA RUBIN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"Seles Is a Surprise Guest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/sports/sports-people-tennis-seles-is-a-surprise-guest.html","abstract":"  MONICA SELES, out of tennis since being stabbed during a match in April 1993, made a surprise appearance yesterday for the dedication of a $3 million indoor tennis center at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.

A year ago, four teams of architects, designers and engineers were invited by a BBC-sponsored television producer to come up with ideas for remodeling a decommissioned nuclear power plant in northern Wales, to be featured on a documentary series. For one of the firms, the New York design group Site, the invitation launched an epic voyage through time and space that led from Stone Age Britain to the end of the world. It also led the group into the moral quandary that often confronts architects who try to take an active role in addressing social issues.   Trawsfynydd (pronounced Traus-VEN-ith) Nuclear Power Station is a landmark of the atomic age. When completed in 1959, the plant's stark design, by the distinguished architect Sir Basil Spence, was regarded as a suitably awesome symbol of technological power. Today, after decades of increasing public awareness of ecological issues, a visitor is more likely to see the 20-story plant as a monstrous intruder in an Arcadian setting. But in the postwar years many were eager to regard the plant and its lush green surroundings as a natural fit. Nuclear power, so the reasoning went, tapped into the innermost mysteries of nature. Why couldn't it coexist harmoniously with forests and lakes?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"ART;\nJacob Lawrence Applies His Geometry to John Brown's Story","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/art-jacob-lawrence-applies-his-geometry-to-john-browns-story.html","abstract":"THESE are triumphant times for Jacob Lawrence.

Commissioner William J. Bratton and three of his predecessors, Patrick V. Murphy, Benjamin Ward and Richard J. Condon, spoke at New York Law School on Friday about how best to fight the perennial problem. They discussed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's battle with the City Council over having an independent monitor oversee the force, what kind of monitor is most effective, how its members should be chosen and whether it should have subpoena powers. The discussion, part of a daylong seminar, drew on experience dating to the days of the Knapp Commission and before. GEORGE JAMES Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who wants to make commanders at the precinct level more accountable by giving them more power to fight corruption.   \"When you ask the Mayor to be totally responsible, you either have to have this very naive Mayor that we have today, if he is, or someone that just thinks he can conquer all and is willing to take on the kind of pressure that will come to him if his commission fails to control corruption. Because what is he going to investigate? What is Nick Scoppetta  [ the head of the Mayor's oversight committee ]  and his committee going to be looking at?    They're going to be looking at Bill Bratton and  [ Internal Affairs Chief Patrick ]  Kelleher's attempts to control and suppress corruption. When they find it, who's going to be sitting in the driver's seat, when they find it? His police commissioner, Bratton. How did it start? How long was it going on before Bratton learned about it? Where did he learn about it? Did he find out about it from some Suffolk County policeman who stumbled accidentially on some city cop engaged in corruption, and so when the arrest comes down, it makes the New York City Police Department look inept and in competent because they didn't find it themselves and it was found in East Cupcake and not in the big city?    And is the Mayor going to be up there in the Blue Room saying, \"I picked Bratton,\" as Koch said the other day when he criticized Giuliani, said, 'You want praise? Stand next to Ben Ward and say, 'I picked Ben Ward.' Well, is he going to stand next to Bratton and say, 'I picked Bratton and this is what happened?' Because Bratton can't control all the corruption that occurs in the city.\"  Patrick V. Murphy, commissioner from 1970 to 1973, who replaced 90 percent of the top officers in the department and incorporated many Knapp Commission recommendations, including creating a central internal affairs division.   \"Rather than looking at the culture of the police department, look at the culture of the executive corps . . . . They are critical, and they can make things happen. I am convinced they can prevent corruption if the comissioner holds them accountable and they have the means.\" Richard J. Condon, commissioner from 1989 to 1990, who approves of an outside monitor, be it a special prosecutor like the one appointed following the Knapp Commission, or a strong external investigative body, as was recommended by the Mollen Commission.   \"If you have someone whose sole focus is on corruption, you should be more successful in ferreting out that corruption. And I think however the Mayor and the Council resolve the independent commission, however it turns out, I think that it will be very helpful for the Police Department.\"  Commissioner William J. Bratton, who wants to make commanders at the precinct level more accountable by giving them more power to fight corruption.   \"Information is also now in the process of being shared extensively with the precinct commanders. Why? to get them into the game. To include them. To empower them. To get them into the game. This is being done at great risk, because it's common wisdom -- traditional wisdom relating to internal affairs corruption issues is the fewer people in the know the better, because you might lose a case.   Well, that exclusion type of activity certainly doesn't seem to have worked in the sense that we have in 20-year cycles, whether we had a three-oh type of precinct situation or other precincts like the three-oh . . . .   And I think the time has come to try something different. I think it's radically different, something that is risky. I believe it's worked in dealing with crime. I believe it will work in dealing with the issue of corruption. Time will tell. Will I lose a few cases because somebody has a loose lip? Possibly. But will I win a lot more?    Will you as citizens in New York win a lot more? I think so. What will you win? By having those precinct commanders coming into the game, by giving them authority to deal with this, we can begin to deal with the new insidious type of corruption.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"ON THE TOWNS: MUSIC;\nMelancholy Tribute To a Missing Guest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/on-the-towns-music-melancholy-tribute-to-a-missing-guest.html","abstract":"SYMPHONY concerts call for high-road cultural reporting; disaster is hard news.

More often I am stopped by its splendor: the panoply of pink, cream and light green Baroque facades, punctuated at each end by stone Romanesque watchtowers, and crowned in the middle by the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral, its twisted 14th-century spires soaring to the sky. Perched atop a steep hill that rises from the Vltava River, seemingly impervious to the hordes of tourists gawking from the Charles Bridge below, the fortress was the first of my many encounters with the Czech Republic's regal past, and I did not have to go far to find more.\n\nAfter renting a somewhat rickety Skoda, the Czech-made auto, for $40 for two days, my friend and I drove south from the city last spring and, within 25 minutes, puttered into the lush Berounka River Valley, where Karlstejn Castle loomed on the horizon.

The city government, under the leadership of Mayor Vincent Suozzi, opted instead to build a co-disposal plant at a cost of about $40 million. In the co-disposal design, the incinerator burns the residue from the sewage-treatment system, supplying electricity in the process. If the incinerator does not operate, the sewage-treatment plant still remains. The City of Glen Cove must then pay for power and for the disposal of sludge, at an additional cost estimated at over $1 million a year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"A Campus Service Is Also Helping Men Get Home Safely","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/education/blackboard-a-campus-service-is-also-helping-men-get-home-safely.html","abstract":"  After 14 years of helping female students get home without trouble, the Indiana University Student Association Safety Escort Program is now ferrying men, too.

King, the black motorist beaten by white officers, and Mr. Williams's more measured -- and what some see as belated -- defense of the department's handling of evidence in the O. J. Simpson murder case.   The larger-than-life Mr. Gates, Chief of Police for 14 years, was an intense, hands-on leader, an implacable foe of crime. He was also unpredictable and abrasive, his style ultimately deemed out of synch with a highly diverse city where police work is often equal parts criminology and sociology.   He was forced from his job by the beating of Mr. King and his department's ineffective response to rioting that erupted when four officers charged in that beating were acquitted in state court.    Mr. Williams, then the Police Chief in Philadelphia, was recruited as the would-be savior of the Los Angeles force. His supporters described him as compassionate, articulate and an energetic supporter of initiatives like community policing.    Once hired, the new Chief immediately vowed to end what he called the \"paramilitary mentality\" of the department.    Yet the very traits that seemed so appealing in the wake of Mr. Gates's often divisive tenure have brought the 51-year-old Mr. Williams conflict with other police brass, resentment from the rank and file, and concern among the city's business and political leaders, some of whom see the department as once again lacking direction. Now, with three years left on his contract, he is already struggling to keep his job.    Some call him aloof, distant and indifferent to gritty details whose mastery is essential to management of a large organization; others say that although he continues to enjoy broad support among community groups, he has failed to build constituencies and alliances within the police force and among elected officials.    \"There's no doubt that Willie Williams is in deep trouble with the rank and file,\" said Gary Fullerton, director of the Los Angeles Police Protection League, the leading union of the city's officers. \"He's a nice guy, but people just don't see him as a leader.  He's looked upon by the officers as being more concerned with the public than with his subordinates. And he's definitely not a detail-oriented person.\"   Stephen Yagman, a civil rights lawyer who specializes in police misconduct cases, said, \"The only positive thing about him is that he is not Daryl Gates.\" Mr. Yagman, initially a strong Williams supporter, added: \"He has no dynamism, no zest, no verve, no panache. He seems like a nice guy, but he's simply not up to the job.\"   And Mr. Gates, who was long silent about his successor's performance, has in recent weeks become one of the leading critics.    \"Morale is in terrible shape,\" Mr. Gates said in an interview. \"They are losing people left and right. It used to be that the L.A.P.D. was the department that everyone wanted to go to. Now they're leaving, and he's a principal reason.\"   In addition, there are ethical questions.   Last month the Police Commission, the civilian body that oversees the department, undertook an investigation into reports that Mr. Williams and his family had used for private purposes cars, drivers and cellular phones paid for by the public and that he had improperly solicited perquisites that included free rooms at casino hotels in Las Vegas, whose longtime popular perception as a haven for underworld investors has only added to the concern surrounding the reports.   The accusations first surfaced in December, when Stephen Downing, a retired deputy chief, citing what he called widespread rumors of misconduct by Mr. Williams, wrote a letter advising the commission that they \"should be investigated and put to bed one way or the other.\"   Chief Williams, who declined repeated requests for an interview, has said only that he did nothing wrong, and the Police Commission so far has found no wrongdoing. But its formal inquiry into what its president, Enrique Hernandez Jr., calls \"serious charges\" continues.   Many rank-and-file officers, and even some of the Chief's supporters, complain that he has compounded his problems by his choice of a lawyer to represent him in the investigation: Melanie Lomax, who was the Police Commission's acting president when she played a leading role in forcing Mr. Gates from office.   \"For the Chief to choose her as his representative was peculiar, to say the least,\" said Mr. Fullerton, the director of the Police Protection League, \"because the vast majority of officers have traditionally seen her as an enemy of the Police Department.\"    Mr. Gates called his successor's hiring of Ms. Lomax \"another bit of absolute total stupidity on his part.\"   Mr. Williams's supporters, noting that Los Angeles brought in to run its Police Department not only an outsider but a black outsider at that, describe much of the criticism as inevitable.   \"There is no way the first black Chief of Police is not going to have trouble, especially because there is a racist element that remains in the department,\" Ms. Lomax, who is black, said in an interview. \"All of Gates's loyalists are still there, and the chief command staff is still there. They will never forgive Williams for being an outsider.\"   At the Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, the largest union of the department's black officers, the president, Sgt. Leonard Ross, agreed that race was a major factor in some of the criticism.   \"Before he was ever sworn in, he was being criticized,\" Sergeant Ross said. \"He was never given an opportunity to demonstrate ability or style; the critics met him at the door. There are two reasons for this: one, because he's from the outside, and two, because he was black.\"   Sergeant Ross added that Mr. Williams's \"public support is as strong as ever.\"   Laura Chick, a white City Councilwoman, agreed that support for Mr. Williams among the general public was strong. \"He has rebuilt the public trust and confidence,\" she said, \"and is very much on his way to rebuilding a positive rapport and the kind of support that a law-enforcement agency has to have.\"    Even so, what the critics describe as poor political skills have become a liability that has cost him many potential allies in his current struggles.   For one thing, although Mayor Richard J. Riordan has voiced support for Mr. Williams's continuing to head the department, that support has been lukewarm at best, leading to speculation that the Mayor is backing him mostly to avoid a divisive search for a new Chief.    Mr. Riordan recently appeared at a rally that community leaders had called in support of the job being done by Chief Williams and to urge the Police Commission to conclude its investigation rapidly.    But one of the rally's sponsors, Henry Dotson, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Mr. Riordan's appearance had been just \"for public consumption.\" The Mayor, Mr. Dotson said, \"doesn't wholeheartedly give Chief Williams the support that he really needs.\"    Mr. Riordan declined to be interviewed.    Perhaps most disconcerting to many officers is what they perceive as the Chief's tepid response to the barrage of attacks on the police force during the Simpson trial.   Mr. Simpson's lawyers have argued not only that the police were incompetent in their handling of evidence but also that at least one of their number is a bigot who may have tampered with the crime scene and planted a bloody glove behind Mr. Simpson's house.   Mr. Williams has defended the department's performance and asserted, most forcefully at a public rally last month, that the attacks are merely the hyperbole of a Simpson legal team handsomely paid to cloud the minds of jurors. But his support for his officers has not been nearly enough -- and has come far too late -- to satisfy many of them. For months, the Chief largely refrained from discussing the police performance in the Simpson case, saying that to do so while the trial was still under way would not be proper.    Whereas Mr. Gates was often accused of blindly defending the department, right or wrong, Mr. Williams is perceived by many officers as afraid to offend his supporters, some of whom have long been critics of the police.   Not surprisingly, Mr. Gates agrees with his former subordinates.   \"Everyone knows that I would have defended those police officers,\" Mr. Gates said. As for Mr. Williams's chances of eventually winning the trust of his officers, the former Chief said: \"No matter what he says now, he has lost it. No way he can recover.\"   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950402","headline":"ART;\nShowcase for Printmaking Techniques at a New Hostos Gallery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/nyregion/art-showcase-for-printmaking-techniques-at-a-new-hostos-gallery.html","abstract":"HEMINGWAY'S phrase \"a clean, well-lighted place\" is a fine, apt description of the new art gallery at Hostos Community College, which is currently having its second exhibition. \n\nIn the old makeshift gallery, exhibitions were lively and memorable, but the sunlight flooding this cool gray-and-white space is a definite plus.

Many come with traveling cases or special soap dishes that fit the bar's specific shape. 101 MORE USES FOR THE BATH: Designer soaps are part of a larger trend toward more luxurious bath rituals, said Allan G. Mottus, an independent consultant to the cosmetics industry. The bathroom is increasingly being seen as a place to unwind from a stressful day, and homeowners are upgrading bathrooms with additions like Jacuzzis and multihead showers. Bathing or showering two or three times a day has also become more common, especially with the physically and socially active, said Lois Mander, a spokeswoman at Ralph Lauren Fragrances. These groups often bathe once in the morning, again after working out and maybe once more before going out at night. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SOAP: Specialty soaps are both simpler and more advanced than \"off the shelf\" soaps. They boast only natural fats and oils, but their formulas also include additives that their manufacturers say distinguish them from lower-priced bars. The Polo Sport soap, for example, contains luffa particles, and the Safari for Men bar has oatmeal, both to help with exfoliation. Calvin Klein's Escape for Men soaps have algae extracts for moisturizing. Glycerine soaps, like those made by Gap Scents, also act as moisturizers. HOW FAT BECOMES SOAP: The ancient Babylonians began making soap around 2800 B.C. by mixing animal and vegetable fats and oils with plant ashes. Today, commercial alkalis have replaced plant ashes, and many \"soaps\" on the drugstore shelves, like Dove, are made mostly of synthetic detergents. SIGNS OF THE TIMES: For label-conscious consumers, stylish soaps are an inexpensive way to indulge, like designer jeans in the 1970's and couture perfumes in the 80's. \"If you can't actually improve your life style, you take ordinary items and give them the aura of aristocracy,\" the sociologist Stuart Ewen said. FOR ONE SEX OR BOTH: Unlike the traditional designer soaps, whose scents have designated them for one sex or the other, the latest ones, like those from Gap Scents and Banana Republic, have gone unisex. Still, few are economical, even if all members of the household can share them. Gap, designer to the masses, prices its soap at $2.50 for 5 ounces, or 50 cents an ounce, while Calvin Klein's Eternity comes in at the high end, at $27.50 for three 3-ounce bars -- more than $3 an ounce. (A 7-ounce bar of Ivory costs around $1.) MAKING THE GRADE: Although they're proliferating, designer soaps make up only 5 to 10 percent of the $1.6 billion soap industry, said Eric Jungermann, a consultant to the soap industry. Antibacterial soaps like Dial, in comparison, make up 35 percent of all soaps sold nationwide. \"Specialty soaps may be high-quality natural soaps with a better finish,\" Mr. Jungermann said, \"but they're not more effective. A good soap is a good soap.\" At a time when flesh-eating bacteria make the cover of news magazines and the recent top-grossing movie \"Outbreak\" is about a highly contagious killer virus, perhaps it's no wonder that the latest product to flex its muscles is soap.

The inspiration for the dress actually came to her when she was designing costumes for the film, but American Express would not agree to give her the cards she needed, she said, adding, \"It was a small Australian film, and they really did not want to be involved, and I didn't really blame them.\"    Two weeks before the awards ceremony, when she realized that she needed something to wear, she appealed again to the company, which just happened to be an advertiser for the event, and they agreed to send her 300 cards.

The article points out that corrugated cardboard should not be used as a backing board to mount art work. This is also true of the mat that will be lying on top of the art.   Most conservators would recommend cotton-rag board for both the top mats and backing, since they are inherently pH neutral. However most of the treated boards, acid-free museum grade, have been buffered to resist acids from air pollution and outgassing from other framing materials. The bottom line is that the choice of materials depends on the value of the art work, the esthetics of the presentation and the budget.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950402","headline":"LEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN RECORD NUMBERS WANT CITIZENSHIP","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/us/legal-immigrants-in-record-numbers-want-citizenship.html","abstract":"  The number of legal immigrants applying to become United States citizens has nearly doubled in the last year, an increase that one immigration official described as \"an unprecedented surge\" stemming partly from recent initiatives passed in California and in Congress that would deny many benefits to noncitizens.

Since 1976, when his first album appeared, Mr. Parker has built a dedicated following with songs that lash out at hypocrisy and smugness. He arrived just before punk-rock as part of England's pub-rock movement, which valued the craftsmanship of 1960's soul, folk-rock and country music; his rage never tore apart his songs. And through most of the last two decades, he has been articulately snarling at everyone from estranged lovers to unthinking consumers.    But on Friday night, Mr. Parker had more affectionate tidings. \"People think I'm filled with hate/ They've got it wrong, that's out of date\" he sang in \"Pollinate,\" from his new album, \"12 Haunted Episodes\" (Razor and Tie). One love song proclaimed earnestly, \"You're my partner for life\"; another insisted, \"I am undoing this cruel stage that I've been going through.\" From his older material, he chose some of his more atmospheric, less combative songs, in gentler new arrangements: \"Fool's Gold\" changed from a march to a waltz. For most of the new songs, he strummed an acoustic guitar, and he didn't mind singing 'la la\" choruses; his new band, the Episodes, would rather lilt than pound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950403","headline":"1920: Luxury in the Air : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/opinion/IHT-1920-luxury-in-the-air-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW YORK - Coast-to-coast air service, furnishing a flight from New York to San Francisco in 36 hours, travelling by day in a comfortably appointed, chair- equipped cabin, and riding at night in Pullman-like berths, is to be a reality early next July, acc","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950403","headline":"Sports of the Times; Arkansas-U.C.L.A.: A Championship That Deserves the Name","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/sports/sports-of-the-times-arkansas-ucla-a-championship-that-deserves-the-name.html","abstract":"  BASICALLY, the Final Four boils down to this for me: The attraction is not the fanfare, not the idea of \"being there.\" I like championship things.

On Sunday, about 100 of their spiritual descendants ventured back in time, making a pilgrimage to the places the congregation has called home: from that first humble site at Grand and Clinton Streets, to the current Synagogue Emanu-El at Fifth Avenue and 65th Street, on the corner where the Astor Mansion once looked onto Central Park. B3. END OF THE LINE FOR THE TRANSIT POLICE   At the stroke of a new day, Robert Zink, a boyishly good-looking former high school linebacker, got a new identity.

FOR SOME FANS, PEACE TINGED WITH ANGER   In the dust and dirt of a city playground, pure baseball is played without hot dogs, heroes or joyless thoughts of Major League squabbles. After a season without a World Series, the sandlot is one of the only retreats for fans and players who confess that they feel more loyalty to a scuffed and battered baseball than to the men who throw them. Not even the talk of a baseball settlement brings peace. C2. REGION  MURDER TRIAL SET IN JORDAN   A Jordanian-American who confessed to strangling his wife in her New Jersey apartment after a fight over their two children is scheduled to go on trial in Amman, Jordan, on Monday for murder. Mohammed Ismail Abequa, 46, was arrested in Jordan, where he had fled with his daughter and son shortly after the July 4 killing. He has been in custody since then. Mr. Abequa will be tried by a three-judge, no-jury criminal court on charges of premeditated murder and kidnapping. B5. A NEW AUDIENCE FOR BASKETBALL   It was a typical gathering of basketball fanatics: tortilla chips and bean dip, a mammoth television broadcasting the game, and feverish fans whooping their devotion. But these were not baritone-voiced fans cheering on slam-dunking players. They were sisters rooting for their undefeated University of Connecticut women's basketball team -- graceful athletes who have become role models for girls across the state, capturing the hearts and minds of a normally untapped audience. B5. URBAN RENEWAL SPURRED BY DYNAMITE   They once represented the promise of urban renewal. But two buildings in the Christopher Columbus Homes in Newark have been turned to dust, a symbol of well-intentioned housing policies turned bad.

have a special weight in Elly Ameling's recital at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday night. Meaning \"lost happiness,\" they appear in Goethe's text for Schubert's \"Erster Verlust,\" or \"First Loss.\" But as they emerged in this finely wrought performance, the vowels seemed to deepen and darken, so the word \"Gluck,\" coming at the end of a phrase, seemed ripe with fulfillment, invoking a memory laden with past pleasure.   This all-Schubert recital, presented to accommodate the soprano's admirers who could not get tickets to her sold-out farewell next Sunday afternoon, was full of similarly potent musical images: a glinting, radiant articulation of the word \"Silberflimmer\" (\"silver glimmer\") in \"An den Mond\" that seemed self-describing; an almost exuberant proclamation of \"dahin\" (\"there, far off\") in \"Kennst du das Land\" that pointed toward a distant goal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950404","headline":"Purcell Unstaged, the Better to Be Heard","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/04/arts/music-review-purcell-unstaged-the-better-to-be-heard.html","abstract":"  In an ideal world like the one envisioned by Purcell at the end of \"King Arthur,\" William Christie would have been able to conduct this supple, sensuous score in the fully staged production that he led in Paris a few months ago.

As it turned out, only a concert version could be financially justified during Mr. Christie's weeklong visit to the Brooklyn Academy of Music with his group, Les Arts Florissants.   So on Friday night, the characters of King Arthur, his beloved Emmeline and his nemesis, the pagan King Oswald, were reduced to brief impersonations by two actors -- Philip Franks and Sylvestra le Touzel -- and the text itself was summarized by some cursory, comic and slightly campy commentary written by Jeremy Sams.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950404","headline":"For Conner And Koch, Sailoff Is Last Hope","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/04/sports/yacht-racing-for-conner-and-koch-sailoff-is-last-hope.html","abstract":"  The way Dennis Conner figures it, his boat, Stars & Stripes, has a 50-50 chance of beating Bill Koch's Mighty Mary in the sailoff Tuesday for a berth in the America's Cup defense finals.

That removed a big barrier to House passage of the tax bill later this week. The dissidents had held the bill hostage for two weeks, obliquely threatening to block a final vote on it unless they were guaranteed that Congress would not rush tax cuts into law and then renege on its promise to cut spending as well. The accord yesterday gave leaders assurance that their five-year, $189 billion package of tax cuts would pass an increasingly skeptical House. HEALTH INSURANCE DEDUCTION -- The Senate agreed to extend a tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed workers. The measure, contained in a House-Senate conference report, cleared the Senate by a unanimous voice vote and now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. The measure would allow an estimated 3.2 million self-employed people to deduct for tax purposes 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. MEDICARE -- The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in 2002, the Clinton Administration told Congress. The annual report said that Medicare's hospital insurance program was now \"severely out of financial balance\" and that there was an urgent need for Congress to address the problem. But it recommended no specific measures. POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALS -- Gay-rights advocates, senior military officers and even some Republicans expressed surprise at Speaker Newt Gingrich's assertion that Congress would try to undo a two-year-old compromise policy on homosexuals in the military. \"This certainly isn't a part of the Contract With America,\" said Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican on the Armed Services Committee. \"We firmly believe there is not a problem with the existing law.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950404","headline":"Man Pleads Guilty in the Kidnapping of His Boss","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/04/nyregion/man-pleads-guilty-in-the-kidnapping-of-his-boss.html","abstract":"  First, there was the Fermin Rodriguez who worked behind a sewing machine for eight years, making pants for tuxedos.
