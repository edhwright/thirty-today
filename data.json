One of New York's institutions, the Monday-night big band at the Village Vanguard gets its annual one-week show. It's a band with all sorts of arranging; its strength is its colors and its soloists. It's also, mistakenly, taken for granted. Shows today and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is no third show on Sunday. There is a $12 cover and an $8 minimum for all shows. PETER WATROUS Jacky Terrasson    Jacky Terrasson, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. The pianist Jacky Terrasson is a master of dynamics, and his trio, with Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Leon Parker on drums, is tight, concise and empathetic. The band is also dedicated to swinging, and it gets a light but furious forward motion going. Mr. Terrasson isn't afraid of strange chords and unusual juxtapositions; he traffics in surprise. Shows through tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.; there is a $15 cover and an $8 minimum. P. W.

Little Jimmy Scott's piercing wail infuses everything he sings with an aura of metaphysical lamentation. The songs are mostly ballad standards that lend themselves to a keening rhythm-and-blues style, suggesting a hybrid of Dinah Washington and Little Anthony. The program focuses on songs from Mr. Scott's forthcoming album, \"Dream\" (Warner Brothers). He is backed by a quartet led by the pianist Ken Ichi Shimazu. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and at 8:30 and 10:30 on Sunday night. There is a music charge of $23.50 tonight and tomorrow and $17.50 on Sunday. S. H. Jazz Album of the Week    Kevin Hays, \"Seventh Sense,\" (Blue Note; CD only, $10.99). For those who love the more experimental albums recorded by Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson and Andrew Hill on the Blue Note label in the 1960's, \"Seventh Sense\" is a jolt of joy. Mr. Hays, a pianist best known for his association with the tenor saxophonist Josh Redman, has assembled an excellent band (including Seamus Blake on saxophones, Steve Nelson on vibes, Doug Wiess on bass and Brian Blade on drums) that wheels its way through his open, moody compositions along with works by -- surprise -- Bobby Hutcherson and Joe Henderson. Although the recording isn't well sequenced -- three slow tunes in the middle make it a bit hard to listen to -- it captures the charge that experimentation had in the mid-1960's, when harmonic and rhythmic exploration merged with a solid grounding of swing. It helps that the rhythm section drives so hard; this is an album built on the relationship between piano and vibes and a roaring bass and drums. P.

As she lay dying neighbors asked me to defend the tumult caused by a dozen television minivans, several large satellite uplink trucks and bright lights playing on the building's Fifth Avenue facade.   The television journalists who had to do the difficult job also felt the loss. They were orderly and respectful. They hoped their lights would not disturb Mrs. Onassis or her family.   Yet it should have been possible to reduce redundant equipment. Pool cameras could have provided adequate coverage at the front of the building.

Eugene Smith became famous as the model of the committed photojournalist, renowned for the extended picture essays he made for Life magazine on such subjects as a country doctor in Colorado and the life of a Spanish village. Smith would immerse himself in his stories, sometimes spending months working on one; his essays, combining equal measures of reportage and sentiment, were hailed as classics of the medium.    Since Smith's death in 1978, at the age of 59, his reputation as a photographer has been somewhat eclipsed by stories of his troubled personal life, which was punctuated by battles with editors and struggles with alcohol and amphetamines. This valuable show offers a chance to reconsider Smith's work, presenting as it does many of his best-known images, from his 1950 shot of a Spanish woman, clad in black, spinning thread, to his 1958 picture of a woman in a Haitian mental asylum, her eyes gleaming out of the darkness around her.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Schools Official to Leave","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/nyregion/schools-official-to-leave.html","abstract":"  Amy Linden, the director of the Board of Education's Facilities Division, said yesterday that she would be leaving her post July 1.

STEPHEN HOLDEN 'Jelly Roll Morton'    Vernel Bagneris in \"Jelly Roll Morton: Hoo-Dude,\" Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2272. Vernel Bagneris, a performer steeped in New Orleans jazz culture, creates an absorbing portrait of the seminal jazz pianist and composer as a charming wheeler-dealer who is proud of his Creole roots and is deeply superstitious. The dialogue, adapted from Morton's taped reminiscences for the Library of Congress, is smoothly interwoven with vigorous piano performances of many of his pieces by Ray Smith, who is substituting this weekend for the show's regular pianist, Gunnar Larsen. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9:15 and 11:15.  There is a $20 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. S.

last five years. With unemployment on the rise and immigrants still streaming in looking for work, people by the thousands have turned to hawking goods illegally in the streets. Street vendors and their clamor are an integral part of life in the city. But the makeshift markets they create often make sidewalks impassable, allow opportunities for protection rackets and undercut legitimate merchants.   The Giuliani administration is right to crack down on illegal vendors, especially on dangerously crowded thoroughfares like Harlem's 125th Street. But the administration must also make it easier for those who wish to operate within the law to do so. That means creating more vendor licenses and establishing locations where they can sell their wares without creating a hazard to public safety.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940528","headline":"Foes in Cambodia's Civil War Begin Talks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/28/world/foes-in-cambodia-s-civil-war-begin-talks.html","abstract":"  Leaders of the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas gathered in North Korea for a new round of talks today, almost one year after the election that was supposed to bring peace to a nation still torn by civil war.

A mainland tour bus rolls onto the dock, followed by a minivan topped by a bicycle and a canoe, two RV's towing motorboats, and station wagons filled with excited kids in bathing suits. This summer scene is so familiar on resort islands across the United States, but for us Easterners, there's a twist. This island is in Wisconsin.

To his Minnesotan wife and their children, Lake Superior is just one of the 10,000 lakes of which their Minnesota license plate boasts. To us, residents of Long Island, where the water out our windows is the Atlantic Ocean, the inland vastness and volatility of Lake Superior seem exotic.

An inning later, Jim Leyritz, who temporarily became the regular catcher because of injuries to Mike Stanley and Matt Nokes, hit his ninth home run of the season to give the Yankees the lead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"DISTANT ISLE, FAR REACHES FEW VISITORS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/travel/distant-isle-far-reaches-few-visitors.html","abstract":"THE inevitable word for Isle Royale, the largest island in Lake Superior, is \"remote.\" When my 13-year-old son, Andrew, and I were planning our six-day camping trip there last August, we were surprised to discover that the 600-mile drive from our house in Ann Arbor to the island ferry at Copper Harbor, traversing Michigan from its southeastern corner to the northern tip of its Upper Peninsula, was about the same as from Ann Arbor to New York City.

The case, in the Small Claims part of New York City's Civil Court, does not constitute an overwhelming precedent; the judge says her decision was based on narrow grounds. But she followed her award with a written decision, an unusual step in Small Claims Court. And the plaintiff, Prof. Carl J. Mayer of the Hofstra University Law School on Long Island, and others on the antismoking ramparts believe the small claims forum provides an opening against foreign airlines whose overseas flights do not generally fall under United States smoking restrictions. They are sometimes deaf to the pleas of travelers unable to tolerate smoke.  Neighbors Light Up    Professor Mayer's saga began in a way familiar to many nonsmokers who fly abroad. On Aug. 1, 1990, he was returning to New York from Moscow through Paris on Air France Flight 079. He confirmed his reservation for a nonsmoking seat with an agent. At the gate, he again confirmed it and got a nonsmoking boarding pass for seat 34D. Before takeoff, his testimony said, he saw passengers around him in rows 33 and 35 smoking, and they resumed after takeoff. Passengers to his left in row 34 also started smoking. Professor Mayer complained, and the steward said that smokers and nonsmokers had been mixed because of a computer problem.

No recent building that I can recall reels in the surreal as stylishly as the new Cartier building in Paris designed by Jean Nouvel, the French architect best known for the Arab World Institute. Some buildings go up in flames. This one melts away like ice. Its crystalline, geometrically precise surfaces of glass and steel dissolve in the light into silhouettes, clouds, reflections, the traffic, trees and skyline of historic Montparnasse.   Talk about Les Must. Those headed to Paris this summer will want to put 261 Boulevard Raspail at the top of their itinerary. For once, the support that the French extend to contemporary architecture inspires not only respect for good intentions but awe at a building it has produced. You can linger here for an hour or longer and not begrudge the time subtracted from a visit to Ste.-Chapelle. In fact these two very different landmarks have something in common: both join the architect's art to the jeweler's.

Among the visitors affected are those taking package trips with tour operators who were previously able to obtain blocks of rooms at extremely low rates. Now that the family market is expanding, major hotels are raising the rates charged to wholesalers in hopes of reclaiming some of the otherwise pre-sold rooms and offering them to families willing to pay rack rates, the rates quoted over the telephone to individual travelers. For example, a couple flying from the East Coast to Las Vegas on a package that included air fare, transfers and accommodations at the MGM Grand paid $928 last month, said Christopher DeSanto, vice president of Santo Tours of Buffalo. That same package is expected to cost about $975 in September. (Next month, however, it will be $906, largely because of lower demand in the summer. Before the room rate increase, though, the June package would have been $798.) Another tour operator, Ray Daley, executive vice president of Apple Vacations East of Newtown Square, Pa., said he expected increases of $60 to $80 a couple for four-night packages from the East Coast in the fall. Earlier this month, a package that included air fare and accommodations at Excalibur was $710.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Ancient Rock in Crosscurrents of Today","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/us/ancient-rock-in-crosscurrents-of-today.html","abstract":"  On Sundays at St. Thomas the Apostle Church, in a gang-ridden area near downtown, the pews fill up for the Spanish-English Mass at 10:45.

Comparisons can be useful if they illuminate the obscure or help resolve a problem. But simply likening the events of 1991 and the events of 1994 ignores the complexities of sexual harassment. As the Supreme Court noted just last year, sexual harassment that creates a hostile environment defies \"a mathematically precise test,\" and calls for examining \"all the circumstances\" of a case.

In Congressional testimony Feb. 23, Kenneth Brody, Eximbank president and chairman, called procedures \"obviously unsatisfactory,\" acknowledging they had to be \"substantially strengthened.\" Eximbank's activities should be transparent and publicly accountable, and consistent with United States environmental foreign policy, including the Rio Climate and Biodiversity Conventions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Sculptural Works That Defy the Limitations of Definition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/nyregion/art-sculptural-works-that-defy-the-limitations-of-definition.html","abstract":"  TOM DOYLE, a past master at combining sections of tree trunks with beams transformed into undulating limbs, seems very much at home in the Quietude Garden Gallery, at 24 Fern Road in East Brunswick.

Mr. Ginsberg was not then, in his words, \"a big picture taker\": he produced only 30 rolls of film between 1953 and 1963. Explaining why he took the pictures at all, Mr. Ginsberg writes that he simply \"had a sacramental sense of these friends.\" Encouraged and taught by such renowned photographers as Robert Frank and Berenice Abbott, Mr. Ginsberg developed into a gifted pictorial chronicler. Among the most appealing of these photographs (each accompanied by a caption handwritten by the photographer) is the \"heroic portrait\" of Jack Kerouac smoking a cigarette on a fire escape in New York City. Another shot shows Neal Cassady and Natalie Jackson embracing beneath a movie marquee advertising Marlon Brando in \"The Wild One.\" The book also features the now-famous photograph of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and his dog, Whitman, in San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore; portraits of such usual suspects as William Burroughs and Gregory Corso; and several fine, unflinching self-portraits. Snappily designed, \"Snapshot Poetics\" is an evocative riff on a specific slice of time in American literary history.\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Typed Orders by Phone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/travel/travel-advisory-tickets-typed-orders-by-phone.html","abstract":"  For customers with impaired hearing or speech, 1-800-Fly Cheap (359-2432), a telephone travel agency specializing in discounted airline tickets, has installed a text telephone system.
