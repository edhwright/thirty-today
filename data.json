At the moment, evidence of their influence can be found, quite literally, all over town, in the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum, in Peter Saul's paintings at the Frumkin Gallery on West 57th Street and in the SoHo shows of the young painter Christian Schumann at Postmasters and the sculptor Daniel Weiner at Germans van Eck.    But enough about influence. A sizable portion of the real thing is now having its say in \"Comic Power,\" a sprawling survey organized by John Carlin and Carlo McCormick, with the assistance of Melissa Rachleff, at Exit Art/The First World, in SoHo. Admittedly, the comics under scrutiny are not, for the most part, the all-American kind that influenced Pop artists like Mr. Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol or the lapsed Abstract Expressionist Philip Guston, although a historical section devoted to newspaper comic strips from 1898 to 1945 includes examples of Chester Gould's \"Dick Tracy\" and George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"Breeders' Cup Countdown Begins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/sports/horse-racing-notebook-breeders-cup-countdown-begins.html","abstract":"  Belmont Park started its countdown to the Breeders' Cup yesterday when a dozen of the leading contenders for 1993 championships were entered in this weekend's major stakes here, one month before they gather again with all of the horse clans for the main event.

Combat\" and \"Secret Hearts\" (\"I don't care! I'd rather sink -- than call Brad for help!\"), not even his most ardent admirers could have predicted how rich a creative vein he had tapped. Everyone saw at the time -- how could they have seen otherwise? -- the giant pin that was Mr. Lichtenstein's art aimed at the hot-air balloon of Abstract Expressionism. He was regarded as a saboteur and a provocateur, but how far could he go with those big, cartoonish spoofs?   Very far, it turns out. So far, in fact, that the end is still not in sight. What makes the gigantic Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum so particularly remarkable is this almost miraculous sense of unfolding possibilities. Ideas tumble out of his work like circus clowns out of a Volkswagen. By the time you reach the top of the museum's ramp you may well wonder how the same artist who in 1961 was cribbing from an advertisement for Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos to come up with an image of a girl holding a beach ball could have conceived in the 1980's and early 90's vast compositions that seamlessly weave references to Picasso and Magritte, the Futurists and Expressionists, not to say to Mr. Lichtenstein himself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"Review/Film; Waking Up In a Future Of Muscles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/movies/review-film-waking-up-in-a-future-of-muscles.html","abstract":"Typical futuristic action-melodrama.

With music by Ezra Laderman and a libretto by the poet and playwright Norman Rosten, this portrait of Marilyn Monroe's final months has been one of the most publicized new operas in years. All three performances (the others are tomorrow and Tuesday) were sold out in advance.   The work, a City Opera commission, opened a world-premiere festival in honor of the company's 50th anniversary, in which three new works are being presented on consecutive evenings. But unless one comes to \"Marilyn\" already obsessed by Monroe's mixture of come-hither glances and childlike behavior; unless one finds her death tragic rather than merely sad, there will be very little in this opera to justify three hours of dutiful attention.

Maxwell's four-hour cinematic re-creation of the battle that was the turning point of the Civil War has a stately tone and meticulous attention to historical detail that make it feel more like an epic documentary than a dramatic film. \"Gettysburg,\" adapted by Mr. Maxwell from Michael Shaara's novel \"The Killer Angels,\" limits itself to the first three days of July 1863, when 150,000 soldiers threw themselves into a battle in which more than a quarter of them became casualties.    Probably no American movie has devoted more time to discussions of battlefield strategy than \"Gettysburg,\" which is a film to warm the cockles of a military tactician's heart. Its battle scenes, which used more than 5,000 Civil War re-enactors surging over the actual site of the original conflict, are impressively choreographed. In their sweep and grandeur, these scenes convey a strong visceral sense of what fighting a war used to be like.

His chief nemesis, Pine Chip, stormed to a record-setting victory by six and a half lengths. After finishing second to Pine Chip in the first heat by a stunning eight lengths, American Winner, who captured the Yonkers Trot and Hambletonian earlier in the year, figured to come back with a fury in the second heat.

Lukas Foss meant \"Griffelkin,\" an opera about a 10-year-old devil who can't quite succeed in hell, to appeal to both children and adults, and I think it will. If the revised version of the score, which had its premiere on Thursday night, were pruned, particularly in the second act, it could become a minor classic.   \"Griffelkin\" avoids almost all the pitfalls of adult works about, and partly for, children: it swerves into sentimentality without becoming mawkish; it celebrates innocence without being banal, and it never condescends to its characters or its subject. Mr. Foss's score, which includes a fair number of academic niceties (including a canon and lighthearted allusions to Mozart), is instantly accessible, managing to recall Stravinsky, Copland and hints of the young Leonard Bernstein, while still sounding original. It has its longueurs and times of forced gaiety and tumult, particularly in the last half of the second act (the first act could easily be combined with the second), but the third act is strikingly sure-footed. Overall, Mr. Foss's wry music is a fine foil for Alastair Reid's literate, often rhyming libretto.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931009","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/09/arts/classical-music-in-review-229793.html","abstract":"  Chie Sato Roden  Pianist Weill Recital Hall","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931009","headline":"Religion Notes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/09/us/religion-notes.html","abstract":"  Ecumenically Environmental   When you talk about grass roots, you can't get much more local than the houses of worship that dot every city in America.

He got a visit from the top Democrat in the United States, President Clinton.   The President officially came to New Jersey to lobby in support of his health care package. But in one short speech before an enthusiastic crowd at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Mr. Clinton managed, through the issue of violence in America, to link his health care proposals to one of the most popular planks in Mr. Florio's campaign: gun control.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931009","headline":"Judge Considering Offer of Bail To Defendant in Bomb-Plot Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/09/nyregion/judge-considering-offer-of-bail-to-defendant-in-bomb-plot-case.html","abstract":"  The judge in the case of the foiled plot to bomb New York City targets said yesterday that he was considering releasing one of the 15 defendants on bail. All have so far been denied bail and remain in jail on the ground that they pose a danger to the community and might flee.   At a bail hearing at Federal District Court in Manhattan for the defendant, Earl Gant of Philadelphia, his lawyer, Andrew Patel, argued that Mr. Gant had become involved with the other defendants under the impression that he was being recruited to fight for Muslims in Bosnia. Mr. Patel said that secretly recorded tapes of conversations between Mr. Gant and a Government informer showed that Mr. Gant had been unaware of any plot to bomb the United Nations and Hudson River tunnels. 'A Close Issue'    A Government prosecutor, Robert Khuzami, contended that Mr. Gant had agreed to provide guns for the plot and had taken part in paramilitary training in a Brooklyn safe house.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931009","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/09/nyregion/c-corrections-212293.html","abstract":"  A brief notice in Weekend yesterday headed \"Where and When,\" about the New York Public Library exhibition on the Dead Sea Scrolls, misstated the library's telephone number.

NBC, committed to 22 episodes of Steven Spielberg's \"Seaquest DSV,\" is betting that a talking dolphin can do the trick. ABC, giving Superman still another whirl in \"Lois and Clark,\" is going with a hunk in a red cape. Freighted with elaborate sets and special effects, the new productions are expensive and ambitious. They obviously relish the possibility of toppling Ms. Lansbury's sweet old Jessica Fletcher.    Seaquest DSV (it means deep submergence vehicle) is a futuristic submarine patrolling and exploring the world's waters in 2018. A consultant to the series, Dr. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer who found the sunken Titanic, insists that this is not science fiction, but that the show is predicting the future. The pragmatic Mr. Spielberg, still looking for a television hit after the disappointments of \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Family Dog,\" is more flexible.

Dismissed from office by a hostile President on charges of abuse of power, Ms. Bhutto was beaten at the polls by Nawaz Sharif. Now, in a dramatic comeback, her left-of-center party has just outvoted Mr. Sharif's business-oriented Pakistan Muslim League.   This is sweet vindication for Benazir Bhutto, and for the most part, good news for Pakistan. The big losers were militant Islamic parties, which won only 9 seats in the 217-seat Parliament. After years of dictatorship and turbulence, Pakistan seems to be evolving a stable two-party system. Mr. Sharif has emerged as a leader in his own right, and can no longer be dismissed as a tool of the military.

For many this involves scaling back traditional pursuits, such as wool production, and exploring new markets such as tourism. Working farms, known as stations or properties, that accept guests are now a common feature in every state; there are over 1,000 throughout Australia.

In 1989, when the New York-based organization devoted to supporting composers and expanding the audience for new music began giving money to jazz composers, it was a fairly radical thing to do. And the definition of jazz implicit in the grants, like that in much of the jazz community, has been resolutely open-minded; almost any form of improvisation, according to that interpretation, constitutes jazz.   It's a perspective good enough for a living-room discussion, but when it manifests itself in policy it can become problematic, as this year's grants demonstrate. The Pacific Rim Players, an unrecorded big band from Oregon, received $30,000 and is commissioning Wayne Horvitz, Robin Holcomb and Bob Nell to write pieces for it.

It is a more urban place than it once was, denser and tenser and busier than ever. Its citizens are less inclined to fool themselves into believing that escape brings freedom from the woes that afflict other cities, less willing to pretend that Los Angeles is as different from other cities as they once thought.   It's against this background of growing urban consciousness that the city's decision to spend $214 million on a library in the middle of its downtown has to be viewed. This library is not only a place of books but a statement about urbanism, a statement about Los Angeles's increasing willingness to let itself be like other, older cities. Designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a New York and Los Angeles firm with what could be called a highly urban sensibility, the project almost didn't happen at all.

Officials suggested that this \"difference\" is due to the large number of women exposed to crime while working late at night. The clear message is that women are at greater risk of being murdered in the workplace than men.   A critical reading of other statistics in the article discloses an entirely different picture. Men account for 93 percent of all job-related deaths, although only 55 percent of the work force is male.   What this means is that less than 3 percent (40 percent of 7 percent) of workplace deaths are female murders, while almost 14 percent (15 percent of 93 percent) are male murders. If we then take account of the differential representation of the sexes in the work force, we can see that a man is almost four times as likely to be murdered in the workplace as a woman and that a man is more than 11 times as likely as a woman to be killed on the job by all causes combined.   Thus, the reason that a greater proportion of female deaths in the workplace are murders is not that women are murdered at a higher rate than men, because they are not. It is rather that men are killed at a higher rate by other causes.   The slant of this report is symptomatic of the treatment of virtually any statistics that show differences between men and women. It is almost as if a conscious decision had been made along the line to report the information in a way to reinforce the notion that women are being victimized. KINGSLEY R.

Despite that record, there was a full house of 15,635 at the Civic Center. Many of those in attendance took advantage of a free ticket offer.(AP) TENNIS Another Yzaga Upset  Jaime Yzaga of Peru continued his giant-killing run at the Australian Indoor championships last night in Sydney, beating the defending champion, Goran Ivanisevic, 6-3, 6-4. Ivanisevic is ranked ninth in the world and had won 10 matches in a row. The unseeded Yzaga, ranked 54th, will face sixth-seeded Petr Korda in today's final. Korda defeated Wayne Ferreira, 6-3, 6-2. (AP) Navratilova Advances: Top-seeded Martina Navratilova went a step closer to another title yesterday when she moved into the European Indoors final in Zurich. Navratilova scored a 6-3, 6-4 semifinal victory over third-seeded Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria. Maleeva's oldest sister, fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, won the other semifinal, beating Stephanie Rottier by 6-2, 7-5. (AP) GOLF Stadler Shares Lead  Craig Stadler was one of the lucky players at the rain-delayed Walt Disney World-Oldsmobile Classic yesterday in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. He got in the last six holes of the second round of the $1 million PGA Tour event in the morning, then shot a four-under-par 68 for 203 to grab a share of the lead with Ed Humenik among the third-round finishers before an afternoon thunderstorm stopped play for the second straight day. Not only was much of the field still scattered over three courses being used for the tournament, but Jeff Maggert and Skip Kendall -- two-thirds of the threesome who led after 36 holes -- hadn't even begun the third round. That means some players will have to play 36 holes today if tournament officials meet a goal of getting in 72 holes without delaying the finish until tomorrow. (AP)   Shaw Comes Up 68 Again: Tom Shaw shot a 4-under-par 68 yesterday and took a one-stroke lead over Simon Hobday in the $600,000 Transamerica Senior Golf Championship at Napa, Calif. Shaw's second straight 68 left him with an 8-under 136 total after 36 holes on the south course at Silverado Country Club. Hobday carded the tournament's lowest round, a 66. Lee Trevino, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Gary Player and Al Geiberger were two strokes behind entering Sunday's final round. (AP) Neumann Leads by 3: Liselotte Neumann birdied the first two holes en route to a 70 and a three-stroke lead in the Takara Invitational in Hino, Japan. (AP) BOWLING Weber Is Top Qualifier  American Pete Weber extended his lead yesterday and finished as the top qualifier for the championship round of the Japan Cup, a professional bowling tournament in Tokyo between the United States and Japan. Weber knocked down 7,367 pins and collected a total of 8,132 points. Yasutomo Bannai of Japan was the second-highest qualifier. (AP) SOCCER Tranmere Moves Closer  Tranmere improved its chances for its first berth in England's top soccer league with 2-1 victory over Bolton yesterday to move into first place in Division One. Foward Pat Nevin scored the winning goal with nine minutes to play. The Premier League had the day off in advance of England's World Cup qualifier Wednesday at the Netherlands. Tranmere, in the Football League since 1921, has never played among England's elite, but a finish in the top two would grant the Rovers an automatic place in the Premier League next season.

At the onset of World War I, Italy had enjoyed less than half a century of unified statehood. Its artistic aspirations were suspended between the Fascist desire for an undiluted Italy and the belle epoque's romance with nature, between a mimicry of other European styles and the reincorporation of Italy's own classical legacy, between a giddy quest for an avant-garde and a vernacular means to persuade a population, 30 percent of which was illiterate, to feel optimism amid an economic crisis. As Mr. Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Ms. Fili, a New York designer, show, the resultant style incorporated a humanizing of technology, a mythic treatment of contemporary imagery, and airbrushed shapes that suggested an egoless production. While the Futurists' work by self-definition was a reckless, audacious movement -- for industry it proved frivolous, for advertising almost useless -- the resulting graphic work extracted the workable, pragmatic aspects otherwise buried in the rarefied bombast of art manifestoes. \"Italian Art Deco\" displays the objects of Italy's longed-for arte-vita, the availability of art in everyday life. Fifty years later, the Art Moderne designers' dreams of a future with radio, air travel and robots has been fulfilled, and still their designs possess the radiance of a charmed modernity.\nMICHAEL J.

Q.  What inspired this book?   A.  That kind of question is so hard to answer.   Q.  O.K. Was there a reason you were thinking about issues like a breakdown in civility in middle-class America?   A.  The ideas and the issues raised in the book are probably related to things I think about, but they are also just in the air.   Q.  Like what things?   A.  Well, pick an example. Schools are closing down. I remember when I decided that the schools in the book have actually closed down because of a taxpayer vote. That day, I picked up the paper and the taxpayers in some California county had closed down the schools. I've also been in plenty of towns in suburban neighborhoods that have been heavily fortified. People build walls and have video cameras and guard stations.   Q.  Tell me about your style.   A.  I decided that I would write it without any space breaks or chapters, and that was just a technical decision. It was formal. I thought of it as a challenge.   Q.  When you write something as dark as this book -- for instance, a young girl is murdered while Pete looks on -- does it concern you that readers might wonder what kind of guy would even think of these things?   A.  Sure, but that's the book I wrote. It's a work of fiction. I don't walk around worrying about it, but it's crossed my mind and there were times before the book came out where I became very uncomfortable and fidgety. But it is also liberating to write a character who is not necessarily redeemed. That's a great freedom, but yeah, there is something uncomfortable in the overlap between author and book. This is a long way of saying, \"Yes and no.\"   Q.  Do you answer \"yes and no\" to a lot of questions?   A.

Here are his recommendations. BROOKLYN  GAGE & TOLLNER  (718) 875-5181; 372 Fulton Street, near Smith Street, downtown Brooklyn; all major credit cards    The area around Borough Hall is a field of fast-food restaurants, with stores and offices seemingly just filling the spaces between hamburger stands, pizza places and fried-chicken joints. Fortunately, Gage & Tollner, the bastion of seafood and Southern cooking, lives on, its dignified face blinking a little awkwardly in the tackiness of Fulton Mall.   The gas lamps for which the dark mahogany dining room is renowned are not lighted at lunchtime, but even under electric lights the restaurant retains its turn-of-the-century patina, with arching mirrors, felt-covered walls and a ceiling that wears the residue of more than 100 years of tobacco smoke. Office workers, courthouse regulars and politicians are in attendance at lunch, when there is an $18.95 fixed-price three-course meal and quick lunches ranging from $7.95 to $12.95. Otherwise, lunch can rise into the $25 to $40 range.   This is a chance to sample the peppery she-crab soup, big meaty crab cakes, and a wide variety of fish and shellfish dishes, like pan-roasted clam bellies and fried oysters.   Bourbon pecan pie seems like a perfect (Southern) courthouse dessert, not too sweet, but still as excessive as a good prosecutor's oratory. QUEEN    (718) 596-5954; 84 Court Street, near Livingston Street, downtown Brooklyn; cash only    For Italian meals of a less nostalgic nature, try Queen, a relative newcomer at 35 years of age. There is a brightly dowdy, almost middle-American feel to the dining room, with its blond-wood chairs and pastel colors. The food is a cut more inventive than old-style Italian.   Appetizers are so big that jurors hoping to stay awake for closing arguments can make a meal of a dish like sweet fava beans sauteed in butter and olive oil with earthy cremini mushrooms and tender baby artichokes for $8. Those planning to nap the afternoon away can indulge in a main course of homemade ravioli stuffed with a savory puree of cannellini beans and tomato in a tart balsamic vinegar sauce for $13.   Service is friendly yet formal. A waiter supplements the big basket of bread with piping-hot fingers of fried pizza dough tasting faintly of cheese. THE BRONX Court Deli  (718) 993-1380; 96 East 161st Street, South Bronx; cash only    Bronx Borough Hall looms over 161st Street, as busy a block as any in midtown Manhattan. But where are the restaurants? The area has nothing more to offer than a few coffee shops and bars. \"We just had a tuna fish sandwich sent in from a local pizza joint,\" one courthouse regular said. \"We don't have too many five-star places near the courthouse.\"   When the courthouse regulars do eat out, many go to the Court Deli, a plain but thriving restaurant across the street with linoleum-tile floors, a crowded takeout counter, and gruff but personable waitresses.    Apart from a thick, lusty split pea soup and the sizzling hot dogs, the food is mediocre, probably no better than at Yankee Stadium down the street. The overstuffed sandwiches are generous enough, but pastrami is strictly one-dimensional; it spends too much time on the steam table. But the coffee is good and rich. QUEENS  PASTRAMI KING  (718) 263-1717; 124-24 Queens Boulevard, at 82d Avenue, Kew Gardens; American Express    Jurors assigned to the Kew Gardens courthouse on Queens Boulevard are culinarily fortunate: mavens know that the boulevard is the home of Pastrami King, a classic New York deli that serves world-class pastrami.   Dim, disheveled and full of Formica, this is a place for raucous family gatherings, where babies squeal and adults complain. It's also a clubhouse for the courtroom types and politicos. And it's a place for solitary pleasures, for contemplative chewing of the rich, garlicky pastrami, suffused with an almost vinegary smokiness that comes from 10 to 16 days of soaking and curing over smoldering cedar.   A sandwich is $5.95, and a good-looking, juicy hot dog with sauerkraut is $1.50. Matzoh ball soup ($2) is thin and pallid. MAX'S EATERY  (718) 526-9819; 9504 Sutphin Boulevard, at 95th Avenue, Jamaica; cash only   Jurors at the Jamaica courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard are likely to be a rather hostile group, if the availability of food is any gauge. Simply put, there's not much around. The most worthy spot within walking distance is Max's, an old-time luncheonette several dilapidated blocks south of the courthouse.   Max's does not look much better than the neighborhood. Signs are hand-scrawled, the linoleum-tile floors have seen cleaner days, and coffee is served in plastic foam cups rather than in china mugs. But waitresses call you \"Hon,\" and the polyglot clientele of residents, construction workers and courthouse personnel exudes an aura of good feelings. The Maxi-Burger is big and juicy, served on a fresh poppy-seed roll and strewn with fried onions ($4.70 with bacon and cheese). There are also thick sandwiches and egg creams, and Max Rogalski himself, an aged presence, oversees his bustling staff, lunching on two slices of tomato. STATEN ISLAND  LIL'S EATERY  (718) 273-9555; 95 Stuyvesant Place, at Hamilton Avenue, St. George; cash only    For Staten Islanders, who serve their jury duty within walking distance of the ferry to Manhattan, the temptation to hop aboard for a lunch trip must be great. Rather than risk a tardy return, though, jurors tend to restrict themselves to several fast-food spots in the area, or to Lil's Eatery, a small luncheonette decorated with posters that pay charming homage to stars who met tragic ends, like Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland.   Lil's is a smoky place, with fluorescent lights, Formica tables and an ancient jukebox at each booth, with choices ranging from Bing Crosby to Prince. The menu doesn't stray far from breakfast dishes, sandwiches and burgers. An onion-and-pepper omelet ($5.25) was greasy, and pancakes ($4.95) were doughy, but service was friendly and agreeable. Lil's offers more ambitious specials, like pasta with eggplant for $11.95 and shrimp creole for $12.95. Given the limited choices in the area, I vote for experimentation. MANHATTAN  NHA TRANG  (212) 233-5948; 87 Baxter Street, Chinatown; cash only    With Chinatown right next door to the various courthouses, the choices for the Manhattan juror can be paralyzing. Nha Trang, a plain storefront restaurant with terrific Vietnamese food, stands out. There's a huge menu of more than 100 dishes. Some of the best include perfectly fried spring rolls ($3.50); steamed ravioli, rice-noodle crepes wrapped around minced pork and ground mushrooms, served with mild Vietnamese pork sausage ($3.50), and barbecued shrimp on sugar cane ($5.25). A full meal should cost less than $15.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"THEORY ON MAKEUP OF UNIVERSE GAINS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/us/theory-on-makeup-of-universe-gains.html","abstract":"  In their efforts to understand the formation of galaxies and evolution of the universe as a whole, scientists have come to suspect that some unknown, invisible matter almost certainly makes up more than 90 percent of the mass in the universe.

For more than a decade, the leading theory envisaged a universe full of slow-moving exotic particles, as yet undiscovered, known as cold dark matter. Some scientists favored hot dark matter, particles that traveled close to the speed of light.

The 12 dragons, as local folk can tell you, used to bully and oppress the peasants along the Yangtze. Then Yao Ji showed up on the top of a nearby cloud and pointed her finger at the dragons, killing them. Unfortunately, the goddess hadn't thought the problem through. The bodies of the dragons left 12 huge mountains that blocked the river and turned the region into a huge sea.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"The Ferocious Fauve","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/books/the-ferocious-fauve.html","abstract":"MATISSE\nA Portrait.\nBy Hayden Herrera.\nIllustrated. 223 pp. New York:\nHarcourt Brace & Company. $29.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"What Is This Thing Called Baby Film?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/style/camera-what-is-this-thing-called-baby-film.html","abstract":"  THIS summer, my wife and I had a baby, and in doing so we entered the strange land of Baby Pictures.

A newer building has rooms that are infinitely less charming than the main building; indeed, they're rather lifeless.

Giuliani, sits in front of a painting in a room that could be an office or living room. As she speaks, an image of Mr. Giuliani, casually dressed and surrounded by parents and children, comes on the screen. Then the image of Ms. Giuliani, dressed in a white blouse and blue jacket, returns and the camera pans closer to her until at the end she is being filmed in closeup. Producer; The Garth Group of New York The Script: Ms. Giuliani: Let me tell you about my husband's record on women's rights. In his law practice, Rudy fought for split schedules and extended maternity leave so female lawyers could take care of their families without sacrificing their careers. As U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted an abortion clinic bomber who went to jail for seven years. Rudy helped establish New York City's first on-site childcare center for federal workers and he appointed the first woman in the country to head an Organized Crime Strike Force. And make no mistake about it, Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice. Accuracy: Lawyers who would know whether Mr. Giuliani fought for split schedules as a lawyer in private practice at Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler from 1977 through 1981 could not be reached for comment over the past few days. But in all other respects the commercial is accurate, though perhaps making Mr. Giuliani more central to events than he was. When he was United States Attorney, his office did prosecute the case of Dennis J. Malvasi, an abortion clinic bomber who turned himself in after John Cardinal O'Connor made a televised appeal for him to surrender. He was sentenced in 1987 to seven years in prison. His office was also one of about 10 Federal agencies that provided operating funds for Fedkids, a child care center run by a not-for-profit corporation, that opened in 1988 in 26 Federal Plaza.   And Mr. Giuliani appointed Barbara S. Jones as the first woman in the country to head a federal Organized Crime Strike Force.   Ms. Giuliani winds up her remarks affirming that her husband believes in abortion rights. In 1989, he gave several accounts of his position, before saying that while he opposed aboriton personally as a Roman Catholic, he would support and uphold abortion rights as public policy. Scorecard: The commercial is designed to rebut a commercial by Mayor David N. Dinkins that revives Mr. Giuliani's 1989 hesitations about abortion. It presents his wife, known to New Yorkers as an former anchorwoman for WPIX, to make the case that Mr. Giuliani is a progressive on women's issues. The subliminal message is that if she married him, he has to be someone to whom professional, independent women can relate. The question is whether the same women will see Mr. Giuliani's wife as the best woman to make the case.

The joke works for artists but not photographers, for everyone acknowledges that women photographers have been important all along. Well. When Beaumont Newhall revised his classic \"History of Photography\" in 1982, he increased the number of women mentioned to 13; the first page of his eight-page index lists 38 men. It must be hastily admitted that photography was invented by men and dominated by them well beyond the time that the medium required chemistry and the female sex required smelling salts.   Institutions have not done all that much better than Newhall. Susan Kismaric, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, told a panel last year that at the end of 1990 the Modern owned work by 1,226 photographers, of whom 172 (14 percent) were women. The exhibition record was slightly more respectable: of 70 one-person shows organized by the museum, 20 (or 29 percent) were of women's work. Yet consider that at this moment women are perhaps more prominent in the field of photography than men -- few men with cameras can claim the audience, press attention, even, at times, the prices of Cindy Sherman, Annie Leibovitz or Sally Mann.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"Elena Zazanis, Yannis Moutafidis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/style/weddings-elena-zazanis-yannis-moutafidis.html","abstract":"  Elena George Zazanis, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. George A.

But the infatuation hardly leads to a love duet; instead, the officer comes actively to dislike his wife along with all Japanese (whom he calls monkeys). Unaffected by his scorn, she appears to love him deeply. She weeps and wails as he prepares to depart. But when he returns unexpectedly to his room, he finds that she has not been a helpless innocent trampled in the mud by a Westerner; she counts her money and coolly awaits her next marital contract.   I suspect that this cynical plot would have been less successful than the one Puccini adapted from David Belasco's play. In \"Butterfly,\" the victim is more innocent, and her triumph more subtle: it is in the tears of listeners who despise Pinkerton, his crudity and his cowardice.
