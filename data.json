Some of these paintings have a new looseness and a jangly rhythm that push them to the brink of unread ability, but somehow never over the edge. The best of them, like a portrait of John Chamberlain, threaten to dissolve into so many brilliant lozenges of color. A self-portrait is made up of freewheeling circles, dashes, ovals and dots in a grid of large squares, which, up close, brings to mind the structure and something of the jazziness of Mondrian's \"Broadway Boogie-Woogie\"; you have to stand pretty far back before the abstract patterns congeal into an image of Mr. Close's familiar face.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/nyregion/news-summary-830093.html","abstract":"  International A3-15  TOKYO AUTO MAKERS PINCHED  The yen's rise comes at a bad time for Japanese auto makers, who are seeing car prices pushed up in the United States while sales in Japan are hurting.

In addition to \"Dreams and Shadows\" at the National Academy of Design (review on page C31), there are several group shows, large and small, all of which offer seldom-encountered work.   Two of the exhibitions are at the Metropolitan itself. \"Master Drawings of the Hudson River School\" is a selection of some three dozen works on paper. In broad outlines, the history of American landscape painting is here in a nutshell, from its sleepy topographic beginnings to Thomas Cole's romantic \"Fountain\" (1843), as atmospheric as an opera set. In the tenderly rendered tree studies of Jervis McEntee one finds the blend of pragmatism and poetry that defined the American landscape at its best, a mixture also evident in the work of Frederic Edwin Church. His \"Tequendama Falls Near Bogota, Colombia\" has a gestural burst of white gouache for falling water, but beside it are color notions rendered in a precise, penciled script.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"DO'S AND DON'TS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/style/IHT-dos-and-donts.html","abstract":"One-Parent Family Trips","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Murder Indictment Given In Bucket-Tossing Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/nyregion/murder-indictment-given-in-bucket-tossing-case.html","abstract":"  Citing \"circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,\" a grand jury handed up an indictment of second-degree murder yesterday against the man who threw a bucket from a Washington Heights rooftop that killed a police officer in the street below.

At its core, the Clinton plan would create a web of regional \"health alliances\" to pool the purchasing power of consumers and negotiate on their behalf for lower prices for health insurance. The Clinton system would not necessarily produce new costs -- indeed it is intended to operate more efficiently than what Americans have now -- but it will almost certainly reshuffle the deck in who has to pay the costs of medical care. Sharing Cities' Burdens    The states, not Washington, are to create these new purchasing pools and decide their boundaries.

Meanwhile, TNT has decided to poke once more into the lives of the Fitzgeralds. Graced with one memorable performance, \"Zelda\" can be seen on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. and midnight.    As the title suggests, this portrait of the tempestuous, doomed marriage is seen primarily from the wife's point of view. It starts at a 1918 party in Montgomery, Ala., where a budding writer in World War I uniform puts aside his liquor flask long enough to fall in love with a vivacious young belle named Zelda Sayre, who informs him that \"I always wanted to swim naked in the moonlight.\" It ends more than a decade later, the Roaring 20's over, with Zelda entering a sanitarium and Scott realizing that \"my wife is never going to get well again.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931105","headline":"Administration Offers New Math To Bolster Health Plan's Appeal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/us/administration-offers-new-math-to-bolster-health-plan-s-appeal.html","abstract":"  Struggling to convince Americans that its health care plan would save most people money, the Clinton Administration today produced its third set of predictions of how many Americans would pay more, or less, for health insurance.

At a time when most of the great actors of his generation -- Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman -- have already had their legend-making roles, Mr. Keitel seems at a new stage in his career.    Last year, two independent films that Mr. Keitel starred in and was the executive producer for -- \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Bad Lieutenant\" -- made him the unchallenged godfather of a new macho ethic. He shows a very different face, however, in \"The Piano,\" the much-acclaimed third feature by the New Zealand director Jane Campion, which opens in New York on Friday.

That year, the city government, which had always provided some financing, experienced such severe budget problems that it could not contribute. The parade was canceled. \n\nThe Chamber of Commerce tried to raise money for a 1993 parade, which would have been held on Nov. 20.

His art, characterized by a sweet buoyancy that gives little hint of suffering, enhances his popularity. More modernistic than modern, Modigliani's viewer-friendly nudes and portraits and sculpture heads reduce the human form to smooth, attenuated, yet slightly pneumatic volumes without any loss of comforting recognizability. It's not surprising that his story, which began in Livorno, Italy, in 1884 and ended 36 years later in Paris, was translated into a play in the early 80's.

Here are some suggestions on forming a patrol, from the Citizens Committee for New York City, which helps neighborhood organizations and publishes a wide range of pamphlets with tips on solving local problems.       TAKE A GOOD LOOK Anti-drug patrols don't work everywhere, especially if drugs are sold behind closed doors or if there is drug-related street violence. A door-to-door survey that asks people about drugs and crime in the neighborhood can provide helpful information and identify people interested in a patrol.  FIND VOLUNTEERS The goal is to bring people to an orientation meeting. Residents who belong to a community organization could offer to form a committee to start a patrol.  Churches, clubs and Parent-Teacher Associations can help. Young people should be included in all phases of planning, decision-making and patrolling. As a security measure, advertise the meeting only by phone calls, word of mouth or announcements at trusted community organizations, and consider meeting outside the neighborhood.  ORIENTATION MEETING Ask a volunteer to keep notes. Discuss the possibility of an anti-drug patrol. A patrol leader from another neighborhood could talk about that neighborhood's experience. Summarize the discussion: the area to be patrolled; policies on street confrontation; cooperation with the police, and security measures. Choose a temporary group of patrol leaders.  SECURITY PLANNING Do not publicize the names of the patrol leaders. Maintain close relations with the police and report any threats immediately. Seek safety in numbers through a large patrol, rallies and community meetings. Patrol members should never confront a drug dealer alone. Information on specific dealers should be relayed to a trusted core-group member, but not talked about at open meetings. (For more information, see the Neighborhood Anti-Crime Center sheet on \"The Potential for Violence in Anti-Drug Organizing.\")  POLICE RELATIONS Get in touch with the community affairs officer or unit assigned to work with the community.  TRAIN AND PREPARE Ask the police for training in recognizing drug-dealing situations and signs of crimes in progress, reporting information in a form useful to the police, making accurate descriptions of suspected dealers, calling for help in an emergency and safety on the street.   Among useful materials are handheld two-way radio sets (FM sets have a wider range than those operating on citizens'-band frequencies); printed forms for recording incidents and logging each patrol; notebooks; clipboards; flashlights; whistles and jackets, T-shirts, armbands or other form of identification.   Set up procedures for joining the patrol: for example, being trained in the principles and procedures of the patrol.   BEGIN PATROLLING The kind of patrol will vary with the size and strengths of your group, the kind of drug problem you face and the neighborhood terrain.    A few rules that apply to all patrols:   Plan a regular schedule (based on the days and times when a patrol is most needed and volunteers are available) and a standard route. After a while, try different routes or different times to keep the dealers off balance.   Notify the police each time you go out and return.   Maintain contact via walkie-talkie with a home base, an office or building lobby, perhaps. Home base requires a telephone to call the police.   Go out in a group and appoint a captain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"From Sidelines 'Sis Boom Bah' To Making Tackles on the Field","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/nyregion/from-sidelines-sis-boom-bah-to-making-tackles-on-the-field.html","abstract":"  BRUSHING past two blockers, the defensive right end cut left, lunged and tackled the ball carrier just across the line of scrimmage. \"Tackle by No. 80, Tiffany Sacchi,\" the public address announcer told a crowd of about 200 at Mount Nebo Park on a recent Friday night during a game between the Patriots and the Raiders in the Manchester Midget Football League.

With all such repairs, the difficult part is hiding the repair. Accomplishing that requires care to keep the surface as smooth as possible. Even so, extensive repainting is usually necessary, especially if the paint has faded and new paint does not match.   To repair fine cracks, dents and holes like those from nails, first use a whisk broom or another stiff brush to clean the area. Fill the spot with spackling or joint compound, using a flexible-blade putty knife. After the compound hardens, sand the area with fine or extrafine sandpaper and paint over the spot.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Computer Games With Principles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/education/software-computer-games-with-principles.html","abstract":"  \"LET early education be a sort of amusement,\" Plato wrote.

But this fine line has proved something of a cakewalk for Maxis, a California computer game company that started out with no intention of serving the educational market. The founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, set out with a much more self-interested mission in the mid-1980's. He had been experimenting with video games, but found most too trivial -- \"So what if you shoot up a spaceship?\" But he saw a business and education opportunity in developing games \"that a yuppie adult like me would enjoy,\" he said.

The law's spending limits predictably gave rise to a creative search for loopholes, but on the whole the system worked remarkably well. The positive experience is a tribute to the Campaign Finance Board charged with enforcing the rules -- and a timely lesson for reformers in Congress.   Both Mayor David Dinkins and Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani agreed to participate in the system, which provides public matching funds to municipal candidates who agree to extensive financial disclosure, limits on private contributions and an overall limit on campaign spending. The idea is to curb the influence of big contributors, and to prevent candidates from, in effect, buying City Hall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"High School Football Report","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/sports/high-school-football-report.html","abstract":"  New Jersey  SECOND-HALF SURGE: Rickey Poteete scored three second-half touchdowns as PASSAIC (6-0-1) rallied to defeat PATERSON-KENNEDY (3-4), 20-14. Going into the second half, Passaic coach Ray McCrann had reason to be concerned. His Indians, generally regarded as one of New Jersey's top 10 teams, trailed its Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League rival by 7-0 and was in enemy territory once.   \"The first half was stinko, but the second half was super,\" McCrann said.   Fortunately for McCrann and company, Poteete got Passaic going on the second half's first play, returning the kickoff 90 yards for the tying touchdown.    On Passaic's next possession, it marched 72 yards on 12 plays and took the lead when Poteete ran in from 3 yards out.   Kennedy didn't go down easily though. Halfway through the fourth period, Kennedy drove 64 yards on 9 plays and tied the score when fullback Marion Smallwood ran in from 3 yards out.   It only took Passaic two plays from scrimmage to take the lead back. On a second-and-10, Poteete took the ball off tackle and raced 64 yards for the winning score.   Also helping the Indians was fullback Raymond Santos, who rushed for 94 yards and kicked two extra points.  GREEN KNIGHTS STUFF 'EM: Ian Leffler (9 tackles, 2 sacks) and Pat Destro (2 interceptions, 1 blocked punt, 6 tackles) helped ST.

SHORT-YARD SPECIALIST: Roger Alexander ran for three 1-yard touchdowns as PATERSON-EASTSIDE walloped BLOOMFIELD , 32-6. Quarterback Michael Franklin ran for a team-high 117 yards and a score.

Against one wall, a life-size alcoholic with a bottle in his hand comforts a young prostitute carrying a toy bunny. Nearby, a homeless man's frightened eyes peek out from a cardboard-box shelter. A Rodin-like figure in cape and hat huddles against the cold, while across the room, a fierce-looking man sticks out his tongue at the passing world.   This is not a museum storeroom but a space in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Veterans Affairs Hospital, a mainly psychiatric institution spreading over 220 acres near the Hudson River here. How the sculptures got here is the story of one World War II veteran who found solace at the hospital after decades of mental torment. He died in August at age 67, but his artistry lives on, not only in his figures of the homeless -- awaiting a benefactor with the money to have them bronzed -- but also in the sculpture garden he created at the hospital while he was an inpatient.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"The First Antecedent","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/movies/l-20-bucks-the-first-antecedent-311293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a film scholar, I am moved to comment on Lauren David Peden's article, \" '20 Bucks,' a Film 58 Years Aborning\"  [ Oct. 17 ] .

M. W. Turner is perhaps best known for his alchemical fusings of fire and water, sky and sea, in spectacular atmospheric images in which solid forms, be they ships or castles, seem nearly to dissolve in light and color. To different critics at different times, his monumental canvases have prefigured a range of later styles, from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism. But it is not the more familiar, grand pictures -- of Parliament on fire or Trafalgar battleships -- that are the main subject of this small and charming book, TURNER ON THE THAMES: River Journeys in the Year 1805 (Yale University, $45). Instead, David Hill, an art historian at the University of Leeds, takes the reader on an intimate excursion into a small domain within Turner's work -- the many beautiful, serene sketches he made of the Thames in his first years at Syon Ferry House, which had a view of the river. During that time, Turner escaped from the entangled politics of London's art world, where the Royal Academy was marooned in petty disputes, to paint alfresco on the riverbanks. From his boat, he made oil paintings as well as watercolors; his lustrous oils are delightfully sensuous, with brush marks in thin paint following the grain of the mahogany boards. With an imagination primed with verses by Virgil and Dante (Turner had also been trying to write poetry), the painter transformed many of England's plain and rustic spots into classic idylls, as in \"Isis\" (1806). Painted at Weymouth, the canvas depicts an elegiac vista of arching trees silhouetted against a golden Italianate sky, with a silvery thread of water winding past. But the reader is not forever lost in Turner's ennobling vision; Mr. Hill's animated and meticulous descriptions of Turner's working methods, often including a contemporary photo of the landscape pictured, provide the perfect counterpoint to the artist's dreamy impressions of a great river on its seaward journey.\nSIRI HUNTOON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Skiers' Strolling Fingers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/travel/travel-advisory-book-skiers-strolling-fingers.html","abstract":"  Looking for a masseuse in Killington or a snowboard shop in Whistler, British Columbia?

I speak with some authority, since at various times in my traveling career I have suffered from both versions, to the point where, at worst, I've cut trips short and hightailed it home, and where, at best, this oddly nostalgic, bittersweet longing for things familiar has furrowed even the happiest of my travels with some deep sloughs of despond.   \"Homesickness?\" people are apt to say incredulously when the subject comes up. \"Sick of home is more like it for me.\" And indeed, for many, longing for home is the very last thing on their minds when they are off traveling. But there are others for whom homesickness is a crippling problem, the equal of seasickness, fear of flying, culture shock or any of those other maladies of the traveling life. I suspect if you were to examine the hesitations of that larger-than-you-might-think population who, having the time, money and health to travel, never venture more than a few miles from home, homesickness would be at the root of their timidity. A stint in the army where all you wanted was to get home once again, a spell working in a strange city where no one knew you and no friends were made -- these are the experiences people flee from, so terrifying that the condition of awayness is never risked again.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Deborah Novick, Todd Goldberg","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/style/weddings-deborah-novick-todd-goldberg.html","abstract":"  Deborah Ruth Novick, the daughter of Susan and Jeffrey Novick of Syosset, L.I., was married last evening to Todd Alan Goldberg, a son of Phyllis and Marshall Goldberg of West Orange, N.J.

After watching a short film narrated by President Kennedy on his early career, visitors proceed to four multimedia displays: \"The 1960 Campaign,\" \"The Presidency,\" \"Epilogue\" and \"Legacy.\" Exhibits include re-creations of the 1960 convention hall in Los Angeles, the White House's red-carpeted corridor, the Oval Office and the Attorney General's Office with Robert F. Kennedy's original desk. Throughout the museum, original footage from the Kennedy years is shown; President Kennedy is seen and heard on some 20 video screens. In a dark corridor Walter Cronkite's coverage of the President's assassination plays over and over on a television set. The museum displays formerly ended with the assassination. Now, the last exhibit documents President Kennedy and his family's influence on policy -- a 3.5 ton piece of the Berlin Wall is on view, for instance -- and on people, including President Clinton, who taped a video segment about his encounter with President Kennedy for the museum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"New London's Larger World in a School","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/nyregion/new-london-s-larger-world-in-a-school.html","abstract":"  THE school on Bulkeley Place, near New London's business district, is made of granite blocks and vaulted towers, a reminder of a time when public buildings were constructed with style and not simply as rectangular boxes.

Exercise in the city, like most everything else in the city except stimulation and takeout, is harder to order up than it is in places with dirt roads and country clubs and town pools. And exercise is critical to coping; if you can't burn the toxins, they will burn you.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Miss Clark And Mr. Shachoy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/style/engagements-miss-clark-and-mr-shachoy.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. J.

What he fails to realize is that it was corporate executives -- not the mass audience -- who slashed the budgets of the news divisions at the networks and drastically reduced their ability to cover foreign news.   In the last five years, for example, NBC has closed bureaus in Paris, Rome, Amman, Cairo, Frankfurt and Johannesburg. And when was the last time Mr. Goodman saw a story from Asia on any network? Similar cuts in domestic coverage have prevented a thinned line of correspondents and producers from spending more time on in-depth reportage.   Were corporate executives looking at the bottom line or at ratings books and audience surveys when foreign and domestic staffing was reduced?

Last year our reviewer, John Casey, called it a synergy of the author's \"meditative social vision and storytelling immediacy, of her highly developed technical skill and of her alert heart.\"  JFK: Reckless Youth By Nigel Hamilton. Random House, $15. The first of a projected three-volume biography, this book covers the years from John F. Kennedy's birth, in 1917, to 1946, when he was first elected to office as a Massachusetts Congressman. \"By the very detail and depth of the revelations, the flashes of brilliance and consistency of insight, 'JFK: Reckless Youth' easily takes its place beside the best of recent Presidential portraits,\" Roger Morris said here last year. Random House has also reissued EYEBALL TO EYEBALL: The Inside Story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, by Dino A. Brugioni ($16), the supervisor of aerial reconnaissance photographs at the time.
