The singer and songwriter from Westchester County has grown from a wisecracking, preppy follower of Bob Dylan into a sagacious troubadour whose newest songs about middle age and fatherhood cut more deeply than anything he has written before. Many of those songs are included on his new album, \"History,\" which is the latest chapter in a recording career that has the resonance of a personal journal spanning more than two decades.

The Brazilian singer, who has been a star in her homeland since the mid-1960's, makes more direct connections between samba, soul music and reggae than most of her compatriots. Her show concentrates on uptempo sambas arranged as hybrids of Caribbean and Brazilian styles, performed with a spirited brashness that recalls Chaka Khan with echoes of Tina Turner. Shows are at 9 and 11:15 tonight and tomorrow night. There is a $20 cover charge ($25 for ringside) and a two-drink minimum.

Ms. Haran's sinuously sunny voice recalls the young Doris Day, and her commentary, which interweaves personal anecdotes with pop-historical observations, sustains a level of style and wit that is unprecedented among modern cabaret singers. Shows are at 8 and 10:30 tonight and tomorrow.

The cinematic image has changed hardly at all between \"Young Man With a Horn\" and \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" or \"Mo' Better Blues.\" Yet a late set in early-1990's Manhattan doesn't necessarily take place in the glittering nether worlds of the movies. Wandering among late sets on recent weekends, I've found less haze in the air, more tourists in the seats, the elegant couples replaced by a motley assortment that's likely to include students, bohemian types, couples and groups and plaid-jacketed oddballs.

The project, popularly known as Mass Moca, is billed as the world's largest museum of contemporary art, concentrating on works from the 1960's, 70's and 80's. The ambitious goal is to fill the abandoned Sprague Technologies plant in North Adams, a complex of 28 buildings on 13.5 acres.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930108","headline":"Dinkins Plans Shift in Funds For Homeless","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/08/nyregion/dinkins-plans-shift-in-funds-for-homeless.html","abstract":"  Instead of a sweeping overhaul of New York City's beleaguered shelter system for single adults, Mayor David N.

Quebec Makes 'Em Quiver  The Quebec Nordiques, perennial Adams Division doormats, moved into first place last night when Andrei Kovalenko connected on an overtime goal to give the Nor diques a 3-2 victory over the Bruins in Boston. Kovalenko got his 15th goal of the season at 1 minute 35 seconds of overtime. Claude Lapointe passed from the left boards to the left side of the slot, where Kovalenko one-timed a 30-footer to the left of goalie John Blue. The Nordiques, 6-1 in their last seven games, have 54 points, a point more than Montreal. They had just 52 all last season. Boston, 1-5 in its last six games, had its seven-game unbeaten string against the Nordiques broken. (AP) North Stars 6, Penguins 3: Ulf Dahlen scored three goals and Russ Courtnall added two more as Minnesota, taking advantage of the absence of Mario Lemieux, defeated the Penguins on Pittsburgh ice. Dahlen registered his third career hat trick and the first by a North Star in 41 games this season. On Wednesday night, Lemieux left Pittsburgh's game against Boston in the second period, complaining of a stiff back. He has since been ordered by doctors to rest his back until Jan. 25, and last night he watched from a private box as the Penguins' six-game unbeaten streak came to an end. (AP) Flyers 8, Capitals 2: Kevin Dineen broke out of a slump with three goals as Philadelphia crushed visiting Washington. Philadelphia, which has just one loss in its last five games (3-1-1), recorded its 999th franchise victory. Washington, which had been unbeaten in its last four games (2-0-2), suffered its first loss against a Patrick Division opponent in its last eight games (6-1-1). Dineen notched the Flyers' first goal at 5:43 of the first period off a scramble in front. Dineen had just two goals in his previous 20 games and 2 points in his last eight contests. His hat trick last night leaves him with 11 goals for the season. (AP) Blues 3, Flames 2: Brendan Shanahan, suspended by the league earlier in the day for a stick-swinging incident, scored on a 15-foot slap shot with 2:02 left in overtime to give St. Louis the victory at home. Shanahan was suspended for six non-game days without pay for hitting Minnesota's Mike Craig in the face with his stick on Dec. 22. In last night's game, Shanahan took a pass from Nelson Emerson in the right circle and fired the puck past goalie Mike Vernon to give the Blues consecutive victories for the first time since Oct. 31. (AP) Oilers 3, Blackhawks 3: Steve Larmer's second goal of the game with 5:38 left in the third period earned host Chicago the tie. Larmer took a pass from Michel Goulet, who had circled the Oilers' net as goaltender Bill Ranford was shoved into the net, and jammed the puck over the goal line. It marked the 11th straight season that Larmer, playing in his 843rd straight game, has scored 25 goals. (AP) N.B.A.  Spurs Cast a Spell  Dale Ellis scored a season-high 33 points and David Robinson added 16 as the San Antonio Spurs won at home over the Utah Jazz, 109-99, the Spurs' third victory over the Jazz this season. San Antonio, in second place in the Midwest Division, pulled within four games of Utah. The Jazz's six-game winning streak was stopped. (AP) Trail Blazers 113, Rockets 91: Cliff Robinson scored 21 points and Portland took advantage of the Rockets' 19-point fourth quarter for a road victory in Houston. Portland won its third straight victory, and the Rockets lost their sixth game in a row. Portland didn't lead until it went on 19-8 run over the final 7:13 of the third quarter. Houston went scoreless for 2:40 during Portland's run. (AP) Hawks 100, Bucks 94: Stacey Augmon scored 20 points, including two key baskets to keep Atlanta comfortably ahead in the final minute, and Kevin Willis added 18 points and 14 rebounds as Atlanta won in Milwaukee to end a four-game losing streak. Frank Brickowski had 24 points and Eric Murdock 19 for the Bucks, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. (AP) Suns 111, Mavericks 107: The best team in the league had to rally to beat the worst. Phoenix (23-5) outscored Dallas (2-25) by 29-18 in the fourth quarter to avoid an embarrassing loss. \"It was tough to get up for a game like this,\" said Charles Barkley, who led the Suns with 32 points and 14 rebounds. Barkley received three stitches over his right eye after being hit by a Terry Davis elbow. (AP) TENNIS  O'Brien Upsets Krajicek  Alex O'Brien of the United States upset top-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-4, to advance to the quarterfinals of the South Australian Open yesterday in Adelaide, Australia. (AP) Edberg Overcomes Flu and Kafelnikov: Top-seeded Stefan Edberg overcame a nagging flu to defeat Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, 6-3, 6-4, in the second round of the Qatar Open in Doha. Third-seeded Boris Becker also moved into the quarterfinals with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 victory over a Frenchman, Stephane Simian.

His memorial piece -- revived by the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night -- was intended for Mstislav Rostropovich, who in 1968 ran into trouble with the Soviet authorities and was unable to travel to Edmonton, Alberta, to play the premiere. The central event, the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had happened earlier that year.   Mr. Morawetz's piece is a kind of oratorio without words in which cello solos and a stringless orchestra -- all winds, brass and percussion -- depict violent death and mourning and intermittently comment on it. The tone is pessimistic in a particularly 20th-century way. Tragedy equals catastrophe; mourning becomes hopelessness without redemption. Brass and timpani are by turns angry and ominous.

Mosquitoes and biting flies have been conquered with jungle-formula repellent, and one learns to live with the rest and get on with enjoying the sights and sounds of their domain.\n\nThe other hazards of this vast forest, known as the Peten, are either rare or comical. Coral snakes and deadly fer-de-lances are seldom seen along the trails, and big cats like the jaguar and its smaller cousin the ocelot have been hunted to near extinction. If irritated, the spider monkey's most common tactic is to hurl half-eaten fruit or urinate on passers-by, and the howler monkeys sound much more threatening than they are.

In contrast, an incident from Paul Taylor's \"Company B,\" a work choreographed in 1991 which his troupe performed this autumn at the City Center, looked back upon the closeted past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Washington;\nBuilding Anew At Foxhall Site","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/realestate/northeast-notebook-washington-building-anew-at-foxhall-site.html","abstract":"WORK has resumed on the fourth and final section of luxury homes carved out of the 25-acre estate of Nelson A.

Here, tourist shops and boutiques outnumber even churches. To find the perfect Venetian keepsake requires some serious looking beyond display windows jammed with handcrafted trinkets and baubles, leather and paper goods, antiques and glass objects of every description, jewels and costume jewelry and of course the ubiquitous mask. One marvels at the sheer number of these shops all seemingly selling the same things. But then a closer look reveals that they are not all alike, that here and there are shops selling their own fine stock, where talented Venetian artisans are preserving the jeweled world of Veronese and Titian. The trick is to find them. \n\nThe problem for the ardent shopper in search of a serious purchase is that there is no one street dedicated to shopping, with the possible exception of the Via Frezzeria near St. Mark's Square. At 1691 Via Frezzeria, for example, Mirella Spinella's boutique, called simply M Antichita (telephone 5235666), is one of the city's most elegant. A look through the large window reveals an amazing assortment of fine antique furniture, paintings and bibelots. A handsome 18th-century desk or an antique silver box provides the background for the luxurious hand-blocked velvet cloaks and cushions the owner designs. (Cushions sell for about $100 (prices calculated at 1,400 lire to the dollar); full-length fur-trimmed cloaks go up to $1,500. The exquisite jewelry fashioned by another young Venetian artisan, Monica Zecchi, completes the picture of Venetian opulence. The Zecchi pieces in the shop's window are not for low budgets: An antique gold pendant embellished by tourmalines, hanging from a heavy gold chain, is obviously a one-of-a-kind piece designed by a skilled craftsman. Zecchi's necklaces show an imaginative use of semiprecious stones such as garnets, rose quartz and lapis lazuli set in gold; they start at around $1,800. Made-to-order pieces combining rubies, sapphires or emeralds sell for as much as $11,000.

We may also hope that, before too long, Russia will emerge from its agonies and set itself on the road to a better future.

In the fertile cornfields of the Branford River flood plain, industrial complexes expanded and condominiums -- more than 3,000 of them -- usurped woods and meadows. Branford quickly became known as a development-oriented town, a mother lode of fast food and discount clothing, not a place where one would expect to be able to hike for hours in quiet forests or along grassy marshes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"10,000th AIDS Death Occurs In San Francisco Since 1981","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/us/10000th-aids-death-occurs-in-san-francisco-since-1981.html","abstract":"  Mayor Frank Jordan ordered flags on municipal buildings flown at half-staff on Friday and called for five minutes of silence at 9 A.M. to note this city's 10,000th recorded death from the AIDS epidemic.

Their work sowed the seeds for a radical transformation of painting, the meaning of which is still being explored by artists today. In COLLAGE, ASSEMBLAGE, AND THE FOUND OBJECT (Abrams, $85), Diane Waldman follows the unfolding of collage as both a medium and a process in art, from Cubism and Dada through the work of such different artists as Vladimir Tatlin, Richard Hamilton and David Wojnarowicz. The author, the deputy director and senior curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, notes how the distinctions between found object and painting have blurred, as in the work of Anselm Kiefer, who incorporates items such as lead, straw and clothes into grim, monumental works about human destiny and guilt. In a new twist on the found object, artists like Sherrie Levine incorporate reproductions of previous masterpieces into their own creations. Finally, Ms. Waldman proposes that the connections between art and life suggested by the first collagists have deepened, with artworks being treated not as sacred relics but as part of the mishmash of the ordinary world from which, as Duchamp suggested, it is possible not just to create art but also simply to \n\nsee \n\nit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/books/c-corrections-266493.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Dec. 13 with a review of \"Kurt Weill: Composer in a Divided World\" included an erroneous identification, from the book, for an actor in the 1943 production of \"One Touch of Venus.\" He was John Boles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"MORRISTOWN JOURNAL;\nCommunity Up in Arms Over Plan for New Jail","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/nyregion/morristown-journal-community-up-in-arms-over-plan-for-new-jail.html","abstract":"MORRISTOWN'S jail, built to hold 145 inmates, now averages 300.

All undergraduates must now take one course that examines a non-European culture, a second that addresses issues of race, religion and ethnicity in America and a third that explores issues of gender roles and relationships.   Left intact were existing requirements that students take at least one course each in the mathematical sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences; philosophical, social and religious thought; literature and the fine arts. Though the university had previously required students to take a course each in the social sciences and behavioral sciences, it combined these two categories into a single requirement.   \"Like the four basic food groups, to have a balanced intellectual diet you should have a dish from each of these,\" said Peter Duus, a history professor who headed the Undergraduate Studies Committee when it oversaw the curriculum changes.   In part, say faculty members, those changes came about as an acknowledgment of the diversity of Stanford's own student body. Of this year's 1,600 freshmen, 45 percent are Asian, black, Hispanic or American Indian. But in broader terms, the revisions reflect the university's changing view of how best to prepare students for the challenges of today's world.   \"Basic to the general education of an informed citizen of the nation there has to be an understanding of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of our society,\" said Albert Camarillo, a history professor and associate dean of undergraduate studies in the School of Arts and Sciences. \"That is the basic idea.\"   But unlike many colleges, Stanford does not require students to take the same set of courses. To satisfy the world culture requirement, for example, students can choose from among some 30 courses. One Stanford graduate might walk away with an understanding of Zen Buddhism, while another will have a grasp of the contemporary history of Iran.   \"You could probably find under any one area that students will take one of five or six courses,\" Professor Duus said. \"But if you look at a student's transcripts, the only course they will have in common is 'Culture, Ideas and Values.' \"   What is lost in the absence of a shared core of classes, said Carol Schneider, executive vice president of the American Association of Colleges in Washington, is discussion outside the classroom among faculty members and students of the ideas they would all be studying.

Sherzer's 10-5 score gave him a norm toward grandmaster rank.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Nets Hit Switch From Off To On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/sports/basketball-nets-hit-switch-from-off-to-on.html","abstract":"  On a night when their best shooter and leading scorer was in the locker room getting treatment for an injury, the Nets had their best shooting performance of the season and the most lopsided victory in their history.   The Nets (18-15) shot 59.6 percent from the field -- without Drazen Petrovic -- and outrebounded the Washington Bullets by 67-41 in a 124-79 victory at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.

Love's final putt was more significant than usual because a heavy storm is expected to hit the San Diego area Sunday morning and could cancel the final round. If less than half the field completes the round on Sunday, Love will be declared the winner.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Antje Buelte, Edward Dolido","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/style/weddings-antje-buelte-edward-dolido.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Horst E.
