As with the atrocities in Bosnia, sadly enough, extensive exposure invites emotional paralysis.    \"Ultimate Betrayal\" is based on a true story, although, in familiar television flimflammery, certain events and characters have been fictionalized. In May 1990, two adult sisters claiming severe childhood abuse sued their father in the Denver courts. The father, Edward J. Rodgers Jr., refused to appear in court. He was a former F.B.I. agent who had become a Colorado authority on child abuse. The sisters, supported by their two other sisters but angrily denounced by their two brothers, were awarded $2.3 million in compensation and the case led to a proposal for a Child Abuse Accountability Act to change statute-of-limitations rules. It is currently before the United States Congress.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940318","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/nyregion/c-corrections-502022.html","abstract":"  An article on Jan. 30 about the National Arts Club and a dispute among tenants at the club's building on Gramercy Park misidentified the club's founder.

But here is Mr. Godard in a strangely lyrical and contemplative mood. The film opens today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, with its title awkwardly translated on screen as \"Woe Is Me.\" A better alternative would be \"Alas for Me,\" which captures Mr. Godard's meditative tone.    Like his 1985 film, \"Hail Mary,\" this new work depicts the possible appearance of the divine in ordinary contemporary lives. But where \"Hail Mary\" outraged some Christians by reinventing one of their most sacred myths, here Mr. Godard plays it safe by reaching back to Greek mythology for his god figure.

It is no accident, to use a locution often heard in Communist times, that those dismissed included Hungary's most popular and independent broadcasters. Though the post-Marxist regime pretends to denounce the old autocratic ways, its moves against the press are indistinguishable in principle from those under Communism.    Heading the list of those dismissed are the presidents of Hungarian Television and Hungarian Radio, who were appointed in 1990 with the agreement of all major parties to put the state-owned system under an autonomous corporation, along the lines of Britain's BBC. New guidelines were instituted to assure independence, vastly annoying the Government, which assumed it would get the same favored treatment as its Communist predecessors.

The amendment is bad economics, but it will keep coming back until we debunk the economic myths perpetuated by the debate.   Foremost, we need to understand what the national debt is and is not. It is not something we owe to other countries; it is a debt of the Government to its own people. Abraham Lincoln had it right in his 1864 annual message to congress: \"Held as it is for the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private, property. . . .

His instinct is correct: Welfare recipients who can work should. Workfare -- tying work to welfare -- holds out the promise of producing cleaner sidewalks and safer streets cheaply. Work could also be uplifting for the poor who can't find private jobs.   But the idea of workfare has been around for as long as welfare itself. Indeed, home relief recipients are already required to look for work. But history shows that putting workfare into practice is harder than it sounds. Most of the 220,000 home relief recipients are not physically or emotionally capable of useful work. Those who are need training, transportation, child care and, above all, close supervision. A program that appears nearly without cost quickly turns expensive, which is why local governments that start workfare often slip back into simply mailing welfare checks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940319","headline":"Review/Film Festival; A Poet Tries to Live as an Informer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/movies/review-film-festival-a-poet-tries-to-live-as-an-informer.html","abstract":"  It's easy to say that the personal and political cannot be separated, especially when describing Eastern Europe during the cold war years. \"Betrayal\" gives that glib idea a sympathetic human shape. This is the story of a poet who insists he will never sell his soul to Government agents, then desperately tries to survive by selling off a tiny portion of it. \"Betrayal,\" directed by Radu Mihaileanu, a Romanian writer and film maker now living in Paris, is to be shown today at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 3:15 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the New Directors/New Films series. The film is an absorbing, intellectually forceful and emotionally wrenching account of a poet's bargain with the Devil.   Though the film is set in Romania, it has less to do with the particulars of that country's politics than with the way individuals deal with repressive states. A brief prologue, set in the late 1940's, shows the poet, George Vlaicu, writing an anti-Stalin editorial that lands him in prison. Eleven years later he is still in an isolated cell, hardly able to shape his fingers around a pencil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940319","headline":"Broncos Sign Miller to Offer Sheet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/sports/sports-people-football-broncos-sign-miller-to-offer-sheet.html","abstract":"  The Denver Broncos signed ANTHONY MILLER, a four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver from the San Diego Chargers, to a contract offer sheet.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940319","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/nyregion/c-corrections-513059.html","abstract":"  A brief report in Business Day yesterday about a takeover bid for America West Airlines misstated part of the terms of a revised offer in some editions.

(Berlin has three.) In all those cities, in one way or another, the second company must constantly struggle to define its role. The big company does the big operas, meaning not only Wagner and Strauss but also the smaller core-repertory staples: Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, maybe even Janacek and Berg. That leaves operettas and musicals, ballets, lighter operas, modern operas, marginal operas, perhaps also mainstream operas, perhaps friskier productions, often opera in the language of the audience.   In recent years, no secondary opera company has struggled more with such questions of identity, and made more U-turns in its search for a direction, than the Volksoper in Vienna. The city has a powerful operetta tradition, and the Volksoper in recent decades has been its primary preserver. But it has done American musicals, too, and all manner of more or less successful experiments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940319","headline":"Church's Servants Had Loyal Following","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/19/nyregion/church-s-servants-had-loyal-following.html","abstract":"  The Rev.

For more than half a century they've been staring into nothingness and finding a beautiful nothing.\" In JAMES JOYCE: Reflections of Ireland (Macmillan, $35), the Irish literary critic Bernard McCabe expertly combines excerpts from Joyce's books with images from the British photographer Alain Le Garsmeur to convey that \"beautiful nothing,\" the special blend of the real and the imaginary that was characteristic of the Joycean universe. Mr. Le Garsmeur's images -- at once remote yet immediate -- evoke the paralysis of the lives portrayed in \"Dubliners,\" the quiet irony that makes the characters so sympathetic in \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" and so oddly heroic in their ordinariness in \"Ulysses\" and \"Finnegans Wake.\" The Bog of Allen, through Mr. Le Garsmeur's lens, is a barren, wind-swept expanse of loneliness -- the burial place of Michael Bodkin, the model for Michael Furey in \"The Dead\" and the inspiration for the beautiful poem \"She Weeps Over Rahoon.\" Fittingly, Mr. McCabe reprints both the poem and the ending of \"The Dead,\" Joyce's greatest short story. In the combination of the text and two photographs of the bog -- a wide-angled image of beach and sky, and a close-up shot of broken bits of seashells and sand -- Mr. McCabe and Mr. Le Garsmeur fix the meaning of Stephen Dedalus's question in \"Ulysses\": \"Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\" The juxtaposition suggests the Joycean insight that the simplest occurrence has cosmic implications. \nJOELLE ZOIS","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"No Sentiment Please, I'm British","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/books/no-sentiment-please-i-m-british.html","abstract":"  THE WATERS OF THIRST By Adam Mars-Jones. 184 pp. New York: Alfred A.

After years of making our own arrangements on bicycle vacations, Michael and I opted last autumn to let someone else cope with the logistics of hotels, food, supplies and the inevitable small inconveniences of travel. We also looked forward to the companionship of riding with new people, and the security of a \"sag wagon,\" a van ready to pick us up if we tired or simply got bored on the road. We signed up with Backroads, a Berkeley, Calif., company that has been doing tours like this since 1979. They offered three days of riding between Cedar Breaks National Monument and Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, alternating with two days of hiking among Bryce's sandstone hoodoos and Zion's monoliths. At $150 a person a day, it was a Rolls-Royce trip for us. On alternate days we rode or hiked as much as we wanted, carrying minimal gear. Everything else was Backroads's problem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"The Perils of Bureaucracy When Helping the Elderly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/nyregion/l-the-perils-of-bureaucracy-when-helping-the-elderly-554960.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The \"Eldercare\" article was an informative treatment of an important issue.

In the basement of a contemporary house in Albertson, Varinder Bhalla and his wife, Ratna, turn their attention not to the good life on the North Shore, but to a battle against the hunger of people who live half a world away.\n\n\"After you have a house, education and a nice family, you should devote yourself to something bigger than yourself, give something back,\" Mr. Bhalla said. \"If we keep choosing materialistic things in life there is no end to it. We have better inner feelings from what we are doing than from putting a million dollars in our bank account. With 40,000 children in the world dying of hunger and malnutrition every day I am willing to give my own life for this.\"\n\nThe Bhallas have established the AWB Food Bank in New Delhi. It is the first organization that collects and redistributes surplus food in India. The charity takes its name from the initials of Mr. Bhalla's late mother. The Bhallas say they have invested more than $50,000 in the organization.\n\nThe food bank has operated since November 1992. It began by providing 50 meals a day. Now, according to Mr. Bhalla, 2,000 are distributed. By Jan. 23, 1994, their ledger shows, the food bank had served 624,033 meals, or more than four tons of food, by Mr. Bhalla's reckoning. \n\nAll the five-star hotels in New Delhi as well as several four- and three-star hotels, caterers and an airline participate, contributing surpluses at the end of each day. The food bank provides the businesses with refrigerated stainless-steel enclosures to store the food. \"Surplus\" food is food prepared in excess of needs, not that which has been left on plates or at tables. \n\nThe Bhallas view it as perfectly logical that people who suffered from a lack of food can enjoy gourmet meals. \n6 Staff Members in India\n\n AWB picks up the food daily in its vans and distributes it to 12 charitable organizations, principally schools and institutions for blind, handicapped and poor children and a lepers' center.\n\nThe food bank is operated solely by volunteers and a paid staff of six in India, as well as the Bhallas, working out of their basement on Long Island. Mr. Bhalla has made six trips to India at his own expense on behalf of AWB in the last two years.\n\nAlthough he has been self-employed for 20 years, Mr. Bhalla has never lost the habit of donning shirt and tie during working hours, although his office is in his house. His enthusiasm and energy make him seem larger than his actual dimensions as well as years younger than his true age of 47.\n\nHis grows radiant at details like hearing his name pronounced correctly. He is charming and articulate, and thorough to a fault. Mr. Bhalla should not be asked a question unless the questioner has the leisure to absorb a complete answer. \n\nIn introducing his wife Mr. Bhalla said Ratna meant gem in Hindi. \"Isn't she a gem?\" he asked. She smiled. Mrs. Bhalla, whose gleaming dark hair reaches halfway to her waist, wore a red silk salwar kameez, traditional Indian flowing trousers covered by an overblouse and a long chunni, or stole. She served tea flavored with cardamom in the conference room of their deceptively vast suite of offices. \n\nAlthough her husband did most of the talking, Mrs. Bhalla proved equally articulate and persuasive when speaking. \"We have thought and acted together since the food bank's conception,\" Mrs. Bhalla said. \"Each idea that comes up we discuss together.\"\n\n\"There's almost nothing I would do without her 100 percent concurrence, involvement and support,\" Mr. Bhalla agreed. Mrs. Bhalla recounted how one night her husband, unable to sleep because he was thinking about a fund-raising event, awoke her at 2:30 A.M. to discuss it. She professed not to have minded, saying her pregnancy -- she expects their third child in May -- frequently awakened her at that hour, anyway. \n\nMr. Bhalla took pains to state that although his organizational titles were chairman and president and his wife's was general secretary they were co-founders and equals. Their positions are voluntary, as are all board positions. No one collects a salary, except for the workers in India who drive the vans and collect and distribute food. \n\nMr. Bhalla, who was born and raised in Amritsar, Punjab, said his mother provided much of the inspiration for the food bank. His memory is full of her kindness to others, particularly in feeding those less fortunate than her family. Mr. Bhalla and his six brothers and sisters distributed food to as many as 300 people every month, he said, adding: \n\n\"It was part of our family togetherness. Feeding the hungry is a strong part of our culture.\"\n\nMr. Bhalla said the idea for the food bank originated with his desire to provide a bandara, a charitable meal traditionally offered to the poor to honor an ancestor's memory or a holiday, on the anniversary of his mother's death. It had been her dying wish, he added.\n\nAbout the same time he saw a report on television about food banks in the United States that set off such a spark that he began researching the sources named in the program to learn how they operated. \"The more we saw the more we decided to pursue this,\" he said.\n\nHe spent a month in India showing videotapes of American food banks to the managers of all the five-star hotels in New Delhi, hoping to enlist their help. Four months later, their pledges of support in hand, Mr. Bhalla returned to the capital, bought a van, and spent weeks hiring and training a staff, and driving the van to collection and delivery points himself.\n\nToday, with two successful charity events behind them and armed with a professionally produced promotional video, fliers, newsletters and a file of clippings from Indian and Indian-American publications, the Bhallas are a force to be reckoned with. \n\n\"The goals that we set for ourselves are so powerful that nobody can say he can't support it,\" Mr. Bhalla said. Although he said he had no political connections when he started, he now has endorsements from a host of diplomats and politicians. A former president of India, Zail Singh, and a member of India's Parliament, Sunil Dutt, appear on the organization's letterhead as patrons. \n\nMr. Bhalla came from an upper-middle-class family. After graduating with his B.S. in mechanical engineering he earned a master's in mechanical engineering at Washington State University with the help of scholarship in 1971. \n\n\"I was always very ambitious about coming here,\" Mr. Bhalla said.  \"I was fascinated by how progressive this country is. The landing of the man on the Moon really put the fire in my belly.\" \n\nWhen he graduated he found himself thrust into a poor job market in the Northwest, after Boeing had laid off thousands of engineers in the Seattle region. \"Imagine a person with dark skin, an accent and no experience competing against thousands of others with experience,\" Mr. Bhalla said. \n\nHe eventually landed an interview with the chief engineer of a firm in Spokane. After driving 100 miles to the interview Mr. Bhalla was told that the man he had traveled to see was in meetings and was kept waiting for hours. When closing time arrived, Mr. Bhalla convinced them that he would not leave until he was seen. \n\nHe finally sat down with the interviewer, who told him he could not hire him because he lacked experience. Mr. Bhalla remembers hearing himself say, \"If every college graduate had to have experience no engineer would ever get a job, including you.\" \n\n\"I don't know how I got so bold as to say that,\" he said in retrospect. He was offered the position. \"I was the first person in my class to get a job,\" he recalled.\n\nHis persistence and foresight saw him through a successful career in nuclear energy in that industry's strongest period of growth. He became a private consultant, with more than 200 engineers working for him at the peak of his business in 1986. When the nuclear industry declined the next year the Bhallas started a business recruiting and training foreign health professionals for American hospitals.\n\nThey own their house, Mr. Bhalla said, and their sons attend public school. They, too, have received the message that with money comes social responsibility. Their parents say the sons freely donate part of their allowances to the food bank each month.\n\n\"The American people are the most charitable in the world,\" Mr. Bhalla said. \"That is why America is such a blessed country. Anywhere in the world there is a disaster the Americans get there first.\n\n\"We need to be part of mainstream America. We have to share the responsibility of this society. If there are problems of hunger that is the most important problem of all, worse than lack of education. It relates to basic human survival on an immediate basis.\n\n\"What troubles me most is that society, in the world as a whole, has the resources to end hunger all over the world but doesn't have the will to do so.\"\nAssistance for Other Organizations\n\n A more personal motivation is to help combat negative stereotypes about Indians. The Bhallas cited recent bias attacks on Indians in Jersey City by youths calling themselves \"dotbusters,\" referring to the bindi, or ornamental dot, that many Indian women wear on their foreheads.

If you're among those millions of listeners who became familiar with Ms. Raitt's artful synthesis of rock, blues and folk primarily from her two most recent releases, the commercial breakthrough of \"Nick of Time\" (1989) and the quintuple-platinum \"Luck of the Draw\" (1991), you may not be prepared for the depth of emotion that the new album draws upon. In some ways, this collection might have been called \"Raitt's Revenge\": After establishing a new peak of popularity, Ms. Raitt, 44, has returned with the sort of soulful, brooding album that used to consign her to mere cult status.   To be sure, \"Longing in Their Hearts\" (Capitol C1 0777 81427 1 7; CD and cassette) isn't by any means a dour endurance test.  The album commences with the snappy \"Love Sneakin' Up on You,\" a bit of whipcrack blues-rock so vivid you can practically see Ms. Raitt's eyes glint wickedly as she unfurls sinuous slide-guitar riffs and sings in a low, lusty growl. It is followed by the title song, co-written by Ms. Raitt and her husband, the actor Michael O'Keefe. The pair -- whose first recorded collaboration, \"One Part Be My Lover,\" was a high point of \"Luck of the Draw\"-- has come up with another wry winner, the gently doleful tale of a short-order cook with a troubled marriage and a longing in his heart for a better, more romantic life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"In the Region/Long Island;\nScore One for the Assessors, One for Homeowners","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/realestate/in-the-regionlong-island-score-one-for-the-assessors-one-for.html","abstract":"LAST Jan. 31, a Hauppauge condominium won a victory over a town assessor.

At issue is a golf course slated to take up close to a third of the park.   The development corporation has engaged a designer to plan the use of 152 acres of parkland for a golf course, restaurant, parking space with peripheral space of 75 acres for playgrounds, picnic areas, jogging paths, parking space and gardens, accounting for about one-third of the park. The cost of the golf course will be met by issuing however many millions of dollars seem necessary worth of tax-exempt New Jersey bonds. The facilities on the 75 acres set aside for public enjoyment are to be funded, according to an advertisement run by the corporation, by income from the golf course.   No one disputes the need for more playgrounds or picnic areas. The one playground built in the 10 years since the park opened is sufficient for possibly 20 children. There are so few tables and benches that families hunker down along the drive leading into the park with grills and picnic baskets.   No one disputes the appeal of a golf course within easy ride of Hudson County or the attractiveness of the sport. Speakers and letter writers have suggested other spots where a golf course would be a benefit.   Over a year ago the Friends of Liberty State Park presented an alternative park design to the corporation, but it has been largely ignored.   In spite of opposition, the corporation refuses to budge. The final decision is with the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy but, so far as the public is aware, the corporation is in charge.   Millions of dollars in tax-exempt bonds will be issued, with interest met and final payment made from the income of the course's green fees, restaurant, pro shop and parking lot. From this income will also come payment on park improvements. But wouldn't a far smaller bond issue pay for playground equipment, picnic tables and benches, clearing pathways and planting gardens?   Should the golf course default, taxpayers would end up paying for it.   The fight is not over yet. A coalition to save Liberty State Park proposes a plan for the park based on New York's Central park and for the dismantling of the development corporation. The coalition, an umbrella organization of citizen groups statewide, hopes to persuade state officials that a golf course in Liberty State Park is not a good idea.

Cochran of the law firm of Wilson, Smith, Cochran & Dickerson in Seattle described why she thought there were no \"evil forces at work\" when often refuse to pay for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone-marrow transplants in breast-cancer cases.   \"Skeptics argue that treatment for desperately ill women should not await the rigors of scientific scrutiny, as these women do not have the time to wait for science to prove the treatment. Much the same would have been said by women who received radical mastectomies at the hands of enthusiastic surgeons convinced that this was the 'only cure' for their breast cancer. Unfortunately science later proved this to be untrue in many cases.\"    Ms. Cochran said it was paradoxical that customers should criticize insurers for failing to reimburse a treatment that, some companies say, has not proved to be superior.   Another lawyer, L. Susan Slavin of Slavin & Steinberg, said that in most cases insurers cited contractual agreements that really did not limit the procedure, because it is merely an extension of high-dose chemotherapy, which is usually covered.    \"It's just a matter of dollars and cents,\" Ms. Slavin said. \"It's an expensive procedure, and every time they say no to it they save $150,000.\"    On Long Island, where the incidence of breast cancer is higher than the statewide average, the battle is frequently played out. Those women with advanced breast cancer who have been told by their physicians that they have no treatment options other than transplants and whose insurers have refused to pay for the procedure are being encouraged by advocacy groups to take further action.   Insurance companies are fighting back. Liz LoRusso, executive director of one local advocacy group, 1 in 9, said the cases of 11 women seeking reimbursements had gone to litigation and been settled in favor of the patients. Many other battles have been fought over the telephone and through the mail, she added.    \"Two to three years ago there were no attorneys trained to help us fight,\" Ms. LoRusso said. \"Now there are. Women with breast cancer are viewed as very weak. Well, we're the strongest people you'll ever find, because we're fighting for our lives. We'll leave no stone unturned.\"    Arlene Pokorny, 47, of Melville, was given a diagnosis of breast cancer in 1979 and is now fighting her third recurrence. At her physician's urging, she requested clearance from her insurance carrier to pay for transplants.   \"I've never been denied anything,\" Ms. Pokorny said. \"Now my life is hanging on a thread. I'm living in terror all the time that they'll say no.\"    She added that she had hired a lawyer \"just in case I'll need one.\"    After weeks of legal proceedings her insurance company agreed to cover her transplant.  Role of Bar Associations    The chief of psychiatry service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, Dr. Jimmie Holland, said: \"I think this adds to the already high sense of vulnerability and uncertainty that women already feel about the disease. It's kind of a betrayal. Anxiety and depression are already felt by women with breast cancer. The need for this kind of fight just compounds it.\"    Ms. Slavin said she worried about \"how many women out there who, when they know their insurance company won't pay for their treatment, just walk away from the fight.\"   To assist women who have been denied reimbursements for transplants or other procedures or who face other obstacles from their carriers the Nassau and Suffolk Bar Associations will soon distribute brochures to breast-cancer coalitions, doctors' offices, hospitals and clinics announcing their free law program, said Tom Maligno, executive director of the associations. \"It's a chance to reach the clients who need us most and a unique opportunity for the health and legal professions to work together,\" he said.    What remains to be seen, however, is whether legal help will settle differences between carriers and clients. Many insurers say they are prepared to change their contracts and claims reviews to avoid being responsible for procedures like transplants.   Kathy Olson, a spokeswoman for Mutual of Omaha, which insures more than 10 million individual and group policyholders, said there was no way that Mutual could have anticipated the surge in technology. As a result, she said, Mutual will try to clarify its new policies to avoid disputes.   Insurers usually wait for a procedure to be accepted by medical experts before they extend coverage to it. \"In the future,\" Ms. Olson said, \"we'll use the percent-success rate of a treatment to measure the success of it, so that there's a clearer understanding of what is experimental.\"    The associate general counsel of the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association of Chicago, Mary Ader, said: \"We're working for the benefit of the subscribers. Our desire is to cure our patients. We don't want them languishing in hospitals. We want them to live, and live a healthy life.\"  'Sympathy and Concern'    The associate director of the cancer-therapy-evaluation program at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Michael A. Friedman, said that he had \"enormous sympathy and concern\" for people who wanted to optimize their chances of living, but that he was not sure that the relentless pressure that patients and their doctors and lawyers put on insurers was in the patients' best interest.   \"Look, this is not a story that lends itself to simple truths,\" he said. \"In certain selected situations bone-marrow transplants can be very efficacious. But there are many unanswered questions.\"    Dr. Friedman cautions patients about being too optimistic about the possibilities of transplants and suggests that they wait for the results of four trials that are under way. The tests are intended to compare the benefits and risks of the procedure to conventional chemotherapy for treating localized breast cancer at high risk of recurrence and metastatic breast cancer.   \"Patients should opt for a treatment that's indisputable, one that's ethically and scientifically correct,\" he said.    From the point of view of many physicians, the criticism of using transplants outside clinical trials for their patients is unfounded. The physician in charge of the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Dr. Michael Schuster, said:    \"The problem is that treatments for all cancers might be viewed as experimental, in the sense that they're constantly evolving, constantly moving forward. The only way we can move forward is to introduce new treatments in the hope that we can cure a larger percentage of patients.   \"If third-party payers slam the door on new treatments by using the 'E' word, then no progress will be made. We'd be using the same kind of medicine that we did five years ago.\"   Health-care economists say physicians are part of the problem in the equation that divides the insured from insurance companies. Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said:   \"On the one hand, physicians tell you they were trained in school to fight for their patients and do their best. But they were not trained as guardians of the U.S. Treasury. If there's any hope that something will work, then they are morally obliged to do it.   \"On the other hand, you can't run a health system on that algorithm. You have to allow nonphysicians further upstream to actually make the hard calls and not give away the Gross National Product.\"    Professor Reinhardt suggested that a dispassionate panel of experts intervene when a doctor proposes to treat a patient with a controversial therapy. Many insurance companies have begun to do that, and more say they will follow that route. Use of Independent Panel    The director of technology assessment and policy for Aetna Health Plans in Hartford, William McGivney, said that in the 20-month period that Aetna has used an independent panel to help it decide financing in more than 100 decisions, one case against it has gone to court.   \"We've extended ourselves to meet the needs of our patients,\" Mr. McGivney said. \"If we've got three experts who are saying no to a treatment then we're pretty sure it's not appropriate care for a patient.\"   Aetna, Prudential and Travelers subscribe to the Medical Care Ombudsman Program in Washington. The director of the program, Grace Powers Monaco, said it promised to provide fast authoritative reviews of treatments. The program will work with a patient and insurer to resolve any issues \"in a sensitive and personal matter,\" she said.   \"I think grown-ups have to be grow up about their medical care,\" Ms. Monaco, a lawyer, said. \"They don't want to waste their money and resources on a procedure that can't really provide them with an increased amount of life. I think, unfortunately, we've made a big mistake in this country that we've not educated our children, young people and adults about how to evaluate their medical care options. If you see something like H.D.C./A.B.M.T. depicted in the media as a treatment for one thing you might not understand that it only works in a patient that looks, tastes and smells a certain way. It may not be for you.\"  Votes of Confidence    Some lawyers say they feel confident about the future. Louis J. Castellano Jr., who successfully represented Joseph Scalamandre in a suit in Federal District Court in Uniondale, said the value in overturning a denial of coverage by Oxford Health Plans Inc. for a transplant for Mr. Scalamandre's wife was that \"carriers now notice there was a case tried to conclusion, and the determination was made against the carrier.\"    That was just one more case that seems to add to \"the majority rule in the United States that this treatment is not experimental in most jurisdictions,\" Mr. Castellano said.    Ms. Ader of Blue Cross-Blue Shield disagreed, saying: \"The effect of judicial opinion, as defined by law, is that there's precedent only in jurisdictional issues. Such opinions have no value outside of that jurisdiction. The courts are not required to follow it elsewhere. It is not binding.\"   In one of the largest challenges to the denial of \"investigational chemotherapy,\" Memorial Sloan-Kettering, in a complaint filed in State Supreme Court, maintains that Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield should be ordered to pay $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages for refusing to cover transplants for cancer patients.   Who will ultimately have the power to make health decisions is certainly going to be a \"major issue for the women here,' said Patricia Spicer of Cancer Care in Woodbury, a clinical coordinator for breast-cancer services on Long Island. \"This issue has already been coming up more often in our groups, because more doctors are recommending H.D.C./A.B.M.T. early on.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"Objects and Objets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/style/evening-hours-objects-and-objets.html","abstract":"  Exhibitions of artworks by Emma Amos and from the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, New York, March 11 and 12.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"On the Amazing Reproduction of Pictures","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/books/on-the-amazing-reproduction-of-pictures.html","abstract":"THE RENAISSANCE PRINT\n1470-1550.\nBy David Landau and Peter Parshall.\nIllustrated. 433 pp. New Haven:\nYale University Press. $65.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"They're Dancing as Fast as They Can","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/theater/sunday-view-they-re-dancing-as-fast-as-they-can.html","abstract":"  IF YOU'RE IN A MOOD TO CONSIDER alternative theater, you couldn't do much better than to check out \"Marathon Dancing,\" the vivid new site-specific performance piece now being presented by En Garde Arts at the Masonic Hall at 71 West 23d Street.

A role as the heavy in a film can revive a flagging career (though that can backfire) or change a specialized image (though some actors, like Alan Alda, can't shake a nice-guy tag no matter what they do).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"The Improbable Career of Horace Pippin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/arts/art-view-the-improbable-career-of-horace-pippin.html","abstract":"  WHAT WERE THE prospects during the 1930's for a middle-aged black man from West Chester, Pa., who earned his living as a handyman and had never studied art, to make it as a big-time painter? Dim to none. But Horace Pippin, the subject of a big retrospective here at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, had one of the most improbable careers in the history of 20th-century American art.   Born into a family one generation removed from slavery, he worked as a hotel porter, iron molder and used-clothes peddler before joining the Army in 1917 at the age of 29. While fighting with the heralded all-black 369th Infantry Regiment in France, he was shot by a sniper and lost the ability to raise his right arm. He returned, with a Croix de Guerre, to the United States and took odd jobs to supplement his disability pension.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"This Yank Prefers To Show, Not Tell","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/sports/baseball-this-yank-prefers-to-show-not-tell.html","abstract":"  The lessons about life that would affect Bernie Williams forever began in Vegalta, Puerto Rico, when he was old enough to listen, understand and then act.

In this novel, a writer who just happens to be named Philip Roth and who is recovering from a breakdown discovers that another man is impersonating him quite successfully in Israel. His confrontation with his doppelganger forms the substance of the plot, which involves both men in Israeli politics and a debate over the future of the Jews. Last year our reviewer, D. M.

One feels that Mr. Roth feels that he's let rip.\" Vintage has also reissued two of the author's earlier books, both with autobiographical elements.

One of those respects is the vastly different way in which our two societies react to events on the cultural edge between them, like the debate over the proper response to the vicious remarks of Khalid Abdul Muhammad, the Nation of Islam spokesman, at Kean College and elsewhere.    Simply put, black people and white people of good conscience -- even those with equal levels of education and wealth -- see events very differently. This was true during the trial of the youths accused of the assault and rape of a jogger in Central Park in 1989, during the recent controversy over the preservation of the African Burial Ground in lower Manhattan, and in the aftermath of the 1991 Crown Heights riots. And it is starkly true in the current debate over the Nation of Islam's failure to respond adequately to Mr. Muhammad's speech.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940320","headline":"Grange Vote: Move It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/20/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-grange-vote-move-it.html","abstract":"  The proposed move and restoration of the Hamilton Grange won a critical endorsement on Thursday when Community Board 9 voted 18 to 11 in favor.

Next door to Park & Orchard, the brothers' well-known, hangar-sized restaurant with a natural foods theme, this unlikely offshoot seats only 34 diners and specializes in comfort foods with an emphasis on red meat.\n\nPot roast, meatloaf and roasted chicken -- all in oversized portions and accompanied by a buttery mound of mashed potatoes -- are typical of the hearty main courses. Desserts include banana cream pie, an icebox cake of chocolate wafers and whipped cream, and a pudding of the day like tapioca, rice or butterscotch.\n\nBuddy Gebhardt said that the restaurant was named Ethel after their mother, and that the concept was inspired by memories of Sunday dinners that she and other relatives prepared during their childhood in northern New Jersey. Keeping it in the family, the chef is Lenny Maiorano, a brother-in-law who has cooked at Park & Orchard for the last five years.\n\nConstruction glitches delayed the opening, Mr. Gebhardt said, from the planned November date until March 2. The opening coincided with the region's 15th winter storm, Mr. Maiorano said, and only 13 customers showed up.\n\nThe restaurant, which is in part of a brick building that formerly housed a nuts and bolts factory, is decorated in a 50's period look with floral print draperies, yellow and green marble tile floor and striped banquettes. \n\nMain courses are $16.95 to $21.95, including vegetables and a salad platter. There is no liquor license; diners bring their own wine. Wine can also be bought at Park & Orchard, which has one of the state's premier cellars, and brought over. The restaurant is open Wednesday through Sunday from 5 to 10 P.M.\n\nEthel's Sunday Dinner, 246 Hackensack Street, East Rutherford. (201) 896-1333.\nIrish Specialties\n\n The crush of St. Patrick's Day is past, but many Irish-Americans and kindred spirits continue to head to the Harp 'n' Bard, a snug Irish pub and restaurant in Clifton. With entertainment several nights a week by the likes of Kevin McArdle and his band or Mike Byrne and the Green Derby Boys, many customers sing along or do a turn on the pocket-sized dance floor.\n\nBeers on draft include Guinness Stout, Harp, John Courage and Newcastle Brown Ale and sold by the pint and half pint. The kitchen offers simple fare like hamburgers and even veal parmigiana, but the better bets are the traditional Irish dishes.\n\nShepherd's pie, ground lamb and peas in gravy baked under a cap of mashed potatoes; fish in a thick batter with chips (french fries) and malt vinegar, and a mixed grill of slightly charred pork chop, Irish bacon, imported sausages and black and white puddings with a grilled tomato are typical.\n\nThese entrees are $8.95 to $10.95. The price includes either a ho-hum iceberg lettuce salad or a creamy and fortifying potato soup speckled with bacon bits. To finish, whisky-laced Irish coffee with whipped cream beats the desserts.\n\nThere's a dart board in a corner of the bar, and old wooden booths separated by lace cafe curtains ring the dining area. Some of the staff speak with an Irish lilt and remain cordial despite the crush.\n\nThe pub is open for lunch Tuesday through Friday and for dinner every day. Live entertainment is offered Friday through Sunday.\n\nNext door, at the Harp and Shamrock, a gift shop under the same ownership, Irish food specialties are also available.\n\nHarp 'n' Bard, 363 Lakeview Avenue, Clifton. (201) 772-7282.\nDinners With Themes\n\n The Fresh Fields Cafe, a trim and easygoing storefront restaurant in a Chatham shopping center, is now offering a choice of seven prix fixe meals in addition to its regular menu of contemporary American fare. The three-course dinners, with themes like Marseilles, Milan and low calorie, range from $24 to $26 and should appeal to value-conscious diners.\n\nThe chef-owner, Kevin Collins, and his sous-chef, Thomas Arrasate, work out of a closet-sized kitchen in view of the diners and specialize in eclectic dishes accompanied by a signature garden patch of vegetables.\n\nThe Milan dinner includes grilled eggplant and pepper salad in balsamic vinaigrette, risotto with Gorgonzola and a choice of homemade dessert. Marseilles includes mussels in saffron sauce, salmon fillet in lemon and herb sauce and dessert. A typical low-calorie menu comprises Fresh Fields salad (mixed greens, alfalfa sprouts and fruit), a grilled fish of the day with lemon and herb sauce, and a fruit plate. \n\nAs for the health-conscious fare, Mr. Collins says he offers the low- calorie meals because so many people talk about their health problems and special diets. \"But,\" he said, \"to be honest with you, we only sell about five low-cal dinners a week. You'd think everybody would jump on it, but they don't.\" \n\nThe Morris County restaurant, which is convenient for pretheater dining before performances at Drew University, does not have a liquor license. It is open for lunch Tuesday through Friday from noon to 2 P.M. and for dinner, Tuesday through Saturday from 5:30 to 10 P.M. and Sunday from 4 to 9 P.M. \n\nFresh Fields Cafe, Hickory Square Shopping Center, 641 Shunpike Road, Chatham.
