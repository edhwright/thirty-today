The museum has also acknowledged what has been rumored for years: that it is actively searching for a secondary exhibition space away from its West 53d Street site. Officials at the Modern said they had a space in mind but would not identify it or offer any specifics about its location except to say that it is not far from the museum.    \"We're trying to keep the momentum up,\" Agnes Gund, the president of the museum, said in an interview at the museum shortly after the giant Matisse retrospective, which attracted 900,000 admissions and filled the museum's main galleries for four and a half months. \"But even though Matisse was a great success, we're no different from every other museum.

Leetch, who won the Norris Trophy last season as the National Hockey League's best defenseman, hasn't played since Dec. 17 because of a nerve injury in his neck and left shoulder.

The bridge equivalent, less lethal, concerns a man who is trying to make a slam when missing two aces. If he is playing for a very high stake, he can be expected to make a desperate effort to turn disaster into triumph.   The diagramed example was played in a rubber bridge game at TGR's Club in London, and the South player was Irving Rose, one of the world's most brilliant card players. After finding a spade fit his partner took a wild shot at six spades, thinking that his partner was likely to have an ace in a red suit. This is admittedly a difficult bidding situation, since Blackwood is of little value when holding a void suit. In experienced partnerships North's second bid should be a jump to four clubs, which is a splinter bid even though partner has bid the suit. North should then accept a sign-off in four spades, since it is probable that the partnership is missing two red aces, or one red ace and the spade queen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930128","headline":"Beijing Shuffles Military to Avert Power Struggle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/world/beijing-shuffles-military-to-avert-power-struggle.html","abstract":"  The Communist Party has completed a military shuffle that may be the most comprehensive in four decades, apparently in part to avert power struggles that could erupt after the death of the 88-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping.
