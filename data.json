Having invested millions in front-office, coach's and players' salaries, and having emerged with their first legitimate chance to win a championship in 20 years, it is unfortunate for the Knicks that all is being risked by senseless belligerence. Forget for the moment the danger Anthony Mason, Greg Anthony and John Starks present to opponents and to the integrity of the sport.

With McCoy Tyner's 15-piece big band, the leader's splashy, thick-chorded approach to the piano translates to lush orchestrations in which every register is densely populated: tuba sharing bass lines with the bass, congas meshing rhythms with the trap drums, and brasses (including French horn along with trombones and trumpets) trading melodic sections with saxophones and woodwinds. Harmonies become chorales that use unexpectedly rich chromatic chords, and a prominent flute or piccolo often twitters up above.    The arrangements add detail to the music, but never at the expense of its drive. In Tuesday's second set at the Five Spot (4 West 31st Street, Manhattan), uptempo compositions by Mr. Tyner bustled along, especially \"Fly With the Wind,\" in which a modal vamp and a quasi-African polyrhythm emerged from a rumble of percussion to spur ensembles and solos, then melted into a percussion coda as if to say that rhythm was the music's wellspring.

Clouds of dust and other pulverized radioactive debris floated across the U.S., just as the atmospheric-test fallout clouds had, landing on wheat fields, reservoirs and cow pastures.

When President Clinton said he would consider a proposal to segregate homosexuals in the military, he entertained a foolish idea that would only foment the very hatreds it seeks to allay. The President's waffling was rightly denounced by partisans on both sides of the controversy over whether gay men and women should be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces.   It's understandable that Mr. Clinton would seek some way to escape the furor caused by his pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals. But segregation -- by isolating gay soldiers in specified jobs or units or separate living quarters -- is both impractical and discriminatory. The presumed value of such segregation is that it would reduce tensions between heterosexuals and homosexuals -- and relieve heterosexuals of the fear they might be viewed as sexual targets by members of their own sex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930327","headline":"We Should Act in Bosnia for Humanity's Sake","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/27/opinion/l-we-should-act-in-bosnia-for-humanity-s-sake-719993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"There's No Oil in Bosnia\" (Op-Ed, March 10), Dimitri Simes admonishes the United States not to get involved in Bosnia because it is of no geopolitical importance to us.

To top it all off, there was the gracious Jessye Norman, glittering and glowing from the stage as she sang the score for Michael Smuin's \"Songs of Mahler.\"   The Smuin work, set to music from \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" and \"Songs of a Wayfarer,\" is unusual in the Mahler ballet repertory. There are hints of the melancholy and fatalism that the composer seems to inspire in choreographers. But Mr. Smuin has created a playful, lyrically romantic romp that, drawing on the song texts for its moods, demands a high standard of academic dancing, unfailing clarity and a sensitivity to dramatic texture. The work also uses most of the company's stars and many of its most promising newer performers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930327","headline":"Ending Its Secrecy, White House Lists Health-Care Panel","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/27/us/ending-its-secrecy-white-house-lists-health-care-panel.html","abstract":"  After much criticism of the secrecy surrounding the work of his health policy team, President Clinton today abandoned his effort to conceal the names of more than 500 people who are developing his proposal to guarantee health insurance coverage for all Americans.

Second is the political fact that the Israeli Parliament voted 66 to 53 for this man who advocates bolder approaches to peace with the Arabs, including direct negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization. His choice can only bolster Israeli moderates amid a discouraging impasse in Middle East peace talks.
