As a traffic accident it wasn't bad, one of the superstitious coaches said, but as an omen it might be.   \"We will see tonight if it's bad luck,\" said Tamara Moskvina, who coaches the 1992 Olympic champions, Natalya Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev.   Even before the accident, Moskvina had her suspicions that Mishkutienok and Dmitriev would not repeat as gold medalists. Their gymnastic, innovative style has never seemed to impress judges as much as the lilting harmony and husband-and-wife artistry of Yekaterina Gordeyeva and Sergei Grinkov, the 1988 champions.   \"I think the inclination is not toward my couple,\" she said.   Moskvina was right. Gordeyeva and Grinkov strayed from perfection in tonight's long program, with the normally steady Grinkov struggling through two jumps. But the pair won a second Olympic title, receiving a perfect score of 6.0 from the Russian judge, and 5.9's from the other eight judges for artistic impression. Mishkutienok and Dmitriev won the silver. A Russian pair has now won the gold medal for the ninth straight Winter Olympics.   Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada won the bronze medal. Eisler later complained about a new rule that allowed professional skaters such as the gold and silver medalists to regain their amateur status for the Olympics.   \"I don't agree they should be back,\" Eisler said. \"Tonight, we're the gold medal winners.\"   \"I'm a skater; I skate,\" Dmitriev said.   Clearly, Dmitriev and Mishkutienok won the crowd's favor, as they had done in the short program on Sunday. They performed more difficult jumps and more creative spins, but, in the end, the competition distilled itself to a matter of style. And the judges, especially the American judge, Elaine DeMore, preferred the balletic unison and classic line and of Gordeyeva and Grinkov to the engaging inventiveness of Dmitriev and Mishkutienok.   \"The panel could have gone either way,\" said John Nicks, coach of the American pair, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa, Calif., who skated another consistent program and finished an encouraging fifth. \"The winning side made a couple of minor errors, but I think they won because of their general approach to skating. They are what I would call a purist's pair.\"   There was one scary moment in the competition, when Mandy Woetzel of Germany fell during a spiral maneuver and bounced hard off the ice with her chest and chin. She was carried from the rink by her partner, Ingo Steuer. Woetzel received three stitches in her chin, but did not suffer any broken ribs or require hospitalization. After a short pause, the competition resumed and headed toward the much-anticipated showdown between the gold medalists from the previous two Olympics. Newfound Maturity    Gordeyeva was only 16 and Grinkov was 21 when they won their first gold medal at Calgary in 1988. She is 22 now, the mother of a young daughter named Daria. Gordeyeva brings a newfound maturity to her skating, and she has become a more impressive jumper. She has a presence that forces all eyes on her, and Grinkov, her husband, has the self-assurance to restrain himself in a supporting role. When they are at their best, he is all but invisible.   Tonight, though, his minor faults kept intruding on their lilting routine, skated to Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata.\" Grinkov lost his balance on a double flip jump, and he reduced an intended double salchow to a single. Gordeyeva lurched forward while landing a throw double axel, but otherwise she was flawless. Their unison was never in more brilliant display than when they spun, side by side, fast, then slow, their bodies remaining in perfect unison.   Mishkutienok and Dmitriev are polar opposites to Gordeyeva and Grinkov. Dmitriev is built like a tight end, Mishkutienok is as much a gymnast as a skater. She grabbed her left leg and held it above her head on one spin, then inverted herself, her head at his skates, for another maneuver that has come to be known as the Natalya Death Spin.   They are full of emotion and expressiveness; near the end of tonight's program, they skated to Rachmaninoff's piano concerto No. 2, Dmitriev ripped a flap from the front of his black bodysuit, revealing a red patch apparently meant to signify his passionate heart. The audience loved it, but the judges weren't buying it. Only one of nine placed them ahead of Gordeyeva and Grinkov.   \"It is the eternal question between lyrics and physics,\" Moskvina said.   A question that was answered again in the favor of Gordeyeva and Grinkov.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940216","headline":"Woman Pitches and Wins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/sports/sports-people-college-baseball-woman-pitches-and-wins.html","abstract":"  Freshman ILA BORDERS became the first woman to pitch in a National Collegiate Athletic Association or National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics college baseball game yesterday, and she was a rousing success.

Black Sabbath relies, wisely, on material from its first decade, when Ozzy Osbourne was its lead singer and the band was inventing a school of heavy metal. Black Sabbath mixed bulldozing, stop-start riffs, histrionic high-tenor singing and lyrics that veered from tortured idealism to visions of Satanic rituals. By the 1980's, bands like Metallica were citing Black Sabbath as musical forefathers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"CANADIAN AND NORWEGIAN FLY THROUGH THE AIR TO GOLD","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/sports/canadian-and-norwegian-fly-through-the-air-to-gold.html","abstract":"  Jean-Luc Brassard of Canada soared over the moguls course to a freestyle skiing victory.

The Brentano String Quartet made an irresistible case for itself at its New York debut on Tuesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall. Its players -- Mark Steinberg and Serena Canin, violinists; Misha Amory, violist, and Michael Kannen, cellist -- have all attracted attention as soloists in recent seasons. Together, they produce a magnificently blended sound with a remarkable coloristic range.    The concert was presented by the Guild of Composers, so the focus was on contemporary works, with early Berg and late Beethoven providing depth of perspective. Seymour Shifrin's Quartet No. 5 (1975) opened the program. Nearly 20 years after its composition, the work's language -- gracefully angular, scampering, sometimes sensuous, sometimes eerie -- seems quaint and almost nostalgic. And in this group's vivid account it took on an almost visual quality: if you stopped concentrating on musical syntax, the sounds evoked the seemingly chaotic squiggles, slashing lines and bursts of color of a Jackson Pollock painting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940217","headline":"Hard Times, Not Fraud, Explain Loan Defaults; Heroic Jordan College","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/17/opinion/l-hard-times-not-fraud-explain-loan-defaults-heroic-jordan-college-213624.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your Feb. 4 article on the default rates in Federal student loan programs unfairly portrays Jordan College.

The most romantic ending was in an older song, \"Vincent Black Lightning 1952,\" in which a dying thief hands his motorcycle keys to his beloved. Between songs, Mr. Thompson offered droll banter, but there was little comfort when he sang.   Mr. Thompson draws his pessimism from a long tradition of bleakly stoic British traditional songs. His melodies, too, reflect Celtic modal scales and the rhythms of jigs and reels and strathspeys. But Mr. Thompson's traditionalism is hot-wired with modern elements: the verse-chorus-bridge structures of pop songs, Chuck Berry guitar licks, harmonies that wander where folk songs never strayed, and lyrics that recognize a modern, urban world.

Balaban of Copiague told a panel of the State Legislature holding the first statewide hearing on environmental factors in breast cancer.  'Two Years Behind'    Ms. Balaban, the director of the New York State Breast Cancer Hot Line, and other cancer-prevention advocates said measures curbing pesticide use in schools and parks and on golf courses and lawns should be enacted promptly as precautions.    They also criticized a two-year reporting lag in a tumor-incidence list compiled by the State Health Department.   \"We need accurate local and statewide registries so that we know where we are,\" said Lorraine Pace of West Islip, who was recently named a breast cancer education specialist at University Hospital Center here.   \"It's interesting that our tumor registering is two years behind each diagnosis and yet our state lottery is only seconds behind the picking of the numbers,\" she said.    The National Cancer Institute announced a five-year, $5 million study of breast cancer on Long Island last fall, the most extensive study of its kind to date. The breast cancer rate on Long Island is among the highest in the country.   In 1992 a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta suggested that high incidence of breast cancer on Long Island might be linked to rich diets, affluent life styles, age and ethnic origin.    Long Island groups criticized the report and petitioned the National Cancer Institute for a more comprehensive study.    Cancer prevention advocates said today that evidence shows that some pesticide ingredients mimic estrogen or spur its production in the body. They said this effect alone was grounds for new restrictions.    Estrogenic chemicals can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells, some experts say.    Michael Surgan, an environmental scientist in the State Attorney General's office, said that Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell supported a law giving counties and municipalities the power to regulate pesticides.    Currently the State Department of Environmental Conservation regulates pesticides that are labeled safe by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.    \"Long Island should be able to regulate,\" Mr. Surgan said. He said a survey showed that golf course operators on Long Island applied an average of seven times more pesticides an acre than farmers did.   Members of environmental and breast-cancer groups said they also wanted a study of pesticides and other contaminants in water supplies. \"We simply don't think the water is safe,\" said Karen Wolk of the One in Nine Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940218","headline":"Review/Film; Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/movies/review-film-coming-of-age-in-snippets-life-as-a-twentysomething.html","abstract":"Aspiring 20-something filmmaker tracks down friends.

The unconvincing nature of the transformation was only one of the film's many problems. But to at least one viewer, Joan Cox of Evansville, Ind., the story was all too painfully plausible.

In the show's catalogue, you can read learned tributes to Wright's genius. But to approach this show on bended knee would be to miss the nature of that genius. Frank Lloyd Wright was a Mr. Everybody who gave himself the right to radiate.

No road company of \"The Odd Couple\" could have come up with a less likely pair than these two men. The cerebral and often inaccessible Mr. Godard, a master of the French New Wave of the 1960's, has been under a critical and commercial cloud for two decades. Mr. Depardieu is so popular and lucrative a property that a recent story in Variety practically suggested that the French film business might collapse without him.
