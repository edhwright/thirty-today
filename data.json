The average length of claims gives a picture of the job prospects of the recently unemployed but does not account for those entering the job market or the long-term unemployed. While unemployment rates have fallen, after soaring to their highest levels in a decade last year, employment remains flat in the region largely because jobs are not being created.

Lloyd of Morris Heights, the Bronx, staggered into the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center nearly comatose, nearly blind and barely able to walk. Doctors discovered he had severe diabetes, which kept him in the hospital for 10 days. But Mr. Lloyd's more serious medical problem was the lack of a decent general doctor, which for him and hundreds of thousands of others in New York's poorer neighborhoods turns treatable outpatient diseases into life-threatening conditions. This severe deficit of doctors in poor urban neighborhoods will make President Clinton's health-care plan, or any alternative, difficult to carry out in the areas that most need the help. A1. NEW YORK CITY  DIFFERING SHARPLY ON THE ECONOMY  As New York City struggles to shake itself out of its worst recession in half a century, the mayoral candidates are offering sharply different prescriptions on how to revive the local economy -- a split that mirrors a national debate over economic policy. The Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contends that fiscal conservatism -- keeping a balanced budget, streamlining city agencies and keeping them off the backs of business -- provides the best hope for the economy. But Mayor Dinkins has unveiled proposals that many see as a sort of industrial policy, with the city marshaling resources to aid 12 industries in the hope that they will become centers of economic growth.

Here, Hans Werner Henze's Eighth Symphony was framed by works of Berlioz. On Wednesday and Thursday at Carnegie Hall, the orchestra played the Bartok First Piano Concerto with Krystian Zimerman and then the Mahler Fourth Symphony. All three concerts were conducted by Seiji Ozawa who is celebrating his 20th season as music director in Boston.   It is a comment on Mr. Henze's powerful personal voice that his Seventh Symphony -- which can sound so queasy and distasteful in the listener's ear -- and this serenely high-spirited new one use by and large the same methods and materials. A dominating message in Mr. Henze's symphonic style is that moods are not monoliths, that what we receive under the heading of anguish or good humor is in fact roiling complexity composed of many elements.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931018","headline":"'90 Tax Rise Overshadows Trenton Races","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/18/nyregion/90-tax-rise-overshadows-trenton-races.html","abstract":"  The candidates for the New Jersey Legislature know they will face difficult fiscal decisions if they win on Nov. 2: on aid for public schools, auto insurance premiums and Federal clean-air standards, not to mention the perennial question of how to balance the budget.

The very first operas in the early 1600's were about gods and goddesses, a fact explainable by their listeners. Audiences were the height of Venetian nobility; and if opera was by nature larger than their own lives, who else would they have had to look up to?

Canadiens Roll to Victory Over Nordiques  Guy Carbonneau assisted on first-period goals by Ron Wilson and Kevin Haller as the Montreal Canadiens mounted an early lead and went on to a 4-2 road victory over the Quebec Nordiques last night. The Canadiens avenged a 5-2 loss to Quebec in Montreal last Saturday night. The Montreal victory continued a curious pattern in meetings between the provincial rivals: Dating back to last season, the Canadiens have won the last four games in Quebec, while the Nordiques have won the last four in Montreal. (AP) Red Wings 6, Sabres 4: Shawn Burr scored his first three goals of the season and Ray Sheppard snapped a third-period tie to give Detroit the victory in Buffalo. The Red Wings ended a four-game losing streak, while Buffalo extended its losing streak to six games. For the fifth time in those six losses, the Sabres were tied or ahead going into the final period. Sheppard beat Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek between the legs with a short low shot at 6 minutes 20 seconds of the final period on the power play. (AP) Jets 6, Oilers 3: Kris King scored his first goal of the season early in the third period to put Winnipeg ahead to stay at home. The Jets' Thomas Steen had tied the score for the final time halfway through the second period. Keith Tkachuk's score and Steen's second goal followed. Edmonton goalie Fred Brathwaite, making his first start, stopped 36 shots while Jets goalie Bob Essensa blocked 23. (AP) Stars 5, Blackhawks 3: Mike Modano scored twice and added an assist in leading Dallas to victory in Chicago. Darcy Wakaluk, playing his first game in goal this season for the Stars, chipped in with an assist during a three-goal Dallas first period. In the final period, he made a spectacular save on Joe Murphy from point-blank range at 12:38 and one on a 50-foot slap shot by Steve Smith at 13:08 to help preserve the Stars' third victory.

Birt Illustrated. 192 pages. Harry N. Abrams. $39.95.   How does a photographer find his subject? Or must his subject find him? When young Alfred Stieglitz came home from Berlin in 1899, he claimed that New York City was photo-resistant. He had to see the rambunctious vaudevillians Weber and Fields and the great Eleanora Duse in \"Camille\" before he got it: New York's sights, rhythms, tones and sensations dictated their own rules. It was up to the photographer to grasp and make use of them.   Young James VanDerZee came to New York from pastoral Lenox, Mass., in 1908, and he came as a waiter, an elevator operator and a musician. When he finally opened his photography studio in 1917, his subject was Harlem, a city within a city, and its rules were wildly contradictory. What had first been a haven for upper-class Anglo-Saxons had then become a haven for middle- and working-class Irish, Italians and Jews, and was fast becoming a haven for upper-, middle- and working-class blacks from the South, the West and the Caribbean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"DOLE WEAKENING HAITI RESOLUTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/world/dole-weakening-haiti-resolution.html","abstract":"  Apparently lacking the votes to pass a resolution tightly restricting President Clinton's military options in Haiti, Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, negotiated with the White House today about watering it down.

And the evening's principal pleasures come from her ability to create lively dialogue among people whose elaborate systems of defense and justification are set up to be exploded. \"Know thyself\" -- the inscription on the temple at Delphi, as one bombastic character announces -- becomes the play's shibboleth in a way that is both sardonic and earnestly sincere.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Give the Russians Time : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/opinion/IHT-give-the-russians-time-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"I am tired of hearing people criticize Boris Yeltsin for his \"undemocratic policies\" following the recent events at and around Russia's parliament.

Public television's relationship with classical music generally falls somewhere between. There are producers like Jac Venza and John Goberman, who are decidedly fervent, and there are programmers who, always budget conscious, are adept at finding a good deal or acquisition. In the end, at least occasionally, music lovers win.   Tonight's lineup on PBS begins at 8 with Mr. Goberman's series, \"Live From Lincoln Center,\" in a celebration of the Chamber Music Society's 25th anniversary. Mr. Goberman has long crusaded for the live televising of music, dance and opera events. This program -- featuring the pianist Andre Watts, the society's first guest artist member -- will open with the premiere of John Corigliano's Fanfare for Brass, and will also include Debussy's Premiere Rhapsodie and Mozart's Clarinet Quintet, with the clarinetist David Shifrin, who is the society's artistic director.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Life Sign Listed As 8-5 Favorite","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/sports/life-sign-listed-as-8-5-favorite.html","abstract":"  Presidential Ball, Riyadh and Life Sign will race for divisional honors in the $300,000 Cadillac Breeders Crown pace for 3-year-old colts Saturday at Freehold Raceway.

Mr. Dale, who helped invent the surf-music genre in the late 1950's and early 60's, fit the audience's needs perfectly: he is a nearly forgotten figure whose music reflects the mania and voluminousness of American culture at that time.   Surf music, guitar-based and full of huge, whooshing sounds, is the expression of a certain type of innocent American modernity, pure California and pre-pollution, -Watergate and -Vietnam. Mr. Dale, playing a Fender Stratocaster, the quintessential American pop guitar, was hellbent on making noise. He ran his fingers up and down the fret board in long glissandos, sending shimmering metallic sounds out into the room. And he twanged away, letting the low notes ring like a jackhammer on a construction site. In pieces from his new album, \"Tribal Thunder\" (Hightone), Mr. Dale dipped into mambos and Arab scales, and he performed Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" with flair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Justice for J.J.

With its cracker-barrel humor, metaphorical use of the Mississippi River and poignant attempts to bridge the vast American racial divide, \"Show Boat\" is the Broadway musical's answer to \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\" Or would be if Twain had had Florenz Ziegfeld's taste for soaring melodies and lavish spectacle.    In today's American theater, there may be no artist more indebted to \"Show Boat\" than Harold Prince, whose entire career, from the original production of \"West Side Story\" to the current \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" has been devoted to building on the serious musical that Kern and Hammerstein invented. So it is no surprise that Mr. Prince's staging of \"Show Boat\" here, as the opening attraction of the North York Performing Arts Center, is a seismic event in the American musical theater. Given a huge budget, an enormous cast in which Broadway stalwarts vastly outnumber local recruits, and a house that resembles the mammoth Gershwin Theater back home, Mr. Prince has approached the piece as if it were a new work that might have been submitted to him by Stephen Sondheim shortly after their collaboration on \"Sweeney Todd.\" The result is a continuously fascinating display of theatrical wizardry that, largely because of inadequate acting, still falls short of what must be its principal goal: to make \"Show Boat\" as powerful for contemporary audiences as it was for those of the late 1920's and 30's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Theater in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/theater/theater-in-review-628993.html","abstract":"  Marriage Play  Signature Theater Company Kampo Cultural Center 31 Bond Street East Village Through Oct. 31  By Edward Albee; set by E.

If the effect of such scenes is disorienting, it ought to be, since this documentary consists entirely of excerpts from East German newsreels and educational material. Promoting everything from sex education for teen-agers to steamer cruises on the Volga, each of these snippets has its own blunt agenda. \"Show us where children are not so well off,\" a teacher asks a student, spinning a globe. \"Yes! Where capitalism dominates! A good answer.\"   Using no narration, interruptions or other means of breaking the spell, Wolfgang Kissel has strung together a riveting series of vignettes, each of them intended to sway the audience in what now seem laughably clumsy ways. Despite the dated, unbecoming light in which they now appear, though, these scenes are ultimately too sad and serious to play like anything out of \"Reefer Madness.\" Spanning 40 years' worth of East German history, \"Strictly Propaganda\" documents endless deceptions, variously large or insignificant, that add up to a national tragedy. Mr. Kissel makes his film all the more disturbing by never stopping to contrast real events with their absurdly sunny, inspirational counterparts on screen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/nyregion/bridge-052393.html","abstract":"  If your partner opens the bidding and the opponents reach a game, it is reasonable to assume that you can afford to double holding five trumps headed by the ace and a side king.
