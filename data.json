The world they present is small and intimate, but their perception of it is detailed, complex and accepting.   As teacher and collaborator, I try to help the children make photographs that are both new and yet revealing of their culture's visual history. I showed the Indian children in Mexico ancient Mayan pictograms to teach the idea of sequencing photographs and words. In India, at first, the children wanted to photograph their gods and goddesses; they thought that they simply could imagine an image and the camera would produce it. In a Colombian village where there are no windows in the mountain huts and no television sets, the children had never viewed their surroundings through anything; the idea of framing an object or landscape was utterly foreign to them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930717","headline":"The Talk of Paris; France Shows Its Loyalty to a Not-for-Export Sort of Pop Idol","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/17/arts/the-talk-of-paris-france-shows-its-loyalty-to-a-not-for-export-sort-of-pop-idol.html","abstract":"  Johnny Hallyday, although never blessed with a hit single in those twin kingdoms of rock-and-roll, Britain and the United States, has managed to become a special target for Anglo-American scorn.

He is a French idol, the eternal rocker beloved within the Francophonic world and reviled or ignored without.

Tourism and business are booming, overwhelming the modest capacity of local hotels.

Dance fuses past and present for peoples as diverse as the Aymara in Bolivia, where youngsters still perform the Qhashwa on frosty nights to protect the potato crop, and the Kiowa in Oklahoma, where veterans of Operation Desert Storm perform dances at meetings of the Black Legs Society. Unfortunately, the accompanying essays, written by scholars and curators, fail to match the impact of the photographs and presume a working knowledge of American Indian cosmology and history. The authors tend to dwell on esoteric matters, like variations in costume. The best essays, like that on Northern Plains dances by Lynn Huenemann, an Indian education official in Iowa, make a point of quoting performers, who tell how dancing can heal sickness and protect crops; their words make the magical seem part of everyday life.

Not Enough Evidence to Deport    Dr. Stephan said that despite Miss Mann's apparently eager cooperation with the F.B.I. and despite her repeated denials of ties to Communists, the Immigration and Naturalization Service wanted to deport her in 1951. He said neither the I.N.S. nor the F.B.I. ever found enough evidence to start proceedings to do so. Miss Mann died in 1969 at the age of 63.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Measuring the Threat of Power Lines","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/nyregion/measuring-the-threat-of-power-lines.html","abstract":"  THE looming presence of transmission power lines near a handful of Westchester schools has been an unremarkable fact of life for students and their parents for decades.

This is unusual for Tanana -- unusual for any Mets pitcher, really -- but it was not an out-of-place feeling in this improbable game.   What a sight it was this afternoon, the 40-year-old pitcher, backed by the worst team in baseball and on the trading block, taking apart the club with the best record and highest batting average in the major leagues. For six and two-thirds innings, Tanana kept the Giants unsettled with his array of off-speed pitches, occasionally beating a batter with a 78 mile-an-hour fastball that surprised. During that stretch, only Will Clark, who was hit by a pitch on his left elbow in the first inning, managed to reach base.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Circuit Problem Delays Shuttle Launching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/us/circuit-problem-delays-shuttle-launching.html","abstract":"  A bad firing circuit on explosive bolts intended to free the 18-story space shuttle Discovery from its launch pad forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to cancel the launching planned for this morning and postpone the nine-day mission for a week or so.

Many of the elegant small Gothic and Renaissance palaces that rim the main square have been repainted in the last two years. Jazz spots in stone cellars are being scrubbed down; new sidewalk cafes with spiffy furniture and umbrellas are opening almost weekly, it seems. Bookshops, art and antiques galleries show the contemporary and the old. The food, if you choose carefully, is perking up.    This reawakening is taking place against the backdrop of Cracow's immutable strengths: an old town of narrow cobbled streets and 60 churches, the Jagiellonian University, which counts Copernicus and Pope John Paul II among its alumni, and the 13th-century Wawel royal castle, a moody, dark bulk of fortressed walls, onion domes and spires atop a limestone hill. Complementing Cracow's architecture is its music. The variety of excellent music being performed makes Cracow more than just another museum town. During a few days' stay, a Baroque chamber concert in a palace salon, a jazz group in a subterranean club or opera at the 1897 Juliusz Slowacki theater, a glittering miniature version of the Paris Opera, is almost assured.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Making Color Last: An Expert Speaks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/camera-making-color-last-an-expert-speaks.html","abstract":"  NOT many photographers walk into a photo shop and ask, \"Will the film you're selling me and the prints you make last a hundred years?\"    But Henry Wilhelm has spent most of his life in the world of photography testing how long photographic films and prints -- both black-and-white and color -- can last, and what can be done to make them last longer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"They Were Smart, All Right, But Then This Is a TV Movie","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/arts/television-view-they-were-smart-all-right-but-then-this-is-a-tv-movie.html","abstract":"  If a 40-year-old woman meets her former best friend, a younger woman now married to the older woman's ex-husband, what does the first wife say to the second wife?   a) \"You lookin' at me?\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Nutritional Curiosity In Medicine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/nyregion/l-nutritional-curiosity-in-medicine-972593.html","abstract":"  Your interview with Dr. David Walters (June 27) points out a disappointing lack of nutritional curiosity in medicine.

In many cases, letting a child into the minibar would be cheaper.   The worst situation appears to be dialing a long-distance call, with the toll to be charged to your room bill. Even when you dial every digit yourself, it will probably be billed at the higher operator-assisted rate, and there will be a surcharge beyond that, which may be as high as 50 percent of the cost of the call. Sometimes the surcharge is by the call, sometimes by the minute, sometimes a combination.

There's no bronze. There's no bronze-tinted glass. There's no Four Seasons, with its bronzed and burnished clientele. At 860-880, the glass is clear; the structural skeletons of the two apartment towers are painted black. No sleek curtain wall smooths over their jutting bones. And unlike Seagram's rows of neatly calibrated window shades, the windows at 860-880 are dressed with heavy curtains, randomly bunched against the sun.   It may take a while, in other words, to register that Miesian refinement did not depend on sumptuous materials or polished perfection. It required clarity of purpose, 3,000 years of geometry, and a good eye. No. 860-880 has the rawness of invention. This is Mies fresh out of the box or, more accurately, fresh into it. Built in 1949-51, these two Chicago towers are the first examples of the steel-and-glass high-rises that conquered the world.

But its pairing of 19th-century African \"power objects\" with the work of a contemporary African-American artist implicitly raises questions about the relationship of Western and non-Western art that the exhibition comes nowhere near answering.  The show, which runs through Jan. 2, includes more than 30 carved wooden figures called \"minkisi\" (min-KEY-see, roughly translated as \"things that do things\"). They were made a century ago by the people of Kongo (an ancient territory that covered parts of present-day Congo, Angola and Zaire). Wrapped in fabric or bristling with nails, these objects are credited with the power to change human lives. The last gallery is devoted to work by Renee Stout, a young Washington artist whose sculptures adapt many superficial features of these figures.    Superficiality is the problem. For although \"Astonishment and Power\" suggests a continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today, it reveals instead how tenuous this connection can be if crucial cultural differences are ignored.  In fact, the most satisfying way for a viewer to approach \"Astonishment and Power\" is to treat the Kongo objects, carefully mounted and documented by Wyatt MacGaffey, an anthropologist, as an exhibition in itself. Although most of the minkisi (\"nkisi\" in the singular) in the show are human figures, they can also take the form of clay pots, leaf-wrapped packets or stitched cloth pouches. Once the nkisi is implanted with symbolic medicines -- ashes, roots, seeds, crushed bone, or dirt taken from graves -- it is considered to be inhabited by a spirit whose energies can be activated, often for a fee, by the insertion of nails or metal blades into the object itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Rama Atassi, Souheil Hajjar","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/style/weddings-rama-atassi-souheil-hajjar.html","abstract":"  Rama Atassi, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. M.

The ones about Herbert von Karajan are singular in that almost every punch line makes the same essential point. Here's a sample: Karajan goes to the undertaker and wants to look at coffins -- something simple and economical, please. The undertaker interprets this in his own way and shows various models of fine material and elegant design, each of which is rejected. Finally the conductor insists on being shown simple wooden coffins and selects one. Undertaker, pained: \"But tell me, Herr von Karajan, why, for such an important occasion, should you economize?\" Karajan, calm: \"And why should I spend a fortune when I'm only staying three days?\"   In fact Karajan was not so trusting about resurrection; he was more like the ancient pharaohs, providing elaborately for his posthumous comfort. The central project of his last decade was to document on film, for eventual release on laser disk, the core repertory he had conducted and recorded so often during his remarkable career. (It was typical of his confidence that he conceived this series on such a grand scale before the commercial viability of the laser disk had even been tested.) An enormous first installment is now available from Sony Classical, dominating the orchestral video market by sheer quantity.

Manley (\"How Big Were Garbo's Feet?,\" June 20). When I wrote \"First Nights,\" I probably knew as much about Garbo's feet as anyone else except Garbo herself. I know, for instance, that when filming, she would ask, \"Is the feets in?\" and if they weren't she would film the scene in fluffy bedroom slippers. I know about a shopping trip for shoes she took with the actress Eleanor Boardman, during which she bought a pair of shoes, wore them, found them uncomfortable and then insisted on returning them. But \"First Nights\" is a novel, and fiction is a record of that conflagration that occurs when reality collides with imagination. Anna Asta is a portrayal of the personality I sensed emerging through those unforgettable films. I can only hope I succeeded. Much of \"First Nights\" was literally inspired by Garbo.

Unlike much other recent downtown music, Totalist music is totally scored, not improvised. It aspires to sounds and textures more complex than anything associated with the downtown scene or its pop counterparts. Just as uptown locales have begun to institutionalize downtown, downtown has begun to rethink uptown.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930718","headline":"Steamers Still Ply The Mississippi","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/18/travel/travel-advisory-steamers-still-ply-the-mississippi.html","abstract":"  Floodwaters on the Upper Mississippi, which have swelled the flow of the river by hundreds of thousands of cubic feet per second, have stopped neither the steamer Mississippi Queen nor the National Historic Landmark paddlewheeler the Delta Queen.

Tom, Dan and Peter know who won; they just don't tell you and me, and everyone pretends we don't know they know. Politics and movies are both areas where the spin doctor is king, and both have been slow to wake up to the fact that the public is now savvy about the spin itself.    Movie hype, always at its peak when dealing with summer's potential blockbusters, has become more complex as audiences have grown increasingly knowledgeable. Box-office grosses, once confined to the pages of Variety, now appear everywhere from The New York Times to Entertainment Weekly; Vanity Fair profiles Hollywood agents alongside celebs. In this environment, advance word goes beyond advertising. It includes the good buzz that a studio wants the public to hear (\"Arnold's biggest movie yet!\"), the bad buzz that a studio's competitors want the public to hear (\"Arnold's in trouble!

Mr. Kline is putting his artistic capital where his mouth is, contributing a scintillating performance to \"Measure for Measure\" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, in the first Shakespeare production from the George C. Wolfe regime. That this actor and the large company around him have brought off a show this fine, not to mention energetic, during a virulent heat wave may in fact constitute valor above and beyond the call of duty.   The director is Michael Rudman, an American who has mainly worked in England (with the prominent exception of the Dustin Hoffman \"Death of a Salesman\" on Broadway). His approach to this darkest of Shakespearean comedies is feather light: as he also did at the National Theater in London a dozen years ago, Mr. Rudman has switched the play's setting from an intrigue-filled Vienna to a sunny Caribbean island of the 1940's. The endlessly fascinating psychological and moral shadings of the piece vanish with Vienna, but the comic interludes, which are usually neglected in weightier stagings, have rarely been funnier.

King, who started the final round with a one-shot lead over Kobayashi, faltered with a 75 and finished alone in third place, five shots back.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930719","headline":"French Revival Is Much Needed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/19/sports/cycling-french-revival-is-much-needed.html","abstract":"  Pascal Lino, a convenient symbol for all that has gone wrong in French professional bicycle racing this season, reclaimed a few credits today by winning a sprint finish in the Tour de France and ending a national embarrassment.   When Lino passed the finish line in Perpignan half a wheel ahead of Giancarlo Perini, he became the first Frenchman to win a stage in this 80th Tour.

So why was Xu Yiruo assembling Christmas tree lights in the Qingdao No. 1 Prison?   Christmas trees and Christmas tree lights are almost unknown in China, so it is almost inconceivable that the lights were for sale in the domestic market. Mr. Xu says prison officials spoke of the lights' being exported to Britain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930719","time":"1993-07-19
