Usually small, always portable, from ancient times they have moved from country to country, hand to hand, the mass media of their day. Through them, scientific data, religious ideas and historical views were shared. In certain cases, as with Judaism and Islam, books were the primary means by which a culture presented itself to the world.    This was also true of the oldest Christian nation, Armenia, whose religious practices were based on a devotion to the Gospels so complete as to embrace not only their message but their physical presence as well. Illuminated Gospels, written in Armenia in the Armenian vernacular, were the country's primary art form. With their exotic, visionary paintings and bindings fitted with jeweled silver plaques, they were carried in procession, used as talismans against illness and regarded as living things to be ransomed at any price if captured in battle. And to the patrons who commissioned them and the artists who made them, they were \"treasures in heaven\" -- tangible guarantees of salvation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Down the Storied Shannon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/travel/down-the-storied-shannon.html","abstract":"THE boat glides past lush water meadows dappled with cattle as an echelon of swans beats across a wide reach of the river.

To stimulate the regional economy, once dependent on timber, sheep and handicrafts, the Navarrese provincial government made loans to villagers willing to renovate their homes to accommodate tourists, mostly Spaniards, who come here for skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, cycling, fishing and hunting.\n\nSome casas rurales offer home-cooked meals, usually accompanied by one of Navarre's first-rate rosados, or sturdy red wines, for $7 to $10. The Navarrese are noteworthy cooks and many families grow their own vegetables and make sheep's milk cheese and cuajada (a delicious yogurtlike dessert). Even if meals aren't offered, most Pyrenean towns have simple restaurants serving such typical dishes as esparragos blancos (white asparagus), alubias (bean stew), pimientos rellenos (stuffed peppers), revueltos (eggs scrambled with mushrooms, green garlic shoots, shrimp, etc.), fresh trucha (trout), costillas de cordero (lamb chops) and cuajada. In sping and autumn, there are dishes with exceptional native mushrooms. I decided to begin my three-day trip to Navarre last spring with a nostalgic drive from Madrid to Burguete, a favorite place from previous trips. I would stay at a casa rural in Ochagavia, explore the Salazar Valley the next day, and end up in Roncal the next night.\n\nThe Camino de Santiago crosses the French border north of Burguete and winds through the hills above Roncesvalles, where Charlemagne's nephew Roland was immortalized in the epic poem \"Chanson de Roland.\" These mystical woods are imbued with the spirit of Roland and the Santiago de Compostela-bound pilgrims who passed this way. The restored 12th-century Roncesvalies monastery was once a proud pilgrim's hospice, known for its good food, real beds and its cobbler.\n\nBecause I wanted to reach Ochagavia before nightfall, I could spend just a few moments in Burguete -- stopping for coffee at a bar across the street from Hostal Burguete, which hasn't changed much since the 1920's, when Hemingway stayed there. In \"The Sun Also Rises,\" Jack Barnes and Bill Gorton went to Burguete to fish the Irati, a good hike east. The hostal's owners say the piano, which has \"E. Hemingway\" (sic) scratched under the lid, is the one in the novel.\n\nDriving on from Burguete through the rocky forests, I passed pretty, bucolic Garalda; Arrive, with its fine medieval bridge over the Irati, and Garayoa with a 13th-century Gothic church. High escarpments tower above the roads to the Abaurrea pass (3,320 feet), where I got a first glimpse of the snow-capped Pyrenean peaks, now suffused with a lovely peach glow from the setting sun. A series of hairpin turns would down a steep valley past Ezcaroz on the swift Salazar River just below Ochagavia, the valley's main town.\n\nOchagavia is a charming mountain-bound village of just under 800 inhabitants laid out along two sizable streams that form the Salazar at the town's southern outskirts. A passer-by showed me to Casa Osaba, a big stone house on a cobbled street. Gabriela Moso, the owner, led me up two flights to a plank-floored bedroom that had a big bed with warm coverlets, an armoire, and a night stand with the obligatory dim-bulbed lamp; down the hall was a new bathroom with plenty of hot water. In the family's modestly furnished second-floor dining room with a fireplace, was a herrada, a gleaming brass-and-steel, megaphone-shaped water vessel -- a unique piece of folk art. Gabriela invited one for dinner at 10 P.M.\n\nI took advantage of the remaining night to explore Ochagavia. Most of the houses are two-and three-story stone homes with white facades, tiled roofs, shuttered windows and flower-filled, wrought-iron balconies. The dates -- 1768, 1908 and 1926 -- on the arched stone portals above stout wooden doors, speak to their durability. The rough streets are hand-paved with river stones, requiring sturdy footwear. Across a stone bridge I found Pension Aunamendi, whose restaurant offers an inexpensive menu, but alas, no tapas at the bar. As I returned to Casa Osaba, wood smoke curling from the village's chimneys sharpened my hunger. I hoped Gabriela was a cook worthy of Navarre's reputation.\n\nIn the dining room I met Gabriel's family: her husband, daughter, grandson, and her son-in-law, who tends a large herd of sheep near Tudela. (Some proficiency in Spanish is necessary to get the most out of family dining situations such as this one.) In front of the cracking fire, Gabriela served a fine salad with white asparagus; garlicky green beans and potatoes; merluza rebozada (Hake in batter); fireplace-grilled pork chops; fresh cherries, and a good rosado.\n\nAfter dinner there was coffee and homemade pacharan, Navarre's sole berry-anise liqueur. After a chat about life in America, I went to bed, gave up reading in the dim light and slept soundly until morning. Breakfast was toast, butter and homemade plum jam; galletas, or snap cookies, and coffee. Bed and breakfast was about $12.\n\nFrom Ochagavia I followed the Salazar south through forests punctuated by striking cliffs and rock formation. Ancient stone houses, block-tower churches and cobbled streets give this valley's 15 villages a medieval air. Below Ezparza, a picturesque village with a Romanesque bridge, a 16th century church, and a trout farm, the road winds through spectacular gorges. Occasionally, a falcon soared overhead. Fields of poppies lined the road to Navascues, where I stopped to see the 12th-century Romanesque Santa Maria del Campo church, which stands in ancient solitude alongside the village cemetery southwest town. North of Navascues, the Roncal road curves up steep, craggy hills to Las Coronas pass (3,120 feet), where there is a splendid vista of the Roncal Valley.\n\nNine more miles of twisting roads brought me to Burgui, a dramatic town with a Romanesque bridge and a breathtaking canyon to its south. Along the river banks I saw almadias (Log rafts) used by almadieros, who re-enact the dangerous feats when, before trucking and a downriver dam was built, daring loggers rode rafts down the swolled river to the sawmills each spring. At Burgui the road joins the Pamplona-to-Roncal highway, following the Esca River through more precipitous gorges with waterfalls and suspension bridges linking trails over the river.\n\nAt Roncal's southern edge, on a hill overlooking the town, I found Casa Indiano, the charming two-story fieldstone home of Ana Maria Donazar, a grandmother who dotes, with equal amount of loving care, on her young grandson and her casa's rustic pinetimbered interior. The living quarters, including a kitchen with spectacular valley views, were on the second floor. Mrs. Donazar put me in a small room with a double bed, just across from a clean, modern bathroom.\n\nThe Roncal Valley is famous for its colorful folklore and its cheese. In early July the Roncalese dress in regiona costumes for a romeria (Pilgrimage cum picnic) at the hermitage of Idoya near Isaba. On July 13, Roncal Valley's seven mayors turn out in typical costumes for the \"Tribute of the Three Cows\" offered by their French neighbors from Bearn. This annual event dates from the Middle Ages and draws thousands to a site near the border.\n\nRoncal's renowned sheep's cheese, queso Roncal, reminiscent of Italian Parmesan, but milder and softer, was the first Spanish cheese granted a denominacion de origen (Like that for wine). Once an artisanal cheese, queso Roncal today is mostly made in a local factory.\n\nRocal's houses are of the same stout construction as Ochagaviea's but of more distinctive architecture. Like most towns here, its interior streets are paved with river stones. The home of the Roncalese tenor Julian Gayarre (1844 to 1890), the greatest Spanish opera singer of his time, is now a museum displaying mementos from his illustrious career. At Roncal's northern edge, the Esca runs by a trout farm acrosss from a park with picnic tables and fine views of the town's massive church.\n\nFor lunch, near Casa Indiano, I found Restaurante Begona, a small cafe overlooking the Esca. On the wall was a photograph of Roncal's trout fishing champion, a man wearing a huge Basque beret. When I asked for trout, Begona, who answers the noisy telephone, waits on tables and cooks, told me, \"You have to call ahead.\" I opted for salad, red bean and chorizo stew, revueltos con ajos y gambas (eggs with garlic shoots and shrimp), and queso Roncal. When I ordered a bottle of rosado, Begona handed me the corkscrew. Lunch was $10.\n\nNorth of Roncal is Isaba, an attractive village in a lush valley below the rugged gray-tone peaks that poke through the surrounding forests like giant teeth and culminate the Mesa de los Tres Reyes, Navarra's highest mountain at 7,984 feet. Saving a tour of Isaba for evening, I head north toward the mountains. On the way I saw fishmen working the Belagua, a stream criss-crossed by rustic stone bridges. On the plain below herds of sheep grazed and mares nursed wobbly-legged foals. Signs on farmhouses offered homemade cheeses.\n\nBeyond the plain the road climbed steeply for several miles to the heights of Belagua overlooking the valley. Halfway up the mountain at the Venta de Juan Pito, one can lunch on migas (Bread fried with oil and garlic) and grilled lamb chops by a big fireplace in the rustic dining room. The nearby Belagua ski refuge has spectacular cross-county and downhill trails, but no lifts. The road climbed through increasingly rugged terrain, where intensely blue wildflowers grew in striking juxtaposition to the rocks and snow. Finally, the road ran through a snow-lined pass with splendid views of France.\n\nThat evening I strolled through Isaba, admiring the streets and houses that seem to be made of the same rectangular stones, the flowerfestooned balconies and arched doorways. Since Roncal has few placed to eat, I dined in Isaba at Hostal Lola's popular restaurant, where peppers stuffed with bacalao, trout with ham, cuajada, a good rosado and coffee came to about $20. Back in Roncal I found a lively bar for a pacharan nightcap. A sign on th wall said \"If bullfighting is art, cannibalism is gastronomy.\"\n\nThe next morning at Casa Indiano Mrs. Donazar and her husband, with the \"help\" of their grandson, Xavier, gave me a breakfast of cafe con leche, pan tostado with homemade jam and galletas. I paid my bill (about $14 with breakfast) and reluctantly began the daylong ride out of these splendid mountains to Madrid.\n\nThe little boy and his grandmother waved goodbye from an upstairs window.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Fresh Air Fund Opens Window on Another World","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/nyregion/fresh-air-fund-opens-window-on-another-world.html","abstract":"  There is a kind of assuredness in Arthur Anderson's voice when he talks about both his future and his past.

For Raymond, a 13-year-old Little League catcher, the stack of balls is more than a reminder of personal glory. It is a memorial.   In April 1993, a holdup man gunned down his father at his convenience store. A week later, Raymond hit a ball clear over the fence at Holcombe Rucker Park. Someone retrieved the ball and gave it to Raymond, who saved it and dedicated it to his father.   \"I save them because that's what my father wanted me to be, a good ballplayer,\" Raymond said. \"I want to be Babe Ruth Jr. I'm saving them so I can someday show my kids I hit a lot of home runs.\"   Five years ago, Little League baseball didn't even exist in Harlem. Now there are so many young people like Raymond Molina showing up to play in the Harlem Little League that Iris and Dwight Raiford, the league's founders, are resorting to creative ways to find space, like using soccer fields at City College. Every Saturday, 46 teams and more than 650 boys and girls, aged 5 to 15, in brightly colored T-shirts are sprinkled across diamonds around then neighborhood.   There has been an outpouring of support. Private sponsors have put up the $100-per-player costs of shirts, shoes, bats, gloves and balls. Local bankers, doctors, dentists, lawyers, teachers and political leaders are financing teams, like the Lion Insurance \"Lions\" or the United Doctors of Harlem \"Medicos.\"   Parents and friends are volunteering their time as umpires, coaches and guardians, like Tony Sanchez, who roams the different fields as head umpire when he's not coaching his own team or playing himself. Unmarked police cars often idle nearby as officers stop to watch.   And, with city help, Holcombe Rucker, a small park tucked away under the Triborough Bridge at 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, has been transformed. Once overgrown with weeds and covered with graffiti, the park now has lush grass, new lights, chalk lines and a silver chain fence.   \"This is our gem,\" said Iris Raiford, her back toward Yankee Stadium looming in the background. \"This is the best.\"   The Raifords, a Harlem couple, began dreaming of the league eight years ago, when their son Josh begged them for a place to play baseball. They got a charter from the Little League Foundation and successfully lobbied Mayor Dinkins to dig up a few asphalt-covered parks and provide money for Holcombe Rucker.   Mr. Raiford, a Citicorp vice president, and Ms. Raiford, a domestic violence coordinator for the Manhattan District Attorney, also got the word out in Harlem.   Tehya Roberson, a 13-year-old third basewoman for the Stylists, plays on one of two new softball teams in the league started by her mother, Cecelia. And Tehya plans to stay with Harlem Little League, even into high school, \"seeing as my mom is the coach, and I have a lot of friends on the team.\"   \"Most of these children come from single-parent families,\" Dwight Raiford said. \"There's an African saying, 'It takes a village to raise a child.\"' LORI NICKEL","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Sludge Smell: Peril to a Park?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-sludge-smell-peril-to-a-park.html","abstract":"  On summer weekends, hundreds of people trek across a footbridge from East Harlem to the broad expanse of grass on the southern end of Wards Island.

Pride of place, filling the entry hall of Cuba's Museo Nacional, goes to a 100-foot-long photomontage by the New York artist Michael Lebron lambasting the owners of Coors beer for supporting right-wing causes. The work was conceived for a billboard at Pennsylvania Station in New York, but after Amtrak officials refused to display it made its debut here in a wholly different context.   Salsa bands, rum-based drinks and the presence of the Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez lent a festive air to the opening last month. But with the Cuban capital crumbling into ruin and its residents suffering severe shortages of food, electricity and transportation, this extravaganza, involving 738 works by 171 artists from 41 countries, is taking place against an anomalous backdrop.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"U.S. Blacks Find Study in Brazil a Bittersweet Experience","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/world/us-blacks-find-study-in-brazil-a-bittersweet-experience.html","abstract":"  Last winter, Kelli Moore left Spelman College in Atlanta for Brazil, thinking that she was going to visit \"the Africa of the Western Hemisphere.\"    Instead, Ms. Moore, a political science major, finds that she is the only black student in her classes at the University of Sao Paulo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"First, Surveys.

For one thing, major social welfare legislation seems to run in a three-decade cycle. Medicare was created 30 years ago, Social Security 30 years before that.   Then in 1991, a long-shot candidate, Harris Wofford, won a Senate election in Pennsylvania by running on health care. Republicans got the hint. At the start of the 1992 campaign year, President George Bush promised a \"comprehensive health reform program.\"   But then Mr. Bush's natural passivity kicked in. White House interest faded, handing Bill Clinton the issue that became the centerpiece of his campaign. It is also the issue that may well determine whether Mr. Clinton's is remembered as a notable Presidency.   One reasons is that universal health care has been both a crying national need and a potently divisive social and legislative issue for a long time. The American Medical Association used the specter of \"Socialized medicine\" to defeat Harry S. Truman's plan for national health insurance in 1945.   The same demagoguery still works, but that does not change the agreed facts. Health care consumes one-seventh of the gross national product, far more than what other industrialized democracies spend to extend health care to all their citizens.   Even so, the U.S. system leaves 37 million people without health insurance. And while American who can afford it get the best care in the world, the current system makes little sense in terms of economic competitiveness or social equity.   It is possible to study the problem and come up with a number of solutions, including, for example, a Government financed, or single-payer, system like Canada's. The Times's editorial page has advocated the managed competition model, which borrows the mandatory participation feature of government programs -- guaranteeing that everyone is covered -- but relies on carefully structured competition between private plans to deliver health care.   Mr. Clinton deserves credit for specifying universal coverage with private insurance as the anchors of his plan. By so doing, he set the boundaries for the ideological debate. The legislative struggle now under way has to do with how much of the Clinton ideology will survive and also with the architecture and mechanics of the new system.   Although Mr. Clinton has shaped the debate in a positive way, the White House team has made tactical mistakes. The most serious was its decision to draft its health care proposal in secret sessions presided over by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira Magaziner. The lack of public hearings wasted a opportunity to build public support and increase the pressure on Congress to respond to public need rather than the health care lobbyists.   The task force wound up alienating many of the experts that Mrs. Clinton gathered in the White House to create policy. They saw virtually no imprint of their work on the bill that the First Lady's inner circle put together.   Another tactical misstep was to send to Capitol Hill a 1,300-page mega-bill that purports to solve every medical problem the country has ever experienced. A tighter bill would have been a tougher target for critics to hit. Political necessity also warped the Clinton plan when the task force decided to propose only those reforms that would not require a broad-based tax. That single decision shaped virtually every feature of the reform, from the controversial purchasing alliances to cost controls, and produced a bill that many in Congress have declared unworkable.   These missteps made the job of the Democratic Congressional leaders immeasurably harder. They weren't helped by Republicans like the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, who characterized the Clinton effort as \"A massive overdose of Government control.\" But other Republicans, like Senators John Chafee and John Danfoth, have struggled to find a consensus plan.   Until the past few weeks, the White House vacillated between trying to ram a bill through Congress with a slim majority of Democratic votes and reaching for a bipartisan compromise. When Senator Edward M. Kennedy received President and Mrs. Clinton's blessing for his modified version of their plan, that was an important signal. It meant that the season of bipartisan bargaining had begun.   June is the critical month. If the committees do not finish most of their work this month, Congress will run out of time before the lawmakers break for the November elections and the entire effort could collapse.   Whatever the flaws in the process of writing the bill or in the bill itself, the Clinton health reform has now created a sene of urgency on the Hill. And by assigning his wife to lead the effort, Mr. Clinton made a pact not to ditch health care reform no matter how tought the fight. For him, the real test of success will be coming away with some viable form of universal coverage. Then he can take credit for a landmark achievement in social policy that will earn him a place in history no matter what else occurs in his tenure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Bermuda Race Ignites an Old Fire Between Pro and Amateur Sailors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/sports/yacht-racing-bermuda-race-ignites-an-old-fire-between-pro-and-amateur-sailors.html","abstract":"  It is a smoldering problem in sport, that unhappy mingling of amateur and professional.

In the third grade I had a principal who took the students for nature walks behind the school's land, walking along the edge of the farm's planted field, just over the fence from the playground. I recall the setting of my grammar school with the fondness of a child who grew up in undeveloped surroundings.   I recall, in early spring, watching the tractors plow the fields and later spring when sweet aromas from growing corn or bean crops would flow through the playground. I even recall, though vaguely and possibly wrongly, a W.P.A. mural of a New Jersey agricultural scene inside the school. If my memory is only fantasy in that latter aspect, it should still serve to demonstrate the power of place.    Though development had begun in North Brunswick during my childhood, the small region between the Pulda farm, Church Lane and Farrington Lake indelibly formed my understanding of and reverence for the land.   I graduated from North Brunswick Township High School in 1979 and lived for the next 12 years outside of New Jersey, until 1991, when my wife and I returned, initially residing in Princeton. During those 12 years, upon my occasional visits home, I began to notice the sprawl of development throughout North Brunswick.   Eventually, it even began to encroach on my parents' home, where I was reared, set back in an undisturbed wooded area. I commented how the whole central region was undergoing \"Los Angelization\" from Newark to Camden.   The article on the Pulda farm is but the late call of awareness to what lifetime residents of central New Jersey have lost. It also demonstrates the perennial shortsightedness of my home township, a shortsightedness that has led to the gradual and persistent \"selling off of its inheritance\": the healing nature of spacious land, the nurturing influence of agrarian culture and the spiritual equanimity afforded by living in less crowded conditions.   The most crucial loss as the result of this environmental and demographic change has been the loss of a sense of belonging and contributing to a common good. My home township always prized individual gain over community health, but perhaps a township without a historic town center was predisposed for such a world view.   Had we had vision, a view larger than ourselves oriented toward deeper values, that predisposition might not have become fate. The covetousness of township bureaucrats must be called just that, a sin.   Nevertheless, one choice still remains: let Mr. Pulda live out his life on his farm. Let Edwin Otken (another local hero) continue to farm his rented land. Let the county or the state or even Cook College consider negotiating an agreement to designate the sight historic -- which it obviously is -- and create a living, working museum about agricultural life in this portion of the Garden State.   Though the many new generations of North Brunswick residents will never know grammar school surrounded by a living, producing farm, at least they could learn of a deeper view of living, and learn how to plant a small garden of their own.

COACH Paul Van Himst. One of the best players in the long history of Belgian soccer, he was named to replace Guy Thys in 1991 after the Red Devils failed to qualify for the 1992 European championship. As a star for RSC Anderlecht, he was nicknamed \"the white Pele\" and became Belgium's top career international scorer with 30 goals. STYLE While midfielder Enzo Scifo, who sets the pace with his technical skill and vision, is adept at getting the ball to his teammates, the forwards are less adept at finishing. After a quick start in World Cup qualifying with six straight victories, the Belgians struggled in their last four matches. Even if they get more punch up front, they will continue to rely heavily on defense.   TOP PLAYERS In Scifo, the Belgians have one of the game's best playmakers. He has already played in two World Cup finals. They also have a fine goalkeeper in 35-year-old Michel Preud'homme and two excellent defenders in Philippe Albert and Georges Grun, who are both coming back from knee injuries. Albert will miss the opening match because of a red card he received in the final qualifying match. Franky Van der Elst and the attack-minded Marc Degryse are quality midfielders. OUTLOOK This is the Belgians' fourth straight appearance in the cup finals. They should advance to the second round thanks to Scifo, the strength of their defense and the relative weakness of their group. How they fare after that will probably depend on whether Van Himst can find a reliable goal scorer. One player to remember is Josip Weber, a Croat who became a naturalized Belgian in March. Weber did not play in any of the World Cup qualifying matches, but he has led the Belgian first division in scoring for the past three seasons. Morocco CUP APPEARANCES Two (1970, 1986) LAST CUP 1986. BEST SHOWING Second round in 1986 FIRST ROUND Belgium, June 19 in Orlando, Fla.; Saudi Arabia, June 25 in East Rutherford, N.J.; the Netherlands, June 29 in Orlando. COACH A former world-class team handball player, Abdellah Ajri Blinda became coach of the national soccer team in September 1993, little more than a month before the decisive qualifying match against Zambia in Casablanca. Blinda guided the Lions of Atlas to a 1-0 victory. STYLE Like most North African teams, the Moroccans play with a south European flair, which means lots of short, quick passes, technical excellence and creativity. Rachid Daoudi, Mustapha el-Hadaoui and Mustapha Hadji, midfielders in the Moroccan 4-4-2, are at the heart of much of this. Lacking is consistency and a certain physical strength. TOP PLAYERS The star of the team, Daoudi, has played for WAC Casablanca since he was a teen-ager. Daoudi, 28, is a left-footed artist with free kicks and an excellent passer. The best of the expatriates are defender Nourredine Naybet, forward Mohammed Chaouch and el-Hadaoui, who all play professionally in France. Another with a French connection is Hadji, 22, whose family immigrated to France when he was a boy. He decided to play for Morocco even though he speaks no Arabic and was a star of the victory over Zambia. OUTLOOK This team is solid and opportunistic with a good defense. It is also used to hot, humid conditions, which, because it plays twice in Orlando is potentially significant. But Morocco lacks a truly dominant player, and though it should have little problem with Saudi Arabia, the Belgians and Dutch are a different matter. It would be a mild surprise if they reached the second round. Netherlands CUP APPEARANCES Six (1934, 1938, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1994.) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to West Germany, 2-1, in second round) BEST SHOWING Runner-up in 1974 and 1978. FIRST ROUND Saudi Arabia, June 20 in Washington; Belgium, June 25 in Orlando, Fla.; Morocco, June 29 in Orlando. COACH Despite leading the Dutch through a difficult qualifying group, Dick Advocaat was not guaranteed a place on the bench for the World Cup finals. His spot was only assured after Dutch soccer officials' negotiations with the considerably more renowned Johan Cruyff broke down. As a player, Advocaat, 46, was a respectable defender and midfielder. He is the former coach of the Dutch club FC Haarlem and became national team coach after the 1992 European Championship.   STYLE Unlike many top teams in the 1990's, the Dutch are committed to the attack with four men up front: two wings, a center-forward and a fourth player floating between midfield and the front line. Opposing goaltenders will see a lot of Ronald Koeman, a dangerous sweeper. TOP PLAYERS Striker Marco van Basten, the three-time European player of the year, first said he had recovered from his ankle injury and would play in the finals. Last week, he said he wouldn't because his club, AC Milan, was opposed. The more unexpected blow came May 30 when Ruud Gullit cut short his comeback with the national team and quit. The Dutch will have to make do with the group that got them to the United States in the first place: a group led by the gifted forward Dennis Bergkamp, versatile midfielder Frank Rijkaard and sweeper Ronald Koeman. OUTLOOK With Gullit and a healthy \"Marco Golo,\" the Dutch arguably would have been the most talented team in the tournament. Without them, the team's stock has dropped, but not as much as one might think. Even with all their stars in 1990, the Dutch barely squeaked into the second round. This time, much will depend on how quickly the team adjusts to Gullit's departure, how well Bergkamp shoulders the offensive burden. With all its questions, this team could still go a long way. Saudi Arabia CUP APPEARANCES This is the first.  FIRST ROUND The Netherlands, June 20 in Washington; Morocco, June 25 in East Rutherford, N.J., and Belgium, June 29 in Washington. COACH Jorge Solari, but maybe not for long. The Saudis have had four coaches in the last nine months. Such turnover is difficult to comprehend when you consider that the Saudis did not lose a match during qualifying. Solari, 52, took over in March.  STYLE The Saudis, like many Asian sides, have adopted the Brazilians' rhythmic, flowing game as a model. They construct, create and make the extra pass, relying on the wide-ranging attacking midfielders Saeed al-Oweiran and Khalid al-Muwallid to dictate the pace. The team used a 4-4-2 throughout qualifying and probably will not deviate because one coach was dismissed because of his desire to go with only three defenders. TOP PLAYERS The Saudis have a reasonable amount of talent, but they have only one national icon: Majed Abdullah, a 35-year-old striker from Jeddah who first joined the Saudi team in 1977 and has been selected more than 165 times for international matches. But Abdullah has grown fragile of late and missed most of the Asian World Cup qualifying tournament in October after injuring his knee. Even if he returns to form, the Saudis will need to look to their two creative, attacking midfielders, al-Oweiran and al-Muwallid, and to their two useful, young strikers, Sami al-Jaber (21) and Fahad al-Mehalel (23). With the exception of the 33-year-old captain, Mohammed Abdel Jawad, the Saudis are also young on defense. One player to watch is midfielder Fahad al-Herafi, a former star with the national team. OUTLOOK Saudi Arabia has succeeded in becoming a perennial soccer power in Asia. But Asia remains one of the world's weakest soccer regions, so don't expect to see the Saudis in the second round. An exceptionally young team, this will be the first time most of the Saudis play against world-class competition outside of a friendly. But the Saudis won't necessarily get blown out by superior opposition. They are skillful with the ball and unified after nearly a year of training exclusively together.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Sara Levine, Karan Bhatia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/style/weddings-sara-levine-karan-bhatia.html","abstract":"  Sara Levine, a daughter of Drs.

But how much, and how to do it? This guide to the problems and the main proposals before Congress was prepared by Diane Rowland and Peter Long of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a national health care philanthropy. PROBLEMS The Uninsured: 37 Million   Millions of Americans become uninsured each year, most of them because they do not get insurance on the job and cannot afford to buy it. In 1992, 37 million Americans -- 15 percent of the non-elderly population -- were uninsured on any given day. Because the elderly have Medicare coverage and the very poor and disabled generally have Medicaid, the overwhelming majority of the uninsured (84 percent) are full- or part-time workers and their families.   The high cost of insurance limits coverage. Seven in 10 uninsured Americans make less than $30,000 a year. Although the uninsured do get care, they get less, get it later and end up sicker than people with insurance. The Vulnerable   While most Americans have insurance, changing jobs can often mean losing coverage: two-thirds of companies with fewer than 25 employees do not offer coverage. In the course of a year, one in five Americans -- more than 50 million people -- will be uninsured at least temporarily and one-third will be without insurance for at least a year. Only 7 percent of uninsured adults say they are uninsured by choice. Six in 10 say they cannot afford coverage and 22 percent cite loss of a job or lack of on-the-job insurance. Three percent can't get coverage because of health problems. The Cost of Care   The U.S. is the only major industrial nation that does not provide universal health coverage, yet it spends far more than any other country on health -- more than $800 billion a year, 14 percent of the gross domestic product. And the portion is growing: without cost-containment measures, it is expected to top 18 percent by the year 2000. From 1988 to 1993, the average family premium for employer-based group health insurance doubled, from $2,500 to $5,200. Families wanting to buy health insurance directly from an insurer can spend as much as $10,000 a year. CHOICES Single-Payer   The single-payer plan would create a universal public system of health insurance coverage with comprehensive benefits financed by income and payroll taxes instead of premiums. All Americans would be covered, in much the same way the elderly are now covered by Medicare. Employerbased coverage, private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid would be replaced by a single plan. Costs would be controlled through administrative simplification and by a national budget with Government-regulated payment rates for doctors and hospitals. (Example: McDermott-/Wellstone bill.) Employer Mandate   Employer-based approaches build on the already extensive system that provides private insurance to two-thirds of the non-elderly population. To achieve universal coverage, all employers would have to offer insurance to employees and help pay the premiums. The Government would provide coverage or help pay for private insurance for nonworkers; Medicare would be kept for the elderly.   To contain costs, some plans would regulate prices and set spending limits; others would expand use of managed care, and promote increased competition among health insurance plans. Some plans call for regional alliances, which would spool the purchasing power of small business and promote price competition among plans. (Examples: Clinton plan, House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee bill.) Individual Mandate   This approach places the responsibility for obtaining coverage on individuals and families, rather than employers or the Government. To achieve universal coverage, people would be required to obtain insurance either through their employers or by buying it on the private market. The Government would subsidize premium costs for low-income individuals and families. Employers could cover some of the premium costs, but would not be required to.   Costs would be controlled by promoting increased consumer consciousness, greater use of managed care and greater competition among health plans. (Examples: Thomas-Chafee bill, Stearns-Nickles bill). No Mandate   Voluntary plans build on the existing system by providing incentives to expand coverage and control costs, but do not mandate coverage. Expanded coverage would be encouraged through reforms in the private health insurance market (Like eliminating ineligibility for those with pre-existing conditions), subsidies for low-income people and alliances to help small companies and individuals buy insurance.   This approach would control costs and make coverage more affordable by increasing competition among proivate insurance plans and cost consciousness among consumers. (Examples: Cooper-Breaux bill, Michel-Lott bill.) ASSESSING THE PLANS Single-Payer   All Americans would have comprehensive health benefits through a single system, regardless of income or employment. This approach would reduce much of the complexity of the present system, but it would shift most of the financing from employers and the private sector to the tax system. It would virtually eliminate a role for private insurance and would concentrate control of the health care system under the Federal Government. It would greatly expand the role of the Government in health, but also provide Government with greater purchasing power to control costs. Employer Mandate   Employer-based approaches expand insurance coverage with the least disruption to current arrangements and would minimize change for most Americans. They rely on employers to cover workers and on the Government to provide coverage for nonworkers. Employers and their employees, rather than the Government, pay most of the cost for insuring all workers and their families.   Employer mandates would mean higher health insurance costs for some businesses, especially small companies that do not offer insurance today. Government assistance to businesses could help avoid wage cuts, job losses and other potential effects.   The mobility of the work force makes this approach administratively complex and requires explicit mechanisms to assure continuous coverage. Cost control based on greater use of managed care and competition among health plans would require much restructuring of the market, without assured effectiveness. Individual Mandate   Making individuals responsible for insurance would break the link between employment and insurance coverage -- easing the mobility of the labor force, but also potentially removing business as a source of financing and a force in controlling costs.   Government subsidies could be directed to low-wage workers and low-income families rather than more broadly applied to businesses, but the loss of employer contributions would mean substantial tax increases for Federal subsidies to make insurance affordable, without adequate subsidies, coverage could remain beyond the reach of many Americans.   An individual-based program would substantially alter current insurance arrangements, and would be complicated to administer and hard to enforce. Increasing consumer awareness could help restain costs, but unless they join alliances, consumers would lack the purchasing power that big employers have now. No Mandate   Voluntary approaches provide incentives for cost control and for reaching the uninsured and the vulnerable, but no assurances that these problems will be fully addressed. Market reforms and expanded coverage for low-income people would reduce the number of uninsured but not assure universal coverage.   Expanded coverage of low-income people would require additional Federal revenue. Cost containment would depend largely on the success of free-market competition in restraining premium increases.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Picking The Best Broker","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/realestate/your-home-picking-the-best-broker.html","abstract":"  THE classic mistake too many sellers make when placing their homes on the market is to use a neighbor or friend as their real estate agent.

The Departments of Justice and Transportation are emphatic that the law also applies to cruise ships, \"a hybrid of a transportation service and a public accommodation.\" But applying it to ocean-going cruise vessels is more complex, because virtually all the 140 ships that call at United States ports are registered in foreign countries, and Government agencies point out that enforcement steps might conflict with treaties with the countries of registry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Germany, Thy Name Is Consistency","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/sports/world-cup-94-automatic-pressure-germany-thy-name-is-consistency.html","abstract":"  West Germany no longer exists.

BEST SHOWING Second round in 1990 FIRST ROUND Romania, June 18 in Pasadena, Calif; United States, June 22 in Pasadena; Switzerland, June 26 in Stanford, Calif. COACH Francisco (Pacho) Maturana, a dentist by profession, has transformed Colombia into one of the most entertaining sides in international soccer. A former player of the year in the Colombian domestic league, he coaches America de Cali, the team he guided to the 1992 Colombian title. STYLE One-touch passing, always attacking. TOP PLAYERS Forward Faustino Asprilla, forward Adolfo Valencia, midfielder Carlos Valderrama, midfielder Fredy Rincon, goalie Oscar Cordoba. OUTLOOK A darkhorse candidate to win the World Cup. Colombia thrashed Argentina, 5-0, in Buenos Aires during qualifying. Before losing to Bolivia, 1-0, in an exhibition in mid-April, Colombia had run its string of unbeaten games to 28. Valderrama injured a knee in February, and while his World Cup availability was initially uncertain, he has resumed playing impressively. Much will depend on how his knee holds up, for his passes are the soil from which so many goals flower. Flamboyant goalkeeper Rene Higuita, jailed last summer for accepting $50,000 to help arrange the release of a kidnap victim, was left off the team, but Cordoba has been a solid replacement, even if he doesn't stray from the goal mouth as far and as often as Higuita did. Asprilla is a spectacular player who punctuates his goals with a backflip. He is apparently a much better soccer player than a driver, given his penchant for auto accidents. He once left his car parked in an intersection for two days before retrieving it. Another time, he received nearly three dozen stitches in his leg after reportedly kicking in the window of a bus after a confrontation with the driver. Valencia helped Bayern Munich to Germany's Bundesliga title this season. Romania CUP APPEARANCES Five (1930, 1934, 1938, 1970, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to Ireland on penalty kicks in second round) BEST SHOWING Second round in 1990 FIRST ROUND Colombia, June 18 in Pasadena, Calif.; Switzerland, June 22 in Pontiac, Mich.; U.S.A., June 26 in Pasadena. COACH After a 5-2 loss during qualifying to the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks, Cornel Dinu was replaced by Anghel Iordanescu. Iordanescu had been coach of Steaua Bucharest, the army-supported team formerly run by the family of the executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. STYLE Latin, combination passing, flair for the spectacular. TOP PLAYERS Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, forward Ilie Dumitrescu, forward Florin Raducioiu, defender Gheorghe Popescu, defender Miodrag Belodedici. OUTLOOK Since the fall of Ceausescu, many of Romania's top players have become seasoned in Western European leagues. The fulcrum of the team is the tempestuous Hagi, the \"Maradona of the Carpathians,\" who has a temper to match his scoring ability. He recently served a two-game suspension for spitting at a player from Northern Island during an exhibition. If Hagi maintains his composure, this team could surprise a lot of people, advancing to the quarterfinals or beyond.The Romanians are concerned about their cross-country travel requirements during the eight-day first round. They played the United States twice recently, tying, 1-1, in 1993 and winning, 2-1, earlier this year. Dumitrescu scored all three goals for the Romanians. Iordanescu does not believe that this team possesses the individual talent of the 1990 World Cup team. The coach is especially concerned that Raducioiu, his one true striker, played sparingly this season with AC Milan. Romania can't afford to have a rusty trigger finger; Raducioiu scored seven goals in five World Cup qualifying matches. This team could give the Americans fits on the counterattack. Switzerland CUP APPEARANCES Six (1934, 1938, 1950, 1954, 1962, 1966) LAST CUP 1966 BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals, 1934 and 1938 FIRST ROUND United States, June 18 in Pontiac, Mich.; Romania, June 22 in Pontiac; Colombia, June 26 in Stanford, Calif. COACH Roy Hodgson, a Brit, took over a floundering national team and qualified the Swiss for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1966 with a victory and a tie against Italy. A charming man, Hodgson took a public relations beating for instituting a teamwide sex ban. Later, he said the celibacy requirement never existed; however wives and girlfriends will stay at a different hotel from the players and will be allowed to visit only after two of the three first-round games. Hodgson said he was less concerned about sex than he was about finding a place that will permit him to light up a cigar in the anti-smoking United States. As a player, Hodgson completed his career in South Africa, then spent more than a decade coaching in Sweden. He then moved to the Swiss club Neuchatel Xamax and in 1992, swapped jobs with Uli Stielike, a German who had become unnerved by the complacency of the national team in defeat. STYLE A 4-4-2 formation that combines individualism of Italian influence with resourcefulness and tight midfield of German approach. TOP PLAYERS Forwards Stephane Chapuisat and Adrian Knup, midfielders Ciraco Sforza, Georges Bregy and Alain Sutter, sweeper Alain Geiger. OUTLOOK None of the Swiss players have World Cup experience, the country's last appearance being 28 years ago. The opener against the Americans, to be played indoors at the Silverdome, in a humid, sticky environment before a pro-U.S.A. crowd, is critical. But Chapuisat and Knup have honed their scoring skills in Germany's Bundesliga. This season Chapuisat scored 16 goals for Borussia Dortmund, and he has a skill that many Americans lack: the ability to finish a play. Knup has scored 21 times in 31 appearances with the national team. Sforza and Bregy are the point guards in midfield, distributing the ball. Goalie Marco Pascolo suffered a knee injury three weeks before the start of the World Cup. At the World Cup draw in December in Las Vegas, Nev., Hodgson said that if his team played a mere 5 percent below its capability, it would not advance beyond the first round. United States CUP APPEARANCES Four (1930, 1934, 1950, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Semifinals in 1930 FIRST ROUND Switzerland, June 18 in Pontiac, Mich.; Colombia, June 22 in Pasadena, Calif.; Romania, June 26, in Pasadena COACH Known as the Miracle Worker, Bora Milutinovic coached Mexico to the quarterfinals in 1986 and Costa Rica to the second round in 1990. An eccentric coach, he is famous for his shrewd evasiveness.  STYLE Latin, lateral passing, control, possession game. TOP PLAYERS Midfielder Tab Ramos, midfielder Thomas Dooley, midfielder John Harkes, forward Ernie Stewart, forward Eric Wynalda, striker Roy Wegerle, goalkeeper Tony Meola. OUTLOOK If the foreign-based players can be assimilated in time, the United States can avoid becoming the first host country not to advance to the second round. Much depends on the first game against Switzerland. At least the Silverdome audience will be supportive, which may not be the case against Colombia and Romania at the Rose Bowl. A 1-0 victory over Mexico in the final exhibition was a confidence booster, especially since the crowd of 91,123 -- the largest ever to see the United States team play in this country -- was overwhelmingly pro-Mexico. But there are still kinks to be worked out. The United States built a modest 2-2-7 exhibition record against World Cup finalists, struggling to score goals and lapsing frequently on defense. The defense appeared much more cohesive against Mexico with Dooley playing at sweeper in place of Marcelo Balboa, who has not been the same since undergoing knee surgery in April 1993. Milutinovic has plenty of decisions to make: Start Stewart at striker, or opt for Frank Klopas, who has scored seven goals in his last nine games? Start Wynalda, or let him continue to kick-start the attack off the bench? Milutinovic must also find a place for John Harkes, who did not arrive until early June from the English League.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Pick-Me-Ups for Park's Fallen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-central-park-pick-me-ups-for-park-s-fallen.html","abstract":"  At 3:24 on a recent Sunday afternoon, the Central Park Medical Unit ambulance was cruising leisurely back to the park after dropping off an injured Rollerblade skater at Roosevelt Hospital.

The front-line duo of Romario and Bebeto symbolizes what Bebeto thinks is Brazil's edge over its opponents. \"Creativity,\" he said. \"We are a group of players capable of deciding a game in an individual play. And the coach will give us that freedom during the cup.\" The lightning-footed Romario is known for his outspokenness, and his refusal to accept sitting on the bench led to his suspension from the national team last year. Bebeto, a shy, frequently injured homebody, has great ball control around the penalty area and is known for his dangerous free kicks. OUTLOOK One of the favorites in the tournament despite being under pressure for failing since 1970, the year it won the tournament with what is considered the best team in the history of the World Cup. This team has no Pele or Rivelino or Zico or Gerson, but it has a plethora of talented players from defense to attack. They are good enough to restore Brazil's traditional attacking skills. Look for the squad to be one of the most entertaining and colorful teams. Cameroon CUP APPEARANCES Two (1982, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to England, 3-2, in quarterfinals) BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1990. FIRST ROUND Sweden, June 19 in Pasadena, Calif.; Brazil, June 24 in Stanford, Calif., and Russia, June 28 in Stanford. COACH Henri Michel, a likable Frenchman, in January became the fifth man to coach Cameroon since its heartwarming performance in Italy in 1990. Michel is no stranger to the Rose Bowl, where Cameroon will open against Sweden. It was there that the French team coached by Michel won the gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. Later, as coach of the national team, he led France to a third-place finish in the 1986 World Cup. STYLE They used a 4-4-2 four years ago and throughout qualifying, but Michel is leaning toward a 4-3-3 here. The system suits his open demeanor and the Indomitable Lions' surplus of talented strikers. Michel will probably let Francois Omam-Biyick, no longer a true center-forward, operate behind the front three. TOP PLAYERS Cameroon's best player is probably its angular forward Omam-Biyick, who has scored many important goals in nine years with the Lions. Their best-known player is Roger Milla, the 42-year-old striker who came out of retirement four years ago and scored four goals to lead Cameroon into the quarterfinals. Against the wishes of Michel and Omam-Biyick (but with the full support of the Cameroonian public), Milla has come out of retirement again. It remains to be seen whether Michel will play him, particularly since the Lions have no shortage of faster running mates for Omam-Biyik, including the explosive 23-year-old forward Alphonse Tchami. OUTLOOK Political infighting, poor management and financial difficulties turned the team's preparation into a farce. Michel got punched in the face by Jean-Claude Pagal after he learned he was not chosen for the team. With an unsettled mix of aging stars and inexperienced youngsters, and with a nasty group that includes Brazil, Sweden and Russia, the Indomitable Lions look incapable of making the second round. Russia CUP APPEARANCES Seven as the Soviet Union (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990). LAST CUP 1990 (1-2). BEST SHOWING Semifinals in 1966 FIRST ROUND Brazil, June 20 in Stanford, Calif.; Sweden, June 24 in Pontiac, Mich., and Cameroon, June 28 in Stanford. COACH Pavel Sadyrin, a 51-year-old Russian who took over the team after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, was successful player and coach at the club level. But late last year, 14 of his players called him \"incompetent\" and refused to play in the World Cup if he remained coach. The Russian federation backed Sadyrin and gave the players an ultimatum. The mutiny was not the first by a team coached by Sadyrin: he was dismissed at Zenit Leningrad after a player rebellion there in spite of winning a league title. STYLE Orthodox European style. They take a direct route from defense to attack primarily through the flanks with minimal lateral movement. TOP PLAYERS Sergei Yuran, a 24-year-old forward with Benfica of Portugal, is one of the finest prospects in the world and has scored seven internaional goals. Dmitry Kharine, a goalkeeper who plays for Chelsea in England was in goal for the gold-medal winning Soviet team in 1988. Dmitry Radchenko, a forward, who plays for Racing in Spain.  OUTLOOK This is country that has gone through perhaps more team adversity than any other in the tournament. It would be difficult to restore harmony after the coach went as far as calling the rebelling players traitors. Sadyrin doesn't have the service of four key players: winger Andrei Kanchelskis of Manchester United, forward Sergei Kiryakov of Karlsruhe in Germany, forward Igor Kolyvanov of Foggia in Italy and forward Igor Shalimov of Internazionale of Milan in Italy. This is a team that still has good individual players, but they lack cohesion, preparation because of the revolt and are in a difficult group. Don't look for them to get past the first round. Sweden CUP APPEARANCES Eight (1934, 1938, 1950, 1958, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Runner-up to Brazil in 1958 FIRST ROUND Cameroon, June 19 in Pasadena, Calif.; Russia, June 24 in Pontiac, Mich., and Brazil, June 28 in Pontiac. COACH Tommy Svensson, a 49-year-old Swede, who played for the national team 39 times, including the World Cup tournament in Mexico in 1970. He had coached four Swedish clubs and was coaching in Norway when he was asked to restore Swedish honor after the team finished 21st in Italy in 1990. STYLE Closer to the so-called English School that calls for long passes down the flank and crosses into the middle of the attack. TOP PLAYERS Tomas Brolin, who plays for Parma in the Italian League, has had a stormy relationship with the Swedish team and news media, and actually told Svensson he didn't want to play for his country. But he came back and scored three goals in the 5-0 victory in the qualifying game against Israel. Martin Dahlin, a forward with Borussia Monchengladbach of Germany, was Sweden's leading scorer during qualifying, with eight goals in the nine games. Another key player is Tomas Ravelli of Gothenburg, the 34-year-old goalkeeper. Klas Ingesson, a midfielder, injured his neck in a car crash earlier this month but is expected to be all right by the time the tournament starts. OUTLOOK Another team hampered by the fact that most players compete for clubs outside the country and don't play enough together. Lack of cohesiveness may be evident as a result. The presence of Brolin and Dahlin makes the Swedes dangerous offensively, and advancement past the first round is not farfetched.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Like, Cool Is Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/style/like-cool-is-back.html","abstract":"  If the philosopher Hegel was right and there really is a behind-the-scenes spirit animating the phenomenal world, it has got some explaining to do.

New American cooking dominates the new menu (as it did the old), but this time around there seems a greater emphasis on dishes with a Southwest accent. This worked best in a starter of herb-fried calamari (a heaping portion chock-full of crispy legs) with a coriander-mayonnaise dip, and a sharply spiced jabanero relish. Texas wild boar chili had fire and heat, with the smoky tang of moist, shredded pork, but the huge bowl of meat, with infinitesimal bits of corn, tomato and carrots simmered with it, became monotonous midway through.

That many will never get off the ground in their creations is almost beside the point.\n\nOtto Bishop, the president of one of 10 New Jersey chapters of the Experimental Aircraft Association, says that at least 70 people throughout the state are building full-scale airplanes in their homes.\n\n06-12-94 \"Take me, for instance,\" Mr. Bishop said. \"I have a two-car garage but both cars are out and it's taken over a room in the house. My wife will be so happy when I finish dragging those aluminum filings in and out.\" \n\nMr. Bishop, an electrical engineer, has worked 2,000 hours (the equivalent of 250 8-hour days) on his all-metal, single-engine two-seater. He expects to finish it in a year or so, he said. \n\nAlong with talent and the good nature of displaced family members, the essential element for most airplane builders is patience. It takes a long time to build a plane.\n\nAlbert (Frenchie) Arnaud, 79, has been working for more than 30 years on his 20-foot-long, 24-foot wing-span two-seater. He's up to 6,000 hours and still going.\n\n\"I'm a real cellar person who always wanted to build a plane,\" Mr. Arnaud said. \"This is a showpiece,\" he said, pointing to the gleaming aluminum structure. Mr. Bishop agreed, declaring Mr. Arnaud's plane of museum quality. \"My trouble is, I keep trying new things to improve it,\" Mr. Arnaud said. \"Now I'm designing a new intake manifold. The plane's 300 pounds overweight.\" \n\nBut Mr. Arnaud said that, what having had double bypass surgery, he didn't know whether he'd ever get to fly his plane. Mr. Bishop said that was a problem many builders faced. \n\n\"The project gets too big and some of them get older and lose their flying licenses for medical reasons so they never get in the air,\" he said. \n\nBuilding a personal airplane starts either by buying design plans or working from a kit. After the frame is completed and the engine and instruments are added, the cost is around $20,000. Most builders put in thousands more as they add things like radar equipment and computerized map displays, Mr. Bishop said. \n\nTechnicians in the club help prepare the plane for a Federal Aviation Authority inspection, checking the work for quality, looking for correct weight and balance, among other things. Then the authority inspects the aircraft. Planes built under the experimental classification must be tested for 40 hours by a licensed pilot; usually, but not always, the builder himself.\n\nAfter passing inspection, the plane is ready to be airborne. The pilot is now allowed to fly anywhere but is urged to stay away from congested areas. \n\nMr. Arnaud and Mr. Bishop are among 7 personal airplane builders out of 40 in the association who are building their own planes. Mr. Bishop said that others attend the monthly meetings in Nutley at the Italian-American Civic Center because they are interested in discussing aviation and they enjoy socializing with like-minded individuals. Every fall there is a fly-in at the Sussex Airport, where members get to show off their planes.\n\nMr. Bishop said it was a lot easier to seek help and to exchange parts within the club than to order them and then wait at least two weeks for parts to arrive from the West Coast, where most suppliers are based.\nMost Members Over 40\n\n The chapter is made up of men, most over 40, usually engineers and machinists who built model airplanes in their youth. \n\nMr. Arnaud, like other association members, enjoys working with tools. His basement is lined from floor to ceiling with jars holding screws and rivets of every size. \n\n\"I never even finished grammar school, but I can build anything from anything, wood, metal or cement,\" said Mr. Arnaud, a former tool design engineer for the Bendix Corporation. \"It just comes so easily to me. I built this home for my wife and I 47 years ago, and I did all the wiring, plumbing, concrete, everything from scratch.\" \n\nA motorcyclist for 62 years, Mr. Arnaud keeps busy operating a small basement machine shop for his clients. He works on motorcycles and racing cars and has built carburetor parts for a car that raced at Daytona this year. \n\nMr. Bishop said some club members get discouraged over the painstaking work that goes into building an airplane and some eventually give up. \n\n\"I'm sure there are thousands of plans sold to building enthusiasts that never ever become finished as aircraft,\" Mr. Bishop said. \"People ask me how can they spend so much time doing this, but I tell them that the years go by watching television too.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"The Angel of the Battlefield","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/books/the-angel-of-the-battlefield.html","abstract":"  A WOMAN OF VALOR Clara Barton and the Civil War.

Most of them did not vote for Bill Clinton and were against his plan for national health care. I can bet they are singing a different tune today. These women felt that people who could not find jobs were just lazy and wanted to stay home and collect welfare checks. These women all had the same question: \"Why did this happen to me?

Though stunned by the size of its premiums for individuals who are not part of a group plan, I knew it was essential for my peace of mind to have this extra protection.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Group D","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/sports/world-cup-94-the-teams-group-d.html","abstract":"  Argentina CUP APPEARANCES 10 (1930, 1934, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990). LAST CUP 1990 finalist (lost to Germany, 1-0) BEST SHOWING Champion in 1978 and 1986 FIRST ROUND Greece, June 21 in Foxboro, Mass.; Nigeria, June 25 in Foxboro; Bulgaria, June 30 in Dallas. COACH Alfio Basile, a 50-year-old Argentine nicknamed Coco. Unlike a great number of Argentines past and present, he has done all his playing and coaching in his native country. He coached his first game for the national team on Feb. 19, 1992. STYLE Typically Latin, with short passes and plenty of lateral movement. TOP PLAYERS Diego Maradona, the man without a team, who is gradually getting into the shape necessary to meet the rigors of the tournament. Gabriel Batistuta, a striker who plays for Fiorentina, has the potential to be a high scorer in the tournament. Diego Simeone, a midfielder who plays fo Seville in Spain. Claudio Caniggia, who is returning after a year's ban for drug abuse, can also be a key to the attack. OUTLOOK The strength of Diego Maradona's legs will decide how far the team goes beyond the first round. No one argues with Basile that Argentina is in a fairly easy group in the opening round and its advancement is virtually assured. Unfavorable results in warmup matches should not be taken seriously. Playing two first-round games in the Boston area, where the temperature is not expected to be as hot, is also to Argentina's advantage besides the relatively weak opponents. Bulgaria CUP APPEARANCES Five (1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986) LAST CUP 1986 BEST SHOWING Second round in 1986 FIRST ROUND Nigeria, June 21 in Dallas; Greece, June 26 in Chicago, and Argentina, June 30 in Dallas. COACH Dimitar Penev, a 48-year-old Bulgarian. He played 90 times for the national team, including in three World Cup tournaments, in 1966, 1970 and 1974. He took over as coach of the national team in the summer of 1990 and went without a defeat in his first six games. He is a man of few rounds and a master of tactics, as he proved in the elimination of France in the qualifying round. STYLE With most players competing for clubs in different countries, there is no concrete style. TOP PLAYERS Hristo Stoichkov, a forward with Barcelona and a fixture in the Spanish League for years, is the heart and soul of the team. Others to watch include Krasimir Balakov, a midfielder and the leading scorer for Sporting Lisbon, and Emil Kostadinov, a forward with Porto of Portugal who scored both goals on the final day of qualifying. Yordan Lechkov is Hamburg's rising star and the Bulgarians' key playmaker. Of the three goalkeepers, Borislav Mikhailov is considered the strongest. He had five shutouts in qualifying. The defensive unit is led by players from the home champion Levski Sofia -- Tsanko Tsvetanov, Emil Kremenliev, Zlatko Yankov and Petar Hubchev, who was sold recently by Levski to Hamburg SV. OUTLOOK They have trouble handling a skillful team that plays with speed. With Argentina and Nigeria, they have two of those types of teams in their group. What they have on their side is some experienced players and a coach who can make the right tactical move to win a game. A victory over Greece in their second game is a must if they are to advance. Greece CUP APPEARANCES This is the first. FIRST ROUND Argentina, June 21 in Foxboro, Mass.; Bulgaria, June 26 in Chicago; Nigeria, June 30 in Foxboro COACH Alketas (Alkis) Panagoulias, a 60-year-old Greek and a naturalized American citizen who has lived in the United States for 25 years. He originally came to the United States in 1962 to study for degrees in international relations and United Nations relations at the New York School for Social Studies. An accomplished player with Aris of Salonica, he is in his second stint as coach of the Greeks. He was the coach of the United States from 1983 to 1985. STYLE Direct up and down with little lateral movement and plenty of reliance on counterattacks. TOP PLAYERS Stelios Manolas, who is the captain of AEK in Athens, where he has played for 14 seasons, is the key to the defense. Tasos Mitropoulos of AEK, who at 36 is the Greeks' oldest player, is national team captain and the playmaker in midfield. He scored the tying goal, a header, against Russia in Moscow to give Greece its first-ever World Cup bid. Dimitris Saravakos of Panathinaikos is the most well-known forward. OUTLOOK Greece is the only nation in the tournament without a player competing for a club outside the country. The team has had some poor results in warm-up matches. Although Greece has the oldest team in the tournament in average age, lack of World Cup experience and mental toughness for the rigors of such a tournament is not on its side. What it does have on its side is strong fan support from the large Greek community and the fact the Greeks trained in the United States longer than any other team except Saudi Arabia. Nigeria CUP APPEARANCES This is the first. FIRST ROUND Bulgaria, June 21 in Dallas; Argentina, June 25 in Foxboro, Mass.; Greece, June 30 in Foxboro COACH In five years with the Super Eagles, Clemens Westerhof of the Netherlands has never lost an international match at home, and his coaching and organizational skills have unquestionably been a major factor in the team's rise. STYLE With their athleticism, strength and attacking bent, the Nigerians should be one of the most entertaining teams in the tournament. Their base 4-4-2 often becomes a 4-2-4 with four forwards: usually Emmanuel Amunike or Samson Siasia on the left wing, Rashidi Yekini and Daniel Amokachi in the center and George Finidi on the right wing. This works, in part, because Sunday Oliseh and others further back are capable of covering a lot of ground. The Super Eagles under Westerhof now rely less on the long ball and more on the short passing game, well-orchestrated by the playmaker Okocha. TOP PLAYERS Yekini is Nigeria's and Africa's star, a muscular striker with speed and power who has been the leading scorer in three different countries: Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Portugal. On defense, Westerhof has captain Stephen Keshi, Benedict Iroha and an imposing, experienced goalkeeper in Peter Rufai, who has competition in Wilfred Agbonavbare. OUTLOOK Westerhof says his team \"will be the surprise of the World Cup,\" but the truth is that Nigeria will not surprise any soccer buff by succeeding. The Eagles lost only one match in qualifying and have remarkable depth. The only question is defense, where the Nigerians suffered occasional lapses during the African Nation's Cup. If the Nigerians can play defense worthy of their offense, the quarterfinals just might not be the limit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"Apostles and Celibacy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/opinion/l-apostles-and-celibacy-379352.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The May 30 article in your series on the Roman Catholic Church states: \"Conservatives maintain that ordaining married men would be too drastic a departure from the tradition of the Roman church.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"What Was Grant Without Sherman?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/books/what-was-grant-without-sherman.html","abstract":"PARTNERS IN COMMAND\nThe Relationships Between Leaders in the Civil War.\nBy Joseph T.

Decade after decade, composers have fought for a personal, lasting voice amid the whirlwind of technical possibilities. In certain places, at certain times, they have faced a simpler and more desperate struggle to keep writing at all in the face of implacable cultural and political hostility. Twentieth-century music cannot be seen whole; it is a damaged thing, whose wishes and dreams count as much as its tangible accomplishments.   No period of recent history illustrates these contingencies more starkly and painfully than the era between the world wars. Music exploded in all possible directions: atonal modernism, tonal nostalgia, futurism, populism and satiric eclecticism. Soon the possibilities hardened into orthodoxies, whether of the Serialist, Neo-Classicist or socialist-realist kind. In the inferno of World War II, some younger composers had their confusion solved by death; most who survived spoke in distinctly less colorful tones. Greater waves of experimentation followed in the 1950's and 60's, but no era would again feel such unbounded freedom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"POSTINGS: Landmarks Preservation Commission Awards; 13 Projects Win Citations for Enhancing the Urban Environment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/realestate/postings-landmarks-preservation-commission-awards-13-projects-win-citations-for.html","abstract":"  The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission gave 13 awards last week for excellence of design, execution and craftsmanship, commitment to preserving the city's architectural heritage and contribution to the urban environment.

He promptly led them to qualification for the European Nations Cup of 1988 and the 1990 World Cup, where the Irish made the quarterfinals without winning a game (four ties) and despite scoring only two goals. In 1966, Charlton was a center-back for England's World Cup winning team, with his more famous brother, Bobby.\nSTYLE Hustle, hustle and more hustle. Ireland plays no fancy soccer -- the green-shirted guys harass the opponents, rag the ball and, when they win it, clobber long passes down the wings, then cross it into the middle, hoping an Irishman will head it in before someone else heads it out. Midfielders tend to think defense first, so Ireland's own half of the field is often packed when the opposition tries to penetrate.\nTOP PLAYERS About half of Ireland's squad is older than 30, including several key men: the goalkeeper, Packie Bonner (34); the team's best defender, Paul McGrath (34); midfielder Ray Houghton (32), and forwards Tony Cascarino (31) and John Aldridge (35). Bonner is Ireland's most-capped player, with 73 appearances for his nation since 1981. He's reliable, but has had trouble playing the ball out of danger with his feet (instead of scooping it up) as required under the new rule on back-passes from teammates. The versatile McGrath can play midfield or defense but will probably stay back, leaving leadership of Charlton's defense-minded midfield to Roy Keane, a 22-year-old who stars for Manchester United in the English top league, Houghton and Andy Townsend.\nOUTLOOK With 3 points for a first-round victory and 1 for a tie, the Irish will be out of luck if they play as they did in 1990. In such a tough group, with Italy and Mexico capable of scoring a few goals, and with heat and humidity taking a toll on older players, Ireland must make its defensive style produce victories this time.\nItaly\nCUP APPEARANCES 12, or every tournament except 1958\nLAST CUP 1990 (lost to Argentina on penalty kicks in the semifinals)\nBEST SHOWING Champions in 1934, 1938 and 1982\n\nFIRST ROUND Ireland, June 18 in East Rutherford, N.J.; Norway, June 23 in East Rutherford, and Mexico, June 28 in Washington\nCOACH Arrigo Sacchi took over the Italian national team in November 1991 after substantial success -- including two European Champions Cups and two World Club Championship Cups -- as head coach of AC Milan, one of European soccer's powerhouse clubs. Italian soccer had been stuck in a suffocating defensive style, and his Milan teams are sometimes credited with reviving energetic, attack-minded soccer (without abandoning rigid defense). Whether he'll be able to do the same with the Azzurri remains to be seen.\n\nSTYLE Sacchi expects his team to pressure almost constantly, which means the fullbacks often surge forward to join the attack, and the midfielders are on the ball as much as possible. He has players with the technical skills to win the ball often and to create dangerous opportunities often.\n\nTOP PLAYERS Italy has one of the world's best players in Roberto Baggio. The 27-year-old striker/attacking midfielder -- it's impossible to pin down his position, other than all-around creator -- plays for Juventus in the Italian league and was voted world player of the year for 1993. He has scored 19 goals for his country in only 33 games. Even when an opponent marks him man-to-man all match, Baggio has an uncanny ability to thread passes through a thicket of legs or squirm free himself, ball at his feet, for a brilliant shot or pass. Dino Baggio (no relation), a 22-year-old midfielder, scored the goal that beat Portugal in Italy's final qualifying match. Others to watch include Giuseppe Signori, who led the Italian first division with 23 goals last season; Daniele Massaro, an AC Milan forward, and Pierluigi Casiraghi. Italy has two other stars who could play for any team in the world: sweeper Franco Baresi and left fullback Paolo Maldini. Goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca rarely makes a mistake.\n\nOUTLOOK Italy must find other goal-scorers besides the Baggios. Most experts name Italy among the teams with good chances to win.\nMexico\nCUP APPEARANCES Nine (1930, 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1978, 1986) \nLAST CUP 1986 BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1970 and 1986, each time as host.\nFIRST ROUND Norway, June 19 in Washington; Ireland, June 24 in Orlando, Fla., and Italy, June 28 in Washington.\nCOACH A former pro in the Mexican league and a certified dentist, Miguel Meijia Baron was an assistant coach to Bora Milutinovic, now the United States coach, in 1986 when Mexico made it to the quarterfinals. Baron took over the top job in January 1993 and led Mexico to startling success -- not only did the Mexicans win five of six qualifying-round matches, but they made it to the finals of the 1993 Copa America, the South American championship, before losing, 2-1, to Argentina.\nSTYLE Skillful, fast, attractive. Mexico scored 17 goals in six qualifying-round games, but opposing defenses weren't high-caliber. Led by captain Ignacio Ambriz, Mexico has a veteran midfield and a solid, mobile defense corps that can join the attack readily.\nTOP PLAYERS Mexico's greatest player ever, the striker Hugo Sanchez, is hanging on for one last try at age 35 (36 on July 11) but a knee injury has thrown doubt over his prospects.  Other talented attackers include Luis Garcia, Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Roberto Alves, better known by his nickname of Zague. Zague (whose Brazilian father had the same nickname as a pro player) has a zigzagging style of play, with unusually deft dribbling skills taking him at an opposition defense from all angles, and a powerful left-footed shot finishing off the job. The Acapulco-born surfer Jorge Campos is regarded as one of the world's best goalkeepers, and one of the most unusual. Not just for his glaringly bright jerseys, but for his forays upfield -- he has been known to surge out and play as sweeper, even to go forward and shoot.\nOUTLOOK Mexico suffers by being in the toughest group but could surprise more favored Italy and is certainly capable of beating Ireland or Norway. Two big questions: whether the defense can hold up, and whether Mexico's adventurous style can be successful against veteran European teams in its group.\nNorway\nCUP APPEARANCES One (1938)\nBEST SHOWING First round, 1938\nFIRST ROUND Mexico, June 19 in Washington; Italy, June 23 in East Rutherford, N.J.; Ireland, June 28 in East Rutherford.\nCOACH Egil Olsen has been in charge since late 1990 and freely admits to copying the English style of play. He is credited with organizing a thorough, if boring, defensive style that enabled Norway to win its qualifying group handily, featuring a 2-0 defeat of England in Oslo and draws against England and Holland on the road.\nSTYLE To call Norway's style dull is probably charitable, but Olsen doesn't care. He insists all that matters is winning. His team mimics the English style of relentless running, rugged defense and, for offense, relying on a few long balls kicked way upfield in the hope of finding a scoring chance. Olsen also prides himself on producing what he calls the only team in the world with total zonal, and no man-to-man, defense. Whether zonal or not, it's certainly total; Norway usually plays a 4-5-1 formation, and the five midfielders are as likely to be playing defense as the four defenders.\nTOP PLAYERS Fittingly, most of Norway's regulars play their club soccer in England. Best known are the lanky, 6-foot-5-inch center-forward Jostein Flo, who plays for Sheffield United, and the goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, 31, who plays for Tottenham Hotspurs. Rune Bratseth, the team's 33-year-old sweeper and defensive anchor, plays for Werder Bremen in Germany and has helped that club win two league title and a Cup Winners Cup. \nOUTLOOK Norway could steal games by playing its total defense if Flo, Jan Age Fjortoft or Kjetil Rekdal can also steal a goal. But if the Norwegians' style forges too many ties, they will have trouble reaching the next round because victories are now worth 3 points. Norway and Ireland are similar; Italy should finish ahead of both. If Mexico can solve the defensive shells, it, too, might beat both.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"The View From: Scarsdale;\nWorld War II Veteran Who Became a Hero in Spite of Himself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/nyregion/the-view-from-scarsdale-world-war-ii-veteran-who-became-a-hero-in.html","abstract":"STANLEY A. FRANKEL of Scarsdale is not the average World War II hero. \n\nAs late as June 1940, he was publicly stating that the United States should not enter the fighting: as valedictorian of that year's graduating class of Northwestern University, he made a speech proclaiming that America should remain neutral. \n\n06-12-94 \"I felt betrayed by World War I,\" he remembered recently. \"That war was supposed to make the world safe for democracy. I felt all the deaths had been for nothing, literally for nothing.\" \n\nBut after graduating, moving to Manhattan and getting a job in publishing, Mr. Frankel was drafted.\n\nHe showed up at the draft board hoping to elude actual fighting by pointing out his bad eyesight. The recruiting officer in charge said, \"I'm sure we can find a spot for a semiblind soldier.\" \n\nEven in the Army, Mr. Frankel avoided active combat for a year and a half by editing a newsletter at Camp Shelby in Biloxi, Miss., and then at Army headquarters at the Grand Pacific Hotel in the Fiji Islands.\n\nAt this point, he was philosophically atuned to the United States' entering the war. The bombing of Pearl Harbor had made him realize \"that there was no other choice.\" But he still did not see himself as a fighting soldier. \n'I Felt Terror'\n\n \"I was living a great life in the Army, at the hotel on Fiji,\" he recalled. \"Then a friend told me that I was so smart, I should go to commissioned officers school and get promoted. My friend promised that when I graduated, in six weeks, he would send for me and I would come back and would do some type of desk work. At graduation, after they called my name, they called out, 'platoon leader, Company F.' \n\n\"I told the officer in command: 'Sir, there has been a mistake. I was supposed to go back to headquarters. I'd rather be a live sergeant than a dead colonel.' He said, 'I didn't hear that, or you would have been court-martialed.' For the first time as a soldier, I knew I had to go into the jungle with a gun. I felt terror. It was the lowest point of my life.\" \n\nMr. Frankel spent three and a half years fighting in the South Pacific. He saw friends blown to bits no more than a few feet from him.\n\nHe shot at enemy soldiers at close range. And he kept a diary of all that happened -- a diary he later turned into a book.\n\n\"Frankel-y Speaking About World War II in the South Pacific\" was published in 1992 by American-Stratford Graphic Services. Mr. Frankel had to cover publishing costs but felt it was worth it because he wanted to tell his story.\n\nA former magazine editor, publisher and political speech writer (his clients included Adlai E. Stevenson, Robert F. Kennedy and Walter Mondale), he felt the need to share his memories in print. \n\n\"Right now everyone is focusing on the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion,\" he said. \"But the war was not just fought in Europe; it was fought in the South Pacific as well, in jungles that were more like the terrain of Vietnam -- a war which, incidentally, I actively opposed. People lost their lives in the South Pacific; people's lives were changed by being there.\n\n\"Today people call me a very happy guy. They say: 'Stanley, you are 75 years old. You never complain. You are always cheerful and smiling.' I say: 'My God, look what I went through. I came out alive. Should I be mad at anything?' \" \n\nAmong his vivid memories of fighting in the Solomon Islands and in the Philippines are the nights. He wrote: \"Each soldier lies on his back with his jungle knife unsheathed in his clenched fist. The Yank sleeps, but his killer instinct is wide awake.\"\n\nAnd: \"They defend themselves with knives, bayonets, fists, rifle butts, teeth and religion. No one is to leave his hole. A moving object above ground is presumed to be an enemy. Knife him first and identify the corpse afterward.\" \n\nMr. Frankel spared no grizzly details: \"If you see the whites of their eyes, don't shoot; jab a bayonet into those eyes. They will scream and whistle or even call your name. They will fling firecrackers at you and chant, 'American, you die.' But make them come in after you. When they crawl around the ledge of your foxhole, they'll silhouette themselves against the sky. Then's the time to lunge upward with that jungle knife. Keep plunging and withdrawing the hilt until the flesh is death-cold. \n\n\"It was kill or be killed. You had a guy and a weapon against a guy and a weapon. Every damn night I said to myself, What am I doing here? What the hell am I doing here?\"\nJust a Matter of Luck\n\n The reluctant soldier rose through the ranks from basic private to major in the 148th Infantry Regiment of the 37th Ohio Infantry Division. His regiment won a Presidential unit citation for the capture of Manila; he received many individual medals and ribbons.\n\nThe fact that he was never wounded he attributes to luck. One of his most treasured possessions is a photograph of himself surrounded by three lieutenants and two sergeants in his platoon, taken Feb. 1, 1945, in Manila.\n\nTwo days later, he recalled, he and his comrades were \"sitting around a table in a Manila living room\" planning an upcoming river crossing. \n\n\"While we six were studying maps, barges, landing sites, etc., a Japanese shell lit on the table and exploded, driving us all back against the wall. I thought I was dead. I started feeling various parts of my body to make sure what was left. After 15 seconds, I yelled out, 'I haven't been hit.' But I was screaming to five dead men.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"I'm Insured -- I Think","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/opinion/im-insured-i-think.html","abstract":"The funny thing is, I did everthing right.\n\n After I quit my job eight years ago to make my living as a writer, my husband (also a writer) and I needed health insurance.

And nowhere is this spectacle more dramatic and enticing than in Yankee Stadium.    Yet fans stay away in droves, and every spring the same sour litany can be heard. Yankee management claims the stadium's South Bronx neighborhood is not safe, or that people believe it is not safe. The lament is then given a threatening turn by George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, who keeps talking about moving to New Jersey.

COACH From his bushy mustache to his diverse resume, Xabier Azkargorta stands apart from the rest of the World Cup coaching fraternity. A specialist in traumatic medicine, Azkargorta, a 40-year-old Basque, left his practice at the end of 1992 to take over the Bolivian team. The result was spectacular as the Bolivians qualified for the finals on their own for the first time in history. STYLE They often use a 5-4-1 (five defenders, four midfielders and one striker), but that does not mean they are defensive-minded. Their midfielders and outside defenders are very quick to counterattack, which helps explain how the team scored more goals (22) than any other in South America during qualifying. TOP PLAYERS Bolivia's strength is its midfield, which would have been considerably stronger if its star, 24-year-old Marco Etcheverry, weren't hampered by a knee injury. The Bolivians will be forced to rely more heavily on attacking midfielder Erwin (Platini) Sanchez of the Portuguese club Boavista. Sanchez, like his French namesake, is a remarkable passer and has a gift for free kicks. Julio Cesar Baldivieso, another midfielder, also bears watching, as does striker William Ramallo, who led the continent in scoring during qualifying with seven goals. OUTLOOK The bad news for the Bolivians is that Denver is not a World Cup site. They perform best in high altitude and won all four of their matches at home in La Paz, which lies at about 13,000 feet. But hyperventilating opponents do not explain all of Bolivia's success. The real explanation lies in a new generation of players and the inspirational influence of Azkargorta. The presence of Spain in the same group and uncertainty over Etcheverry mean the Bolivians are unlikely to see the second round. Germany CUP APPEARANCES 12 (1934, 1938, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990. East Germany in 1974) LAST CUP Champion in 1990 (beat Argentina, 1-0) BEST SHOWING Champion in 1954, 1974 and 1990 FIRST ROUND Bolivia, June 17 in Chicago; Spain, June 21 in Chicago, and South Korea, June 27 in Dallas. COACH Hubert (Berti) Vogts played in three World Cup finals (1970, 1974, 1978) for the national team and was named German player of the year in 1975 and 1979. He has spent his entire coaching career with the German Football Federation, working with juniors and as an assistant coach before replacing Franz Beckenbauer in 1990. STYLE Precise, relentless and remarkably cohesive. Lothar Matthaus should prove a more versatile sweeper than Thomas Berthold, who started against Argentina four years ago. The continuing brilliance of Thomas Hassler and the rise of Stefan Effenberg, Matthias Sammer and Andreas Moller guarantee that the Germans will remain aggressive in midfield. TOP PLAYERS At 33, Mat thaus is no longer the dominant creative force of 1990, but the captain remains a cut above his peers as he prepares for his fourth cup appearance. Nine of the 11 players who started in the 1990 final are back, including Bodo Illgner, Jurgen Klinsmann, Rudi Voller, Hassler and Andreas Brehme. The best of the new crop: Effenberg, Sammer and Moller. OUTLOOK Germany has played more matches (68) in the cup finals than any other nation; there's no reason to believe it won't get to play 7 more this year. Beckenbauer's inspirational qualities will be missed, but the Germans are poised and talented enough to inspire themselves. South Korea CUP APPEARANCES Three (1954, 1986, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Never past the first round FIRST ROUND Spain, June 17 in Dallas; Bolivia, June 23 in Foxboro, Mass.; Germany, June 27 in Dallas. COACH Despite seven years as a defender with the South Korean national team, Kim Ho never made it to the World Cup finals as a player. Ho, 49, started his coaching career in 1979 as an assistant with the national under-19 team, where he helped develop many of the players on South Korea's 1986 and 1990 cup teams. He became coach of the national team in September 1992. STYLE South Korea is a dangerous counterattacking team that, against Asian competition, likes to penetrate up the wings, particularly the right side where Noh Jung Yoon is faster and more powerful than most who mark him. TOP PLAYERS The attacking midfielder Kim Joo Sung, the only South Korean playing in Europe, has the biggest reputation. A former Asian player of the year, he started for South Korea in the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals and adopted the nickname Sampson because of his long hair that he said gave him strength and courage. But he was overshadowed during qualifying by another attacking midfielder, Noh Jung Yoon, a compact and swift technician who usually operates on the right wing. The South Koreans also may have the best goalkeeper in Asia in Choi In Young and a midfielder who was sensational in Qatar in Shin Hong Gi. OUTLOOK The first Asian team to play in four World Cup finals does not have an illustrious past from which to draw confidence. In eight previous matches against the globe's best, the South Koreans have managed only one tie and have been outscored, 29-5. Ho's goal is the second round, and such ambition is admirable. Spain CUP APPEARANCES Eight (1934, 1950, 1962, 1966, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (Lost to Yugoslavia, 2-1 in second round) BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1934 and 1986 FIRST ROUND South Korea, June 17 in Dallas; Germany, June 21 in Chicago, and Bolivia, June 27 in Chicago. COACH Outspoken and combative, Javier Clemente has been directing the national team for less than two years and has reshaped it profoundly, phasing out such high-profile World Cup veterans as Michel and Emilio Butragueno and opting for youth and solidarity in the form of nine players from Spain's best club, FC Barcelona.   STYLE The Spaniards are very versatile, with many players capable of doing damage. They are so versatile that Clemente has been criticized for not developing a true playmaker. Unless midfielder Julen Guerrero emerges, the creating will be left largely to Jose Maria Bakero, who plays behind the front line in the 4-4-2 and, like many of the Spaniards, is extremely dangerous with his head. TOP PLAYERS Among the best are striker Julio Salinas, midfielders Josep Guardiola and Bakero, defenders Albert Ferrer and Miguel Angel Nadal and the venerable goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta, one of the rare holdovers from the 1990 cup team. Zubizarreta will have to miss the opening game, however, after being suspended early in the first half of Spain's decisive qualifying match against Denmark.   OUTLOOK With Spain's depth, skill and weak first-round opposition (Germany, of course, excepted), it should be a lock for the second round and just might make it go the semifinal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"If You're Thinking of Living In/Sutton Place; A Riverside Enclave for the Well-to-Do","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/realestate/if-you-re-thinking-living-sutton-place-riverside-enclave-for-well.html","abstract":"  BREEZES off the East River cool the gentry on Sutton Place and push the heat waves from the clean, nearly empty street that runs south from the Queensboro Bridge to the exit of the Franklin D.

Picturesque villages, medieval castles and major shrines on the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrim's road to Santiago de Compostela, grace this former kingdom (From 1234 to 1512 Navarre included part of southern France), and a recently developed network of private lodgings makes travel there downright cheap.\n\nMany of the family homes in Navarre offering bed and breakfast for under $15 a night, called casas rurales, are situated in unspoiled villages in the heart of the Pyrenees. To stimulate the regional economy, once dependent on timber, sheep and handicrafts, the Navarrese provincial government made loans to villagers willing to renovate their homes to accommodate tourists, mostly Spaniards, who come here for skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, cycling, fishing and hunting.\n\nSome casas rurales offer home-cooked meals, usually accompanied by one of Navarre's first-rate rosados, or sturdy red wines, for $7 to $10. The Navarrese are noteworthy cooks and many families grow their own vegetables and make sheep's milk cheese and cuajada (a delicious yogurtlike dessert). Even if meals aren't offered, most Pyrenean towns have simple restaurants serving such typical dishes as esparragos blancos (white asparagus), alubias (bean stew), pimientos rellenos (stuffed peppers), revueltos (eggs scrambled with mushrooms, green garlic shoots, shrimp, etc.), fresh trucha (trout), costillas de cordero (lamb chops) and cuajada. In sping and autumn, there are dishes with exceptional native mushrooms. I decided to begin my three-day trip to Navarre last spring with a nostalgic drive from Madrid to Burguete, a favorite place from previous trips. I would stay at a casa rural in Ochagavia, explore the Salazar Valley the next day, and end up in Roncal the next night.\n\nThe Camino de Santiago crosses the French border north of Burguete and winds through the hills above Roncesvalles, where Charlemagne's nephew Roland was immortalized in the epic poem \"Chanson de Roland.\" These mystical woods are imbued with the spirit of Roland and the Santiago de Compostela-bound pilgrims who passed this way. The restored 12th-century Roncesvalies monastery was once a proud pilgrim's hospice, known for its good food, real beds and its cobbler.\n\nBecause I wanted to reach Ochagavia before nightfall, I could spend just a few moments in Burguete -- stopping for coffee at a bar across the street from Hostal Burguete, which hasn't changed much since the 1920's, when Hemingway stayed there. In \"The Sun Also Rises,\" Jack Barnes and Bill Gorton went to Burguete to fish the Irati, a good hike east. The hostal's owners say the piano, which has \"E. Hemingway\" (sic) scratched under the lid, is the one in the novel.\n\nDriving on from Burguete through the rocky forests, I passed pretty, bucolic Garalda; Arrive, with its fine medieval bridge over the Irati, and Garayoa with a 13th-century Gothic church. High escarpments tower above the roads to the Abaurrea pass (3,320 feet), where I got a first glimpse of the snow-capped Pyrenean peaks, now suffused with a lovely peach glow from the setting sun. A series of hairpin turns would down a steep valley past Ezcaroz on the swift Salazar River just below Ochagavia, the valley's main town.\n\nOchagavia is a charming mountain-bound village of just under 800 inhabitants laid out along two sizable streams that form the Salazar at the town's southern outskirts. A passer-by showed me to Casa Osaba, a big stone house on a cobbled street. Gabriela Moso, the owner, led me up two flights to a plank-floored bedroom that had a big bed with warm coverlets, an armoire, and a night stand with the obligatory dim-bulbed lamp; down the hall was a new bathroom with plenty of hot water. In the family's modestly furnished second-floor dining room with a fireplace, was a herrada, a gleaming brass-and-steel, megaphone-shaped water vessel -- a unique piece of folk art. Gabriela invited one for dinner at 10 P.M.\n\nI took advantage of the remaining night to explore Ochagavia. Most of the houses are two-and three-story stone homes with white facades, tiled roofs, shuttered windows and flower-filled, wrought-iron balconies. The dates -- 1768, 1908 and 1926 -- on the arched stone portals above stout wooden doors, speak to their durability. The rough streets are hand-paved with river stones, requiring sturdy footwear. Across a stone bridge I found Pension Aunamendi, whose restaurant offers an inexpensive menu, but alas, no tapas at the bar. As I returned to Casa Osaba, wood smoke curling from the village's chimneys sharpened my hunger. I hoped Gabriela was a cook worthy of Navarre's reputation.\n\nIn the dining room I met Gabriel's family: her husband, daughter, grandson, and her son-in-law, who tends a large herd of sheep near Tudela. (Some proficiency in Spanish is necessary to get the most out of family dining situations such as this one.) In front of the cracking fire, Gabriela served a fine salad with white asparagus; garlicky green beans and potatoes; merluza rebozada (Hake in batter); fireplace-grilled pork chops; fresh cherries, and a good rosado.\n\nAfter dinner there was coffee and homemade pacharan, Navarre's sole berry-anise liqueur. After a chat about life in America, I went to bed, gave up reading in the dim light and slept soundly until morning. Breakfast was toast, butter and homemade plum jam; galletas, or snap cookies, and coffee. Bed and breakfast was about $12.\n\nFrom Ochagavia I followed the Salazar south through forests punctuated by striking cliffs and rock formation. Ancient stone houses, block-tower churches and cobbled streets give this valley's 15 villages a medieval air. Below Ezparza, a picturesque village with a Romanesque bridge, a 16th century church, and a trout farm, the road winds through spectacular gorges. Occasionally, a falcon soared overhead. Fields of poppies lined the road to Navascues, where I stopped to see the 12th-century Romanesque Santa Maria del Campo church, which stands in ancient solitude alongside the village cemetery southwest town. North of Navascues, the Roncal road curves up steep, craggy hills to Las Coronas pass (3,120 feet), where there is a splendid vista of the Roncal Valley.\n\nNine more miles of twisting roads brought me to Burgui, a dramatic town with a Romanesque bridge and a breathtaking canyon to its south. Along the river banks I saw almadias (Log rafts) used by almadieros, who re-enact the dangerous feats when, before trucking and a downriver dam was built, daring loggers rode rafts down the swolled river to the sawmills each spring. At Burgui the road joins the Pamplona-to-Roncal highway, following the Esca River through more precipitous gorges with waterfalls and suspension bridges linking trails over the river.\n\nAt Roncal's southern edge, on a hill overlooking the town, I found Casa Indiano, the charming two-story fieldstone home of Ana Maria Donazar, a grandmother who dotes, with equal amount of loving care, on her young grandson and her casa's rustic pinetimbered interior. The living quarters, including a kitchen with spectacular valley views, were on the second floor. Mrs. Donazar put me in a small room with a double bed, just across from a clean, modern bathroom.\n\nThe Roncal Valley is famous for its colorful folklore and its cheese. In early July the Roncalese dress in regiona costumes for a romeria (Pilgrimage cum picnic) at the hermitage of Idoya near Isaba. On July 13, Roncal Valley's seven mayors turn out in typical costumes for the \"Tribute of the Three Cows\" offered by their French neighbors from Bearn. This annual event dates from the Middle Ages and draws thousands to a site near the border.\n\nRoncal's renowned sheep's cheese, queso Roncal, reminiscent of Italian Parmesan, but milder and softer, was the first Spanish cheese granted a denominacion de origen (Like that for wine). Once an artisanal cheese, queso Roncal today is mostly made in a local factory.\n\nRocal's houses are of the same stout construction as Ochagaviea's but of more distinctive architecture. Like most towns here, its interior streets are paved with river stones. The home of the Roncalese tenor Julian Gayarre (1844 to 1890), the greatest Spanish opera singer of his time, is now a museum displaying mementos from his illustrious career. At Roncal's northern edge, the Esca runs by a trout farm acrosss from a park with picnic tables and fine views of the town's massive church.\n\nFor lunch, near Casa Indiano, I found Restaurante Begona, a small cafe overlooking the Esca. On the wall was a photograph of Roncal's trout fishing champion, a man wearing a huge Basque beret. When I asked for trout, Begona, who answers the noisy telephone, waits on tables and cooks, told me, \"You have to call ahead.\" I opted for salad, red bean and chorizo stew, revueltos con ajos y gambas (eggs with garlic shoots and shrimp), and queso Roncal. When I ordered a bottle of rosado, Begona handed me the corkscrew. Lunch was $10.\n\nNorth of Roncal is Isaba, an attractive village in a lush valley below the rugged gray-tone peaks that poke through the surrounding forests like giant teeth and culminate the Mesa de los Tres Reyes, Navarra's highest mountain at 7,984 feet. Saving a tour of Isaba for evening, I head north toward the mountains. On the way I saw fishmen working the Belagua, a stream criss-crossed by rustic stone bridges. On the plain below herds of sheep grazed and mares nursed wobbly-legged foals. Signs on farmhouses offered homemade cheeses.\n\nBeyond the plain the road climbed steeply for several miles to the heights of Belagua overlooking the valley. Halfway up the mountain at the Venta de Juan Pito, one can lunch on migas (Bread fried with oil and garlic) and grilled lamb chops by a big fireplace in the rustic dining room. The nearby Belagua ski refuge has spectacular cross-county and downhill trails, but no lifts. The road climbed through increasingly rugged terrain, where intensely blue wildflowers grew in striking juxtaposition to the rocks and snow. Finally, the road ran through a snow-lined pass with splendid views of France.\n\nThat evening I strolled through Isaba, admiring the streets and houses that seem to be made of the same rectangular stones, the flowerfestooned balconies and arched doorways. Since Roncal has few placed to eat, I dined in Isaba at Hostal Lola's popular restaurant, where peppers stuffed with bacalao, trout with ham, cuajada, a good rosado and coffee came to about $20. Back in Roncal I found a lively bar for a pacharan nightcap. A sign on th wall said \"If bullfighting is art, cannibalism is gastronomy.\"\n\nThe next morning at Casa Indiano Mrs. Donazar and her husband, with the \"help\" of their grandson, Xavier, gave me a breakfast of cafe con leche, pan tostado with homemade jam and galletas. I paid my bill (about $14 with breakfast) and reluctantly began the daylong ride out of these splendid mountains to Madrid.\n\nThe little boy and his grandmother waved goodbye from an upstairs window.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"A Closer Look on Wiretapping","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/opinion/a-closer-look-on-wiretapping.html","abstract":"  The Government's ability to tap private phone calls is under siege.

And digital technology -- from cellular phones to call-forwarding -- makes wiretapping increasingly difficult.    The Clinton Administration is running scared and proposes two fixes, neither satisfactory. Government needs to wiretap under legally restricted circumstances. Though used sparingly during the 1980's (1,000 a year), taps helped convict more than 20,000 felons. But before tampering with existing arrangements, the Administration must show that its proposals are workable and will not trample on existing rights to conduct private phone conversations.

In the past, the likes of Joan Miro, Antoni Tapies, Alberto Burri and Annie Leibovitz have done World Cup posters\nWHY PETER MAX? \"We wanted an American artist, but one who was internationally known,\" said Jeff Bliss, the senior vice president for marketing for World Cup '94. \"A popular artist who would appeal to more than a specific niche.\" From a dozen possibilities, it came down to Mr. Max, who proved to be \"the best fit,\" Mr. Bliss said. And Mr. Max is a global guy -- born in Germany in 1937 and raised in China, Israel, France and then Brooklyn. He's also an old hand when it comes to posters: this year alone he was commissioned to create posters for Super Bowl XXVIII, the Grammy Awards and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival\nTHE MAX SPIN: Mr. Max has always had a predilection for the celestial -- he has even given his children the nicknames Astro and Cosmo -- so it's not surprising that he has put a spacey spin on this design. It shows a soccer player suspended in the stratosphere, hovering over the United States, whose shape has been filled in with the stars and stripes (two stars, six stripes). There is a heart, too, -- because, Mr. Max said, \"America still has a big heart.\" Nothing's left to the imagination.\n\n\"It's very Peter Max,\" the artist said. That's probably the best way to put it. Very splashy, very North American Soccer League. Its bright yellow, red and oranges will make you shield your eyes at times. And cover your ears: it's loud. What's the patronizing word the British use to describe the American sports-hype machine? -- razzmatazz\nWHERE: Right now, the original is at Mr. Max's gallery, called Viamax, in New York. Soon it will be shipped off to the headquarters of FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in Zurich, perhaps to be auctioned off for charity. The poster, which will sell for $14.95, will be available later this month at all World Cup stadiums and at retail stores across the country. The World Cup organization itself is accepting phone orders ($14.95, plus $6 postage and handling) at (800) 827-2270. \nPREDECESSORS: The most lavish poster campaign by far was for the matches in Spain in 1982, which was also one of the quirkiest World Cups in recent memory. Miro, in his unmistakable whimsical style, put forth the sumptuous design called \"La Fiesta,\" a surreal something-or-other in brilliant reds and yellows -- the colors of Spain. There were also separate posters created for each of the 14 Spanish cities in which the games were played. For Barcelona, Mr. Tapies, who is also fervent Catalonian nationalist, created a defiant, exultant graffiti-scrawled design.\n\nAnnie Leibovitz, too? Sure. For the 1986 World Cup, in Mexico, the renowned photographer produced 12 enigmatic photographic posters, including one for each of the cities where games took place. The poster for Mexico City, showing just the mysterious shadow of a futbolista against Toltec ruins, was chosen as the flagship.\n\nEach World Cup since the first one, in 1930, has produced something memorable. The poster for the first World Cup, in Uruguay, was, predictably, high Art Deco; the deadpan Mexico 1970 poster simply showed a deconstructed soccer ball against a matte purple background; Chile's ethereal poster from 1962 shows a soccer ball orbiting the earth, making it an austere precursor to Mr. Max's design; Argentina 1978 produced a pointillistic photomontage; and World Cup Willie, the ball-kicking lion, starred on England's quaint 1966 offering. \nONLY IN AMERICA: Take another look at Max's soccer player. He (or she for that matter, if you don't look too closely) is faceless, raceless.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940612","headline":"New Jersey Q & A: Dr. Mary S.

The paradox of our current situation, however, is that unless we address such basic, almost existential questions, we stand little chance of solving our nation's health care

Using a 1992 higher education law, the Department of Education is about to enforce new rules that aim to make institutions more accountable for the student aid funds they receive.   The new rules are making some institutions nervous, especially colleges that fear intrusive regulation even though their students have a solid history of prompt repayment. The Government is right to protect its investment more aggressively, but it must be careful not to impose undue burdens on schools with good track records -- or on schools that take calculated risks on poor students. Both the Administration and Congress need to monitor this reform closely and, if it starts to harm worthy institutions, step in to refine it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940614","headline":"Investing in a Temporary Bargain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/14/science/peripherals-investing-in-a-temporary-bargain.html","abstract":"  WITH Apple Computer Inc. switching to a new family of processors, the reduced instruction set chips (RISC) of the Power Macs, this seems an odd time to buy one of the older Macintoshes.

Mr. Dylan's generation is represented elsewhere on the roster of Woodstock '94: the Latin-rock group Santana and the rock-folk trio Crosby, Stills and Nash, both at the first Woodstock, are also scheduled to perform. But this Woodstock is being heavily marketed toward teen-agers and 20-somethings. The two-day show, scheduled for Aug. 13 and 14, will be dominated by acts who came of age long after 1969, including Nine Inch Nails, Arrested Development, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Porno for Pyros and Spin Doctors.

But existing designs require crystals of very high quality, or the electrons that are knocked loose by sunlight are diverted by impurities or flaws in the crystal before they can be gathered into current.
