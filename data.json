Discarding their civilized ways, the Inquisitor charged, these women had indulged in the drinking of chocolate and, under its influence, had consorted with the Devil himself. This accusation surprised no one, for the dark, mysteriously seductive drink of the cocoa plant had been famous since the time of the Aztecs as a powerful incantatory tool.\n\nTo some modern sensibilities, attributing such power to chocolate may seem ridiculous. But in a few days, untold numbers of Americans will observe Valentine's Day by presenting a symbol of their love in the form of -- what else? -- chocolates. When they do, they will be paying unwitting homage to the power of food as magic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"1945: Big Three Meet : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/opinion/IHT-1945-big-three-meet-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Josef Stalin announced from their secret meeting place in the Black Sea area tonight [Feb. 7] that they have agreed on plans for the final defeat of Germany and they are now discus","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"Walters Upset By 'Selfish' Anderson","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/sports/pro-basketball-walters-upset-by-selfish-anderson.html","abstract":"  He is either One Angry Man or One Disenchanted Dude, depending on the source.

They had a simple request: Could Mr. Rabin make an exception and let their Palestinian workers into Israel so they could operate the family's factory? Otherwise the whole family couldn't go to their son's funeral. Mr. Rabin made the exception, but he later told friends the request sent a chill down his spine, because it drove home to him just how tragically intertwined Israel and the Palestinians had become.   Mr. Rabin has decided to do something about that. He has already brought in 12,000 Thai workers to replace Palestinians, and he wants even more. But there is a real danger that violence is going to drive Israel to separate from the Palestinians, before the Palestinian economy can stand on its own. With Israelis having a per capita income of $14,000 per annum and Gazans $1,400, such a premature separation would be a recipe for explosion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"Despite Bitter Cold, Many Homeless Resist the Shelters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/nyregion/despite-bitter-cold-many-homeless-resist-the-shelters.html","abstract":"  Tony Ruelas was stretched across several seats in the last car of a Q train yesterday afternoon.

All you have to do, these experts concluded, is to incorporate a total of about 30 minutes a day of moderate activity into your routines. That means actions like taking stairs instead of elevators and escalators, walking short distances instead of driving door to door, gardening, raking leaves, doing housework, dancing, playing actively with children or pets, riding a stationary bicycle while watching the evening news, playing golf without a cart or doing any other activities at the intensity of a brisk walk for however long you choose -- as long as you log a total of 30 minutes a day.

the circuit of blues bars and rock clubs, all the way to a major-label contract and an album, \"Relish\" (Mercury), to be released in late March. Her voice, full of raw-throated emotion and bluesy finesse, helped propel her. But unlike many good-timey singers around the country, Ms. Osborne has more to offer than party anthems. At the Mercury Lounge on Tuesday night, she and a new band previewed her new album, in a set of remarkable songs that contemplate sex and faith, despair and trust, pleasure and loss.   Ms. Osborne's songs carry the essentials of roots rock -- blues riffs, soul vamps, a folky twang -- into a modern urban setting. She has plenty of vocal technique, from Bonnie Raitt's blues turns to Balkan glottal stops, but she uses it to illuminate the songs, not to show off. In \"St. Teresa,\" she had a hoarse, ravaged voice to sing about a drug-addicted prostitute; she was sweetly comforting in \"Crazy Baby,\" pleading with a depressed friend not to commit suicide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Davis Hopes Practice Routines Will Leave Jitters Behind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/sports/figure-skating-davis-hopes-practice-routines-will-leave-jitters-behind.html","abstract":"  His stomach churning triple axels, his confidence spiraling into a death-drop spin, his nerves turning to slush, Scott Davis has resorted to an extreme cure for his stage fright -- virtual reality.

The mice seem fine when they are young but, starting in middle age, the areas of the animals' brains involved in learning and memory became riddled with plaque, the characteristic Brillo-like balls of protein that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nerve cells in the mice degenerated in these areas of the brain just as they do in Alzheimer's patients.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Some Familiar Faces Return to Power in Panama","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/world/some-familiar-faces-return-to-power-in-panama.html","abstract":"  Ernesto Perez Balladares took office here last September promising to \"close the Noriega chapter\" of Panamanian history.

The message is clear: the Democratic Revolutionary Party, founded by Gen.

Perry and his proposed $258 billion spending plan a chilly reception, a senior Democrat, Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, was abandoning the Clinton Administration proposal and putting forward his own version that would increase military spending by $44 billion through 1999.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950209","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/style/chronicle-547395.html","abstract":"  Who owns the right to write about JERRY SEINFELD?

Where did this mysterious woman Melisande come from? Why is she so unhappy after he marries her? What is she up to with Pelleas, his half-brother? And finally, was their love innocent or guilty?   Mr. Sellars, opera's now mature enfant terrible, insists on providing all the answers, with a vengeance. This production, first seen at the Netherlands Opera in 1993, denudes Debussy of ambiguity and mist and symbol. Gone are the castle, the fountain, the linden tree and the imaginary kingdom of Maurice Maeterlinck's play. In their place, George Tsypin, the set designer, has provided a 20th-century Malibu beach house jutting out from a cliff, with cutaway rooms. There is no dusk or dawn, just shifting glares from James F. Ingalls's' fluorescent lighting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Pressure On NATO To Expand","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/world/pressure-on-nato-to-expand.html","abstract":"  Willy Claes, the new Secretary General of NATO, a sometime music conductor, is struggling to keep his multinational group in tune as NATO seeks to expand despite its concerns over Russia's military operation in Chechnya.

But no longer. Indeed, President Clinton must have envied those days as he searched for someone to take the job overseeing a troubled Central Intelligence Agency and a constellation of other espionage organizations, all becalmed in the aftermath of the cold war. Several good candidates turned down the daunting but essential business of overhauling the intelligence services and their $28 billion annual budget.   The man who ultimately accepted, Michael Carns, a retired Air Force general, is a sound choice, with the potential to be a distinguished one. General Carns, who served as vice chief of staff for the Air Force and is a graduate of Harvard Business School, brings extensive management experience to the job.

Of course the chief blame for this debacle lies with the White House, which once again put forth a nominee without adequately vetting the person's background or knowing the answers to potentially explosive questions. As a result, the Administration put out false information on the number of abortions performed by Dr. Foster. In this as in earlier episodes, White House bungling makes it difficult for President Clinton's natural allies to support him fully.

Ideally, their works are contemplated in the same way. But that is not how they are thrust upon an unsuspecting world. In late-20th-century New York, art takes its first bow in a room as loud and crowded as a commodities trading pit and as smoke-filled as an off-track betting parlor. The fruits of genius are toasted with Chilean chardonnay and honored with offerings of suspect cheese. For a mad two hours, artists, critics, hangers-on, insiders, befuddled outsiders and outright scroungers mingle, collide, preen, dish, fawn, toady, snub and, as a last resort, take a fleeting glance at the art on the wall.    This ritual, played out hundreds of nights a year in galleries great and small, uptown and downtown, is known as an art opening.

William Fulbright for leadership has passed into middle age, and now the former Arkansas Senator is gone at age 89. His opposition to the wasteful and unjust war in Vietnam led him to confront another old lion of the Senate, Lyndon B. Johnson, who had moved into the White House and seemingly taken leave of his senses. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Fulbright defied first Mr. Johnson and later President Nixon for the mad prosecution of a war that had no importance to the nation's survival.   Among those who remember those fraught days, Mr. Fulbright will long be venerated for these acts of unmitigated political courage; they crowned his career.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950210","headline":"Behind Arrest of Bomb Fugitive, Informer's Tip, Then Fast Action","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/10/nyregion/behind-arrest-of-bomb-fugitive-informer-s-tip-then-fast-action.html","abstract":"  For two years, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, No. 1 on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list and the man the authorities consider the main plotter behind the bombing at the World Trade Center two years ago, was the target of an international manhunt spanning several countries and thousands of miles.
