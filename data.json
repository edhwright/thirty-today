You're too smart not to use it.\" Innocuous, right? Not to local broadcasters. All of them turned the ad down. \"This is . . . the sort of subject matter some portion of our audience would consider intrusive into their moral or religious beliefs\" was a typical response -- and the commercial was shown only in the Buffalo area.   Seven years later, viewers of four major TV networks and several cable networks can see a condom leap from a chest of drawers just as a couple -- genders unspecified -- are about to make love. They can see a woman and a man, rapidly undressing and half out of breath, and hear the woman's cool rejoinder when, in answer to her question, the man confesses to having forgotten protection. \"Then forget it,\" she says. They can do this because the Clinton Administration has committed itself to persuading youngsters to use condoms or practice abstinence in this frightening age of AIDS -- and because Americans are finally beginning to accept the fact that sexual activity, however ill advised or premature it may be, is for most young people close to inevitable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Abroad at Home; What Might Have Been","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/abroad-at-home-what-might-have-been.html","abstract":"  Madeleine K.

The setting is San Francisco in 1976. Mr. Maupin's characters -- part factual, part fictional -- began appearing that year in his San Francisco Chronicle newspaper columns.

Also making the team was Amy Peterson, a silver medalist in the 1992 Games.

The drama and dignity of the Phrygian cadence, the wildly expressive melisma of Moorish origin, the delicate sensuousness of the guitar: all create pressure on composers to keep these assets intact. Perhaps one reason German music, to take one example, has been explored more widely and deeply than Spain's is that its folk materials are relatively uninteresting and therefore lend themselves to easy manipulation.   Saturday evening's concert by Sharon Isbin and Benita Valente at the Metropolitan Museum offered guitar solos and songs with guitar accompaniment. An evening's worth of \"Spanish style\" has its dangers, for once one sees past the natural riches one begins to question how interestingly they are being used. In the case of \"El mirar de la maja,\" one of the six Granados \"Tonadillas escritas en estilo antiguo,\" the answer would be wondrously well. To the irresistible melodrama of Spanish music, this song adds something profound. Its dignified despair has haunted this listener all his life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"NATO Plan Welcomes New Eastern Partners; Yalta All Over Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/l-nato-plan-welcomes-new-eastern-partners-yalta-all-over-again-832049.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   For every Central European -- Hungarian, Pole, Czech or Slovak -- the word Yalta, the place where the leaders of the Allied Forces met in 1945, has only one meaning: the time and the place where the West sold them out to Stalin and the Soviet Union.

Men and women over the age of 50 seem to think they will not be infected with the disease, researchers said, even though 10 percent of AIDS cases, including those of gay men, are diagnosed each year in that age group. The highest rate of heterosexual transmission of AIDS occurs in people over 50, they said.    The survey was conducted by Dr. Ron Stall and Dr. Joe Catania of the University of California in San Francisco and is described today in the Archives of Internal Medicine.   Younger people seem to be getting the message about ways to protect themselves against AIDS, Dr. Stall said. But for older people there has been no public health warning. \"When have you ever seen an AIDS poster with a wrinkled face?\" he said. Focus on Specific Risks    To find out what older Americans are doing to protect themselves against AIDS, the researchers culled 3,188 interviews with people over the age of 50 from large national surveys on the disease. \"We focused on heterosexuals and looked for specific risk factors,\" Dr. Stall said.   Ten percent of the men and women said they had had multiple sexual partners or a blood transfusion in the 1980's before AIDS screening was widely available, Dr. Stall said. Despite these risk factors, he said, older people were six times less likely to use condoms and five times less likely to have tests for AIDS than people in their 20's with similar risk factors.    \"We heard a lot of people say 'Thank God, this wasn't around in my day,' \" Dr. Stall said. \"But it is around in their day. It's such a horrible epidemic. It's easy to deny your own risk.\"   Doctors tend to ignore AIDS risk factors in their older patients, said Dr. Mitchell Feldman, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. \"They assume older people don't have sex and are not at risk,\" he said. \"But not only are they having sex, they are not taking precautions.\"   People over the age of 50 have consistently accounted for 10 percent of AIDS cases since the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began keeping track of the numbers. More than 33,000 people over 50 are now infected with AIDS.   Education programs about H.I.V. for older Americans are badly needed, Dr. Feldman said.  They would reduce the risk in that age group, he said, and \"trickle down\" to younger Americans who may take their own risk of contracting AIDS more seriously if they see their parents taking protective measures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Mideast Talks: What Happened?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/mideast-talks-what-happened.html","abstract":"  The lengthening delays in the Middle East peace talks are disheartening to Israelis, Palestinians and others around the world whose hopes soared with the announcement of the historic September framework peace agreement.

But Jim McMahon is no phony tough guy, and he was scared today during his Minnesota Vikings' 17-10 playoff loss to the Giants.   On the second play of the second half, with the Vikings nursing a 10-3 lead, McMahon dropped back to pass. As he threw incomplete, the Giants' Mike Fox smashed into him from behind, and a split second later Keith Hamilton hit him from the front. McMahon's head was bent back.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940110","time":"1994-01-10

Representatives from most nations have been searching feverishly in areas nearby the nine cities that will stage a monthlong tournament. It appears that only two or three have made firm commitments on their choice of training sites and housing.   United States   After games this month against Norway, Switzerland and Russia, the Americans will join three other finalists -- Bolivia, Colombia and Sweden -- in a tournament at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami Feb. 18 and 20.   The tournament will consist of a doubleheader each day, with the Americans playing Bolivia on the first day and Sweden on the second. The tournament will use the new point system adopted for the World Cup that calls for 3 points for a victory and 1 for a tie. The team with the most points wins the tournament.   Claudio Reyna, who led Virginia to its third consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association championship, has joined the World Cup team along with Frank Klopas of AEK of the Greek First Division and Dario Brose, who played in the French Second Division. He may play in Saturday's exhibition against Norway at Tempe, Ariz.   Reyna became the first player to capture the Missouri Athletic Club Sports Foundation award for the second year in a row as the outstanding player of the year. The talented midfielder from Springfield, N.J., won the coveted award yesterday with almost twice as many votes as he did last year. Through the Grapevine   Several of the 24 finalists are trying to schedule exhibition games before the tournament, which will start June 17 and end with the championship game July 17 in Los Angeles.   The United States, which will play its first-round games in Pontiac, Mich., and Pasadena, Calif., may play Greece at Giants Stadium in late May.

The fans will be given T-shirts by the Irish tourism office to promote Ireland as a holiday destination for the millions of American citizens who claim Irish ancestry and others.

Its five movements, each inspired by a character or situation in the Superman comics, have more the character of a suite of scherzos or lively overtures, or what are now called concert openers. Yet an American composer trying to make his living at orchestral music is hard pressed to write anything but concert openers, so the symphony's somewhat ad hoc character might be overlooked.   The more pressing issue is whether Mr. Daugherty has come up with a style befitting the sexiness of his subject. Although he produces a distinctive texture -- thudding ostinatos, quick-cut jumps and shifts, swirling glissandos, sirens and rimshots and the like -- his harmonies are curiously static, his rhythms more often insistent than incisive. Echoes of Sibelius's Fourth Symphony, Britten's \"Sinfonia da Requiem,\" Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand (heard later on the program, as it happened) and even Franz Waxman's score for \"Sunset Boulevard\" collide in strangely joyless fashion, and with the exception of the darkly glowering \"Krypton\" movement the music never seems to take flight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940112","headline":"Self-Esteem and Friendship In a Factory on Death Row","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/us/self-esteem-and-friendship-in-a-factory-on-death-row.html","abstract":"  The death row garment factory is humming at midday.

North-South have overbid to seven spades, and the diagram gives a possible route. North's two no-trump is Jacoby, asking for a singleton, and four no-trump is the modern variety of Blackwood, Roman Key Card. A five-club response shows zero or three key cards, counting the trump king together with the four aces. Five diamonds is an inquiry about the trump queen, and six clubs shows that card plus the club king. When North discovers that South has a singleton diamond, all the top spades and the club king he gambles on a grand slam.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940112","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/style/chronicle-851841.html","abstract":"  After what was described as a long spiritual journey, the DUCHESS OF KENT is leaving the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic.
