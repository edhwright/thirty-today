Its main competitor, International Creative Management, resembles a none-too-happy family, with everyone in it locked in separate rooms and barely speaking to one another. A third agency, United Talent, is in such a state of crisis that it recently hired a therapist to work out the hostile, aggressive and passive-aggressive tendencies of its agents.   Then there's the William Morris Agency, which is struggling to remake its personality. From a group of rigid and aloof elderly men (women were not promoted to senior positions) the agency is seeking to turn itself into the brashest kid on the block.

Mr. Moyers' two minutes twice a week are billed as \"Perspectives,\" a fancy word for opinions. In the latter half of the Tuesday and Thursday programs, Tom Brokaw segues into Mr. Moyers, who leans on a big desk or table in what pretends to be nothing more intimate than a studio set.

For example, Mr. Moyers criticized the line-item veto proposal as permitting the President to cut out small pork but not big pork; fat-cat political contributors, he noted, are spared.

The skeptics should hang their heads. According to a study by researchers at Rockefeller University, the body has a mind of its own -- and it is bent on getting back to its pre-diet weight.   The Rockefeller group recruited 41 people, all of whom were required to live at the university's clinical center while their diet and activities were carefully controlled and rigidly monitored.

Much African art is small enough to be carried by hand, which can make it seem insignificant. Because it is often made of perishable materials, surviving objects tend to be recent, suggesting falsely that the art itself lacks a history. And because the names of artists, even those who had great local fame in Africa, went unrecorded, we seldom look to this art for personalities, or even the personal touch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950310","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/arts/art-in-review-947995.html","abstract":"   'From Haiti'   Leica Gallery  670 Broadway (at Bond Street)  East Village  Through April 5    With all its troubles, Haiti has attracted more than its share of photojournalists.

None of this would signify anything, of course, beyond Mr. Bleckner's personal good fortune, if his work justified a big show at a major museum.

This brief piece juxtaposes long viola, cello and violin solos in wide-spaced intervals with pounding string chords, buzzing triplets and busy fugal textures. The \"Sinfonietta\" is well-built music.

Anyone looking for a coherent perspective on Jewish music would have come away from the three-day affair, entitled \"A Question of Identity: Music From the Jewish Community,\" disappointed and dismayed.    It was, I think, a necessary incoherence, the right kind of chaos. Too many people in the past have been terrifyingly certain about what Jewish music is or should be. The Nazi campaign of destruction against the Jewish community of Europe was predicated in large measure on a description of Jewish culture. Nazi musical views drew on the writings of Richard Wagner, particularly the infamous essay \"Judaism in Music,\" a pivotal document of modern anti-Semitism. This cataclysmic string of definitions warns us not to define.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950311","headline":"Violinist Cancels Recital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/11/arts/violinist-cancels-recital.html","abstract":"  The violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg has canceled her Carnegie Hall debut recital on Monday, which was to have been presented under the auspices of the 92d Street Y.

Dye of the New York Supreme Court to keep playing. The court ruled that the principals' committee of the Catholic High School Athletic Association could not bar the team from league play the rest of this season and all next season. The team will meet St. Francis Prep at 8 tonight at Bishop Ford High School in Brooklyn for the diocesan championship, with further tournament games if it wins. The C.H.S.A.A. limits its member teams to one unapproved trip a season beyond the metropolitan area, and Christ the King played tournaments in Altoona, Pa., in early December and in Pickerington, Ohio, in late December. It said the league president had given verbal permission for the Altoona tournament.

Young America was scheduled to meet Stars & Stripes. But before the start of the match, winds on the course off San Diego were measured at more than 20 knots, the maximum allowed.

GOLF  O'Meara Takes Lead in Honda Classic  The tour veteran Mark O'Meara, winless since the 1992 AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, continued his steady climb back to form yesterday in the Honda Classic in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. O'Meara, 38, shot a round of 65 for a total of nine-under-par 133 and a three-stroke lead over Blaine McCallister (66) and Andrew Magee (67). The first-round leader, Jim McGovern, who opened with a 65, struggled to a 74 and stood at 139, three under par and six shots back.

WELL, NOT QUITE To both its proponents and critics, the slotless slot machine, as it is known, represents something of an artful high-tech dodge of state laws that prohibit slot machines in New York, even on Indian reservations where casino gambling is allowed. They provide the individualized, fast-paced and uncomplicated gambling that slot machine users crave. But because they have no levers, do not require players to insert money and do not return money -- a player's winnings or losses are recorded on computer -- the terminals don't seem to fit the legal definition of a slot machine.
