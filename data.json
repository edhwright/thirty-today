The \"Blue Guide: Literary Britain and Ireland\" and books like \"Isak Dinesen's Africa\" and \"James Joyce's Ireland,\" by David Pierce, direct those who derive an esthetic and touristic satisfaction from standing where something happened in writers' lives or in their books.   It's an impulse as old as the quills, older in fact. In antiquity, young Roman noblemen, touring Greece as part of their higher education, delighted in visiting literary and mythological sites -- the marketplace where Socrates taught, the cliff from which lovesick Sappho leaped to her death, the plain where Troy burned, causing the Trojan hero Aeneas to flee to Italy, where he sired a line that descended to their own emperor Augustus. This last was a piece of mythology that the poet Virgil had made into a kind of holy book to justify Rome's place in history, and his \"Aeneid\" sent hundreds of togaed visitors to Troy, where it all began.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/travel/q-and-a-538752.html","abstract":"  By Freighter Down Under    Q. Can you give me any detailed information about getting to Australia and New Zealand by freighter? -- Stanley Hamer, Sebring, Fla.   A. There are two freighter lines with passenger cabins that make the trip to Australia from the United States, and both can be boarded in Florida.   Columbus Line operates four ships from the East Coast, three with three double cabins and six singles and one with four doubles. The ships are the Columbus America, the Columbus Australia, the Columbus New Zealand and the Columbus Queensland. On the West Coast the Columbus Victoria, with four double cabins, leaves from Los Angeles. All accommodations are in outside cabins with private bathrooms.   The vessels are registered in Germany and have German officers.   The East Coast voyages begin in Jacksonville, Fla., continue to Houston, and then transit the Panama Canal to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in Australia and Wellington, Auckland and Port Chalmers, New Zealand. On the return trip the vessels end the voyage in Philadelphia, sometimes calling at Kingston, Jamaica, on the way.   The round-trip voyages from the East Coast take 68 days; one-way voyages last about a month. Jacksonville departures are made about once a month; from Los Angeles ships leave every 50 days.   Round-trip fares from Jacksonville are $5,450 a person, with two people to a cabin, and $6,070 a person for a single cabin. One-way fares from Jacksonville to Australia are $2,725 a person (two to a cabin) and $3,035 for a single. One-way fares to New Zealand are $3,270 and $3,645 a person.   More information can be obtained from Freighter World Cruises, 180 South Lake Avenue, Pasadena, Calif. 91101; telephone (818) 449-3106. The company acts as exclusive passenger agent in North America for 14 lines and publishes a twice-a-month update of what ships are going where and what the trip will cost. A subscription to the publication, called Freighter Space Advisory, is $33 a year.   The other freighter company with passenger space that makes the run to Australia and New Zealand, the Blue Star line, operates four ships on the East Coast and they, too, leave from Jacksonville. The ships are the America Star, the Melbourne Star, the Sydney Star and the Queensland Star. Its two ships on the West Coast, the Columbia Star and the California Star, leave from Los Angeles. All the ships are registered in the Bahamas.    The East Coast ships transit the Panama Canal and cross the Pacific Ocean to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, continuing to Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, returning to Philadelphia. The West Coast ships cross to Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington and Auckland, coming back through Suva, Fiji, and ending the voyage in Seattle.    The round-trip fare from Jacksonville is from $5,400 to $7,700 a person for two people sharing a cabin, depending on the time of year, with summer sailings at the lower end of the range. The round-trip voyage from Los Angeles, which takes 42 days, is $4,400 a person for two people sharing a cabin or $5,300 a person for a single cabin. The round trip from Jacksonville takes from 65 to 70 days. There are about 20 sailings a year from Jacksonville and 17 a year from Los Angeles.    The Blue Star line, which is represented by the Travltips Cruise and Freighter Association, recently introduced a fly-sail program.    Passengers can fly from Los Angeles to Australia or New Zealand and come back to the West Coast by ship, for a total of 22 days at sea. Fares are about $2,900 a person for two people sharing a cabin or $3,308 for a single cabin. The air fare to Los Angeles would be an additional expense for East Coast passengers.    Passengers can also sail from Jacksonville to Australia and fly back to the West Coast. Fares start at $3,600 a person for two people sharing a cabin. On that trip you would be sea for about 30 days.    Travltips, 163-07 Depot Road, Post Office Box 188, Flushing, N.Y. 11358, (800) 872-8584, puts out a 32-page magazine every other month on news of ships and accounts of trips by association members. The magazine, Travltips, is available for $15 a year. Polish Trains   Q. I will be traveling to Poland soon. Can you give me some information about the availability of trains between Warsaw and Cracow and the approximate travel time? -- J. James, Smithtown, L.I.   A. The two cities are very well served by rail, with a minimum of five express trains every day from Warsaw to Cracow.   In addition, at least three Inter-City trains make the trip from the capital to Cracow every day, with additional Inter-City service once a day from Monday to Saturday, once a day from Monday to Friday and once a day from Sunday to Friday.   On the return trip to Warsaw there are five express trains every day, with an additional daily express from Monday to Saturday, plus four Inter-City trains a day.    The journey by express and Inter-City to Cracow takes 2 hours 40 minutes. One-way tickets for express trains with seat reservations are $13 in first class and $9 in second. One-way tickets for Inter-City trains with seat reservations are $14 in first class and $10 in second. The Inter-City trains, which are part of the European Inter-City network, are newer than the expresses and in first class the price of the ticket includes a small sandwich, fruit and tea, coffee or a soft drink.    Express trains leave Warsaw every day at 6:55 A.M., 9 A.M., 12:55 P.M., 3:55 P.M. and 6:55 P.M. From Sunday to Friday an express leaves at 4:55 P.M.    The Inter-City leaves Warsaw every day at 10:55 A.M., 2:55 P.M. and at 5:55 P.M. An Inter-City also leaves at 7:55 A.M. from Monday to Saturday, at 9:55 A.M. from Monday to Friday, and at 1:55 P.M. from Sunday to Friday.

Budapest and Vienna   Q. I will be in Budapest from April 22 for a week and will then go to Vienna for a week. What sort of temperatures can I expect? -- Betty Wilson, Scarsdale, N.Y.   A. Weather conditions in both cities will be strikingly similar, with a slight edge in temperature to Budapest.   Average highs in Budapest in April are 62 degrees and average lows 44. The comparable figures for Vienna are 58 and 42.   The average monthly precipitation is both cities in April is identical at 1.8 inches.

That is when Jim Calhoun, the coach of the Connecticut Huskies, spat out the declaration -- \"This will never happen again\" -- that established the workmanlike approach that helped create a memorable season.   It was not a championship season, because the disappearance of a 10-point lead in the second half became a 69-60 overtime loss to Florida and an abrupt end to a 29-5 season. The first-place finish in the revived Big East -- by a conference-record three-game margin -- is not regarded as a championship. The team that came within one step of matching the longest trip any of Connecticut's 17 N.C.A.A. teams have taken in the tournament became another casualty in an East Regional of surprising results. Season Worth Treasuring    And yet for all the high standards the Huskies have created, and all the imperfections to be dissected at the end, the lasting memory is the contrast between the coach's embarrassed resolve of a year ago and the words that tumbled out early this morning.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"It's Time to Do Something About This Sexist Term 'Secretary'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/opinion/l-it-s-time-to-do-something-about-this-sexist-term-secretary-589357.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"As the Boss Goes, So Goes the Secretary: Is It Bias?\" (front page, March 17) points out that a secretary's salary is tied to her boss's salary and is likely to be downgraded along with his, without justification.

I heard in that class that many in Europe had believed that Jews had been taught by the Talmud to poison the wells and that the Black Death had been brought by \"Talmud Jews.\" I learned that in the Middle Ages, it was firmly believed that the Talmud instructed Jews to use the blood of Christians in the ritual of making matzoh, the unleavened Passover bread, and so the manuscripts of the Talmud were often burned by princes on advice of the church. In the required course in literature, we were studying \"The Merchant of Venice.\" The \"enlightened\" teacher made a point of telling us that Shylock's crassness and anger were not an innate characteristic of Jews; it was the unfortunate cast that centuries of obedience to the Talmud had given their character. \n\nEarly in the morning before going to school I studied the Talmud with my father; he was waiting for me when I came home so that we could return to the text. I had no doubt that what I was hearing at school was wrong and hurtful. My problem was: Why had \"they\" been saying such things for so long? The easiest answer was theological bias, deeply ingrained in Western culture. The metaphor the first Talmudists used to explain themselves to themselves -- that the Talmud, the authoritative library of Jewish law, ethics, mysticism and folklore, is an ocean and that those who study it are swimmers who fight great waves to find truth -- has persisted among the students of rabbinic texts for more than 20 centuries. But for the early Christians, the chronicles of the discussions and debates of the rabbis in the great academies of Jewish learning for the seven centuries ending with A.D. 500, which constitute the Talmud, were a Dead Sea, and the Pharisees, who founded those great academies, a sect that preferred the letter of the law to its spirit. Western Christian culture had been embroidering this charge for centuries. In the 1700's and 1800's, many of those willing and even eager to give Jews equal rights made it clear that emancipation would come only if the Jews would free themselves from the separatist rituals and nonsensical tales and doctrines that were recorded in the Talmud. (This enlightened idea even appeared among Jews. Most socialists, many Zionists and almost all Reform Jews believed, only a generation ago, that the Jewish spirit was hobbled by the legalisms of the Talmud.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"The Seven-Month Effort to Rescue NY 1078-93 Is Nearing a Nervous Ending","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/nyregion/about-long-island-seven-month-effort-rescue-ny-1078-93-nearing-nervous-ending.html","abstract":"  YOU wonder if she knows, this whale that swims round and round a tank in the aquarium at Coney Island.

(Of course then as now, necessity drove more women to work than mere opportunity did.) Women won the right to vote in Germany in 1918 and in America two years later.    They also established a sizable presence in the arts. By 1935 an American survey found that about 41 per cent of artists receiving Government assistance were women; presumably that means a pretty fair number were doing all right before the Depression hit. Photography was held up to women as a field where they could make their mark, both as business people and as artists.

Florence may stupefy a visitor with its artistic and architectural richness, but thanks to human proportions and harmony of design never loses its human feel.

Zubin Mehta conducts the festival orchestra for Schoenberg's \"Moses und Aron\" on April 26 and 29, and for works by Mozart and Bartok May 4 and 5.

The mix of the play, of history and of an exceptionally good performance by Eli Wallach makes for a production that both entertains and haunts.   Under Odets's direction, \"The Flowering Peach\" originally opened on Broadway in late December 1954, the year made memorable by the telecast of the Army-McCarthy hearings. The folksy Odets comedy fit the fashion of those fearful times, when unpopular political opinions were to be avoided at all costs.

She was the preternatural free spirit, the one who dreamed up modern dance as a thing of powerful simplicity and economic means aligned with great music, the one who beat a barefoot path for the likes of Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham to follow. Live free, dance free, be free was her guiding principle. Although many luminaries of her day have described the power of Duncan's dancing, no shred of film footage exists; she steadfastly avoided the movie camera, believing that the absence of an audience would alter her art. The remarkable drawings and photographs in LIFE INTO ART: Isadora Duncan and Her World (Norton, $40) give a vivid sense of Duncan; for example, Abraham Walkowitz's spare, brilliant watercolors and line drawings depict her on stage with her marvelously long curving neck stretched heavenward and her feet kissing the ground. The text -- by Duncan's grandniece, Doree Duncan; Carol Pratl, a dancer and teacher; and Cynthia Splatt, the author of \"Isadora Duncan and Gordon Craig\" -- is, while graceful, a hit-and-run affair that gives minutiae nearly equal rank with major events and screens out such material as Duncan's besotted, suicidal states of mourning. For the grainy details of truth that bring a reader close to this mesmerizing figure, there's still no book to compare to Francis Steegmuller's \"Your Isadora.\" There one finds Gordon Craig, the actor and theatrical producer, commenting to Duncan on a photo of her and their daughter, Deirdre -- on how it misses perfection because mother is not looking down at daughter, but straight ahead at the camera. The same photo in \"Life Into Art\" sheds no such specific light.

It's a sentiment particularly appropriate to Connecticut in 1994, the year of the relentless winter. And there will be a profusion of song, both solemn and joyous, to be heard around the state throughout Holy Week.   Some of it will be presented outdoors, if it doesn't snow. In Wethersfield, at the First Church of Christ, a sunrise service is to be held in the cemetery behind the church on Easter morning, with music by a brass ensemble of young parishioners.  (Caution: Daylight Saving Time goes into effect that day, and dawn will be at 6:34 A.M.)   The South Britain Congregational Church has engaged the Royal Brass Quartet to play a half-hour concert on the green in front of the church at 10 A.M. Easter Sunday, and the First Congregational Church in Old Greenwich will offer a 15-minute outdoor performance preceding each of its services today through next Sunday.   Indoors, at the Church of the Redeemer in New Haven, a \"Messiah\" sing-in will be held on Friday at 8 P.M., reviving a tradition that was popular in the 1980's.    And in Woodbridge, a new music-drama will be given its first performance this evening at 7 P.M. at Trinity Evangelical Free Church. \"The Victor,\" by David T. Clydesdale, Tim Shepherd, David Mullin and Jim Owens, tells the story of Jesus's death and burial through the eyes of Benjamin, a mythical Jewish religious leader of the period.

Beck's borrowings aren't sacred relics as they are for 60's idolaters like Lenny Kravitz; they're only junk he found on the cultural sidelines.

In this excerpt, Mr. Lydon describes a boat party the group threw for the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE JUBILEE WAS THAT you could do anything you liked for 24 hours. It was supposed total freedom. All the pubs were open all night.  People were supposed to celebrate, so that's what we did. We rented a boat, went out on the river, turned up the volume and played our favorite new song (\"God Save the Queen\").  No doubt countless complained because the amount of police who turned up to stop us was outrageous. Motor launches.  They waited on every bridge in case any of us jumped off and got away. Fabulous.

But surprise: Against all theatrical logic (if there is such a thing), the performance, two summers ago, turned out to be very good on almost every level. Indeed, the project seemed an unqualified success, at least in the first two acts, and those of us in Europe who staggered out of bed at 6 A.M. for the third act were too busy reveling in our virtuous fortitude to quibble.   Now, with the performance released on video (Teldec 4509-90212; VHS cassette and laser disk), we can check the accuracy of our recollections. The video presentation faithfully matches the live telecast, the liner notes report, except that two gaffes -- a nasty fall by Placido Domingo in the first act and a momentary sighting of a camera in the second -- have been papered over with footage from one of the two dress rehearsals. That's too bad, since the cleanup robs the performance of spontaneity, continuity and documentary verisimilitude.

That idea is fairly and spaciously set out, with a great deal of new or unfamiliar work. Not to see this show is not to know Picasso.   The art historians responsible for the exhibition (at the Tate only, through May 8), Elizabeth Cowling and John Golding, have chosen and installed 168 works in terms not of rivalry between painting and sculpture but of a dialogue between stupendous equals.

But many frugal New Jersey diners are setting aside such qualms about meals in culinary school restaurants and are finding savory deals indeed.\n\nAt Careme's, the airy, student-run restaurant at Atlantic Community College in Mays Landing, lunch and dinner are offered on weekdays during the school year from September through mid-May. \n\nOn a more modest scale, the Bergen Room in Paramus is the informal eating place operated by the hotel and restaurant management students at Bergen Community College. Bargain lunches are served there Tuesday through Thursday and dinner on Thursday.\n\nDonald Del Nero, the manager of the Bergen Room, said: \"It's kind of a sleeper. Not many people know about it, yet we get booked up by regulars right away.\"\n\nIn Careme's coolly modern dining room with widely spaced tables, students in the two-year program of Atlantic Community College's Academy of Culinary Arts cook the meals and serve the tables, all under faculty supervision. Many of these future chefs and managers will go on to work not far away in the Atlantic City casino restaurants.\n\nThe young serving staff in white shirts, bow ties and long aprons is trained in formal tableside preparation, and dishes like Caesar salad and orange-scented crepes suzette are usually good bets. Some of the extras, however, like chilled forks for the salad and iced spoons for the sherbet intermezzo are unnecessary gimmicks.\n\nAs you would expect, not every dish is textbook perfect, but the pleasant young staff tries hard, and satisfying choices can be found. Dinner is a la carte, with entrees between $13 and $15. The French-accented menu changes once a week, and a four-course dinner averages $20. Entrees offered recently included walnut chicken, duckling with ginger and cassis, and veal medallions with mushrooms in a flour-thickened brown sauce. The pace is leisurely, and the table is yours for the evening.\n\nSuzanne Faye, whose title is dining room educator, said: \"Part of the students' curriculum is to learn the front of the house as well as the back of the house. This restaurant is really a classroom, and they spend 15 days out here, and then they cook for 15 days.\" \n\nAt lunch, a buffet is offered for $11.95. The dishes change daily, but always include a soup of the day, an assortment of cold pates, fruits, cheeses and Mediterranean-style salads, plus five entrees. For dessert, there's a display of pastries.\n\nThe restaurant is part of the academy's $4.6 million complex, which was completed in 1991 and includes kitchens, classrooms and even a greenhouse on campus where herbs are grown.\n\nReservations are necessary. For lunch, the hours for seating are 11:30 A.M. to noon; for dinner, 6 to 7:30 P.M. This year graduation is on May 13, when the restaurant will close for the summer. There is no liquor license, and no smoking is allowed.\n\nCareme's, Atlantic Community College, 5100 Black Horse Pike (Route 322), Mays Landing. (609) 625-1111.\n\n\nAt Bergen Community College, a corner of the faculty dining room has been set apart with accordion dividers and called the Bergen Room. This somewhat makeshift spot runs on a limited schedule, serving lunch three days a week and dinner one night a week.\n\nProf. Daniel Chadwick said the meals were popular with the college's faculty and students as well as some local residents. \"We've got waiting lists for dinner,\" he said, ading that the menu is priced to cover food costs, not labor or overhead expenses.  With three-course meals averaging $8 at both lunch and dinner, he said, \"if we don't always do the best job, at least it doesn't upset the customer much.\" \n\nThe 13 students in a typical class rotate in the 13 positions, from dishwasher to controller. The school's program is geared toward the management and supervisory ends of the hotel and restaurant business rather than the culinary, said Mr. Del Nero, the Bergen Room manager.\n\nNevertheless, some of the dishes sampled on a lunchtime visit were more than acceptable. Fried calamari with spicy tomato sauce and a pleasantly filling soup of creamed corn and chicken were the starters, followed by a chef's salad (though with bottled-tasting dressing) so large it would have been ample for lunch, not just a salad course.\n\nThe main course was a gingery chicken breast accompanied by soft stir-fried vegetables and fried rice. For dessert, there was a choice of an ice cream parfait or a tasty maple syrup-flavored mousse. \n\nReservations are necessary and are accepted from Tuesday through Thursday between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. The restaurant hours for lunch are noon to 1 P.M. Tuesday through Thursday; for dinner, 7 P.M. Thursday. The semester ends on May 12.\n\nThe Bergen Room, Bergen Community College, 400 Paramus Road, Paramus.

Historians have dealt harshly with the period following the revolutions that swept through the cities of Europe in 1848. Repressive, reactionary, stuffed with overblown eclectic buildings, the third quarter of the 19th century was dominated by bad faith and bad taste. Yet this was also the era that gave us the cosmopolis, the dazzling hub of industrial and imperial prosperity, a place designed to be not only a home to its citizens but also a host to the rest of the world.   The year 1848 is remembered more for barricades than for buildings; in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Spain, workers and students took to the streets to fight for a litany of socialist demands. The year is also remembered as a time of disillusionment, a season when European artists and intellectuals lost their faith in social progress. Many artists adopted the oppositional stance that persists, in somewhat fossilized form, to this day. But something more profound than utopian hope perished in the uprisings of 1848. Neither wholly of the middle class nor fully estranged from it, many artists lost a clear sense of which side of the barricades they were on. That perplexity, the gnawing sense of doubt and displacement underlying the epoch's showy display of confidence, is what is most compelling about architecture and urbanism in the years after 1848.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940327","headline":"The Secret of Angels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/arts/theater-the-secret-of-angels.html","abstract":"  In \"Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,\" Tony Kushner's two-part drama on Broadway, there are verbal and visual references to all sorts of things, including pop and gay culture, Judaism, Mormonism, American history and New York City landmarks.

The Sofitel was beyond my budget; still, I wanted to know what extras you get when you book a room at a discount rate in the nation's capital. \n\nSo just as the February thaw set in, I boarded an unreserved Amtrak train called the Banker, which takes travelers from New York to Washington for a round-trip excursion fare of $92. Right on schedule three and a half hours later, the train pulled into Washington's glorious Beaux Arts Union Station.

The $1.5 billion the I.M.F. has promised -- after months of delay -- is much too little to turn the economy around. But the agreement is still crucial because it paves the way for Russia to receive other international help.

But as the narrator says, \"He dreamed of nothing but being rich,\" and the fantasy paralyzed him. \"He couldn't even paint.\" Xiaochun is so ready to leave the relationship and the country that she writes to relatives in New York and hopes to join them.   The film is most intruiging when it becomes a window on aspects of Chinese culture rarely depicted on screen. Some early-morning sex between Xiaodong and Xiaochun is discreet by American standards, but the scene is long and emphatic enough to be unusual in a Chinese film. And at times \"The Days\" effectively suggests the tension between an awful past that the characters want to forget and a present that seems cut off from all meaning. Xiaochun's parents had been persecuted by her entire school when she was 16. There is no need for the film to belabor the point that when she finally goes to New York, she writes to Xiaodong without reference to their life together. In the words of the narrator, she acts \"as if the past had evaporated.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940329","headline":"For Insects, the Buzz Is Chemical","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/29/science/for-insects-the-buzz-is-chemical.html","abstract":"  HUMAN beings are audio-visual chauvinists. Much of what people learn in life is conveyed through the eyes and ears. As a result, people have long been blind to the currency of communication that rules the rest of the natural world: chemicals.  Whether seeking a mate, detecting a predator, deceiving a rival or tending to duties in the nest, most species rely on chemical signals to tell them where to go and how to behave.    Now a growing band of scientists working in a young field called chemical ecology is focusing on the extraordinary diversity of chemical languages found in the animal and plant kingdoms. They are studying chemicals that alarm, chemicals that seduce, chemicals that repel, chemicals that persuade. They are learning that for any single species, the vocabulary of chemicals can be extremely rich, capable of telling an individual not just where a potential partner may be found, for example, but whether that partner is a virgin or a vamp, an industrious provider with food to share, or a loser whose cupboards are bare.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940329","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/29/sports/transactions-611123.html","abstract":"  Baseball American League  BALTIMORE ORIOLES -- Purchased the contract of Lonnie Smith, outfielder, from Rochester of the International League and assigned him to the 40-man roster.
