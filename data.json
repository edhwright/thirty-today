If any senators are tempted to hold their noses and vote for the amendment in the belief that enough states will later block ratification, they may be recklessly misguided.   The amendment would require the approval of 38 of the 50 states, meaning any 13 could block it. Many experts predicted the amendment would have a tough time gaining approval once states realized the impact on their economies of a trillion-dollar Federal cutback. But the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, has made a preliminary assessment. Only five states appear firmly opposed to the amendment. With hard work, its opponents might take nine more states. An additional nine are possible but improbable opponents.

The game at Byrne Meadowlands Arena was between the two least productive teams in the National Hockey League and the Devils prevailed thanks to a couple of brilliant individual plays by Scott Niedermayer and Stephane Richer, their most talented players.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950216","headline":"Chancellor Says Pataki Cuts Will Raise Tuition and Force Layoffs of 1,000 Professors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/16/us/giuliani-s-spending-play-cuny-chancellor-says-pataki-cuts-will-raise-tuition.html","abstract":"  The City University of New York will have to raise tuition by $1,000 a student and lay off more than 1,000 full-time professors, a quarter of the full-time force, if the state budget cuts proposed by Gov.

True, the vase paintings are linear compositions using a limited range of colors, and so are the modern drawings. But the concentric circles in the 1969 Louise Bourgeois have only a distant relation to the geometric decoration on a circular pyxis, or lidded box. The German art historian Alois Riegl may have argued for the priority of abstraction over realism in the evolution of the ornamental tendril; nonetheless, the loopy shapes in Brice Marden's etching \"After Botticelli 4\" don't look anything like the vine leaves on the nearby calyx-krater, or wine vessel. Nor do the leaves in the 1949 Matisse resemble those on the tiny cuplike skyphos next to it.

Such classics as \"The Fox and the Raven\" and \"The Cricket and the Ant\" were our equivalents of Winnie the Pooh and Mother Goose: the earliest tales with which we were read to sleep, the first verses we read and recited in school. The obligation to memorize La Fontaine's poems, made all the more enticing by Grandville's illustrations of woodland creatures in hilariously formal antique garb, never lay heavily on us. It was, in fact, a source of constant delight because these fables embodied the rhetorical device to which children are most drawn: the attribution of human thought and discourse to members of the animal kingdom.   But La Fontaine's cautionary verses, the theme of a beautiful little show at the New York Public Library, stamped our consciousness far more deeply than Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail affected children of the English-speaking world. They were composed according to the central agenda of 17th-century French literature -- \"To Please and to Instruct\" -- and instruct they did, relentlessly. Continually cited in the classroom or at the family dinner table, they became a code of conduct, a delectably ironic secular catechism programmed toward character building and self-improvement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"The Fear of Growth : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/opinion/IHT-the-fear-of-growth-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Bravo for Guy Molyneux's thoughtful and provocative article (\"When Productivity Is Up but Pay Isn't, Democratic Civility Is Down,\" Opinion, Feb. 15).

This portrait of a society that has a legalized sex industry, total equality for homosexuals, an open but regulated sale of marijuana and apparently racial harmony has the sober plodding tone of an extended Chamber of Commerce advertisement.    Far from stimulating crime and unbridled hedonism, the film suggests, the Netherlands' liberal attitudes on sex, drugs, abortion, guns (they are forbidden) and capital punishment (there is none) reflect a national temperament that is sedate bordering on glum. A word that keeps cropping up in the scores of interviews with Dutch Government officials and scholars about the country's approach to issues of individual freedom is \"pragmatic.\" The Government doesn't think in terms of good and evil.

Not Exactly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-pride-of-the-yankees-not-exactly.html","abstract":"  Who were these guys? Where had they come from? The answer, in Bill Henderson's case, was from a card buried in Rudy Santin's Rolodex.   Santin, the Yankees' Florida-based scout, pulled that card with Henderson's Miami phone number, and tried his luck at dial-a-catcher on Tuesday afternoon.   \"Been playing ball?\" Santin asked.   \"None at all, not for years,\" Henderson said. \"Sorry.\"   Nothing to be sorry about, Santin told him. And less than 48 hours later, Bill Henderson, whose last play was a home-plate collision six years ago, was pulling up his pin-striped pants one leg at a time, just like Joe D., Mickey and the Babe.   This little tale from the crypt once known as the Yankee clubhouse should give you an idea of what's going on here, at the start of replacement spring training, which is a joke, \"Star Search\" on Broadway. If the Yankees had this much trouble assembling pitchers and catchers, they may soon be picking position players out of the telephone book.   \"Some of these young men could earn positions in our organization,\" said George Steinbrenner, repeating the line the Yankees obviously fed their pitchers, catchers and dreamers. \"There might be some future star.\"   Now, there is only one, and he was not in uniform this morning. After more than two decades of trying, Steinbrenner is finally the biggest of all the New York Yankees. There is no one around who could possibly upstage the Boss.   That's why journalists grabbed hold of him the moment he hit the field, and Steinbrenner refused to let go. \"O.K, that's it,\" he would say after a while. Then he'd move a few feet, and start talking all over again.   His new sultans of swat would pass by, look up at him with reverence and gratitude. Fans pushed their paper and pens in his face and peppered him with questions and advice. George signed. George bantered. George leaned across the rail and planted a kiss on the cheek of a young girl. A guy who looked just like Don Mattingly -- honest -- told him the players would soon crawl back.   \"George, you've lost weight,\" an elderly gent told him.   That he had. A few more pounds, and he might have been out there, jogging alongside the nobodies in the most famous uniform in American sports. \"No, sir,\" Steinbrenner said to that proposition. He is the owner. The players are the players, even if they are not the players.   So who were these guys and where had they come from? Some were from the Yankees' minor leagues, in career atrophy, hoping to score organizational points. The others were the unremorseful has-beens we've been reading about these past few weeks, fantasy leaguers on leave from life.   \"I was between jobs,\" said Bill Henderson, holder of a marketing degree. \"My new job starts March 1. The boss said, 'Go for it.' \"   Henderson, 26, once went for the money, right out of high school, as the Detroit Tigers' 1987 first-round draft pick. Two years later, in the Florida State League, he was bowled over in a play at the plate, a season-ending injury that sent him back to school, for good.   At least he didn't sustain a concussion. \"He was out . . . I held on,\" Henderson recalled.   I'll admit that I'm breaking my personal oath to refrain from this \"I have a dream\" replacement material that strikes me, depending on the moment, as unpalatable or preposterous. Couldn't help it, especially after the way Henderson answered the question of how much he missed baseball after last summer's strike.   \"Actually,\" he said, \"I've always thought the baseball season was too long. By the time August comes around, I'm watching football.\"   How's that for expert commentary on the state of the national pastime? It might even have stopped Steinbrenner, as he blabbed on at the top dugout step, about how much baseball is \"interwoven into the American fabric,\" and how in small Indiana towns, men sit around all winter \"arguing who's better, Gehrig or Mattingly.\"   Meanwhile, journalists were so interested in the first workout of Steinbrenner's replacement Gehrigs that they surrounded the owner, pushing closer until one newspaper reporter, tired of being elbowed from behind, suddenly began landing punches to the head of a stunned magazine photographer.   The reporter was so quick with his right that Steinbrenner yelled out, \"Give that man a uniform!\"   For once, the reporter could compare himself to the athlete and know he had a better job.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/style/chronicle-544895.html","abstract":"  SHARON RICH, the author of three books about Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, will be making a pilgrimage to Washington next Friday on behalf of the two crooners, who appeared together in eight films.

When the American-born painter R. B. Kitaj's exhibition opened at the Tate last year, the reviews were so hostile that he announced he wouldn't show his work in England ever again. That was saying a lot for someone who had lived there more than half his life (he's 62), and who even coined the phrase \"School of London\" to describe the group of prominent painters that included himself, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. But Mr. Kitaj has always been a person to say what is on his mind, sometimes to his detriment.   Now that the retrospective is here you may well wonder what the fuss was about. If you go to the Met expecting another Freud exhibition, meaning one as galvanic and intense as the show of his work the museum had a year back, you'll be disappointed. This show has its inspired moments, though Mr. Kitaj is a painter whose ambitions outstrip his art. He deserves credit for those ambitions, and certainly not the caning he got in the British press. But his paintings can sometimes be abstruse and pretentious, and there are too many weak recent pictures on view to come out of the Metropolitan with more than mixed feelings. A Kitaj exhibition now at Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan includes some better new work that doesn't alter the bottom line.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/nyregion/no-headline-806995.html","abstract":"  \"We all just stopped and did a little praising God.\" DWAYNE CARR, after finding a baby who had survived a tornado in Alabama.

Sailing on one of Irving Berlin's most rhythmically propulsive scores, the production doesn't touch ground until the final reprise of that irresistibly buoyant Berlin ode to romantic giddiness, \"You're Just in Love.\"    The musical, with songs by Berlin and a book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, had the first of four concert performances on Thursday as part of City Center's Encore series of revivals. (The final performances take place this afternoon and evening.) It is a big, happy bubble of postwar American optimism.

Her postings on the computer bulletin board America Online were repeated word for word in magazines; her arrests, scandals and the drug overdose of the bassist in her band, Hole, made national headlines. Her travels to Buddhist monasteries and lingerie shops were followed in gossip columns, and speculation about her dalliances and the upbringing of her 2-year-old daughter became a voracious hobby among fans and detractors.    On Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, as Hole taped an \"Unplugged\" performance for broadcast on MTV in April, Ms. Love struck back. \"Look out the window and what do I see?\" she sang in her hoarse growl. \"Dozens of people staring back at me. And it's strange.\" The song, \"Season of the Witch,\" an altered version of the Donovan tune, took on new meaning in light of Ms. Love's ascendancy to most-watched celebrity status.

In his decision, the judge, Okla B.

Concussions are here today, but not necessarily gone tomorrow, which is why Aikman and six other pro quarterbacks convened here today for the most squeamish of seminars.    A panel of doctors was granted an audience this afternoon with Dallas's Aikman, San Francisco's Steve Young and Minnesota's Warren Moon -- to name three -- and, at day's end, there was a recommendation to make concussions a leaguewide headache. Leigh Steinberg, who brainstormed the convention and is the agent for all of the quarterbacks, will submit a proposal to the National Football League's competition committee, and, at the least, he hopes quarterbacks of the future will be treated like punters: gingerly.    Steinberg and his panel of neurologists -- doing much wishful thinking -- will also call for the elimination of artificial turf, a re-evaluation of helmet wear and the inclusion of a sideline medical referee, whose sole job would be to rule on a player's ability to play.    Aikman could easily be the concussion poster boy. He has suffered six in his six-season career, and he can barely recount his most recent Super Bowl. He still wears linebacker Wilber Marshall's fingerprints under his chin -- or helmet prints, to be exact -- and league officials confirmed today there could be rule changes coming that keep quarterbacks upright.    \"How can they possibly help?\" asked Young, the league's reigning most valuable player. \"They're going to make a lineman yell before he hits you?\"    According to the league executive Joe Browne, it is conceivable that the league -- at the behest of its subcommittee on concussions -- will expand a quarterback's safety net next season. Under current rules, pass rushers cannot overtly maim a signal caller in the pass pocket, but can club him outside of that realm. That's exactly why Marshall, the Arizona linebacker, was not penalized or fined after he blasted Aikman last season -- because Aikman had roamed from the so-called pocket -- but that rule might be amended at the league meetings in March.    \"It was pretty intense,\" Aikman said today, recalling Marshall's gruesome, helmet-first assault. \"I don't know if I've recovered yet from that thing.\"    Post-concussion syndrome was a large topic of discussion today, and doctors on the panel tried to clear up several myths. First, team trainers -- when determining the severity of the blow -- should not ask the player if he can remember the score or what he ate for breakfast. It is more helpful, they said, to examine his ability to concentrate by asking him to recite the months of the year backward. If a player conquers that question and then shows no amnesia in the next 20 minutes, he should be allowed to re-enter the game.    The doctors also warned that many quarterbacks can play deftly despite their concussions -- but may not remember one single touchdown pass. This, in fact, is what happened to Aikman in the playoffs of January 1994. He suffered a concussion in the conference championship against San Francisco and still did not have his complete equilibrium for the ensuing Super Bowl against Buffalo.    \"I said at the time had it been a regular season game, I probably wouldn't have played,\" Aikman said today. \"I was having headaches that week. But, for me, it's the Super Bowl. I know you're saying, 'You're an idiot, a moron for playing.' But, to me, it doesn't matter.    \"I remember playing the game, but not much more. My first Super Bowl, I remember everything that took place at the Rose Bowl, and, to this day, everything's clear. The second one in Atlanta, though, I don't have a clear recollection.\"    Doctors today then gave Aikman something else to chew on: concussions make a person more susceptible to Alzheimer's Disease later in life.    \"People this year were asking me, 'When is enough, enough,' \" Aikman said. \"The next one could maybe be my last one. I've said before if it comes to the point that I'm worrying about concussions, I will get out.\"    In the interim, most of the quarterbacks today were not scared away from the sport.     \"We can't make it flag football, can we,\" said Washington's John Friesz, who also joined the Rams' Tommy Maddox, Jacksonville's Andre Ware and Cincinnati's David Klingler at the seminar.     And the only linebacker present this afternoon concurred.    \"Will I let up on quarterbacks now?\" San Francisco's Gary Plummer said, repeating a question. \"No way.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"Driver Out of Big Race","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/sports/sports-people-bobsled-driver-out-of-big-race.html","abstract":"  A year after he was disqualified from the Winter Olympics for a rules violation, the United States bobsled driver BRIAN SHIMER dropped a 675-pound bobsled on his right foot in Lake Placid, N.Y., Wednesday, breaking his big toe and forcing him out of the biggest race of the season, the four-man world championships at Winterberg, Germany.

George Pataki says he is looking for someone who will be sensitive to both environmental and business concerns to head New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation. The trouble is that Mr. Pataki may be on the verge of appointing a Cuomo administration holdover whose track record on environmental matters makes him an inappropriate choice to be chief steward of the state's threatened natural resources.   A \"very strong candidate\" for the top D.E.C. post, according to the Governor, is Michael Zagata. Unlike some of Mr. Pataki's appointees, Mr. Zagata, at least, is not a political crony or relative of one. He served at the D.E.C. under Gov. Mario Cuomo, who named him to the amorphous new position of Business Ambassador just before the election, in an apparent nod to commerce. Before that Mr. Zagata spent 14 years working for various oil and gas companies. He forged a career on the wrong side of some big environmental questions. For example, he advocated the proposal, wisely rejected by Congress, to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. He has also supported a misguided concept called \"mitigation banking,\" which would allow companies to develop protected wetlands on the promise to create new, ecologically suspect sanctuaries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950218","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/18/nyregion/no-headline-202995.html","abstract":"  \"We didn't have a college fund for Michelle.
