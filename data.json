Miss Hong moved along a diagonal path of diffuse light in \"Above and Below,\" a solo set to an atmospheric score for piano and strings by Ki Young Kim.

The piece, which was presented in a semi-staged version at Merkin Concert Hall on Monday evening, was composed at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943. An allegorical portrait of Hitler, the piece was banned when camp authorities saw a rehearsal in 1944. Soon thereafter Ullmann, his librettist, Petr Kien, and the entire cast were sent to Auschwitz where most, including Ullmann died.    Everything about the work, from its subject to its quirky part-classical, part-cabaret instrumentation, was determined by Ullmann's presence in Theresienstadt. Yet it must also be said that \"Der Kaiser von Atlantis\" is also a remarkable, affecting work in purely musical and dramatic terms. Just under an hour long, it tells a complex story in a concise, direct way and in an omnivorous musical language that draws on both classical and popular styles. At times it has the archness of Kurt Weill's German theater music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941124","headline":"Presenting Opposite Approaches","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/24/arts/jazz-review-presenting-opposite-approaches.html","abstract":"  The double bill on Tuesday night at the Knitting Factory demonstrated two approaches to post-modern jazz: witty and concise compositions from Joey Baron alongside unfettered, sprawling pieces from Roscoe Mitchell.

The most inflammatory recommendation by far is that, in carefully defined circumstances, scientists should be able to create embryos solely for research and then destroy them when finished.   That has stirred fears that modern-day Frank-ensteins will soon create, destroy and tinker with life forms just to satisfy their intellectual curiosity. But it strikes this observer that the panel of 19 scientists, ethicists, lawyers and others got the balance just about right.

This fall, the coalition, a nonprofit organization that searches out and promotes outstanding children's videos, published the Kids First Directory. The guide lists about 300 titles chosen by a jury of 200 adults, many of them child-development professionals, and 3,000 children from around the country. Next month a supplement will add 120 titles now being chosen by the jury.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"A Point Guard Leaves in Order to Go Back Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/sports/basketball-a-point-guard-leaves-in-order-to-go-back-home.html","abstract":"  Rafer Alston has the rearview mirror from hell. In it, he sees his father hawking his Michael Jordan rookie card for cash, and his mother not coming to the card's defense. He sees his high school coach waving a basketball uniform, asking him to dive in, but his high school principal snatches it away. He sees his teacher calling roll, and he wants to say, \"Here; I'm here,\" but the teacher calls Felipe Lopez's and Stephon Marbury's names instead. He sees himself rolling the dice, and coming up 7, but no money is in the pot. He sees his brother in prison, his twin sister pregnant and himself with no S.A.T. score.

Trott, the subject of Fritz Baumann's film \"The Journey of the Lion,\" is a Jamaican Rastafarian who lives an impoverished existence with his two children in a shack on the outskirts of Kingston. Disgusted with modern civilization, Brother Howie, as he is known, dreams of repatriation in Africa. Out of the blue one day, he receives a letter from the sister he hasn't seen in 30 years inviting him to visit her in London. Leaving Jamaica for the first time in his life, he embarks on a journey that takes him to England and eventually to Egypt and Ghana.

The rookie right tackle Larry Allen was being haunted by a one-armed man -- Green Bay Packers defensive end Reggie White -- who kept trying to bury his quarterback. Jason Garrett, starting in place of Troy Aikman, kept running for his life. And the Cowboy defense, ranked No. 1 in the National Football League, was in hiding, too.     The Cowboys trailed by 17-6 at the half, and it looked as if the Packers were on their way to a rout. But then the Cowboys sprang to life. Allen got some halftime advice from the injured tackle Erik Williams, Garrett got back to the game plan and the Cowboys ripped off 36 points -- the most in a second half in the team's history -- to beat the Packers by 42-31.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"The View From Anne Boleyn's Window, Including the Bad Bounces","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/sports/IHT-the-view-from-anne-boleyns-window-including-the-bad-bounces.html","abstract":"I must admit to worrying that the game might be stuffy and self- defeating. .\"Imagine this is a church wall in a French or English medieval town,\" said the organizer, Richard Adams, pointing to the indoor court below..It's easy to imagine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"St. John's Milestone (Victory 10) Not an Easy One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/sports/notebook-football-st-john-s-milestone-victory-10-not-an-easy-one.html","abstract":"  St. John's (10-1) achieved its most victories ever in a football season by hanging on to defeat Pace, 20-13, yesterday at Red Storm Field in Jamaica, Queens.

His pictures can seem at a superficial glance mundane, even artless. On the whole, they speak to nothing so much as peace, stability and the quiet meditation on everyday life beyond 19th-century London, a life that can seem very remote to American viewers today. The extravagant paintings of his compatriot and contemporary, Turner, more readily conform to our 20th-century idea of advanced art as idiosyncratic and abstract.   But the simplicity of Constable's work is misleading. On the one hand, there are his famous cloud studies, big oil sketches and some of the late paintings, where pigment is put down with a freedom that can bring to mind the Impressionists. (The French, not coincidentally, admired him before the English did, and more than they did Turner.) And on the other hand, there are the excessively labored pictures Constable painted to win acceptance at the Royal Academy in London. The former are groundbreaking, the latter conformist, and it is this split that makes Constable such a curious and intriguing figure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941125","headline":"Fed Raises Interest Rates on Dubious Grounds; How to Fight Inflation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/25/opinion/l-fed-raises-interest-rates-on-dubious-grounds-how-to-fight-inflation-927872.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   After five interest rate increases this year, the Fed has done it again.

Moreover, Council concerns over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's October proposal that much of the cutting be imposed on social services are justified. But the Council's authority to vote its own plan is ambiguous. Both sides should want the courts to clear up the ambiguity, though it would be risky and costly to delay cuts while courts ruminate.   This confrontation is over political muscle, not fiscal details. The revised City Charter gave the Council substantially more power than before. Up to this point, the Council has not exploited that power aggressively. Now its Democratic majority is embarrassed by its failure to press for more changes in the new Republican Mayor's original budget when it could have done so last June. Members are also angry that he now proposes to cancel some of the few changes they made. June was the time to fight.

What she offers is a sweet, beautifully manipulated and, in her best moments, seductively sensual sound. But much of the time, this sheer vocal beauty comes at a cost in depth. How serious a problem that is depends on what a listener looks for in a recital. There are times, after all, when one is grateful for ravishing vocalism and willing to overlook everything else.    Perhaps the best example of this transaction at work on Tuesday was Haydn's \"Grande Scena di Berenice,\" a showpiece that draws both its form and its energy from touching on emotional extremes, and which demands considerable vocal flexibility. Flexibility was no problem for Miss Caballe. She moved easily between the scene's recitative and aria sections, regulating color and dynamics in much the same way a master instrumentalist might. It was consistently elegant singing. Yet the work's drama and emotionalism seemed locked behind a patrician veneer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941126","headline":"Warsaw Bourse Weathering Plunge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/26/your-money/IHT-warsaw-bourse-weathering-plunge.html","abstract":"INVESTORS who entered the Polish equity market at the beginning of 1993 probably wished that capitalism had arrived in the Baltics sooner.
