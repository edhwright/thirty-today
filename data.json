The world premiere of his Fourth Symphony, a work commissioned by the orchestra, received a warm and enthusiastic reception. And at the conclusion of the concert, there was a prolonged standing ovation.   The acclaim was deserved. Over the course of a long career, Mr. Lutoslawski has established himself as a leading composer of the post-World War II generation, one of a group of Eastern European and Soviet composers (including Gyorgy Ligeti, Gyorgy Kurtag and Alfred Schnittke), whose work has been highly original and idiosyncratic, despite the pressures of Communist regimes. Composers like Shostakovich wrote music that could brilliantly undercut official taste while seeming to satisfy it, but Mr. Lutoslawski, whose First Symphony was banned by Stalinist censors in 1949, led a double compositional life. For many years, he earned money writing radio and film music for the Government while devising his own atonal language and style in solitude.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930208","headline":"Good Enough to Fight, But Not for Citizenship","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/08/nyregion/good-enough-to-fight-but-not-for-citizenship.html","abstract":"  Although his eyes have grown dimmer, the slight, white-haired Filipino veteran vividly remembers taking an oath of allegiance to the United States of America, half a century ago in the mountains of Sara on Iloilo island in the Philippines.

His partner, who liked to be tricky and imaginative, showed these traits in the bidding and then with the opening lead.

DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/09/nyregion/metro-digest-018293.html","abstract":"   NEW YORK CITY  NEW TROUBLES FOR POST SUITOR   The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil suit accusing the New York-based Towers Financial Corporation and its chairman, Steven Hoffenberg, of operating a fraud that used false financial statements to sell more than $400 million in securities. The accusation appears to raise serious doubts about Mr. Hoffenberg's bid to purchase The New York Post, calling into question whether he will be considered a viable buyer of the nation's oldest daily newspaper. A1.  Prospective Post publisher says regulatory problems won't derail purchase of the paper. B3.  For some Tower investors of modest means, brokers inflated assets, the S.E.C. says. B3.  AIDS CURRICULUM IN DISPUTE AGAIN   New York State's top education official has ruled that the New York City Board of Education overstepped its authority and infringed on teachers' rights by requiring that all AIDS education stress abstinence as the most effective means of avoiding the disease. Thomas Sobol, the State Commissioner of Education, overturned a board resolution that he said established a \"stopwatch approach to education\" by dictating how and when teachers should teach about AIDS. A1.  FERNANDEZ MAKES APPEAL IN QUEENS   Schools Chancellor Fernandez is targeting Queens in his lobbying effort to change one vote on the New York City School Board and keep his job as the head of the country's largest school system. In a brief, closed-door meeting with the seven-member board, Mr. Fernandez responsed to a board critique of his leadership, part of a formal review of his performance. B2.  COLD AND FLU STRAIN CITY HOSPITALS   The recent frigid weather and an outbreak of the flu have put a strain on New York City's medical services -- overloading ambulances and some emergency rooms, and raising fears among hospital officials of a return to the gridlock of 1989 when waits for beds were as long as four days. B3.  REGION  NEW REALITIES IN CONNECTICUT  When Congress restored $2 billion last summer to the all-but-scuttled Seawolf submarine program at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Bill Sullivan immediately felt the blip. His General Motors dealership in nearby New London ended the year selling more cars than any year since 1987, but most of the sales were for used cars. Similar fault lines are everywhere in Groton, as the most Pentagon-dependent corner of the nation shudders and shakes toward a future after the cold war. In many ways it is a story of waiting for the worst. A1.  CLOSING ARGUMENTS IN GLEN RIDGE CASE   As the Glen Ridge, N.J., sex assault trial in Newark entered its final phases, the first of four defense lawyers began closing arguments by attacking the credibility of two of the state's expert witnesses and stressing inconsistent testimony about the mental capabilities of the mildly retarded woman at the heart of the case. B5.  A DINNER FIGHT, WITH A FEMINIST SLANT   A group of 20 prominent women in Norwalk, including the president of the League of Women Voters, is trying to put an end to what it believes is Connecticut's largest men-only function, the Norwalk Catholic Club's Lincoln Day dinner.

For Marie Antoinette (before revolutionists decided to shorten her a little) Arcadia was a rural cottage a la mode, with milkmaids all in silk.   For two nights and a day on Friday and Saturday, Nicholas McGegan, four other musicians, two singers, two speakers and three lecturers told audiences at the Metropolitan Museum about another set of artistic daydreamers. Their patron was an expatriate Swedish Queen, and the organization -- founded in Rome in 1690 and consisting of musicians, poets, artists and thinkers -- called itself the Arcadian Academy.

Ogden Nash wrote:   Do you, my poppet, feel infirm?   You probably contain a germ.    Can one germ really make you sick?     A.  The number of microbes needed to make someone sick depends on the infective organism and varies greatly, said Dr. Robert Quackenbush, a bacteriologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.   \"The most infective is shigella,\" Dr. Quackenbush said. In some cases, only 1 or perhaps 1 to 10 bacteria would be enough to cause a form of dysentery called shigellosis, he said.    The disease germ, which is closely related to E. coli, a common bacterium in the gut, lurks in the feces of infected people and can be very easily spread. It is an increasing problem in institutions like day-care centers and nursing homes if hands are not washed religiously. Infected people should be cared for in isolation until their feces are found to be free of the causative bacteria, medical authorities say.    A rarer disease called Q fever is caused by an organism called Coxiella burnetti that is also infectious in fairly low numbers, Dr. Quackenbush said.

As wary as a cat, she is careful about not getting too close to anyone, including her boyfriend (Todd Weeks), who delivers pizza. He passes for normal in this depressed Philadelphia suburb, though anywhere else he might be considered an outsider.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930210","headline":"LABORITE TARGET: EUROPEAN TREATY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/world/laborite-target-european-treaty.html","abstract":"  The Labor Party has decided to oppose the Conservative Government on a key point that could complicate and even threaten Britain's ratification of the treaty to achieve monetary and political unity in Europe.

Wood have never been insiders at the American Bar Association, one had to strain even to hear their names at the latest gathering of the bar group here this week.   Schedules for the gatherings are set months in advance, so nothing was on the formal agenda concerning President Clinton's tortured search for an Attorney General and the two women's roles in it. What talk there was of the Attorney General problem was confined to the corridors, and as the convention progressed, indignation seemed to yield to impatience. Problem Called 'Passe'    By Monday night, Caralee T. Neville, a trial judge from Minneapolis, was calling the imbroglio \"sort of passe.\" \"Everyone thinks it's time we just get someone in that office,\" she said at a reception in the Massachusetts Statehouse.   Gathering twice a year, with many smaller conclaves in between, the bar association is, in the words of Evan Davis, onetime counsel to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, \"a very family kind of organization.\"   It is a family, moreover, to which neither Ms. Baird nor Judge Wood has strong blood ties. Ms. Baird's only arguably memorable appearance here, for instance, came last summer, when she spoke on \"quality billing versus hourly billing.\"   All told, there were far more pockets of pity for Judge Wood who, everyone seemed to agree, earned far less and acted far more properly but was treated far more shabbily by the Clinton Administration than was Ms. Baird.   \"I was uneasy about Zoe Baird, because an Attorney General has to be cleaner than clean,\" said Barbara M. Mayden of New York, one of those who was still worked up over the subject. \"But what happened to Kimba Wood sent people reeling. It's like the Administration cut and run.\"   But bar members seemed far more sympathetic to Brooksley E. Born of Washington, the bar governor who was conspicuously passed over for Attorney General, than to either Ms. Baird or Judge Wood, who sits on the Federal District Court in New York.   And they talked as much about Jamie S. Gorelick, another Washington lawyer and bar association stalwart on the latest Clinton list, as of any of the also-rans. One lawyer called the 42-year-old Ms. Gorelick, who represents the District of Columbia Bar Association in the A.B.A.'s House of Delegates, \"Zoe with a green card.\"   If conversations on the topic were peculiarly passionless, they were also surprisingly diffuse. Quickly, they spilled over from the specifics of the two cases to the hazards of hiring undocumented help, the pitfalls of seeking public office in an age of poorly defined and ever-changing morality, and the clumsiness of the Administration and its own house counsel. Black Eye for Lawyers    Some people lamented what they deemed as yet another black eye for the legal profession. \"Here we are, a noble profession, that wants to be part of the Clinton effort, and yet here's our department, the    Justice    Department, and they can't find anybody clean enough to run it,\" said Llewelyn G. Pritchard of Seattle. \"Everyone they pick has some fatal flaw.\"   Robert N. Sayler, a Washington lawyer whose partner, Charles Ruff, also fell headlong on the issue of failing to pay Social Security taxes for a woman in his employ, called the experience \"terribly embarrassing.\"   \"I don't think it follows from the facts but the public thinks, 'We always said lawyers were sleazy, and this proves it two more times,' \" he said.    The drama also provided humorous campaign fodder for bar politicians. Campaigning for chairman of the House of Delegates, Hector Reichard Jr. of San Juan, P.R., assured bar members that he had never hired any illegal aliens from the United States mainland.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930210","headline":"No Cuts in City For Chauffeurs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/us/no-cuts-in-city-for-chauffeurs.html","abstract":"  With President Clinton's cuts in White House staff privileges, there will now be more chauffeur-driven cars for staff members at New York City Hall than at the White House.

There he is seven years ago, crawling under a toppled, 35-ton crane in mid-Manhattan to comfort a woman pinned beneath it for hours, her legs crushed. There he is again, this time in a flooded elevator shaft on Madison Avenue, fashioning a garden hose into a snorkel and then wading with it over to a trapped maintenance worker so that he can breathe until further help arrives. The next scene is at an abortion clinic, where he uses the scissors on his Swiss Army knife to tinker with a bomb, wired to 15 sticks of dynamite, which he disarms with only 11 seconds to spare.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930210","headline":"Palestinian
