This was bracing compensation for the middling performance of Mozart's \"Nozze di Figaro\" that opened the hallon Wednesday evening.   In fact, \"Onegin\" received precisely the kind of staging and performance that made Glyndebourne's worldwide reputation. Graham Vick, the festival's director of productions, revealed an almost Classical refinement under the surface of this Romantic opera. Its tale of thwarted love unfolded through a series of spare, eloquently sung scenes. Onegin's first-act rejection of Tatyana, for example, was mirrored by Tatyana's third-act rejection of Onegin: in each scene, both characters sat in chairs on opposite corners of a nearly bare stage. Also, each act was clearly divided into a public scene of festive celebration and a private scene of confrontation and confession. Andrew Davis's conducting of the London Philharmonic, along with an ensemble of striking singers, gave passion and flesh to the director's formalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940604","headline":"1944: Embassy Shelter?: IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/04/opinion/IHT-1944-embassy-shelter-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"MADRID - [From our New York edition:] Reports from Vichy said tonight [June 3] that Chief of Government Pierre Leval has ordered confiscation of the American Embassy building at Paris to provide shelter for bombed-out French families.

While it is certainly true that Cuba has beautiful beaches, tourists who choose to go there should be aware that by spending dollars, they are helping one of the most brutal regimes since Stalin to remain in power. Recently, the Castro Government legalized the dollar. Before this, Cubans could be imprisoned for merely possessing a few dollars. The Government legalized the dollar because the economy is collapsing and the people starving. This, on a tropical island capable of producing two, if not three, harvests per year.

Allen Johnson led an American sweep in the 110-meter hurdles with a stadium record of 13.50. The world record-holder, Mike Powell, won the long jump with a leap of 25 feet 11 inches. (AP) Williams Paces Runners at M.A.C.: Louann Williams, running for the Caribbean Connection Track Club, successfully defended her sprint titles yesterday in the Coors/Metropolitan Athletics Congress outdoor men's and women's track and field championships at St. John's University. Williams, who has completed two years of junior college, won the 100 meters in 12.22 seconds and the 200 in 24.08 seconds. Both times were well off the Brooklyn resident's national junior records of 11.22 seconds and 22.70 seconds, respectively. Jawanna McMullen, the Christ the King High School standout sophomore, finished fourth (55.20 seconds) in the 400 meters won by Jessica Hudson in 54.40 seconds. In men's events, Andrew Bloom took the shot-put at 60 feet 1 inch and the discus at 184-3; Robert Ayres of Seton Hall was first in the 800 meters in 1 minute 50.82 seconds and Troy McIntosh of Morgan State was the 400-meter winner in 47.46 seconds. SOCCER  Belgian Player Stars in Debut  Josip Weber scored five goals in his international debut, leading Belgium to a 9-0 rout of Zambia last night in Brussels in the country's largest margin of victory since it began playing international soccer in 1904. The 29-year-old Weber, who was born in Croatia, received Belgian citizenship on March 12.

The incident was just one sign of how the debate over Dr. Davis's leadership has become bitter and personal and public, to a point rarely seen on a college campus. It has raised issues of race and sex, spilled into the surrounding community of Jamaica, Queens, and pitted some local black leaders against the largely white faculty. So heightened have tensions become that the office of W. Ann Reynolds, Chancellor of the City University of New York, is trying to bring the two sides together, at the request of the faculty and staff. A School's Stability    In recent months, faculty and staff members have complained that many senior staff members have quit, raising concern about the institution's stability, and that Dr. Davis has made personnel decisions without the usual consultation with department faculty members. The faculty caucus had considered a vote of censure against her after three years of escalating tension. Instead, it decided to conduct an evaluation, a lesser step, but postponed it when the caucus president, Dr. James Donald Wynne, was killed by a car on May 17.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"A Wizard Shows Some (But Not All) Of His Secrets","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/arts/classical-music-a-wizard-shows-some-but-not-all-of-his-secrets.html","abstract":"  HMM.

And since mid-April, when Kidder, Peabody & Company accused him of orchestrating a $350 million fraud and dismissed him, placing him at the center of one of Wall Street's biggest scandals, Mr. Jett has been more isolated than ever.   For the first time since that scandal unfolded, Mr. Jett, 36, is speaking out about himself, his upbringing, his career on Wall Street and his ordeal at Kidder. Only months ago, he was Kidder's employee of the year -- a star trader who earned a $9 million bonus in 1993.

Both were characters in stunning productions of French Baroque opera directed by Jean-Marie Villegier and conducted by William Christie. And both, for all their differences, wore costumes and wigs of 17th-century French nobility, and looked as if they had stepped out of the court of Louis XIV.   This plumage was not precisely what the composers, Jean-Baptiste Lully (in \"Atys\") and Marc-Antoine Charpentier (in \"Medee\"), had in mind. Nor did Mr. Villegier heed the librettists' calls for scenic mountains, waterfalls and gardens. \"Atys\" took place in a windowless marble-paneled room at Versailles; \"Medee,\" in a brick church on a French nobleman's estate. But these radical restagings were not typical examples of directorial creativity. They created brilliant counterpoint to the supple performances, perhaps permanently changing the way these operas are thought about by those lucky enough to have been present. The genius lay in recognizing that both works are inseparable from the court of the Sun King, where they had their origins. \"Atys\" was first performed in 1676, \"Medee\" in 1693.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"Sylvia Hargrave And David Kelly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/style/weddings-sylvia-hargrave-and-david-kelly.html","abstract":"  Dr. Sylvia Lynn Hargrave, the daughter of Clara J.

Are audio books another stop along the way to illiteracy, or are they paradise enough for readers who just want something fun to do while driving to the beach or walking the dog? Millions are listening to books on cassettes these days, whether they buy them in bookstores, rent them or borrow them from public libraries. But what to buy or borrow? Most spoken-word material is pretty much junk food for the ear. Go to a big chain bookstore and you'll find generous supplies of Danielle Steel, badly abridged classics, autobiographies of movie stars, advice on how to enhance your wealth or reduce your weight -- all the same stuff, in fact, that keeps book publishers going. For the wretched excess of the season, there's even a newly released tape featuring graphic descriptions of the art of serial killing -- in the killer's own words! \n\nBut dreary as some of this sleaze is, there are bright spots -- honest entertainment on audio and even some series that are attempting to introduce new writers to new audiences. Only the worst sort of snob would sniff at abridging books that were never great literature in the first place. Listen, for example, to Peter Mayle reading his three-hour shortened version of \"A Year in Provence\" and \"Toujours Provence\" (Audio Renaissance, $29.95), with Patrick Macnee providing transitions between the amusing tales about an English couple adjusting to life in the French Midi, and it turns out you haven't missed much. And even some sprawling classics are an endurance test to listen to. They were written for the eye, after all, and work better trimmed down for the ear. One of the big sellers now, probably thanks to the recent television series, is a six-hour abridgment of George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" (Penguin-Highbridge Audio, $24).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"The Jefferson Market Courthouse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/realestate/l-the-jefferson-market-courthouse-278475.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your splendid article about the old Jefferson Market Courthouse  [ \"A Stopped Clock Sired the Preservation Movement,\" April 3 ] , in which is now housed the Greenwich Village public library, brought back a flood of memories.

The failing grade will be restored and teachers will be encouraged to award C's and D's when deserved. Those two letters had virtually disappeared from the dazzling but misleading transcripts that a generation of students at Stanford (and plenty of other places) had used to impress parents, employers and graduate school deans.    The hope is that Stanford's decision to jettison a system that failed equally to reward excellence and punish indifference will be emulated throughout the educational system -- not only in elite colleges where rampant grade inflation has destroyed the idea of merit but also in secondary and elementary schools. The sad truth is that Stanford's permissive practices were merely the final expression of a sensibility that seeks foremost to eliminate the fear of failure, holds that feeling good is more important than doing well and assumes that somehow students can be injected with self-esteem rather than earning it by honest toil.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"Turn On, Tune In, Interface","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/books/turn-on-tune-in-interface.html","abstract":"  THE INTERNET COMPLETE REFERENCE By Harley Hahn and Rick Stout. 817 pp. Berkeley, Calif.: Osborne McGraw-Hill.

Explorer, anthropologist, geography teacher and raconteur all in one, the travel writer was a paid importer of experience who delivered the exotic right to the home table, like so much tropical fruit in winter.   Norman Lewis's new book, AN EMPIRE OF THE EAST: Travels in Indonesia (John Macrae/Holt, $25), sets itself squarely in this generalist tradition. Mr. Lewis, an Englishman and seasoned travel writer, provides a classic narrative of manners, history and scenery from the land of more than 13,000 islands. Here are \"splendid\" views of palm-fringed lagoons; of Sumatran rice paddies where storks and egrets delicately step; of sinister mangrove swamps and a mosque abandoned to the jungle. Fruit bats, wings tied with twine, hang from roadside trees, sold to make a stew used as a cure for asthma. (Mr. Lewis gives this a miss, but makes up for it by breakfasting on chopped octopus and strawberries.) Of Indonesians, we learn that they will twist themselves into knots to avoid being the bearers of bad news; that their sense of humor tends to the slapstick; that traditional hunting rituals feature a shaman conjuring up the spirit of a monkey and apologizing for its imminent death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"On West 57th, a Confederacy of Kitsch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-critic-s-notebook-on-west-57th-a-confederacy-of-kitsch.html","abstract":"  NEW YORK CITY thrives on change, but sometimes the changes are hard to swallow.

Most settle for mere table scraps and produce a dog's breakfast of well-chewed erudition and insight. Others persist, terrierlike, until a prize like Bowser's \"Man Writes Dog\" (Westminster Press) is carried in one day and dropped beside one's Morris chair. You are invited to devour the leftovers here presented. Perhaps they do reek a bit of age. Perhaps home videos like \"Rex Takes a Bath\" have supplanted these solemnly formal 19th-century figures and their hygienically disadvantaged 19th-century lives. These seem, indeed, a different breed; in fact, diverse breeds. But mind that somebody once loved each and every one of them. And that their rich lives, lived out among the alpha figures of world literature, render our own comings and goings as so much figurative frolicking with so many metaphorical squeaky toys. IGOT SUCHANITCH   \"Ankle-biting cur!\" Pushkin shoved him out for ingratitude. Even kindly Chekhov finally tired of his yapping and passed him on to Dostoyevsky, who was driven to such despair by the ensuing domestic disruptions that he threw himself into writing \"Crime and Punishment\" \"just to escape into a happier realm,\" he later confessed. In the light of modern science, Suchanitch's didoes become understandable; he was almost certainly being driven half-mad by fleas. Not that the German-bred mischief-maker was without charm: that rakishly unkempt silvery-gray mane, those big, sparkling brown eyes, a restless bounding energy -- amid the pride of solemn literary lions of 19th-century St. Petersburg, he was a gay dog indeed. Alas, his literary output amounted to one brilliant, anguished fusillade against cats, \"Nyatski!\" (\"Hiss!\"), before he was drawn to science and became involved in psychological experiments -- to his everlasting regret -- with one Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, M.D. FIONA PURINA   Irish by descent, but adopted at a mere 8 weeks by a noble Italian family and raised in Rome, Fiona Purina was a creature of fierce territorial instincts who quickly made Roman society her jealous domain. But no pampered lap dog, she. Fiona was an agitator by the age of 6 and soon an outspoken essayist and pamphleteer against any and all abridgments of freedom for her and her kind. Yet the haughty household princess spurned the advances of what she called \"mongrels and strays\" and became the mistress of Garibaldi's pet, Pepe, who was sleek as a greyhound. But he was unable or unwilling to be monogamous; soon the fur flew, and the relationship ended in a veritable dogfight. Purina failed to mellow with age. Having impetuously wet King Umberto's pants leg, she was banished in disgrace to the countryside near Reggio Calabria. There she whiled away her remaining years, dozing in the sun in the dooryard, dreaming of the glory that had been Rome. SIR WAGSTAFF BARKER   Late-19th-century English letters owe Sir Wagstaff Barker much; it was he who once rescued the infant Chesterton from drowning in the Solent during a family picnic. Sir Wagstaff never spoke of his mother -- by all accounts a classic bitch, for all her impeccable breeding -- and never knew his father. Perhaps this explains a life of ceaseless wandering and almost suicidal athleticism. Certainly, a robust physicality (\"Muscular Canininity,\" Kipling called it) informed Barker's days and works. Up and out into the nearby woodlands before sunrise to splash through marsh and fen until exhausted, Barker lived and breathed and ate and celebrated nature with animal gusto to the end of his days. Indeed, his longtime companion, John Buchan, in whose household he was to become a permanent guest, thought he detected something obsessive in the big fellow's tireless pursuits. \"Birds and squirrels, squirrels and birds,\" he fulminated in his diary. \"He can think, he can dream, of nothing else.\" AMELIA UPLAND   \"Her long, wet nose quivers so,\" wrote Queen Victoria to a daughter after an audience with the shy and reclusive Amelia Upland, \"and her hair feels like a rug; yet even Rosebery  [ that is, the Earl of Rosebery, Prime Minister 1894-95 ]  is compelled to pat her on her head!\" The severe bombazine dress in this undated portrait symbolizes Miss Amelia Upland's austere spinsterhood, for an operation at an early age had made all hopes of a family impossible. Her long life was one ceaseless quest for affection, expressed in poems -- \"Bath Day,\" \"Comes the Cook,\" \"A Rumor of Mange\" -- that returned, again and again and yet again, to her beloved themes of family life in the Lake Country of her youth. Miss Upland seldom left her cozy corner under the stairs in the house where she was born, except to go swimming, and yet seldom has one so retiring been so widely loved. \"About life she had an acute sensitivity,\" eulogized England's poet laureate upon her passing, \"and her sense of smell was nothing to sneeze at, either.\" HECTOR LE CHIEN   Runt of a brawling Billancourt litter and cast out early to seek his own fate, Hector Le Chien soon made Montmartre his neighborhood and its fin de siecle boites and cafes his home. \"Mascot of the Demimonde,\" Zola called the pint-sized hobbledehoy. Le Chien was a beggar and a thief, notorious for his raffish demeanor (he was never known to bathe), his bad breath and a habit of furiously scratching himself until the furniture rattled. Small wonder that he was always in somebody's doghouse. Yet among Montmartre's innumerable poets and troubadours, his was a unique voice: keening his agonies and needs in impromptu recitals in one smoky cafe or another, he could still a room. Then, as the sympathy and praise engulfed him, Hector would invariably roll over onto his back, legs in the air, his mouth twisted into an otherworldly rictus of a grin. The stale croissant, the heel of a baguette that inevitably followed, were sustenance. For body and soul. BONAR KENNELWORTH KERR   \"Man has no better friend,\" warbled Thoreau. \"He gobbles his food,\" hissed Emily Dickinson. \"He spoke a language even I don't understand,\" harrumphed Edmund Wilson, whose massive critical surveys of American letters fail to so much as throw a bone to Bonar Kennelworth Kerr. True, his poems today may scan like doggerel, but in the New England of more than a hundred years ago, literary luminaries from Boston to Concord would instantly lay their papers down whenever Kennelworth Kerr came calling. His visits were memorable. \"That damnable animal Kennelworth comes by,\" huffed Longfellow, \"jumping up on the maid at the mere sight of some mutton scraps, bolting his meal, then licking her hands and face in a disgusting excess of what some call affection but I call servility.\" His biographer, Kibble, speculates that it was Mark Twain who taught him to smoke cigars as a parlor trick. Alas, it banished him thereafter from the salons and parlors of fastidious literary Boston, and his twilight years were spent snuffling for butts in the alleyways of Roxbury.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"The Big Top Returns To Connecticut Towns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/nyregion/the-big-top-returns-to-connecticut-towns.html","abstract":"  SOME people may still remember how in the 1930's and 40's the long, gleaming silver train of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus would roll into railroad yards in June, usually in the middle of the night.

Traditionally Ringling Brothers would start its Connecticut run in Stamford and then make stops in Bridgeport, Waterbury, New Haven, New London, Hartford and some smaller towns, mostly for one-day, two-show stands. Smaller circuses, such as King Brothers, Cole Brothers and the Clyde Beatty Circus, featuring the animal trainer, also visited the state often. But on July 6, 1944, a fire swept through a tent crowded with more than 6,000 people during a Ringling Brothers matineee performance on a vacant city-owned lot on Barbour Stret in Hartford.

They do not want to pack themselves into an airplane, preferring to put kids, seats and luggage into the van and drive off. The other requirements are rather simple. The twins are happy for hours at a time if they can play in the water, the mother said, so a hotel or resort with an indoor pool is protection for rainy days. The couple, both employed, are rather informal, but they do not want to rent a cabin and cook or clean. And they do not want to spend a lot of money.    There should be a hundred solutions, given the rich variety of resorts within a day's drive of New York. Calls to a few hotels with advertising directed toward families produced a peculiar result: Some resorts that cater to families advertise a calm adult dinner with children in a separate dining room. But such resorts, in high season, do not want children so young they cannot eat separately from their parents. We will love you in May or September, they told the parents, but not in summer. The couple tried several travel agents, but found their recommendations high priced and offhand. In a mountain of brochures, nothing appealed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"U.S. Virgin Islands Tighten Tourist Security","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-us-virgin-islands-tighten-tourist.html","abstract":"  RESPONDING to a spate of recent attacks on tourists, including a pair of robberies that ended in shooting deaths, authorities in this American territory in the heart of the Caribbean are beefing up the police force, cracking down on juvenile crime, preparing a safety advisory and taking other measures intended to better protect the visitors on whom the islands' economy depends.

Everybody's either writing about native plants or saving water or healing the mind and body with wild plants found in the rain forest or Central Park. Some of these books are by people bent on defining the New American Garden (a catchy phrase that ought to be dropped right now), which has to be based on native plants. Though I'd love to, I don't yet see native grasses rising up out of the lawns in Hempstead, the only part of Long Island that once had a prairie, but there's certainly a different wind blowing this year. Instead of searching for the biggest white German bearded irises to stuff into a knockoff of Vita Sackville-West's white garden, gardeners are going back to their local historical societies to get a sense of how the land looked and what insects and animals lived on it before the suburbs, searching out the native viburnums and mulleins growing along the roadside and planting buffalo grass where the Kentucky blue used to go.   In THE NATURAL HABITAT GARDEN (Clarkson Potter, $40), by Ken Druse with Margaret Roach, the reader is led through American gardens that reflect terrain, climate and plants that were far more evident to Lewis and Clark than they are now to the average family driving across the continent.

Now whittled down to a distinctive pick-ax shape, Sylt -- Germans pronounce it Zult, which sounds more or less like zoolt -- has spent the better part of the millennium losing its battle with the wind and waves of the North Sea, while in the last few decades becoming a point of pilgrimage for Germany's moneyed classes.    The island can prompt strong feelings among Germans, some of whom perceive it as a symbol of the country's celebrated post-war wealth, and some of whom see it as a symbol of the evasions they believe that wealth tried to buy. Its reputation as an enclave of the rich, though, probably has more to do with attitude than with real expense. Most of the accommodations are in a medium price range ($46 to $87 a night), and the restaurants, which maintain a standard unusually high for Germany, are often quite reasonable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"Women's Final Off Till Today","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/sports/tennis-women-s-final-off-till-today.html","abstract":"  As unrelenting as Mary Pierce's forehand missiles, as steady as Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's topspin, the weather delivered a knockout blow to the women's French Open final this afternoon.

The bodega, at 2839 Decatur Avenue, has been the target of at least two police raids in the past year. A boycott has been organized to stop drug sales reported in and around the store and the city has tried to close the place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940605","headline":"As Big Farms Fade, Niche Farmers Bloom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/realestate/as-big-farms-fade-niche-farmers-bloom.html","abstract":"  FROM the roadside, Longneck Farms looks like many of the small horse or produce farms in and around Colts Neck, a small rural town in central New Jersey's Monmouth County.

Pavel Kuka scored twice and midfielder Jan Suchoparek scored a third goal as the Czechs found holes in the Irish defense. Andy Townsend scored a first-half goal for Ireland. The defeat follows three impressive performances, a 1-0 victory in the Netherlands, a 1-0 home triumph over Bolivia and a 2-0 victory in Germany against the defending World Cup champion. The Czechs did not qualify for the World Cup. Ireland opens its World Cup schedule on June 18 against Italy at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP) Sweden Wins Nordic Cup: In Stockholm, striker Tomas Brolin struck twice within six minutes early in the second half as Sweden beat Norway, 2-0, to win the three-nation Nordic Cup tournament. It was the last exhibition before the World Cup finals for Norway, which plays Mexico in its opening game in Washington June 19.

Berdusco, who entered in the 62d minute, sent the crowd of 51,930 into a frenzy when he hammered a shot high into the left corner over Brazilian goalie Claudio Taffarel.

These two sang in English, perfect for a generation of youth yearning to define themselves in opposition to whatever their parents and their immigrant culture represented. Ten years later teen-agers are listening to India, now known as La India, and Marc Anthony. But La India (Linda Caballero) and Marc Anthony (Marco Antonio Muniz) are singing salsa, the music of (gasp) their parents. And Hispanic youth are flocking to it.   \"I used to be so embarrassed by salsa, I wasn't into it,\" said La India, who performs tonight at S.O.B.'s, with her orchestra.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940606","headline":"Commencements; College of S.I.

Mr. Coleman has been doing this for a while now, and it was fascinating to see how far he has taken the idea. His formula has stayed the same, but he has made it all more complex and pliable, with pieces weaving in and out of one another and inspiring fervent improvisations. But its limitations have stayed the same.   At the opening of its five-night stand, the band -- featuring Ravi Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Andy Milne on piano, Reggie Washington on bass and Gene Lake on drums -- never lost some of the chill that Mr. Coleman's music often has. As able as the musicians are at playing the music, with its difficult meters and distinct rhythmic conception, the group rarely raised it above the level of a musician's exercise, technically interesting but mostly mute emotionally.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940606","headline":"Heroin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/06/nyregion/pulse-heroin.html","abstract":"  Heroin use and its dire effects appear to be on the rise as the drug has become cheaper, stronger and more widely available.
