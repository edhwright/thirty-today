Whitney's \"On the Rhine, Commerce and Romance\" (Aug. 1) gave us the opportunity to relive our Christmas cruise on the Koln-Dusseldorfer Line's Deutschland. In 1990, we spent a week sailing from Cologne to Strasbourg and back -- one of our most memorable travel experiences. We have both lived and worked in Europe and were delighted to discover that, with fellow passengers representing 12 countries, this was a European's experience of the Rhine, not a canned, sanitized American group tour. The staff regarded us as international travelers, not as American tourists.   The author's reference to the 9-year-old boy as the only one to brave the small heated swimming pool on the top deck brought to mind a Christmas morning swim with a couple from England, who were our tablemates. On Christmas Eve, we arranged to have our dining steward deliver a bottle of Champagne and four glasses to poolside promptly at 9 A.M. The following morning, clad only in swimwear, we raced up the steps to the pool, braving the 20-something-degree outside temperature and a light frozen mist. The 85-degree pool water temperature made the mad dash worth the effort. Moments later, the steward arrived with the Champagne, which he served with European flair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"Back to the Round Table With Dorothy Parker and Pals. . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/movies/film-back-to-the-round-table-with-dorothy-parker-and-pals.html","abstract":"  It's not hard to imagine how Dorothy Parker would have responded to the current fuss surrounding her 100th birthday.

So, too, did about 20 of her closest friends, including the theater critics Robert Benchley and Alexander Woollcott, the playwright Robert Sherwood, the columnist Franklin P. Adams and the novelist Edna Ferber. For the better part of the 1920's, they lunched together at the Rose Room of the Algonquin Hotel on West 44th Street in Manhattan, nursing one another's hangovers and matching witticisms.

Nylander, the director of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, invites her readers to enjoy her copious knowledge of the interiors and domestic management of late-18th-century New England homes. The imaginatively illustrated OUR OWN SNUG FIRESIDE: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860 (Knopf, $30) is dedicated to the notion that the details of everyday life form the core of human experience. The author uses artifacts and literary and graphic recollections of 19th-century New Englanders to describe in rich detail a ceaseless round of household activities. She explicates the laborious processes by which New Englanders produced their food, clothing and light and kept themselves clean and warm. Ms. Nylander walks the reader through heating a New England home in winter, preparing an 18th-century dinner and washing and ironing the colonial laundry. Although Ms. Nylander warns of the 19th-century antiquarians' tendency to idealize and sentimentalize an undemocratic age, she does not screen her own firesides from these same weaknesses. Here and there a disturbing shadow flickers across the cheery, blazing hearth -- for example, the black mother who retrieves her daughter from service with a white family despite the mistress's protests. These and other scenes go unremarked upon, but the shadows remind us of other New England firesides, not so snug yet equally our own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"'Graceful Illumination'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/arts/l-john-cage-graceful-illumination-157593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   What a profound tribute Margaret Leng Tan has paid to her teacher and mentor  [ \"John Cage Poses a Few Last Questions,\" Aug. 1 ] .

Disasters, natural and otherwise, have been hammering the city ever since. The other day a man in a midtown delicatessen complained about being charged $7.50 for a plate of bacon and eggs. He was reminded that this was New York.   \"It's a tough town and it's gettin' tougher,\" he was told. \"Pay the cashier.\"   In February the World Trade Center was bombed. The idea was to terrorize New Yorkers and it sure did. Six people were killed, other plots were uncovered and local television producers were struck by an uncontrollable and apparently permanent urge to run clips of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman on virtually every newscast.   In the haphazard and radically democratic world of local TV news, the sheik became as familiar a figure as Joey Buttafuoco.   In March came the Blizzard of '93. Winds at La Guardia Airport reached 71 miles per hour. Nearly a foot of snow fell. Once again garbage cans and umbrellas were blown about indiscriminately. The National Weather Service warned, \"This could be the worst storm of the century.\"   When it was over, New Yorkers looked up, shook it off and moved on to other terrible occurrences. That is what it's like here. Life in New York is all about combat readiness, the joy of survival. Ordinary storms aren't even noticed. Only storms of the century get our attention.   This is a point of great pride. It sustains us. New Yorkers are the elite corps of urban dwellers. We are masterful at handling crises for that is our normal state of affairs. What's a blizzard to someone faced with a lifetime of alternate side of the street parking?   There was a lull in the spring. The weather was gorgeous. It was a time to relax, recuperate and prepare for the onslaught of July. We weren't disappointed. Temperatures rose into the hundreds and then we were given a state report on Crown Heights that returned us to the familiar terrain of racial strife.   \"Sometimes,\" said a video store clerk in Greenwich village, \"I feel like we're living in an insane asylum.\"   A customer looked up and said, \"Most of the time.\"   Even sports fans have suffered. The city has the worst team in baseball, a team distinguished by a leadoff hitter (soon to be fired) who amused himself by tossing an explosive device at a group of fans, and a pitcher who got his kicks by spraying bleach on a group of reporters.   The other baseball team is threatening to leave town altogether.   There's more. Police corruption hearings have been scheduled, incredibly, for the month before the mayoral election; teachers are threatening to strike; the Board of Education has problems convincing anyone to come run the school system, and we've been told that tests to determine if the schools are safe from asbestos were so unreliable that they are worthless.   This is madness, right?   No doubt. Nevertheless, the madness called New York has its own strange allure. It's a madness millions of us are unwilling to relinquish. Dealing with the problems of New York -- some of them so crazy they can leave you breathless -- is what defines New Yorkers. This is not a town for the faint of heart.   And the compensations -- the night out, the discovery of a good, cheap restaurant, the concert in Central Park, the Knicks game -- are savored all the more because this is a place where nothing comes easy.   True New Yorkers, when out of town, are like warriors on leave. You've got a thousand stories that will amaze your listeners. You assure them that they're all true. They really are. Then it's time to return. And no matter how cynical you may be it's hard not to get a thrill when, flying home after a breather, that skyline rises up again to greet you.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"DINING OUT;\nA Taste of Europe, in Generous Portions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/nyregion/dining-out-a-taste-of-europe-in-generous-portions.html","abstract":"IN Italian, Il Gusto D'Europa, the name of Evan Kelish's 15-month-old restaurant in Little Silver, means a taste of Europe, and that is exactly what he offers his customers.

The Californians lost last year's title game on the field, 15-4. (AP) TENNIS","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"Ads to Die For?

These features are typical of the north shore of Long Island Sound, which is made up of a mosaic of small harbors, points, islands and submerged reefs.

Were the orders for a Scottish disaster written upon it -- Flodden Field, or the Massacre of Glencoe? Or is it derived from the nine lozenges on the arms of the Earl of Stair, much loathed in Scotland for his connection with Glencoe and the union with England?   But there is no doubt at all about why the eight of diamonds is known as the Curse of Silverman. A year ago that card cost Neil Silverman and his team a victory in the Spingold Knockout Teams. He was playing in seven diamonds, with a trump suit of K-7-6-3-2 opposite dummy's A-Q-10-9.

Nobody can follow all the myriad permutations in reggae fashion, not only in Jamaica but in New York and London as well. Yet broad currents are evident. Right now, reggae permeates pop more than it has since the death of Bob Marley in 1981, and interest in both classic and progressive reggae runs high. Club hits like Mad Cobra's \"Flex\" and crossover numbers like Snow's \"Informer\" arrive too frequently to be isolated phenomena anymore.    By coincidence, two acts that bend reggae's past toward its future have recently released superior albums. Shaggy's debut, \"Pure Pleasure\" (Virgin 87953; CD and cassette), has enough outsized vitality and infectious tunes to show that the reggae variant called dancehall is more than an erratic singles factory. With the runaway hit \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" in tow, UB40's \"Promises and Lies\" (Virgin 88229; CD and cassette) updates the band's 15 years of subtle arrangements and seductive vocals into a collection that, now at No. 8 on the Billboard pop chart, promises to become one of the best-selling reggae albums of all time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"Shadow Play","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/style/on-the-street-shadow-play.html","abstract":"  As August fades, the sidewalks are filled with long black shadows suggesting Giacometti sculptures. Or could it be that Morticia, the macabre Charles Addams character, is putting out her own line of dresses? The wearers, many of them with straight hair parted in the center and black platform shoes or Doc Marten boots, have produced a startling imagery that has gained in popularity as fashion leaders abandon summer clothes for the darker transitional colors that signal the post-Labor Day look. What's new with this year's all-black day look is the ground-skimming hem that represents a generation gap between older women who are holding out for short skirts because they feel long ones make them look older and younger women who are forging their own identities with the novelty of longer lengths. Two designers who have spearheaded this striking look are the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and the Belgian deconstructionist Martin Margiela. Whether it's with satiny one-piece black dresses or any combination of black sportswear, the effect is the same: an inky silhouette to the ground. What many wearers have created is a surface of multiple textures that gives the all-black look depth and character.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"POSTINGS: Andy Warhol's 'Factory'; The Foundation's Moving","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/realestate/postings-andy-warhol-s-factory-the-foundation-s-moving.html","abstract":"  It was Aug. 17, 1981, and Andy Warhol was in the real estate market.

Since it was signed by President George Bush on July 26, 1990, the law has been taking effect gradually in bus transportation, employment and training, public accommodation and telecommunications. The usual estimate given for the number of disabled in the United States is 43 million. The Office of Technology Assessment of Congress estimates that in 1990, 1.4 million people used wheelchairs, 1.7 million used walkers and 3 million one or more \"mobility technology devices,\" not counting canes and braces.  Lifts Called Crucial    The managers at the workshop represented the part of the travel industry that was given the longest time to comply with the law -- private-bus operators. The requirement considered the biggest burden by bus operators, that they buy only lift-equipped buses, does not take effect until 1996 and 1997.    While current rules require boarding assistance and storage of wheelchairs aboard the bus -- help that allows those with some mobility to take a bus trip -- most wheelchair-users consider lifts crucial. Lifts, they say, are essential to those with no mobility and they permit passengers to sit in their own chairs or scooters, and thus to travel autonomously. But few private bus companies are leaping ahead on this. The only nationwide intercity company, Greyhound, has no lift-equipped buses among the 1,850 in its active fleet. The American Bus Association says seven companies among its 600 members have lift-equipped long-distance buses.    Part of the reason for this inaction is that the laws do not go into effect for a long time, a delay that was allowed by Congress on the ground that private long-distance bus companies were in bad financial shape. \"Congress did not do you any favors,\" Mr. Isaacs told the bus managers, because final specifications for private companies' wheelchair-accessible long-distance buses have not yet been written. Mr. Isaacs, who has been in the transportation field for 16 years, and who was involved in the passage of the disabilities law, said that those who bought or refitted buses before seeing the regulations, which are due in draft form next year, might have bought something inadequate. He said, however, that an interim report already released by the Office of Technology Assessment probably could be read as a outline for the regulations.    Public transit systems were affected by the law immediately; as of August 1990, a month after the law was enacted, public systems could only buy or lease buses with anchors for wheelchairs and wheelchair boarding lifts, or devices at the bus stop for boarding wheelchairs. Since municipal buses usually remain in use for 12 years or so, the 1990 start of the law means that by 2002 all public buses will probably be lift-equipped. There were no retrofitting requirements in this law; an earlier law requiring retrofitting had been found unconstitutional. Some city systems, notably Denver's, were already putting lift-equipped long-distance buses into use when the disabilities law was enacted. New York City also started early making its buses lift-equipped, having been sued in 1979 by James J. Weisman of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. Mr. Weisman says that New York City Transit Authority buses are virtually 100 percent lift-equipped now.    New Jersey Transit, a public agency, has 1,921 buses and 514 of these are lift-equipped. None of its long-distance buses have lifts because none have been bought since 1987, said Armando Arrastia, a spokesman.    By contrast, private bus companies will not be required to buy or lease lift-equipped buses until 1996, if they are large companies, and until 1997 if they are small. What constitutes large companies and small companies will be specified in the law. Long-distance, or over-the-road buses, defined in the law as buses with an elevated passenger deck over the luggage compartment, do not need to be replaced for as many as 20 years, their owners say, meaning that United States intercity buses may not be all lift-equipped until 2017.  No One Is Suing    Enforcement of the disabilities law is done through lawsuits. For example, in the first 11 months that the employment sections of the act were in effect -- from July 1992 to June 1993 -- 11,760 complaints of employment discrimination were brought. The successful plantiffs won $11 million.   In sharp contrast, there have been no court complaints against private bus companies since the bus regulations began to come into effect, in 1991. This does not mean everything is satisfactory to advocates for the disabled. One reason they do not sue is that the delay in implementing the law provides narrow grounds.    Under the rules now in effect, bus companies must help people who have some mobility get onto the bus and must transport their wheelchairs; the rules also require that the deaf and blind, as well as others defined as disabled, be accommodated.    Mr. Isaacs also explained that while lawsuits brought under the new act can result in court injunctions, individual plaintiffs cannot collect for damages, as they can in employment cases. A bus company is required to pay penalties only if the suit is joined by the Department of Justice. Moreover, Mr. Isaacs said to his audience of bus company officials, \"I don't know anyone in a wheelchair who wants to undergo a trip with you to sue you.\"    The bus regulations, current and future, are complex because not only are they different for public and private companies, but they are also different for companies with schedules and those that provide service on request, and companies that are mainly involved in providing transportation and those that provide transportation as part of some other business, such as motels that pick up customers in vans at airports.   So far, 128 companies out of the 600 that belong to the American Bus Association have signed up for or have attended one of the 10 seminars nationwide. Mr. Isaacs believes attendance signifies interest, rather than a wish to learn how to evade the law. He said that the competitive marketplace might even push companies ahead of the law. Few Services Volunteered    But rare is the company owning a lift bus that is not required to do so. The participants in the seminar described meeting customers' needs by sending vans, or taking passengers by taxi to a bus station where a platform or a ramp is available.   Bill Kula, a spokesman for Greyhound, said that despite his company's lack of wheelchair-lift buses, \"We are in compliance.\" With 24 hours' notice, he said, his company \"can meet the vast majority of requests.\" Greyhound's \"helping hands\" policy, Mr. Kula said, allows a companion of a disabled person to travel free to provide help at stops.    Tauck Tours, a bus-tour operator in Westport, Conn., that owns no buses but leases them from other companies, has about 200 buses in use at a peak season, according to a spokesman, Phil Otterson. They all \"lean\" or \"kneel,\" but none has a lift. \"We are fulfilling our obligations by providing boarding assistance,\" he said.    The Peter Pan Bus Company of Springfield, Mass., one of the seven companies with lift buses, owns 175 long-distance buses, 9 of them lift-equipped, according to a vice president, Bob Schwarz. A Massachusetts subsidy plan helped the company buy them, Mr. Schwarz said.   Despite the paucity of companies like Peter Pan that have lift buses, Mr. Weisman of Eastern Paralyzed Veterans remains optimistic. \"People are beginning to realize that inaccessibility is stupid,\" he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"Why Chide Clinton or the Vineyard for His Vacationing There?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/opinion/l-why-chide-clinton-or-the-vineyard-for-his-vacationing-there-573393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Clinton Among the Swells\" (editorial, Aug. 22) is an unfortunate misrepresentation of Martha's Vineyard, as well as a mindless and snide attack on President Clinton.

Lined up on tiers amphitheater-style were rows of mannequins exquisitely decked out in haute couture dating mostly from the 1920's to the 1960's. \"The Art in Fashion: Modernity of Yesteryear\" was the theme of the exhibition and sale, which highlighted pivotal styles in the evolution of 20th-century fashion. Creations by some 43 designers included 23 flowing geometric constructions by Vionnet, 12 of Chanel's youthful outfits inspired by street clothes, and 20 by Givenchy, notably his 1950's bouffant blouses that revolutionized separates. Several of the more desirable pieces sold for more than $20,000 each.    In many ways, the annual Paris sale -- this was the third -- crystallizes a market that recognizes couture as fine art, not simply wearable fashion. The catalogue has established a new level of scholarship, including provenances, that will be difficult to ignore in the future. The preview was on a par with costume shows mounted by the Metropolitan Museum in New York or by the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan.

Surrounding us were hundreds of fish hanging on drying racks scattered through a thin grove of cottonwood trees. The filleted flesh lapped in waves along the fish spines and glowed in the sun with an erotic hue of orange-pink that could only be called salmon. The feel was leathery and plushy, like the footpad of an animal, and my fingertips came away glistening with oil. Through this ancient summer ritual of fish camp, the richness of salmon would help feed our host, Paul Stevens, his family, dogs and neighbors in the nearby Athabascan Indian town of Stevens Village through the frigid Alaskan winter. (Paul has since moved, for half the year, to the village of Venetie, north of Fort Yukon; his brother Willie will probably continue to work at the camp.)\n\nSeveral years ago the 70 or so people of Stevens Village, impelled by a 1971 law that made them (and most other Alaskan native villages) a for-profit corporation, opened Wood Yard camp, about 20 miles downstream from the village, to tourists, making it the only working native fish camp in Alaska accessible to outsiders. They bought a six-seat boat, replaced last year by a 49-seat aluminum motorboat, and invited travelers on the one road north from Fairbanks to stop briefly at the Yukon River bridge for a six-mile journey upriver to the camp. Tourists showed enough interest that the corporation expanded the options to include staying at the camp overnight.

She was born into a well-to-do Frankfurt mercantile family in 1821. One of her paternal aunts was the pianist Dorothea von Ertmann, an intimate of Beethoven (thought by some to have been his enigmatic \"immortal beloved\"), who for a time taught the young singer a Beethoven sonata every day, \"as my great master wanted it done.\" Mendelssohn and Liszt, Otto Nicolai and Pauline Viardot took an early interest in Graumann's singing, and some of them also became friends. She married an Italian baritone (of good birth, she carefully points out in her memoirs), Salvatore Marchesi de Castrone, and had some successes as a singer, mainly in concert.   But she quickly found her true calling: her principal teacher, the great Manuel Garcia Jr., was so impressed with Fraulein Graumann's understanding and industry that he confided beginning pupils to her and let her substitute for him when he was ill. By the end of the century, after holding posts in Vienna and Cologne, she was celebrated, honored and just a tad feared in Paris as the great Mme. Marchesi.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"A Writer Walks Into a Bar . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/books/a-writer-walks-into-a-bar.html","abstract":"WHOREDOM IN KIMMAGE\nIrish Women Coming of Age.\nBy Rosemary Mahoney.\n307 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. $21.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"The Disappearing $2,000 Book","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/books/the-disappearing-2000-book.html","abstract":"  ONCE upon a time storytellers perpetuated the tales of the tribe by memorizing them. With the invention of books, memory became less important: if you forgot something, you could look it up. Then came the computer; to access its electronic memory, all you had to remember was which key to press. Now this evolution has come full circle with a story-on-a-disk that destroys itself as you read it, leaving nothing but the memory of words glimpsed briefly on a computer screen.    The author of the self-sabotaging story is William Gibson, whose 1984 novel \"Neuromancer\" gave birth to the terms \"cyberpunk\" and \"cyberspace.\" Cyberpunk is science fiction with an attitude; it imagines a future in which people use the latest technology to do nasty things to one another. Mr. Gibson's characters, who spend the better part of their lives literally plugged into supercomputers, experience electronic data-flow as sensory input; they live in a \"consensual hallucination\" that Mr. Gibson has dubbed cyberspace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930829","headline":"Kendall L.

Bernstein, who would have been 75 last Wednesday, was the music world's most openly emotional, self-revealing, culturally omnivorous figure. Those qualities suffused his conducting and his own works, to say nothing of his books, his lectures and his television shows, particularly the \"Omnibus\" and \"Young People's Concerts\" that made him a kind of musical father figure for the generation that grew up in the 1960's.    So it was very much in the spirit of his expansive personality that the celebrations spilled out of the concert halls and into the streets and parks. And it was wholly in character that the main event -- an Alice Tully Hall concert on Wednesday, organized by the conductor's family -- was broadcast live in Japan and by tape delay in Germany, with an American showing scheduled for Sept. 9 at 9 P.M., on the Arts & Entertainment cable network.

The band, put together in Leeds, England, in 1977, started as a punk group, went through a country phase and now has come out a new- wave band, circa 1983. The music at first seemed indistinct, noisy rock that 100 bands could have played better. The attraction seemed obvious: at the Grand on Friday night, the Mekons put on a nostalgia show for the thirtysomething audience who had come to intellectual maturity listening to the group.   But after a while the group's elements started to separate themselves. The band is funny: after the show, the group's lead singer and guitarist, Jon Langford, let himself be carried by fans across the club, mocking rote rock-star moves. Onstage he and the band made no attempt to differentiate themselves from the audience, looking just like the average bohemians next door, and talking the same, too; Mr. Langford tossed off jokes about Marxism. And the band is literary without ever becoming proud of itself: one song conflated cliches with politically redolent fragments, mixing \"It was a dark and stormy night,\" with phrases like \"White House,\" \"Mississippi,\" and \"1964.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930830","headline":"Yankee Stadium Needs Satellite Parking Lot With a Shuttle Bus; The Train to the Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/30/opinion/l-yankee-stadium-needs-satellite-parking-lot-with-shuttle-bus-train-game-123293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Much of the discussion of whether or not to move the Yankees from the Bronx has focused on the assertion by the team owner, George Steinbrenner (and others), that parking and security for drivers and autos are inadequate at Yankee Stadium.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930830","headline":"Decision Is Near For Schools Chief","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/30/nyregion/decision-is-near-for-schools-chief.html","abstract":"  As the New York City Board of Education begins its final deliberations to choose a schools chancellor, two men have emerged as chief contenders.

Although Mr. Letterman began his new stint with obviously rekindled energy, the show's actual format was remarkably close to its predecessor's. Actionably close, as a matter of fact -- and of course Mr. Letterman made his legal skirmish with NBC one of the night's main sources of fun.   Striding onto the stage of a handsomely refurbished Ed Sullivan Theater, to an introduction wittily patched together from old Ed Sullivan clips (Mr. Letterman was variously \"a fabulous boy prodigy,\" \"my handsome Italian paisano\" and \"the most amazing of all the chimp acts ever to come on the show\"), CBS's new star wickedly took aim at his old employers. \"Legally, I can continue to call myself Dave,\" he explained, while also claiming to have found a peacock's head in his bed. Along came the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, obviously a man who enjoys living dangerously, to wish Mr. Letterman \"reasonably well\" and to confiscate a couple of cue cards, saying they were the intellectual property of NBC. Not surprisingly, Mr. Letterman found a lot to work with there, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930831","headline":"Koch Unbound; Musings on the Mayor's Race From a Not-So-Private Citizen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/31/nyregion/koch-unbound-musings-on-the-mayor-s-race-from-a-not-so-private-citizen.html","abstract":"  Sitting in a corner office on the 30th floor of a building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Edward Irving Koch, the master of the game, is watching the early skirmishes of the political melee that is the New York City mayoral race.

Not a bad sampling for one of this country's most important new-music festivals.   And if some musical styles were underrepresented -- the recent experimentation with vernacular forms, or samplings of new West Coast or Eastern European composition, for instance -- and if too many minor works were included, this was nevertheless an effective farewell for Oliver Knussen, the British composer who began directing the festival seven years ago.
