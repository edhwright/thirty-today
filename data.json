Granted, it offers drama and special-effects possibilities, and when Rossini composed \"Mose in Egitto,\" in 1818, it was a way around prohibitions against presenting secular theater works in Naples during Lent. Still, the story lacks a strong-willed female character at the center of the conflict, a considerable operatic deficiency.   Cecil B. DeMille faced the same problem in making \"The Ten Commandments,\" and so manufactured a romance between Moses and Pharaoh's wife. Rossini's solution was similar, but the composer and his librettist, Andrea Leone Tottola, put the romance at arms length. In the work's final (1827) version, the romance is between Moses's niece Anaide and Pharaoh's son Amenofi, both invented for this work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930524","headline":"Grounding Star Wars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/24/opinion/grounding-star-wars.html","abstract":"  Star Wars has finally been brought down to earth, where it belongs, 10 years and $32 billion after Ronald Reagan first dreamed up the space-based anti-missile shield.

Almost all changes under consideration include a central role for what used to be known as the family doctor -- today generally an internist or family practitioner -- who can save the system money by taking care of a wide variety of ailments on his own and referring patients for more costly specialty care or tests only when absolutely necessary.  Once a Cornerstone    Although such primary-care doctors were once the cornerstone of American medicine, their numbers have dwindled as younger doctors have been drawn to specialty fields by money and the lure of new technology.

Gurney may be the last playwright who writes full time about that quaint old bird, the New England WASP. Maybe it's an unfashionable calling, but Mr. Gurney's view of his terrain is so objective that his plays often fill in the missing pieces of the fractured American social puzzle. When you meet the economically rarefied yet often emotionally disadvantaged characters in Gurney plays like \"Love Letters\" and \"The Cocktail Hour,\" you remember just why the rest of the country has spent 25 or so years fleeing in the opposite direction.   Austin, the Boston banker at the center of \"Later Life,\" Mr. Gurney's enjoyable new 80-minute comedy at Playwrights Horizons, is one of the playwright's saddest creations. (Or half-creations. In the Playbill, Mr. Gurney acknowledges a debt to Henry James, whose tale \"The Beast in the Jungle\" seems the play's point of departure.) A smart and genial preppie in late middle age, Austin rather resembles the President he voted for in the last election. He's likable and polite, and he puts in his time at the office, but what exactly is he doing with his life? His children grown, his marriage ended by divorce, he is an empty suit longing to breathe free.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930524","headline":"Bear Stearns President Addresses St. John's U.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/24/nyregion/commencements-bear-stearns-president-addresses-st-john-s-u.html","abstract":"  James E.

On Tuesday at Avery Fisher Hall, \"Der Freischutz\" had the last of its opera-in-concert performances. Thursday the orchestra returned with the Beethoven Ninth Symphony. The concert will be repeated tomorrow night.   Very different pieces these, even though Weber's opera (finished in 1821) precedes the final version of the Ninth by only a year. \"Der Freischutz\" remains locked in its own time, in a world long past. But so eloquent is its spirit and imagination that it continues to refresh the receptive listener. The Beethoven, on the other hand, travels with more ease, attaching itself to every succeeding Zeitgeist. The symphony's half-mad extravagance, its bulldozing power and breathtaking ambition, its appeals to ecstasy: all offer a nigh-on indestructible common denominator for vast ranges of listeners. No matter what new world the Ninth may be cast into, it finds a home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930524","headline":"As Clinton's Problems Grow, So Do Hope and Unity of the Republican Party","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/24/us/as-clinton-s-problems-grow-so-do-hope-and-unity-of-the-republican-party.html","abstract":"  Bill Clinton's problems in the early months of his Presidency have done wonders for the morale and unity of the Republican Party, which emerged from the 1992 campaign not only defeated but also divided and perplexed about its future.

Young country wants to prove it's steeped in tradition while aiming for hits and jettisoning most of the tradition's subtleties. Often, it ends up picking up rock's leftovers and shifting country's heartfelt sentiment toward sentimentality.    Probably in emulation of the stadium-rock gimmicks of Garth Brooks, Mr. Tritt performed on a stage set fit for a heavy-metal video clip: shiny scaffolds holding platforms and banks of spotlights.

In the last 10 years, the Kurds have driven tens of thousands of Assyrians and Chaldeans into exile, and yet Western commentators persist in their naive belief that the Kurds are the only oppressed people in the region.   The Chaldeans and Assyrians, among the earliest converts to Christianity, have lived in the north of Iraq and southeast of Turkey for almost four millennia. They still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus.    At the beginning of the 1980's there were 25,000 Chaldean Christians living around Mardin in the predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey. Now there are only 200 or 300. Churches and monasteries in existence more than 1,000 years have been forced to close forever.   These people left because the Kurds told them they had no future in a land the Kurds would soon control. And with establishment of the so-called safe haven just across the border, the Chaldean and Assyrian Christians of northern Iraq have been driven to the same conclusion. Since the Persian Gulf war tens of thousands of them have fled, mostly to Turkey and Jordan.   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Ankara pretends these Christian peoples have nothing to fear from the Kurds (who massacred them along with Armenians early in this century), from Saddam Hussein or from the rising tide of Islam. Western countries support this line, despite the hundreds who have died trying to enter the European Community illegally.   The protection zone in northern Iraq may save the Kurds, but it does nothing to help the large numbers of Christians still living there. Northern Iraq -- like the rest of that unhappy country -- is composed of minorities: Kurds, Turkomans, Yezidis, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and they all need Western protection. Mr. Safire is absolutely right to demand that the West should do more than it is doing, but without linking this aid to safeguards for all these peoples, the West will simply be facilitating in Northern Iraq the ethnic cleansing it condemns in Bosnia.

It runs through a round of zonal tournaments all over the globe to the interzonals, from which candidates are selected for the elimination matches that eventually produce a championship challenger. And Judit Polgar, not yet 17 years old, is on the way. In fact, she is the first woman to make it to the interzonal stage, to be held this summer in Biel, Switzerland.   Polgar, who lives in Budapest with her two extraordinary, chess-playing sisters, Zsuzsa, 24, and Zsofia, 18, got through narrowly by achieving a tie for second place behind the Bulgarian grandmaster Kiril Georgiev in the Budapest zonal competition. Polgar then won a double-round elimination tie-break tournament in March in Budapest against the three players deadlocked with her.  TIE-BREAK STANDINGS Player . . . W. . . . L. . . . D. . . . Pts. Polgar . . . 3 . . . 1 . . . 2 . . . 4 Ftacnik . . . 2 . . . 2 . . . 2 . . . 3 Wojtkiewicz . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . 4 . . . 3 Gdanski . . . 0 . . . 2 . . . 4 . . . 2    The third qualifier for the interzonal was Lubomir Ftacnik of Slovakia, who played even with the Polish champion Alexander Wojtkiewicz in the tie-breaks but beat him out in their games against each other by a score of 1 1/2- 1/2.    Polgar incisively disposed of the Polish international master Jacek Gdanski's French Defense in Round 2 with a powerful mating attack.   There are not many openings as demanding as the Winawer Variation of the French Defense, initiated by 3 . . . Bb4. After 4 e5 Ne7 5 a3 Bc3 6 bc, White has the bishop-pair and a space advantage on the kingside as against his awkward doubled c pawns and Black's space advantage on the queenside.   The most direct, aggressive way to exploit this is 7 Qg4. Yet Black need not passively defend but can plan on a counterattack with 7 . . . Qc7. For example, after 8 Qg7 Rg8 9 Qh7 cd 10 Ne2 Nbc6 11 f4 Bd7, it is difficult to contain Black's dynamic possibilities. Polgar, of course, knows all this and has previously shown a preference for the gambit sideline with 8 Bd3 that she used here.   For a long time, it was thought that accepting the gambit with 8 . . . cd 9 Ne2 dc 10 Qg7 Rg8 11 Qh7 Qe5 12 Bf4 Qf6 13 h4 was unfavorable for Black, but in a Milu-D. Popescu game last year in Bucharest, Romania, Popescu boldly tried 13 . . . Rg2!?, with the idea that 14 Bg3 e5 15 Kf1 Rg3 16 Ng3 Bg4 would give him powerfully dynamic counterplay. Milu backed off with 14 Kf1, but after 14 . . . e5!? 15 Kg2 ef 16 Qh5 Nbc6 17 Qf3 Ng6 18 Bg6? Qg6 19 Kf1 Bg4! 20 Qc3, Black would have had the upper hand with 20 . . . Qe4 21 f3 Bf3 22 Re1 O-O-O 23 Ng1 Bg2 24 Kf2 Qg6. Gdanski avoided this, surely because he suspected that Polgar had come prepared with a new deadly wrinkle.   Still, his supposedly quiet method of closing the position with 8 . . . c4 9 Be2 O-O was not a permanent damper to White's aggressions. Polgar's 11 Bg5 Qa5 12 Kd2! left the black king pretty much cut off from its potential queenside defenders, while the white king was really secure, as Polgar would soon show.   Gdanski's 12 . . . f5 had the clever point that 13 ef?! e5! 14 Qh5 g6! 15 Qh6 Nf5 16 Qh3 16 Nfd4 turns the attack over to Black.   Gdanski must have felt safe in taking a defender away from his king with 14 . . . Nc8. He was right in thinking that he had a legitimate attack of his own but erred in underestimating how fast Polgar could strike.   Polgar halted Gdanski's attack with 18 Ra4! Qa4 and then charged with 19 h6! After 19 . . . g6 20 Bf6, Gdanski suddenly realized that she was about to crush 20 . . . Kg8 by 21 Qg6! hg 22 h7 Kf7 23 Ng5 Ke8 24 h8/Q Qa3 25 Qg7 Ne7 26 Rh8.   After 20 . . . Rf6 21 ef Kg8 22 Qc7!, defense by 22 . . . Rd8 would crack under 23 Ne5 Qa5 24 f7 Kf8 (24 . . . Kh8 permits 25 Qd6 followed by 26 f8/Q) 25 Nd7. Gdanski's 22 . . . Nb4 was desperation. After 23 cb Qb4 24 Kg3 g5 25 Ng5, there was no help in 25 . . . Qc3 26 Bd3!, so Gdanski gave up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930525","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/25/nyregion/c-corrections-791293.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Friday about the illumination of the old Smallpox Hospital on Roosevelt Island described the project incorrectly.

Some law enforcement officials theorized that the struggle in the Fuk Ching gang was rooted in its lucrative criminal specialty -- smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States from Fujian Province in southern China. Officials say the immigrants are often charged $30,000 to $35,000 by gang members and then forced to pay off that debt through legitimate work or by slipping into crime, including extortion and prostitution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930526","headline":"FLORIO AIDE LEAVES AMID BOND INQUIRY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/26/nyregion/florio-aide-leaves-amid-bond-inquiry.html","abstract":"  Joseph C.

In 1924, it became a silent film titled \"Greed,\" directed by Erich von Stroheim and ultimately cut from 10 hours to 2. In 1992, with William Bolcom as the composer, \"McTeague\" was turned into an opera. The world premiere at the Lyric Opera of Chicago was directed by Robert Altman, the longtime maverick film director, who also wrote the libretto with Arnold Weinstein.    Now, with Mr. Altman getting credit for the concept and creative supervision, there's \"The Real McTeague,\" an hourlong \"Great Performances\" presentation on Channel 13 at 9 tonight. In a kind of synthesis of forms, scenes from the von Stroheim film are blended with corresponding scenes from the opera, directed for television by Kirk Browning. The whole is woven together with excerpts from the novel, read by Studs Terkel with his customary feistiness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930526","headline":"Manufacturers Recycling Half of Chemical Wastes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/26/us/manufacturers-recycling-half-of-chemical-wastes.html","abstract":"  The nation's manufacturers recycled more than half of the 38 billion pounds of chemical wastes they produced in 1991, as the amount of such waste released into the environment continued to decline, the Environmental Protection Agency reported today.
