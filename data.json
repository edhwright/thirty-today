Soon thereafter, Mr. Lee was shot and killed by a white segregationist state legislator with whom he had grown up.

Brandeis High School in Manhattan, Alfred Cruz punches his student identification card into the machine just inside the front entrance. He steps onto a metal scanner and if the red light blinks on, he has to empty his pockets. He shoves his book bag through the X-ray machine, then he raises his arms so a security officer can wave a portable metal detector over his body like a wand.   Alfred says he no longer minds the mechanized routine of going to school, but educators point to the metal detector as a vivid emblem of the failures of the large urban high school. Overcrowded and impersonal, with a threat of violence, schools like Brandeis contribute to a staggering truancy rate, particularly among black and Hispanic boys, academic experts and educators say.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"Allied Soldiers March to Say Farewell to Berlin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/world/allied-soldiers-march-to-say-farewell-to-berlin.html","abstract":"  Soldiers from the United States, Britain and France marched through Berlin today in a military farewell to the city their armies entered as victors and then guarded for nearly half a century.

As a result it becomes necessary to change money daily. Another consequence is that many stores, hotels and restaurants do not accept credit cards. And if they do, they charge a premium of over 40 percent. This makes it necessary to deal in large amounts of cash.   A final difficulty is that not all banks will even change traveler's checks.

Watering places, in particular, seem to establish a tempo that becomes immediately congenial: an adagio that goes with emptying cups of more or less palatable liquid, window-shopping (Gucci, Cartier et al. have local outlets), newspaper-scanning (foreign papers at the kiosk halfway down Viale Verdi), and an occasional anodyne card game, never for money (loss would be bad for the heart as well as the temper), but for fun, to pass the seemingly endless, undemanding time.\n\nAt Montecatini in central Tuscany, one of Italy's most famous and most popular spas, the visitor easily falls into the relaxed rhythm of the city's life. Unlike almost every other Italian town, here no obligatory sights require your attention: no museums crammed with unparalleled masterpieces, no grand churches or frescoed palaces. If you can't live without high culture, you can, of course, find plenty within easy reach (the local travel agencies offer daily afternoon excursions to nearby Pisa or Lucca or to Florence, an hour away). But you are more likely to succumb to the temptation of letting Montecatini's easy, not to say lazy pace, carry you serenely along. With a population of over 20,000, the town has a life beyond the thermal establishments. If you walk along the busy Corso Roma, you find yourself in a normal small Tuscan city, with shops and, on the side streets, quiet blocks of apartments and small villas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"Fredric L.

Not represented in the almanac was the more politically active contingent of Berlin Dada, including George Grosz, John Heartfield and Wieland Herzfelde, an omission that points to the fractures in the ever-volatile movement that was born of the disgust of European artists and intellectuals with the carnage produced by the nationalist fever of World War I. This annotated edition of the almanac, the first to appear in English, includes an introduction in the form of a survey of the history of Dada by the editor and translator Malcolm Green, capsule biographies of Dada figures, and supplementary documents and photographs. This is a somewhat rough and ready edition with an agitprop quality, but it is nevertheless a crucial document for anyone interested in the history of the 20th-century avant-garde.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"Protecting an 8,400-Mile Legacy of Waterways","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/nyregion/protecting-an-8400mile-legacy-of-waterways.html","abstract":"ASK Connecticut residents to name the state's rivers and most will mention the Connecticut, the Housatonic and the Farmington.

Mongolian barbecue differs only in how it is cooked, and that process has had an interesting evolution from the time the Mongols ruled China. The chewy beef and lamb of those days were boiled whole, and each guest carved out a portion with his dagger in what must have been a very hands-on operation. Eventually, the more economical and energy-saving idea of cutting before cooking came into general practice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"PRO BAsKETBALL; The Prognosis for Little Bobby Hurley: Back to Normal, Slowly but Surely","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/sports/pro-basketball-prognosis-for-little-bobby-hurley-back-normal-slowly-but-surely.html","abstract":"  In white T-shirt, blue jeans, a black cap and with a black equipment bag slung over his shoulder, he came into the locker room at St. Rose's High here on the Jersey Shore on Friday night looking like one of the school's freshmen.

With the institution struggling to get back on its feet last year after floundering economically, a group of volunteers decided to try to turn the complex around as well as to restore the vessel, the Two Brothers.   \"We always knew the boat was there,\" a volunteer, Norman Lacourciere of Bohemia, said. \"Nothing was ever done about it. So we dragged it out.\"   Leading the nine-member rebuilding crew is Doc McKnight of Holbrook, a cabinetmaker. He joined the volunteers in October, when he \"saw they were in trouble,\" he said.   Since Suffolk County bought the 26 acres of a former estate on Great South Bay in 1966 the museum has showcased crafts, shipwreck artifacts and maritime activities. After the county brought the former Anson Wales Hard estate, the museum, which the county and donation had financed purchased historic buildings and small seagoing boats. Old Salts and Schoolchildren    Over the years baymen met to talk over old times and help restore boats, volunteers turned out to care for the vintage vessels, and schoolchildren visited on field trips.   In 1991 the county stopped paying $40,000 of the $87,480 it paid toward salaries and operating expenses. By March 1993 the county had removed its full amount of financing.   The chairman of the board, Stanley Feldman, said the 20-member board, with several new members, was trying to reinvigorate the museum. Last year the museum began to try to broaden its fund-raising base, and it changed its name and focus. The Suffolk Marine Museum had concentrated on the Dutch settlers and the early life along Great South Bay that centered on Oyster and clamming. The board changed the name to the Long Island Maritime Museum.   Volunteers like Ron Swedborg of Oakdale, who teaches wood carving and will soon run the new blacksmith shop at the museum, have returned. \"The volunteer program hit its peak in the mid-80's,\" Mr. Swedborg said. \"But it went down when the funding went down, and the boats didn't go out. But this year the people have come back. And there's a lot of new people, as well as the regulars from all over Long Island.\"   \"The people who want it to work are working their head off,\" said Elizabeth Whitehouse, a trustee and a retired teacher from Sayville who runs the education program. That program attracted more than 2,000 schoolchildren last year, and the museum had a total of 10,000 visitors.   The museum is sponsoring the Long Island Antique Classic Boat Show on Saturday, a nautical fair and seafood festival on Aug. 27 and 28 and an old-timer's regatta in September.   But a trustee, Alfred Terry Jr. of Bayport, voiced skepticism. \"I doubt whether they can raise the money,\" Mr. Terry said. \"Maritime museums are just not out there. They should tell the state and county to pick up the tab.\"   In January the board also vetoed a $2.5 million proposal by the Village of Patchogue to buy and relocate the outbuildings and boats to a two-and-a-half-acre federally owned site along the Patchogue River. Last year the museum dismissed three top employees, including the director, curator and librarian. To Run 'Like a Business'   \"No one was accredited before to handle the fund raising and grant writing,\" Mr. Feldman said. \"Now we are going to run the museum like a business.\"   The operating budget is $165,000, including salaries for an executive director and a curator. Volunteers have donated 10,000 hours this year, Mr. Feldman added.   More than 20 grant requests, written by board members who are former educators, have been sent to governmental and private agencies.   County Legislator Steve Levy, Democrat of Sayville, has proposed that the county spend someof its income from the 0.75 percent hotel tax on the museum. Mr. Levy has also asked a company about providing ferry to dock at the museum, he said.   Another focus for the revitalization is membership, and 636 members have joined. Their dues totals $25,000. The board is looking inviting to other maritime groups to use the museum for their social events. \"We're trying to make friends,\" the treasurer, Gary Herold of Bellport, said.   A walk around the museum usually begins at the 100-year-old Baymans' Cottage, a neat grey structure with green shutters on a rise overlooking the bay. Inside, the tiny rooms include all the amenities that made life comfortable for the bayman, appearing as if the family had just stepped out for a moment. Next is the small craft building, housing more than 50 historic boats. Flat duck boats and pleasure boats, some created by a well-known designer from Patchogue, Gil Smith, rest on racks in various stages of renovation or decay.   Across the field is the 19th-century boat shop. Mr. Terry, an expert in rebuilding Smith boats, said he remembered when the boathouse was moved from its site in Center Moriches down the river to the bay across the water and west to the museum.   Today the smell of wood shavings permeates the largest room of the building. It is a working shop, and a boat in progress rests on a cradle with tools nearby. Upstairs three ancient Singer sewing machines sit ready for work.   Next door is the oyster-processing house, set up for shucking and processing. At its wraparound dock are moored the boats used in clamming and oyster in the late 1800's, the Priscilla, a two-masted schooner, and Modesty, a sloop, both of which participated in Op Sail 1986 and 1992. Also docked, but not in working order, are a little tugboat, the Charlotte, and the newly acquired Vixen, once a sailboat and now a powerboat.   Mr. McKinght said the crew working on the Two Brothers, which Neil Isbrandtsen Risig of Brightwaters donated in 1976, was aiming for a dedication ceremony next month.   \"Now we'll be able to demonstrate square riggers to the youngsters,\" said Mr. McKnight, who also teaches the scrimshaw class.   The museum, on West Avenue off Montauk Highway, is open yearround. Its telephone number if 854-4974.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"Monte Isola Casts a Net Of Romance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/travel/monte-isola-casts-a-net-of-romance.html","abstract":"THOUGH a thoroughly seasoned traveler by the time she saw Lago d'Iseo in 1746, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was instantly captivated, writing posthaste to her daughter back in England: \"I am now in a place the most beautifully romantic I ever saw in my life.\" Indeed, she liked it so much that, having gone there for a brief rest cure, she settled on the lake's shores for over a decade.

He makes the silly point that \"physics is history\" because it would take an accelerator \"one light-year in radius\" to test the \"theory of everything.\" But negativists like him miss two key points.   First, almost all the great advances in physics were made indirectly, not directly. In 1825, negativists like Auguste Comte flatly declared that science will never know one thing: the composition of the stars. This was a reasonable statement, since another silly calculation would have shown it would bankrupt the planet earth to send a probe to the nearest star.

A simulation of a Russian coffeehouse will open at 7 P.M., serving fresh-baked delicacies made by immigrants resettled by the Jewish Family Service of North Jersey. The affair will be at the Y.M./Y.W.H.A., 1 Park Drive. The refreshments are included in the admission, which is $5.    Information: (201) 595-0555. 'FOLK 'N ROLL'    Country, folk, swing, gospel, ballad and rock will be the musical mix when Dave Sherman, John Siehl, Joe Surowiec and Dan Mulvay -- New Jersey musicians every one -- combine their talents for a guitar-picking, piano-fingering \"folk 'n roll\" performance opening the summer Clearwater Coffee House Series on Saturday at Fort Hancock in Sandy Hook.   The series, a joint venture of the Monmouth County Friends of Clearwater, which is dedicated to environmental education and action, and the National Park Service, will continue on Saturdays for three months: on July 9, Aug. 13 and Sept. 17. Admission is $5 for each concert at 8:15 P.M. in the chapel of the fort at Sandy Hook.   Information: (908) 872-9644. 'JAZZ IN BLOOM'    \"Jazz in Bloom,\" a concert in the garden at the Newark Museum early Thursday evening, will star Houston Person and Etta Jones, raise money to help finance a series of seven free lunchtime concerts in the garden and feature sample fare from a variety of the city's restaurants.   Portuguese, Korean, Spanish, Cuban and \"down home\"-style North American cuisine at a minimal charge, free soft drinks and a cash bar will all be part of the event in the Alice Ransom Dreyfuss Memorial Garden at the museum, 49 Washington Street, from 5 to 7:30 P.M. If it rains, the concert will be in the Engelhard Court. Admission is $12.   Information: (201) 596-6550. FLORAL WATERCOLORS    The West Orange Public Library has decorated its wall for the month of June with about a dozen 24-inch-by- 30-inch floral watercolors by Karen Schauben of Livingston.   Two 32-inch-by-40-inch prints in her painterly and intense style are also on display. The deep colors in her work are striking in contrast to the hues usually seen in watercolors.   The library, 46 Mount Pleasant Avenue, opens at 9 A.M. Monday through Saturday and closes at 9 P.M. except on Tuesday and Friday (5:30 P.M.) and on Saturday (5 P.M.). Sunday hours are 1 to 5 P.M.   Information: (201) 736-0198. MARY L. EMBLEN STAGE PORTRAYALS     For the last 14 years, Richard Hoehler has been writing short fiction based on his dead-end travels from blue-collar job to blue-collar job in New Jersey. The pieces have been published in newspapers and collections, including \"Middle Jersey Writers Anthology.\"   His recollections of, among others, house painting, school bus driving and bartending led to a stage adaptation, \"New Jersey/New York,\" that was presented off Off Broadway last year, with Mr. Hoehler himself in a cast of six.    In \"Out of the Blue,\" Mr. Hoehler, 40, who grew up in Carteret, has created eight New Jersey characters expressly for the stage. They include an immigrant fruit juice vendor and an instructor of English as a second language. And he is playing them all.    \"Richard is looking back at his working-class life -- his father was a truck driver; his mother is a secretary -- not in anger, but with affection,\" said Jonathan Slaff, a spokesman for the new play. \"He has no social or political agenda. And it's easy to see yourself in his characters. Working-class people don't necessarily have muddy boots on; they're now indoors, wearing headsets or aprons.\"   Performances of \"Out of the Blue\" take place today and next Sunday at 3 P.M. and Thursday through Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Joyce and Seward Johnson Theater at the Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue (at East 10th Street) in Manhattan. Tickets are $10.   Information: (212) 254-1109.

Now she's an embarrassment that people don't talk about, like an aunt who went crazy.    Perhaps the biggest insult to her memory is the collective amnesia on the part of gay people when it comes to her role in the Stonewall riots. They began on the night of her funeral, when a group of bar patrons, their emotions heightened by her dramatic last rites (more than 20,000 fans filed past her coffin at Campbell's Funeral Home in Manhattan), fought back during a then all-too-common police raid. Gay liberation had been simmering for years, of course, but she was the spark that lighted its flame, its Boston Tea Party, so to speak.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"Jennifer E.

But summer in the city offers its own special joys and pains. So, although there are many things that most people know about surviving the summer, here are a few creative and practical tips and tidbits to tuck away for the sultry season. \n\n PITY the dog or cat left in a New York apartment with no air conditioning. Here's help for keeping them cool. The A.S.P.C.A. suggests freezing a bowl of water overnight and leaving it out for the pet to lick all day. Also, keep drapes drawn and place a fan where the pet can't knock it over or chew on the wire.\nBEING A COOL CONSUMER \n\n NOT everyone can afford even a low-priced, new air-conditioner. But before you buy a used one, Jim Nanni, a spokesman for Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, suggests some simple checks. Listen to it; weird sounds spell trouble. Check visible coils for corrosion, dirt or damage. Look for the manufacturer's label (sometimes inside the front plastic cover) for a manufacturing date and power capabilities. Use a thermometer to check the air-flow temperature; adding freon can be expensive. And a professional once-over is a good idea.\nTHE THRILL OF GRILLING \n\n WITHOUT a backyard, barbecuing in the city can be tricky. Tar roofs and open barbecue flames do not mix, says Firefighter Francis J. McCabe, a Fire Department spokesman. Terrace barbecuing should be done at least 10 feet from the entrance to a room. Keep a fire extinguisher handy. Using hibachis inside apartments is not wise, he says, because the flame is not as controllable as that on a gas stove. As for wide-open spaces, forget Central Park. The city parks that do allow barbecuing are: Fort Washington Park and Randall's Island in Manhattan; Alley Pond Park, Cunningham Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Forest Park and Rockaway Beach in Queens; Prospect Park and Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn; Crotona Park, the Alan Shandler Recreation Area of Van Cortlandt Park, and sections of Orchard Beach, which is the southern section of Pelham Bay Park, in the Bronx, and Clove Lakes and Willow Brook Park on Staten Island.\nEYE-SAVING DEVICES \n\n SUNGLASSES alert: \"Darker sunglasses can actually be harmful, because the pupil is fooled into dilating by the dim light, and this allows U.V. rays to enter freely,\" warns Dr. Jack Jeffers, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Radiation from those rays, as everyone has often been warned, can cause melanomas (of the skin and eye), heighten cataract development and increase chances of vision loss with age. Dr. Jeffers suggests having ultraviolet protection built into clear eyeglass lenses and to buy only those dark sunglasses that are labeled as offering 99 to 100 percent protection. \nGETTING THE STAR TREATMENT \n\n ADMIT it. Tourists aren't the only ones who yearn to see the inside of some of the city's toniest restaurants. So for John and Jane Q. Citizen who have considered haute cuisine when takeout Chinese was not enough, a few guidelines. Balmy Friday nights can be a great time to try dining at a celebrity-hot place. \"If it's nice out,\" says Bill Gilroy, owner of Match in SoHo, the trendsetters \"leave town and forget to cancel.\" If it rains, though, forget it. To avoid summer tourists at hot spots, consider an early dinner. European tourists, especially, tend to eat later. Best time: 7:30 P.M. The best day to recline at a power-lunch table in summer? \"Monday,\" says Sirio Maccione, owner of Le Cirque, on the East Side. \"Many customers who go away for weekends stay until Monday.\"\nOUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR \n\n FOR anyone who imagines that those trips to the refrigerator for something cold will also help cool off the kitchen, a warning: \"Each time the door opens, the motor has to generate a termendous amount of energy, which actually heats up your kitchen,\" says Jim Samuels, a spokesman for Sears. And anyway, it is hot drinks, like tea, that actually help make the drinker feel cooler, says Sabine Cassel, a New York-based food writer. For sunburn sufferers, the refrigerator can be a summer medicine cabinet. \"Take a bath with two quarts of milk or with orange sections, apply compresses of vinegar on your face and body, and try facial masks of sour cream and mashed strawberries or egg white,\" advises Lia Schorr, a local skin-care salon owner and author. \"Plain yogurt,\" advises Dorit Baxter, another skin-care salon owner.\nBUGS, BITES AND STUFF \n\n SOME good news about Lyme disease. \"The Department of Health annually conducts surveys of tick-breeding areas, and we have never found a Lyme-infected tick in New York,\" says Steven Matthews, spokesman for the department. Also, in the bug vein, there is now a trend toward natural bug-repellent products. Aveda, for instance, offers a body spray and patio candle called Attracts People Not Insects. For a homemade bug-bite treatment: Try compresses of equal parts skim milk and ice water, suggests Dr. Patricia Wexler, a New York dermatologist. \nDIVERSION: See and Spray\n\n One toy already is beginning to look like a candidate for the summer's most-wanted list. Shout 'N' Shoot is a battery-operated, voce-activated water gun that is worn on the head and shoots water when the wearer speaks into an attached microphone. Some local toy stores say they are already sold out. Distributed by CAP Toys, of Bedford Heights, Ohio, Shoot 'N' Shout sells for an average retail price of $19.99. The company says it has sold close to a million just a few months.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"A Bambi For the 90's, Via Shakespeare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/movies/film-view-a-bambi-for-the-90-s-via-shakespeare.html","abstract":"  LAST SUMMER, PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT whether the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" were too frightening for children. This summer, some may look at \"The Lion King\" and wonder if the death of the father lion is too traumatic. In the first case, the worry was that brilliant special effects would leave children frightened of animals they know do not really walk the earth; in the second, that a well-told story would have children identifying with an animated lion cub and his grief and guilt over the loss of his father.   In \"The Lion King,\" which opened on Wednesday, Mufasa, the king of beasts, is trampled in a wildebeest stampede as he saves his little cub, Simba. Mufasa's evil brother, Scar, who provoked the stampede to kill his brother and take over the lion kingdom, convinces Simba that he killed his father. The distraught cub leaves home, nearly dies and wanders the veldt until he grows up enough to return and challenge his usurping uncle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940619","headline":"Looking Forward To Mondays","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/style/looking-forward-to-mondays.html","abstract":"  Cross \"The Cotton Club\" with \"Saturday Night Fever,\" add a dash of \"Star Wars\" (remember the interplanetary saloon?) and you'll have an idea of the scene that unfolds every Monday night at the China Club, the venerable dance palace and rock club at 75th Street and Broadway.

The T-shirts allow for modesty and make the dresses wearable, allowing women to wear a bra without the straps showing. The slip dresses being worn around town are both long and short.

[ \"Nuclear Critic and Flaws in Study,\" Letters, May 8 ] . He pretends that the laboratory is located at its Upton postal address, but in reality, B.N.L., designated by E.P.A. as a Superfund waste site, takes up five square miles in central Suffolk.    He ignores the point we made that the highest single breast-cancer rate in Long Island was reported by the State Tumor Registry for the community group Brookhaven-Bellport, which is located south of B.N.L., in accordance with \"Brookhaven Reactor Fire Raises Questions on Nuclear Hazards\"  [ April 10 ] , referring to previous reports of radioactive contamination of B.N.L. ground water's flowing south. The 200,000 women living within 15 miles of the B.N.L. reactor were reported to have rates 11 percent above the county average.   As the co-author with Dr. E. J. Sternglass of an article soon to be published by the Long Island University School of Public Service exploring the reasons for this epidemiological anomaly, I can state as a professional statistician that the probability that the elevated rates in central Suffolk could be due to chance is less than one in 10,000. So there must be some casual environmental factor.   Brookhaven can not forgive Dr. Sternglass for publishing an article in 1972 pointing out that recorded B.N.L.  airborne and liquid emissions from 1950 to 1966 were equivalent to exposure to atmospheric fallout in those years and could be associated with anomalous increases in Long Island infant mortality in the 1960's.   Our hypothesis that the current high breast-cancer rates in central Suffolk may be a later manifestation of the same radioactive contamination is supported by another article of ours, in the October 1993 issue of The International Journal of Health Services, published by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, which examines the role of fission products in the diet in the current epidemic rise of breast cancer in Long Island, Connecticut and Westchester County.

J. Simpson remains in custody, charged with murdering his former wife and one of her friends. His defense remains the same: He did not do it. The authorities in Los Angeles remain in sole possession of the evidence, so it is difficult to assess his veracity. But despite all the uncertainties, lawyers following the case generally agree on several suppositions about how the Simpson case may develop.   Most important, they said that because Mr. Simpson seemed to remain a beloved figure to many people, despite standing accused of two brutal murders, despite fleeing from the authorities, a jury could well treat him more leniently than it would the average criminal defendant. - A jury, these lawyers said, could well grasp at potential defense arguments that Mr. Simpson was mentally unstable or in a jealous rage, not just to spare Mr. Simpson's life but to convict him of a lesser charge, like manslaughter, or even to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. For anyone who could be cheered as if charging toward the end zone as the police pursued him across the freeways of Los Angeles on Friday, popularity may be the ultimate defense.   These lawyers say that notwithstanding Mr. Simpson's status as an icon, they expect the Los Angeles District Attorney, already burdened by a series of embarrassing losses in other highly publicized cases and charges of preferential treatment here, to seek the death penalty in the case. But they are just as sure Mr. Simpson, a football star and hero to millions, remains too beloved for any jury to send to the gas chamber.

Rod Pfister of Washington had a 5-meter lead on Hines going over the last hurdle but Pfister tripped and fell over the barrier and Hines went past him for the victory. McMullen also anchored the Jeuness T.C. of Brooklyn to victory in the 1,600-meter relay. She ran a 54.2 400-split as the team won in 3:44.13.

Both times are national bests this year and were meet records.

The action, a disarmingly simple policy change, owes much to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's criminal justice office and his conspicuous search for places to streamline the city budget.

Originally recorded in 1975, this album is a paradigm for experimental Afro-Hispanic music that's being carried on to this day. The performers, Grupo Folklorico y Experimental Nuevayorquino, included Andy and Jerry Gonzalez, the great trumpeter Chocolate Armenteros, Milton Cardona and many others; they successfully surveyed both older, more folkloric styles of Cuban and Puerto Rican music (innovative in itself), but also brought it all up to date. It's also an album that could only be made in New York, where all this music could be mulled over and reconstructed without the chauvinism that often plagues regional music. And it jumps out with its power. The album gives up a lot of space to improvisation, and it rocks with riffs. Unfortunately, there are virtually no liner notes, and the original two-volume classic album, when transferred to CD, is now missing two tracks.
