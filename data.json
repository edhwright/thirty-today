He repeatedly tried to escape the confines of his Milanese milieu, adapting the innovations of his more radical contemporaries. The man who journeyed far to see Strauss's \"Salome\" and Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire\" was seeking ways to bring Italian opera into the 20th century.   Tradition, however, held fast; audiences preferred the previous century. Thus the initial failure of \"Madama Butterfly,\" which Puccini intended as a departure from standard melodrama. After a savage reception from a La Scala crowd in 1904, the composer quickly concocted substitute versions of his \"Japanese Tragedy,\" softening the central conflict of American and Japanese culture. The final 1906 version has since become universally beloved, despite makeshift plotting in the third act.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930802","headline":"1893: Argentine Crisis : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/02/opinion/IHT-1893-argentine-crisis-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - South America cannot get rid of its crises and its revolutions.

Festival New Orleans, which ended a six-week tour with a show at Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh, L.I., on Sunday evening, picked up the main elements of its parent festival: music, food and crafts. When the best musicians were onstage, the six-hour show went a long way toward exporting the Big Easy; call it Nolapalooza.   But there was a snag. Like a Broadway road show, Festival New Orleans depended largely on second-string performers. Only Buckwheat Zydeco, a clattering, steaming, chugging accordion-driven blues-rock band, and Beausoleil, a fiddle-topped Acadian (Cajun) rock band, are at the top of their genres. Most of the other performers had some New Orleans rhythm but not first-rate songs. Still, Festival New Orleans provided nearly nonstop syncopation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930803","headline":"What Will Protect Us From Managed Care?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/03/opinion/l-what-will-protect-us-from-managed-care-957593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans to limit the choice of doctors and hospitals for its oldest and sickest patients\" you report July 20.

The Germans again dominated in diving, winning a fourth gold medal in a row, and Hungary's triple Olympic medalist, Krisztina Egerszegi, coasted to victory in the women's 400-meter individual medley. Guttler, a Hungarian, became the first swimmer to break the 61-second barrier in the 100-meter breast-stroke when he set a world record in a heat before winning the gold. During the first day of racing in the Ponds Forge pool, Guttler clocked 1 minute 00.95 seconds in the final heat. In the final, Guttler went off to a fast first 50 meters and seemed on his way to breaking the record again. He managed 1:01.04, while Nick Gillingham of Britain came in second with 1:02.02. Van Almsick, who won two silver and two bronze medals for Germany at last year's Olympics at age 14, won the 100 meters in European record time, then went on to another gold in the 800-meters freestyle relay.
