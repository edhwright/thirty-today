The first composer, Katrina Krimsky, presented standard post-hippie compositional ideas -- a little Indian music, a little jazz, a bit of violin -- and kept the normal concert etiquette, asking the audience to sit still and listen. The second, LaMonte Young, brought a minor sort of ideological framework to his piece. By situating his musicians around the hall, Mr. Young asked the audience to participate in a non-traditional way. In fact, everybody just sat there and listened. Given the general revolution in the relationship between audience and performer wrought by African-American and popular American music, the whole thing seemed more than a bit innocent.   Mr. Young's piece, \"The Melodic Version of the Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer,\" part of a longer composition called \"The Four Dreams of China,\" had more to do with the translation of technique into experience than with any sort of musical creativity. Mr. Young has long been interested in the sound of transformers buzzing, and he had his eight trumpeters use mutes to create hums and buzzes. Playing with slight pitch variations, the trumpeters moved from consonance to dissonance; with passive long notes, the musicians allowed the frequencies of the notes to mesh and then jumble up, making clear the subtle interplay of intonations.

The Mayor is apparently courting the support of owners of small and medium-sized businesses, which make up most of the city's business community.

Ms. Voigt, a young American soprano, has already achieved acclaim in a variety of roles, including her Ariadne at the Boston Lyric Opera two seasons ago.   Vocally, Ms. Voigt did not disappoint. With an instrument seemingly made for the vast scale of the Met, she poured out rich, lustrous, nuanced tone with ease and security. Dramatically, however, she seemed stiff and uncommunicative, even more ill at ease than might reasonably be expected in Elijah Moshinsky's elephantine new production of the opera. But with voices of such grandeur in short supply, Ms. Voigt will not lack opportunity to work on her stage presence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930414","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/14/nyregion/bridge-284093.html","abstract":"  It is generally understood that a duplicate player must strive for overtricks, even perhaps jeopardizing a contract to do so.

During a civil war that began with Angola's independence in 1975, Mr. Savimbi insisted that his Unita rebels were democrats thirsting for a chance at the polls to unseat a leftist Government in Luanda. He got his wish last September, but his rival, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, won by a plurality in a generally fair first-round vote that was to be followed by a runoff. But instead of contesting the runoff, Mr. Savimbi resumed fighting, ferociously.    He has been able to do this, as The Times's Kenneth Noble reports, because Unita cheated on cease-fire terms by pretending to demobilize. Western analysts estimate that Mr. Savimbi kept a force of 30,000 to 35,000 soldiers, while the Luanda Government, with three times that number under arms, complied by downsizing its army to 10,000. Unita's successes spring from treachery, not valor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930414","headline":"What You Reveal To a Psychotherapist May Go Further","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/14/health/what-you-reveal-to-a-psychotherapist-may-go-further.html","abstract":"  MILLIONS of people in recent weeks have heard of psychotherapists testifying in court about intimate emotional details told to them by Woody Allen, Mia Farrow and their children, or by Sol Wachtler, the former Chief Judge of New York State.

The first step must be for both sides to avoid the traditional omiyage, or gift, of a Japanese stimulus package. For nearly 50 years, Japanese prime ministers have come to Washington bearing gifts that usually have been promises to stimulate their own economy. \n\nIn theory, stimulating Japan's economy is supposed to increase imports and reduce the trade imbalance. In fact, a succession of similar proposals over the last decade has not solved the trade problem. Japan's demand for foreign goods is so unchanging that even a huge stimulus has yielded only a small increase in imports. If past trends hold, Mr. Clinton's proposed $19.5 billion package to stimulate our own economy, which has run into a Congressional roadblock, would create more U.S. imports of Japanese goods than Mr. Miyazawa's $100 billion program would yield in Japanese imports of U.S. goods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930415","headline":"Wilander Comeback","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/15/sports/sports-people-tennis-wilander-comeback.html","abstract":"  Following in the footsteps of BJORN BORG, a fellow Swede, MATS WILANDER, is attempting a comeback.

None of the players can play in the world championships without the consent of the organization, according to Smith, and they face possible suspensions from the team if they do not report to Binghamton when told.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930415","headline":"A Jazz-Singing Legend Guides a New Generation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/15/arts/a-jazz-singing-legend-guides-a-new-generation.html","abstract":"  By the time Betty Carter started singing professionally, with Lionel Hampton's orchestra in 1948, she had made a decision to be different. Unlike most other singers of her generation, she didn't want to sound like Dinah Washington or Ella Fitzgerald or Sarah Vaughan.    Instead, she dedicated herself to finding her own voice. And now, 45 years later, the astringent tone she has developed and the emotionally intense tempos she favors have made her jazz's most imposing singer. She is at ease with being different: it seems almost a necessity to her, a way of marking off some esthetic and personal territory and staking a claim for greatness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930415","headline":"Kukoc Is Poised For the Grand Finale in Europe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/15/sports/IHT-kukoc-is-poised-for-the-grand-finale-in-europe.html","abstract":"Awaiting Toni Kukoc were his opponents from PAOK Saloniki, who weren't going to let him get off a shot in the final 10, evaporating seconds.

Mearsheimer's proposals to bring an end to the war in the former Yugoslavia, covers three points: (1) The world should accept ethnic homogeneity as a principle for state building in the Balkans, and should sponsor forced movements of ethnic groups on a vast scale to create ethnically homogeneous states. (2) This principle should \"address problems across the Balkans,\" including at least Croatia and Kosovo. (3) The United States and its allies should threaten force by sending weapons \"to the Bosnian Muslims, the Croatians and perhaps the Albanians,\" confronting Serbia with a multifront war.   There is a grave problem with touting ethnic homogeneity as a basis of legitimacy in the Balkans: how do we keep the idea of ethnic homogeneity out of places where we don't want it (like the United States)? Once ethnic homogeneity is accepted as a principle, it provides the catalyst for many dormant ethnic problems to become active and violent. Ethnic Albanians are 90 percent of the population in Kosovo, and they live under the control of the 10 percent who are ethnic Serbs. They have not taken the road of a violent \"solution.\" Urging them to turn to violence hardly seems in anyone's real interest -- certainly not that of the United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"Bosnia Yielding Town to Serbs, U.N.

Ms. Marano, a songwriter and arranger, plays piano and sings, while Mr. Monteiro uses a unique accordion that houses a miniaturized organ with synthesizer effects as well as a microphone that projects his vocalizing, with its crisply popped scat syllables and lazy hums. The duo is today's equivalent of innovative jazz vocal groups like the Boswell Sisters in the 1930's and Lambert, Hendricks and Ross in the 1950's.

Both items affirm that Furtwangler's extraordinary incandescence in the German repertory was not necessarily a home-grown affair and could be transferred to orchestras foreign in more ways than one. Faced with the murky qualities of these recordings, however, listeners will need assistance in getting the point. A touch of faith helps some, a lot of prior knowledge even more. The orchestral sound in both cases is undernourished, often downright blunted. Yet \"Ring\" lovers willing to put their imaginations and experience to work will fill in various blanks and be well rewarded.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"CATHOLICS JOIN BID BY CONSERVATIVES FOR SCHOOL BOARDS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/nyregion/catholics-join-bid-by-conservatives-for-school-boards.html","abstract":"  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, forging a tactical alliance with a group run by the Rev.

Squaring Off    The effort will put more than 100,000 voters guides prepared by the Robertson group, called the Christian Coalition, in parishes attended by more than one million Catholics in three boroughs, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx. The Diocese of Brooklyn, which includes Brooklyn and Queens, will not distribute the pamphlets because Catholic groups there will make their own recommendations on the candidates.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-91337860980.html","abstract":"What kind of peace plan is it that leaves the chief victims dispossessed?

Something profound in the American spirit fuels a fierce resentment against governmental exactions and the process required to comply with them. Now that most of us have mailed off our 1040's, here, in the spirit of shared experience, are some American quotations -- both negative and (occasionally) positive -- about taxation.\n\nThe power to tax involves the power to destroy.\n\nJohn Marshall, McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819.\n\nOf all debts men are least willing to pay the taxes. What a satire is this on government!\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, \"Politics,\" 1844.\n\nThe income tax is just. It simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the backs of the people. I am in favor of an income tax. When I find a man who is not willing to bear his share of the burdens of the government which protects him, I find a man who is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a government like ours.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, speech at Democratic National Convention, Chicago, July 8, 1896.\n\nWhat is the difference between a taxidermist and a tax collector? The taxidermist takes only your skin.\n\nMark Twain, \"Notebooks,\" Dec. 30, 1902.\n\nallegiance, \n\nn. \n\nthe traditional bond of duty between the taxer and the taxee. It is not reversible.\n\nAmbrose Bierce, \"The Enlarged Devil's Dictionary,\" 1967.\n\nThe Income Tax has made more Liars out of the American people than Golf has. Even when you make one out on the level, you don't know when it's through if you are a Crook or a Martyr.\n\nWill Rogers, \"The Illiterate Digest,\" 1924.\n\nTaxes are what we pay for civilized society.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas v. Collector of Internal Revenue, 1927.\n\nThe power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 1928. \n\nAnyone may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose the pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes.\n\nLearned Hand, Helvering v. Gregory, 1934.\n\nOne sure way to determine the social conscience of a Government is to examine the way taxes are collected and how they are spent. And one sure way to determine the social conscience of an individual is to get his tax-reaction. Taxes, after all, are the dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, campaign address, Worcester, Mass., Oct. 21, 1936.\n\nDeath and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them!\n\nMargaret Mitchell, \"Gone With the Wind,\" 1936.\n\nWhy shouldn't the American people take half my money from me? I took all of it from them.\n\nEdward A. Filene, owner of Filene's department store, quoted by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. in \"The Coming of the New Deal,\" 1959.\n\nDear Mr. President, Internal Revenue regulations will turn us into a nation of bookkeepers. The life of every citizen is becoming a business. This, it seems to me, is one of the worst interpretations of the meaning of human life history has ever seen. Man's life is not a business.\n\nSaul Bellow, \"Herzog,\" 1964.\n\n[\nThe U.S. should\n]\n have a tax system which looks like someone designed it on purpose.\n\nWilliam E. Simon, quoted in \"Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform,\" 1977.\n\nThe American taxing structure, the purpose of which was to serve the people, began instead to serve the insatiable appetite of government. If you will forgive me, you know someone has once likened government to a baby. It is an alimentary canal with an appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other.\n\nRonald Reagan, remarks before a joint session of Parliament, Ottawa, March 11, 1981.\n\nWe don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.\n\nLeona Helmsley, quoted in The New York Times, July 12, 1989.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"Retired Man Is Injured by Bomb in Package","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/nyregion/retired-man-is-injured-by-bomb-in-package.html","abstract":"  A retired sanitation worker was seriously injured yesterday when a package that came through the mail and was left on his doorstep in Brooklyn exploded after he took it into his house, the police said.

Rejoining his friends on a stoop across the street, he lifts the fat bottle trumpet-like to his lips and gulps down the brew in loud, foamy swallows.   \"It gets you nice,\" he says, passing the bottle to an eager friend.    \"It gets you pumped up,\" adds the next boy. \"I feel more comfortable when I'm drinking a 40.\"   Malt liquor -- essentially beer brewed with sugar for an extra alcoholic kick -- has long been popular with black and Hispanic drinkers. But in the outsize 40-ounce bottle, introduced in the late 1980's with aggressive marketing campaigns aimed at minority drinkers, it is fast becoming the intoxicant of choice for black and Hispanic youths in New York and other American cities.    Some teen-agers call malt liquor \"liquid crack\" in tribute to its potency. And to the dismay of drug counselors, social workers and ministers who see malt liquor as a dangerous drug in sheep's clothing, the 40-ounce bottles with brand names like King Cobra, Crazy Horse, Colt 45 and St. Ides have become an accessory to the youth-culture ensemble of baggy clothes, expensive work boots and street-hardened attitudes. \"Tap the Bottle,\" a new song celebrating the consumption of 40-ounce malt liquor, has become a hit on the rap charts.   The essence of the 40 is its combination of size, power and price. At between $1.25 and $2.50, essentially the same as a quart bottle, and with an alcohol content of 5.6 to 8 percent, compared with 3.5 percent for regular beer, the 40-ounce malt liquor offers more punch for the money.   The brewing companies -- which have long been criticized for marketing campaigns that target minority communities -- argue that in selling and promoting the 40-ounce malt liquors, they are simply trying to maintain what has always been a crucial market. But to a chorus of critics, the creation and targeted marketing of the 40 is a cynical attempt to take advantage of poor youngsters in search of a cheap high. The results, they say, can be dangerous and occasionally disastrous, not least because of a misimpression that malt liquor is a relatively harmless pleasure.    \"They are becoming alcoholics and don't even know it,\" said Eric Brent, a recovering cocaine addict who is the founder of Rescue, an anti-addiction program in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. \"Denial is such a monster in their lives.\"   The precise dimensions of the phenomenon are unknowable. But industry analysts say that in the last few years, malt liquor has become the fastest-growing segment of the beer market. And drug counselors and health officials say that while they know of no studies of malt-liquor consumption by young people in the inner city, they see signs of increasing underage drinking linked to the availability of the large bottles.  Seen as Alternative to Drugs    The popularity of the 40's comes as drug-treatment experts and the police are reporting modest drops in teen-age drug use. Some teen-agers in poor neighborhoods now see malt liquor as an alternative to drugs, according to Makani Thaemba, a public policy specialist for the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in San Rafael, Calif.   At the same time, some substance abuse authorities say they have been seeing growing numbers of young people seeking treatment for twin addictions. Increasingly, one of the substances is alcohol, many say, and often that alcohol came by way of malt liquor sold in a 40-ounce bottle.   Some say, too, that they have noticed a growing association between drinking 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor and smoking marijuana. The combination, one teen-ager said, goes together like \"cookies and milk.\"   The Bronx teen-ager who bought the Olde English 800 returned to the grocery store minutes later to purchase a 35-cent Philly Blunt cigar and, as street fad dictates, he hollowed it out and packed it with marijuana to smoke with the malt liquor. Hoisting a 40 for Breakfast    Drinking a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor for breakfast en route to school is not unusual, said a Bronx teen-ager who said he used to do just that. Guzzling 40 ounces to intoxication, others added, is a major attraction at \"hooky parties.\"   \"It is just a thing we did,\" said Clifton W., a 16-year-old Bronx boy who is in treatment for substance abuse. \"It just made me feel good.\"   Fakri A., a 17-year-old from the Bronx who is now in treatment, recalled that he was once so drunk after drinking six 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor that he staggered obliviously through a firefight between drug dealers. \"I guess God was looking out for me that day,\" he mused.   Darryl McDaniels, a 28-year-old member of the rap group Run-DMC, recently told a rap magazine that he had been hospitalized for alcoholic pancreatitis, the result of years of drinking as many as eight 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor a day. 'Pack a Lot of Punch'    The 40-ounce bottle was introduced beginning in the mid-80's as a \"retailer and consumer convenience,\" according to Ron Richards, a spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company, maker of the Magnum brand of malt liquor. Store owners like them, he said, because they take up far less shelf space than six-packs.   And in the wake of their introduction, national malt liquor consumption has increased to 82.9 million 2.5-gallon cases in 1992 from 73.6 million in 1989, according to the Jobson Publishing Corporation's Beer Handbook, which predicts sales of 97.8 million cases this year.   The reason for such sales, market researchers say, is the promise of more alcohol for less money.   \"If you measure your serving size by 40 ounces,\" said Peter Reid, editor of Modern Brewery Age, \"it's going to pack a lot of punch.\"   In a comparative analysis, the Marin Institute found that 40 ounces of St. Ides, which at 8 percent alcohol is one of the most powerful malt liquors, has more alcohol than a six-pack of standard beer, and roughly the same amount as five 5-ounce glasses of wine.   Brewery officials deny that their pursuit of a small but lucrative segment of the American liquor market is an effort to entice underage or irresponsible drinking, and they insist that they are not unduly targeting young minority drinkers. Noting that malt liquor sales have always been the highest among minority drinkers, they say they are simply following the dictates of maintaining a market they want to continue to serve.   \"You obviously gear the advertising of any products to groups that tend to prefer them,\" said Randy Smith, a vice president of the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wis., the maker of Colt 45.   He and officials of other breweries say they regularly advertise against irresponsible and underage drinking. And they say they also sponsor a variety of service activities in minority neighborhoods, from concerts, to literacy programs, to scholarships.   \"The industry is very sensitive and spends a lot of money to be responsible,\" said Frank Walters, director of research for M. Shanken Communications in New York, publishers of Impact and Market Watch, leading trade publications.   Two years ago, Heileman Brewing came under fire from black consumer groups and civil rights organizations after introducing Power Master, its most powerful malt liquor at 5.9 percent alcohol, and marketing it specifically to black drinkers. Regulators ordered it off the market, saying the word \"power\" on the label violated a law against using brand names to promote alcohol content. Linking Success With Liquor    Heileman now faces criticism over an advertising campaign for Colt 45 that is aimed at a younger black consumer than before. Gone is a middle-aged black actor, Billy Dee Williams; instead, a polished, soft-spoken younger black man talks of commitment, giving back and success. As he does, he reaches for a can of Colt 45.   Linking black success with malt liquor is cynical and exploitative, critics of the ads say.   \"All this speaks of a slick marketing campaign that has tremendous impact on African-Americans,\" said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Mr. Butts has led a campaign to stem the advertising of alcohol and tobacco products in poor neighborhoods. Popular at Hooky Parties    Judy Corman, a spokeswoman for Phoenix House, a drug-rehabilitation organization, said she was surprised by the response when she asked a roomful of Manhattan teen-agers recently if they had drunk 40-ounce malt liquor.   \"You should have seen the hands go up,\" she said. \"Nearly everyone raised their hands.\"   Jennifer O. was one of them.   The 15-year-old Bronx high school student said she seldom went to classes last year, preferring instead to attend hooky parties at friends' houses, in basements and on rooftops. \"As long as there was music and people,\" recalled Jennifer, who is Puerto Rican.   \"When I went to hooky parties, we used to have boxes and boxes and boxes of 40 ounces in the refrigerator, and we would go crazy,\" she said. She drank to impress her friends, she said, and her ability to drink two bottles of malt liquor back-to-back earned her the nickname, \"Shorty Two Forties.\"   \"The most I drank was three and a half bottles and I was drunk out of my mind,\" Jennifer said.    When asked if there was anything she regretted about her days of drunken malt liquor binges, she paused, and nodded.   \"I lost my virginity,\" she said, \"when I was drunk on 40's.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"'Cybertronics' Finale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/arts/cybertronics-finale.html","abstract":"  Works by the electronic-music composers Tod Machover and Trimpin form the final concerts of the \"Cybertronics\" Series, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea.

They are Wagner's attempt at writing musical scripture, telling a tale that begins out of the primal watery opening of \"Das Rheingold\" and ends, some 17 hours later, with the fiery immolation of the gods in \"Gotterdammerung.\" In between come \"Die Walkure\" and \"Siegfried\" and an anthology of mythic ingredients. There is a sword buried to the hilt in an ancient tree, a dragon that must be slain, a magic helmet that allows the wearer to change form, a circle of fire through which only a fearless hero may pass. And, of course, the Ring itself; forged from magic gold by a Nibelung dwarf, it grants absolute power to its wearer but also bears a deadly curse.   The tale is beyond simple summary and often strains the faith even of the devout, but it is loaded with the weight of symbols and allusions. In Wagner's version of Original Sin, the ruler of the gods violates his own laws; in the composer's version of the Resurrection, a new world will rise out of the ashes of the old. There are also humbler entertainments, including portraits of marital squabbling and melodramatic villainy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"When State Officials Seize Schools; Education Idea Has Taken Root in New Jersey Since 1986","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/nyregion/when-state-officials-seize-schools-education-idea-has-taken-root-new-jersey.html","abstract":"  Dr. Saul Cooperman says he was standing in his backyard when the idea came to him. \"I remember the exact moment,\" said the former New Jersey Education Commissioner. \"I had been thinking for almost two years: 'How do you improve schools that just don't seem to be able to get it right?' \"    \"Then it hit me,\" he said. \"My God, they declare bankruptcy and go into receivership in the private sector.

Decca/London is currently recording a \"Ring\" conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, and whatever the strengths and weaknesses of that project, it should be fascinating to hear the Cleveland Orchestra in a starring role.   A similar interest attaches to Herbert von Karajan's \"Ring\" with the Berlin Philharmonic (Deutsche Grammophon 435 211-2; 15 CD's), which was recorded in the studio in connection with staged performances of the operas at the Salzburg Easter Festival from 1967 through 1970. The orchestral performance, though never overstated, is superb, and Karajan's conception is thoughtful and compelling; he plays a Wotan of sorts to Georg Solti's Loge in the Decca/ London recording.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930416","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/sports/results-plus-424093.html","abstract":"  N.H.L.
