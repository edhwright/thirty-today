Bradley, who joined the PGA Tour this year and has missed the cut in three of his last five tournaments, got off to a quick start with birdies on the first three holes and four of the first five.

Goetz had nine birdies and five bogeys. Johnson, of Wales, had only one bogey and claimed a share of the lead by sinking a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.

Its founder, Gerard Cosloy, had previously guided Homestead Records through its heyday in the mid-80's, discovering or supporting dozens of great post-punk bands from America and abroad. His newer label embraces a wider array of sounds, more amenable to the new alternative audience and, therefore, more unpredictable.    A case in point is Moonshake, Matador's newest overseas acquisition. This English quartet runs the gamut, sometimes delivering jazzed-up guitar rock, sometimes veering toward a techno-groove sound. David Callahan, the lead singer and guitarist, sings gutter tales in a startling voice, blending Morrissey's warble and John Lydon's sneer; Margaret Fiedler (who plays synthesizer, guitar and vocals) is cooler, her lyrics more insinuating.

The key, it seems, is to think of the programs not as thematic, in the normal sense, but as parodies of thematic programs. That would explain Mr. Zukerman's program, which on the surface accommodated the week's Beethoven and Mozart theme but which actually emphasized distinctions rather than connections.    The opening work, in fact, tore through any presumed bond between the composers. Even on its own terms, Beethoven's brooding, introspective String Quartet in F minor (Op. 95) inhabits a world alien to Mozart at his darkest, and is certainly worlds removed from the program's sole Mozart offering, the Piano Concerto No. 21 in C (K. 467). But on Tuesday, the Beethoven was presented in Mahler's arrangement for string orchestra, a version that tears away the work's last links to Classicism and emphasizes its tendencies toward Romantic high drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930731","headline":"Spanish Peacekeeper Dies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/31/world/us-presses-plans-on-bosnia-defense-spanish-peacekeeper-dies.html","abstract":"  One Spanish soldier attached to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Bosnia was killed today and 17 were wounded, some of them critically, when two mortar rounds hit their headquarters in the town of Jablanica, United Nations officials said.

Klaus Barbie's lawyer, Jacques Verges, claimed he could show that France, Israel and other countries had committed crimes equal to those of the Nazis, citing the use of torture by the French in Algeria and Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.   Mr. Verges's revisionism turned out to be a hollow threat, easily discredited. The real threat to our understanding of the Holocaust was the trial of John Demjanjuk, the Nazi collaborator whose conviction the Israeli Supreme Court has overturned. The prosecution built its case around the presumption that a sword- and whip-wielding Ivan of Treblinka was, as the Israeli prosecutor put it, a more \"major\" war criminal than an ordinary death camp

It was a musical version of the early life of Helen Keller, and there was a simultaneous sign-language translation on the side. Alonzo, a charming but volatile boy, watched the sign language intently and moved his hands in an attempt to mimic and learn. I watched in silent admiration of his desire to know something new. In a few minutes, however, his concentration turned to frustration and he began mumbling and cursing to himself and thrashing to and fro in his seat. I leaned forward to whisper to him and ask what was wrong. He responded angrily, \"I don't know how to do this!\" I explained that nobody could learn sign language that fast and that I'd help him get started when we returned to the classroom. I wondered how many children are labeled behavior problems when it is really just a frustration with their capacities failing to keep up with their ambitions.\nMARCH 31: Had to raise my voice to regain attention during math. Yet even as I want my students to respond to me, I don't want them to think I am criticizing anything but their current behavior. It disturbs me that Evita is so easily cowed.

She doesn't apologize; in fact, she says nothing and conveys no message with her face, but instead, with downcast eyes and immobile features, slowly does what I ask.

While it may suit Leno's image to portray the \"Tonight\" show monologue as something that's banged out over late-night pizza with a few cronies, in fact each joke requires the concerted effort of a crack team of six highly disciplined comedy professionals. To illustrate how it works, let's follow an actual topical joke, told the night of Monday, July 26, as it makes its way through the pipeline.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"'Believe In Your Product'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/arts/l-american-orchestras-believe-in-your-product-949793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The great masterworks of the Old World and the New World are not medicines to be swallowed because they're good for you; they are exciting examples of mankind's highest achievements in art.

The 19th century luxuriated in the new-found pleasure of having its likeness ever within view.   When cheaper forms of photography were devised in the 1850's, the democratizing nature of the medium became ever more evident. Cheapest of all was the tintype, invented in America in 1856. The tiniest images, 36 stamp-size pictures made on a single plate, might sell for as little as 12 for 25 cents.

Critics complain that the series lacks breadth and emphasizes some parts of jazz history at the expense of others. They also say the programs are insular, with the artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, and some of his current and former band members regularly receiving commissions (Mr. Marsalis has gotten one every year) and performing in more than their fair share of the concerts. Inclusion also means exclusion, and virtually every member of the jazz community has ideas about who should be represented but isn't.   There is truth to most of the criticism, and in general the program has been guilty of an astounding clumsiness when it comes to the appearance of impropriety. The series has not once featured a white composer, opening itself up to charges of racism. In May its director, Rob Gibson, fired members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra because they were over 30, only to rescind the dismissals after being apprised of the illegality of the move. The series has also ignored the jazz avant-garde of the 1960's and 1970's. And the regular appearances by Mr. Marsalis's band seem like the work of a patronage system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Early Music Goes Flat in New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/arts/early-music-goes-flat-in-new-york.html","abstract":"  New York does not always lead the international classical-music scene, but it generally follows close behind. Lord knows, it is not the kind of city to get out of the way. Yet in one of the liveliest and most sweeping musical trends of the century, the Early Music movement, New York has seemed oddly content of late to lag far behind not only European cities like London, Amsterdam and Paris but also American ones like Boston and San Francisco.   True, music of the medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods abounds in churches and small halls around New York. But the term Early Music has come to mean more: not only an ancient body of works but an esthetic of performance. Over the last decade, the ethic of period performance practice, originally meant to recreate the long-lost sonorities and styles of genuinely early repertories, has been extended boldly through the 19th century and tentatively into the 20th.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Computer Thieves Hit The Campus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/education/blackboard-computer-thieves-hit-the-campus.html","abstract":"  A WAVE of computer thefts has hit the nation's college campuses and is interfering significantly with student work.    \"There has been an upswing in the last few months at the larger public computing facilities nationwide,\" said Douglas Van Houweling, vice provost for information technology at the University of Michigan. \"Toward the end of a semester a student needs the computers and it becomes a major problem when we lose them due to criminal activity.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Symbols of Summer and Bits of Whimsy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/nyregion/crafts-symbols-of-summer-and-bits-of-whimsy.html","abstract":"  THE New Jersey Designer Craftsmen must have worked hard to create symbols of the lazy days of summer.

The people she knows as her mother and father will be replaced with the two strangers who are her biological parents. Jessica's biological mother gave her up for adoption and named the wrong man as her father. Then she changed her mind and informed the real father.

Let William J. Caunitz put a focus on those woozy feelings of dread. If you buy the harrowing premise of this former New York police lieutenant's smartly researched thriller CLEOPATRA GOLD (Crown, $20), Latin American drug cartels are indeed taking over the country, and they are infinitely more cunning and ruthless than the candy man on the corner. The big dopers Mr. Caunitz writes about use the most sophisticated weapons and communications systems and the latest aerodynamics technology to transport their huge heroin cargos from Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle to New York. And when these guys get testy, they feed their enemies to giant anacondas -- right on the stage of a Manhattan movie theater at 112th and Madison. (O.K., so maybe there's a bit of invention at play here.)   The only hope, it seems, is Alejandro Monahan, a half-Irish, half-Tarascan Mexican nightclub crooner who has infiltrated the Cleopatra network, working as the deepest kind of undercover agent for our side. Alejandro has terrific style, as do the obscenely colorful traficantes.

The title character, a member of the Danish royal family, joins the Franciscans just as Renaissance turns to Reformation. When he flees his suddenly Protestant homeland, Jacob's refugee existence becomes a search for utopia, a quest that steers him into quandaries of spirit evoked through nightmare physicality, often suggesting his tormented countryman Hamlet.

Russian troops now fire across the Tajik border into Afghanistan to hold off supporters of the ousted regime.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Tug of War Emerging Over the 2000 Games","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/sports/olympics-tug-of-war-emerging-over-the-2000-games.html","abstract":"  The city in question is Beijing in the year 2000, but the answer is Berlin 1936.

I had brought my storybook home from school in Connecticut; in my boredom I read it over and over. Thus I became fluent at reading for the first time, and discovered the bliss of abandonment to print, to word and story. From the love of reading eventually derived the desire to write, a lifelong commitment to making things that might (if I were diligent, talented and lucky) resemble the books I loved reading.\n\nReading and writing have filled the days of my life, good times and bad ones, reflecting passages of love, despair, anger and joy. Reading and writing take their places even in mourning and in fear of death. Through words I remember my first consciousness of mortality. When I was 9 and a great-aunt died, I lay in bed after the funeral, staying awake to repeat a sentence in my head: \"Now death has become a reality.\" It was as if I were reading my biography, and \"at the age of 9,\" the book said, \"death became a reality for Donald Hall.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Corporate Cutbacks Produce New Entrepreneurs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/nyregion/corporate-cutbacks-produce-new-entrepreneurs.html","abstract":"NO one said it would be easy.

Davis (1892-1964) incorporated this country's commercial icons into modern painting (anticipating Pop Art) in works like \"Lucky Strike\" (1921), and rewrote Cubism as a syncopated New World symphony, jazzing it up and making hot colors and hard-edged forms dance on a shallow stage. \"The amazing continuity\" is his own phrase: it appears as a slogan blazoned in black letters on the 1951 painting \"Visa.\" Lewis Kachur points out that for Davis, the line separating writing, drawing and painting was quite thin.

Its docks and quays bustled with commerce coming from and going to the New World. Culturally, too, this was Dublin's golden age. Jonathan Swift, who was dean of St. Patrick's, was writing his brilliant, vitriolic satires. In 1742 the world premiere of Handel's \"Messiah\" was presented at the Music Hall in Fishamble Street. The theater flourished. \"The School for Scandal,\" by the Irish-born playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, gives a good sense of fashionable life in the city.\n\nNowhere did this vitality express itself so impressively as in the domestic architecture commissioned by Dublin's Anglo-Irish elite. The most common style for aristocratic mansions was Palladian; later in the century, as more English and Irish visited Rome and Greece on their grand tours, a taste evolved for a purer classicism. During the past two decades, two outstanding 18th-century Irish buildings have been restored to their former glory. One of them, Newman House, is a grand Palladian structure typical of Dublin in its prime. The other, the Casino at Marino, is considered by many experts the finest classical building to be seen in Ireland.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Fishing Countries Split on Harvest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/world/fishing-countries-split-on-harvest.html","abstract":"  Rival fishing nations grimly acknowledged this week that their fleets have thinned out stocks of the world's edible marine fish to levels unimaginable only a few years ago, and that only coordinated conservation and management steps will restore them.
