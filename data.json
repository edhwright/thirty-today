Whatever evils John Demjanjuk may have committed as a Nazi guard, the investigation that sent him from Cleveland to Israel for a war crimes trial was bungled. It's unlikely that Israel will conduct another trial. Thus the only effective way to restore order and honor is for the Justice Department to bring Mr. Demjanjuk, who was acquitted of the most serious charges against him, back to the United States to determine his ultimate home and citizenship.    Mr. Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born auto worker, was accused a decade ago of being the sadistic guard \"Ivan the Terrible\" of Treblinka, the death camp in Poland where nearly a million Jews were exterminated. He was stripped of his American citizenship, held deportable and extradited for a murder trial in Israel, where he was convicted and sentenced to death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930805","headline":"Salzburg: Theater Makes Inroads","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/05/theater/salzburg-theater-makes-inroads.html","abstract":"  Even with Gerard Mortier's modernist reforms, the Salzburg Festival is still thought of as a celebration of music and opera.

With the aid of Peter Stein, a German director, that ambition has been triumphantly achieved, in a way that even Mr. Mortier's many enemies are compelled to applaud.

The league was also told that while use of the drugs has diminished over the last five years, there still remains a significant number of players who use steroids, and those players think they can easily circumvent the testing procedures. N.F.L. policy prohibits players from using anabolic steroids, which are generally believed to add to muscle bulk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930805","headline":"Foot-Dragging on War Crimes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/05/opinion/foot-dragging-on-war-crimes.html","abstract":"  With much huffing and puffing, the United Nations pledged in February to establish an international tribunal to prosecute war crimes in the Balkans. Seven months after this Security Council declaration, little has happened. The tribunal has only a token budget and scarcely a staff, and not a single case file has been opened. Yet action along these lines would risk no lives -- indeed, might save lives -- and could begin to counter the frustration and cynicism as ethnic cleansers murder, rape, bomb and steal.    Granted, there are difficulties. When World War II ended the Allies ruled Germany and Japan, and many accused war criminals were already in detention. The U.N. is only a lightly armed interlocutor in the former Yugoslavia.

Giving shelter to people in need has been an Albanian tradition that benefited many Montenegrins and Bosnians before World War II, the Jewish community when our country was occupied by the Nazis and numerous Greeks who fled into Albania in the late 1940's because of the political and military circumstances in their homeland.   Now, as other European, Middle Eastern and Asian countries have done, Albania is receiving thousands of refugees from Bosnia, mostly women and children, despite very limited resources. But this only and nothing else is foreseen in the various Albanian talks and agreements with the Bosnian authorities. The Albanian Government would never allow any use of these camps for other purposes and will provide access there for anybody who might want to check them.   As for the Albanian negative vote to the admission of Macedonia into the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, it is only conditioned by the failing of the Macedonian Government to give the Albanian community living there the rights it was committed to give, such as proportional representation in the state apparatus, more schools, an Albanian university and more access in the national news media.   Furthermore, the Albanians in Macedonia are crucially supporting the internal stability of that young state. Many international community leaders have publicly recognized that the Republic of Albania, with its commitment to peace and to easing tensions, its opposition to any violent change of borders and its realistic policy, has made a major contribution to stability in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula.

The company has long been a magnet for opera lovers, and this season, which company officials say will cost nearly $8 million, has several lures, including the new \"Flute\" staging and new productions of Handel's too rarely heard \"Xerxes,\" Strauss's \"Capriccio\" and a Kurt Weill double bill of \"The Tsar Has His Photograph Taken\" with the American premiere of \"The Protagonist.\" All are to be sung in English.

One would not expect less from a report that promises to continue the past's failed policies. The findings seem to acknowledge that cutthroat competition and a frantic drive for monopoly are to blame for today's problems. But our experience of how unlimited deregulation stirs predatory corporate behavior seems to be ignored.   Instead, the commmission appears to endorse even less regulation, rather than reregulation, proposing to transfer the functions of the Federal Aviation Administration to an independent self-financed (and undoubtedly industry-run) corporation.

Dorothy Donegan, a throwback to the days when jazz musicians were often a part of show business, has managed to combine her showmanship with musical virtuosity and a strong jazz sensitivity, a combination that often blinded jazz purists to her skills. Now approaching 70, she is usually not as rambunctious as she once was, but she can still turn on the heat when she wants to. To help her shift into various moods, her trio includes her longtime drummer, Ray Mosca, who understands every twist of her fingers and every stomp of her foot. With Jerome Hunter on bass, they play tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. The cover charge is $15 and the minimum is $8 tonight and tomorrow. On Sunday the cover is $12 but the minimum is still $8. Volatile Sounds    Versus and Scrawl, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-3055. Buzzing, droning, ticking and pounding, Versus plays rock songs that implode. All of a sudden, calm declarations like \"I don't care\" are torn apart by jagged guitar chords and bursts of noise, as if social decorum could no longer contain emotional turmoil. Scrawl, a long-running college-circuit band, plays scruffy, straightforward tales of troubled romance and day-to-day tension. The quadruple bill, with Coral and Kepone opening, begins tonight at 9; tickets are $8.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"Rarities Amid a Trove of Ellingtonia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/arts/pop-jazz-rarities-amid-a-trove-of-ellingtonia.html","abstract":"  \"Paris Blues,\" released in 1961, is one of those slight slivers of a film that pretty much deserves its obscurity. Paul Newman pitches woo at Joanne Woodward. Sidney Poitier pitches woo at Diahann Carroll. The two men, jazz musicians living in Paris, have to decide whether to stay in France or return to America. End of movie, and off to the cultural dustbin.   Except for one thing. As all this woo gets thrown around, Duke Ellington's extraordinary score for the film rumbles along behind the semi-activity. A virtually unknown piece of Ellingtonia, the soundtrack uses everything from small bands to a large orchestra, and it's a magnificently rich, if jumbled, work. It comes from a crucial year, 1960, that saw Ellington recording \"The Nutcracker Suite,\" the \"Peer Gynt Suites,\" \"The Asphalt Jungle Suite,\" \"The Queen's Suite\" and \"Suite Thursday.\" Ellington was in an especially prolific period. The score to the movie sprawls, glittering with beautiful melodies and graceful interludes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930806","headline":"U.S. Asks Allies to Broaden Threats Against Serb Forces","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/06/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-us-asks-allies-to-broaden-threats-against-serb-forces.html","abstract":"  The United States is pressing NATO to broaden its threatened air strikes against Serbian forces to include roads, bridges, supply depots and command posts, senior officials said today.
