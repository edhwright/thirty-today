And by creating full-evening ballets, choreographers can spin rousing narratives on the grandest of scales.    The trouble is, they keep telling the same stories. They borrow from Shakespeare and other literary classics, or they choose a well-known fairy tale. The results are often bores -- epic bores. A dull one-act ballet will come to an end in, say, half an hour. But a lackluster full-evening work natters on for act after act. Who needs another plodding \"Romeo and Juliet,\" simpering \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" or saccharine \"Cinderella\"? Yet year after year those kinds of ballets clog the repertories of companies around the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/books/in-short-fiction.html","abstract":"THE ORIENT-EXPRESS\nBy Gregor von Rezzori.\nKnopf, $21.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/realestate/residential-resales-967193.html","abstract":"  Closings in the week ended March 6  MANHATTAN  Chelsea  $318,000   120 West 20th Street  2-bedroom, 2-bath, 1,800-sq.-ft. loft-co-op; elevator, dining area, fireplace, exposed brick walls, 3 exposures; maintenance $780, 41% tax-deductible (Brokers: Silverman Group-Ambrose Mar-Elia)  SoHo  $265,000   292 Lafayette Street  2-bedroom, 1-bath, 1,500-sq.-ft. loft-co-op; raised dining area, 11-ft. ceilings, exposed brick walls; maintenance $595, 48% tax-deductible (Broker: Eychner Associates)  Upper East Side  $1.1 million   641 Fifth Avenue  (Olympic Towers)  2-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath, 1,700-sq.-ft. condo; 24-hr. doorman, concierge, manned elevator, south exposure; common charge $1,214, taxes $1,362 a month (Brokers: Corcoran Group-Charles H.

He never had to contend with music critics. If he had, some would undoubtedly have found his lyre playing cool, unemotional, uninvolved.

Mr. Pollini, who will give his final New York recital of the season on Saturday evening at Carnegie Hall, seems to have cornered the market in qualified adulation.   \"Technically, he already plays better than any of us on the jury,\" said Arthur Rubinstein, setting the tone for later commentary in 1960, when the 18-year-old Mr. Pollini won the Chopin Competition in Warsaw. Praise for Mr. Pollini's godlike technique in the decades since has been virtually unanimous, but at least in the United States, many have found the pianist wanting in the temperament, flair and sensibility of the great virtuosos of the first half of the century, exemplified most recently by Vladimir Horowitz.

Eventually he tried just about all the arts: sculpture, drawing, theater decor, cinema and writing.

Built in a bloated and awkward neo-classical style at a time -- the 1840's and 50's -- when neo-classicism no longer came naturally, it manages to look at the same time too big and oddly shrunken, in part because the flattened dome sits so unpleasantly on the rest of the church.

And in the 1950's and early 60's, Fillmore below California Street served as the heart of the African-American community until redevelopment ripped apart the neighborhood, tearing down acres of Victorian houses and transforming the jazz clubs and rib joints into boarded-up storefronts and vacant lots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Susan T.

Rather it aspires to demonstrate, in the ambitious, quasi-sociological manner of the newer art history, \"what portraiture meant in terms of 18th-century English culture and society.\" As Marcia Pointon shows in her highly discerning discussions of several \"conversation pieces\" (a favorite 18th-century subgenre that depicted placid family groups in domestic settings), portraits served as \"a form of quasi-legal genealogical statement\" for both the aristocracy and the gentry. One chapter of \"Hanging the Head\" is devoted to the physical location of portraits, establishing how and where they were hung (hence the rather awkward title). Elsewhere Ms. Pointon, who teaches art history at the University of Manchester, considers portraiture as a trade, \"a highly developed business in a buyer's market,\" detailing how even successful portrait painters were forced to endure the almost unbelievable arrogance and penuriousness of aristocratic patrons. The oddest but not the least fascinating chapter, entitled \"Dangerous Excrescences: Wigs, Hair and Masculinity,\" sets forth in extraordinary detail the fetishistic significance of the wigs seen in so many portraits of 18th-century gentlemen. When Ms. Pointon does pause to scrutinize individual works -- a series of portraits of prepubescent girls, portraits of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Turkish dress -- her analyses can be brilliant and arrestingly phrased.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Fire Safety Laws Need Strengthening","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/nyregion/l-fire-safety-laws-need-strengthening-177393.html","abstract":"  I read with interest your article \"After a Fireman Dies, Questions About Staffing and Equipment\"  [ March 7 ] , about the tragic death of the White Plains firefighter Warren Ogburn, who died during a blaze at Grant Manor, the high-rise apartment at South Lexington and Maple Avenues in White Plains.

The 28-year-old world champion scored 10-3 in the elite invitational competition, which included an imposing selection of his chief rivals.   Kasparov's prize came to less than $10,000, a paltry amount for such an important event. But that does not tell all: the real money in Linares is in the appearance fees, and these are kept secret.  FINAL STANDINGS        Player   Pts.                     Kasparov   10        Karpov   8 1/2        V. Anand   8 1/2        A. Shirov   8        V. Kramnik   7 1/22        V. Salov   6 1/2        V.

Ljubojevic   4         Kasparov's tremendous skill in attacking shone forth in his Round 10 victory over the former world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia.   The first surprise was Kasparov's recapture, 10 . . . Ne5!?, which amounted to a sacrifice of the d6 pawn -- on 11 b3 Ne8, there would have come 12 c5!   On 13 . . . Nfd7, Karpov could not develop with 14 Ng3? Nf3 15 gf Bc3. And 14 Bd4 Re8 (threatening 15 . . . Bf8!) 15 Be5 Re5 16 Qc6 Ra6 17 Rd7 Qe8! 18 Qc7 Bd7 is lost for White because his tiny material advantage is no compensation for Black's enormous lead in development. Karpov tried 14 f4, but Kasparov struck back sharply with 14 . . . b4!, one point being that accepting the second pawn offer with 15 Qb4 would have allowed 15 . . . c5! 16 Bc5 Nc5! 17 Rd8 Ned3 18 Kd2 Nb4 19 Rf8 Kf8, winning a piece for two pawns.   And, on 15 Na4, Kasparov would have had 15 . . . Ra4! 16 ba Nc4 17 Qd3 Nb2 18 Qc2 Nd1 19 Qd1 Qa5 20 Kf2 Nf6 21 Ng3 Ng4 with strong attacking chances.   Karpov tried 21 h4 in the hope of getting his KR to help out with 22 Rh3, but Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to open lines with 21 . . . c4! (22 bc? would permit 22 . . . b3! followed by 23 . . . Qa5).   After 22 Nc1, Kasparov charged in with 22 . . . c3! 23 Na2 c2. Had Karpov defended by 24 Rc1, there could have followed 24 . . . cb/Q 25 Rb1 Ne5! 26 Rd1 (26 Qe3 Ng4!) Qa5 27 fe Qa2 28 Qe3 Nc3 29 Rc1 Re8 30 Rc3 bc 31 Qc3 Bg4 32 Bd3 Rc8 33 Bc4 Qb1, winning a rook.   Perhaps the most remarkable twist of Kasparov's onslaught was that, after 24 Qd4 cd/Q 25 Kd1 (25 Qd1 Qb6 is a nightmare for White), he forced the exchange of queens by 25 . . . Ndc5! 26 Qd8 Rd8 without giving up anything of his mighty momentum.    After 27 Kc2 (27 Ke1 Bg4! 28 Be2 Be2 29 Ke2 Ng3 garners a rook) Nf2, Karpov overstepped the time limit. That spared him the agony of 28 Rg1 Bf5 29 Kb2 Rd1.

That's the hidden message behind the conspicuously awful haircuts of some current leading men. An actor with bad hair is the equivalent of an actress doing an unglamorous turn (think of Cher looking plain in \"Moonstruck\") -- a sign he cares so much about his art, he's willing to ugly up. Here is a sampler of top stars who have been acting with their hair. Michael Douglas in \"Falling Down\" -- The nerd du jour look says emphatically that this is    not    Michael Douglas, sex symbol. No nude posteriors, no ice picks. The seriously bad hair also says that this is a movie with a message, though the message may be that Mr. Douglas is paying homage to. . . Al Pacino in \"The Godfather Part III\" -- This is the haircut that was so distracting, some people couldn't pay attention to the movie. Who knows why the aging Michael Corleone got a spiky brush-cut? Maybe the porcupine look was supposed to keep rival families away. Kevin Costner in \"The Bodyguard\" -- This cut perpetuates the myth that secret service agents have to look as conspicuous as possible. Some people have speculated that this bad hair is an homage to Steve McQueen, for whom the movie was originally written. More likely it is an homage to . . .  Harrison Ford in \"Presumed Innocent\" -- There are two possible explanations for this cut. As a dedicated lawyer, the Ford character wants to look like Julius Caesar. Or, the hair is a red herring, deflecting attention from the true murderer and any holes in the plot.  Robert De Niro in \"Mad Dog and Glory\" -- Sometimes he gains 50 pounds to play a role. Sometimes he gets his hair cut the way it must have looked in third grade. Living with this 'do inspired him in playing the meek, mild-mannered Mad Dog. Robin Williams in \"Toys\" -- No, he isn't entering a Barry Manilow look-alike contest. The dyed-blond hair suggests a man so in touch with his inner child that his hair has never darkened. Or, maybe he's just trying to look like Rod Stewart. Sean Connery in \"Medicine Man\" -- In this classic hair strategy, the ponytail compensates for a receding hairline. The character, a scientist who has spent years in the jungle, could be an aging hippy, or a SoHo art dealer who hasn't heard that the 80's are over. Daniel Day-Lewis in \"The Last of the Mohicans\" -- The ultimate in Romantic hair. Never mind that the character is engaged in the French and Indian War. In another century, Keats and Shelley would have killed for hair like this. For that matter, so would have Madame Bovary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Cleaning Out New York's 'Attic'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/opinion/cleaning-out-new-york-s-attic.html","abstract":"  If the Smithsonian Institution is the nation's attic, then the 189-year-old New-York Historical Society is New York's.

If the music industry cared a fig, radio stations would advertise Retin-A as often as Oxy-5, and superstores like Tower Records wouldn't have clerks with pierced eyebrows and bell-bottoms who sneer at the mention of Joan Armatrading.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Alison Wilbur, Mark Thompson","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/style/weddings-alison-wilbur-mark-thompson.html","abstract":"  Alison Mary Wilbur, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Elisha P.

This novel, set in the 19th century, shows how the lives of two very different people -- the daughter of a West Indian plantation owner and one of his slaves -- become entwined in a tragedy.

(Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) Women are neither worse nor better than men, argues the social psychologist Carol Tavris. She examines the fallacies inherent in much of the research comparing the sexes, and concludes that while women and men often do different things, their dissimilar behavior does not translate into differences in ability. \"The great virtue of this book is that its author never confuses the very real differences in women's and men's experiences -- pregnancy and childbearing being the most obvious -- with the cultural artifacts surrounding these undeniable facts of life,\" Susan Jacoby said here last year. Also out in paperback is THE WAR AGAINST WOMEN (Ballantine, $12), in which Marilyn French documents the institutional and cultural weapons used to perpetuate female inequality in both Western and third world nations. Last year our reviewer, Isabelle de Courtivron, called it \"a sobering reminder that the situation of women may still be so universally abysmal that if any other ethnic, national or religious group were attacked, dominated and maimed at the same rate, it could be said to constitute a state of emergency or war.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"How Violence Moved Center Stage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/nyregion/theater-how-violence-moved-center-stage.html","abstract":"  FIRST you wince.

Assinger edged Werner Perathoner of Italy by .08 seconds on the 3,007-meter course on Kvitfjell mountain. Austria's Hannes Trinkl was .13 seconds behind in third place, matching his career best. William Besse of Switzerland placed fourth. Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway finished tied for fifth, a career-best finish in the downhill. But Marc Girardelli, who shared fifth with Aamodt and Josef Polig of Italy, retained a commanding lead in the overall points standing over the Norwegian with five races left this season.

The victory moved Seizinger within 50 points of the Austrian Anita Wachter, the World Cup overall leader. Wachter, suffering a slump late in the season, finished 20th and collected only 11 points for a total of 1,166. The World Cup season ends next week at Are, Sweden.

The final 286 miles (188 laps) were run under the green flag and, at the end, it was a fuel-economy run, with Shepherd going the longest without having to stop. Ernie Irvan, who stopped three laps later than Shepherd, wound up second, his Chevrolet Lumina trailing Shepherd's Ford Thunderbird across the finish line by 23.5 seconds.

Steiner, the top-seeded wrestler at 134 pounds after winning the 142-pound title last year, was upset by Penn State's fourth-seeded Cary Kolat in Friday's semifinals. But he rebounded in the consolation round with a pin over Oklahoma's Ryan Hager in 52 seconds before outpointing Fergeson, 8-4.

Just having fun isn't enough; there has to be a fillip of transgression, too, a feeling of deliberately and deliciously breaking some rule. Those who worry that therapeutic ideas and other secular-humanist notions have dispelled old feelings of sinfulness can take some comfort in the continuing popularity of Depeche Mode, a band that finds fear in every desire and temptation in every fear. \"I give in to sin,\" the song \"Strangelove\" proclaimed in 1987, \"because you have to make this life livable.\" But that doesn't prevent the band from agonizing over every passion on its new album, \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\" (Mute/Sire 4-45243; CD and cassette).    Depeche Mode, an English band whose name is French for \"fast fashion,\" has become hugely popular, filling concert halls with screaming black-clad teen-age girls while going nearly unnoticed among people over 25. At times, the group is just an inflection away from parody. David Gahan, the singer, is a baritone crooner dispensing the emotional signals -- the breathy importunings, the broad vibrato -- of a particularly self-important lounge act; the music has an echoing grandiosity that verges on melodrama. Yet that very solemnity assures adolescent listeners that others understand their private and encompassing dilemmas, providing a kind of consolation. In \"Personal Jesus,\" the singer offers to be \"Someone to hear your prayers/ Someone who cares.\" A lot of fans want just that.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Study Seems to Ease Fear on Low Cholesterol Level","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/us/study-seems-to-ease-fear-on-low-cholesterol-level.html","abstract":"  A new study should ease lingering concerns that some people may be harmed by reducing their blood cholesterol levels.

But for how long? Some maintain that Trollope began to be widely read again only after the pioneering work of Michael Sadleir, his biographer and bibliographer, in the 1920's. Others assert that the real revival came during World War II, when nostalgia for the \"peaceful world\" of his novels brought solace to war-ravaged Britain. Still others believe he has been resurrected only lately, through the television serialization of the Palliser novels in the 1970's and of the Barchester novels in the 1980's. And some date the Trollope revival from the founding of the London-based Trollope Society in 1987, an organization that has successfully lobbied for Trollope's entry into Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. \n\nActually, these explanations have it wrong. The activities of Sadleir, the television series and the Trollope Society, while they helped to increase Trollope's readership, for the most part reflected his popularity rather than created it. The only accurate gauge of a writer's popularity is publishers' sales. The pronouncements of \"experts,\" academics or critics, are really not worth much. Publishers bring out books to sell them; and when books sell well, publishers issue new printings and editions. For the last century, while many critics relegated Trollope to a secondary position among the major British novelists, publishers have been printing his books to wide and steady markets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930321","headline":"Queens Commuters' Gift: Free Transfers on Buses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/nyregion/queens-commuters-gift-free-transfers-on-buses.html","abstract":"  Hoping to address a longstanding complaint about mass transit in Queens, the Dinkins administration announced on Friday that it would soon allow commuters in the borough to transfer free from city buses to private ones.

To recast the line about how crucial location is in real estate, the three most important aspects of complaining are timing, timing and timing. A complaint must be lodged while something can be done to make things right because, as one tour executive put it, money does not replace lost vacation time. A letter sent a month after a traveler returns from a trip is less likely to get results than a phone call made on the spot, saying, for example, that a hotel does not correspond to the description in the brochure.

Ms. Akalaitis, it soon became clear, simply did not know enough about what it means to be a producer, and the consequences of that ignorance were severe.    In the mere 20 months she presided as artistic director, the company that Papp built over three decades became an empty shell, a ragtag fairway for theatrical sideshows rather than main events. The institution that had once been a role model for nonprofit theaters nationwide and a leader in New York City arts advocacy found its own long-term survival thrown into jeopardy. Last week the festival's board stepped in and dismissed Ms. Akalaitis, replacing her with George C. Wolfe. In a typically theatrical gesture, the 38-year-old Mr. Wolfe made it known that he would not be the festival's artistic director.

The Staten Island home port means jobs and economic activity in a recession-strapped city. But its champions no longer have a convincing argument.   The Navy's elaborate and costly system of dispersing the fleet to every Congressional district with a port never had a strong military rationale and was always a classic example of \"port barrel\" politics.

But the farmers like to point out that unlike the growers of other crops whose prices are supported by the Government, they receive help that entails no net cost to the taxpayers -- that is, no \"subsidies\" in the usual sense.   The tobacco growers' boast, although accurate today, has been strictly true only in the last 11 of the 60 years since the Federal price-support program for tobacco was adopted. And even during this latter period, the Government has had to step in to bail the growers out once, in 1986. The cost was $1.1 billion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/arts/dance-in-review-573893.html","abstract":"  'A Tin Soldier on the Seashore of Jerusalem' Arie Bursztyn  The Kitchen","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/nyregion/c-corrections-550993.html","abstract":"  An entry in the People listing on the Media Business page on Tuesday about the appointment of James Putnam as chief of staff of Media Inc. misstated his previous title.

And they have been good enough to make the entire National Basketball Association take notice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Yeltsin's Dangerous Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/opinion/yeltsins-dangerous-game.html","abstract":"Russia has been on the brink of a second Bolshevik revolution orchestrated by Communist apparatchiks in Parliament who were elected in 1990 by a system rigged in their favor and led by its unscrupulous Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov. The coup would scuttle free-market reforms, install a dictatorship and revive the cold war. Faced by this threat, Boris Yeltsin had no choice but to assume nearly unlimited emergency powers.\n\nThis is President Yeltsin's justification for taking over the Government.

By no means reflecting the full breadth of achievement in its chosen field, the program tended toward the intimate and unambitious. Cecile Chaminade's \"Concertino,\" for flute and piano, and Mrs. H. H. A. Beach's Three Pieces, for cello and piano, were both agreeable turn-of-the-century confections. Jane L. Komarov's \"Suite From 'My Name Is Natasha' \" and Jacqueline B. Hairston's bluesy \"Melismodal Suite,\" both for piano, were witty and bluesy, respectively. Tamara Bliss's Three Pieces for piano and Beth Anderson's \"Doctor Blood's Mermaid Lullaby,\" for cello and piano, were both nondescript.   A trio for flute, cello and piano by Marcelle de Manziarly (1899-1989) began in a spacious post-impressionist idiom, although it turned dull in a concluding \"ecossaise.\" Mira J. Spektor, Aviva's director, contributed an aria from her opera in progress, \"Mary Shelley,\" and also an operettalike number, \"Guinevere Among the Grapefuit Peels\"; these were hard to judge out of context but seemed lyrically underpowered.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL: Southeast; Willard Puts the W.

The asterisk means that while he endorses open international markets, he has also campaigned as someone not afraid to use confrontation and reprisal. Sometimes he seems to veer toward reflexive protectionism, as with the threat to placate Detroit by putting punitive tariffs on Japanese mini-vans.    But there is one area where Mr. Clinton's tough-cop act could produce huge dividends without damaging free-trade principles: international airline travel. U.S. policy calls for so-called open-skies treaties that give carriers unfettered access to foreign airports. But Europe stubbornly rejects open skies out of fear that U.S. behemoths like American and United will drive its bloated carriers back down onto the tarmac. So travel remains governed by restrictive bilateral treaties that prevent airlines from going head to head to capture customers with lower ticket prices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930322","headline":"Players in Battle for New York Post Squabble on TV","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/22/nyregion/players-in-battle-for-new-york-post-squabble-on-tv.html","abstract":"  Click.

Yet the pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later choice they and others pose is less hard-boiled analysis than wishful thinking, and it reflects a failure to imagine the immense problems that will flow from the failure of Russian democracy.    Increasing the defense budget bought security during the cold war. It will buy much less if things now go wrong in Russia. The real cost we face is not the loss of the peace dividend, but the loss of American pre-eminence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930323","headline":"Figured Out the Derby With Six Weeks to Go?

Doubleday. $19.95.     Both the themes and the characters of \"Poet and Dancer,\" Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's 11th novel, uncannily echo those of \"In Search of Love and Beauty,\" a novel she published exactly 10 years ago. Both novels concern the fragmentation of family life experienced by immigrants in New York. Both novels feature a similar cast of people, including gurulike charlatans who seduce wealthy women with their promises of salvation; older matrons who end up leading lonely, desperate lives, and the offspring of these people, who drift aimlessly through life in search of love and connection.   This time the reader is introduced to Anna and Siegfried Manarr, wealthy German immigrants who have made a home for themselves in Manhattan. Assiduously devoted to each other, Anna and Siegfried spend their free time going to concerts and art exhibits. Having come from families who have prospered in business for generations, they dream of having children with artistic talent.   Instead, their son, Hugo, becomes a sort of new-age guru who dreams of \"fashioning a new humanity.\" He marries a flighty woman named Alice, one of those familiar Jhabvala characters who travel the third world looking for meaning, and they have a pretty, high-strung daughter named Lara. Hugo's sister, Helena, meanwhile marries a wealthy businessman named Peter, and raises a shy, introspective daughter called Angel.   Angel and her cousin Lara meet briefly as young girls, and both vow to pursue artistic careers: Lara will become a dancer; Angel, a poet.   Years pass in which the girls do not see each other. Angel grows up to be a shy, serious girl, unhealthily dependent on her mother. Lara grows up to be a world-class neurotic and flirt.   Beautiful, vivacious and emotionally needy, Lara collects admirers and hangers-on the way a lepidopterist collects butterflies. One of her chief admirers is Angel, who quickly transfers on to her all her needs to be needed. Her other big admirer is Angel's father, Peter, who soon sets her up in a hotel room as his mistress.   Intercut with the incestuous tale of Lara, Angel and Peter are other stories of love and loneliness in Manhattan. Mrs. Jhabvala shows Helena compensating for her daughter's absence by befriending a superstitious widow from India named Mrs. Arora, who has lost her eldest son in a bloody fight in prison. Peter's mother, Mrs. Koenig, meanwhile, tries to compensate for    her    son's absence by befriending Rose, her new maid. Each of these friendships is supposed to make up for more conventional family ties, but as in so much of Mrs. Jhabvala's fiction, love breeds disappointment and regret, not solace and safety.   When Peter grows sick of paying hotel bills for Lara, he comes up with another plan: he decides to install her in an apartment with his daughter, Angel. Despite the protestations of her mother, Angel jumps at the idea, and she and Lara soon become inseparable pals. It's hardly a friendship of equals. In fact, the two women quickly come to resemble one of those infernal pairings found in so many of Anita Brookner's novels: Lara is the imperious, bossy, selfish one, constantly making importunate demands on Angel's time and attention; Angel is the meek, passive one, always eager to please.   Their hermetic relationship seems meant to protect the two women from the realities of the outside world, and it leads, predictably enough, to a dangerous mutual dependency. Angel abandons her poetry-writing; Lara abandons her dance. Lara actively tries to turn Angel against her old friends, and she begins demanding that Angel spend all her time at home. As Lara's behavior grows more and more erratic -- she starts stealing things from stores, and baiting Peter's wife -- Angel begins giving her large doses of tranquilizers. Confusion and hostility soon take over their daily routines and gradually infect the rest of the Manarr clan as well.   Mrs. Jhabvala writes with such fluency and poise that \"Poet and Dancer\" flies by with almost no effort from the reader. Her subsidiary characters, as usual, are delineated with deft, ironic strokes, and together they leave the reader with the pleasant sense of being immersed in a convincing fictional world. We are made to see the ways in which emotional needs and scars are handed down from father to son, mother to daughter, and we are made to appreciate the difficulty of erasing these patterns.   Still, the reader finishes \"Poet and Dancer\" vaguely dissatified and filled with a lingering sense of deja vu. The story of Angel and Lara feels mechanistic and predictable in the end: as young girls and later as women, they are almost completely defined by a single personality trait or two, traits that practically condemn them to their unhappy fates. Halfway through the book, we know where these characters are headed, and sure enough, we are given no surprises -- or further emotional revelations -- by the novel's end.   Mrs. Jhabvala has written similar stories before, and done so with considerably more complexity and insight.
