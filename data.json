According to network insiders, NBC has valued the Super Bowl at $40 million. There is no N.F.L.-specified Super Bowl rights fee, and a network can allocate its Super Bowl fee in any way it wishes.    To balance the $40 million cost, NBC is charging $850,000 for 30-second commercial spots during the game.

For parents of the mentally and emotionally disabled, those issues sometimes seem impossible. The confusion is made worse by the fact that the expert thinking on the subject keeps changing. For decades, doctors, therapists and families did not even speak of sexuality and the mentally retarded. Then, in recent years, sexual expression has come to be seen as a right. A1.    More testimony in Glen Ridge assault case. B4. NEW YORK CITY POST'S RESCUER'S FINANCIAL DEALINGS   Steven Hoffenberg, who suddenly emerged as the possible buyer of The New York Post, built a small credit business into a nearly $700 million financial services company and along the way set off frequent lawsuits and battles with Federal and state securities regulators. A1.   TRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP OF THE POST   The New York Post has gained a new but relatively short lease on life as a wealthy businessman has agreed to buy the newspaper and to cover any losses it might incur over the next four weeks while he tries to put a deal together to save it. Peter S. Kalikow, The Post's owner, said that he and the prospective buyer, Steven Hoffenberg, had hammered out a complex plan to transfer ownership of the debt-ridden, 191-year-old tabloid. B3.    HOSPITAL PLANS ADDITION   The New York Hospital will construct a 776-bed building on a platform above the Franklin D.

The hospital plans to start construction in April and complete the 12-story, $908 million building in 1998. B3. REGION SENTENCING IN KIDNAPPING   Irene J. Seale was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her part in the fatal kidnapping last year of a top Exxon executive, Sidney J. Reso.

RETIREMENT PACKAGE IS CHALLENGED   Calling a $963,000 retirement package for a Long Island school superintendent illegal and excessive, State Attorney General Robert Abrams has filed suit to void the contract and recoup most of the money. The award to Dr. Edward J. Murphy, a public employee for 42 years who retired as superintendent of the Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Suffolk County in October, was among the largest in state history and created an immediate political uproar.B5.

Rehnquist wrote the 6-to-3 majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas; Justice Byron R. White did not sign the opinion but concurred in the result. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter. FROM THE OPINION By Chief Justice Rehnquist    Petitioner Leonel Torres Herrera was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in January 1982. He unsuccessfully challenged the conviction on direct appeal and state collateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a Federal habeas petition. In February 1992, 10 years after his conviction he urged in a second Federal habeas petition that he was \"actually innocent\" of the murder for which he was sentenced to death, and that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process of law therefore forbid his execution. He supported this claim with affidavits tending to show that his now-dead brother, rather than he, had been the perpetrator of the crime. Petitioner urges us to hold that this showing of innocence entitles him to relief in this Federal habeas proceeding. We hold that it does not.                    . . .

The cool economies of this Met staging, on the other hand, summon a kind of enameled gloom; the flow has been diffused, the temperatures lowered.   Fabrizio Melano's production, with sets by Ezio Frigerio, returned to the house on Monday night. Huge columns coated in glossy black swing back and forth over an equally dark set of steps. Close together, they hint at interiors. For the garden scene they sprout leafy branches at their top. The columns retreat to make way for the Gypsy encampment and its projected backgrounds of fat clouds and cold mountain faces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930127","headline":"Military Cites Wide Range of Reasons for Its Gay Ban","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/us/military-cites-wide-range-of-reasons-for-its-gay-ban.html","abstract":"  Raised in the privacy of a two-hour White House meeting and in public debate, the military's objections to homosexuals' serving openly in the armed services are many.

He has acted as his own general manager for football operations, and has run the college draft as well. But the issue flared after the 1991 season when he fired Mike Shanahan, his offensive coordinator, in a disagreement over how the offense should be run. Even though Reeves had hired Shanahan and given him the title, he didn't want him to have control.    The owner: Pat Bowlen was angered by the Shanahan move and insisted Shanahan stay. But Reeves, whose title was vice president/head coach, pointed to his contract. Bowlen had to back down and announced, \"By virtue of his contract, Dan has the right to hire and fire coaches.\" It was apparent to many people then that Bowlen was not going to allow either Reeves or that contract to remain in force.   Dealing with the superstar: In Denver, there has been only one: John Elway. His relationship with Reeves, although rocky, was successful: Elway, the nervous, impatient star, and Reeves, the organized, no-nonsense pedagogue.   Elway has denied, as did Bowlen, that he was responsible for Reeves's departure. A few weeks before Reeves was dismissed, Elway suggested publicly that the coach should delegate authority, that he had taken too much on himself. And Elway was known to object to Reeves's firing of Shanahan. Possible Problems Reeves Will Face in New York  Dealing with George Young and the owners: The owners won't interfere. Reeves can do all the talking he wants as far as the college draft and picking free agents. But he won't have the final say. That is George Young's call. Tom Boisture, the player personnel director, oversees the draft and will listen to Reeves. Reeves has told Young that he doesn't expect the sort of control he exercised in Denver. Still, how will he handle it if he doesn't get his way?   The media: On a typical Wednesday, Reeves will be faced by more print and electronic media types than he saw before any game in Denver, except for the conference championship. His Southern hospitality will be taxed, but he seems to be able to handle crowds now. After all, he has been to the Super Bowl.   Dealing with veterans: There are no prima donas on the Giants' offense, no one who is as dominant as Elway in Denver. Reeves will control the offense and its players. If he chooses Jeff Hostetler as his quarterback, which seems likely, he will find a performer who tends to whine if things don't go his way. But Hoss, with the mechanical skills to run a Reeves-type varied offense, will do his bidding. Lawrence Taylor? The most famous Giant on defense, if he decides to return, is unlikely to play the defining role he enjoyed throughout his career. Still, Reeves probably will incorporate Taylor's style into the new defensive schemes. It is hard to imagine Reeves losing control of the defense the way Ray Handley did.   Motivation: By becoming the coach, Reeves immediately brings more authority to the role than Handley. The Giants still like to think of themselves as the Super Bowl team, and in Reeves they have a coach who wears more Super Bowl rings than anyone else -- eight (two as the Cowboys' option halfback, three as a Cowboys' assistant, three as the Broncos' head coach).

The diagramed example was played in a rubber bridge game at TGR's Club in London, and the South player was Irving Rose, one of the world's most brilliant card players. After finding a spade fit his partner took a wild shot at six spades, thinking that his partner was likely to have an ace in a red suit. This is admittedly a difficult bidding situation, since Blackwood is of little value when holding a void suit. In experienced partnerships North's second bid should be a jump to four clubs, which is a splinter bid even though partner has bid the suit. North should then accept a sign-off in four spades, since it is probable that the partnership is missing two red aces, or one red ace and the spade queen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930128","headline":"Beijing Shuffles Military to Avert Power Struggle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/world/beijing-shuffles-military-to-avert-power-struggle.html","abstract":"  The Communist Party has completed a military shuffle that may be the most comprehensive in four decades, apparently in part to avert power struggles that could erupt after the death of the 88-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping.

But five months after classroom doors opened, and four years after groundbreaking, Stuyvesant's pool, theater and pedestrian bridge are still unfinished or unusable, and parents and staff members are voicing mounting irritation over problems like the daily shutdowns of the school's escalators, the flaws in its air circulation system and the delays in turning on a satellite-to-classroom video system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930128","headline":"Study Shows Elevated Rates Of Two Cancers in Hamlet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/28/nyregion/study-shows-elevated-rates-of-two-cancers-in-hamlet.html","abstract":"  This wooded hamlet in northern Westchester County, its more isolated roads dotted with million-dollar houses, is the home of some of the nation's most prominent executives and their families, as well as the world headquarters of the International Business Machines Corporation.   It is a place where affluence has provided a buffer of security. That is why the talk on Main Street this week -- about reports of elevated cancer rates -- has been so startling to residents, even though state and county health officials have emphasized that there is no reason for alarm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930128","headline":"Condoms Reduce, but Don't Eliminate, the Risk of
