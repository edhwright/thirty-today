Many such ceremonies were performed before 1992, according to Rabbi Irving Koslowe, president of the American Jewish Correctional Chaplains Association.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931228","headline":"Neediest Cases Helping To Tighten Family Ties","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/28/nyregion/neediest-cases-helping-to-tighten-family-ties.html","abstract":"  When Shirley Pruitt was promoted from a job in the city's Parking Violations Bureau to a better position in the payroll office of the Department of Transportation, she was elated.

After its first three years, the project is still firmly on track, its leaders say. But that is not to say the road ahead looks easy. With 12 years left and only a couple of million nucleotides deciphered so far, the project's goal strikes some critics as an inflated promise. \n\nRecently, however, a scientist in Britain proposed a short cut that would use the genome of the fugu, a pufferfish known as a dangerous delicacy among Japanese sushi eaters, to speed the search for human genes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931228","headline":"Germany's Top Rightist Looks Ahead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/28/world/germany-s-top-rightist-looks-ahead.html","abstract":"  For many Germans, the specter of a right-wing rampage that haunts their country is personified by Franz Schonhuber, a 69-year-old former Waffen SS volunteer who heads the 23,000-member Republican Party.

D. Q. Bach's newly discovered and unfortunately remembered works have become more and more grand in scope. On Monday night in Carnegie Hall, Mr. Schickele (a k a Professor Schickele) sampled works from each part of that justly neglected composer's life: the Initial Plunge Period, the Soused or \"Brown Bag\" Period (\"more like a coma than a period\") and the Contrition Period (\"By then it was too late\").    By now too, Mr. Schickele, who moonlights as a \"musicolological\" professor at \"the U. of S.N.D. at H.\" (the University of Southern North Dakota at Hoople), has an almost magisterial perspective on the life of his sorry specialty. He is able to learnedly digress on everything from P. D. Q.'s technique of \"unintentional modulation\" (in which the composer \"accidentally\" slips from one key to another) to the origins of his habitual quotation of works by his betters (\"P. D. Q. Bach was the only major composer who worked on tracing paper\").","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931229","headline":"Budget Items Are Vetoed By O'Rourke","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/nyregion/budget-items-are-vetoed-by-o-rourke.html","abstract":"  In a continuing battle with the county legislature, the Westchester County Executive, Andrew O'Rourke, has vetoed many of the programs that legislators added to his proposed 1994 budget last week.
