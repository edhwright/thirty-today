As music director, Mr. Masur has thrown open the orchestra's doors for public discussions, open rehearsals and radio broadcasts. Ms. Borda, the executive director, has tried to lure untapped audiences by scheduling cheaper, shorter concerts at unusual times and festivals to highlight specific themes in music. Together, they have mended ties with a fractious, once-demoralized orchestra, winning critical acclaim for restoring its musical excellence.   Despite this string of successes, however, the Philharmonic has yet to shake the fiscal demons that have been haunting it, and other orchestras, in recent years. A deficit that first surfaced in 1990 will not disappear this year, as predicted. Rather, after dipping to $500,000, it is expected to surge past the $1 million mark again next year, suggesting that for all the cushions of a healthy endowment and well-placed friends, New York's premier orchestra is not immune to the trials confronting orchestras across America, and must invent new strategies for survival.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940630","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/style/chronicle-539546.html","abstract":"  What was the PRINCESS OF WALES doing last night while her estranged husband, PRINCE CHARLES, was on television confessing his marital infidelity during a lengthy interview?

After a brief flirtation with power in 1948, it settled into place as the permanent opposition party and seemed to take pride in the fact that it stood by its principles -- ardent pacifism, workers' rights, anti-Americanism -- rather than fighting for power.   As years passed, the Socialists exerted almost no influence over the conservative, increasingly corrupt power structure, and it has suffered its own corruption scandals. But the party remained the second-largest in Parliament, and its position struck a resonant chord with many Japanese. Most people regarded the Socialists as unsuited to govern but a useful check against the Liberal Democrats.  A Setback for Anti-Americanism    Never was this moral stance more in evidence than in 1960, when rioting broke out among Japanese who opposed extending the postwar security treaty with the United States.

Writing for a 6-to-3 majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist provided a model for judges trying to preserve the rights of a clinic's patients and staff to go about their business, unimpeded. He did so without disturbing the free speech rights of abortion opponents who are content to wage their protests peacefully.         The Chief Justice, who has long been personally opposed to abortion rights, nevertheless had no trouble drawing the line against illegal interference with those rights. He upheld key parts of a lower court injunction against protesters who intimidated and threatened a clinic in Melbourne, Fla. That included approving a 36-foot buffer zone to let patients and staff move in and out of the clinic freely. But Chief Justice Rehnquist struck down stricter restraints, including a ban on protesters' trying to speak to patients within 300 feet of the clinic, as excessively curbing rights of free speech.

First comes the smell of burning wood, as enticing as a crackling campfire in the woods, from the igloo-shaped oven in one corner of the sedate, squarish dining room. Then comes the yeasty smell of Tuscan bread, so alluring with its irregular crust that the urge to press a slice to your nose and inhale  is irresistible. And then comes the smell of fresh herbs, of basil, mint and rosemary, of just-roasted peppers, of tomatoes and of grilled meats.         The woody smell certainly makes sense at a place called Col Legno. The name means with wood, a musical term for playing a violin with the back of a bow. In  this case, the term refers to virtuosity of another sort. Almost everything except pasta, of course is cooked over wood. The result is simple, lusty yet delicate food invigorated by just a touch of wood, achieved by a chef who plays  the wood fire like a musical instrument.
