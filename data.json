But they did nothing to alert the Government of their apprehensions or to stop the launching of the most complex and costly scientific instrument ever put into space.   The Federal Government recently disclosed this and other new details of its three-year investigation into the causes of the mirror problem after the builders agreed to pay $25 million in damages. The mirror, made in the early 1980's, has a symmetrical distortion known as spherical aberration, which throws off the Hubble's focus so that starlight, instead of falling at one point within the telescope, is spread over an area. The current space shuttle mission is to repair that flaw.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931207","headline":"Rockies Sign Galarraga To a Four-Year Contract","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/07/sports/sports-people-baseball-rockies-sign-galarraga-to-a-four-year-contract.html","abstract":"  The Colorado Rockies and first baseman ANDRES GALARRAGA agreed yesterday on a guaranteed contract that will keep the National League batting champion in Colorado for the next four seasons.

Mr. Luvisi offered the dignity and rectitude that make him such a satisfying chamber player.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19931207","headline":"Long Island Rail Road shooting: Passenger Colin Ferguson murders six people and injures 19 others on the LIRR in Nassau County, New York.","pages":[{"title":"1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Long_Island_Rail_Road_shooting","description":"Shooting in a train in Garden City, New York, US","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Merillon_Avenue_Station_looking_east.JPG/320px-Merillon_Avenue_Station_looking_east.JPG","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":240},"abstract":"On December 7, 1993, a mass shooting occurred aboard a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) train in Garden City Park, New York.

At any point in one of her works -- and certainly in those she presented on Saturday evening at Merkin Concert Hall -- a listener can find something familiar, drawn from the stew pot of post-1965 avant-garde styles. But the juxtapositions of these elements, and the uses to which they are put, are peculiar to Ms. Monk. A vocal warble in the style of early Yoko Ono is set against a Philip Glass-style chord progression played on a reedy keyboard; a spiky Steve Reich rhythmic figure propels vocal counterpoint and animal noises. The influences may be easily catalogued, but Ms. Monk's signature is always clear.    Ms. Monk opened her concert with glimpses of \"Vessel\" (1971), a sprawling multi-media work originally performed by a cast of 150. In the excerpts she offered at Merkin Hall, Ms. Monk played keyboards and sang, and was joined by two singers, Allison Easter and Dina Emerson. If the selections scarcely suggested the spirit of the full work, they gave a fair overview of the colorful vocal techniques Ms. Monk employs, and her way of using them to enliven and disguise the harmonic modesty of her material.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931208","headline":"Iran Wants to Assassinate Me.

Ranked 22d and unseeded, Ferreira broke Becker once in each set to win, 7-5, 6-4, in 1 hour 37 minutes in Munich, Germany. The seventh-seeded Becker's ground strokes lacked consistency and confidence, his volleys were erratic and his 13 aces were nearly erased by 10 double-faults. Two straight double-faults by Becker gave Ferreira a key break in the 11th game. Becker also announced that Eric Jelen, a longtime friend who became his sixth coach less than six months ago, had decided to end the partnership. Becker has now gone through four coaches in nearly three years. (AP) N.F.L.  Johnson Cites a Weakness: Coaching  A grim Jimmy Johnson has decided that one of the main problems with the Dallas Cowboys is coaching. Johnson came to that conclusion yesterday, the day after the Cowboys struggled to a 23-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in Irving, Tex. The victory kept them a game behind the National Football Conference East-leading Giants with an 8-4 record. \"It's not the effort and the talent of the players,\" Johnson said. \"We've got to do a better job of coaching. It took a 172-yard rushing effort from Emmitt Smith to save the Cowboys against the Eagles.\" (AP) FIGURE SKATING  N.H.L.  Verbeek Scores 3 to Lead Whalers  Pat Verbeek had three goals and Sean Burke enjoyed a successful return to the goal as the streaking Whalers beat the Washington Capitals, 6-1, in Landover, Md., last night. Verbeek scored twice and Geoff Sanderson added his 18th goal in the first period to help Hartford take a 3-0 lead. That proved to be more than enough offense for Burke, who stopped 30 shots in his first start since Oct. 27. The Whalers led, 6-0, after two periods. Hartford is 5-2 in its last seven games after a 4-14-2 start. Burke, plagued by hamstring problems, was playing in only his third game of the season. (AP) Blues 3, Blackhawks 2: Curtis Joseph had another oustanding game in goal for host St. Louis, making 37 saves. The Blues were outshot by 39-18 but had the trump card in Joseph. Last season he faced 2,202 shots, more than any goaltender since the league began keeping that statistic in 1982-83, and his shots-per-game average of 34 is above last year's figure of 32.4. (AP) Flames 4, Nordiques 4: Gary Roberts scored his second goal of the game with 2:12 left in regulation, giving Calgary the tie. Rookie Iain Fraser had a pair of first-period goals and Valery Kamensky snapped a tie 1:59 into the third period for the Nordiques. (AP) Panthers 3, Mighty Ducks 2: Scott Mellanby and Jesse Belanger scored less than three and a half minutes apart in the first period as Florida beat host Anaheim in the first meeting between the expansion teams. The Ducks lost for the fifth time in six games since their four-game winning streak through Canada and have dropped all seven games they have played against teams that entered the league after the 1990-91 season. The Ducks also lost leading scorer Anatoli Semenov with a dislocated left elbow. (AP) Lightning 3, Sharks 1: Brian Bradley's power-play goal capped a three-goal burst in the first period and Tampa Bay racked up a third straight road victory by beating San Jose.

It is a reputation that has grown steadily over the last 10 years without the assistance of hype, packaging or promotion. Two years ago, when I last heard him play, there was no ambiguity: he had clearly developed into a distinguished successor to Artur Schnabel.   Like that earlier pianistic master, Mr. Goode devotes himself to music greater than it can be played, most notably to Schubert and Beethoven; like Schnabel, too, he is first a musician and second a pianist. Mr. Goode has a limpid, reflective style that does not shy from technical and emotional risks. And he has a sense of structure that makes even the most eccentric and challenging scores seem like novels in sound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931208","headline":"5 Research Teams to Hunt for New Drugs in Nature, Gently","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/08/us/5-research-teams-to-hunt-for-new-drugs-in-nature-gently.html","abstract":"  The Government today announced the first awards under a program to find and produce new drugs from plants and animals in the developing world while preserving endangered species.

Injuries have ranged from corneal abrasions, chemical burns and minor hemorrhages that temporarily impair vision to retinal tears and detachments that can lead to permanent visual loss.

At CBGB on Thursday night, Mark Hennessy sang his lyrics in a deep, bleak baritone growl; Grant Fitch on guitar, Charles Bryan on bass and Peter Fitch on drums blasted out belligerent, bulldozing riffs. But while Paw's songs often start out thrashing, they don't stay that way; heavy-metal verses give way to choruses and bridges that ease back into folk-rock and sometimes hint at country-rock. Often, Paw (which comes from Lawrence, Kan.) does what might be called a reverse Nirvana; where Nirvana's songs often start out quietly and break into a roar, Paw's songs move from metal to melody. The music's colliding styles match shifting emotions in the lyrics. On Paw's album, \"Dragline\" (A & M Records), Mr. Hennessy sings about anger and trust, about breaking connections and trying to save them, about the inevitability of death. In \"Jessie,\" the singer is trying to run away from home, but his dog follows him; in \"Lolita,\" a father romances and denounces the daughter he has abused. \"Sleeping Bag\" juxtaposes an attempted suicide and an auto accident; in \"Pansy,\" an old man howls, \"I just want to lay down long enough to die!\" Mr. Hennessy's conviction, and his ability to distill situations into terse, allusive lyrics, make him a rival of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. And Paw's music, unsettled but carefully shaped, suits a band that distrusts its only inheritance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931208","headline":"COLLEGE HOCKEY REPORT","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/08/sports/college-hockey-report.html","abstract":"  Massachusetts-Amherst    Fiscal restraint rather than expansion has been the theme of intercollegiate athletics during the 1990's.

The United States is currently the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made contributor to global warming. But rapid economic growth and heavy reliance on dirty fuel may soon propel China toward that unenviable distinction.   China's pell-mell industrialization is powered largely by huge reserves of coal, the dirtiest of fuels in carbon emissions. Three-quarters of China's energy needs, from factories to home heating, are now met by burning coal. The result is all too palpable, as I found on a visit to several provinces late this summer. Noxious fumes sting the eyes of city dwellers, haze obscures the views, and acid rain falls as far as Japan in one direction and southwest China in another.

Also racism of Attorney Ms. Abramson of the law firm of Gaffin & Mayo on Broadway in Manhattan.                    . . .         Reasons for this: Adelphi University's racism, the EEOC's racism, workers' compensation's racism, NYC transit police, NYC police, the racism of Gov.

Those filthy swine that live at 226 Martense Street, Bklyn, are not my friends. Once they hear of this, they will loot all the evidence in my room, such as documents and tapes. I hate them with a passion.  FROM LETTER  TO COMMISSIONER KELLY  Dear Sir:   Please be advised that Mr. Colin Ferguson has contacted us, his close friends in the \"black\" professional community, to advise and assist him regarding his numerous requests for the immediate return of all documents, records, photographs, fingerprints, and negatives, related to his racist and false arrest of Feb. 17, 1992. This, of course, constituted the first arrest of Mr. Ferguson's life.   A review of the documents in our possession revealed the racism and corruption within your agency, as you attempt to deny Mr. Ferguson the fundamental guarantees provided for under our system. . . .    The above mentioned arrest was particularly viscous and racist for the following reasons:   1) Mr. Ferguson had been sitting in the same well defined seat on the #1 train for eight (8) or more stops before his racist caucasian accuser and her racist caucasion female friend boarded the train demanding that Mr. Ferguson move over.   2) The accuser was not denied a seat, since she did sit down. She knew that the row of seats on that train does not accommodate its capacity comfortably, especially in the winter when commuters overdress.   3) The two racist caucasian police officers pushed Mr. Ferguson to the platform violently where he sustained shock and bruises.   4) A caucasian man with a pitbull on the subway platform impersonating a police officer had his dog jump on Mr. Ferguson's chest. He was allowed to go free although thirty or more commuters demanded that he be arrested.   5) The twelve (12) caucasian police officers refused to take the names of the fifteen (15) or so witnesses who came forward for Mr. Ferguson.   6) The N.Y.C. Transit Police has consistently engaged in a racist campaign of targeting \"blacks\" using the subway system in an effort to improve arrest statistics within the subway, which is then publicized with the hope that more caucasians will utilize the subway system.   7) Copies of Mr. Ferguson's photographs were given to his accuser and her friend by the police officers so that in the event the matter went to trial, the accusers could circulate the photographs to friends, thereby accumulating false witnesses to lie under oath and perhaps for future frame ups.   It should be noted that we have experienced the unpleasant duty of conferencing this matter with a deeply concerned young man, whose attempt to overcome dismay appears frustrated by a course of action calculated to disrupt his life, lend to the furtherance of slander, and libel and effect a future frame up. . . .   We hope that your office recognizes that Mr. Ferguson's ability to proceed with his normal day to day activities have been tremendously affected. . . .   Yours truly, Approved and accepted by: Colin Ferguson","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931209","headline":"Blaming the Victims : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/09/opinion/IHT-blaming-the-victims-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Many Muslim women in the former Yugoslavia live in fear of being called upon to testify at the United Nations war crimes trials in The Hague.

Each had collapsed while playing basketball -- Gathers in a game three years ago for Loyola-Marymount University of Los Angeles, Marable while participating in tryouts for his high school team, William Penn.   A mound of dirt under the maroon canopy at Mount Lawn now awaited the funeral cortege -- and Joseph Marable's coffin. Young Joe, or Joe-Joe, as some called him, or Muddy, another nickname because he frequently got dirty as a child, or Doc, as some basketball-playing friends referred to him because of his hook shot that was said to resemble Dr. J's, died last Tuesday.
