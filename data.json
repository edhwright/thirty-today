For one thing, the lag between a politician's moment in history and the subsequent book is often ample for the public to forget the person or lose interest. For another, publishers are so susceptible to famous people -- even if the people are famous simply because they did some relatively minor thing during some administration or other -- that they often pay too high an advance, print too many copies and end up with too many unsold books. \"It is indeed a tough judgment call, and we've all made mistakes,\" said Caroline K. Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division.    But this month, publishers who bet lots of money on books by politicians have good reason to be pleased with themselves. In a curious confluence of events, three political books are enjoying long runs on the nonfiction best-seller lists. These are \"Standing Firm\" (HarperCollins/Zondervan), by Dan Quayle; \"Beyond Peace\" (Random House), by Richard Nixon, and \"The Haldeman Diaries\" (Putnam), by H. R. Haldeman. \"All these books are selling much better than we expected,\" said Susie Russenberger, director of trade books at Ingram, a book wholesaler. The company, she said, has sold 21,000 copies of Mr. Quayle's book, 22,000 of Mr. Nixon's, and 11,000 of Mr. Haldeman's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940622","headline":"Barge Pilot Blamed in Fatal Amtrak Wreck","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/22/us/barge-pilot-blamed-in-fatal-amtrak-wreck.html","abstract":"  Federal officials today blamed a poorly trained barge pilot for the worst train wreck in Amtrak's history, saying he rammed a train bridge in a pre-dawn fog moments before the 11-car Sunset Limited, en route from Los Angeles to Miami, began to cross the span.

Facing a huge prospective deficit in the year that starts July 1, he set a few critical priorities and stood firm: Hold the line on total spending. Shave taxes. And slash the city payroll while preserving the police and fire departments' budgets and funds for classroom teachers. By fencing off those three categories -- half of all city personnel -- he forced deeper cuts in almost everything else.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940623","headline":"Watts in Benefit Recital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/arts/watts-in-benefit-recital.html","abstract":"  The pianist Andre Watts is to give a recital on July 3 at 4 P.M. at the Tannery in Mount Lebanon Shaker Village in New Lebanon, N.Y.

With the many visitors in New York commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, which helped begin the gay rights movement, Lesbopalooza's organizers had a wide-ranging, multinational cast of bands to choose from.

The atmosphere would be genial and festive, with dinner on the lawn before the opera. The repertory would draw heavily on contemporary works and neglected 18th- and 19th-century scores, with familiar works as the icing rather than the cake. The operas would be sung in English, mostly by young Americans. And the house -- the 950-seat Loretto-Hilton Center -- would be intimate enough for the singers to be heard and understood without forcing.   In 19 seasons, the company's budget has grown to nearly $5 million from $139,000, and the number of performances has grown to 30 from 13. Nine years ago, Mr. Gaddes handed the reigns to Charles MacKay, the general manager, and Colin Graham, the artistic director, and although they clearly have their own ideas about opera presentation, they have largely upheld Mr. Gaddes's original vision.

So there's the inevitable point, befitting a performance where the star wears pajamas, when her eyelids grow leaden and her head so heavy that she bumps it against a lamp. She wakens to recall a childhood dream that was so realistic it influenced her behavior in school the next day; its unfortunate consequences will be familiar to anyone who remembers the social mores of second-grade friendships.   The fact that any performance -- and life itself -- is a minefield of potential embarrassments provides both the form and content of this blissful piece of theater of abashment. The show \"101 Humiliating Stories\" (there are only 17, actually, but each has numerous subsets) is a chain of artfully paced narratives of excruciating moments recollected in, well, not exactly tranquillity, but with the modulated control of a master comic eternally poised between ingenuousness and irony.   Ms. Kron, who is a member of the theater troupe Five Lesbian Brothers, combines a novelist's sense of the telling social detail with a Chaplinesque knowledge of the humor in the yawning gap between intention and action (or, as she puts it, between the self you see in your mirror at home and the one that leaps out at you from store windows). She realizes, as she tells us, brushing a sheaf of papers to the floor, that there's \"a second set of behaviors that I exhibit to people that I am not aware of.\"   This premise infuses autobiographical tales that cover all manner of faux pas: stories of hair caught in school-bus doors; of \"geeky celebrity encounters\"; of fainting in the corridors of a Michigan junior high school in a green-and-white polyester gym suit; of speculating, with wicked specificity, on the horrific events that must have led to the abandonment of a sanitary napkin spotted near the entrance of the same institution and of walking down the halls of a business office with a skirt tucked into a pair of pantyhose.   All of the anecdotes, in fact, are spiritually akin to the sorts of dreams in which you find yourself naked before a crowd. They are linked by a series of scenes in which Ms. Kron imagines herself addressing her Lansing, Mich., high school reunion, explaining -- in styles ranging from cringing to confrontational -- both her sexual and professional identities. No alternative, of course, is safe when you're standing behind a podium.   The show, which has been artfully staged by John Robert Hoffman and was first presented in a rougher form at the Serious Fun festival last summer, is part of the Gay Games and Cultural Festival. The question of how Ms. Kron presents herself as a lesbian to the world at large (and particularly to her former classmates) is a prime source of the social awkardness she describes. But \"101 Humiliating Stories,\" at the New York Theater Workshop through July 2, is really for anyone who has ever had cause to blush. 101 Humiliating Stories  Written and performed by Lisa Kron; directed by John Robert Hoffman; set by Amy Shock; costume by Jose Gutierrez and Chip White; production stage manager, Janet M.

The film, which opens the Joseph Papp Public Theater's 1994 Italian Summer Festival tonight at 8:05, is remarkably similar in look and pacing to the Broadway musical adaptation except for one crucial difference. The character of Fosca, the ugly, ailing woman who conceives an obsessive passion for Giorgio, a handsome 19th-century cavalry officer, was softened for the Broadway musical.   The difference between Valeria D'Obici's movie portrayal of Fosca and Donna Murphy's performance is the difference between commedia dell'arte and Chekhov, between Margaret Hamilton in \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Olivia de Havilland in \"The Heiress.\" The scenes in which Miss D'Obici's bony, hollow-eyed Fosca throws herself at Bernard Giraudeau's dashing Giorgio lend the film an undertone of gallows humor. The character is a leering, voracious symbol of death. Ms. Murphy's lush voice and air of mournful abjection, deepened by Mr. Sondheim's yearning music, makes Fosca seem more romantically tragic than scary. The two performances are equally powerful in their very different ways.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940624","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/24/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"-.

It is an anomalous bid, since it was France that originally armed and trained the very Hutu-led \"government\" militias that are credibly accused of slaughtering minority Tutsis. Though the U.S. delegate praised France's \"bold\" and \"noble offer,\" it has been generally opposed by human rights and humanitarian groups, and has been assailed by the rebel Patriotic Front, whose leaders are mostly Tutsis.    It is obviously risky for the Security Council to approve a peacekeeping force that is viewed as a mortal enemy by one side in the very war the U.N. is striving to end. France insists that its 2,500 or so troops will not occupy territory but will only try to save threatened civilians for a two-month interim period, then turn over peacekeeping tasks to an all-African force. But as the Somalia experience attests, \"humanitarian\" mandates tend to expand very rapidly, and to prevent another debacle France needs to be held to its word.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940624","headline":"Terry Murray Hired to Coach the Flyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/24/sports/sports-people-hockey-terry-murray-hired-to-coach-the-flyers.html","abstract":"  The Philadelphia Flyers yesterday named the former Washington Capitals coach and former Flyers defenseman TERRY MURRAY as the team's head coach.
