Senator Benton stood up, allegedly pulled open his shirt and cried out, \"Let the assassin fire!\" Cooler heads wrestled the gun from Senator Foote's hands and order was restored. \n\n     Clearly, Congress can be a tough place. Incidents of extreme behavior -- though, thankfully, not this extreme -- have taken place at moments of tension and change throughout American history. So the next time a moderate Congressman  calls it quits, complaining about the \"unprecedented\" incivility, frustration and polarized extremes on Capitol Hill today, we can take comfort in the historical record: it has always been like this, and this too shall pass.
