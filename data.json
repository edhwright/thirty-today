Chances are he will sit quietly by his locker nibbling on a Snickers bar, let the other guys do the talking, then go out and stampede for 150 yards.

And it is clear that Hampton, the heart and soul of New York's running game, has quietly become one of the team's most respected players. That might explain the bold prediction. Bold because many people expect the Giants to miss the playoffs because of the loss of so many key players, such as Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, and 75 percent of the starting secondary.

But this year, after an aggressive business lobbying campaign, the President junked his own solution and extended trade privileges unconditionally. Now it is up to Congress to try to repair the damage. It can begin by passing legislation that would re-link tariff rates for certain Chinese goods to minimum human rights standards.   The annual struggles over China's tariffs stem from the outrage many Americans felt when Deng Xiaoping ordered army tanks to mow down students demonstrating for democracy in Beijing's Tiananmen Square five years ago. But the issue is no longer just Tiananmen. That one barbaric act unmasked the true nature of a regime that was known abroad mainly for its economic reforms.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940728","headline":"For Rwandan Refugees, a Grim Routine of Death","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/world/for-rwandan-refugees-a-grim-routine-of-death.html","abstract":"  There is no \"Day in the Life of a Refugee Camp\" story.

But about 200 of the sect's disabled students are taught with public funds in a school that the State Legislature carved out as a special district in 1989. Hasidic families have thus been allowed to shelter their disabled children from the ridicule and hostility parents fear they would encounter in neighboring public schools because of their distinctive dress and membership in a reclusive community -- while still educating them with public funds.    How far should New York State go to accommodate this group? The U.S. Supreme Court says the state went too far by creating a special district to educate them. Now the Legislature and Gov. Mario Cuomo have approved a law that tries to get around the Court's objections. The new law faces another possible court challenge. But even if it does not violate constitutional barriers against state aid to religion, it represents bad policy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940728","headline":"Financing for Times Square Leads to Harsher Criticism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/nyregion/financing-for-times-square-leads-to-harsher-criticism.html","abstract":"  Less than a week before a critical deadline in the long-delayed plan to redevelop Times Square, a new report from one of the project's most prominent critics suggests that the deal for four huge office towers has created a financial quagmire that could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

Partly because the  festival has always offered these kinds of pairings, and partly because the programming often did not match the announced concept, this effort came in for some derision. So this year Lincoln Center dreamed up a few more focused themes, one of which -- Vienna, circa 1784 -- is being explored this week at Avery Fisher Hall. The final installments are tonight and tomorrow evening.         You may be wondering, what kind of theme is 1784? Good question. It was hardly a watershed, politically or musically. Mozart, then 28, was fairly prolific; when wasn't he? The works he composed that year were mature, certainly, and sometimes excitingly virtuosic, but they hardly have the depth of his works from, say, his final year, 1791.

The other miracle is that the two stars of \"It Could Happen to You\" keep it sailing over a script that is often as predictable and flat as the movie's new title.

He contends that the cuts were  part of his original plan and no one should be surprised. Leaving this double talk aside, he is moving in the right direction -- but still too slowly.         Two responsible monitors of the city's finances now say that, even counting the new cuts, the budget for the year that began July 1 is still far from balanced -- and that Mr. Giuliani has done too little to improve prospects for future years. In separate reports, State Comptroller Carl McCall and the staff of the Financial Control Board found gaps in the budget of at least $500 million   -- after allowing for the new round of cuts.
