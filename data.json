Oliver Koppell, the New York State Attorney General, has finally permitted the New-York Historical Society to sell about $20 million worth of art and objects from its collection. The proceeds are to go toward the museum's endowment, which covers some of its operating costs as well as the care of the society's art collection and library. But the sale, expected to take place at Sotheby's in New York early next year, will proceed in a highly unusual fashion.   In an attempt to raise the most money for the financially troubled institution while giving other New York State institutions a break, Sotheby's, the attorney general and the society have come up with what they are calling a \"pre-emption plan,\" whereby New York State museums, libraries and archives will have a right of first refusal to buy items at a discount, but only after the auction. Buyers will be informed before the sale that in fact, they may not be buying at all. If an institution decides it wants a work of art or an object that has been auctioned, that can in effect void the sale of that item to the private bidder.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940909","headline":"Seeking Justice in Cairo : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/opinion/IHT-seeking-justice-in-cairo-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The world community is about to put forward the novel proposal that the only solution to the rapid growth of the world's population is justice.

NEIL STRAUSS Still Improvising    Derek Bailey Quartet, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. In the 1980 book \"Improvisation,\" the guitarist Derek Bailey contends that improvisation is the most widely practiced musical activity, but the least acknowledged and understood. He ought to know. As a pick-up musician in the 1950's and a studio musician in the 1960's, he learned a lot about discipline and restriction before striking out on his own in search of freedom. Three decades later, he's still twisting his tuning pegs, whittling atonal guitar lines, and breaking for periods of silence. He has become one of the most technically adept performers in a genre that has pretty much remained unacknowledged and misunderstood. He performs with the saxophonist Peter Brotzmann, the drummer Gregg Bendian and the bassist Skuli Sverrisson tonight and tomorrow night at 10. Admission: $10. N.

Led by Ben Daughtrey, a reformed hardcore rock musician, Love Jones croons self-consciously slick retro-rock songs colored with light brush strokes of bossa nova, soul and doo-wop. The band sometimes tries too hard to imitate a style of music characterized by its effortlessness, but that's only part of its charm. Doors open at 8 P.M. admission is $8. N.

I've learned to savor the occasional joyous confluence of serendipity and skill, the moment when ball and bat meet with the resonant sound of an orchestral wood block. (O.K. It's tinnier when the bat is aluminum.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940909","headline":"Giuliani to Put Housing Police Under Bratton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/nyregion/giuliani-to-put-housing-police-under-bratton.html","abstract":"  Signaling his determination to move ahead with a merger of New York City's three police departments, Mayor Rudolph W.

The first Rodney King trial reminded the nation of all that can go wrong when all-white juries sit in judgment of black defendants or victims. And studies show that black jurors are less trusting than whites of police testimony and more apt to side with the defendant.

Although historical records show Christus was a successful and wealthy painter, admitted to the highest circles of society, quite soon after his death toward the end of the century his art was all but forgotten. In the 1820's he was rediscovered, only to be brushed aside in this century by art historians like Max Friedlander and Erwin Panofsky as a weak hanger-on of van Eyck. PETRUS CHRISTUS: Renaissance Master of Bruges (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $60) teases out the obviously derivative elements of Christus's small oeuvre from his perhaps minor but nonetheless significant contributions to Renaissance Flemish panel painting. As Maryan W. Ainsworth, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows in her scholarly essay, Christus married his intimate knowledge of illumination techniques to the new medium of oil painting. His often diminutive, richly detailed panels shimmer with color. Ms. Ainsworth's painstaking examination of the artist's technique, aided by scientific analyses of the underpaintings, quite conclusively distinguishes Christus's slightly dreamy artistic sensibility from that of the what-you-see-is-what-you-get realism of van Eyck. However, in her zeal to restore Christus's status as an original artist, the author sometimes glosses over his obvious deficiencies -- Christus's portraits (which, although expertly executed, do tend to look alike) are described as \"consistent in their physiognomy.\" However, while the book sometimes plunges the layman deep into the arcane world of art conservation with its abstruse terminology, it does succeed in bringing to life not just the work of Christus, but also his richly adorned (and beautifully painted) world of the 15th century's wealthy and devout.\nSIRI HUNTOON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"DRIVING SMART;\nCleaner Starts for the Catalytic Converter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/automobiles/driving-smart-cleaner-starts-for-the-catalytic-converter.html","abstract":"AUTOMOTIVE engineers have long known that cars do their most serious polluting right after they are started, before their catalytic converters warm up.\n\n\"Three-quarters of hydrocarbon emissions come out of the tailpipe in the first two minutes,\" says Joe Kubsh, an engineer in Novi, Mich., for W.

Suddenly the half-forgotten quiz show scandal has attracted the attention of two prominent American story-tellers: Robert Redford, who directed the film \"Quiz Show,\" opening this week, and Richard Greenberg, the playwright whose parallel drama, \"Night and Her Stars,\" is en route to the Manhattan Theater Club in New York.

This type of myopic point of view is the reason that the county's deteriorating bridge remains in service, and why safety problems at this intersection remain uncorrected.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"A Building Of Harmony","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/arts/l-brooklyn-law-school-a-building-of-harmony-192082.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I heartily disagree with Herbert Muschamp's critique of Robert A.

It took about two years before he was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. \n\nToday, Mr. Dystal, who is 48 years old and in a wheelchair, lives in Rye Brook near the Purchase home of his parents, Marion and Oscar Dystal. While his mind has remained sharp, he can only leave his home with the help of others. While his spirit is upbeat, his feelings of isolation are intense, says his father, a former chief executive officer and president of Bantam Books.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/books/in-short-nonfiction-192414.html","abstract":"  JOURNALISM  THE AIRPORT  Terminal Nights and Runway Days at John F.

Any team-based production (a film, electronic game, reference work or textbook, for instance) is far costlier to develop than the average book is to write. Book publishers whose primary income comes from games, textbooks and reference books might find new media of long-term interest, but others ought to remind themselves that complexity, subtlety, intellectual rigor and originality have a hard time clearing the economic hurdles of the marketplace -- if new media cost a lot to develop, each title will need a mass audience to make the undertaking viable.

He has only campaigned intensively for the last week or two, while running brief television spots about his accomplishments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"Krone's Generosity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/sports/l-krone-s-generosity-211826.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   On a cool afternoon at Saratoga, Julie Krone was walking slowly to the walking ring as she anticipated her next race.

But New Yorkers may be about to set a new record for low turnout on Tuesday when both the Republicans and the Democrats hold their primaries.   It was, after all, a miserably hot summer -- poison for campaigning. The Jewish holiday of Rosh ha-Shanah cut two days out of the already compressed post-Labor Day campaign week, when voters traditionally start to pay attention. And the leading candidates at the top of their tickets -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and State Senator George E. Pataki -- feel so sure of victory on Tuesday that they're already running against each other.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940911","headline":"'94 Federal Handbook","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/travel/travel-advisory-health-94-federal-handbook.html","abstract":"  The writing is clinical, straightforward and, well, a little dull.
