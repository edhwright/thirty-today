Wolford made $700,000 last year; Kelly makes $2.864 million a year.   Ralph Cindrich, Wolford's lawyer, negotiated a deal with the Colts over the weekend that included this clause tied to the team's record: He would be paid at least as much as the Colts' highest-paid offensive player.   Wolford then took that offer, which calls for Wolford to average $2.6 million a year over three years, and showed it to the Bills, who had seven days to match it. But the Bills' highest-paid player on offense happens to be Kelly, the quarterback hauling down an average of $2.9 million a year. Did this mean the Bills would, in order to match the Colts' deal, have to pay an offensive lineman as much as their star quarterback?   The league yesterday said no. Cindrich said yes.   The league's management council and the Players Association will fight it out before an arbitrator at a hearing tomorrow.   \"If this is disallowed, it's discrimination against offensive linemen,\" Cindrich said.   But that wasn't the only flurry of N.F.L. activity yesterday. In addition, the Cleveland Browns reunited those former University of Miami quarterback rivals, Bernie Kosar and Vinny Testaverde, by signing Testavarde as a backup for what the Browns described as a one-year deal plus an option year.   The 29-year-old Testaverde had wanted a $2 million-a-year deal. He is believed to have signed with the Browns for a base salary of about $1.4 million this year. The contract is heavily laced with options that could swell to more than $2 million.    Art Modell, the Browns' owner, said the team doesn't expect to move on Carl Banks, a linebacker who two years ago asked the Browns to make a deal for him with the Giants. Banks still expects to leave the Giants, and Alan Herman, his agent, said he expects at least one club to make an offer early next week. Since Banks is a transition player, the Giants would be entitled to match that offer and retain him. Coach Dan Reeves says the Giants will compete with any offer he receives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"For Yanks and Mets, a Day to Wince at Pitching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/sports/baseball-for-yanks-and-mets-a-day-to-wince-at-pitching.html","abstract":"  One day after the Yankees finally settled on their starting rotation, it was cast into potential doubt today when Melido Perez injured his left leg running to first base against the Atlanta Braves. The injury put Perez's opening day start against Cleveland on Monday in jeopardy.   With Pat Kelly on first base in the second inning, Perez bunted back to pitcher Greg Maddux and then suffered a moderately strained left hip flexor as he chugged to first base in an effort to prevent a double play. Since Atlanta of the National League was the home team in the game at Municipal Stadium in West Palm Beach, the pitcher was in the batting order instead of a designated hitter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"Review/Dance; 'Swan Lake' Retold With a New Dimension","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/arts/review-dance-swan-lake-retold-with-a-new-dimension.html","abstract":"  The continuing success story that is the San Francisco Ballet acquired another chapter on Tuesday night with the opening of the company's first season at the New York State Theater. The local premiere was Helgi Tomasson's \"Swan Lake,\" an altogether ingenious production, stunning in its surprising 18th-century French decor by the Danish designer Jens-Jacob Worsaae.   Above all, this staging by the San Francisco's troupe's artistic director is a showcase for the high style now representative of its classical dancing. To say his young corps de ballet does a nifty job in the all-important second act is an understatement.

The campaign appears to be aimed not only at the militant Islamic Group, but also at the established, officially tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, which says it does not sanction the use of force. But it was only under prodding by Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa that the Muslim Brotherhood today condemned attacks against tourists and Government officials. Police State or Civil Unrest?    The confrontation signals the administration's resolve to curtail or shut down any Muslim group that appears to be politically inclined. Egyptian officials say that one mistake made by the Government in Algeria, currently battling a powerful Islamic militant movement, was in permitting politically motivated Islamic groups to exist at all, even in the guise of charities or labor unions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"U.S. TO URGE ASIA TO BUILD SECURITY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/world/us-to-urge-asia-to-build-security.html","abstract":"  In a reversal of the Bush Administration policy that opposed steps by Southeast Asian countries to solve their regional security problems, the Clinton Administration will both encourage and take part in such efforts, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State-designate for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said today.

The Islamic Group then joined forces with the militant organization Holy War, which preached the violent overthrow of the state. When Holy War followers assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981 the Islamic Group simultaneously launched an uprising in Asyut.

Almost since Boris N. Yeltsin climbed atop a tank in 1991 and hastened the end of the Soviet Union, Western nations have been talking about sending money to help him create a democratic Russia. But in dollars and cents, the aid actually offered has never been as big as the talk. And the amount actually delivered has been even smaller.  A1  YELTSIN READY FOR SUMMIT TALKS  President Yeltsin will be attending his weekend summit talks with President Clinton in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a stronger position after his showdown with the Congress of People's Deputies, the Russian Foreign Minister said, adding that \"the situation is firmly under control.\" A11  HARSH EGYPTIAN CRACKDOWN  Frustrated by its inability to stop a rising tide of violence by Islamic militants, the Egyptian Government has unleashed its security forces in a blood-letting and wave of detentions not seen in Egypt since the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981.  A1  PEACE AND TERROR IN ISRAEL  News analysis: Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has repeatedly said since he took office last July that talking peace with the Arabs is one thing and fighting Arabs who shoot and stab Israelis is something else entirely. A month of violence, however, has brought the two issues into a closer relationship.  A3  U.S. SEEKS AID ON ABORTIONS  Reversing nearly a decade of official Government antipathy toward some international family-planning programs, the Clinton Administration has decided to ask Congress to renew support for two groups that have raised the ire of those opposed to abortion.

Unlike most other species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the owl covers a much larger geographic range, strectching from southern British Columbia, Canada, to Marin County, Calif.

In some ways this effect seems almost old-fashioned, as if Mr. Serra has created a contemporary version of a Greek temple or a Gothic cathedral.

For years, 57th Street has been a mecca not simply for fashion, but also for art and antiques. Now it seems that high-end fashion designers like Chanel have the financial muscle to ease out the antiques shops.   Take 15 East 57th Street, where James Robinson's windows have attracted passers-by with striking displays of silver and jewelry for 14 years. The building, filled with distinguished antiques dealers, has been something of an institution on 57th Street. It is also home to Israel Sack, the American antiques dealer; Doris Leslie Blau, who specializes in antique rugs, and James II, a shop for small, predominantly English decorative objects. But Malcolm Franklin, an English furniture dealer, moved out of the building in June, and last month so did Paul Vandekar, whose stock of antique ceramics at Earle D. Vandekar of Knightsbridge occupied the building's second floor for 13 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930402","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/arts/art-in-review-073193.html","abstract":"  George McNeil   New York Studio School  8 West Eighth Street  Greenwich Village  Through May 2    To say that George McNeil's art is spectacularly gaudy is genuinely to praise it, although the aggressiveness that he has long cultivated no doubt partly accounts for his limited public reputation.

Roosevelt into its place of honor at the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, which is in the Bronx. Nobody came by to mark the moment, though a student couple necking a few niches down between Daniel Webster and John Quincy Adams occasionally looked up.   Actually, Roosevelt was voted into the hall in 1973, four years before the last elections for membership into what was established in 1901 as America's Pantheon. For 60 years it was taken seriously, drawing tourists like an urban Mount Rushmore, and generating national news coverage and debate for its elections. Now, like Ozymandias, it has outlived its glory; its proverbial 15 minutes. An unattended shrine, it is less visited and much less known than the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown or similar parochial temples of homage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930403","headline":"Market Bears Growl That the End Is Nigh","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/03/your-money/IHT-market-bears-growl-that-the-end-is-nigh.html","abstract":"IT CAN be lonely waiting for chickens to come home to roost, all the more so when their time away from the coop stretches on past five years.

The spending limit on foster care, believed to be the first in the nation, was introduced last year to limit the total the state will pay for foster care to $406 million. It is being praised as an innovative approach to containing costs by the Cuomo administration, which has proposed extending the cap on costs to the State Division for Youth, whose clients are emotionally troubled and delinquent youngsters. Questions About Quality of Care    Suffolk County officials say that the savings are a sign of success, but child-welfare advocates say that limiting state financing for foster care can discourage counties from removing children from dangerous or neglectful homes. Of the $6 million in incentives the Cuomo administration will pay counties for containing costs last year, $2 million will go to Suffolk County, where the county's treatment of 10-year-old Katie Beers has prompted questions about the quality of child protective services.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930403","headline":"Olajuwon Is U.S. Citizen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/03/sports/sports-people-basketball-olajuwon-is-us-citizen.html","abstract":"  Rockets star HAKEEM OLAJUWON stopped off at Federal court in Houston on his way to the basketball court yesterday morning and was sworn in as a new United States citizen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930403","headline":"BRIEFCASE: Newsletter-Touted Stocks Perform Well, Survey Finds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/03/your-money/IHT-briefcase-newslettertouted-stocks-perform-well-survey-finds.html","abstract":"Do stocks recommended most by advisory services outperform the market?
