Mahler's First Symphony, in a touching, beautifully calculated performance led by Seiji Ozawa, showed itself a very human activity. Its bird calls are long and leisurely, syntheses of the human voice. Indeed, the piece is less about nature than about a man's response to it. It also speaks of a Romantic era in which people were still custodians of creation and its principal spokesmen.   Written in 1955, Messiaen's \"Oiseaux Exotiques\" came before the Mahler symphony on Friday's program but postdates it by 50 years. It is a creature of a different world. These are nature pictures that man merely observes. The orchestration is for piano, winds and percussion. There are no strings to purvey the peculiar human sensibility. The bird calls are shrilly accurate, or at least reasonable approximations. They are laid one over the other in a general forest din. There is no hand of man to arrange them into sonata form. The movement does not breathe; it is abstracted, unforgiving symmetry. It pays no heed to human needs at all.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940221","headline":"Did Anybody Check Out Economic Wisdom of Hiring Sliwa?; He Deserves the Job","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/opinion/l-did-anybody-check-out-economic-wisdom-of-hiring-sliwa-he-deserves-the-job-256412.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   It's puzzling to me why there is such a negative uproar in the potential hiring of Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, as host of a daily talk program on WNYC-AM (news article, Feb. 9).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940221","headline":"Winter Olympics: Sports of the Times; Comforting to Know Standards Still Exist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/sports/winter-olympics-sports-of-the-times-comforting-to-know-standards-still-exist.html","abstract":"  WELCOME to the Rink of Dreams.

But dozens of studies involving more than a million people have hailed such a drug. It is none other than ordinary aspirin, the standby for reducing pain, fever and inflammation.   The findings of recent studies strongly suggest that an aspirin a day -- or at least every other day -- may be better than an apple at keeping the doctor away. Aspirin, these studies indicate, can reduce a person's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke and of developing cancers of the colon and other digestive organs. It may also improve brain function in people with dementia who have suffered little strokes, ward off or reduce the severity of migraine headaches and help prevent hazardous high blood pressure in pregnant women. Also being studied are aspirin's possible roles in preventing cataracts and averting recurrences of gallstones.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940223","headline":"Greece Is Out of Order","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/opinion/IHT-greece-is-out-of-order.html","abstract":"There is something wrong with the Greek government's sense of logic.
