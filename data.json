But classical-music elitism was not yet the whipping boy it has lately become, and it was possible in those days to redefine a supposedly elitist repertory as revolutionary and egalitarian, by virtue of its one-player-to-a-part structure. The folksy charm of the society's founding director, Charles Wadsworth, gave this new populist image a push.

Dinkins kicked off the final full week of the mayoral campaign yesterday by attacking Rudolph W. Giuliani as a hard-core Republican who lacks compassion for the homeless and tolerance for New York's diversity.   Mr. Dinkins, who was joined at some events by senior Congressional Democrats from Washington, including the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, worked persistently at themes that he has refined in recent weeks -- and that mayoral aides say he is likely to invoke often during the coming week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931025","headline":"No Larger NATO Now","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/opinion/no-larger-nato-now.html","abstract":"  The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary want to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But the Clinton Administration is right to say no for now. The Administration is instead offering all the countries of the former Soviet empire closer ties to NATO and holding open the possibility of eventual membership without setting a timetable.    Eastern European countries understandably want the U.S. security guarantees that come with NATO membership. Historically caught between the competing ambitions of Russia and Germany, they have learned the hard lessons of relying on themselves alone or on unreliable allies like Britain and France in the 1930's. But the dangers they now face can be met without formally binding the U.S. to come to their defense.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931025","headline":"Tokyo Journal; What Great Grief Has Made the Empress Mute?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/world/tokyo-journal-what-great-grief-has-made-the-empress-mute.html","abstract":"  Even in a new age of openness for Japan, the subject is just too hot to touch, on television and in print.

The only confirmed report is that she cannot speak.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931025","headline":"Kara Unterberg, Roy Niederhoffer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/25/style/weddings-kara-unterberg-roy-niederhoffer.html","abstract":"  Kara Jan Unterberg, a daughter of Seymour and Cynthia Unterberg of Westbury, L.I., was married yesterday to Roy Gary Niederhoffer, a son of Elaine Niederhoffer of Great Neck, L.I., and the late Dr. Arthur Niederhoffer.

The movement of water through plants, it seemed, was simple: up into the roots and out through the leaves as vapor. But now they are discovering that plants are not the passive water vaporizers they had been thought to be. Instead, researchers have found an unsuspected detour in the routing of water. And this discovery may enhance the understanding not only of how plants interact with one another but how ecosystems function and even how climate can change.    It turns out that in the night, many plants pull water up from deep in the earth and, rather than holding on to it to pass through their leaves the next day, they flush it out through their shallow roots into the ground around them. Biologists say that plants ranging from sagebrush in the arid steppes of Utah to sugar maples in the rainy forests of upstate New York appear to be acting as subterranean watering systems, drenching the soil and their thirsty neighbors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931026","headline":"1943: Japanese Base Hit : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/opinion/IHT-1943-japanese-base-hit-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ALLIED HEADQUARTERS IN AUSTRALIA - [From our New York edition:] Allied heavy and medium bombers and fighters destroyed at least 123 enemy planes, and probably 188, in the air and on the ground during raids on Saturday [Oct. 23] and on Sunday on three aird","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931026","headline":"Judge Backs School Chief In Dispute With Parents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/judge-backs-school-chief-in-dispute-with-parents.html","abstract":"  Turning aside the arguments of parents who have occupied a Brooklyn elementary school to protest their treatment during the asbestos crisis, a State Supreme Court justice ruled yesterday that a local superintendent acted properly when he closed the crumbling building and transferred its students to nearby schools.

Shot from moving cars, these views of block after block of anonymous rectangular buildings evoke a joyless environment in which the imagination is systematically stifled and where people live in a state of chronic, low-grade depression.   The film depicts this society's grinding down of Daniel Brenner (Kurt Naumann), an idealistic architect in his late 30's. Daniel, like many others of his generation, is deeply frustrated by life under the Communists but somehow tolerates it. Hired to design a miniature city on the fringe of Berlin, he fools himself into thinking that he can counteract the prevailing gloom with a cheerier, more innovative approach. Working with a hand-picked team of friends who were classmates in architecture school, he comes up with a design that incorporates rooftop gardens and modern sculptures and that has architectural variety and generous breathing space.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19931027","headline":"Widerøe Flight 744 crashes near Overhalla, Norway, killing six people.","pages":[{"title":"Widerøe Flight 744","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wider%C3%B8e_Flight_744","description":"1993 aviation accident","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Wider%C3%B8e_Twin_Otter.jpg/320px-Wider%C3%B8e_Twin_Otter.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":213},"abstract":"Widerøe Flight 744, also known as the Namsos Accident, was a controlled flight into terrain of a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter during approach to Namsos Airport, Høknesøra in Norway.
