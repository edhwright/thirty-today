Now a U.N. tribunal has brought formal charges of genocide against the camp's commander, Zeljko Meakic, and accused 20 other Serbs of war crimes.    So far only one of the indicted Serbs is in custody. Others remain at large in Serbia or in Serb-held areas of Bosnia.

On an average evening, in a familiar mainstream work, extravagant sets do not eclipse the singers; instead, they compensate for flaws. Vocal lines may be fragile, characters may be insufficiently defined, there may even be signs of sclerotic acting, but the sets leave no doubt that this is an imposing universe where much is at stake.    That much was evident, in this case, in the heavy draperies, the gilded decorations, the weighty mirrors, the flickering gaslights and the velvet, burgundy costumes. This production is as overstuffed as its pillows and cushions, but on Monday night it was just as well. There were a few nicely turned-out phrases and even a bit of effective acting, but for the most part, memory and image, not sound, made this performance work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950215","headline":"They Aren't Dog's Best Friends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/15/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-they-aren-t-dog-s-best-friends.html","abstract":"  At first, the view from the bridgekeeper's booth Sunday looked like something out of a picture postcard: a bridge over the Delaware River and a winter sunset with a man, a boy and a dog in silhouette.

Neither conductor nor orchestra has achieved a consistently high level of musicianship, but both are capable of great things when the spirit moves them.   You could say they are made for each other, although just the opposite might be true. The Israel Philharmonic digs into the music with great enthusiasm, but it does not possess a polished or precisely unified sound; it needs the taskmasterly attentions of an orchestra builder. Mr. Mehta, as New York Philharmonic audiences know too well, is no orchestra builder.

In Massenet's 1881 opera, which was given a compelling performance by the Opera Orchestra of New York at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night, Salome is almost sweet, a young idealist with a weakness for cultic devotion. She is strong willed but hardly lustful; her lines soar with yearning for John the Baptist, but she could hardly be imagined serenading his severed head.   Massenet's third opera, though, is far from bloodless. It is muscular, sometimes intense, and was considered so incendiary by the Paris Opera that it wasn't performed there for 40 years. Instead, it made its way to Brussels and a successful French tour, where it still managed to upset ecclesiastical authorities who found contradictions with the teachings of the church.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950216","headline":"Jury Told Simpson Wasn't Suspect at First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/16/us/jury-told-simpson-wasn-t-suspect-at-first.html","abstract":"  A Los Angeles police detective testified today that O.

True, the vase paintings are linear compositions using a limited range of colors, and so are the modern drawings. But the concentric circles in the 1969 Louise Bourgeois have only a distant relation to the geometric decoration on a circular pyxis, or lidded box. The German art historian Alois Riegl may have argued for the priority of abstraction over realism in the evolution of the ornamental tendril; nonetheless, the loopy shapes in Brice Marden's etching \"After Botticelli 4\" don't look anything like the vine leaves on the nearby calyx-krater, or wine vessel. Nor do the leaves in the 1949 Matisse resemble those on the tiny cuplike skyphos next to it. (The owl on another skyphos does look a lot like the owls on Picasso's 1950-51 ceramics, but Picasso's ceramics are not in the show.)

Such classics as \"The Fox and the Raven\" and \"The Cricket and the Ant\" were our equivalents of Winnie the Pooh and Mother Goose: the earliest tales with which we were read to sleep, the first verses we read and recited in school. The obligation to memorize La Fontaine's poems, made all the more enticing by Grandville's illustrations of woodland creatures in hilariously formal antique garb, never lay heavily on us. It was, in fact, a source of constant delight because these fables embodied the rhetorical device to which children are most drawn: the attribution of human thought and discourse to members of the animal kingdom.   But La Fontaine's cautionary verses, the theme of a beautiful little show at the New York Public Library, stamped our consciousness far more deeply than Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail affected children of the English-speaking world. They were composed according to the central agenda of 17th-century French literature -- \"To Please and to Instruct\" -- and instruct they did, relentlessly. Continually cited in the classroom or at the family dinner table, they became a code of conduct, a delectably ironic secular catechism programmed toward character building and self-improvement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"The Fear of Growth : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/opinion/IHT-the-fear-of-growth-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Bravo for Guy Molyneux's thoughtful and provocative article (\"When Productivity Is Up but Pay Isn't, Democratic Civility Is Down,\" Opinion, Feb. 15).

This portrait of a society that has a legalized sex industry, total equality for homosexuals, an open but regulated sale of marijuana and apparently racial harmony has the sober plodding tone of an extended Chamber of Commerce advertisement.    Far from stimulating crime and unbridled hedonism, the film suggests, the Netherlands' liberal attitudes on sex, drugs, abortion, guns (they are forbidden) and capital punishment (there is none) reflect a national temperament that is sedate bordering on glum. A word that keeps cropping up in the scores of interviews with Dutch Government officials and scholars about the country's approach to issues of individual freedom is \"pragmatic.\" The Government doesn't think in terms of good and evil. One commentator equates the Dutch pragmatism about social problems and its building of dikes to hold off the sea: if the water can't be conquered, it must be controlled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"Home Video","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/arts/home-video-434495.html","abstract":"  'The Lion King' at Home     On March 3 Disney will release \"The Lion King,\" priced at $26.99.

Not Exactly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-pride-of-the-yankees-not-exactly.html","abstract":"  Who were these guys? Where had they come from? The answer, in Bill Henderson's case, was from a card buried in Rudy Santin's Rolodex.   Santin, the Yankees' Florida-based scout, pulled that card with Henderson's Miami phone number, and tried his luck at dial-a-catcher on Tuesday afternoon.   \"Been playing ball?\" Santin asked.   \"None at all, not for years,\" Henderson said. \"Sorry.\"   Nothing to be sorry about, Santin told him. And less than 48 hours later, Bill Henderson, whose last play was a home-plate collision six years ago, was pulling up his pin-striped pants one leg at a time, just like Joe D., Mickey and the Babe.   This little tale from the crypt once known as the Yankee clubhouse should give you an idea of what's going on here, at the start of replacement spring training, which is a joke, \"Star Search\" on Broadway. If the Yankees had this much trouble assembling pitchers and catchers, they may soon be picking position players out of the telephone book.   \"Some of these young men could earn positions in our organization,\" said George Steinbrenner, repeating the line the Yankees obviously fed their pitchers, catchers and dreamers. \"There might be some future star.\"   Now, there is only one, and he was not in uniform this morning. After more than two decades of trying, Steinbrenner is finally the biggest of all the New York Yankees. There is no one around who could possibly upstage the Boss.   That's why journalists grabbed hold of him the moment he hit the field, and Steinbrenner refused to let go. \"O.K, that's it,\" he would say after a while. Then he'd move a few feet, and start talking all over again.   His new sultans of swat would pass by, look up at him with reverence and gratitude. Fans pushed their paper and pens in his face and peppered him with questions and advice. George signed. George bantered. George leaned across the rail and planted a kiss on the cheek of a young girl. A guy who looked just like Don Mattingly -- honest -- told him the players would soon crawl back.   \"George, you've lost weight,\" an elderly gent told him.   That he had. A few more pounds, and he might have been out there, jogging alongside the nobodies in the most famous uniform in American sports. \"No, sir,\" Steinbrenner said to that proposition. He is the owner. The players are the players, even if they are not the players.   So who were these guys and where had they come from? Some were from the Yankees' minor leagues, in career atrophy, hoping to score organizational points. The others were the unremorseful has-beens we've been reading about these past few weeks, fantasy leaguers on leave from life.   \"I was between jobs,\" said Bill Henderson, holder of a marketing degree. \"My new job starts March 1. The boss said, 'Go for it.' \"   Henderson, 26, once went for the money, right out of high school, as the Detroit Tigers' 1987 first-round draft pick. Two years later, in the Florida State League, he was bowled over in a play at the plate, a season-ending injury that sent him back to school, for good.   At least he didn't sustain a concussion. \"He was out . . . I held on,\" Henderson recalled.   I'll admit that I'm breaking my personal oath to refrain from this \"I have a dream\" replacement material that strikes me, depending on the moment, as unpalatable or preposterous. Couldn't help it, especially after the way Henderson answered the question of how much he missed baseball after last summer's strike.   \"Actually,\" he said, \"I've always thought the baseball season was too long. By the time August comes around, I'm watching football.\"   How's that for expert commentary on the state of the national pastime? It might even have stopped Steinbrenner, as he blabbed on at the top dugout step, about how much baseball is \"interwoven into the American fabric,\" and how in small Indiana towns, men sit around all winter \"arguing who's better, Gehrig or Mattingly.\"   Meanwhile, journalists were so interested in the first workout of Steinbrenner's replacement Gehrigs that they surrounded the owner, pushing closer until one newspaper reporter, tired of being elbowed from behind, suddenly began landing punches to the head of a stunned magazine photographer.   The reporter was so quick with his right that Steinbrenner yelled out, \"Give that man a uniform!\"   For once, the reporter could compare himself to the athlete and know he had a better job.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/style/chronicle-544895.html","abstract":"  SHARON RICH, the author of three books about Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, will be making a pilgrimage to Washington next Friday on behalf of the two crooners, who appeared together in eight films.

When the American-born painter R. B. Kitaj's exhibition opened at the Tate last year, the reviews were so hostile that he announced he wouldn't show his work in England ever again. That was saying a lot for someone who had lived there more than half his life (he's 62), and who even coined the phrase \"School of London\" to describe the group of prominent painters that included himself, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. But Mr. Kitaj has always been a person to say what is on his mind, sometimes to his detriment.   Now that the retrospective is here you may well wonder what the fuss was about. If you go to the Met expecting another Freud exhibition, meaning one as galvanic and intense as the show of his work the museum had a year back, you'll be disappointed. This show has its inspired moments, though Mr. Kitaj is a painter whose ambitions outstrip his art. He deserves credit for those ambitions, and certainly not the caning he got in the British press. But his paintings can sometimes be abstruse and pretentious, and there are too many weak recent pictures on view to come out of the Metropolitan with more than mixed feelings. A Kitaj exhibition now at Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan includes some better new work that doesn't alter the bottom line.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950217","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/17/nyregion/no-headline-806995.html","abstract":"  \"We all just stopped and did a little praising God.\" DWAYNE CARR, after finding a baby who had survived a tornado in Alabama.
