And this discovery may enhance the understanding not only of how plants interact with one another but how ecosystems function and even how climate can change.    It turns out that in the night, many plants pull water up from deep in the earth and, rather than holding on to it to pass through their leaves the next day, they flush it out through their shallow roots into the ground around them.

observers have probably lost count of rock's psychedelic revivals. Since the punk-rock revolution, psychedelia has kept reappearing. Over the last decade it has taken forms from the whimsical rock songs of Julian Cope and Robyn Hitchcock to the long-winded jams of Blues Traveler and the Spin Doctors to the synthetic soundscapes of the Orb. Now the music provides a double escape: into druggy altered perceptions and often back to the fondly remembered 1960's.   Verve, an English band that performed on Friday night at Irving Plaza, makes its acid-rock revival an exercise in purism, harking back to Pink Floyd circa 1968. Nick McCabe played his guitar through reverb and echo devices that made the songs toll and ripple and ooze; the tempos were slow and somber. And Richard Ashcroft, looking every bit the psychedelic poster icon with his center-parted shoulder-length hair and rail-thin body, danced with bursts of manic energy and sang lines like, \"Hello, it's me, crying out, crying out, are you there?\" or \"No one cares, no one sees me.\" Now and then he allowed himself a falsetto whoop that suggested Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant. Behind the band, screens showed slides of things like faces, pyramids and handwritten lyrics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931027","headline":"Capitol Hill Memo; On Liberties and Libertines: Furor Over Packwood Diary","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/us/capitol-hill-memo-on-liberties-and-libertines-furor-over-packwood-diary.html","abstract":"  Every Tuesday, the Senate Democrats and Republicans talk about the great issues of the day in separate private policy luncheons.

Tonight's special hourlong season premiere at 8 (the regular time will be 8:30) wastes no time in fleeing the District of Columbia. John Hartman (John Ritter) and family are already on the road in a rickety van heading for the town where he grew up. He talks rhapsodically of common sense, decency and family values. He will soon know better. His new wife, Georgie (Markie Post), a Peabody Award-winning journalist, warily wonders if she's going to fit in on John's version of Walton Mountain. His two young sons from an earlier marriage are making no firm commitments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931027","headline":"Personal Health","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/health/personal-health-604093.html","abstract":"  ALL too often, women who complain of chronic debilitating symptoms for which doctors can find no physical cause or cure are dismissed as crackpots or hypochondriacs and are shunted off to psychotherapists for treatment of ailments assumed to be emotionally based.

I would like to send a few select members of the House of Representatives over there to take a look at what's happening. China's overwhelming infrastructure and industrial development ambitions are clearly beyond its pocketbook. Vast new projects, like Shanghai's huge new city complex of Pudong stand partly developed with most of the work being done by manual labor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931027","headline":"For Giuliani, an Unusual Opportunity to Change the Whole Face of City Hall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/nyregion/for-giuliani-an-unusual-opportunity-to-change-the-whole-face-of-city-hall.html","abstract":"  When Rudolph W. Giuliani speaks of how he would govern, he often refers to Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Depression-era fusion Republican who threw out the Democratic clubhouse and brought in as advisers an eclectic mix of Republicans, Socialists, New Dealers and even a vice president of Macy's.   And in many ways Mr. Giuliani could be just as free to cast a broad net as Mr. La Guardia was half a century ago. For if the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor surges to victory on Nov. 2, his election would mark the first time in two decades that Democrats had lost control of City Hall, giving Mr. Giuliani a rare opportunity to change the face of city government radically and to bring new people to the 1,500 jobs under the control of the Mayor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931027","headline":"Charlotte Is In, but Others Must Wait for Overtime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/sports/football-charlotte-is-in-but-others-must-wait-for-overtime.html","abstract":"  The National Football League, by unanimous vote of the owners of its 28 clubs, awarded a franchise tonight to Charlotte, N.C.

It has also made its way onto the pop charts, and has sold over half a million copies. But this piece and others by this Polish composer have not been a major presence on the concert scene until now.   On Sunday night at Merkin Concert Hall, the pianist David Arden presented the American premiere of Mr. Gorecki's First Piano Sonata along with his Four Preludes (Op. 1), which were written in the mid-1950's and are startlingly unmystical, containing robust toccatalike passages that recall Chopin's Scherzos or the music of Szymanowski.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931027","headline":"Islanders End Slump With a Scoring Flurry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/27/sports/hockey-islanders-end-slump-with-a-scoring-flurry.html","abstract":"  The Islanders burst out of their slump tonight and ended a five-game streak without winning with an impressive 7-0 thumping of the Los Angeles Kings at the Coliseum.

But for the moment, Mr. Dinkins is still standing and Mr. Giuliani still apparently striving to clinch his sale. That is an obvious testament to a month of relentless and often hyperbolic televised attacks by the Mayor painting his challenger as a big, bad Republican.

Shot from moving cars, these views of block after block of anonymous rectangular buildings evoke a joyless environment in which the imagination is systematically stifled and where people live in a state of chronic, low-grade depression.   The film depicts this society's grinding down of Daniel Brenner (Kurt Naumann), an idealistic architect in his late 30's. Daniel, like many others of his generation, is deeply frustrated by life under the Communists but somehow tolerates it. Hired to design a miniature city on the fringe of Berlin, he fools himself into thinking that he can counteract the prevailing gloom with a cheerier, more innovative approach. Working with a hand-picked team of friends who were classmates in architecture school, he comes up with a design that incorporates rooftop gardens and modern sculptures and that has architectural variety and generous breathing space.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19931027","headline":"Widerøe Flight 744 crashes near Overhalla, Norway, killing six people.","pages":[{"title":"Widerøe Flight 744","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wider%C3%B8e_Flight_744","description":"1993 aviation accident","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Wider%C3%B8e_Twin_Otter.jpg/320px-Wider%C3%B8e_Twin_Otter.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":213},"abstract":"Widerøe Flight 744, also known as the Namsos Accident, was a controlled flight into terrain of a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter during approach to Namsos Airport, Høknesøra in Norway.

It makes a real difference not only to Americans without insurance but also in containing the costs of health care. President Clinton knows that, and surely did not want to delay full coverage.

A series of hypothetical examples outline the current and projected costs of insurance coverage for a number of families or individuals in varying circumstances. Here are excerpts from the report, with White House's description and cost estimates. TWO-PARENT FAMILY YEARLY COST TO FAMILY NOW: Mary Sampson manages a small law office in San Jose, California. She makes $35,000 a year. Her husband, a minister, makes $30,000 a year. Today, they get their coverage through Mary's employer, who pays half their premium. They pay $2,940 a year, 8 percent of her salary, for their health care premiums alone, not including co-payments and deductibles. CLINTON PLAN: Assuming they choose an average-priced plan, the premium for Mary Sampson and her husband will be around $872 a year, or $73 a month. They could choose a higher cost plan, which would cost them more, or a 1ower cost plan, which would cost them less. COUPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW: Dennis and Barbara Rutherford, who live in Hannibal, Missouri have a combined income of $21,200. Dennis was laid off from his high paying job with a large manufacturing firm in late 1990. At that time, both Rutherfords lost their health care coverage. They have been turned down for other coverage because of preexisting conditions -- Dennis' high blood pressure and Barbara's history of breast cancer. Since then, they have been unable to afford the $9,000 a year ($750 a month) premium offered by the only plan that will accept   them.  CLINTON PLAN: If Dennis and Barbara enrolled in an average priced plan, they would pay 20 percent of the $3,865 annual premium for a couple -- $773 a year, or $64 a month.  SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Sara Bender, a 28-year-old broadcast journalist, lives in Columbus, Ohio, and makes $34,000 a year. Because she works for a firm which gets a lower cost premium for its healthy workers, she has been paying only $300 a year, or $25 a month for her health care coverage. CLINTON PLAN: If Sara enrolled in an average cost plan she would pay 20% of the $1,932 annual premium for a single policy -- $386 a year, or $32 a month. SINGLE PARENT WITH SICK CHILD NOW: Susan Addington is a single parent living in Virginia. She is self-employed with an income of $40,000 a year. Because her son has a serious chronic illness, she paid $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs and $5,000 in insurance premiums in just one year. Because she is selfemployed, she was only able to deduct 25% of her $5,000 premium or $1,250 of these costs. CLINTON PLAN: For the family share of her premium, for an average-priced plan, Susan will pay 20% of the $3,893 annual premium for a single parent family-- $779 a year. She will also pay the employer share for a single parent -- $2,479, for a total of $3,258-a-year or $272 a month. And she will be able to deduct 100 percent of the premium. PROFESSIONAL COUPLE NOW: Michael and Elizabeth Sands work and live in Memphis, Tennessee, and together earn almost $90,000 a year. Elizabeth is a graphic artist, making $40,000. Although Elizabeth's firm offers her health insurance, the couple chooses to receive their coverage through the architectural firm where Michael works, because it provides a more generous, comprehensive benefits package. Today the Sands pay $720 a year, or $60 a month, for this coverage. The total premium costs $4,400 a year, and the architecture firm pays the rest. CLINTON PLAN: The Sands want to stay with their current plan. Under reform, this plan will cost less than it does today because it wiII no longer pay for the uncompensated care delivered to the uninsured, saving 10 percent of the current premium cost. The average cost of a couple premium in the Sands' alliance is $3,865 but the Sands pick a plan that will cost $4,000. They will pay the dffference between 80 percent of the average cost plan, which is $3092, and $4,000, or $908 a year, $75 a month. LOW INCOME FAMILY NOW: Lars and Brenda Gustafson recently had a new baby, and Brenda resigned from her job shortly before the baby was born. Lars works for a messenger service in Minneapolis, Minnesota and takes home about $250 a week, or $13,000 a year. His employer does not offer him health insurance. As a result, he and his family have been uninsured for two years. CLINTON PLAN: Provided Lars and Brenda choose an average price plan, they will pay 20 percent of $4,360 or $872 for a two-parent family policy. But because Lars is in a two-parent family with income less than $14,781 a year, he is eligible for a discount, reducing his premium to $384 a year. FARMERS NOW: James Huggins, a self-employed family farmer in Kansas, makes $25,000 a year and has struggled to pay for health care coverage for himself, his wife and his 10-year-old son. He is only able to deduct one fourth of the $4,000 he pays in premiums each year. CLINTON PLAN: If James enrolls in an average cost plan, he will pay 20 percent of the $4,360 annual family premium or $872 a year. Like a business, James will also pay the employer share of his premium, which would normally be $2,479. However, that amount would exceed 7.9 percent of James' income, the limit on what employers are required to pay. Instead James will pay 7.9 percent of $25,000 or $1,975 for his employer share. James will pay a total of $2,847 a year, or $237 a month. For the first time, James Huggins will be also be able to deduct from taxable income the full cost of his health care premiums. -- Excerpts from HEALTH SECURITY: THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931028","headline":"Chretien Says He Wants Changes in Trade Accord","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/world/chretien-says-he-wants-changes-in-trade-accord.html","abstract":"  Fresh from the stunning triumph of his Liberal party in Canada's general elections, Prime Minister-designate Jean Chretien said today that he wants changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement and may not implement the pact without them.
