After eking out a victory in a raucous New Jersey gubernatorial race, Christine Todd Whitman might have expected a respite, a sweet and relaxed recess between the rigors of campaigning and the difficulties of governing.    But as innumerable headlines have reported, Mrs. Whitman's respite was barely a week old when her former chief strategist and campaign manager, Edward J. Rollins, shattered the peace by telling reporters that the campaign had paid off black ministers and Democratic Party workers to suppress the black vote. Fueled by angry black clergymen, finger-pointing Democrats and national attention, the furor raged on even after Mr. Rollins recanted, leaving Mrs. Whitman to cope with a scandal that threatened to maim her administration before it began.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931124","headline":"Reviews/Film: A Perfect World; Where Destiny Is Sad and Scars Never Heal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/arts/reviews-film-a-perfect-world-where-destiny-is-sad-and-scars-never-heal.html","abstract":"  In a perfect world, says one rueful character in Clint Eastwood's quietly devastating new film, the events that shape the story of Butch Haynes and Philip Perry wouldn't have to happen. But the world in which \"A Perfect World\" unfolds is a place of sad, ineradicable scars that shape their characters' destinies. Many of those scars have to do with the burdens and misapprehensions of manhood, as illustrated beautifully during the course of this eloquent road film and understood by Mr. Eastwood in subtle, profoundly moving ways. The time and place -- Texas, just before the Kennedy assassination -- tacitly heighten the film's sense of needless tragedy.   \"A Perfect World,\" a deeply felt, deceptively simple film that marks the high point of Mr. Eastwood's directing career thus far, could never be mistaken for a young man's movie. Nor could it pass for a reckless, action-packed tale of characters on the run. A lifetime's worth of experience colors the shifting relationship between Butch, superbly played by Kevin Costner with an unexpected toughness and passion, and Phillip (T. J. Lowther), the little boy who starts out as Butch's prisoner and winds up as his surrogate son.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931124","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/style/chronicle-117393.html","abstract":"  ORIBE CANALES, the hairdresser to stars and supermodels who is known simply as Oribe, has entered a drug rehabilitation center, his spokeswoman, Chen Sam said yesterday.

That tantalizing tidbit was then denied by another key player.   Mrs. Whitman insists the suppression never happened; she urges the Democrats to call off the dogs. Not yet, says Gov.

With Smashing Pumpkins (who opened a sold-out two-night stand at Roseland on Tuesday night), Pearl Jam and Nirvana, the Top 10 has been populated by rockers trying to exorcise troubled childhoods for themselves and their fans. \"What's a boy supposed to do?\" Billy Corgan sang in an anguished wail on Tuesday night. As the crowd sang along, he continued: \"The killer in me is the killer in you.\"    In their music, Smashing Pumpkins look back to the psychedelic late 1960's. The Chicago-based band has revived the viscous guitars and the stately, sometimes explosive drumming of groups like the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Pink Floyd. The music rushes out, a sonic avalanche of double-time drums and hard-riffing guitar, then suddenly pauses and floats, cymbals tapping lightly above a sustained chord.

Privately, Giants officials think there might be some minor disk irritation, something he has had before. If that is the case, Elliott's full recovery might take longer than expected. Standing Becomes Tough    When he was asked to go into detail about his back problems, Elliott said: \"I've got some things in there but I don't want to get into that. We'll wait and see.\" Elliott did acknowledge that it was tough for him to stand and watch on the sideline without feeling some stinging pain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931125","headline":"F.B.I.

The far-reaching inquiry, which has been under way for weeks but has remained largely unknown, centers on the operation at a remote ridge in August 1992 by the Hostage Rescue Team, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's unit trained to capture terrorists, hostage-takers and other violent criminals with minimal casualties. Fatal Confrontation    The rescue unit was sent to the Idaho mountain after a confrontation between the white separatist, Randall C. Weaver, and Federal marshals in which one Federal agent and Mr. Weaver's 14-year-old son were killed. The next day a sniper from the rescue team shot and killed Mr. Weaver's wife, Vicki, who was in the doorway of their cabin holding their 10-month old daughter. She was not considered a threat, and the F.B.I. later acknowledged that she had been shot by mistake. After a 10-day siege, Mr. Weaver surrendered.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931125","headline":"Nebraska Has Point To Prove To Polls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/25/sports/football-nebraska-has-point-to-prove-to-polls.html","abstract":"  They have a wealth of football history and tradition going back to 1912, but when Nebraska takes on Oklahoma for the 74th time tomorrow, it will be a meaningless game -- freighted with significance.

She is apparently further persuaded that Catholics for a Free Choice has as much right to speak \"for the church\" as the Catholic bishops. For her, speaking \"for the church\" seems to mean reflecting popular opinion, rather than faithfully interpreting the truth found in divine revelation and a proper understanding of natural law.

Public pleas to tone down society's violence, and the moral claim for slowing down the domestic small arms race, have overwhelmed a potent gun lobby that in the end went down with a whimper.    The National Rifle Association fully understood the consequences of this humiliating loss, its first Congressional defeat in a generation. That defeat means more than the Brady bill itself, which after all provides only a modest five-day waiting period so authorities can check for criminal records.

When the museum announced that it would begin collecting photographs, it did so on the strength of a 1992 gift, including both artworks and cash valued by the museum at $5 million, from the foundation the photographer set up a year before he died in 1989. The new gallery, on the fourth floor of the addition to the Guggenheim's familiar spiral building, is also named after Mapplethorpe.   To inaugurate the space, Germano Celant, the museum's curator of contemporary art, has selected 46 self-portraits from throughout Mapplethorpe's career. The show begins with his Polaroids from the early 1970's when, fresh out of art school, he began to explore photography. It concludes with his searing images from the late 80's, when he was afflicted with AIDS.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931126","headline":"LUTHERANS BALK ON A SEX POLICY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/us/lutherans-balk-on-a-sex-policy.html","abstract":"  A four-year effort by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America to write a statement on human sexuality has nearly foundered since reports of a first draft alarmed members of the 5.2 million-member denomination.    \"The proposed statement as written is mortally wounded,\" wrote the Rev.

They had left Vietnam on a small fishing boat, which lost its engine in a storm. They drifted for days until they made it to Malaysia -- swimming in at night to avoid patrol boats that had fired at them.

He announced that his trio -- with Dave Holland on bass and Gene Jackson on drums -- would play Cole Porter's \"I Love You,\" adding, \"You'll never recognize it.\" Beyond the first few melodic phrases, he was right; the tune slipped behind odd harmonies, dissolved into streams of single notes, fanned out into two-handed tremolo chords and dispensed salvos of dissonance. Afterward, a smiling Mr. Hancock played the tune slowly and explained what he had done: a key change here, and here, and again, turning Porter's harmonies into his own.    Mr. Hancock delights in transformations. He toys with rhythms, turning conventional off-beat chords into a game of syncopated hide-and-seek; he reworks harmonies, adding notes until the original implications are warped. He investigates silences and subtleties; he revels in high-speed runs and splashy, gospelly chords. His playing carries him to the hazy borderline between improvisations that can be explained by harmonic theory and those that are pure dramatic gesture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931126","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/26/arts/art-in-review-411493.html","abstract":"  Josef Sudek  'Poetic Images'   Sander Gallery  19 East 76th Street  Manhattan  Through Jan. 8    The atmosphere is palpable in Josef Sudek's misty, romantic photographs.

Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seeger, two folk music legends who have known each other for four decades and toured together on and off since 1975, will be joined by members of their families for two holiday concerts. Joining Mr. Guthrie are his son Abe (with his band Xavier) and Abe's daughters Cathy, Annie and Sarah. Mr. Seeger will be joined by his grandson, Tao Rodriguez Seeger. The two folk stars will perform highlights from their careers, including \"Amazing Grace,\" \"Wabash Cannonball\" and songs written by Tom Paxton, Leadbelly, Lee Hays and Harry Chapin, among others. Shows are at 8 tonight and tomorrow and ticket prices range from $16 to $26. STEPHEN HOLDEN Tribute to a Trio    \"Eddie, Bix and Bing,\" Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2272. Working in an informal round-robin style, the jazz guitarist Frank Vignola, the cornetist Peter Ecklund and the singer Eddie Byrd rekindle memories of Eddie Lang, Bix Beiderbecke and Bing Crosby. The appealing musical revue deftly sketches the pre-swing musical era when Paul Whiteman was considered the king of jazz, and the music is young, lilting and uncomplicated. Shows are at 9 and 11 tonight and tomorrow. Admission is $20, and there is a two-drink minimum. S. H.

History would have us believe that this has been a time of revolution: tonality overthrown, Romantic forms reduced to Classical ones, heart-on-sleeve effusion tempered to accommodate wit and discretion or else sarcasm and despair, even violence.   If Schmidt's Fourth Symphony -- which the New York Philharmonic under Franz Welser-Most brought to Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday night -- is to be believed, Wagner never died and the 20th century is only a postscript to the 19th.
