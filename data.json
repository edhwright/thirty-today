Moreover, it can reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to get off the hook with voters who do not share his opposition to capital punishment.   That said, Mr. Cuomo has beat such a hasty retreat that there is probably little harm done, except to the Governor's reputation for constancy. In fairness to him, the idea of a referendum is one that he has floated from time to time, but this time it came in the trappings of a legislative proposal.

So why all the worried faces? Why have some bleak forecasts cropped up? And why does a team that possessed the elite record in baseball two weeks ago suddenly seem vulnerable?   Blame it on the 10 lousy days before the break, the 10 days that nudged the Yankees from quality to somewhat questionable.   Perhaps the numerous injuries during the last month became too much of a burden. Perhaps the tantalizing thoughts of three straight days off after 36 games in 38 days had some Yankees thinking about fun and friends instead of first. Perhaps their four-and-a-half-game lead was only a mirage because this race was supposed to be tighter. Perhaps they skidded at an inopportune time and will regroup and rectify their plummet. Meaningful Games    But by losing 7 of their last 10 games, at Yankee Stadium and against teams from the supposedly inferior American League West, the Yankees have caused fresh doubts to be dumped upon their pursuit of post-season play. In a season when they are attempting to play meaningful games in October for the first time since 1981, the Yankees had four games chopped off their lead in 10 days and escaped to their homes with a one-half game advantage over the Baltimore Orioles. The race is on.   \"I thought,\" said Luis Polonia, \"we were going to run away with it.\"   Not so fast, Luis. While Manager Buck Showalter would categorize this losing as a \"perceived trend,\" the perceptions are that the Yankees will have some concerns when they initiate the second half of the season on Thursday in Seattle. Showalter has already wondered whether Don Mattingly (tendinitis right wrist) and Mike Gallego (strained calf muscle) will return promptly and effectively from injuries. And he will probably rely on 23-year-old Sterling Hitchcock in the rotation because 31-year-old Terry Mulholland's repertory has turned into Homers-R-Us for hitters.   There is also the need for Jimmy Key to continue dazzling, for the other starters to imitate Key on his worst day; for Danny Tartabull to start dazzling and for the bullpen to remain bearable. Showalter must instill in his players that they are still the finest team in the league, or at least the best in the division, despite the sputtering. Encouraging Sign    \"To realize we're capable of better and are still in first place is encouraging,\" said Showalter, after the Yankees reached the All-Star break with a 50-35 record. \"We still have to get even better as the season progresses.\"   When the Yankees stormed ahead of the pack to grab the top record in the majors for 26 days in May and June, with Paul O'Neill hitting over .400 and Key winning virtually every start, Showalter rarely smiled. He talked about challenges and winning every series because he did not want the Yankees to think their job was complete. Although Showalter does not think the Yankees relaxed with the decent lead, he admitted that having an edge allows teams to relax. He did not have to concede that the Yankees never boosted the lead from decent to devastating.   \"When you have a four and a half or three and a half game lead, you don't play with that sense of urgency,\" Showalter said. \"When you're behind, every game creates more tension as far as making every at-bat and every day count. You can't afford to fall back.\"   The urgency has returned. With a half-game lead, the Yankees will be studying the scoreboard to see how BAL is doing. Since they snatched first place by themselves on May 9 and stretched their lead to three and a half games by May 27, the Yankees had the opportunity to forge a sizable edge and make the other teams pursue the wild card berth. But now they are one defeat from having the fourth-best record in the league.   \"At that point, you would have said everybody was going to stay behind us,\" said Polonia, recalling when the Yankees were winning at a remarkable .700 percentage. \"But we lost a lot of games and Baltimore kept winning. You still have to think of the possibility of a wild card.\" Thoughts Are Urgent    O'Neill did not mention the wild card, but his thoughts were urgent.   \"I think there's an urgency anytime you are in position to win,\" he said. \"You don't know when you're going to be in that position again. When you're in first after the All-Star break, it's a clear chance.\"   Showalter added: \"I'd rather be controlling our own destiny. I know if we win, we don't have to worry about what they did.\"   How did the Yankees forfeit the chance to make it easier on themselves?    One answer is that until Melido Perez regained his form in the last month, Key was their only dependable starter. Another is that winning 7 out of every 10 games is nearly impossible. And let's not overlook the injuries that struck, as well as the loss of their touch at home; the Yankees have lost 14 of their last 22 games at Yankee Stadium. Over all, the Yankees dropped 20 of 37 games while limping to the break.   Still, Showalter hopes this team does not mimic the club that was tied for first place a major league record 18 days in 1993.   \"We hope,\" Showalter said, \"to make Baltimore, Detroit, Toronto and Boston feel like we did last year.\" A Lot of Ifs    If the starters are sturdy, the injuries heal, the Yankees regain their earlier form and there is no strike, the second half could still be joyous for them. Jim Abbott thinks it will be. Sitting at Fenway Park two weeks ago, Abbott surveyed the lineup and told himself he was part of a special team. He saw Key, Mattingly, Wade Boggs and O'Neill and thought about first and beyond.   \"It would be nice to do something with this group of guys,\" said Abbott, who figures to leave the Yankees as a free agent after the season.   \"I'm happy to be part of this team. I want to remember these times. I want to be a part of something with these guys.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940712","headline":"The Farrakhan Sideshow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/12/opinion/the-farrakhan-sideshow.html","abstract":"Fifty years ago, the civil rights movement battled the concrete ills of legal segregation.

It had become hard to define. Who could tell what distinguished the avant-garde from the merely idiosyncratic? Or from the just plain weird?   Now in its eighth season, the Serious Fun festival, which began last Wednesday and is to run through July 30, has spawned the sort of confusion that comes with growth and change. Critics say the whole thing has gotten too serious. Or maybe that it's too much fun. In any case, as Lincoln Center, with a new director of programming, Jane S. Moss, is mulling over a restructuring of all its special-performance series, no one seems entirely certain what Serious Fun is supposed to be. And though Ms. Moss said plans for next year's festival were under way, she acknowledged that performance-art programming under the Serious Fun rubric at Lincoln Center was not immune to change.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940713","headline":"At Issue: What Is Adequate for the Poor?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/nyregion/paying-for-new-jersey-s-schools-impact-issue-what-adequate-for-poor.html","abstract":"  With today's ruling, the New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed the state's duty to provide effective schooling, not just equal spending, for all students, especially those in struggling urban districts.

The players, who have made this work a specialty in recent years, did not bear down on the four notes with portentous solemnity. Instead, after two hours of exploring Bach's inventiveness and spiritual grandeur, in a work in which themes were expanded, contracted, turned upside down, combined with themselves and their variants in an encyclopedia of possibilities, the quartet played the theme with quiet, eloquent simplicity.   The tension immediately increased; it was as if a spring were being pulled back. Two themes had already been heard in the majestic fugue. But this third, signature theme, which has long been used as a tribute to the composer (in German, B is B-flat and H is B-natural), was clearly an announcement of something more sublime than had yet been achieved. A hint of what was to come was heard as the three themes intertwined, awaiting some sort of fulfillment. Then, without warning, the first violin fell mute, the second violin followed, as did the cello, and for brief moments there were only the eighth notes of the viola, which ended in silent space. That is where Bach is said to have left the manuscript at his death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940713","headline":"Cam's Card Shark 3-2 Choice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/sports/cam-s-card-shark-3-2-choice.html","abstract":"  Cam's Card Shark, the leading horse in harness racing who has dominated the 3-year-old division, was installed yesterday as the 3-2 morning-line favorite over nine rivals in Saturday night's $1 million Meadowlands Pace.

The dwindling and aging membership of Congregation Derech Emunoh somehow found the wherewithal to keep it open, cherishing the moments they could spend praying in the same pews that had supported their parents and grandparents.   But the determination of its 40 members came close to exhaustion yesterday morning when an early-morning fire destroyed much of the synagogue's ceiling and roof. Fire department officials said the two-alarm blaze was suspicious in origin, and because it involved a synagogue, the case was being investigated by the police as a possible bias incident.

So they should be. But in only 11 days, 10 young women have been the victims of sexual assaults or assault attempts in New York City pools. These incidents echo a nasty trend begun last summer with \"whirlpooling,\" in which groups of young males surrounded girls and young women, rhythmically clapping and intimidating them, then assaulting them.   Betsy Gotbaum, who was Parks Commissioner at that time, insensitively referred to those incidents as \"ordinary horseplay that got out of hand.\" Mr. Stern has shown that he is taking the problem more seriously. One idea he considered, but wisely rejected, was to segregate the sexes in the pools. Rather than deprive peaceful pool users of the pleasure of swimming with whomever they choose, he has opted to hold the thugs to civilized standards.

The woman, Dalida Velez, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic and the mother of six, was the latest victim in a series of deaths caused by unlicensed drivers this summer. She was dead on arrival at St. Barnabas Hospital. Earlier this month in the same borough, a 21-month-old girl was killed when an unlicensed driver backed into her outside a supermarket. Driver Is Charged    The driver in the accident yesterday at Crotona Park, Peter Henry, 27, was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. State motor vehicle records show that he had been convicted of several traffic violations, including going through red lights and failing to stop for stop signs, that had led to the revocation of his license. The records show that after the revocation, he was issued more tickets for driving infractions, which led to the license suspensions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940714","headline":"Watson's Heart, Soul Deep in Highlands","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/14/sports/golf-watson-s-heart-soul-deep-in-highlands.html","abstract":"  The call came early this week, from Tom Watson to Jack Nicklaus.

Hugo Tiest, coordinator of a church-based group, Justice and Peace of the Haitian Conference of Religion, which supports the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. \"I am afraid of the end results.\" A Long View    Some Haitians said they remained optimistic that a peaceful way could be found out of the impasse that has hardened since army leaders ousted Father Aristide in September 1991.  \"We spent 300 years in slavery,\" said Bayyinah Bello, who works with several local political groups. \"So three years in the life of a people is no time.\"   The Haitian military's campaign of terror has largely been aimed at the local organizations that form the backbone of Father Aristide's support, trying to insure that if the exiled President returns, he will not be able to govern.   The level of intimidation increased on Monday after the army-backed Government ordered all human rights observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States to leave Haiti by today. On Tuesday, about 12 bodies riddled with bullets were dumped into a shallow grave near Leogane, 18 miles west.    In the months that they have been in the country, the 100 or so monitors have concluded that many killings were directly attributable to the army and its allies.  A Sample of Intimidation    Today, two men who said they were supporters of the exiled President walked into Father Tiest's downtown office and told him they needed help. But the priest said he became suspicious when the men showed him a picture of Father Aristide instead of identification.    One man drew a gun and demanded files. Father Tiest said a worker then screamed for help and the men fled. \"These are assassins and criminals,\" the priest said.   With the departure of the international observers, Haitian human rights workers are wondering how effectively they can do their work.    \"We find ourselves alone in the face of the reality of political repression,\" said Jean Robert Vaval, of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights. \"But we will continue to fight for human rights. It's our job.\"   Mr. Vaval and others said that while much attention had been given to the plight of Haitian boat people, the refugeees within the country were an even more serious problem. These refugees, estimated at 350,000, have left their jobs and homes and live in a different city every week, trying to keep ahead of marauding soldiers.   One such refugee, a man in his 30's, said he was a member of a political organization in the Artibonite Valley in northwest Haiti. Since the coup, he said, he has moved from house to house until finding refuge in a Port-au-Prince church.  Pay Attention, World    \"I am not afraid because I have weathered the worst,\" he said, adding that he was arrested several months ago and released because of the intervention of the international observers. \"But too many people have suffered for me and now I don't want to jeopardize their lives.\"   The international monitors have been been reluctant to talk, fearing their comments might upset Haiti's military leaders. But many have voiced sadness at having to leave without completing their task.    \"I hope that the international community thinks this is enough and takes some decisive action to end this crisis now,\" said one member of the mission. \"It's a turning point because some people have perceived before that this was mainly a U.S. problem.\"                     --------------------       Corpses as a Weapon    WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) -- Haiti's rulers are intensifying repression, and their latest tactic is to dump the bodies of murdered political opponents in the streets to terrorize the people, a State Department official said today.    The official, Nancy Ely-Raphel, from the department's human rights section, said that in the past two weeks, several corpses of young men with their hands tied behind their backs had been found in the streets of Port-au-Prince.    Ms. Ely-Raphel said 133 killings had been reported between February and May. But she added: \"We believe we may now be seeing a further ratcheting up of repression. The latest developments include increased dumping of bodies in public areas of Port-au-Prince in an attempt to terrorise the populace.\"                     --------------------       Exercise in Bahamas    WASHINGTON, July 13 (AP) -- Several hundred United States marines began a practice invasion-and-rescue operation today on Grand Inagua Island in the Bahamas, 150 miles northwest of Haiti, Pentagon sources said.

Mr. Williams was a relatively unknown singer based in Chicago, and Count Basie was suffering from the general decline in interest in big bands. Their collaboration, matching a gleaming, industrial-strength orchestra with the dry and clipped singing of Mr. Williams, was a high point in blues culture, and \"Every Day I Have the Blues,\" a single from the album, rose to the No. 2 spot on the rhythm-and-blues charts.   Since then Count Basie has died, and blues culture is fading away as a training ground for younger musicians. But Mr. Williams, who is appearing through Sunday at the Blue Note, backed by the Count Basie Orchestra led by Frank Foster, remains something special, a way into a sound and musical attitude that by and large no longer exist. And on the basis of the first set on Tuesday night, Mr. Williams, 75, is more than able to make a lesson in history seem utterly contemporary, turning his art into something thrilling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940714","headline":"Helping Excite Toronto Over Books for 20 Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/14/books/helping-excite-toronto-over-books-for-20-years.html","abstract":"  It's 8 P.M. on a Tuesday in a cultural center on transformed industrial land along Lake Ontario.

New Jersey is not the only state under court orders to equalize school aid, but it is one of the most obstinate. The issue has been in and out of litigation for almost 25 years -- a quarter-century of neglect for the state's urban schoolchildren.
