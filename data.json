The absorbing two-hour program tonight on Channel 13 carries forward the story begun in \"China in Revolution, 1911-1949,\" also produced, written and directed by Sue Williams. The remarkable pictures of upheaval and suppression and the testimony of Mao's followers and victims create a chronicle of achievement, misadventure, cruelty and havoc.

He had already published a slightly noticed novella, but had to face the unwelcome news that his new book, about the aftermath of World War II in a ravaged Cologne, was hardly the sort of thing that could establish a fledgling literary reputation in 1950's Germany. His publisher refused to issue it, saying it wasn't good enough but meaning, it is now clear, that the subject matter was just too depressing and dark for the beaten and war-weary country to cope with.    The rejection almost caused Boll -- who had repeatedly been forced to stop work on \"The Silent Angel\" to churn out short stories to pay the rent and help support his three small sons -- to give up writing altogether. Instead, the author, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1972, ended up incorporating many of the themes and characters from \"The Silent Angel\" into subsequent works. The protagonist, Hans Schnitzler, is seen by Boll scholars as the precursor to Hans Schnier in Boll's 1963 novel \"The Clown.\" But Boll died in 1985 with \"The Silent Angel\" still unpublished.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940413","headline":"The House Tackles Crime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/opinion/the-house-tackles-crime.html","abstract":"  Now it is the House's turn to debate a crime bill that foolishly creates a slew of new Federal crimes and death penalties to display \"toughness\" but also extends a badly needed Federal hand -- and dollar -- to anxious states and localities for crime control programs.

Western countries value the individual above society; in Asia, he said, the good of society is deemed more important than individual liberties. This comfortable bit of sophistry helps governments from China to Indonesia rationalize abuses and marginalize courageous people who campaign for causes like due process and freedom from torture. Western nations, it is asserted, have no right to impose their values on countries that govern themselves successfully according to their own values.   So, the argument goes, when Americans express outrage over a punishment that causes permanent scarring -- in this case, caning -- they are committing an act of cultural arrogance, assuming that American values are intrinsically superior to those of another culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940413","headline":"Firefighter's Status Worse After Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/13/nyregion/firefighter-s-status-worse-after-surgery.html","abstract":"  Capt.

A nonmalignant version of the gene had been found before by biologists studying the normal mechanisms that control the cycle of cell growth and division.

The inspired ideas behind \"Bailey's Cafe,\" which has been directed by Novella Nelson, hover luminously over a work that is still struggling hard to give them graceful theatrical form. Its allegorical elements, which were woven more slyly into the fabric of the novel, have been expanded and exaggerated here, and the play simply can't sustain their full weight.

She made the character dramatically vivid, tracing grand gestures that fell comfortably short of melodrama.   Miss Dimitrova was the bright spot in a fairly bleak evening. Whatever dramatic momentum she incited ran up against the crushing dullness of Lando Bartolini's Radames.

For the members of the Akazu, the ruling clan around the late President Juvenal Habyarimana, the only way to retain a 21-year monopoly on power was to kill their enemies as fast as they could. And until yesterday, when anti-Government rebels overran the capital of Kigali, that brutal clique was getting help from an unlikely quarter: France.   Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate until it gained independence in 1962, and until recently it got most of its military aid from Belgium. But Belgian law prohibits any lethal aid to a country at war. In 1975, two years after he seized power by deposing the President who had appointed him, Mr. Habyarimana signed a military cooperation agreement with France. When the rebel guerrillas of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (harbored and largely armed by neighboring Uganda) invaded in 1990 and again last year, it was France that rushed in combat troops, mortars and artillery to help the Government.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940414","headline":"Dallas Investor Wins Senate Nomination","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/14/us/dallas-investor-wins-senate-nomination.html","abstract":"  Richard W.
