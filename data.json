Booker T. & the MG's, the Stax Records house band that performed behind Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and other soul greats while recording distinctive instrumental songs of their own, make music built on disciplined, understated playing and thrifty, gentle grooves. The Fugees, a hip-hop band featuring two Haitian men and one American woman, structure their sound from festive, shambling raps and loose, rambunctious grooves. Both bands, however, concoct inventive and immediate music that is neither too strict nor too indulgent.   Booker T. & the MG's set list was as orderly as their performing style. Throughout the hour-plus show, they alternated a song from their new album, \"That's the Way It Should Be\" (Columbia), the band's first record in 17 years, with an older song. They opened the set with their recent, languid reworking of Bob Dylan's \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" -- perhaps the only low point on the band's wonderfully spartan new album besides their cover of U2's \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" -- before moving on to the older, stronger \"Melting Pot.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940705","headline":"How Nature Makes a Butterfly's Wing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/science/how-nature-makes-a-butterfly-s-wing.html","abstract":"  THE spray of colors on a butterfly's wing, a vivid pattern painted with the iridescent dust of thousands of tiny scales, ranks among nature's more entrancing mysteries. Though some like to keep wonders inviolate, others find a greater pleasure in understanding the elegant genetic machinery by which such beauty and diversity are generated. For the latter, an article in the current issue of Science goes a long way toward explaining the miracle of how a butterfly's wing is made.   A team of biologists at the University of Wisconsin in Madison has traced out how a handful of genes become activated in the embryonic wing disks that are secretly budding while the butterfly is still a lumbering caterpillar. The genes produce substances that mark the position of each cell in the future wing with almost the precision of defining squares on a piece of graph paper.  Once the coordinates are fixed, another crew of genes sketches out the dance of eyespots, chevrons, bands and dashes that make up butterfly wing patterns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940705","headline":"New Images Support Planets of Other Stars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/science/new-images-support-planets-of-other-stars.html","abstract":"  MORE possible evidence for the existence of planets around stars other than the Sun has been detected by French astronomers examining new infrared pictures of the disk of dusty particles orbiting the star Beta Pictoris, about 52 light-years away.

Conservative Arab regimes, led by Saudi Arabia, sought a U.N. peacekeeping force to halt the north's offensive. So far, U.N. efforts have been limited to unsuccessful mediation attempts and useless cease-fire agreements that break down almost instantly. The Saudis and their allies are also poised to recognize the south, which would re-create the two independent Yemens that merged in 1990. The United States, however, opposes recognition.

It was a masterly pitch, and it left everyone from the fans to the Giant hitters wondering whether Saberhagen was about to throw his second career no-hitter, or perhaps even a perfect game, this afternoon at Candlestick Park.   \"I saw that pitch,\" said Todd Hundley, the Mets' catcher, \"and all I could think was, 'Man, I'm glad I'm not facing him today.'

Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/nyregion/corruption-in-uniform-chronology-tracking-police-corruption-over-the-years.html","abstract":"  Sept. 23, 1986: More than a decade after the Knapp Commission focused wide attention on corruption among the police and after years of relative quiet, the police department is rocked by the arrests of eleven officers from the 77th Precinct in Bedford-Stuvesant who knocked down doors, stole money and drugs from drug dealers and resold the stolen drugs. The \"Buddy Boys\" case is the department's first major corruption scandal since the Knapp Commission exposed organized \"pads\" that ran extortion operations out of nearly every precinct house. It was out of the Knapp Commission that the Internal Affairs Division was born. Oct. 31, 1986: Twenty-seven supervisors are transferred out of the precinct by Commissioner Benjamin Ward, but no need is seen for an investigation of the department's anti-corruption efforts. March 1991: Apparently no corruption troubles are in sight. The state disbands the office of Special Prosecutor for corruption and agres to give money to the district attorneys to fight corruption. To date, only a fraction of the money promised has been delivered. May 7, 1992: A group of six New York City police officers, led by Officer Michael Dowd, are arrested for cocaine trafficking by the Suffolk County police, raising a host of questions about oversign and the Blue Wall of Silence. Why didn't the department's own investigators uncover the scandal in light of flagrant misconduct over many years by Officer Dowd? Had the department looked the other way? One person, anyway, sees no major cracks. Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown calls the department's system for weeding out corruption \"a system that police agencies across the country look to.\" June 25, 1992: Mayor David N. Dinkins announces the creation of a special panel to investigate corruption, and as its head, names Milton Mollen, a former judge and former Deputy Mayor for public safety, as well as a close friend. Commissioner Brown, who opposed the panel, was conspicuously absent from the announcement. June 29, 1992: Commissioner Brown finally acknowledges a problem. He announces tougher anti-corruption measures that on the surface seem rather basic. Investigators will finally be supplied with modern surveillance equipment and even new cars that will help them avoid detection from officers under scrutiny. He also asks his top deputy, Raymond W. Kelly, to prepare a report on why the department failed to stop Officer Dowd. But law enforcement officials say the response is too late, that the Internal Affairs Division had been bungling cases for years. One officials calls it a \"secret waiting to come out.\" July 30, 1992: More problems for Michael Dowd. He is arrested on Federal charges that he took huge weekly cash payments from drug gangs. Officials say he offered protection from police raids and in return took in as much as $8,000 a week. Nov. 16, 1992: Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announces a major revamping of the Internal Affairs monitoring system, starting with an upgrading of its status to Internal Affairs Bureau and creating more accountability among investigators. Mollen Commission officials say the changes do not go nearly far enough. Sept. 27, 1993: The Mollen Commission begins the city's first public hearings on police corruption in more than 20 years with a star witness: Michael Dowd. He says that early in his career other officers indoctrinated him with the attitude: \"never rat against another cop.\" There is testimony from a hooded informant named \"Mr. X\" and from former police officials and investigators who reveal tales of corruption and brutality in the 9th Precinct in the East Village and in many of the city's minority communities. It is learned that Internal Affairs has long maintained a secret \"tickler\" file for charges made against its own investigators, rather than pass the allegations on to prosecutors. Dec. 28, 1993: An interim report released by the Mollen Commission is a sign of things to come. The commission declares the department \"incompetent\" in policing itself. March 8, 1994: The commission produces its first criminal case when three officers from the 73d Precinct in Brownsville are charged with dealing drugs, usually while on duty. The officers called themselves the Morgue Boys because they often met divide their profits outside a factory that had once manufactured refrigerators for morgues. March 18, 1994: Three officers from the 30th Precinct are caught on videotape beating up Harlem residents and stealing drugs and cash. Eleven more officers from the precinct will eventually be arrested. And another new police commissioner, William J. Bratton, tries to put his own stamp on the corruption battle. He pronounces that no one will ever wear the badges of the arrested officers. To date, he has transferred eight of 22 supervisors from the precinct, as well as 25 of the precinct's 191 officers, many on suspicions that they knew about corruption but did not tell. July 6, 1994: The Commission's final report is issued. Its central proposal is the creation of an independent commission, appointed by the Mayor, to review police department efforts to eliminate corruption and to conduct its own investigations.

Now, as he visits Poland, comes news that commando units of the United States Army and Navy have been practicing a takeover of Haiti's ports and airfields.   It is hard to believe that the Pentagon's willingness to discuss these \"secret\" maneuvers is not part of a plan to flush Gen. Raoul Cedras and his henchmen out of Haiti. That is a worthy goal, but the timing is amateurish and the underlying message is troubling. Washington and the United Nations have only recently gotten serious about enforcing meaningful economic sanctions. These need to be given a chance to produce political results.

His words were far from incendiary. He was merely defending \"the basic American principle of separation of church and state.\" The speech was heartfelt, telling of his penniless immigrant father's escape from Russia to America in 1911. The Senator seemed to be speaking not just as a politician but as a Jew.    Is it coincidence that Mr. Specter, the only Jewish Republican Senator, is one of the very few G.O.P. leaders who have dared criticize the Christian right? Hardly. If you are an American Jew, you have every reason to worry about a political movement whose most powerful leader, Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition, calls the constitutional separation of church and state \"a lie of the left\" and vows to dismantle it. I, for one, still remember how it felt to be a Jew involuntarily praying to Jesus in a public elementary school before the Supreme Court outlawed school prayer in 1962.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Ewing Undergoes Knee Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/sports/sports-people-basketball-ewing-undergoes-knee-surgery.html","abstract":"  Knicks center PATRICK EWING underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee yesterday at the Beth Israel Medical Center-North Division in Manhattan.

The information superhighway. It's all there, examined in vivid detail. There is also a thought or two about the rapacious character of advertising.    Back when advertising was still in its crib, Mr. Dick correctly forecast that it would someday be a consuming force. In the world of \"Blade Runner,\" skyscrapers are covered top to bottom with television screens that scream with ads 24 hours a day. Commercials no longer sit still and beg to be looked at. Instead, they become fly-like robots that perch on the pillow and whisper sweet nothings while you sleep. The next morning you wake up craving foods you've never eaten. Mr. Dick's characters defend themselves by keeping their windows closed -- and making heavy use of fly swatters.

The two legislators, Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Jerrold Nadler of New York, both Democrats, heard testimony from the couple and from their opponents, who denied any effort to run them out of town but condemned the radical social agenda that the critics said was being promoted at the couple's feminist camp.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Astros' General Manager Undergoes Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/sports/sports-people-baseball-astros-general-manager-undergoes-surgery.html","abstract":"  The Houston Astros' general manager, BOB WATSON, underwent successful surgery yesterday for removal of his cancerous prostate gland.

Driven by Walter Case Jr., Wesgate Crown will be starting from Post 6 in the event at Yonkers Raceway.   The raceway also announced yesterday that one of trotting's centerpiece events, the International Trot, would be suspended for 1994 for economic reasons, as well as because of declining attendance and handle. The International, originally scheduled for Aug. 13, began in 1959 at Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, L.I., and was moved to Yonkers in 1988. Its promoters hope to bring it back next year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Ukraine Is to Russia As Ireland Is to Britain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/opinion/l-ukraine-is-to-russia-as-ireland-is-to-britain-605794.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Same Roots Nourish Russia and Ukraine\" (letter, June 28), Michael Averko states that Ukraine and Russia cannot be considered separate nations because they are too related, citing as a comparison Scotland, Wales and England, the components of Britain.
