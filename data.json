Whether shot in busy bars and streets or cluttered apartments and dressing rooms, Ms. Goldin's photographs blur the boundaries between public and private, the posed and the exposed. Often details in the background suggest that the photographer's subjects maintain a tense relationship with the larger world: the red AIDS ribbon pinned to Mistress Formica's long-line bra; the police officer who grins benignly at a transvestite while protectively clutching a nightstick; the handwritten signs at a bar advertising drinks to benefit a patron \"hospitalized due to police brutality.\" As Ms. Goldin observes, \"It takes nerve to walk down the street when you fall between the cracks.\" This occasionally somber, often joyous book captures the transvestites' distinctive walk and celebrates their nerve, but never misses a crack.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Van Cliburn Contestant in His Debut at Caramoor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/nyregion/music-van-cliburn-contestant-in-his-debut-at-caramoor.html","abstract":"  THE diversity typical of the musical summer at Caramoor is certainly at hand this week, with two piano programs, a pair of chamber recitals and an evening of jazz.

The appeal of the alternative means of keeping pests under control coincides with the current awareness to do the right thing as far as tending the land is concerned.   The practice of integrated pest management can be carried out whether someone tends a half-acre plot or manages the land of a huge wholesale nursery. As a case in point, American Nurseryman recently surveyed wholesale growers. Those who managed as many as 200 acres advocated following some I.P.M. practices in keeping pest populations under control. In fact, 70 percent of the wholesalers who responded to the survey said that they did not apply pesticides on a fixed schedule, while only 30 percent said they did. In other words, the trend is toward targeting controls of troublesome insects rather than spraying on schedule just because certain insects are expected to appear at certain times.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"In the Path of the Flood, Hard Times Just Got Harder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/us/in-the-path-of-the-flood-hard-times-just-got-harder.html","abstract":"  The flood water that swamped Deerfield Village Mobile Home Park here last month has receded nearly a foot in recent days, but it has left the twin plagues of foul-smelling mud and larger-than-life mosquitoes.

That image was dented by the country's divisions over the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which will strengthen Denmark's ties with the European Community.

At the foot of these peaks, the towns of Versilia have since attracted internationally acclaimed sculptors like Jean Arp, Jacques Lipschitz and Isamu Noguchi, all seeking inspiration in the enchanted white dust. Henry Moore, who owned a house here in the 60's and 70's, reveled when he first saw the quarries: \"I was like a little child seeing the window of a sweet shop.\"\n\nPietrasanta, a town of 25,000 in the valley, translates as holy stone. A 14th-century duomo, made of ocher-splotched marble with a characteristic red-brick campanile, opens onto a piazza fringed by Renaissance buildings of mellowed apricot, and assorted open-air studios. Hundreds of sculptors flock here from around the world, stimulated by the sheer quantity of work that goes on. English, German, Dutch, and Swedish can be heard, often in staccato, over the rat-a-tat of chisels. The local artisans can produce anything to scale, and the sculpture laboratories, as they are called, have specialists for every imaginable flourish: angel wings, babies, flowers, small animals, simple clothes and flowing robes. Many laboratories rent space to visiting sculptors; others arrive in town with a model or sketch. Pietrasanta's craftsmen can realize nearly any design in the local Carrara marble, but they are at their best when rendering the sculptures of the world's leading artists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"A Retouching Pen To Remove Red-Eye","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/style/camera-a-retouching-pen-to-remove-red-eye.html","abstract":"  RED-EYE is one of color photography's persistent problems. Its cause is well known, but the solution is evasive. The flash from the camera strikes the back of the eye, which is full of tiny red blood vessels and reflects directly into the camera as a picture is taken. The finished prints look as if the subjects have turned into ghouls -- red beamspouring out of their eyes like lasers.   When point-and-shoot cameras appeared in the early 1980's, engineers turned to various solutions -- moving the flash further from the lens, or pre-flashing the subject so the pupils closed down, thus cutting back on reflection problems. In spite of this effort, the problem only subsided, but was not eliminated.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Do Threads of Five Lives Lead to One Serial Killer?; Investigators Sift Details and Look for Links in Murders of Gay and Bisexual Men","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/nyregion/threads-five-lives-lead-one-serial-killer-investigators-sift-details-look-for.html","abstract":"  They spanned the broad experience of gay life, a life led with a current of tension and secrecy under even the most tolerant of circumstances.

A sort of one-man singing newspaper, he typically combines smatterings of news with editorial reflection on everything from music to sex to religion.    As Mr. Joel has matured, his usually noncontroversial opinions have grown even broader and less prickly. And on his new album, \"River of Dreams\" (Columbia 53003; CD, cassette and mini-disk), the 44-year-old singer and songwriter from Hicksville, Long Island, makes the transition from aging rock-and-roll rebel to middle-aged suburban pundit, playing the role of philosophic everyman with a windy bravado.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Remembering A Different Sarajevo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/travel/remembering-a-different-sarajevo.html","abstract":"  IT was a warm May evening, and we were having drinks with friends in the garden cafe of the Hotel Europa -- a dignified and slightly faded grand hotel that, with its Turkish carpets, its burnished wooden floors and overstuffed plush furniture, seemed designed for secret assignations in a spy novel by Eric Ambler or Graham Greene. Paper lanterns glowed softly in the trees of the garden, and, as the waiter brought more wine, our friends spoke of the worsening hardships of life in their city: the mounting ethnic tensions, an inflation rate so high that their salaries depreciated in the half hour it took them to cross town and exchange their dinars for hard currency. But even these problems seemed somehow less pressing as we laughed and drank wine and watched our children play soccer in the garden with other children from France, from Germany, from all over Yugoslavia.   Suddenly there was a commotion. A group of gypsy children had run into the cafe. Everyone was screaming, because one tiny gypsy girl had a broken, jagged broomstick and was tossing it like a javelin. The gypsy children ran away as quickly as they'd come, and I remember thinking, very clearly: Something's missing. What was gone was my younger son Leon's denim jacket, which he'd tossed over a chair. The kids had nimbly lifted it as they'd left. Leon's shock and sense of betrayal was enormous; he was only slightly comforted when, the next morning, we managed to find him a new denim jacket in the city market.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"A Drive for Smoke-Free Restaurants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/nyregion/a-drive-for-smokefree-restaurants.html","abstract":"IT was lunchtime at Tiffany's, a popular restaurant in Summit, and Fernando Iamurridi and Seth Malkin were smoking at the bar with their law partner and friend, Murray Klayman.\n\n\"We eat here quite a lot,\" Mr. Iamurridi said, lighting up another cigarette while waiting for a table outside. \"If I couldn't be comfortable and allowed to smoke here, I wouldn't come back.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"On Beyond Wellness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/books/on-beyond-wellness.html","abstract":"LISTENING TO PROZAC \nBy Peter D.

Many Danish manor houses are home to such stories, which people connected to the manors will gladly, even gleefully, relate. But the real ghosts, in a sense, are the manors themselves. Denmark is a fiercely egalitarian country now -- income tax begins at around 50 percent -- so the rich and famous are not so rich here.

When he tells us that the Baroque overture reflects the pomp of a royal court, he points to the music's occasion, not its character. A Sousa march is pomp and circumstance too: does its playing on the Fourth of July make it democratic?   Politics is an ambiguous term anyway. The article that prompted the Broyles letter used the term to mean partisanship, advocacy. An established regime is not political in that sense; it is only the way society is organized. A piece of music may suit festivities -- as a church service does -- without advocating anything, just serving the human urge to celebrate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"In the Region: New Jersey;\nRentals Blooming in Lawrence Township","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/realestate/in-the-region-new-jersey-rentals-blooming-in-lawrence-township.html","abstract":"AFTER seven and a half years of planning and negotiations, work is finally under way on a 426-unit rental housing complex on 20 acres in the southeastern section of Lawrence Township.

Six letter writers and the editor attributed it to eight of the usual suspects: George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, Howard Dietz, Robert Benchley, Ilka Chase, Tallulah Bankhead's husband and Goodman Ace. In another letter in the same issue we found the poet Anthony Hecht upbraiding the novelist Alison Lurie for failing to notice a light-fingered borrowing by the novelist Peter Ackroyd from the poet Wordsworth about some sentimental mist glittering over some plashy earth. This is also missing from Bartlett's -- though the new edition has finally caught up with Evelyn Waugh's far more important plashitude: \"Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole.\"   Pity the editors of any familiar quotations volume. The culture moves so fast these days. Who knows whose bons mots will be borrowed, twisted, misremembered and misattributed in next week's Book Review? John Bartlett himself, having begun in 1855 with the essential smattering of Bible, Shakespeare and mostly English stalwarts, went through nine editions in his lifetime without ever awakening to his contemporaries Whitman, Thoreau or Melville. Today editors have to keep their fingers more tightly on the pulse. Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley have become ancient sages; to capture the words now on our lips and pens, the new edition has felt obliged to canonize less venerable authors like the Doors (\"Come on, baby, light my fire\"), \"Sesame Street\" (\"Me want cookie!\") and Monty Python's Flying Circus (\"This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot\").

It is, quite simply, that Tivoli appeals to all ages.   So, there they were, prams and wheelchairs, arriving punctually as the gardens in the middle of the city opened at 10 A.M. Soon they were joined by mothers trying to control exuberant youngsters, while old men and women strode purposefully through the gardens. By lunchtime, businessmen and tourists were filling the park's 28 restaurants. Then, as the afternoon advanced into evening, families, young couples and groups of friends joined the crowds.

They like the fact that it raises taxes on the rich and increases the incomes of the working poor. They also like the fact that it should lower the budget deficit from around 5 percent of the gross national product to around 3 percent. \n\nFor those who live beyond the Beltway, however, these are not the big issues. For them, the question is whether the Democrats' budget will help revive the economy. Bill Clinton got to the White House by promising faster growth and better jobs. If he cannot deliver on that promise, few voters will support him in 1996 just because he reduced the deficit. And despite its other virtues, this budget will not do much to hasten economic recovery. Indeed, by focusing so heavily on deficit reduction, it may well make the recovery slower.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"OUTDOORS;\nYou Can Go Home Again to the Fishing Holes of Your Youth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/sports/outdoors-you-can-go-home-again-to-the-fishing-holes-of-your-youth.html","abstract":"My neighbor Bob Basmajian's goats brayed and his flock of outlandish guinea fowls scattered beside the jeep as my 8-year-old niece Lizzy and I followed the rough trail down to the large pond at Camp Nubar.

It opens in 1977 and earns a profit of between $20 million and $30 million before closing in 1983. The first attempt at a sequel, \"Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge,\" costs $7 million and closes in 1990 after a tryout in Washington and negative reviews. Abandoned by its producers, \"Annie 2\" evolves into \"Annie Warbucks.\" The show is produced by Karen Walter Goodwin, who tours it around the country in 1992. With a budget of $5.5 million, it is scheduled to open on Broadway in April of this year. But then something happens . . . .  Feb. 19, 1993: The Dream Dies  Karen Walter Goodwin announces that \"Annie Warbucks\" will not make it to Broadway in 1993 for lack of money. March 9: Hold It! The Dream Lives  Ben Sprecher, the co-owner of the 499-seat Variety Arts Theater Off Broadway, calls Martin Charnin, the director of \"Annie Warbucks,\" and offers to produce the musical at his theater. Mr. Sprecher had made an offer once before, but Mr. Charnin, his heart set on Broadway, was unreceptive. This time, he reacts differently. Mr. Sprecher: \"He looked at me. I looked at him. His head went back, and his forehead read 'Tilt!' \"   March 11: They Think They're Gonna Like It Here  The \"Annie Warbucks\" creative team -- Mr. Charnin, the show's lyricist, the composer Charles Strouse and the book writer Thomas Meehan -- inspect the Variety Arts, a theater on Third Avenue near 14th Street that Mr. Sprecher and William P. Miller bought in 1990 and renovated. It opened in the fall of 1991 with \"Return to the Forbidden Planet,\" a science-fiction musical that closed in April 1992. In November the play \"Program for Murder\" lasted less than a month, and the Variety Arts has been dark ever since. But the former porn theater apparently looks right for the redhead. The team agrees on the spot that the show will go on.   May 6: Honey, They Shrunk the Kids  A news conference is called to announce that \"Annie Warbucks\" is alive. In a parody of the Lorenz Hart song \"Where or When,\" Mr. Charnin croons to the assembled journalists, \"It seems we stood and talked like this before . . . The smirk you are smirking you were smirking then.\" A downsized version of \"Annie Warbucks\" will go into rehearsal at the Variety Arts, produced by Mr. Sprecher, Mr. Miller and Dennis J. Grimaldi. The $5.5 million musical will come in at $1 million, with all actors except Harve Presnell (reprising his role of Daddy Warbucks) working for Off Broadway scale. Just how small is it? Mr. Sprecher: \"It's as if you took the Broadway show, threw it in the washing machine in hot water, and it came out about three-quarters the original size.\"  May 10: Attack of the Little People  Many small girls converge on the theater in response to an open call for the orphans. May 26: Dog Day Afternoon  Cindy Lou, a mixed-breed terrier who plays Sandy, gets a second understudy. If Cosmo can't go on, Buby (pronounced Bubba) will. June 10: Mini Annie  First rehearsal. The cast has shed, along with the second chorus, Lauren Gaffney, the stalwart Annie of \"Annie Warbucks.\" Now 13, she is too old and too large. Her replacement is the very small, very young, very loud Kathryn Zaremba, a 9-year-old from Broken Arrow, Okla. \"One of her most endearing qualities, from my point of view, is she isn't even 4 feet tall yet,\" says Mr. Charnin.  July 8: A New Deal for Daddy?  First preview of the show, in which the evil child welfare commissioner, Harriet Doyle (replacing the evil Miss Hannigan), tells Warbucks he has 60 days to find a wife or Annie goes back to the orphanage. Donna McKechnie has signed on as Mrs. Kelly, a possible love interest for Daddy.  Aug. 9: Tomorrow, Tomorrow  \"Annie Warbucks\" is scheduled to open exactly 17 years after the original \"Annie\" opened at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn. Mr. Charnin: \"The main thing is, it's going to happen, and I don't have to sit on a stool with hand puppets, which was the plan of last resort.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Lee S.

I was most appreciative of the scholarly, legal arguments Professor Ginsburg presented.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Liability Is Being Shifted to Auto Renters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/travel/practical-traveler-liability-is-being-shifted-to-auto-renters.html","abstract":"  FIVE major auto rental companies are shifting a new financial responsibility onto the renter. These companies, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Hertz and National, have changed their rental contracts in various states to make the renter's own insurance policy the first line of defense if there is an accident involving a liability claim -- i.e., one that injures or kills other people or damages others' property. Until recently, the liability insurance that rental companies are required to maintain by state laws was the primary coverage.    For drivers who do not carry liability insurance or do not want to put their own policies on the line, the rental companies offer an alternative, which they sell under various names for an added daily fee of $8 or so. For those without liability coverage who do not buy this, the renting company's back-up coverage becomes the primary coverage, but there is a possibility that the rental company will turn around and sue the renter. Rich McEvily, a lawyer for Hertz, said, \"We say to the renter, \"It's up to you to protect your own assets.' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"SURFACING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/style/surfacing.html","abstract":"  FASHION -- Multitrend products: The bandanna/baseball cap and the platform-soled Birkenstock are the inevitable and questionable results of trend-mongering run amok.

But in his new film, opening on Friday, the production designer Stuart Craig faced a particularly difficult task -- finding ways to make \"The Secret Garden\" fresh.   The source material, of course, is Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved story of an orphan whose discovery of a hidden and neglected garden fills her deathly world with life. Published in 1911, the book has spawned adaptations as varied as a Margaret O'Brien film in 1949, a BBC children's special in 1975 and a 1991 Broadway musical. The current version, from Francis Ford Coppola's film company American Zoetrope, was directed by the Polish film maker Agnieszka Holland (\"Europa, Europa\") with a cast including Maggie Smith as the housekeeper and a group of young unknowns. Mr. Craig, accordingly, knew that the secret garden itself -- indeed, the entire look of the movie -- must function as its star; this was a film as much about plants as people, about physical location as a gauge of spiritual growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"Union Leaders Fight for a Place in the President's Workplace of the Future","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/us/union-leaders-fight-for-a-place-in-the-president-s-workplace-of-the-future.html","abstract":"  As the Clinton Administration seeks to define the high-performance workplace of the future, union leaders are fighting for a place in that definition.

Bounding across the living room of his home in the Hollywood Hills with the manic energy of a truant 10-year-old, the platinum-blond, spiky-haired singer is fixating on one of his favorite toys, a palm-sized camcorder. The device is sitting atop his enormo-screen television set, pointed toward a sofa across the room and playing it live on the television, turning what was supposed to be a simple, low-tech print interview into a do-it-yourself media event. Welcome to the wonderful world of Idolvision!   Wearing a black T-shirt, magenta silk pants, combat boots and purple sunglasses, Mr. Idol looks something like an overgrown punk-rock version of Macaulay Culkin with his finger in a light socket.

When in Europe with small children, one delightful way to pass the time and see the sights is to use as a guide a favorite storybook, such as \"Babar Loses His Crown\" or \"Paddington Bear.\" In the case of the former, with young Jonny Goldin clutching his own stuffed Babar, five Goldins traipsed from the bateau mouche to the Tour Eiffel to the Opera, everywhere looking for Babar's lost crown, following the book's text as itinerary. In London we retraced Paddington Bear's steps, again using the wonderful children's story as a guide and reading the text on bus rides between destinations.

Then architecture reversed direction. Since the 1970's, many architects have contrived to put the starch back into buildings. The classical elegies of Michael Graves, the stiff-white-collar modernism of Richard Meier, the overwrought geometries of Peter Eisenman: though these esthetics have assumed vastly different forms, they share an evident antipathy toward the unstructured spaces promoted by modern architecture. Each yearns for a time when it was the architect's job to reinforce social  formalities.   The Temporary Powell Library, a bright balloon of a building that alighted a year ago on the Westwood campus of U.C.L.A., is blithely oblivious to formal dress codes. Designed by the Santa Monica firm Hodgetts & Fung, this ephemeral structure shares common ground with student life. Immensely popular with the university's undergraduates, the Temporary Powell has also become a mecca for visiting architects. Earlier this year, it was honored with an award for design excellence from the American Institute of Architects. With its playful air of spontaneity bolted down by innate rigor, the Temporary Powell revives informality as an architectural ideal. And it raises the question of why that ideal fell from favor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930808","headline":"A Wave of Boardsailors to Hit Beach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/08/sports/windsurfing-notebook-a-wave-of-boardsailors-to-hit-beach.html","abstract":"  Jayne Fenner, the No. 1 boardsailor in the United States, has seen jams at a starting line before.

While shaking is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. Deeper earthquakes also have less interaction with the surface, and their energy is spread out across a larger volume.

New Jersey's largest non-shellfish catch is of Menhaden, a common bait fish, at more than 27 million pounds in 1992. In contrast, the area's recreational fishing harvest has declined, due partly to the region's sluggish economy and also since a Federal law went into effect limiting andlers to 10 bluefish (the most popular sporting fish on the East Coast) a day.

Or at least Britain's rapacious television commentators seemed to feel its disappearance was welcome; they had mocked the poor beast unmercifully since it first lumbered to life.   A roundelay of romantic entanglements and low-life skulduggery set in an imaginary Spanish resort community, the series was everything that Anglophilic admirers of Masterpiece Theater think is foreign to British television: bloated, leaden, dull. Worst of all, it committed the sin of sins for a soap: the characters weren't sexy, weren't appealing, weren't in any way suitable for fantastical self-projection by couch potatoes. They weren't even ordinary enough to seem lifelike. Money Couldn't Buy Love    The set alone, built in southern Spain, cost more than $3 million; the budget was five times that, making the show the most expensive independent production ever commissioned by the BBC. The critics, especially in London's tabloid press, were merciless: \"In its early days, 157 episodes ago, 'Eldorado' was almost treasurably bad,\" The Guardian wrote just before the final show on July 9. \"But then it began to improve. It became mediocre instead of dire.\" The audience watched elsewhere, with rarely more than a third of the projected 15 million people tuning in. The Producer's Assessment    As it happens, \"Eldorado\" was meant, at least in part, to be a serious soap, and its producer, Verity Lambert, has been quoted to the effect that it failed not because it was bad but because it was too experimental. Her credits, after all, include shows of just the sort that have given British television a good name in the United States: \"Dr. Who,\" \"Rumpole of the Bailey,\" \"The Naked Civil Servant\" and the like. And the new head of drama for the BBC, Charles Denton, seems now to be aiming even lower, unashamedly courting the biggest possible audience. \"We are in direct competition with ITV for the mainstream popular audience,\" he told The Independent.

At Roseland last Tuesday night, in a sold-out triple bill with Stone Temple Pilots and Flaming Lips, the band trotted out its dependable act. A decade of touring has turned into a routine, with Gibby Haynes's growled, rasped, distorted vocals, Paul Leary's acid-rock guitar, a selection of surgical-instruction and ethnographic films, and a finale in which Mr. Haynes sets a cymbal afire with lighter fluid and hits it with a drumstick to send flames aloft.   The band's name, printable but outrageous, promises taboo-tweaking titillation, while its lyrics growl about party-hearty apathy and bodily decay, controlled wildness that's perfect for the collegiate circuit. After making 11 albums and EP's for independent labels, with titles like \"Locust Abortion Technician\" and \"Hairway to Steven,\" the Surfers, who are based in Austin, Tex., recently released \"Independent Worm Saloon\" on the Capitol label, showing how the rock mainstream has expanded toward the noisier fringes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930810","headline":"Horacio Gutierrez Cancels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/10/arts/horacio-gutierrez-cancels.html","abstract":"  Because of a back injury, the pianist Horacio Gutierrez has canceled his appearances with the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra tonight and tomorrow at 8 P.M. at Avery Fisher Hall.

Ms. Zaremba, who plays the show's titular heroine, is very small, even for a 9-year-old, but her voice, which is pitched somewhere between a bugle and a gym teacher's whistle, is enormous. Never mind that her diction sometimes suggests that her cheeks have been stuffed with M&M's. The kid can belt, and she seems as un-self-conscious as a kitten.   In the old-fashioned American musical, which is what \"Annie Warbucks\" frankly aspires to be, big voices out of little bodies are held dear, representing a combination of naivete and aggression that is at the very heart of the form. Innocence at high volume was, after all, what put over the original \"Annie\" -- the 1977 Broadway blockbuster inspired by the long-running comic strip \"Little Orphan Annie\" -- to which this production is a sequel. \"Annie\" was audaciously anachronistic, and after a decade of musical theater dominated by the chillier charm of Sondheim, audiences lapped up its brazen sentimentality.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930810","headline":"Serbs Make a Gesture at Sarajevo, Then Dig In Heels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/10/world/serbs-make-a-gesture-at-sarajevo-then-dig-in-heels.html","abstract":"  A melancholy smile spread across the face of a sodden Bosnian soldier standing in a forest clearing on Mount Igman today.    \"A Serbian withdrawal?\" Samir Kozar said, shaking his head so that raindrops ran in rivers down the garbage bag he was using as a poncho. \"Let me tell you: when you reporters are around, or the United Nations, the Serbs behave like babies.
