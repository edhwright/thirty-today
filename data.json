The reconstruction included adding new curbs and wooden benches. Most of the area's water mains were replaced, and new catch basins and sewers were built. * CO-OP CITY The Department of City Planning has agreed to turn the Givan Creek Woods, a 10-acre natural area north of Co-op City, into park land. The Department of Parks and many local residents had long pressed for the area's protection, but a section along Co-op City Boulevard may still be considered for commercial development. \"Maybe they can leave that alone,\" said Iris Baez, president of Co-op City's board of directors. \"They develop you to death.

The campaign has been conducted mainly below radar, through private receptions like the one in Chicago for a former welfare mother who put several children through college.    But late last month, Mr. Thomas convened a more public gathering of 35 African-Americans, including some from the black press, for three hours of off-the-record meetings at the Supreme Court. The guests were plucked from the Rolodex of the Washington talk-show host Armstrong Williams, one of Justice Thomas's closest friends.

I bet that most children never get around to opening the real book. The computer version delivers not only the illustrations and complete text, in multiple languages (want Japanese? No problem), but also a captivating soundtrack and a host of interactive distractions.   GRANDMA AND ME, by Mercer Mayer (for Macintosh and Windows; Living Books, $39.95 suggested; ages 2 to 5) was the first in the series and remains the standard-bearer of the Living Books line. The protagonist is Mr. Mayer's well-known Little Critter, an unflaggingly cute little fellow whose bloodlines apparently descend from chipmunk and woodchuck. In this episode, Critter's sprightly Grandma accompanies him on a beach outing. The story harbors very little conflict -- save a tussle with a crab -- but much charm. The viewer can choose to have the story read aloud, much as it might have been before electronic media, or watch it unfold in a more free-form style. As each virtual page appears on the screen, a voice reads the brief text (each word lights up as it is sounded), and then the real fun begins. The screen becomes a playground; almost every character and object on the screen is now a \"hot button\" for an amusing animated sequence; touch the sand castle, for instance, and a little phalanx of bugs marches out over a drawbridge.

It was Walter Becker, who played bass and guitar and left the lead vocals to his songwriting partner, Donald Fagen. On his first solo album, \"11 Tracks of Whack,\" Becker brings back everything fans cherished about Steely Dan: the desperate characters and elliptical narratives, the jazz harmonies and the ingeniously warped structures. And it turns out he has exactly the right voice for his own words: a groan that's jaded, long-suffering, cranky and shrewd. The first words Becker sings are \"In case you're wondering, it's alive and well.\"    Becker is as much an oddball now as Steely Dan was during its million-selling reign in the 1970's. On seven remarkable albums from 1972 to 1979, Steely Dan perfected stealth pop: songs in which calm tempos and suave production cloaked unlikely musical twists and lyrics about topics like stock-market crashes, Puerto Rican immigration or the golden age of be-bop. Only Paul Simon, Randy Newman and the best Brazilian songwriters showed the same musical sophistication, while Steely Dan had a terse cynicism all its own: a fascination with sleaze and duplicity that was one part hipster slumming, two parts film noir.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"Changing Roles For a Landmark","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/realestate/l-changing-roles-for-a-landmark-787108.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   It's hardly a matter requiring a correction, but I was startled by the color photo run with your Posting on Oct. 23 headed \"Changing Roles for a Landmark.\" It was a shot of the renovated Custom House, and it appeared mottled in a way suggesting perhaps brick-and-limestone construction -- which I knew was not the case.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"TAKING THE CHILDREN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/movies/taking-the-children-798487.html","abstract":"  Mary Shelley's Frankenstein  Kenneth Branagh, Robert De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter Directed by Kenneth Branagh R 128 minutes","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"Clinton Begins Pacific Visit in Manila","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/world/clinton-begins-pacific-visit-in-manila.html","abstract":"  President Clinton began a Pacific tour here this morning with somber stops to honor nearly a century of economic and security ties between the United States and the Philippines, its first colony.

Chekhov and Tolstoy clearly didn't hit it off. Neither, despite appearances, did de Gaulle and Roosevelt, or Hitler and Mussolini -- not to mention Churchill and Stalin, or J. Edgar Hoover and Emma Goldman. These 63 \"first encounters,\" which have appeared separately in The Atlantic Monthly over the past 12 years, prove how reliably fact can be stranger than fiction. Isak Dinesen and Marilyn Monroe got along fine. So did Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle. Less compatible were the more celebrated pairings of Chopin and George Sand, Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, and Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas. But their stories, illustrated in color by Edward Sorel and retold spiritedly and concisely by Nancy Caldwell Sorel (they relate their own first meeting and subsequent marriage in an afterword), all benefit from a light touch. What is the book's most memorable meeting? Possibly the one between Fats Waller and Al Capone, who kidnapped the musician for a three-day party. Equally appealing, though it relies entirely on Welles's authority, is the story of the encounter between William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles in an elevator in the Fairmont Hotel the day of the San Francisco premiere of \"Citizen Kane.\" Welles introduced himself and invited Hearst to attend, but was met with stony silence. As Hearst got off at his floor, Welles called after him: \"Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.\" DAVID WALTON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"HOME CLINIC;\nA Fine Wood Floor Is Worthy of Good Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/nyregion/home-clinic-a-fine-wood-floor-is-worthy-of-good-care.html","abstract":"A wood floor is a thing of beauty.

Painters have long supported the neutrality that the Modern represents: in the 1950's a score of prominent artists complained to the Guggenheim Museum that the sloping walls and curved ramps of Frank Lloyd Wright's spinning rotunda would fail to provide \"the rectilinear frame of reference necessary for the adequate visual contemplation of works of art.\" Wright's design, which is indeed inhospitable to some kinds of art but glorious for others, continues to fuel the deep suspicion many artists harbor toward architects.   But a growing number of architects are resisting what they regard as restrictive spaces that limit viewers to a single position in front of an object. One architect weary of what he calls the missionary position is Wolfgang Prix, who has designed -- among many other art projects -- studios for Anselm Kiefer, a painter who climbs ladders, lies prone and stands on his head to \"test\" his compositions. Two weeks ago, when Queen Beatrix opened the Groninger Museum of Art in Groningen, the Netherlands, Mr. Prix, its designer, led her on catwalks through a turbulent landscape of tilted and angled walls that afford more than one way to see a painting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941113","headline":"Building, No League, for Budig","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/sports/sports-people-baseball-building-no-league-for-budig.html","abstract":"  GENE BUDIG, who became American League president 11 days before the players went on strike, hasn't had much opportunity to make his mark on baseball, but he is still remembered and will continue to be remembered at the University of Kansas.

What orchestra in the United States, or Europe for that matter, can boast a more lustrous lineage than that?   True, by the mid-80's, under the leadership of Sergiu Comissiona, the Houston Symphony was playing indifferently and was on the verge of dropping from the top tier of regional orchestras into sheer mediocrity. But in 1988, Christoph Eschenbach, then better known as a concert pianist than as a conductor, was appointed music director, and by all accounts he has transformed the orchestra, which is said by some to be playing at the highest technical and interpretive levels of its 81-year history.

The stores contained an excellent array of goods. I bought a bronze chess set there, with figures from Greek history and myths, that is now one of my most prized possessions.

Poussin's world was that of the dramatist Pierre Corneille, not ours, and no less distant and abstract. It is steeped in arcana and the classical past. It is a world where passion usually takes a back seat to duty and honor. Poussin was the ultimate painter-philosopher, contemplative and unostentatious in his life and his work. A laborious and painstaking craftsman, he had none of the visceral swagger that we admire in the work of his 17th-century contemporaries, like Rubens, Bernini, Velazquez and Rembrandt.

I understand there is a fault line that runs under New York City. Where does it run? When was the last earthquake? Are there any predictions about the next one -- and are New York skyscrapers designed to withstand such a thing? I've heard reports that a large earthquake (over 5 on the Richter scale) is overdue for New York City. Is this true? A.  Everyone knows New York City has more than its share of faults. At least two run across upper Manhattan, one along 125th Street and another near Dyckman Street in Inwood.    The last big earthquake in the city was on Aug. 10, 1884. Equivalent to 5.5 on the Richter scale and centered under New York Harbor, it toppled hundreds of chimneys in the city and woke up chickens in western Pennsylvania. John Armbruster, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., said the next \"big one\" might not be far away. \"A magnitude 5 hits the New York area about every 100 years,\" he said. \"This is the longest period known without a magnitude 5 in New York.\"   And what might a magnitude 5, apparently 10 years overdue, do when it comes? Mr. Armbruster said the major skyscrapers in New York, including the older ones like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, have been built to withstand that kind of shock. Some other buildings however, especially those built before the age of modern construction techniques, like brownstones, might not fare as well. Unlike Los Angeles, New York City has no building regulations specifically meant to prevent earthquake damage.   Barriers of Progress   Q.  While walking my dog in Riverside Park, I've noticed very sturdy barriers -- about chest high and built from two-by-four's -- around a lot of the trees. I've seen smaller versions in dog runs and in other parks, but these are much more forbidding. Why are they there? A.  Well, it has nothing to do with your dog. The presence of these large barriers usually means that there's a capital works project somewhere in the area, said Parke Spencer, director of public information for the Parks Department. The department makes the barriers big enough to protect trees from asphalt trucks and other heavy equipment. The barriers also provide protective skirts around the bases of trees, where roots might be damaged. While they are not attractive, the department says the barriers are effective in minimizing harm to trees. And like most projects, they are temporary.  Out of (but in) Business   Q.  Has a midtown \"going out of business\" retailer ever actually gone out of business? Is there a city \"going out of business\" license, and how long is it good for? How much is the fine for having a \"going out of business\" sale without a permit? A.  A license to go out of business? In New York, yes.   The Department of Consumer Affairs issues licenses to failing businesses that give them 30 days to hold closing sales and shut up shop (with the option for two 30-day renewals). The move to begin licensing these merchants came after consumers complained about nonstop farewells, with inflated prices instead of the expected bargains. Electronics stores on Fifth Avenue in midtown were particularly blatant, said Pat Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Consumer Affairs. \"People would open with a going-out-of-business sale,\" she said.   Businesses that violate the terms of the license or restock their merchandise can be fined up to $100 a day, though Ms. Cohen admits that checking for restocking is difficult. Under a 1982 law, the Department of Consumer Affairs can close businesses that violate its permits, so long-term \"going out of business\" businesses could, eventually, find themselves closed for real. Although midtown is full of stores that are faking failure, Ms. Cohen says progress is being made. \"Word has gotten around,\" she said. \"There's fewer of these places than 10 years ago.\"   Complaints about chronic closers can be made to the Department of Consumer Affairs, (212) 487-4398.

With a four-member backing band, the Scottish brothers conjured up the ghosts of 1950's doo-wop, soul and rhythm-and-blues but substituted muscle and adrenaline for emotion and ache.   The Proclaimers might have been over and done with after they released two well-received albums in the 1980's, but when a four-year-old song of theirs, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles),\" was revived for the film \"Benny and Joon\" last year, these latter-day Everly Brothers returned.

They performed a sema, the Sufi ritual of spiritual rebirth, before a sold-out house on Friday night at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. It was a spectacle: six men dressed in white with tall camel-hair hats, with arms outstretched and long skirts twirling, accompanied by music that slowly gathered momentum, from stately extended melodies to more vigorous, more rhythmic tunes.    The white costumes represent death shrouds; the hats, tombstones. In the mystical Islam that was taught by Jalal ad-Din Rumi, sometimes known as Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273), the spinning dancers are a link between earthly existence and rapturous divine love. There was no chaos, no abandon in their ecstasy. As they whirled, the dervishes proceeded in a circle around the stage, comparable to orbiting planets, while their dancing master strolled among them. They never lost direction, collided or showed dizziness when they stopped for ceremonial bows. Yet unlike twirling ballet dancers, they moved their heads along with their bodies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"At 633 License Suspensions, The Top Scofflaw Is Arrested","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/at-633-license-suspensions-the-top-scofflaw-is-arrested.html","abstract":"  He called himself Bobby Leonard or Harvey Linen, Leroy Linden or something else, and he used various addresses, real and unreal, the police said.

Presumably the idea was that much music that did not literally use traditional tonal harmony created its tensions and resolutions with large, vaguer areas of harmonic force. Albert may have written his Second Symphony as an example. It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and received its premiere during the weekend's series of subscription concerts conducted by Hugh Wolff. Albert completed a short score before his death, indicating about half the instrumentation; a colleague, Sebastian Currier, felt very little else was required and orchestrated the piece based on his knowledge of Albert's style.   Much of Albert's previous music was inspired by literary texts, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Riverrun\" (1984). The Second Symphony, though, is a piece of absolute, abstract music. Its three movements last about a half-hour, during which there are identifiable key regions. The third -- a familiar interval in tonal music -- gives the work much of its coloration. There are even, here and there, tonal melodies that echo late Romanticism. The work is full of allusions to earlier styles, including both Mahler (in the sarcastic-sounding second movement) and Copland (in the elegiac passages of the last). The label neo-Romantic was often applied to Albert; this piece deserves to be called his Neo-Romantic Symphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/c-corrections-825328.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Saturday about a surge in the Chiron Corporation's stock price misstated the stock's trading activity on Thursday in some copies.

They say the ailing health of 90-year-old Deng Xiaoping is brewing power struggles between reformers and conservatives, just as the conflicts between the radical Gang of Four and the moderates escalated during Mao Zedong's waning days. Mr. Deng's death, this theory goes, could lead to a period of instability reminiscent of the palace coup in 1976 that resulted in the arrest and imprisonment of the Gang of Four.\n\nSuch a comparison is tempting but flawed. Mr. Deng is not Chairman Mao. He shares power with a handful of octogenarians -- some in robust health -- and he often needs to compromise on key policy and personnel issues. And for all Mr. Deng's might, his departure will not leave a power vacuum nearly as gaping as the one Mao's death created in 1976.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/sports/results-plus-865052.html","abstract":"  N.B.A.  Askew's Career High Helps Seattle Win  Vincent Askew scored 9 of his career-high 20 points in the fourth quarter yesterday as the Seattle SuperSonics defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 115-90, in Tacoma, Wash.

For the 1990's, the popular trappings include a buffer of guitars -- often distorted or discordant -- and lyrics that fracture or ignore the romantic verities of older pop. Mere melody can seem too sweet, not tough enough; fierce guitars and booming drums eliminate any wimpiness. On Saturday night at Roseland, Sugar, Velocity Girl and Magnapop were a triple bill of kindred bands, shielding tender feelings in muscular, noisy rock, skipping lead-guitar solos to get to the next riff or accusation.   Bob Mould, who leads Sugar, helped invent the style with Husker Du in the 1980's. After an interlude as a solo performer, using gentler arrangements, he returned to the power-trio lineup with Sugar. The set was a pleasurable post-punk barrage: one three-minute song leading immediately to the next, with breaks only for tuning every half a dozen songs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941114","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/14/nyregion/news-summary-819093.html","abstract":"  International A3-11  U.S. PROPOSAL ON CHINA    The United States is prepared to propose forgiving China for past violations of an international missile accord, to resolve a sticky issue, although some fear that might set a bad precedent.

There are basic, unresolved questions about the editing of his manuscripts, the chronology of his output, the validity of his recollections. And a more essential mystery shrouds his process of creation. At an Ives-centered festival presented by the Brooklyn Philharmonic last weekend, a member of the audience asked, \"How did you do it?\" The question was directed at the composer John Adams, who had orchestrated several Ives songs, but one wanted to ask it of Ives himself. How, from a chaos of secondhand material, does great music arise?   The weekend's events at the Brooklyn Academy of Music offered many fascinating insights into Ives, although it also created some new confusions. The theme was \"American Transcendentalists,\" tracing the powerful connection between Ives and the school of 19th-century idealist philosophy centered in Concord, Mass. There was a rich spread of Ives works: \"Three Places in New England,\" \"The Unanswered Question,\" various songs and shorter pieces and, naturally, the \"Concord\" Sonata. In and among them, the actor Donald Moffat read aloud selections from Emerson and Thoreau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"The Rise of a Self-Proclaimed Phenomenon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-of-a-self-proclaimed-phenomenon.html","abstract":"  VAMPS AND TRAMPS  By Camille Paglia  532 pages.

His pained, honeyed voice, with its bluesy turns and its countryish ache, fills every line with sincerity; his unhurried, deadpan delivery gives every line the air of an intimate confession. He uses his Large Band, including horns, strings and backup singers, to add small touches of down-home Americana like gospel harmonies or a Western-swing fiddle solo; it's a virtuosic group that always defers to its leader. While Mr. Lovett always comes across as sympathetic and convincing, his songs leave it up to listeners to decide what's really going on. Sometimes his narrators are genuinely affectionate or heartbroken; sometimes they're the weirdos who appear in \"Creeps Like Me.\"    At Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday night, in the first of two shows, Mr. Lovett played a generous, leisurely concert, 2 hours and 40 minutes long. For its first part, he lavished attention on songs that weren't always worth it: material from his latest, and least, album, \"I Love Everybody\" (Curb/MCA). Mr. Lovett is at the highest plateau of his career so far, after building a dedicated following and then extending his name recognition by marrying the actress Julia Roberts. But to make \"I Love Everybody,\" he dipped into his archive of early songs, and many of them are juvenalia: clever and trivial, built on one-liners (\"Penguins are so sensitive to my needs\") or easy ironies. \"Fat Babies,\" Mr. Lovett explained, was written to embarrass anyone who sang along; the audience enthusiastically joined in.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"Decking the Screen With Lots of Savers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/science/peripherals-decking-the-screen-with-lots-of-savers.html","abstract":"  DEAR Santa,    For Christmas I would like a 21-inch SVGA monitor and a one-gigabyte hard disk drive in a Pentium with 32 megs of RAM.

Federal officials are expected to announce soon whether they will declare the coho an endangered species throughout much of the Pacific Northwest. Fisheries biologists say, in fact, that most strains of Pacific salmon -- as valued a totem in this region as the bald eagle is in the nation at large -- are in deep trouble as a result of overfishing at sea, natural climatic factors and destruction of freshwater habitat where the big fish spawn and where their progeny grow large enough to return to the ocean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941115","headline":"Political Depression Hits Brunch Belt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/nyregion/political-depression-hits-brunch-belt.html","abstract":"  What did you think of the election?

Tournament   The National Collegiate Athletic Association awarded berths yesterday to 32 teams for the Division I tournament, which will start on campuses this week and conclude with the final four Dec. 9-11 at Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.   In keeping with tradition, the N.C.A.A. divided the country into eight regions for the tournament. But it reduced the minimum number of teams in each region from two to one to make room for more at-large berths.   Virginia (17-3-1) is in quest of its fourth consecutive national title and it appears that the Cavaliers are playing their best right now. Seeded second in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament that was staged over three days at Clemson, the Cavaliers captured the tournament with victories over Wake Forest, Duke and Clemson.   North Carolina-Greensboro (17-4-0) will be Virginia's opponent in the first round, which also includes four other teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference, proof that the conference is the strongest in the country.   North Carolina State (13-6-0), Duke (14-6-1), North Carolina (13-6-0) and Maryland (13-5-1) are also in the tournament, whose first round must be completed by Sunday.   St. John's (14-4-3) earned the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Big East tournament by capturing the tournament for the third consecutive year. This time, the Red Storm did it with a 1-0 triumph over Georgetown on a goal by Huey Ferguson with just under five minutes left.   Georgetown (18-3-0) was the regular-season winner in the Big East for the first time and was awarded its first tournament bid. The Hoyas were the most improved team in the league.   \"The league is getting stronger every year,\" said Dave Masur, the coach at St. John's, who took over the Red Storm three years ago and made it into a powerhouse. \"We've had 5 teams ranked in the top 20 in the country.\"   While St. John's will visit Rutgers, Georgetown will play Maryland. Georgetown was ranked 9th and St. John's 10th in the coaches' final regular-season poll, which has the first nine positions unchanged from the previous week.   Rutgers (11-4-3) is in the tournament as a result of winning the Atlantic 10 and then beating Loyola (Md.), the winner of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.   Boston University (18-0-1) finished atop the coaches' national ranking for the end of the regular season as the only undefeated team in the country. The Terriers ended the regular season with a 3-2 triumph over New Hampshire and will meet Harvard.   Harvard (5-8-2) is in the tournament because of the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Ivy League, where Brown finished with an overall record of 11-3-1. The victory over Hartwick earned Brown a bid, and the Bears will play host to New Hampshire (15-4-2) in the first round.   Indiana (19-2-0) was seeded first in the tournament and will play host to Notre Dame (12-9-2). Indiana took the Big Ten tournament with victories over Wisconsin and Penn State, who both made the tournament.   Wisconsin (14-5-0) will play at Southern Methodist (14-3-1), while Penn State (15-5-1) will meet Robert Morris (15-6-1) in a rematch from last year.   San Francisco (9-6-3) is in the tournament for the 26th time thanks to the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the West Coast Conference. The Dons, who have captured the national title four times, the last time in 1980, appeared to be out of it this season, after winning only twice in their first eight games, but they have lost only once in their last 10 games.   San Francisco will play Fresno State (17-2-1), while San Diego (13-5-0) will be at Fullerton State (12-6-2) in another West Coast match.   In other matches around the country, St. Louis (16-5-0) will play Creighton (14-4-1), Alabama-Birmingham (15-3-1) will play U.C.L.A. (15-4-0) and North Carolina-Charlotte (16-3-0) will play host to Charleston (17-6-0). Women's Division I   North Carolina is a step closer to its 12th overall title , and ninth consecutive N.C.A.A. national title. The Tar Heels reached the semifinals again with a 3-1 victory over Duke, the team that ended their undefeated streak at 101 games last month.   Connecticut (19-3-0) will provide the opposition for the Tar Heels (23-1-1) in the semifinals, which will be staged Friday at the University of Portland (Ore.). The Huskies reached the final four with tournament victories over Brown and Hartford.   Notre Dame (21-0-1), the only undefeated team in the country, will play Portland (16-5-0) in the other semifinal to decide Sunday's finalists for the championship.   Notre Dame reached the final four for the first time in its history with victories over George Mason and William and Mary, while Portland advanced by eliminating St. Mary's and Stanford.

The Steelers used a battering defense that harried Bills' quarterback Jim Kelly, who was sacked six times, jarred the ball loose from receivers and rendered Buffalo's offense completely ineffective. - Then, that same defense became a spectacular scoring machine with two great individual plays by cornerback Rod Woodson which resulted in two Steeler touchdowns. It even came up with a blocked field goal when defensive end Brentson Bruckner deflected a 32-yard attempt by Bills kicker Steve Christie with 13 minutes 54 seconds to play.   The result was a 23-10 victory for Pittsburgh (7-3), which remains a game behind Cleveland (8-2) in the American Football Conference's Central Division. The loss dropped the Bills to 5-5 and jeopardized their playoff hopes.   Kelly finished with 22 completions in 43 attempts for 212 yards. He threw one touchdown pass, but was intercepted twice.   Woodson scored on a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter. In the third quarter, he jarred the ball loose from Kelly on a sack for an eight-yard loss. The ball bounced around in the end zone and defensive end Gerald Williams fell on it for a touchdown that helped make it 23-10.   For its part, the Steelers' offense served as nothing more than a distraction until the defense could come back on the field. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Steelers offense had converted just 1 of 11 third-down attempts.   Entering the game, the Bills were in an unfamiliar position of fighting for a playoff berth.
