It seemed as if the musicians couldn't hear each other onstage, and the sound in the hall itself was disembodied and ghostlike, as if the musicians were calling in the show over the phone.   The first group to perform consisted of Red Rodney on fluegelhorn, Lee Konitz on alto saxophone, Gerry Mulligan on baritone saxophone, John Lewis on piano, Paul West on bass and Roy Haynes on drums. On \"Apple Core,\" Mr. Rodney presented a bright be-bop solo, and Mr. Mulligan flowed gently. The next tune, a blues, opened with Mr. Lewis's glacial four-choruses and distilled be-bop lyricism. Mr. Mulligan and Mr. Rodney riffed quietly and played with so much ease that the rhythm section's clumsiness could be overlooked for a minute; Mr. Konitz, who was apparently having a bad night, turned in a painfully out-of-tune improvisation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930628","headline":"Ex-Deputy Leading Field To Become Schools Chief","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/28/nyregion/ex-deputy-leading-field-to-become-schools-chief.html","abstract":"  Bernard R.

As playwrights despair over the nation's health, they increasingly look heavenward (though not necessarily to a Judeo-Christian heaven) for answers that elude them on earth. To the list of recent spiritually inclined dramas that includes \"Angels in America,\" \"Redwood Curtain\" and \"Marisol\" can now be added \"A Perfect Ganesh,\" a new play at the Manhattan Theater Club by Terrence McNally, of all unlikely people. Mr. McNally, the urbane and ferociously funny author of \"Lips Together, Teeth Apart,\" \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\" and \"The Lisbon Traviata,\" here takes a searching, if unfulfilled, journey into the mystical realms of India.   The G word in his title, which, as one line has it, \"sounds like a Jewish food,\" is in fact a reference to the Hindu god Ganesha, who is both a Puck-like character in the play (sweetly acted by Dominic Cuskern, wearing the requisite elephant's head) and a symbol of the transcendence to which Mr. McNally's two American heroines aspire. Margaret Civil (Frances Sternhagen) and Katharine Brynne (Zoe Caldwell), a pair of starchy, 60-ish best friends from Connecticut taking a two-week tour of India, have good reason to seek a new deity, especially one as happy and benevolent as Ganesha.

One doctor says, \"The system is not working.\"   The enemies are new strains of tuberculosis resistant to the antibiotics that have controlled the disease since the 1940's. When wonder drugs are not taken as prescribed -- which, in the case of tuberculosis, often means several pills in specific quantities at specific times for as long as six months -- patients may be compounding their problem.

The melody in praise of the plum blossom, for example, dates from the Chin Dynasty (265-420). The composition \"On the Grasslands\" was first published in 1818, but is attributed to a composer in the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220). These, along with the Jewish chants for reading the Bible, are the oldest documented melodies in the world, speaking of ages far distant from ours, but with voices that still have unusual and compelling power.   As played by the acclaimed pipa virtuoso Tang Liang-xing, the music's phrases were delicate and full of nuance. His style is never sentimental or exaggerated; it is always warm and dramatic. His left hand, pressing the frets on this traditional Chinese lute, bent the instrument's strings to create microtonal nuances and shaped a subtle vibrato that gave vocal character to melodic lines; his right hand, each finger equipped with a plectrum, gave the music a rhythmic crispness, articulating multiple voices in what is often considered monophonic music. In these ancient pieces, the instrument never spoke above a mezzo-piano, but it also never had to; its energy was contained by an almost ceremonial restraint.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930629","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/29/nyregion/news-summary-881193.html","abstract":"  International A3-9  EVIDENCE ON BUSH PLOT GREW  The Clinton Administration delayed its formal finding that Iraq was behind a plot to kill former President Bush until it was absolutely certain, officials said.

The annual layers of snow retrievable from the ice core contain information about weather at the time the snow fell, from which scientists can estimate the likelihood of global warming in the future. Now that the core has reached bottom, its climatic record will extend back to 250,000 years ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930630","headline":"Two Found Slain1","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/30/nyregion/two-found-slain1.html","abstract":"  Two men were found slain in an apartment they shared at 900 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the police said yesterday.

The 42-year-old former champion did what he had to do to as he tries to line up a shot at a fifth title, winning a unanimous decision over the former Canadian champion in a supermiddleweight bout. Duran (89-9) was still punching strongly in the final rounds despite an injured right hand he suffered in the fourth round. LeBlanc (22-5-2), 29, lived up to his billing as a brawler, fighting strongly into the final minute despite a bloody nose and cut under the left eye. All five of his professional losses are by decision. The victory puts Duran in position to fight the two-time world champion Vinny Pazienza in October. A victory there could put Duran in line for another title shot.
