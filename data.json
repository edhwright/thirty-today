Hostile environment harassment refers to sexual harassment so severe or pervasive as to interfere unreasonably with an individual's work performance or to create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.

States have encouraged industries to use recycled materials and expanded municipal recycling. Recyclables collected through municipal recycling increased 54 percent in New York from 1991 to 1992. New York City is the only large city in the country that requires recycling by all households. Its goal is to recycle 41 percent of the city's residential waste by the year 2000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931115","headline":"Today's TV Listings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/15/nyregion/today-s-tv-listings.html","abstract":"  Television and radio news and listings appear today on pages B12-13.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931115","headline":"Pacific Trade Bloc Is Divided Over Chile's Membership Bid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/15/world/pacific-trade-bloc-is-divided-over-chile-s-membership-bid.html","abstract":"  As the leaders of 15 Pacific nations prepare to meet this week in Seattle to debate trade and growth, another issue has split both the group and the Clinton Administration: does the Pacific Rim extend as far as Chile?

One was forced into an intersection by a speeding limousine, broke a leg and had to be destroyed.   Without very strong regulation, this industry has little to recommend it. It provides jobs for only a handful of people, and can snarl traffic and sentence horses to years of hard labor among buses, cars, honking horns and noisome exhausts. That's why the City Council in 1989 wisely voted to put the horses out to pasture, so to speak, by passing Local Law 89, which restricts the times and areas in which the carriages may operate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931116","headline":"Woolridge Signs as Free Agent With 76ers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/16/sports/sports-people-basketball-woolridge-signs-as-free-agent-with-76ers.html","abstract":"  Forward ORLANDO WOOLRIDGE has joined the Philadelphia 76ers, having signed a free-agent contract.

As Dora (Frances McDormand), a part-time nurse who lives alone on the edge of a Nebraska highway imagines it, men are born on the planet Pluto, molecularly disassembled and sent directly to Earth by radar. Their troubles arise from having to adapt to an alien ecosystem. An inability to adapt was the reason, she believes, why one of her three former husbands shot himself to death the day after they were married.    A dark comedy of the supernatural tinged with Greek myth, \"The Swan,\" which opened yesterday at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an absorbing 100-minute riff on Dora's theory. Most of all, the play, which suggests a softer, surreal response to Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love,\" is notable for a tumultuously intense performance by the Swedish actor Peter Stormare. As a man who literally falls to earth and into Dora's life, the actor, who made such a memorable Hamlet in Ingmar Bergman's touring production, gives a wrenching evocation of primal man as a lonely, wounded creature in dire need of nurturing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931116","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/16/nyregion/news-summary-110793.html","abstract":"  International A3-16  IRAQ ATTACKING MARSH AREA  Iraq has been stepping up attacks on the opposition Shiite Muslims in its southern marsh areas, residents say, wiping out villages and farms and pushing families over the border and into detention camps.

The finesse loses to the queen, and you have to find a way to defeat the contract.   This deal was created for an English par contest more than half a century ago, and East was supposed to find a clever defense: Lead the club five at the third trick.

The foundation is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by Edward Hayes, formerly the lawyer for the Warhol estate, whose fee for his legal work he has maintained should be determined by the worth of the holdings. The foundation had argued that releasing information about its holdings would reduce their value in the marketplace and therefore diminish the foundation's ability to sell its Warhols at top price to provide the maximum funds for its grants.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931117","headline":"1943:Yugoslavs in Sortie : IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/opinion/IHT-1943yugoslavs-in-sortie-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, ALGIERS - [From our New York edition:] Yugoslav pilots trained in the United States began flying combat missions alongside American flyers yesterday [Nov. 15] when a force of Liberator bombers attacked the Eleusis airfield at Athens,","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931117","headline":"Curbs Approved For Custodians In Public Schools","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/17/nyregion/curbs-approved-for-custodians-in-public-schools.html","abstract":"  The State Assembly gave final approval today to a bill aimed at ending years of fraud and misconduct by New York City's school custodians by giving principals and the city's Board of Education a degree of control over their work for the first time.

Mother, who is played with monumental stoicism by the great Sada Thompson, knows everything, actually, since she is cursed with the power of clairvoyance. And judging by the pained, steely mask in which Ms. Thompson sets her face for much of her performance, her character has seen in her family's future, to borrow from a Gershwin song, \"more clouds of gray than any Russian play could guarantee.\"   \"Any Given Day,\" which is set in an oppressively formal, down-at-the-heels middle-class Bronx apartment in the early 1940's, most immediately evokes the corrosive family portraits that dominated American drama in the middle of this century. The play, at the Longacre Theater, also seems to be Mr. Gilroy's bid to write something like a Chekhovian tragicomedy of withering expectations.
