By midspring, however, just as the leaves are budding and flowers poking their heads above ground, festivals reappear. Communities large and small hope to attract tourists, and since Europe is a cultured place, what better lure than the arts? By late spring, festivals are in full bloom, and quite naturally the highlights of the musical calendar tend to coincide with them.    Salzburg, that picture-perfect Austrian Alpine city, is best known for its venerable summer festival of music and theater in late July and August, when the mountain meadows are lush and green and the temperatures downright balmy. But in 1967, the conductor Herbert von Karajan started a Salzburg Easter Festival, which turned out to be an Alpine foothold for the Berlin Philharmonic (the Vienna Philharmonic has traditionally been the principal orchestra at the summer festival). Claudio Abbado, the new principal conductor of the Berlin orchestra, is now also the mainstay of the Easter event.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"He's No. 1","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/books/he-s-no-1.html","abstract":"  THE HOUSE THAT ROONE BUILT The Inside Story of ABC News.

Len raised me from age 8 and, during my childhood, he would periodically vanish on what he called \"secret missions.\" At 6 feet 6 inches, tiptoeing on his size 13 shoes, Len's personal aura seemed to combine Sam Spade with Len's own lifelong hero, Abraham Lincoln.   \"There's a matter of national importance that must command my attention,\" Len would say as he departed. He was famous, in our family, for his secrecy and style of traveling light. He carried only a manila envelope. Everything else, including his shoes, would be mailed ahead to the \"undisclosed location,\" and then returned in a sturdy metal mailing box that looked as if it might really contain what Len implied were classified materials. When I was 10, I was sure Len was a world-class spy, or some sort of government agent. At some point in my teens, I peeked into the \"classified\" file and found only a clean change of underwear and rolled socks. I began to suspect he hadn't truly traveled abroad on a matter of international diplomacy but had taken a weekend flyer with his girlfriend.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"CHINA REJECTS CALL FROM CHRISTOPHER FOR RIGHTS GAINS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/world/china-rejects-call-from-christopher-for-rights-gains.html","abstract":"  Chinese officials today flatly rejected Secretary of State Warren Christopher's demand that Beijing improve its human rights performance and warned that stripping China of its trade privileges would backfire.

Though some of the contributors don't always deliver, the show early on achieves a momentum of good feeling that carries the performance aloft and safely keeps it there.    As much as anything else, \"Damn Yankees\" is a salute to that most resilient of Broadway wizards, the 106-year-old George Abbott, who directed the original production and collaborated on its book.

It was easy to say where one would hear techno: at raves, where the music combined with psychedelic lights and strobes to induce the ultimate trance-dance experience. But today, techno means atmospheric chill-out music designed for home listening as often as it does party music. There are even techno clubs where people sip tea rather than take Ecstacy and lull about on mattresses rather than leaping about on the dance floor.    Rave music has spread from Britain and Europe -- where it is still the dominant strand of pop culture -- to Japan, Australia and America, albeit as an underground phenomenon. Yet when a pop movement reaches such global proportions, it tends to split apart. Just as is happening in rap, techno is splintering into a profusion of subgenres. But if there's a basic schism, it's between \"progressives\" who want techno to evolve from a style geared to 12-inch singles into an album-based art form and \"hard-core\" fundamentalists who admire the music's origin as the soundtrack to nonstop ecstatic dancing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"Big Sur","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/travel/l-big-sur-424170.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Susan Spano provides a feast of useful tidbits for the frugal traveler in Big Sur, a part of the country that has been on my itinerary back-burner for some time.

Anthony Harvey -- as actor, editor and director -- started at the top.    In his first acting role, at 14, he co-starred with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains. When he took up film editing, he was soon cutting classics like Stanley Kubrick's \"Dr. Strangelove\" and Martin Ritt's \"Spy Who Came in From the Cold.\"    On Mr. Harvey's first time as director of a full-length film, \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968), he won the Directors Guild of America award.   Part of the reason for his vaulting to success is that Mr. Harvey, 62, of Water Mill, attracts talent like a trampoline does tumblers. The cast of sterling actors he has directed includes George C. Scott, Joanne Woodward, Liv Ullmann, Anthony Hopkins and Glenda Jackson.   A recurring element through his career is his work with Katharine Hepburn. She has appeared in four of his projects, winning an Academy Award for Best Actress for \"The Lion in Winter\" and starring in the Emmy-winning \"Glass Menagerie\" (1973).   \"Tony is a brilliant director who has a wonderful sense of the medium of film because of his training,\" Miss Hepburn said in a phone interview.  \"He has real imagination. He's one of the best directors I've ever worked with.\" That praise comes from an actress who has worked with Howard Hawks, John Huston, John Ford, George Cukor and Frank Capra.   In his most recent effort, Mr. Harvey once again directed Miss Hepburn, paired with Anthony Quinn in a romantic comedy called \"This Can't Be Love.\" CBS-TV will broadcast the made-for-television film tonight at 9 o'clock. 'Baptism by Fire'    Mr. Harvey was born to the boards in London. His stepfather, Morris Harvey, was an actor who wrote revues for Gertrude Lawrence. At 5, Mr. Harvey saw his first play with Jessica Tandy as the ingenue. He recalls watching a stellar season of Lawrence Olivier and Ralph Richardson at the Old Vic.   His stepfather's acquaintance with Ms. Leigh won Mr. Harvey an audition for the role of Ptolemy in a film of George Bernard Shaw's \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1946). Playing opposite Leigh and Rains \"was a marvelous baptism by fire,\" Mr. Harvey said. Almost literally by fire, because the film studio was bombed in the blitz, which caused filming to be suspended. When Mr. Harvey returned the next year to shoot his battle scenes, he had outgrown his costume and had to be filmed in close-up, from the neck up.   He studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. \"I realized very soon that I wasn't going to be an Albert Finney and quickly got out of it,\" he said.   Mr. Harvey achieved his next break by haunting studio gates until he cornered John and Roy Boulting, two well-known film makers, and persuaded them to hire him as an assistant editor. After a year of gluing together film with cement, he became chief editor on hit films like \"I'm All Right, Jack,\" starring Peter Sellers and Richard Attenborough. 'Peter Sellers of the Cutting Room'    After editing \"Lolita\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\" for Mr. Kubrick, Mr. Harvey had become such a perfectionist that he knew it was time to move on. Mr. Kubrick told him, \"I think you're becoming the Peter Sellers of the cutting room,\" and encouraged him to direct.   Paradoxically, Mr. Harvey's films are not tour de forces of cinematic cross-cuts. He eschews bouncing from shot to shot like a ball at a tennis match, MTV-style. Stillness and simplicity characterize his approach. A virtuoso cutter, he understood the virtue of not cutting away to another actor's reaction shot. \"If an actor is giving a dazzling performance, hold on to that shot,\" Mr. Kubrick had advised him.   Mr. Harvey based his first short film in 1966 on a play by Leroi Jones, now Amiri Baraka, \"Dutchman,\" about murder on the subway. Made in six days on a budget of $20,000, the film was critically acclaimed. Shirley Knight won the Golden Lion Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival for her work in it.   When Peter O'Toole saw \"Dutchman,\" he knew that Mr. Harvey, despite his inexperience with features, was right for \"The Lion in Winter.\" The director's knees trembled at the prospect. \"I was absolutely panic stricken,\" Mr. Harvey recalled. To impress Miss Hepburn, he sent her roses, an unfortunate choice. \"These are the most dreadful flowers I've ever seen,\" the actress told him. \"They've got wires in them.\"    In rehearsals Mr. Harvey was so awe struck that he deferentially called the star Miss Hepburn. \"How can I call the woman I've worshiped all my life just plain Kate? I have to show respect!\"   The film, set in the 12th century, featured Ms. Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine, who squabbles with her estranged husband, Henry II, played by Mr. O'Toole. Miss Hepburn delivered memorable lines like, \"Hush, dear, mother's fighting.\" The royal family is fraught with sufficient treason, patricide, incest and sodomy to satisfy the most vulturish tabloid. \"What family doesn't have its ups and downs?\" Ms. Hepburn asks. Ready to Go Overboard    Mr. Harvey gave his idol one of the grandest entrances in film history, floating upstream in a barge. Dressed in sumptuous robes, Miss Hepburn seems incandescent, as glints of light irradiate the scene like an illuminated manuscript.   What is not evident is that the scene was shot at high tide as wild winds buffeted the boat. Persuaded that it would founder, Miss Hepburn advised an armor-clad actor to unbuckle his breastplate. She planned to jettison her heavy gown and swim naked to shore.   Mr. Harvey was elated with Miss Hepburn's performance. \"Working with her is like going to Paris at the age of 17 and finding everything is the way you thought it would be,\" he said at the time. Miss Hepburn made an exception to her practice of not seeing her films. She screened \"Lion\" in the office of the producer Joseph Levine, bursting into tears of relief at the end.   The movie became a critical and commercial hit, winning the New York Critics Award as Best Film. Mr. Harvey was thrust overnight into the spotlight. \"It was a thrilling start,\" he said. \"But when you have success so early everything after that is under great scrutiny. You wonder what the hell to do next.\"   Retreating from the public glare, he turned down many offers, including \"Cabaret\" and \"Love Story.\" \"I let them go out of total indecision,\" he recounted. \"It was a terrible mistake.\"    After a series of mostly forgotten films for major studios, Mr. Harvey's most visible project was an adaptation of Tennessee Williams's \"Glass Menagerie\" for ABC-TV. He wanted Miss Hepburn for the lead, but she was at first reluctant after Laurette Taylor's sensational portrayal on stage. Miss Hepburn had gone with Spencer Tracy to see the play five nights in a row. She told Mr. Harvey that the soles of her feet were bleeding from the intensity of the experience.   Their next film together, \"The Ultimate Solution of Grace Quigley\" (1983), was a black comedy in which Miss Hepburn played a woman who hired a hit man (Nick Nolte) to put her aged friends out of their misery. When it was released in the United States, it was a resounding flop.    Mr. Harvey attributed the failure to Cannon Films's recutting the picture to contrive an upbeat ending.  Bitterly disappointed, the director licked his wounds. \"I needed to go to a rest home, which I practically did for six years,\" Mr. Harvey said. Unable to muster the spirit to work, \"I wasted those years.\"    Besides Miss Hepburn, Mr. Harvey has worked with other major actresses like Bette Davis and Faye Dunaway in \"The Disappearance of Aimee,\" a 1976 made-for-television film. Davis, in her late 70's, \"absolutely took a dislike to Faye Dunaway,\" Mr. Harvey recalled.   \"I would line them up for a two-shot,\" he said, \"then look through the camera, and I couldn't see Bette.\" Each time, she inched her chair away to evade a tete-a-tete with the younger actress.   Mr. Harvey's latest project arose from his desire to capture Miss Hepburn doing what she has always done best. Among her most memorable films are the dueling-duo movies like \"Adam's Rib\" with Tracy.   \"Kate is always marvelous when she's up against a macho actor,\" Mr.  Harvey said. \"Whether it's John Wayne or Spencer Tracy or Bogie, the chemistry with those actors brings out her best.\"   In \"This Can't Be Love,\" Mr. Quinn plays a hammy hero against whom the flinty Miss Hepburn, at the age of 86, strikes sparks. \"Kate is unique with this great courage and her wonderful sense of being able to laugh at herself,\" Mr. Harvey said.    In her 50th film in a career of 62 years Ms. Hepburn shows the difference between merely going long and clearly going strong. In \"The African Queen\" her character told Bogart loftily, \"Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put into this world to rise above.\" In her latest film, she rises above frailty in a portrayal of a tough woman rejuvenated by romance. \"I feel 70 again!\" she says in the role.   Miss Hepburn felt so sprightly during the filming that she was always first on the set. Once, when Mr. Harvey arrived tardy, she whacked him with her cane, saying, \"You've kept me waiting!\" He disappeared briefly, returning with a bandage spotted with fake blood swathing his head.   Mr. Harvey criticized the trend to inane movie sequels. As Tracy described Hepburn's character, using a Brooklyn accent in \"Pat and Mike\": \"She ain't got much meat on her, but what she's got is cherce.\"    Mr. Harvey, too, prefers quality to quantity. \"It's important to try and do something different and not repeat oneself,\" he said. \"One should take risks and break all the rules.\" What about the producer? \"To hell with him,\" he declared. \"The thing is to make a film one enjoys and feels passionate about.    \"I try to make films that are uplifting. One has to have hope for the human race and love and the feeling that life can be wonderful.\" Anxious Anesthesiologist    Mr. Harvey finds the wonderful life not in California, but in living on the East End. He told an anecdote about having major surgery in a hospital in Los Angeles. \"As I was coming to, the anesthesiologist said, 'I'm very anxious to get into movies.' \"    \"Only in Hollywood!\" Mr. Harvey exclaimed. \"It's so ridiculous. You couldn't put it into a movie.\"   His life in Water Mill, where he moved three years ago from Manhattan, consists of taking long walks by the sea with his golden retriever, Rufus. \"I grew up in the country, and I'm a passionate gardener,\" the director said. The view from his art-stuffed house is of fields, a lake and wild geese flying over in chevron formation.   Mr. Harvey is planning his next project, a film with Mr. Quinn based on the last years of Tolstoy's life. He would love to make a comedy like Laurel and Hardy's movies, \"screamingly funny films,\" he said, \"where you roar with laughter till tears pour down your face.\"   \"If you don't have a sense of humor about yourself you're doomed,\" Mr.  Harvey said. \"That's why I was silly to get into a depression over that last film. You can't sit around feeling sorry for yourself. You have to say, 'Onwards.' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"Gold Rush Fever Grips Capital As Health Care Struggle Begins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/us/gold-rush-fever-grips-capital-as-health-care-struggle-begins.html","abstract":"  Ordinarily, a tax bill is as big as it gets for the lobbyists, public-relations specialists, direct-mail wizards, pollsters, consultants and assorted other players in the political industrial complex of the nation's capital.

Had the spirit of Verdi come back to life, after smoldering for several decades in the subconscious of Strauss and Berg? Such are the dangers of vastly exceeding all expectations. No subsequent Britten opera quite matched the fearless dramatic assurance of \"Grimes,\" and a degree of disappointment set in. It became a commonplace to say that England's boy wonder never fulfilled his early promise.   Recordings tell the tale of Britten's reputation. The composer directed all but two of his operas for London, and then an ominous silence fell. The only conductor to enter the field was Colin Davis, directing \"Peter Grimes\" and \"The Turn of the Screw\" for Philips. Then, in 1987, Virgin Classics issued the wonderful W. H. Auden operetta \"Paul Bunyan,\" and in the last year three new efforts have arrived: a \"Grimes\" on EMI, a \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" on Virgin Classics and a first recording of \"Gloriana\" on Argo, filling the last major gap in the Britten catalogue.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"Mayor's Response On School Vouchers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/nyregion/l-mayor-s-response-on-school-vouchers-447153.html","abstract":"  I would like to respond to Elizabeth DiSavino's Feb. 6 letter to the New Jersey editor, which says that school voucher programs are \"unequivocally unconstitutional.\"   I agree that direct government support of religious instruction in our schools is a violation of the First Amendment.

Wednesdays to Saturdays 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sundays 2 to 4:30. Except holidays. To April 10. \n\nBy calling attention to art as a process of successively layered elements, this 12-artist show seems smart and focused. It offers some engaging pieces, although the primary contribution is the scope it suggests for the theme.\n\nIn terms of scale, for example, the range is from Sharon Ligorner's tiny fantasy-fish images, which are transformed by collage and presented on matchbooks, to Jean-Marie Martin's seven-foot \"East River,\" which places simulated and real elements, including a light fixture, in a large mock gold frame to suggest a landscape and to symbolize the preciousness of light, air, earth and water. \n\nWith regard to materials and their interpretations, the approaches cover a broad span, too, ranging from Keith Long's reliance on a single medium, recycled-wood fragments, to Charlotte Brown's evocative, sometimes sensuous, combinations of a dozen or more ingredients, including handmade paper, collage, thread, glass and Mylar, which become incongruous yet beautifully mysterious boxes holding objects that have the resonance of private memories. \n\nWhen independent, conceptual or semiconceptual ideas are part of what is layered into the construction, the results can be particularly effective. Ellen Sullivan's small iconic pieces might involve just three cylindrical jars. But when one in the sequence is swaddled in old gauze or caked with cracking paint, their sense of relevance to both past and present helps make the assemblage strangely and hauntingly powerful. \n\nCamille Caggiano's appealing assemblages fabricate a small intricately detailed setting by using bits and pieces of plastic figures, beads and cutouts. Filled with rich puns and double meanings, they are absurd but timely. \n\nMore somber messages, including philosophical musings about death are woven into Louise Weinberg's brightly colored constructions. One of her best pieces is a windowless house bearing the sign \"Fetish for Obsessive Love.\" \n\nPhotography has enormous potential for leading the mind toward layered sequences of images. Examples by Stanislaus Dubowski, Paul Glorioso and Annette Merlis hint at that in different ways. Mr. Dubowski's chromogenic color composites present the illogical, but are the most straighforward. His \"Wading River\" creates a vertical stack of the same plate of fruit seen from four distinct angles to give the impression of shifting viewing positions on the part of the observer. \n\nThe conceptual challenges are more subtle in Ms. Merlis's \"Omen,\" which superimposes a nearly abstract skyscape photograph over a chalky, vigorously brushed, loosely interpreted landscape. One element is a record, the other a suggestion.  Greatly enlarged antique portrait photographs personalize Mr. Glorioso's largest assemblage, which is constructed from old weathered windows and other components that conjure a dwelling. Some of the three-dimensional additions can be as delicate as a candle or a vase of flowers, and those tend to give the sculpture the appearance of an altar honoring nostalgia. \n\nCollage is the starting point for Suzan Jivan, who combines color illustrations of famous paintings with those from product advertising, and for Kathy Frey, whose ordered patterns of common debris offer a certain social content. \nModern Meets the Masses: 1910-1920\n The Parrish Art Museum, 25 Jobs La., Southampton. Mondays and Thursdays through Saturdays 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.  and Sundays 1 to 5. To April 10. \n\nIn the museum world there is a trend toward developing exhibitions that relate art to a broader context.  This second effort in a collaborative program between the Parrish and the Southampton School District is in that vein, and the students, working with an advisory panel, have produced a show with many elements that should be crowd pleasers.\n\nIncluded are Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett and D. W. Griffiths films, jazz highlights that can be selected from a computer and early motoring costumes on loan from the Bridgehampton Historical Society. \n\nAnother local spin, and a strong touch, is a section devoted to the World War I history of Camp Upton in Yaphank. The best of the art borrowed from other institutions includes George Bellows's wonderful circus painting, very good pieces by Stanton MacDonald Wright and Marguerite Zorach and Marcel Duchamp's \"Boite en Valise.\" \n\nThe central theme of the exhibition deals with the arrival of modern-art styles in this country and the transition from traditional modes to the more avant-garde. The established art history is taken quite seriously.\n\nExamples of the 19th-century idyllic pastoral attitudes are present to contrast with the change in subject matter shown by John Sloan's seamy tenement scenes and the change in style revealed by the exuberant and fragmented sea and cityscapes by John Marin. In portraiture, too, one can see the transition from conventional approaches to the simplified expressive linear treatments of Eli Nadelman and Abraham Walkowitz. \n\nCentral to the art story is the impact of the 1913 Armory Show. To suggest the weight of that event, which introduced the work of many major Europeans to the United States, as many of the right people as possible have been included, like Braque, Cezanne and Gauguin, even if they could be represented by just a small etching or lithograph. The Braque, nevertheless, demonstrates the innovative Cubist surface faceting, while the Gauguin nicely shows the artist's flattened, synthesized forms. \n\nIt is good to see how the examination of a specific period will provide an opportunity to reconsider noteworthy work by artists who are now footnotes to history. Such is the case with Robert W. Chanler's oil-on-glass study for one of his eight screens that decorated the entrance to the Armory Show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"Feminist vs. Feminist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/books/l-feminist-vs-feminist-423890.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Democrats disagree about the North American Free Trade Agreement; it's a discussion.

Akmal Parwez, originally from Pakistan, will offer his \"Kalpana.\" Serge Suny has been inspired by his Armenian background, and Hale Smith, a black composer, will contribute a song cycle based on Raymond Patterson's poems. Works by Herbert Rothgarber and Kent Marks complete the program. \n\nThe library is on Davison Avenue (766-2360).\nFROM THE CHAMBERS\n\n What with two local ensembles performing and three groups visiting, chamber-music devotees can sample deeply this week. \n\nFor Morton Gould's 80th birthday, and with the composer in the audience, the American Chamber Ensemble will present a program at 3 P.M. today that includes Mr. Gould's \"Concerto Concertante.\" It is in the Monroe Hall Theater at Hofstra in Hempstead (463-6644).\n\nAt 7:30 in South Side Middle School on Hillside Avenue in Rockville Centre the Sea Cliff Chamber Players will perform works by Beethoven, Messiaen and Sarasate. The concert will be preceded by a talk on music at 6:45 (671-6263).\n\nOn Wednesday at 8 P.M. the Colorado String Quartet, a female ensemble, will play pieces by Beethoven, Piston and Smetana in the Staller Center at Stony Brook (632-7230). On Thursday, also at 8, the Verdi Quartet, a new German group, will offer works by Haydn, Kodaly, Wolf and Smetana in Berkner Hall at the Brookhaven National Laboratory off Floyd Parkway in Upton (282-2345). \n\nThe Empire Brass is offering music by Bach, Bernstein, Borodin, Copland, Purcell and Tchaikovsky at 8 P.M. on Saturday in the Sayville Middle School on Johnson Avenue (224-5420).\nOPERA SAMPLING\n\n Opera lovers can find the tried-and-true as well as the new this week. \n\nThe \"new\" is on Friday and Saturday, when the University at Stony Brook Opera Ensemble presents \"Postcard From Morocco.\" With music by Dominick Argento and text by John Donahue, the comic work tells what transpires when seven railway passengers have have to disembark at a border crossing. The performances are at 8 P.M. in the Staller Center (632-7230).\n\n\"La Boheme\" is the latest classic to be presented by the National Grand Opera. The company will tell all about Rodolfo and Mimi at 8 P.M. on Saturday in Tilles Center (246-1040).\nTO THE POINT\n\n The varied terrain of Montauk will be highlighted on Saturday, when the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference holds an all-day walk exploring moors, ponds, swamps and beaches. Hikers carrying their own lunches should meet at 9:30 A.M. in the parking lot of Montauk County Park off Montauk Highway (345-5295).\nSYMPHONY GOES POPS\n\n The Symphony of Long Island puts aside its classical repertory to explore musical comedy. Under the baton of Don Pippin and with Marie Barbara Santella as singer the orchestra will perform \"A Broadway Extravaganza\" at 8 P.M. on Saturday in the Adams Playhouse at Hofstra (481-3100).\n'LADIES WHO SWING'\n\n Jazz is increasingly opening up for women. Instrumentalists and singers will join forces on Saturday in \"Ladies Who Swing and Sing\" at the State University in Old Westbury.\n\nThe lineup includes String of Pearls, a trio that specializes in arrangements from the 30's, 40's and 50's. Its members are Susan Halloran, Holli Ross and Jeanne O'Connor. They will be backed by Sherrie Maricle, drummer; Janice Friedman, pianist; Marianne McSweeny, bassist, and Virginia Mayhew, saxophonist. This quartet is drawn from Diva, the 15-piece all-female band.\n\nThe concert, presented by Time for Music, is at 8:15 P.M. in the Recital Hall (679-2646).\nBARBARA DELATINER","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"An Icelandic Sinner Thaws Out","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/books/an-icelandic-sinner-thaws-out.html","abstract":"ABSOLUTION\nBy Olafur Johann Olafsson.\n259 pp. New York:\nPantheon Books. $20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"In the Region/Westchester; Dealing With a Severe Winter's Damage to Homes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-dealing-with-a-severe-winter-s-damage-to-homes.html","abstract":"  AS elsewhere in the Northeast, homes in Westchester County, both vacant and occupied, have taken a terrible beating this winter as a result of the succession of snowstorms and extremely low temperatures.   \"We had a deal on one house,\" said Dorothy Mertz, a broker associate with the Prudential Ragette Realtors in Eastchester, \"and when the termite inspector went there he found it was completely flooded.\" It was so bad, Ms. Mertz said, that the floors throughout the house were warped and \"rose up in a V shape.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"A Winter of Disaster Leaves the Bills to Prove It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/us/a-winter-of-disaster-leaves-the-bills-to-prove-it.html","abstract":"  It wasn't a hurricane or an earthquake, but the winter of 1993-94, which is now entering its final full calendar week, has become a disaster of its own sort, leaving a trail of damage, hardship and bitter memories whose effects will be felt for years in the eastern half of the United States.

In 1966, after Mr. Saarinen's death, the firm became Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates. \n\nMr. Roche's projects, most of them large corporate and civic works like the Ford Foundation Building and the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City, have taken him around the world. His designs in Connecticut include the Creative Arts Center at Wesleyan University, Union Carbide's world headquarters in Danbury, the Aetna computer headquarters in Hartford and the Knights of Columbus Building in New Haven. \n\nIn an interview in his Hamden office recently, Mr. Roche talked about his work. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. \n\nQ. Has your Irish heritage influenced your sense of design? \n\nA. Of course. Ireland does have a fairly rich architecture tradition from the British occupancy. I received my architectural education there also. I knew right from the very start what I wanted to be even though I'd never met an architect. I felt I wanted to build things. \n\n Q. You have said that architects should be committed to serving the community, the whole culture. Could you elaborate on that? \n\nA. I was really speaking to a specific kind of problem which emanates from the manner in which architects tended to be educated, with the idea that they were all great geniuses and they were all independent from any kind of criticism, but they were, as an artist might be, totally self-dependent for their inspiration. And really, architecture is not art; it's architecture, and it carries with it many burdens and responsibilities not the least of which is that everything we do affects the community. \n\n Q. Can anyone argue with that? \n\nA. Everyone agrees with this but it's difficult to start thinking in those terms. It may be a simple functional problem with resolving a series of problematic requirements for a strong-willed client, and you struggle to make something that's esthetically satisfying, that comes together in some way. \n\n Q. I read somewhere that while Saarinen had Romantic tendencies, Roche was a more rational designer. Do you agree?\n\nA. I suppose I do. I tend to be rather simple in my assembly of things, and I tend to take very much into account the resolving of the problematic issues. And not burdening the client. And I believe that architecture really begins on the inside and works its way to the outside. And in doing that, you not only save a great deal of time and money, but you come up with better architecture. \n\n Q. Looking at slides of your projects, I was struck by the fact that while there is often interior landscaping, they do not bear a recognizable trademark as some buildings do. \n\nA. That's because we start at the sense of responsibility to the community and the user. So I'm willing to look at that always with a fresh eye and say, \"What is the appropriate thing to do here?\" \n\n Q. Do you carry on Saarinen's philosophy in this? \n\nA. It's tended to be the same thing. He was very inventive in his own way, and he did look at problems with an original eye and he was always searching for other answers. Mies van der Rohe was fond of the universal solution; he believed you could make a universal building, such as the National Gallery in Berlin, into which you then could put anything. \n\n Q. I happen to really like the Knights of Columbus Building in New Haven, but many people do not. What did you envision with that design? \n\nA. You know, it's really interesting. That building is enormously popular in Europe -- in Spain, in Italy. I was just stunned to realize how important it was to a whole generation of architects. They just sort of attached themselves to that, because it's a strong building, a very strong form. \n\nYou have to put it in perspective with the moment in time that it happened, around 1964. The Oak Street connector had just been put through and it became the new entry into the \"new\" New Haven. If you deal in those terms, and also, in the sense that gateways mark the entry into Medieval cities, it's that kind of idea, a symbol. \n\nWe took some of the core elements such as the stairs and the toilets and put them in the corners and then used those as the structural elements. And we were interested in combining the two structural materials -- concrete, which was used for bearing, and steel, which was used for spanning. We were able to devise a method, satisfactory to the fire codes, of not covering up the steel. This is one of the few buildings in the world that has its main structure of steel exposed. \n\nSubsequently the building was given many different symbolic interpretations which were very far from my mind. You always hit that in any strong building -- supporters and detractors. It's a very successful building. They're happy with it. \n\n Q. Whose judgment do you value most -- a user's, a critic's or the public's?\n\nA. Of course it's ideal if all three like it. But that's an improbable circumstance. For me it's the user, because it's built for using. \n\n Q. Do you ever look at your buildings and think, \"Oh, this proportion could have been better\" or \"That material looks dated\"?\n\nA. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. \n\n Q. You've designed four large houses, and you talk about an architect's responsibility. Have you ever been interested in saving our landscape by designing small homes for ordinary people?\n\nA. Well, the problem is that it takes so much time and effort to do a house and so much personal involvement.  It's not that the small house isn't an interesting problem. It's a tough problem. I feel comfortable doing office buildings because I feel that I know what works and what doesn't work for people.\n\nIn doing a particular house I can get to know the people well and I go through their laundry and their number of shoes and how they live and cook, and what their habits are. But if you're building houses for an unknown occupant you have to generalize and that's the thing that makes me feel a little uncomfortable.\n\n Q. But shouldn't architects encourage good design for the masses?\n\nA. Of course. We're confronted with a terrible dilemma in this suburban sprawl, which is very destructive of a whole national environment. It's not a supportable way to keep going. What we need to do is train ourselves to make a different ideal.\n\n Q. What is your own home like?\n\nA. I live in a 100-year-old stone house that was Eli Whitney's stable. It was converted in the 20's into a house. \n\nQ. It amazes me how many architects live in older houses. Didn't you want to start from scratch?\n\nA. Well, my wife found this place and we like it. That was one reason. The other reason was I didn't want to get divorced. Building a house is a very traumatic experience. In fact, when we did some reconstruction on ours several summers ago, I hired an architect.\n\n Q. Where can architecture go next? Will there be dramatic changes?\n\nA. Yes. For quite a number of reasons. One is the technological development, ways of building, for waste disposal, for maintaining temperature, plus development of materials. In addition, the cost of building, largely material and labor, is getting more and more expensive. The hours that you can afford to spend on something will have to be reduced.\n\nThe other thing is the political and cultural changes, which come about with increasing frequency. All will have an effect on what happens in our profession. Because architecture is part of cultural change, it's part of the whole living environment.\n\nChanges we will surely have, and we cannot predict them.\n\n Q. What projects to you have in the works now?\n\nA. We are still working at the Metropolitan Museum, doing some Chinese galleries. We have a rather large project under way in Singapore, one in Kuala Lumpur and one in Tokyo. We're working on a Holocaust museum for Lower Manhattan which I hope will get under way this year. We finished five corporate headquarters last year.\n\n Q. What would you like most to be remembered for?\n\nA. I have five children, and I want them to think of me fondly. The most rewarding thing is the family. I think it's very foolish and lacking in wisdom to have ecumenical aspirations. Time levels all of that very quickly. If you have any sense of history, any perspective, you don't consider them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"In the Region/ New Jersey;\nA Performing-Arts Center for Camden's Waterfront","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/realestate/in-the-region-new-jersey-a-performingarts-center-for-camdens.html","abstract":"LIKE the rest of Camden's mostly idle Delaware River waterfront, a symbol of this city's faded industrial past, a gritty 13-acre patch in its southern half has long been awaiting new life.

Mr. Williams, who was born in Australia in 1941, moved to London when he was 10 and studied with Andres Segovia. Segovia virtually anointed Mr. Williams his successor (to the chagrin of Julian Bream, who was a few years older and already finding his own post-Segovia path), and for a time Mr. Williams did everything expected of a Segovia disciple. He made his way through the standard repertory and produced recordings that were stunning for their virtuosity and technical precision.

Gillian B. Anderson, who discovered the music in Chaplin's archives and conducted the performance, identified many of the melodies Chaplin and his musical collaborator, Arthur Kay, linked to the images. Prominent among them, were quotations from Bizet's \"Carmen\" and Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci.\"   The allusion to the Leoncavallo opera was appropriate. The Tramp in the movie resembles not only the opera's Tonio, who plays a clown in a traveling dramatic troupe and is hopelessly in love with Nedda, but also Canio, Nedda's husband, who is betrayed by her. Venality, however, is replaced by nobility, tragedy by sentimentality; the hobo, unrequited in love, steps aside for the sake of the woman's happiness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940313","headline":"Hampton, a Town Where Crime Stays on Holiday","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/nyregion/hampton-a-town-where-crime-stays-on-holiday.html","abstract":"  THE town of Hampton, tucked away in the hills of Eastern Connecticut, is one of the state's lesser-known assets.

Robert who? Nobody would have asked that question 30 years ago, when Mr. Stephens seemed the most talented of the young men gracing the newly formed National Theater and was even regarded as Laurence Olivier's natural heir at the head of the acting trade. But he gradually faded, the victim of serious personal problems. But in 1991, almost out of the blue, the Royal Shakespeare Company cast him as Falstaff in \"Henry IV,\" and he rose to the challenge, creating a fat knight who roistered and gourmandised with the best of them but was most himself when ruefully contemplating his own self-indulgent, half-wasted life.

His long career began with the avant-garde movement that emerged, along with the Republic of Czechoslovakia, at the close of World War I. As the 237 reproductions in JOSEF SUDEK (Takarajima/Distributed Arts Publishers, $125) make clear, the photographer's work reflects little of the social and political turmoil endured by his homeland. His romantic, ironic and occasionally surreal images are rooted instead in art and music. Lugging heavy tripods and cameras over his shoulder, manipulating equipment, film and cloth with one hand, he found sustenance for his vision on his native ground -- in Prague, the Bohemian countryside, his cramped studio -- and never left Czechoslovakia after 1926. Mists, dark shapes, vapor-coated windows and tangles of brush dominate his imagery. Sudek's beloved country seems to have been a dark and muddy place, and the music that inspired him must have been rather melancholy. Between the wars, his commercial work included product advertising and magazine assignments and ranged from modernist constructions of Czechoslovak ceramics to majestic photographs of Prague's ancient cathedral. His later work, better known here, often turned inward, resulting in images like the still life of an egg, its stark beauty glowing against a muted ground of a glass pane. At the same time, however, he took up the panorama camera, producing expansive horizontal landscapes and views of Prague streets. Zdenek Kirschner, the chief curator of prints and photography at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, knew Sudek for 25 years before his death. His text provides an informative overview of the photographer's life as well as comments on specific photographs.

It's an understandable grievance, especially since the group's early singles and EP's were characterized by pop melodies buried beneath rumbling tape machines and distorted guitars. Its 1992 debut album, \"Slanted and Enchanted,\" was rooted in the new wave of early 80's British bands like the Fall and Echo and the Bunnymen.   On its second full-length album, \"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain,\" the noise that endeared Pavement to fans of difficult rock has been stripped away, revealing coherent song structures and comparatively gentle arrangements.

This ever-astonishing score demands arduous athletic feats from soloistic instrumental groups, beginning with unison fortissimo winds in the very first bar. It often functions like a relay race: sections pick up onrushing rhythmic figures in split-second shifts, then sprint in the open air. Yet the musical surface must unfold with an unmechanical, spontaneous motion.   The conductor who succeeds in holding this difficult fabric together has little use for conventional podium bravura. There are many tempting opportunities for broad, clarifying gestures, but Nielsen's all-important forward momentum must be maintained in strict, businesslike fashion. Thus it is that certain star conductors on the order of Karajan and Bernstein have floundered with this music; the definitive accounts remain those recorded several decades ago by lesser-known Danish conductors who understood Nielsen's idiom intimately.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940314","headline":"Kohl Party Suffers Setback In North German State Vote","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/14/world/kohl-party-suffers-setback-in-north-german-state-vote.html","abstract":"  Voters in Germany's fourth-largest state handed Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party a sharp setback today in the first of 18 electoral contests around the country that will end with a national election Oct. 16.

Mr. Sitkovetsky's ally here was the music of Respighi: the third Suite from his \"Ancient Airs and Dances\" and an exceedingly curious arrangement of Bach's E-minor Sonata for violin and continuo. In them, Respighi does not recreate the past; he dreams about it. Old practices and instruments (as far as he knew them in 1932) are glimpsed through the haze of several centuries. Indeed, the \"Airs and Dances\" represent the Baroque as a 20th-century Romantic wished it had been.

His story is told tonight, sketchily but entertainingly, on A&E in a segment of \"Biography\" called \"Milton Berle: Mr. Television.\"   As a master of ceremonies in vaudeville in the 1930's (heralded as the youngest M.C. ever to work B.

The veterans Joe Kocur and Mike Gartner elected to play 36 holes of golf on Sunday, and had the sunburned faces to show for it. \"We underestimated the sun,\" said Kocur, reaching for some skin lotion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940315","headline":"Crackdown by Israel Is Off to a Slow Start, But More Is Promised","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/15/world/crackdown-by-israel-is-off-to-a-slow-start-but-more-is-promised.html","abstract":"  A day after it outlawed two virulently anti-Arab groups, Israel pursued its tougher policy toward militant Jewish settlers today, with the police searching houses in Hebron for weapons and detaining the firebrand leader there, Rabbi Moshe Levinger.   The results of the dragnet were slender: two guns, a couple of arrests and the quick release of Rabbi Levinger after questioning about his reportedly disruptive behavior a few months ago at the Cave of the Patriarchs, the Hebron shrine where a Brooklyn-born settler killed at least 29 Muslim worshipers on Feb. 25, abruptly halting Israeli-Arab peace talks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940315","headline":"Boom and Bust May Be the Norm in Nature, Study Suggests","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/15/science/boom-and-bust-may-be-the-norm-in-nature-study-suggests.html","abstract":"  FROM sudden plagues of locusts to mysterious declines in sought-after creatures like the Dungeness crab, the booms and busts of nature have puzzled researchers. A new study suggests that scientists may sometimes have difficulty finding an environmental cause for these fluctuations simply because there is not one.    In the study published last month in the journal Science, researchers at the University of California at Davis found evidence that many animals, even when they are unperturbed by unusual weather or any other alterations in their environment, can undergo wildly unpredictable changes in their numbers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940315","headline":"The Nation of Europe : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/15/opinion/IHT-the-nation-of-europe-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Nations Can Resolve to Act, but Europe Isn't a Nation\" (Opinion, Feb. 10) by William Pfaff:.As much as Switzerland is a nation, Europe can and will be one; in fact, it is already happening.

That it should come over the loudspeaker system puzzled no one. As always, the pilgrims were told, Amparo Cuevas, a 64-year-old former cleaning woman, had gone into ecstasy earlier in the day and spoken in the voice of Mary.

Uproarious Frenchness, indeed, took up most of the Orchestre Nationale de France's program under Charles Dutoit on Sunday afternoon. \"Le Corsaire,\" Berlioz's early overture, was splendidly done: playing of great elegance that was virtually lifted in the air by a corporate energy and grace. French orchestras, with some justification, have not enjoyed the best of reputations in recent years.
