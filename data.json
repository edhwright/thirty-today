As D'Arcy Westrey's bass tolled octaves, Billy Corgan sang \"I gave my life away/And I feel no pain,\" followed by sustained wordless notes. The video screen behind the band showed a ballroom full of waltzing couples; a rippling guitar motif seemed to suspend time, holding the audience rapt. The effect was inseparable from the magnitude of the sound and image. It was rock for a big audience in a huge space.   Alternative rock and its forebear, punk, were once hostile to arena-rock, which was seen as an impersonal, commodified version of the real thing. But that was before Nirvana and before Lollapalooza itself, which made alternative-rockers realize that their audience was far larger than they expected. Lollapalooza, packaged as a daylong excursion into the underground, has been a consistent concert draw every summer since 1991.

Washington is already hard at work replacing the 10,000 slots lost in Panama with commitments from other countries, some as far afield as West Africa. This frantic search helps meet a desperate humanitarian need, but there can be no mistaking that a policy that diverts black Haitians while welcoming mostly white refugees from other troubled nations reeks of racial discrimination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940709","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/09/nyregion/c-corrections-621340.html","abstract":"  An obituary yesterday about Ralph C.

And there are many downright exhilarating rescues performed in this volume, produced with the Nippon Television Network, which underwrote the project to clean Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel and documented it on film. The color photographs in the book, by Takashi Okamura, are captivating, especially a double foldout spread depicting the entire ceiling. In fact, the title of the book is slightly misleading, since the book covers only the ceiling, having been prepared before work on \"The Last Judgment\" was completed this year. The book contains essays by 10 leading experts on Michelangelo and the restoration. They are not written for casual readers, but several will make the great frescoes, and all of Michelangelo's art, vastly richer for anyone with the determination to understand them -- especially Michael Hirst's treatise on the surviving drawings of bodies the artist made from life for the huge figures on the ceiling; Gianluigi Colalucci's beguiling and illuminating essay on how the frescoes were made; and Mr. Shearman's warm and opinionated chapter on the purposes of the colors. \"The Sistine Chapel\" is a book that can be read, in part or wholly, many times with increasing wonder. Now that the ceiling appears much as it did to its creator, I want to leap up into it, looking and feeling and sniffing, to roll around in it. I am glad to have the assurance of the angular Mr. Shearman that Michelangelo invited such robust reactions. What is obvious now, he says, is that this heaven of color was meant to give pleasure, \"like that of a bouquet,\" and he adds that as the artist worked \"the poet in him was released.\" That is one reality rescued from the grime.

A top female marathon swimmer at the time, Friedman had once held the women's record for swimming around Manhattan. On the day that Friedman was to leave for England, however, her husband, Paul Carter, who was to accompany her, was hit by a truck while crossing a Manhattan street on his way to work. Carter died the following day. What follows are excerpts from Friedman's notes about the lure of long-distance swimming and the special bond that exists between people who share that commitment.\nThe Elements\nAgony of the Cold: Schroon Lake, N.Y. \n\n When we arrived for a training swim that morning in early June 1990, Schroon Lake was as still as death, shrouded in the slightest promise of fog. The water had the opacity of disaster, of depths not meant to be tested. I took off my shoes, hitched my sweat pants above my ankles and walked reluctantly down the boat launch, gasping as the water pierced my feet. It was as if it was solid and sharp, like the ice it had been but a few short weeks before. I stared into the mist, glanced down the ramp toward the deeper water, turned around and walked away from it. \n\n\"Forget about it,\" I told Paul. \"Put the canoe back in the truck. I can't even get in that stuff above my ankles.\"\n\nThe water thermometer read 58 degrees, 40 degrees below my body temperature, 26 degrees above freezing.\n\nPaul ignored me. I knew he was thinking that if I couldn't do this, I couldn't do the Channel, and for as long as I could remember, I had wanted to swim the English Channel. He continued to load Thermoses and towels into the canoe, using that reproachful silence to coax me into trying again.\n\nI slowly, lingeringly, made my way back down the boat launch. Somehow, this time, it didn't hurt as much. It was a lesson that I learned again and again: One can get used to the cold gradually, slowly enough to deaden the pain. I found my cap and goggles and put them on, knowing that it would be a lifetime before I felt warm again. \n\nPaul sat floating in the canoe, tantalizingly out of reach. He encouraged me, cheering every inch until I was up to my neck with nowhere to go but towards him, and so I pushed off and started to swim. The shock was too great. An iron band instantaneously clamped itself around my forehead. I turned around, gasping for air as yet another band tightened itself around my chest. Ten strokes and I was back on dry land without making a dent in the nine miles ahead of me.\n\nClinging to the memory that water feels marginally warmer on the second try, I steeled myself for another attempt. I knew that the sooner I started and the faster I swam, the sooner it would be over.\n\nSo I slipped back into that liquid ice and started swimming for real. Paul was instantly at my side. I tried to convince myself that I was an island of heat, pulling my way through a chill that couldn't touch me. Numbness is generally defined as absence of feeling, but the process by which one achieves it is invariably painful. And once one arrives, it is clear that numbness is nothing more than agony in a different form. \n\nWe had agreed that Paul would stop me every hour for food -- for this swim, mostly hot chocolate and chicken soup. When it seemed that an hour would never pass, I asked Paul to stop me every half hour. Even so, it was an eternity until that half hour mark. When I finally stopped, my hands shook uncontrollably as I gulped the hot liquid, feeling the warmth travel through my body as if tracing an anatomical road map.\nThe Motivation\nMission or Whim? Paradox Lake, N.Y. \n\n While swimming usually brings out all that is graceful in me, that day I fought to free my arms from the water lest they be frozen in place. Each stroke shattered the brittle surface, every breath became a gasp. I just thought, \"O.K., I'll make it to the next half hour and then I'll get out.\" But then the hot chocolate would fool me with the illusion of warmth and I'd think, \"O.K., maybe I'll just go a little further,\" but then I couldn't stop until the next half hour was up, and the vicious cycle repeated itself until 4 hours and 18 minutes later, I walked out of the water, up the town beach, and into the warmth of Paul's arms.\n\nI would imagine that there are a fair number of people who wonder, \"Why would any sane person put herself through such an ordeal?\" Maybe the crux of the matter is sanity, but I prefer to think not. There is a certain pleasure in thinking, \"I have accomplished this. I have swum around Manhattan. I have done something beyond the realm of normal life, out of the ordinary, unexpected.\" It becomes a secret source of confidence, a private wellspring of originality. \n\nMostly, I think I just wanted to swim the Channel because it appealed to me, and all the explanations put forth, all the talk about goals and ideals, are just rationalizations for what was, in effect, a whim. There are those who will never understand why anyone would want to climb Mount Everest or traverse the North Pole if not for fame and fortune, and then there are the rest of us for whom such endeavors seem admirable and courageous only if done for more singular reasons.\n\nI read a story once. It was about a man who went to an artist to commission a painting of a fish. Days went by, then months, then years. Finally the man went back to the artist's studio, demanding the painting. The artist took out his brush, dipped it in paint and in minutes had painted a beautiful fish. The man exclaimed, \"If it was that easy, why did I have to wait all these years?\" The artist walked to a door, opened it and out tumbled hundreds of paintings of fish. \n\nThat is the essence of training, of rehearsing, of learning -- doing something so many times that in the final instance it seems easy, effortless. Sprinters swim thousands of meters daily in order to swim their fastest 50 meters. I swam hundreds of miles so that a particular 20-mile stretch would be attainable. One must enjoy the process as much as the result, the sense that one is at least heading in the direction of that perfect fish.\n\nSomehow one forgets the cold, forgets the fear and finds the exhilaration. Waves have that effect on me, the way I would imagine wind affects sailors or powder affects skiers.\n\nBut while waves are one thing, cold water is quite another. That summer I became increasingly frustrated by the fact that the cold still hurt so much. I was tired of numb fingers and toes, tired of shivering until my teeth chattered. But Paul came up with the solution: maybe I would never get used to it, he said, it would never feel comfortable to me, but at least I could do whatever it took to stay in. It was all a mind game. How much pain could I stand? How long could I bear the cold? As long as I thought I could. \nThe Support Crew\nA Special Bond: Lake George, N.Y. \n\n The English Channel swim was born out of happiness, out of intoxication with life. That spring I had the best job I ever had -- painting scenery for the movie, \"Green Card.\" Most movies are more drudgery and nonsense than the public could ever imagine. This one was more art and pleasure than I could ever have imagined. The movie studio was near the pool and I found myself swimming more and more, carried along on the richness of my life, killing time so Paul and I could ride the A train home together. Friends started asking if I was training for something and I started thinking, \"Why not?\" \n\nAt 34, I didn't think I could much longer spare the time and concentration needed for an endeavor such as the Channel. Before I met Paul, the English Channel seemed inconceivable. It was too distant, too costly, too much of a burden to be borne alone. I thought I would do this thing, swim the Channel, and then start acting like a grown-up.\n\nWe had decided that a 10-hour swim should be part of the training and chose July 6 on Lake George since it had the coldest water left in the Adirondacks. There would be little sense of progress in terms of distance, only in terms of time. Each hour would be the limit of my focus. Short-term goals make feats of endurance possible, be they landmarks or minutes. While swimming around Manhattan, I told myself, \"Just make it to the Hudson River. O.K., now just get to the George Washington Bridge, O.K., now Riverside Church, now the Empire State Building.\" \n\nTo approach a swim as one massive endeavor would be overwhelming so one breaks it down into what one imagines to be manageable components. It's the only way I know to get through the rough spots: O.K., just another hour, just another day.\n\nThe bond between a marathon swimmer and a support crew is tight. I swim freestyle, or crawl, stroking about 72 times a minute. I alternate breathe -- that is, I breathe on my left, take three strokes, then breathe on my right, take three strokes, etc. Therefore, I am looking at my boat every six strokes, or a dozen times a minute. All the quick glances add up to a long stare, the way flickering images make an old movie or barely noticed gestures become memory.\n\nThere is nothing more discouraging than watching a friend bundled up, huddling in a futile attempt to stay dry, knowing that I alone am responsible for his discomfort and boredom. It reached the point where my closest friends declined offers of all-expenses-paid weekends in the Adirondacks. \n\nTraining with Paul allowed me to rid myself of the guilt for the most part. We were too intertwined to allocate responsibility or blame; to even remember whose idea the whole thing was. Training together added romance to the tedium, another layer to the pattern of our life. In earlier years, I had hated the intrusion of a boat; the summer of the English Channel I hated swimming alone.\n\nJuly was spent in a tightly scheduled training regimen. I left our apartment every morning at 6 A.M. for a workout in the 50-meter outdoor pool at Roberto Clemente State Park in the Bronx.\n\nAfter each workout, I drove out to Jones Beach where I forced myself back into the water. Every so often in a lake, I was possessed of an almost overwhelming fear that some Loch Ness-like monster would rise from the depths. I calmed myself by thinking that such a creature would surely recognize me as a kindred spirit and let me be. This worked well enough in a lake, but the ocean was a whole different kettle of fish. The sea was home to creatures far bigger than I, and even the smaller varieties were capable of inflicting great pain.\n\nAnd then there was the water, overwhelming in its strength, oblivious to any obstacles in its path. There is a friend of mine, a good swimmer and a strong young man, who was tossed into the sand by a careless wave and will never walk again, or use his arms. Wanting my relationship with the sea to remain superficial, I was determined, with all due respect, to remain on the surface.\n\nOnce I settled into the salt water, I got used to its sting, to the momentary panic I felt when I was confronted by that surging power. The corklike buoyancy one has in salt water added to my impression of insubstantiality, allowing me to escape gravity and experience the grace of weightlessness.\n\nAfter a planned two-hour swim, or however long it turned out to be, I ate lunch, rested a bit then swam for at least another hour. Then I showered away the salt, changed clothes, drove home and waited for the sound of Paul's key in the lock, the lovely, substantial click that signaled the end of a day spent in the isolation of amorphous splashing.\n\nAnd so the summer drifted by, one day floating into the next, sweeping us along on undercurrents of hope, on the promise of dreams realized. It seemed so simple and childlike -- the belief that one could do anything if one just set one's mind to it.\n\nAs an adult I had come to realize that there were complications, that giving one's all wasn't always enough, but that summer I regressed into all those youthful assumptions. Being no longer youthful, I feared that it was too good to be true, too good to last. Or maybe that's just how I remember it, filtered as it is through watered down memories.\nThe Rehearsal Swim\nMoonless Miles: Crossing the Sound \n\n On July 26, I planned to become the first person to swim from Montauk, at the tip of Long Island, to Watch Hill, R.I. It was a perfect training swim for the Channel. The currents, temperature and distance were comparable for the two bodies of water.\n\nIt was a rough ride to the lighthouse beach, leaving Paul seasick from the moment we emerged from the still of Montauk harbor. We were behind schedule from the start. A bureaucracy-crazed park employee prevented my starting from the beach, so I was forced to leave from the boat. Paul greased me up while I hung on for dear life, still managing to smear him with lanolin every time I slammed into him. \n\nThe first half hour was enough to make me seriously question my choice of hobbies, if not my sanity. I was struggling to keep my long-digested breakfast down. Swarms of jellyfish engulfed me in a translucent cloud of gelatinous bubbles. My new prescription goggles allowed me to see them clearly. One of them brushed against me, then another, then another. Bracing myself for the pain, I awaited the inevitable sting, but it never materialized. They were harmless. \n\nWithin a short time, my nausea died down. I eased myself into a rhythm: arm over arm; mind over matter. Ella Fitzgerald's voice floated around in my mind: \"I'm wild again, beguiled again, a simpering, whimpering child again, bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I.\" I splashed through waves, rode over the top of them, slid to the bottom, all the while singing and daydreaming. Repetitive motion frees the mind to wander but the discipline imposed by the act of swimming keeps one in check. My mind may have been on the way to France but my stroke count never varied more than two strokes per minute throughout the entire journey.\n\nThe first hour is always the longest. It's as if I have to learn time anew. Once that hour has passed, I understand how long it is, that it is not the eternity it seemed. The difficulty in a swim is not cumulative, does not increase with the amount swum. It ebbs and flows. The chop picks up and settles down. The water is cold, then warm, then something in between. The pain increases somewhere, moves on, then subsides.\n\nThe currents weren't doing anything they were supposed to; one hour I swam four miles, another only a half mile. I had smeared grease on my prescription goggles, so I switched back to the normal ones and my world was reduced once more to water, sky and the blur of a boat. Paul kept assuring me he could see land just ahead, but like some half-glimpsed truth it remained out of sight for me. However, the excitement in his voice sent me flying over the water. Unfortunately, the tide was against me and what felt like a sprint was more akin to a dead end.\n\nWe were all entranced by the elegance of the sunset, until the darkness that followed delivered a new set of problems. It was next to impossible for the crew to keep me in sight. We had bought the clip-on phosphorescent sticks for the Channel swim, but I hadn't thought to bring them along. It wasn't planned that I would swim into the absolute darkness of a starless, moonless night. \n\nWe stopped for a conference just outside the harbor at Watch Hill. The crew told me it was too risky to take the boat beyond the last danger buoy as there were rocks lurking in the bay. I had the option of swimming to shore alone, at which time those rocks were still a problem, but only for me. Walking out of the water is the most satisfying part of a swim but this time it was not to be. I let Paul make the decision and he read my mind. The swim would officially end when I touched the final danger buoy, some 200 yards from shore, 3 minutes short of landfall, 19.5 miles from Montauk. I did a final sprint towards the swaying iron mass ahead of me, touched it, and swam back to the cheering boat. Paul pulled me clumsily onto the rear platform. That hug was surely worth the 8 hours and 56 minutes the swim had taken, more solid than standing on dry land.\nThe Channel\nLetting Go of Pain: Dover, England \n\n We had decided that I had a better chance of sleeping on the plane if I went to work out as usual. So that last morning, the day I was to fly to England, Aug. 8, 1990, I drowsily tore myself out of bed, out of Paul's arms, at about 5:40 A.M. He walked me to the door and we stood there, prolonging our goodbyes. \"I'm going to need a lot of phone calls today, honey,\" I said, \"I love you so much.\" \n\n\"And I love you, li'l Sal.\"\n\nAnd that was it, without warning, the end of my life, of my love, of any dream that ever meant anything. I drove off to the pool, swam the workout, and came home to pack. I waited for Paul to phone, but by then it was already too late. The police found me through the phone number on the prescription form for seasickness medication that was in his pocket. \n\nShortly after his death, several people suggested that I swim the English Channel some time in the future as a memorial to Paul. \n\nThey didn't understand about the cold. I knew that I could never go through the training again without him, but it started to seem that if I could do it the same summer, then Paul would really be along, in a way he never could be again. Somehow I figured no pain I inflicted on myself could be as severe as that I was experiencing, so I had nothing to lose. I told no one of my plans.\n\nSometime in late August I phoned the boat pilot in England. He was hesitant but agreed to see what he could do if I showed up. The train ride to Dover was simple. The day I arrived I swam. \"This is barely cold,\" I thought initially, amazed. \"This would have been absolutely possible.\" \n\nI swam for 40 minutes but couldn't stop shivering afterwards. The next day I could only stay in for 20 minutes. The beach was too empty. My attention span was too short. It was only possible to swim for as long as the cold distracted me, then I had to move on to something else; reading a book, walking a few miles, taking a train to Canterbury. Letting go of the Channel turned out to be the easiest thing I did that summer. It was without meaning in the context of what had been, and what would never be.\nThe Aftermath\nSwimming Alone: Paradox Lake, N.Y. \n\n I've taken to spending my summers in the Adirondacks. The first year I didn't swim so much -- lifting rocks to build a stone wall around Paul's grave was exhausting enough. The second year I swam more, and last year I was almost disciplined about it. I swim in the early morning from the dock where once we planned our future. I've rigged a beach ball to a Velcro strap around my ankle, so that no one can complain I'm difficult to spot, and I swim down the center of the lake. I won't give anyone another chance to yell at me for swimming alone. Those rules don't apply to me.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940710","headline":"City Animals: Just Trying to Cope; Summer Heat Brings an Increase in Urban Pet Afflictions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/10/nyregion/city-animals-just-trying-cope-summer-heat-brings-increase-urban-pet-afflictions.html","abstract":"  The annals of urban veterinary medicine and the wards of animal hospitals in New York City on hot summer nights offer a weird glimpse of the perils and pressures of big-city life in the late 20th century.

Ms. Rebeck is not only alarmed, she also speaks with the authority of the observant outsider who has been on the inside. Like Belinda, her alter ego in the play, Ms. Rebeck has a Ph.D. in Victorian literature and has worked as a television writer in Los Angeles. She's also unusual among today's comedy writers (in the theater as well as television) in that she can come up with very funny lines that erupt naturally from the situations. Her characters aren't written to be played over the heads of the other actors to the house.

Stanley R. Arthur -- who until recently was indeed the nominee for the job.    And in seeking an example of how far Pentagon leadership has fallen, and how the issue of sexual harassment has descended into ugly McCarthyism, one could hardly find a more telling case than Admiral Arthur's sudden dispatch to early retirement.    Admiral Arthur is a hero of two wars -- a pilot who earned an extraordinary 11 Distinguished Flying Crosses while flying more than 500 combat missions in Vietnam, then commanded the allied naval armada in the Persian Gulf. His Pentagon experience is exemplary, too, including high-level budget planning, nearly three years as chief of the Navy's worldwide logistics system and two years as Vice Chief of Naval Operations.    After Admiral Arthur was nominated for the Pacific command, Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota indicated that he would raise questions about the treatment of a constituent, a female officer who claimed the Navy treated her unfairly when she failed flight training after accusing an instructor of sexual harassment. Admiral Arthur's only role in the case was that of final reviewing officer. He approved earlier findings that although the woman, Lieut. (j.g.) Rebecca Hansen, had been harassed (the Navy had already disciplined an instructor), she failed to quality as a pilot because of a poor flight record, both before and after the incident.    The inspectors general of the Navy and the Defense Department agreed with this finding. Navy Secretary John H. Dalton approved a recommendation that the Navy prepare to discharge her. Key senators told the Pentagon that Admiral Arthur would be approved for his new command but that because of Mr. Durenberger's \"hold\" his confirmation might be delayed until fall.    Then on June 24, the Navy said in a terse statement that Admiral Arthur \"agrees with Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Boorda\" that his nomination should be withdrawn because an \"anticipated delay in Senate confirmation\" would not permit \"a prompt relief\" for Adm. Charles R. Larson, the current commander in the Pacific, who is scheduled to become Superintendent of the Naval Academy. Admiral Arthur is to be retired as soon as his job is filled.   The Navy's explanation was disingenuous at best. Admiral Larson's new assignment is not time-sensitive; in fact, it also awaits Senate action. It has been widely reported that Admiral Boorda is less concerned about a delay in Admiral Arthur's confirmation than about becoming ensnared in another sexual harassment scandal. Even Senator Durenberger's key staff assistant said he was \"flabbergasted\" by the decision to end Admiral Arthur's 37-year career in such a manner.   More important, this episode raises serious questions about Admiral Boorda's fitness to be Chief of Naval Operations and demonstrates the Clinton Administration's lack of regard for military leaders.    Admiral Boorda has gained a reputation for political expediency. In 1992, when he was Chief of Personnel, he summarily relieved one of the Navy's brightest young admirals, Jack Snyder, after the initial revelations about the Tailhook scandal. Admiral Snyder, who had gone well beyond what was required in his efforts to assist the key female witness and urge an investigation, was not even allowed to defend his actions. This abandonment of a deserving officer in the face of political attack did not hurt Admiral Boorda's chances for advancement -- which may well have encouraged his shoddy treatment of Admiral Arthur.    After quashing Admiral Arthur's career, Admiral Boorda disregarded Secretary Dalton's recommendation to discharge Lieutenant Hansen and went to Great Lakes, Ill., to meet with her. She presented him with 10 demands, including that the Navy rewrite her fitness reports using words of her choosing, that they send her to law school at the Navy's expense and then assign her to work as a lawyer handling women's issues, and that the Secretary officially apologize to her. According to The New York Times, Admiral Boorda responded by offering her a job on his personal staff. (She did not accept it.)    Under any standard of leadership, Admiral Boorda's conduct is seriously deficient on several grounds: disloyalty to deserving subordinates, faulty judgment and usurping the authority of the Secretary of the Navy.    Which leads us to the Clinton Administration's handling of this event. Once his nomination went forward, Admiral Arthur was the President's candidate, and it was not within Admiral Boorda's jurisdiction to withdraw. In fact, since the Pacific command is \"purple\" -- that is, commanding military units from all the services -- Admiral Arthur was technically never Admiral Boorda's candidate from the beginning. And yet after the withdrawal we heard no word from either the Secretary of the Navy or the President, and Defense Secretary William J. Perry merely said he had decided not to intervene.    On July 1 the Administration announced that Vice Adm. Richard Macke, a capable but far less experienced officer who had been slated to replace Admiral Arthur as Vice Chief of Naval Operations, would be nominated instead to the Pacific command. Thus a three-star officer is to be placed in the Navy's most senior and prestigious four-star billet, partly because his paperwork was already in the White House.    The casual way in which the Administration has dealt with command replacement for a theater where war could be imminent indicates either naivete or arrogance when it comes to the importance of strong military leadership. And it is a grim omen for the future of the U.S. military when competent warriors are sent home by political admirals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940710","headline":"Most Russians Know Violence and Starvation; Two-Jacket Diplomacy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/10/opinion/l-most-russians-know-violence-and-starvation-two-jacket-diplomacy-630934.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Getting Real on Central Europe\" (Op-Ed, June 28) by Zbigniew Brzezinski brings to mind a Ralph Waldo Emerson observation: \"People see only what they are prepared to see.\"   Contrary to Mr. Brzezinski's perception, Russia's post-imperialist behavior isn't primarily defined by its relations with Ukraine.

This was Mr. Gussow's idea, as was the similar \"Mushroom Project\" of 1990, in which shadow images of threatened species, from whales to insects, were used to point up the connection between the annihilation at Hiroshima and the day-to-day elimination of species in peacetime.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940710","headline":"Corrupt Co-op Agents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/10/realestate/your-home-corrupt-co-op-agents.html","abstract":"  BOARDS of co-ops and condominiums in New York City are coming under pressure to explore ways to gain compensation -- or reimbursement -- for the thousands of extra dollars they may have paid out because of corrupt managing agents.

He was a shy, modest man, without the biographical drama of a van Gogh or a Gauguin. He identified himself as an outsider, a misfit, and his art depicts lonely figures in empty spaces, and other figures with eyes shut, lost in thought.
