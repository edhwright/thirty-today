Rather, it was the challenge of tackling the first slice of the \"Divine Comedy,\" perhaps the greatest poem ever written. The \"Inferno\" had been rendered into English a hundred times by scholars and writers, and yet remained elusive, unmastered, poetry's Everest of the underworld.   Some, like Dorothy L. Sayers in the late 1940's, had gone for a strict line-by-line translation of the \"Divine Comedy,\" and ended up with a work that sounded stilted to the English ear, lacking the momentum of the Italian original. The poet Allen Mandelbaum, whose paperback version is widely used in university courses, worked 20 years to preserve the line-by-line sequence and diction of Dante, but did not attempt to match rhymes. Charles S. Singleton's 1970 edition -- considered perhaps the most scholarly, with separate volumes for notes -- eschewed the poetic form altogether for a painstakingly literal prose translation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950131","headline":"Bosnian Asks G.O.P.

Thousands of elk, deer and bison, driven from higher elevations by winter, congregate in the valley.

Now, in an ambitious restoration project, two packs and the nucleus of another -- 14 wolves in all, the first of a group that could eventually grow to hundreds -- have been living since the middle of the month in three one-acre pens within the valley and are soon to be set free. When they are released, the result is likely to be an ecological upheaval whose ripples will spread in time to the farthest, most obscure corners of a region the size of West Virginia.

As in opera and song, words are central. But in those forms the composer dictates pitch, rhythm, tempo, phrasing and coloration, effectively controlling the text's expressive power. In melodrama, the words and the reader's mastery of it are central. The music can be supportive, illuminating or in the way, but it is inescapably secondary.   The trick, of course, is to make the music seem so integral that a plain reading would seem naked without it. The Unterberg Poetry Center at the 92d Street Y posed this challenge to Lee Hoiby, Ned Rorem and Robin Holloway, three composers best known for their expertise at setting texts. Each was commissioned to write a work for speaker and piano -- specifically, for Claire Bloom and Brian Zeger -- and their very different solutions were given premieres on Monday evening in a program called \"Women in Mind.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950201","headline":"1990's Decadence Hits a New Low","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/style/1990s-decadence-hits-a-new-low.html","abstract":"ALICE MEDRICH introduced the world to golf-ball-size truffles and her definitive version of chocolate decadence cake, benchmarks for gastronomic sybarites of the 1980's, through her seven Cocolat stores in the San Francisco area.

While the popular hard-rock bands of the 1990's (like Pearl Jam and Nine Inch Nails) play music in which victims release their rage, Megadeth has stuck to its roots in the 80's and continued to make music in which oppressors show their might.   \"I make you wanna scream in pain, and feel your life is just a losing game,\" Mr. Mustaine, who was kicked out of Metallica in the early 80's, growled in \"Reckoning Day,\" from Megadeth's sixth and latest album, \"Youthanasia\" (Capitol).

It is not easy to argue the merits of Federal spending to diminish poverty, hunger and disease abroad when budget cuts mean inadequate funding for those problems at home. But some substantial benefits for the U.S. can be secured by relatively inexpensive foreign aid programs that are carefully selected and managed.    Aid that directly attacks the causes of global insecurity like poverty, disease, overpopulation and environmental degradation can prevent the sort of political instability and humanitarian disasters that ultimately require more costly American involvement. If the budget-cutters are not careful, they may shortchange aid to those who need it most and where it may do the most good.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950202","headline":"Kovalev Returns and He's a Culprit With Campbell","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/sports/hockey-kovalev-returns-and-he-s-a-culprit-with-campbell.html","abstract":"  There can be no debate about one simple statistic: Aleksei Kovalev of the Rangers was on the ice for all four Pittsburgh goals tonight when the undefeated Penguins edged New York by 4-3 at Civic Arena.

Mr. Armey constructs an adamant defense in a righteously indignant letter (Jan. 30). However, in explaining the detailed intricacies of a \"slip,\" he fails to condemn anti-gay sentiments without exception.   On the day the world commemorated the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, an atrocity painfully remembered as the consequence of hatred and intolerance, it is particularly ironic and offensive that Dick Armey would publicly use the slur \"fag.\"   Although these two events have been separated by 50 years, they are inextricably connected by their essential cores: politically and publicly espoused hatred and bigotry.   There is an insidious link between anti-gay slurs and violence against gay men and lesbians.    Since April 1993, there have been eight brutal murders of gay men in Dick Armey's home state of Texas, yet he fails to address the serious implications of hate toward gay people.   Gay men and lesbians face an increased threat to our lives and well-being for fear of hostility and violence everywhere we turn -- from the streets of our neighborhoods to our jobs.   Mr. Armey owes an unqualified apology not only to Mr. Frank but also to all gay men and lesbians, who must now endure the consequence of his deliberate refusal to declare publicly that bigotry and hatred is a path the world cannot afford to take again.

Back at the end of the 1970's, Mr. Lowe emerged as a producer (for Elvis Costello and others) and songwriter who toyed with pop genres and tucked unexpected words into cheerful, catchy tunes.

Leading his new band for a packed house at Wetlands Preserve on Monday night, Mr. Lowe played a set that explored heartbreak and loneliness before winding up, in encores, with a glimpse of new love.    He hasn't grown sappy or lost his sense of humor. From country and soul songwriters, Mr. Lowe has learned restraint; his lyrics don't gush, and he doesn't over-indulge his old taste for wordplay. Instead, he aims for a telling simplicity; the hymnlike \"Lover Don't Go\" begins, \"There's a hollow in the bed where your body used to be/Like the hollow in your heart where the love once was for me.\" He sings without pushing too hard, and while his understatement is partly a result of a limited range, he can lend his voice a country quaver or a hint of a yodel.

The agreement between the city and advocates for the homeless, signed by Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court, requires the city to begin immediately to fashion a system for housing the homeless that does not rely on families' sleeping on chairs and tables in offices or staying in substandard welfare hotels. In exchange, the advocates who had sued the city on behalf of homeless families agreed to suspend the litigation, freeing the city from court-imposed fines for at least six months.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950202","headline":"A Deficit Reins In Sweden's Welfare State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/world/a-deficit-reins-in-sweden-s-welfare-state.html","abstract":"  In the last six decades, Sweden has built one of the world's most generous and successful social welfare systems, providing its citizens with a lifelong array of benefits that help them maintain a high standard of living through good times and bad.

George Pataki has crafted a budget that follows his campaign promises, but also threatens to deal punishing blows to New York City. Indeed, the Governor's cuts in state aid to the city's schools, subways and hospital and welfare programs are so sweeping that political opponents in Albany seemed stunned. Mr. Pataki needed to limit spending, of course, to close the deficit and at the same time make good on his promised tax cuts. Given the reality that he has the political strength to redistribute revenues in this way, questions of fairness -- in sharing the pain of budget reductions and the rewards of the tax breaks -- become foremost.   Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, said the $5 billion in spending reductions was \"significantly, purposefully targeted at New York City.\" He foresaw a $100 million loss to schools, a 25- or 30-cent subway fare increase and several hundred million in losses for the Health and Hospitals Corporation. In other words, he portrays the Governor as contemplating an unfairly brutal blow to the social-services infrastructure of a city with over half of New York State's welfare population.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950202","headline":"Knicks Will Live or Die on 3-Pointer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-will-live-or-die-on-3-pointer.html","abstract":"  Watching Derek Harper shadow box after practice today showed the kind of fight the Knicks have demonstrated in winning 16 of their last 18 games.
