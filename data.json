A woman who never put fashion high on her list of priorities is being criticized left and right for what she has been wearing for the inaugural festivities this week.    The main target: the hat. A blue velour number with a turned-back brim that some say made her look like a chipmunk. People kept wondering why she didn't at least take it off when she removed her matching coat. Maybe there was no time to get her hair into shape since it seemed to be just pulled back into a tail under the hat. Or maybe she liked it. The designer did.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930122","headline":"Review/Theater; Revised 'Last Yankee,' With Focus on Wives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/theater/review-theater-revised-last-yankee-with-focus-on-wives.html","abstract":"  In \"The Last Yankee\" a major playwright, Arthur Miller, is writing in a minor key. More anecdotal than dramatic, the play, at the Manhattan Theater Club, is enhanced by the contribution of the cast, under the direction of John Tillinger. Basically the work is an overlapping slice of life about two disparate wives in contrasting but equally disastrous marriages. They are driven to the same end: a severe state of depression. Each case is in the nature of a case history, with the playwright diagnosing the illness and offering a litany of causes without fully investigating the roots of the shared problem or the marriages themselves. In each story, the husband would seem to bear much of the responsibility for his wife's depression.    In an earlier, 20-minute version of the play at the Ensemble Studio Theater, the emphasis was on the husbands, a prosperous local businessman and a carpenter living below his social class. They met in the waiting room of a state mental hospital and gradually revealed their differences (and the similarity of their wives' ailments). The expanded version, which opened last night and will be presented in a different production in London next week, runs barely more than one hour. It abbreviates the waiting room scene and reduces the dramatic buildup of the male conflict. Then it shifts to the women, who are nervously postponing the moment they will face their husbands.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/arts/art-in-review-889993.html","abstract":"  Andy Warhol   Gagosian Gallery  136 Wooster Street  SoHo  Through Jan. 30    Western culture tends to give special attention to an artist's last works, as if they couldn't help but yield crucial secrets or crown a career.

After working as a duo for more than 45 years, the singer Jackie Cain and the singer and pianist Roy Kral took the last year off to live a very different kind of life. The husband-and-wife team drove around the country without having to be on a schedule, and for the first time they could fully enjoy the house in Montclair, N.J., that they have owned for many years. But now they are back following their old way of life. Tonight through Sunday, they are winding up a week at Tavern on the Green with a show that includes some of their favorite songs by composers like Stephen Sondheim and Alec Wilder, and some new additions to their repertory by Dave Brubeck (\"In Your Own Sweet Way\" and \"The Duke\"). They are also dipping into Duke Ellington for the first time as they begin to explore his work in depth. They perform tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30 and on Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30. No minimum; $15 music charge tonight and tomorrow, $10 on Sunday.  Heavenly Dixieland    Kenny Davern Quartet, Church of the Heavenly Rest, Fifth Avenue at 90th Street, (212) 752-1428 or 556-3865. From the often-stereotyped world of Dixieland jazz, the clarinetist Kenny Davern has shaped a style filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep alive the dry and wry manner of Pee Wee Russell and provide a setting for his own refreshing explorations. His quartet, with Howard Alden on guitar, Frank Tate on bass and Tony De Nicola on drums, returns to the Heavenly Jazz series on Sunday afternoon, exactly one year after its last appearance there. Tickets for the concert, which starts at 5 P.M., will be on sale at the door for $10 ($7 for students and the elderly).  Guitar With Polish    Frank Vignola Trio, J's, 2581 Broadway, between 97th and 98th Streets, Manhattan, (212) 666-3600. Frank Vignola, a guitarist who initially traded on the fame of Django Reinhardt's precise and swinging single-string solos, is now working in a much broader area that encompasses material from swing to bop to Latin jazz. But the polish that brought distinctive charm to his Reinhardt period is still a feature of his playing, with John Goldsby on bass and Joe Ascione on drums. The trio plays on Sunday night from 8:30 to 12:30. No cover charge; minimum: $12 at tables, $7 at the bar.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/sports/transactions-579293.html","abstract":"  Baseball American League","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"Acting Chiefs Named At 2 U.S. Endowments","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/arts/acting-chiefs-named-at-2-us-endowments.html","abstract":"  The heads of the National Endowment for the Arts and of the National Endowment for the Humanities have stepped down and named their acting successors.

Kennedy, from his birth in 1917 to his assassination in 1963. I was graciously welcomed by Jacqueline Onassis (my father had been a friend of J.F.K. and of Robert F. Kennedy). Senator Edward Kennedy promised a series of interviews about his own family background, his grandfather John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, his parents and, above all, his elder brother.\n\nUnfortunately, Senator Kennedy canceled the interviews in 1989. Nevertheless, when we met at Harvard the following year, he effusively praised my efforts, saying that he hadheard from Arthur Schlesinger what \"fine\" preliminary lectures on J.F.K.'s early years I'd given at my university. Once again, the Senator promised help and cooperation and, to demonstrate his sincerity, called me over to meet his sister Eunice, who to my great delight promised to make available to me her unique letters from J.F.K., particularly those sent from Lithuania at the start of World War II, my special area of interest.\n\nSadly, the promises again proved empty. Instead, six months later, I was called by Milton Gwirtzman, a Washington-based lawyer acting on behalf of the Kennedys, who asked me to \"alter my attitude\" toward Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Kennedy, as reflected in the very lectures Arthur Schlesinger had extolled and which had meanwhile been published in the New England Journal of Public Policy. \n\nTaken aback by the lawyer's proposal, I countered that, despite my credentials as a scholarly biographer, I had not received one jot of help from the Kennedys -- after three years of promises. Yet here they were, demanding that I alter my \"attitude\" (the photocopy of the journal article that Mr. Gwirtzman handed to me was scored in the text and the margins with scarlet ink!). I asked him to take a humble but firm message back to Washington: I would be glad to revise the portrait of J.F.K.'s parents, sketched in the lectures, if new evidence warranted such revision.\n\nI pointed out that hundreds of early J.F.K. letters were missing, having been removed from the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston by members of the Kennedy family or withheld from public access on their behalf. If permitted to see these letters, I would, if the evidence prove conclusive, willingly amend my somewhat unsparing account of J.F.K.'s childhood -- in particular, the emotional neglect by his mother when he was small, the despotism of his manically ambitious father and the effect of such a dysfunctional marriage on J.F.K.'s character. \n\nIn due course, Mr. Gwirtzman was authorized to search the family's secret holdings in the library for evidence that would justify revision. Letters were indeed found, he informed me, but they did not contradict my interpretation. As a result, I was not even permitted to see, let alone quote, from them. Senator Kennedy declined to cooperate in any further way. Eunice Shriver, likewise.\n\nWorse was to follow. On one occasion, my private mail was opened and its contents discussed by the staff of the John F. Kennedy Library -- normally a Federal offense. Although the perpetrator was reprimanded by the director, the atmosphere at the library soured considerably. The chief archivist, who had been on sick leave, was asked to resign on the day of his return. He had been a tower of strength to me and other researchers at the library. He bravely refused, with the immortal words, \"You will have to shoot me first.\" But it was a very near thing.\n\nMeanwhile, in deference to the Kennedys I was disinvited from an international academic conference on \"J.F.K. and Europe,\" held in Florence in October 1992. Although, after protesting I was reinvited to give the opening paper, I was not, in the end, permitted to deliver it -- to spare, I was told, the \"family feelings\" of the human rights activist Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, who was attending as the \"Kennedy representative.\" (Ms. Cuomo marched out of the auditorium when, during a debate on J.F.K.'s views on European security, I did manage to speak, briefly.)\n\nWhether my 926-page historical biography -- which takes J.F.K.'s heroic early life up to the age of 29 -- merits the vituperative labels bestowed by the Kennedys in a Dec. 3 article on this page, I am still too partial to judge. Nevertheless, I emphatically reject the accusation that it is \"reckless biography.\" No author could have done more to solicit the help and involvement of the Kennedys at every stage of research. Their lack of cooperation not only led me to believe that they not only dislike history but are also determined to defy its demands to the final bell, as they have for 30 years.\n\nFor instance, although Mrs. Onassis formally deeded the President's personal and official papers to the John F. Kennedy Library and the people of the U.S., many documents either never reached the library, or have been withdrawn, or have been tampered with, or have been concealed from researchers -- even from the library's own staff. Many collections, such as the Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Papers, are still under lock and key. Thousands of documents belonging to \"open\" collections have been removed or sanitized over the years to avoid the wrath of the Kennedys. \n\nCountless crucial documents -- such as J.F.K.'s medical files -- lie moldering in the vaults amid debate over whether to risk family retribution and open them. And this in a Federal archive! Most significant, in the library's great collection of interviews with colleagues, friends and subordinates of President Kennedy (numbering more than 1,500), there is not one single available serious interview with a member of the family about J.F.K., the man and brother.\n\nThis contempt for history is distressing. Truth, after all, is therapeutic, and though some details of J.F.K.'s rather louche private life are embarrassing to older family members and their lackeys, they are not shocking to my students, who were not even alive in 1963 and cling to no Camelot sentiment. Rather, as they explore with me the enormous difficulties J.F.K. faced in his life -- not the least difficulty being his ill health -- they gain in sympathy and understanding of the man. \n\nIs it too late for the Kennedys to alter their own attitude, as they once demanded I should alter mine? I do not think so. As the dust settles on the first edition of \"J.F.K.: Reckless Youth,\" perhaps Senator Kennedy and his sisters will rethink their response. I remain eminently willing to revise my text if the documents warrant. Moreover, to balance the many J.F.K. letters to which I did obtain access, and the intimate testimony given to me by J.F.K.'s closest surviving friends on the matter of his parents, I remain perfectly willing to talk with Senator Kennedy and his sisters and to quote their views. In \nmy opinion, they still have a vital historical contribution to make, if only they will bestir themselves. \n\nMy plea to the Kennedys, then, is to stop fiddling while the memory of J.F.K. burns. A recent memo from the Jean Monnet Council of George Washington University (which sponsored the Florence conference on J.F.K. and Europe) puts the matter succinctly: \"Kennedy's reputation today may be at something of a nadir.\" I urge the elder Kennedys, under a new President devoted to J.F.K.'s idealistic example, to help insure J.F.K.'s truthful place in history for a new generation of Americans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930122","headline":"When MICA's Commit Murder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/opinion/when-mica-s-commit-murder.html","abstract":"  The public's concern last summer focused on Larry Hogue, whose drug-related mental illness led to menace and violence on Manhattan's West Side.

Krzystof Penderecki's \"Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima\" and \"Polymorphia\" ushered in the 1960's as if the product of some unspoken commission. They and other pieces by the Polish composer became instantly famous. Where many composers had sought to reduce the uncertainties of a nuclear age to stringent counterpoint and rigorous organization, Mr. Penderecki embraced cold-war anxiety with a metaphor of his own.   The element of the mob was introduced, purposeful but not quite under control. Individual musicians and singers were pointed in a direction and then invited to play or sing what they wanted. Textures seethed with organic life. Color replaced harmonic change as a means of movement. Mr. Penderecki manufactured a reputation and a comfortable living from his early depictions of dread, even though those first pieces have long since lost their fascination for the sophisticated listener and even though he no longer writes music that resembles them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930123","headline":"Apartments for the Homeless Are Left Vacant in New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/23/nyregion/apartments-for-the-homeless-are-left-vacant-in-new-york.html","abstract":"  While scores of homeless families spend night after night on chairs and tables in the offices of the city's welfare agency, hundreds of apartments that have been set aside as permanent housing for the homeless have been standing empty, often for months at a time.

Quilting represented a coming together to create an object of warmth, but the art was also an avenue in which to apply the hands, head and heart to a craft.\n\nFor \"Textile Diaries: Quilts as Cultural Markers,\" an exhibition on view at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center through Feb. 21, antique and contemporary quilts were selected from the Kansas Quilt Project -- a statewide undertaking that registered more than 13,000 quilts between 1986 and 1988. The display perceives quilts as personal diaries that record the experiences of the quilter and the recipient.\nInspired by Kansas\n\n The project's goals, inspired in part by the 125th anniversary of Kansas statehood, were several: to heighten awareness of quilts as examples of Kansas folk art, to document the lives of the quilters and their work, to collect data on quilting and to establish a repository at the Kansas State Historical Society with the hope of promoting the art of quilting.\n\n\"Quilt Discovery Days,\" held on weekends throughout Kansas during a 16-month period, encouraged the public to bring in quilts and share their stories. Those that were very old and fresh from the quilting frame were solicited, as were those made in Kansas. The project's second phase sought groups and individuals who would not normally share their quilts at public functions, like museums and quilting clubs.\n\n\"For the women who made these quilts, and it was primarily a woman's craft, they were creating something useful, but it was also a way of expressing feelings, political happenings, grief, joy and hopes,\" said the museum's director of education and curator of the Stamford exhibition, Kai Underwood.\n\n\"Probably one of the most significant differences between quilters then and now is that they used to gather together to produce their craft work. It was an important social outlet and community activity.\nFor Walls not Beds\n\n \"Today while there is a revival of women grouping together, some individuals create quilts as an artist, like a painter. And the quilt is seen less as a bed coverlet than as an object of art to hang on walls.\"\n\nThe display captures the pride of quilters past plying traditional patterns in kaleidoscopic ways, and in bold contrast, the best of contemporary, painterly innovations.\n\nDivided into three themed sections -- \"Rites of Passage,\" \"Personal Memories\" and \"Marking Community Events\" -- 18 quilts are showcased, accompanied by texts and photographs telling the stories of the quilters. Most, though not all, are patchwork quilts. \"Making a quilt out of small patches, pieces of remnant cloth, is an American invention amply brought out in this exhibit,\" Mr. Underwood said \"People were land-rich and cash-poor. They saved worn-out clothing as well as other scraps so they could piece them together to create a larger coverlet.\"\n\nWomen made quilts for themselves and as gifts to mark significant events. They recorded rites of passage: birth, graduation, marriage and death. Patterns were not symbolic of the occasion but simply represented their favorite.\n\nQuilts for babies in the 1800's were most often full size, represented in the exhibition by a \"Mexican Rose\" pattern, appliqued with vibrant red and orange flowers by a mother expecting her sixth child in Sandusky, Ohio. The quilt was brought to Kansas by her son 60 years later.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, attitudes toward children changed. They were treated distinctly with juvenile theme patterns, illustrated in the show with a very feminine child-size, scalloped-edge animal applique quilt.\nAny Pattern Will Do\n\n There were no hard and fast rules to selecting patterns. \"Double Wedding Ring,\" a favorite used for graduation as well as marriage, is shown in blocks of brilliant pastels, constructed like an intricate patchwork jigsaw puzzle.\n\nA mourning quilt, \"Grandmother's Flower Garden,\" uses small patterned flowery colors plucked from the dresses of a daughter who died at the tender age of 8.\n\nIn \"Princess Feather,\" a mother playfully quilted corners with outlines of her own, daughter's and infant son's hands and feet. A friendship quilt, often a gift for those moving to the West, features blocks embroidered with the signatures of family friends, statements and the names of garments they came from.\n\nOne of the more contemporary quilts, \"Oh Beautiful,\" was chosen as the Kansas entry to a national contest during the centennial of the Statue of Liberty. Against an undulating landscape of fields, mountains and ocean, the statue's torch is flung high and a three-dimensional flag draped across the torso.\n\n\"You have to ask yourself whether the maker ever intended to see it on a bed or created it purely as an art form,\" Mr. Underwood said..\nMonday Quilting Bees\n\n A 30-minute video, \"Quilts in Women's Lives\" portrays seven contemporary quilters. And a quilting bee demonstration, conducted by the museum's quilting group, takes place every Monday from 9:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.\n\n\"The show reinforces the important role quilting played among women as an avenue of expression, not only of feelings but of skills,\" Mr. Underwood said. \"It was one of the few ways they could demonstrate their expertise in a creative way.\"\n\n\n\nStamford Museum and Nature Center, 39 Scofieldtown Road, is open Monday through Saturday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays, 1 to 5 P.M.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Croat-Serb Clash in Croatia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/world/croat-serb-clash-in-croatia.html","abstract":"  Croatian forces and breakaway Serbs were trading fierce artillery and small-arms fire near the Adriatic port of Zadar.

The term comes from \"hard-core techno,\" a brutal, high-speed style of electronic rave music. Early on, hard-core meant bombastic synthesizer -- programmed machine-rhythms and a clinical though crazed atmosphere. But the music evolved into a hybrid of hip-hop and techno, merging the former's grit with the latter's futuristic weirdness, as disk jockeys and producers started to take beats from rap records and speed them up. In the process, they retained hip-hop's funky syncopation, yet at tempos (140 to 150 beats per minute) far faster than any flesh-and-blood drummer could sustain.   Combining the revelry of disco and the disorientation of psychedelia, rave music tends to be brazenly druggy, in both its sound and its lyrical allusions. Hard-core is no exception. Its manic pace has been influenced by the fact that ecstasy, the raver's stimulant of choice, has become steadily more adulterated with amphetamine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"A Smorgasbord for the Ears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/arts/pop-music-a-smorgasbord-for-the-ears.html","abstract":"  When David McLees, a projects supervisor for Rhino Records, wanted to use the song \"Max's Kansas City\" on the label's nine-volume compilation of punk and new wave, he followed the money trail.

Certainly, Rodgers and Hammerstein didn't invent the code of values that their songs taught. With their stern, semioperatic melodies and know-it-all lyrics, they offered an idealized mirror image of American middle-class morality in the heady afterglow of Hitler's defeat.

As a result, the physics canon includes Wigner crystals, Wigner theorems, Wigner rules -- all expressions of symmetry and order. THE RECOLLECTIONS OF EUGENE P. WIGNER (Plenum, $24.50), as told to Andrew Szanton, makes it clear that the physicist's love of order has also spilled over into politics. When disorder of the most extreme sort came during World War II, Mr. Wigner's abhorrence of the Nazi plague contributed to a crucial application of physics to warfare: in 1939, he and Leo Szilard drove out to Albert Einstein's summer hideaway on Long Island and persuaded him to write the letter to President Roosevelt that initiated the Manhattan project, the development of a fission weapon. The project itself brought together a brilliant quartet of Hungarian physicists -- Eugene Wigner, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller and John von Neumann -- all of whom, save Szilard, embraced conservative politics after the war. Mr. Wigner became strongly anti-Communist and a supporter of the Vietnam War, largely, he says, because he saw a fearful symmetry between Nazism and Communism. Even Mr. Wigner's discussion of \n\nl'affaire \n\nOppenheimer -- how J. Robert Oppenheimer lost his security clearance after Mr. Teller testified against him -- is marked by a search for balance: he is evenhanded to his close friend Mr. Teller and to the downfallen leader of Los Alamos. Only when it comes to the political intrigues and turf wars in postwar weapons research does Mr. Wigner seem less than fair. On the whole, this memoir avoids the pitfalls of the as-told-to autobiography and serves as a useful addition to the history of science and science policy in the 20th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"DINING OUT;\nAging Gracefully in Granite Springs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/nyregion/dining-out-aging-gracefully-in-granite-springs.html","abstract":"FRITZ'S, in the county for at least two dozen years, first in a fondly remembered luncheonette in Somers and now in a cute, countryesque restaurant in Granite Springs, has moved gracefully into mellow middle age.

The most important criterion for judging a building's success as a symbol of corporate aspirations in that extravagant decade was not whether it functioned well, or whether it contributed anything to its surroundings, but whether it looked strikingly different and created an easily identifiable form.    The best proof around that such times are past -- and the best paradigm for urban corporate architecture in the 90's -- is the set of buildings finished late last year for Capital Cities/ABC along West 66th and West 67th Streets on the West Side of Manhattan. This is the utter opposite of architecture as logo. First, it isn't a single structure, standing apart like a prima donna; it is an array of five new buildings and a couple of renovated ones that contains the headquarters and a large chunk of the production facilities for this communications company and its television network. As a complex, the buildings make a statement about the workplace that is good, and a statement about urban architecture that is essential.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Hard Landing in Tokyo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/books/hard-landing-in-tokyo.html","abstract":"  THE BUBBLE ECONOMY   Japan's Extraordinary Speculative Boom of the 80's and the Dramatic Bust of the 90's.

In brief, Mr. Reagan portrays baymen as the absolute enemy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Again -- and at Last -- a New Camaro","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/sports/about-cars-again-and-at-last-a-new-camaro.html","abstract":"    \"In the 1960's, muscle cars were like the muscle men of the era: formidable, hulking presences dominated by brute strength. But the science of muscle has come a long way since then. Like today's bodybuilders, the 1993 Camaro is lean, finely proportioned and powerful. It's a muscle car for the Nineties.\"   -- Chevrolet overview of the 1993 Camaro.    I HAVE been prowling through my computer, looking for notes on a conversation that is now more than a decade old. Electrons are amazing, and I actually found what I was looking for.   It turns out that it has been 11 years since that sunny morning when the late Pete Estes and I stood talking in the outdoor dining area of Tavern on the Green in Central Park. Estes was then about to retire as president of General Motors, and he had come to New York to show off his final creation, Chevy's 1982 Camaro.   I remember discussing the crucial need for better fuel economy. The new Camaro was lighter than its predecessor but still heavy enough to have displeased the critics. Estes agreed, noting that the engineers had only scratched the surface.    \"So far, we've done the easy part,\" he said. \"We got rid of the fat. The rest is going to be tougher.\"   Aha! And now there is a new Camaro, the fourth generation, exactly 100 pounds heavier than the '82 model, but of the modern ilk, which is to say that it looks nothing like Camaros of the past. In the intervening years technology has taken the place of dieting and, heavier or not, the new car does go farther on a gallon of gas.   I remember expressing surprise, too, during that conversation with Estes, that G.M. had managed to get 10 years out of the same basic model. And his response was this: \"It shows what you can do when you do it right in the first place.\"   In fact, the Camaro and its twin, the Pontiac Firebird, have always been exactly right for their markets, sporty cars that could be dressed inexpensively or in go-fast fashion, appealing both to low-end buyers and to hot-rodders. And the Camaro is still right, still with an available V8 engine to burble pleasantly and to drive the rear wheels, still fast even in its conservative standard mode.   The new car competes against the Toyota Celica, Nissan 240SX, Ford Mustang, Eagle Talon, Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, among others. According to Chevrolet, 50 percent of the buyers in the sporty-car segment are women, and nearly half of Camaro's principal drivers are female, a figure that drops to 30 percent for the high-end Z28.   Both the Z28 and the standard car are hatchbacks, and the base coupe carries a 160-horsepower V6. The Z28, with a 5.7-liter V8 under its hood, is as always a flat-out performance car, and it will give a Corvette a run for its money.   That is not surprising, of course, since the 5.7-liter power plant is the same basic engine that lives under the Corvette's hood. In the Camaro, it produces 275 horsepower, and its bulk fills the engine compartment.   The new 3.4-liter V6 delivers 20 horsepower more than was available in 1992's standard car, and it sends it to the road through a five-speed manual transmission. The V8 produces 30 more horsepower than last year, and it is coupled to a new six-speed manual. Four-speed automatics are optional with either engine.   For '93, rack-and-pinion steering has replaced the recirculating-ball system of the past in order to improve responsiveness and an \"on-center\" feel. Antilock brakes also are standard.   The fourth generation car was redesigned head to tail, and Chevrolet's literature says that \"all classic Camaro design ingredients are evident.\" That is arguable, however, and the new model looks more like a Mitsubishi Eclipse than like anything else.   Part of that, at least in the case of the Z28, has to do with the paint scheme and the upper body. All Z28's have black roofs, and the darkly tinted glass makes the entire \"greenhouse\" look black. What has been retained from the past is the Camaro's tenacious stance, aggressive front end and brawny tires on 16-inch wheels.   The car is smooth but wedge-shaped. It rides on the same 101-inch wheelbase as the '92, but the body is longer, wider and taller. Sideview mirrors are fared into the front fenders, and a spoiler is integrated into the rear hatch. Trim is of the blackout variety, and the headlights nestle in black pockets.   The new Camaro makes extensive use of dent-resistant, rustproof body panels. The roof, doors, hatch and spoiler assembly are made of sheet-molded compound, and the front fenders, and nose and tail pieces also are made of composite material. Rust-resistant two-side galvanized steel is used for the rear quarter panels and hood.   The hatch itself has a very high liftover, leading to a deep well just inside and then to a shallow cargo floor. Luggage capacity is not this car's long suit.   Space also is at a premium in the rear of the redesigned interior, and even small children are likely to complain. On the other hand, the cockpit is comodious, and the new front buckets -- available only in cloth -- are both commodious and supportive.   The black and white Z28 test car had a two-tone gray interior, nicely finished although abundantly plastic. The instrument panel sort of wraps around the driver, and the analog gauges, dominated by a 150-mile per hour speedometer, are easy to read.   A huge door covers a medium-size glove compartment, in which resides the remote button for the rear hatch. The console contains a small ashtray, a single cupholder and a bin whose cover serves as an armrest. The shifter, as always, is topped by a large round knob, now covered with leather.   As tested and loaded with options, the car carried a sticker of $19,098, although the base price for a Z28 is a more reasonable $16,779. The least expensive Camaro goes for $13,399, and the cars will begin arriving in dealerships early in February.   Oddly enough, they are \"imports,\" coming from an assembly plant near Montreal. And they do now feel less like Detroit iron. The bone-jarring ride of the past is gone, as are many of the creaks and rattles that resulted from the huge metal doors. The new Z28 is tighter and a great deal more civilized than its ancestors.   On the road, though, there is still that slingshot acceleration. There is the taut suspension and good handling. And, of course, there is that wonderful rumble of a potent V8.   Like the '82 model that lasted almost unchanged for a decade, the newest Z28 has been named to pace the Indianapolis 500. And with the 77th running of the race on May 30, Chevrolet will set a record. In all, nine Chevies will have led the pack. Four of them, including the 1967 original, have been Camaros.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Before the Balls, Some Supper","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/style/evening-hours-before-the-balls-some-supper.html","abstract":"  There was food and art for 1,000 at the National Gallery of Art on Jan. 20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"A Synergy of Ecology And Photography","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/style/camera-a-synergy-of-ecology-and-photography.html","abstract":"  PHOTOGRAPHERS, like seeds in a rich environment, take root, grow and prosper.

To be fair, this teen-age runaway turned bohemian darling did strike a pose before the cameras of almost every major photographer who crossed his path: Robert Doisneau, Arnold Newman, Paul Strand, Irving Penn, Philippe Halsman. As shown in the collection JEAN COCTEAU: The Mirror and the Mask (Godine, cloth, $40; paper, $24.95), Cocteau invariably affected a neurasthenic vulnerability -- the latter-day Rimbaud look -- but the effect of that look changed radically over the years. At first it glamorized a sexy young dandy (in an anonymous vacation snapshot taken when he was 26), an elegant    artiste    (in a Man Ray portrait taken when Cocteau was 33) and a stylish prankster (in Berenice Abbot's gangster-with-gun shot, taken when he was 38). But Cocteau's fame caught up with him, and the photographs became less about him and more about the elements of his much-cultivated image: the veined hands, the troubled eyes, the tense mouth. Of Cocteau's later portraitists, only Cecil Beaton and Jacques-Henri Lartigue picked up on how small he seemed to feel, how defeated by the world around him. The introduction by the book's editor, Julie Paul, the owner of a New York City art gallery, and the sketch by Francis Steegmuller, the author of a biography of Cocteau, are informative, but they tend to enforce the myth of Cocteau -- the unflappable showman, the quintessential celebrity -- that the photographs themselves do a lot to undo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"All's Quiet on Western New York Front","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/sports/pro-football-all-s-quiet-on-western-new-york-front.html","abstract":"  The week leading up to the Super Bowl is an endless carnival.

Now the Laurence Miller Gallery in SoHo, in association with One Bond/Michael Senft, presents eyes, just eyes, in a show called \"Eye for I.\"   This small show of 22 pictures (through Feb. 12) is actually the gallery's second feature. The front room has work by Toshio Shibata, a Japanese landscape photographer with a cool, refined sense of formality, most recently on view in the \"New Photography 8\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Landscape is a plausible and long-established pretext for a show, but eyes? In fact, photographers have paid a great deal of attention to eyes, and highlighting that interest amounts to a perfectly respectable, even a piquant thing to do, although this little collection cannot quite keep up to the charm of its own better moments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Impresario For Young Garners Recognition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/nyregion/impresario-for-young-garners-recognition.html","abstract":"AFTER 24 years of creating children's musicals that have entertained generations of youngsters, the artistic director of the Fantasy Playhouse, Barbara Schaap, has finally been \"discovered.\"\n\nA dozen of her works will be featured in a national catalogue distributed by Encore Performance Publishing to 10,000 schools and theaters, which can then buy the rights to produce the plays.

Translated by Suzanne Jill Levine. (Norton, $8.95.) The Argentine author's last novel, published posthumously, concerns two elderly sisters in Rio de Janeiro who become embroiled in their neighbors' lives. Set in the late 1980's, it is told completely through dialogue, correspondence and police reports. \"Manuel Puig delivers his exit lines with great grace, good humor and much wisdom,\" Robert Houston said here in 1991.   FORTUNATE SON: The Autobiography of Lewis B. Puller Jr. (Bantam, $5.99.) At first there seems to be little that is fortunate in the life of Lewis B. Puller Jr. Son of the much-decorated Marine general Lewis Burwell (Chesty) Puller, the author went off to Vietnam in 1968 for a tour that was brief but brutal: three months into his stay, he stepped on a booby-trapped howitzer round, losing his legs and part of both hands. His book, which won a 1991 Pulitzer Prize, chronicles his long struggle to heal physically and psychologically. Our reviewer, William Styron, said: \"Because Mr. Puller writes with simplicity and candor, with touches of spontaneous humor, his outcry of agony and isolation, while harrowing, leaves one primarily overwhelmed with wonder at the torture a human being can absorb this side of madness.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Christina McCoy, Shereef H.

Indeed, the 86-year-old Huntington, one of the region's more storied resort hotels, is frequently overlooked by Angelenos who, as a rule, tend to spend weekends at the beach in the summer and the desert in the winter.    Pasadena, about 25 miles inland from the Pacific and perhaps best known for its annual Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day (and this month Super Bowl XXVII), tends to be ignored the rest of the year. Yet, this anonymity wasn't always the case. Indeed, the Huntington, now under the management of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, had originally been a fashionable winter resort. When Henry Huntington, a wealthy Pasadena resident, bought the Hotel Wentworth in 1911, renamed and expanded it, including the installation of a pool, the Huntington became a popular November-to-May watering hole where Easterners and Midwesterners could hobnob with Hollywood royalty while acquiring out-of-season tans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Elizabeth Meuller, David N.

This has nothing to do with the new staging, which is part of the Met's attempt to establish a traditional-Wagner in residence. The Met is setting the work precisely where Wagner wanted it: in 16th-century Nuremberg, where members of the various occupational guilds came together to create an elite organization of singing masters, heirs to a long tradition.   The source of discomfort is the opera itself. Music critics might justifiably feel disconcerted because of their resemblance to Beckmesser, the pedantic town clerk and master of \"Die Meistersinger.\" Critics (like Beckmesser) judge newcomers (like the opera's young aspirant, Walther), who claim nobility and immense musical gifts and wish to be declared Masters of the Art. They act as \"Markers\" -- stern graders slashing chalk across slates -- citing every supposedly broken rule, sometimes attacking fellow Markers with similar narrow-mindedness. Beckmesser can't actually create beauty himself; all he can do is find flaws, judging the new by the old. In an early draft of the text, Beckmesser was called Hanslich, after the powerful critic, Eduard Hanslick, who dared to criticize Wagner. Hanslick was actually at the composer's 1862 reading of the \"Meistersinger\" text; he stormed out in anger.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Merchant-Ivory and Friends: On the Job Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/movies/film-merchant-ivory-and-friends-on-the-job-again.html","abstract":"  Deep in rural Gloucestershire is the village of Badminton, famous not only because it gave the world the game that still bears its name but also because it contains the ancestral home of the Dukes of Beaufort.

The cataracts, 275 in all, are collectively known as the Iguacu Falls and are situated in a bend of the Iguacu River between Brazil and Argentina. They're big and powerful but, more important, they are heart-wrenchingly beautiful.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Anne Walton, Andrew Stenzler","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/style/engagements-anne-walton-andrew-stenzler.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Stanley A.

Previous exhibitors have included artists on the order of Marguerite Doernbach, but the present incumbent, William Knight, is a lesser-known, albeit with many appearances in group shows to his credit.   To the degree that he seizes upon trees as living organisms, Mr. Knight evokes Charles Burchfield -- but fleetingly so, for there is no anthropomorphism here. The dark trunks of junipers rise against a lemon yellow sky. Coniferous growth in colors ranging from dark green to yellow and silver gray seems to shudder as it casts long, dark shadows; not for nothing does the artist call his subjects \"Vital Trees.\"    Although Mr. Knight has yet to achieve consistency of surface and the brushstroke that \"speaks,\" it is plain that there lurks in him an Expressionist awaiting release.   The show closes on Friday; the gallery is on the campus at 171 Broadmead. Hours are 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. Monday through Friday.

Whether or not this is so, Frankel Nathanson, scarcely two months old, seems already to have put down a root in Maplewood, at 9 Highland Place -- and without recourse to either crafts or frame making.    That the dealer, Marjorie Nathanson, brings with her a whiff of Manhattan may be because she was an assistant curator at the Museum of Modern Art and a consultant at Sotheby Parke Bernet. Wisely, though, she is still testing the New Jersey waters -- with prints, mostly by well-known contemporaries.   Jim Dine leads the way with a 1976 etching of the Eiffel Tower exploding like an oil well above the words, \"Paris Smiles\" in sans-serif lettering. He is accompanied by Frank Stella in his \"lyrical\" Minimalist mode with a 1973 lithograph of two striped squares, one black and white, the other in color.   With the appearance of William Brice's small etchings, monochrome and colored, emerges a hint of the dealer's preference -- for small shapes drawn in fine lines and suspended against smudgy backgrounds. Grace Markham, an artist new to this observer, achieves a similar effect in \"Foxtrot,\" a rectangle in which shapes -- a house, vegetation and possibly clouds -- hang like doodles touched here and there with color.    Then come the political comedians, Komar and Melamid. These Russian-born artists contribute a 1983 silk screen of a red banner reading \"Thank You Comrade Stalin for Our Happy Childhood.\" They are also responsible for a black and white silk screen of a repaired Venus de Milo, armed with a hammer and sickle.   Tom Marioni's color woodblock of the pi symbol, printed in blood red on white silk, looks as Oriental as \"Flying Yen\" in the same medium. But neither symbol offers clues to the artist's past as the enfant terrible of Bay Area Conceptualism.   In his book on San Francisco art, Thomas Albright tells how Mr. Marioni, given $500 to produce an installation for a Jesuit university, spent $350 of it on an old Fiat and the rest on invitations to the show, which he titled \"My First Car.\" Having driven the vehicle up the gallery steps, Mr. Marioni parked, contending that the church should support artists as it had during the Renaissance. The show lasted one day.   A British sculptor known for his shapes compiled of plastic junk, Tony Cragg is here represented by \"Suburbs I, III and V,\" all of them pale color etchings of rubber stamps congregating as if they were figures by de Chirico.   The most recent works in the selection are Joel Shapiro's 1992 aquatints of colored slabs that are formally related to his sculptures but do not evoke them. Yvonne Jacquette's aerial view of Skowhegan in black and white is a bit humdrum, but her \"Clouds Obscuring San Diego,\" which looks like a pastel but is billed as a color etching, is an enticing mass of purplish-brown laced with necklaces of colored dots for lights.   The show runs through Feb. 17. The gallery is open from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Wednesday through Saturday and until 8 P.M. Thursday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"5 Local Brews Make Their Debut","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/nyregion/5-local-brews-make-their-debut.html","abstract":"SHORTLY before 11 A.M., Mike Malone walked over to a table inside the Hamilton Park Ale House in Jersey City and set down a six-pack of beer. He then placed three glasses on the table, popped the bottle tops and poured. \n\n\"Sit,\" he said. \"It's 12 o'clock somewhere in the world.\"\n\nMr. Malone and his partner and childhood friend, Will Costine, poured some Hoboken Special Reserve Ale. It had a somewhat darker color and sharper taste than many commercial brands. They found it to their liking, and no wonder: they invented it. \n\nHoboken Ale, introduced in December 1991, is one of five local brews to hit the New Jersey market since 1987. The beers have close connections to New Jersey, although none are currently brewed here. (Hoboken Ale is made at the Gold Coast Brewery in Connecticut.) \n\nAll the local brands have seen growing sales, a fact that their owners attribute to their products' local appeal, their individuality and a growing public demand for more taste.\nA Question of Flavor\n\n \"The American beers tend to be very thin and watery, with little flavor,\" said Michael Miller of Mount Laurel, who started Goldfinch Amber Beer in June. \"There has been a movement here in the United States to try to get a European taste.\"\n\nGoldfinch, named after the state bird, is the newest of the local brews. Since its introduction, Mr. Miller said, it has stabilized its sales at about 800 cases a month. By comparison, Anheuser-Busch in Newark sold an estimated 11 million cases a month in the greater New York-New Jersey area last year, said Frank McGuire, an Anheuser-Busch spokesman.\n\n\"With the first batch I brewed, I was pleased with the taste,\" said Mr. Miller, a former financial analyst who now works in the beer business full time.\n\nBut he said it took him a little more than a year before he had the final recipe. He said he had made many trips to the brewery in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to develop the production.\n\nBottle caps are being popped all over the state: Jersey Lager hit the market in July 1987; two years ago the New Jersey owners sold the brand to Lion Inc. in Wilkes-Barre, said Lion's chief executive, Bill Smulowitz. Diving Horse Lager Beer, introduced by Michael Gallo of Northfield in May 1990, is also brewed by Lion.\n\nSaratoga Lager Beer, partly owned by Chuck Schroeder of Englewood, started distributing its product in New York in October 1991 and came to New Jersey four months later. Though named after the city in northeastern York, the beer is brewed at the Catamount Brewing Company in Vermont.\nHope to Build Breweries\n\n The local beers' owners said they hoped to build breweries in New Jersey. But that would cost $2 million to $6 million, depending on the size, said Mr. Miller, adding that he first wanted to make sure his brand had a big enough market.\n\nThe only beer brewery in New Jersey is the Anheuser-Busch plant in Newark, said Nando Avila, assistant to the director of the State Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Mr. McGuire said the brewery, which produces the company's national brands, is running at capacity.\n\nThe owners of the local beers said they hoped to see brew pubs, where their brews could be both made and sold at retail prices, established in New Jersey.\n\n\"A brew pub is a good way of promoting a product,\" Mr. Gallo said. \"People like to see things being made, and they can try it fresh. Then when they try it, they go to the store and buy it if they like it.\"\n\nSuch operations are illegal in New Jersey. But State Senator John Ewing, Republican of Bedminster,introduced a bill in March authorizing the operation of brew pubs in the state. The measure is still in a Senate committee. \n\n\"Tax proceeds generated from that legislation would go to the Alliance to Prevent Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, part of the Governor's Council on Alcoholism,\" Mr. Avila said.\nLegal in 40 States\n\n Brew pubs are legal in 40 states, including New York and Connecticut, said David Edgar, assistant director of the Institute for Brewing Studies, a division of the Association of Brewers in Colorado. Besides New Jersey, he said, legislation is also being considered in Texas, Hawaii and Michigan.\n\n\"If the brew pub law changes, I would consider opening a brewery here,\" Mr. Gallo said. \"It's more profitable, and it attracts tourists.\"\n\nIn 1980 the nation had only 40 breweries, Mr. Edgar said; now there are 340. Of the 1,700 new labels introduced since 1980, he said, about 80 percent of them are local. \n\nThe two major selling points of local beers, Mr. Edgar said, are that they are grass-roots operations and that their flavors are fuller than those of the mass-produced brands.\n\nOn a recent weekend night in Hoboken, home to more than 100 bars and restaurants, a couple stared into the window of Helmers', a German and American restaurant on Washington Street. About 70 beer bottles lined three shelves behind the glass, among them Hoboken Ale and Saratoga Lager. \n\nThe bartender, Richard Lueders, wiped the counter and said Saratoga wasn't a big seller. It needs more promotion, he said. But he added that Hoboken Ale \"holds its own\" with the 95 varieties of beer that Helmers' carries.\n\n\"It sells with women or men,\" Mr. Lueders said. \"Women, for the most part, don't like heavy beers, while men generally like more full-flavored beers. Hoboken Ale has a perfect balance.\"\nGrandmother's Recipe\n\n Though Mr. Lueders admitted that some customers were disappointed when they found out that Hoboken Ale is not brewed in New Jersey, he said he sold about half a case a week and did get repeat business for the brand.\n\nFive years ago, Mr. Malone said, he found his grandmother's 142-year-old recipe for beer in the attic of his Chatham home. After several years of testing, searching for the right brewer and investing $150,000, he introduced Hoboken Ale.\n\nInitially the brand sold 300 cases a month. Now it sells at least 900, Mr. Costine said. \"We hope to break even by the middle of next year,\" he said. \n\nTheir bottle is transparent brown with a cream-colored label drawn by Mr. Costine, a graphic designer. A red clipper ship called the Hurricane, built in Hoboken in 1851, splashes the top of the label. \n\n\"The crews that rode those type of ships were tough,\" Mr. Costine said. \"These guys would go to the bars in Hoboken and recount their stories. This is the same type of ale they drank in those days.\"\n\nThe five local brews differ in taste and appearance. Goldfinch has a purple label and is denser in flavor than Jersey Lager, which is wrapped in a neon-bright label. The Saratoga Lager bottle depicts a horse running across an open field. Diving Horse is trimmed in gold. \n'Almost Like a Fraternity'\n\n The owners say that if one local beer is successful, a customer is more likely to sample other handmade brews. \n\n\"We don't consider ourselves competitive with the others because we each make a different beer,\" Mr. Schroeder, the Saratoga Lager Beer part owner, said. \n\nHis wife, Lyn, added, \"It's almost like a fraternity.\" \n\nIn his Englewood kitchen, Mr. Schroeder said he was attracted to the beer business after visiting a Detroit brewery in the late 1960's. He said the smell was fresh, like that of cooking.\n\n\"It was a yeast smell,\" he said. \"It's difficult to put into words, but I'll never forget it.\"\n\nMr. Schroeder moved to Englewood from New York in 1965. He said he needed more space to house his three motorcycles. While he first considered his New Jersey residence \"a place to sleep,\" he said, the state has become his home.\n\n\nSaratoga Lager is the only local brew in New Jersey that is also sold outside the state. Mr. Schroeder said it took four months to move the beer into New Jersey, because \"we don't have the marketing money.\" His initial $100,000 investment would have been more, he said, if he didn't own his own advertising company.\n\nThe bulk of Mr. Schroeder's product is sold in central New York, including Saratoga County and Albany, he said. Sales have risen to 1,200 cases a month from 800 a month at the start. \n\n\"A lot of men love the idea of being in the beer business,\" Mr. Schroeder said. \"They love beer, and they say it looks like it's going to be fun.\"\nStories of Diving Horses\n\n For Mr. Gallo, an executive of a credit card processing company, getting involved in the beer business seemed natural. He was a bartender when he was in college, he said, and in the late 1980's, when he was manager of transportation for the Trump casinos in Atlantic City, he often heard the stories of the horses and riders who would dive into a 12-foot-deep pool of water on the Steel Pier.\n\n\"The first thing I thought was that it would take me a lot of beer to do that,\" he said. \n\nInspired by the legend, the Diving Horse label features a blond woman in a red bathing suit on horseback over a pool of water. Diving Horse is sold in bottles, as are the other four local beers, but it is the only one also sold on draft.\n\nFor now, Mr. Gallo said, he is satisfied with his profits. He invested $100,000 with help from his three brothers to get Diving Horse started, and any money made is put back into the business, he said. Since the beer first hit the market, sales have stabilized at 500 cases per month. \n\n\"When the economy picks up, people will have a little more money to spend on good beer, so we're definitely going to hang in there,\" Mr. Gallo said. \"Right now, we're having fun.\"\nBeer: Reading All About It\n\n IN December 1991, a month after home brewing was legalized in New Jersey, Jack and Laurie Babin were driving home to Bergenfield from an office Christmas party when the couple came up with the idea for a beer lovers' newspaper.\n\n\"I was kind of fed up working for a lot of people,\" said Mr. Babin, who was employed by a computer company. \"The home brewing law woke people up. The next thing was that if someone needed information, where could they get it?\"\n\nOn a recent Saturday, Mr. Babin looked at the top half of his newspaper's cover, which featured a drawing of an old-fashioned street filled with saloons. A silhouetted view of the Manhattan skyline shared space on the page.\n\nIn the basement his home, several desks were covered with articles pasted to layout sheets, as Mr. Babin and his brother-in-law, Tony Forder, were putting together the third issue of Ale Street News. The newspaper, begun in July, comes out every other month. It focuses on beer and everything a reader might want to know about the beverage, from home brewing tips to reviews.\n\n\n\"The timing has been perfect,\" Mr. Babin said. \"We found the level of interest of hand-crafted beers and home brewing was beginning to come into the New York area, but there was no single source of information.\"\n\nThe paper, which Mr. Babin said was the largest of its kind on the East Coast, is distributed free at pubs, breweries, liquor stores, delis and home brew suppliers.  Ale Street News, Mr. Babib said, has doubled its distribution to 40,000 copies an issue.\n\n\"It has been a definite benefit for the beer connoisseur and the home brewer in finding out new information on beer and the beer industry,\" said Tom Clark, owner of Red Bank Brewing Supply in Red Bank.\n\nUnderneath the newspaper's title, the phrase \"Your open tap on beer 'hoppenings' in the New York metro area\" runs across the page.\n\nThe December cover featured an article about the founder of the American Home Brewers Association in Colorado. Inside, reviews of beers filled several of the 24 pages. Some of the articles were written by Mr. Forder, who also works for a weekly newspaper in Essex County. \n\n\"We knew there was an interest out there,\" he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Plan the Kitchen and Avoid Pitfalls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/nyregion/plan-the-kitchen-and-avoid-pitfalls.html","abstract":"  READY-TO-ASSEMBLE kitchen cabinets make remodeling a kitchen much easier than when cabinets were just available ready-made or built to order by a cabinetmaker.

But on a recent return it began to register on me that the city no longer corresponds to my callow recollections. I think it was the rabbits that shocked me into recognition. Landing at Charles de Gaulle Airport after an all-night flight, I gazed groggily out the window and noticed that the grassy patches beside the runway were aswarm with rabbits. Suddenly, like Alice falling through the looking glass, I tumbled into an altogether new place and realized that Paris is today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930124","headline":"Hold The Champagne","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/24/theater/l-david-mamet-hold-the-champagne-463493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   David Richards claims that the strength of Carol in \"Oleanna\" is an advancement for David Mamet's women.
