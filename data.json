The \"Buddy Boys\" case is the department's first major corruption scandal since the Knapp Commission exposed organized \"pads\" that ran extortion operations out of nearly every precinct house. It was out of the Knapp Commission that the Internal Affairs Division was born. Oct. 31, 1986: Twenty-seven supervisors are transferred out of the precinct by Commissioner Benjamin Ward, but no need is seen for an investigation of the department's anti-corruption efforts. March 1991: Apparently no corruption troubles are in sight. The state disbands the office of Special Prosecutor for corruption and agres to give money to the district attorneys to fight corruption. To date, only a fraction of the money promised has been delivered. May 7, 1992: A group of six New York City police officers, led by Officer Michael Dowd, are arrested for cocaine trafficking by the Suffolk County police, raising a host of questions about oversign and the Blue Wall of Silence. Why didn't the department's own investigators uncover the scandal in light of flagrant misconduct over many years by Officer Dowd? Had the department looked the other way? One person, anyway, sees no major cracks. Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown calls the department's system for weeding out corruption \"a system that police agencies across the country look to.\" June 25, 1992: Mayor David N. Dinkins announces the creation of a special panel to investigate corruption, and as its head, names Milton Mollen, a former judge and former Deputy Mayor for public safety, as well as a close friend. Commissioner Brown, who opposed the panel, was conspicuously absent from the announcement. June 29, 1992: Commissioner Brown finally acknowledges a problem. He announces tougher anti-corruption measures that on the surface seem rather basic. Investigators will finally be supplied with modern surveillance equipment and even new cars that will help them avoid detection from officers under scrutiny. He also asks his top deputy, Raymond W. Kelly, to prepare a report on why the department failed to stop Officer Dowd. But law enforcement officials say the response is too late, that the Internal Affairs Division had been bungling cases for years. One officials calls it a \"secret waiting to come out.\" July 30, 1992: More problems for Michael Dowd. He is arrested on Federal charges that he took huge weekly cash payments from drug gangs. Officials say he offered protection from police raids and in return took in as much as $8,000 a week. Nov. 16, 1992: Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announces a major revamping of the Internal Affairs monitoring system, starting with an upgrading of its status to Internal Affairs Bureau and creating more accountability among investigators. Mollen Commission officials say the changes do not go nearly far enough. Sept. 27, 1993: The Mollen Commission begins the city's first public hearings on police corruption in more than 20 years with a star witness: Michael Dowd. He says that early in his career other officers indoctrinated him with the attitude: \"never rat against another cop.\" There is testimony from a hooded informant named \"Mr. X\" and from former police officials and investigators who reveal tales of corruption and brutality in the 9th Precinct in the East Village and in many of the city's minority communities. It is learned that Internal Affairs has long maintained a secret \"tickler\" file for charges made against its own investigators, rather than pass the allegations on to prosecutors. Dec. 28, 1993: An interim report released by the Mollen Commission is a sign of things to come. The commission declares the department \"incompetent\" in policing itself. March 8, 1994: The commission produces its first criminal case when three officers from the 73d Precinct in Brownsville are charged with dealing drugs, usually while on duty. The officers called themselves the Morgue Boys because they often met divide their profits outside a factory that had once manufactured refrigerators for morgues. March 18, 1994: Three officers from the 30th Precinct are caught on videotape beating up Harlem residents and stealing drugs and cash. Eleven more officers from the precinct will eventually be arrested. And another new police commissioner, William J. Bratton, tries to put his own stamp on the corruption battle. He pronounces that no one will ever wear the badges of the arrested officers. To date, he has transferred eight of 22 supervisors from the precinct, as well as 25 of the precinct's 191 officers, many on suspicions that they knew about corruption but did not tell. July 6, 1994: The Commission's final report is issued. Its central proposal is the creation of an independent commission, appointed by the Mayor, to review police department efforts to eliminate corruption and to conduct its own investigations.

This White House team knows how to upstage a Presidential trip. When Mr. Clinton was in Europe for D-Day observances, all eyes were on North Korea. Now, as he visits Poland, comes news that commando units of the United States Army and Navy have been practicing a takeover of Haiti's ports and airfields.   It is hard to believe that the Pentagon's willingness to discuss these \"secret\" maneuvers is not part of a plan to flush Gen. Raoul Cedras and his henchmen out of Haiti. That is a worthy goal, but the timing is amateurish and the underlying message is troubling. Washington and the United Nations have only recently gotten serious about enforcing meaningful economic sanctions. These need to be given a chance to produce political results. And a new refugee initiative unveiled Tuesday at least temporarily relieves the political pressure from that direction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Balkan War-Crimes Prosecution Bogs Down","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/world/balkan-war-crimes-prosecution-bogs-down.html","abstract":"  More than a year after the United Nations created a tribunal to punish war crimes in Croatia and Bosnia, no cases have been brought and Russia, Serbia's historic ally, is blocking efforts to name a chief prosecutor, American officials say.

The Senator seemed to be speaking not just as a politician but as a Jew.    Is it coincidence that Mr. Specter, the only Jewish Republican Senator, is one of the very few G.O.P. leaders who have dared criticize the Christian right? Hardly. If you are an American Jew, you have every reason to worry about a political movement whose most powerful leader, Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition, calls the constitutional separation of church and state \"a lie of the left\" and vows to dismantle it.

The information superhighway. It's all there, examined in vivid detail. There is also a thought or two about the rapacious character of advertising.    Back when advertising was still in its crib, Mr. Dick correctly forecast that it would someday be a consuming force. In the world of \"Blade Runner,\" skyscrapers are covered top to bottom with television screens that scream with ads 24 hours a day. Commercials no longer sit still and beg to be looked at. Instead, they become fly-like robots that perch on the pillow and whisper sweet nothings while you sleep. The next morning you wake up craving foods you've never eaten. Mr. Dick's characters defend themselves by keeping their windows closed -- and making heavy use of fly swatters. The idea is to get them before they get to you.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Let Taiwan First Give Up Its Claims to China","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/opinion/l-let-taiwan-first-give-up-its-claims-to-china-605875.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   You illustrate the desperate attempts of Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, to develop relations between Taiwan and other nations in a June 26 news article, pointing out the obstacle of mainland China's refusal to allow the global recognition of Taiwan.

What is not clear is whether they are animal, vegetable or mineral.   As the title suggests, such ambiguity is very much to the point. Pilobolus, at its most antic, has always had trouble distinguishing mankind from plant life. The company's name, if one needs reminding, refers to a fungus that inclines toward the light. On the instant, this image became a metaphor for a style of dancing that is based on leverage and leaning and, by extension, mutual support.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"Reporter's Notebook; Growing Up in the Melting Pot Called Hope, Ark.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/world/reporter-s-notebook-growing-up-in-the-melting-pot-called-hope-ark.html","abstract":"  Today was the first time Bill Clinton had ever laid eyes on Poland and the Baltics.

The concerts are badly presented, usually fueled by that most tired of formulas, the tribute. They never address any of jazz's hot topics, nor do they, like Lincoln Center's jazz program (and the American Jazz Orchestra before it), indulge in programming that finds its backbone in a theme. Nevertheless, over and over again, the festival pulls off a handful of concerts that are truly special.   This year's festival was no exception, and most of the epiphanies came from the least likely places. A concert built around the pianist Dick Hyman, a fine player and historian but hardly known for his transcendental abilities, turned out to be, well, transcendental. Mel Torme, the 68-year-old singer, performed a concert full of bravura and showmanship and stunning musicality, which was a pleasure both for the musicians and the audience. And at what could have been a jam session run amok, last Friday night's tribute to the Rev. John Garcia Gensel, the pastor to the jazz world, the constantly shifting group of improvisers maintained a level of music that's often found in clubs but rarely on concert stages.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940707","headline":"The Demon Donor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/opinion/the-demon-donor.html","abstract":"  Ross Perot rails so loudly against the special interests that it is easy to forget he is one.

Now we are accustomed to experiencing completeness not only on paper but in performance and on recordings as well. The coming centennial of the death of Verdi, in 2001, has inspired at least two surveys of Verdi's operatic canon, one by Covent Garden and one by the more modestly proportioned New York Grand Opera. The New York series began on Wednesday night with a performance of Verdi's \"Oberto\" in Central Park.   The value of this sort of endeavor depends on the case at hand. With a composer like Brahms, who edited his own work severely and maintained an astonishing consistency of inspiration, a complete-works survey is revelatory. A volcanically prolific figure like Schubert, on the other hand, makes a rather overwhelming and wearying effect in concentrated chronological doses. (I've experienced both in radio presentations.) Verdi falls somewhere in between; some of his operas are unquestionably better than others, the last operas tower majestically above the first, and yet even the most obscure works have something singular and satisfying about them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"A Sour Note on Concert Prices","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/opinion/a-sour-note-on-concert-prices.html","abstract":"  Pearl Jam, a \"grunge\" rock band out of Seattle, wanted to please its largely teen-age audience by setting ticket prices for a summer tour under $20 -- far below the usual prices of $50 to $60.

One of tonight's opening features, the alluring, little-known 1937 film \"Gueule d'Amour,\" features Jean Gabin as a Foreign Legionnaire in the south of France. Known as Lover Boy (Gueule d'Amour), he has the society matrons complaining; in the last six months they have lost nine maids, all distracted by his charms. Even now, on screen, it's easy to see why women would have followed the dashing Gabin into the desert.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"Storm-Tossed on a Sea of Emotions; New York's Haitians Feel Betrayed, Angry and Confused by New Policy on Refugees","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/nyregion/storm-tossed-sea-emotions-new-york-s-haitians-feel-betrayed-angry-confused-new.html","abstract":"  Abner Celestine sees only danger in the desperate sea voyages that so many of his fellow Haitians have embarked upon in recent weeks, and has even written to his three brothers in Haiti warning against such risks.

Lohr, a 10-year PGA Tour veteran with just one victory, offset a three-putt bogey with 11 birdies at Kingsmill Golf Club. \"Just a great round,\" Lohr said. \"I've never made 11 birdies in a round before.\"   \"I don't think I'd even know how to pencil in a 61,\" said Nike Tour regular John Wilson, whose 64 put him in a second-place tie with PGA Tour rookie Glen Day.

He has been running his own show as Prospect Park's resident storyteller for the last two summers. He was discovered, he said, by Betsy Gotbaum, the former Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation, and Tupper Thomas, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance. He said they saw him informally performing in the park and wanted to sign him up, but they didn't know for what. Then the storytelling job, sponsored by the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation, turned up, and he was hired as a raconteur. (Keats was a children's book author and illustrator in the 1960's and 70's whose settings were mostly urban.)   Cooper-Moore's storytelling sessions begin with parables or riddles, move to a medium-length tale and finish with a longish tale, all folk stories he has mostly heard from others. There were the Polish and Czech workers in the building where he lives in East Harlem who told him stories. Tales repeated by African neighbors have also enhanced his repertory. Then there's the baby a friend of his has recently adopted from China, who may come on Sunday, and for whom he will dig up stories. \"I've been reading Chinese meditations and the country's history,\" he said in his ribbon-smooth accent from the Piedmont region of Virginia.   His storytelling turns eclectic when accompanied by his songs, which he writes and plays on his hand-made instruments. \"This year, I'll be writing songs for each program,\" he says. What more could a child ask for on a Sunday afternoon? (Ice cream.)   The free storytelling is on Sundays at 1 and 2 P.M. through Aug. 28. The D train, stopping at Prospect Park, is the closest subway. Another free storytelling program is held on Mondays and Thursdays at the Third Street Playground (entrance at Prospect Park West and Third Street; Park Slope side) at 4 P.M. daily except Mondays through Aug. 1.   In Central Park, storytellers have been congregating at the Hans Christian Andersen statue for 37 years; Diane Wolkstein, the director, is in her 27th year. The stories told there on Saturdays from 11 A.M. to noon are not just those of Andersen, but also tales from the Grimm brothers, along with stories from Borneo, Haiti and China.   Tomorrow, Marcia Lane and Ulf Arnstrom are to be telling Scandinavian stories. Ms. Lane is to start with Hans Christian Andersen's story \"The Collar,\" in which a man's shirt collar seeks a wife. He romances a comb, an iron and scissors, but is turned down flat. He ends up being made into paper, upon which his story is written. \"Isn't that like life?\" Ms. Lane added.   Mr. Arnstrom, an editor of a Swedish storytelling journal, is flying in from Stockholm to tell Swedish folk tales in his soft, gentle voice. His program, in English, is to center on \"The Pearl,\" in which three women claim ownership of a lustrous sea gem. Whoever makes the biggest fool of her husband gets the pearl. (What a sense of humor Scandinavians can have.)   The free programs, held rain or shine, run through Sept. 24. Adults are asked to remain with their children. 'A Lady Named Jo'    Queens Children's Theater   256-21 Union Turnpike, at 257th Street   Glen Oaks   (718) 343-1052   Recommended ages: 7 and up   Through Sunday    Jo and her sisters, from Louisa May Alcott's novel \"Little Women,\" all appear in this musical for children, only they're less agreeable. \"The ultrasweetness in the book has been removed,\" said Ben Finn, who wrote the play's book with Peter John Stephens. That may come as a relief to some potential audience members, although children, especially girls, fall in love with the March sorority no matter what. The story is told from Jo's perspective as a middle-aged woman looking back.   This play has 23 songs on a recorded track, making the production seem almost operatic. The two-hour show (with an intermission), is tonight at 7 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 P.M. Tickets are $10; $6 for children. From July 20 to 24, it is to be performed at Inner-Space Theater, 134 West 26th Street, Chelsea; information: (212) 989-2969. Model Ship Sailing   Chess and Backgammon    Bryant Park   Avenue of the Americas, at 40th Street   (212) 983-4142   Recommended ages: 3 and up   Through October    Three years ago, Robbie Biederman had an enterprising idea, and his father, Dan Biederman, the executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, took action. Inspiration blew in when Robbie, who is now 7, was visiting the Luxembourg Gardens and the Tuileries during a family vacation in Paris. Why couldn't children race model sailboats in the Bryant Park fountain back home in New York City?   \"I thought it was too small,\" Mr. Biederman said of the Josephine Shaw Lowell fountain, \"but we tested some boats and it turned out to be a perfect size.\" Patina Milon, an 8-year-old from New York City, spent a half hour one day last week circling the pink-granite fountain with her rented model Henley, the jib luffing uncontrollably.   The model sailboats, which may be rented for $2 an hour, are attached with strings for navigating. The boats were made and lent by Fred Hutchins, the owner of Jan's Hobby Shop on the Upper East Side. Two boats were stolen a few weeks ago, leaving only three.   Bryant Park is also offering chess and backgammon lessons and sets to rent for games at the Parisian cafe-style chairs and tables. (The park really does have a Gallic air, even though the fountain is Italian Renaissance style and is named after an American suffragist.) The New York Chess and Backgammon club is the sponsor. A free lesson is arranged for first-time players; thereafter, you may pay from $30 to $100 for an hour's lesson with masters, senior masters and grandmasters. If you simply wish to play, the fees are 50 cents a game for each player for speed chess (10 minutes or less); $4 an hour for each player for slow chess (more than 20 minutes); 50 cents a game for each player for backgammon, and $4 an hour for each player for checkers.   The sailing, lessons and games are daily from 11:30 A.M. to sundown, weather permitting. They are at the 41st Street entrance. Lessons may be scheduled by calling the club at (212) 302-5874. Little West Street Path    West Street at West Thames Street   Battery Park City   Lower Manhattan   (212) 416-5300   Recommended for all ages    A new pathway for in-line skaters, bicyclists (with and without training wheels), tricyclists, runners, dogs, roller skaters and skateboarders has been created along the West Side Highway, almost along the waterfront. Crickets can be heard at dusk in the shrubs behind the wrought-iron fence; a breeze slips in from the Hudson. The straightaway, as flat as a mesa top and illuminated at night, allows no cars. It is four blocks long and has sidewalks on both sides; a cul-de-sac has benches. The pathway will ultimately be a service road for buildings going up on adjacent empty lots, so enjoy it while it lasts.   Not far away, at the Vesey Street entrance to Hudson River Park, the New York City Police Department's Troop A mounted unit exercises its horses in a new ring, usually every morning or afternoon. (There is no set schedule.) If you're lucky, you can see the horses doing serpentines and figure eights, but not chasing bad guys.   And have you checked out the new 27-foot-wide pathway in the West Village, running from Little West 12th Street to Harrison Street off the West Side Highway? One TriBeCa mother said it had changed her life, as she can now glide safely on her in-line skates to retrieve her car at a parking lot. For now, the pathway, part of the Hudson River Park Conservancy's urban boulevard plan, ends at the northern end of Hudson River Park, at Stuyvesant High School. Other skaters have already discovered the path, but there's room for everyone. An attractive fence keeps you from stumbling into the river, although the fence is completed only down to Hubert Street; a concrete wall separates the path from the highway. A lot of people use the route at sunset.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"Top Spot Remains Yankee Domain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/sports/baseball-top-spot-remains-yankee-domain.html","abstract":"  The Yankees were getting more tense, more nervous and more paranoid than normal as their losses escalated, their division lead disintegrated and their lack of fans at Yankee Stadium received increased exposure.

Pre-Impressionists, Impressionists, Fauves and Pointillists alike were successively drawn to its dramatic coastlines and seaside villages and resorts. Further inland lies Giverny, which many American Impressionists, following the path of Monet, began to visit in the late 1880's.

It is as if something were crumbling, decaying and exhausting itself, while something else, still indistinct, were arising from the rubble.   The distinguishing features of transitional periods are a mixing and blending of cultures and a plurality or parallelism of intellectual and spiritual worlds. These are periods when all consistent value systems collapse, when cultures distant in time and space are discovered or rediscovered. New meaning is gradually born from the encounter, or the intersection, of many different elements.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940708","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/nyregion/c-corrections-613886.html","abstract":"  An article on June 29 about new Federal guidelines for treating congestive heart failure misstated the toll-free telephone number for obtaining copies of the guidelines.

Dancing in the Streets, which produces the summer series now, encourages choreographers to make pieces for the setting.   There are good and bad things to be said for each approach. Movement and set came together in inspired new ways during \"Journey,\" a suite of eight pieces presented by the Prowess Dancearts Collective on Wednesday afternoon, in the opening program of the Dances for Wave Hill series.

The effect was inseparable from the magnitude of the sound and image. It was rock for a big audience in a huge space.   Alternative rock and its forebear, punk, were once hostile to arena-rock, which was seen as an impersonal, commodified version of the real thing. But that was before Nirvana and before Lollapalooza itself, which made alternative-rockers realize that their audience was far larger than they expected.

Coming on top of sizable upward revisions in the number of jobs created in April and May, the report seemed likely to push the Federal Reserve closer to another increase in short-term interest rates to prevent a surge in inflation -- a move it opted not to take at a policy-setting meeting this week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940709","headline":"Fiscal Board Chief Takes Harvard Post","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/09/nyregion/fiscal-board-chief-takes-harvard-post.html","abstract":"  Allen J.
