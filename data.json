The director and his former lover and co-star will take the stand, their lawyers said, at a Jan. 26 hearing that was ordered yesterday on Mr. Allen's motion for visiting rights while his custody battle with Ms. Farrow continues.   In setting the hearing, Acting Justice Elliott Wilk virtually assured that they would have to submit, publicly and under oath, to questioning both friendly and hostile, far sooner than they otherwise would have. A trial in the case, which is being fought in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is thought to be months away.   When asked outside the courtroom about the prospect that he and Ms. Farrow would have to testify, Mr. Allen, who attended yesterday's session, said, \"I can't wait for that.\" Ms. Farrow was not present.   Ms. Farrow \"would prefer not to have to put the children through it,\" but will take the stand, her lawyer, Eleanor Alter, said.   The feud between Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow exploded into the public eye in August last year, when he sued for sole custody of their three children, claiming Ms. Farrow is an unfit mother.    In turn, she has sued to invalidate Mr. Allen's adoption in December 1991 of 7-year-old Dylan O. Farrow and Moses A. Farrow, 14, whom she had adopted earlier.   She accused him of molesting Dylan at her Connecticut house last summer. He has denied the charge, and countered that Ms. Farrow has brainwashed their three children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930113","headline":"First Student Testifies in Suit To Integrate Hartford Schools","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/13/nyregion/first-student-testifies-in-suit-to-integrate-hartford-schools.html","abstract":"  Milo Sheff, the 13-year-old Hartford student who is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to integrate his city's schools with those in 21 suburbs, testified today in Superior Court.

Yet as counterweights to those transcendent moments, others seemed oddly distant and flat, as if the pianist had spent so much effort conceptualizing the music's structure and contours that he lost sight of its color and depth.   Mr. Black's power of illusion was at its strongest in Poulenc's Nocturnes, eight gracefully descriptive character sketches composed between 1929 and 1938 and not played as frequently as they deserve to be. Mr. Black captured the spirit of each unfailingly and made their extramusical qualities -- a slight impetuousness in the first, mischievousness in the fifth, stateliness in the last -- seem vivid and tangible.

The measured strikes by the U.S., France and Britain at air defense targets in southern Iraq should have been no surprise to anyone, least of all Saddam Hussein.   It would be surprising, however, if the attacks achieved the stated goal of persuading Saddam Hussein to stop attempting to undermine the territorial and military terms imposed by the victors in the Persian Gulf war. For him, the benefits of showing the Arab world he can still thumb his nose at the West outweigh the costs of losing a few radar and missile sites.   Soon -- within a few months, at best -- Mr. Hussein will resume his nibbling. Then the allies, including the new team in Washington, will respond, as they must, with air strikes against targets that he values more. Those responses are unlikely to be decisive, and the round of move and countermove will continue.    Saddam Hussein and the coalition are locked in a ritual dance from which there is no easy exit. The coalition will thus pay a price for failing to press the 1991 war to the point of toppling him. But at that time carrying the ground war into Baghdad's streets seemed likely to cost too many coalition and Iraqi lives and to be unnecessary. Surely, it was assumed, the Iraqi armed forces, with critical help from Washington, would purge the leader who had brought them so catastrophic a defeat. That calculation did not reckon with Mr. Hussein's ability to coerce continued loyalty from an inner circle ruthless enough to suppress opposition.    The means of persuasion at the coalition's disposal today are far fewer than they were two years ago. Renewing the ground war is not among them. Nor need it be: the available instruments are sufficient to get two clear messages across.    The first message is for the Iraqi military establishment. Deprived of modern air defenses, its forces are acutely vulnerable to air attack. It should understand that the strikes will continue, and be more and more costly, until the nibbling stops.    The second message is the same, but it is for the Iraqi people. The coalition will not attack them directly. Nor does it want to attack military targets in their midst. But the Iraqis should realize that the comfortable life they enjoyed before 1990 will be impossible so long as Saddam Hussein continues his provocations. That means maintaining the blockade, at least to the point where only essential medical supplies and foods can enter Iraq. It means continuing the embargo on oil sales and thus denying Iraq the money needed to import anything of value. For middle- and upper-class Iraqis, it means no travel abroad.   Such responses should lead the Iraqi military and people to realize that time is not on Saddam Hussein's side. Obviously, the coalition cannot stop all embargo- and blockade-busting. But sufficient pressure can be maintained for a very long time, particularly if substantial oil sales are prevented.    Iraqis must realize that Mr. Hussein has reduced Iraq to the status of marginal actor in the Middle East; by continuing to exert steady military, political and economic pressure, the coalition can insure that it will remain one. Mr. Hussein's posturing in the prison he has made of his country should not prevent the Clinton Administration and its allies from focusing on the issue that will most affect the Middle East's future stability: the continuing effort to bring about peace between Israel and its neighbors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/nyregion/c-corrections-307493.html","abstract":"  An article on Jan. 2 about race relations in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx misidentified a Hispanic resident whose business is next to others run by blacks and whites.

Neilson, who lost his job as Rangers' head coach 12 days ago, often did things like that. He had a room full of players who believed they should be playing, and he let those who would not learn the news from a lineup posted on the locker room wall -- sometimes after the morning skate on game days. In Richter, he had a goalie who plays brilliantly when confident and erratically when not, and he responded to Richter's on-ice difficulties with confidence-killers. He banished him to the stands in favor of Hirsch (who never played a minute) and failed to talk to him for days.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"Hockey; The Party's Over: One Strong Period and Then Pffffft!","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/sports/hockey-the-party-s-over-one-strong-period-and-then-pffffft.html","abstract":"  It was back to ground zero for the Islanders tonight at Nassau Coliseum as they were shut out, 3-0, by the Washington Capitals, whose veteran goaltender, Don Beaupre, turned impenetrable for the first time since 1991.

The trade deficit, after declining temporarily, is almost at record levels -- nearly $50 billion in 1992. With Japan in the midst of one of its steepest economic declines in years, the chances for a boost in imports of American goods this year are virtually nil. And the Japanese fear a backlash that will lead to unilateral American action to restrict Japanese imports, poisoning early relations with the new Administration.

Mr. Graham, working in conjunction with the set and costume designer John Conklin (also his partner for \"The Ghosts of Versailles\"), has entirely revised the libretto, inserting direct excerpts from \"Much Ado\" in place of Berlioz's own dialogue.

He was primarily a sculptor who strove to connect the academic tradition from which he came with a style that would be distinctly modern. At one point he emulated Rodin, and then he settled on the smooth, attenuated, Mannerist forms for which he became known. He was particularly interested in industrial materials, and he made variations of certain motifs, like the standing female nude, in plaster, bronze and marble, experimenting with various patinas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"Pro Basketball; Time for Basics: Take Ball and Put in Hoop","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/sports/pro-basketball-time-for-basics-take-ball-and-put-in-hoop.html","abstract":"  Since Jan. 1, the Knicks are 2-4, and they have scored more than 100 points just once.

Work it still longer and it will liberate your soul. Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers' go-go grooves are as deep and wide as they come, dressed up in his jazzy guitar and low, growling voice, with the special addition of the P-Funk Horns.

The wars and the world situation are indeed different. But real parallels exist, not between Serbian irregulars and the Vietcong but between the calls of well-intentioned commentators then and now for a \"moderate\" American approach: gradual, limited military involvement.   Three decades ago, the U.S. had to choose among four basic options: noninvolvement; striving for a negotiated settlement; limited intervention, and overwhelming force to guarantee a client's victory. National leaders agreed that we should prevent South Vietnam from falling to the Communists, but not risk war with China or the Soviet Union, so they ruled out the first and last options. Since the second option did not really exist, they ended up walking fatalistically into a quagmire.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930115","headline":"Reviews/Film; Tasteful Cannibalism As Upbeat Viewing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/movies/reviews-film-tasteful-cannibalism-as-upbeat-viewing.html","abstract":"Cannibalism after plane crash.

The prospect has caused some apprehension in Moscow. In the Bush Administration, Russia enjoyed a distinct primacy among other former republics and was treated as the successor to the Soviet Union in arms controls and other areas. It was evidently for this reason that President Boris N. Yeltsin pushed to sign the latest strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start II, while Mr. Bush was still in charge.
