After two of the three acts -- and with only one substantial scene left for Aeneas to sing -- the company announced that the tenor, Paul Frey, had a throat infection and could not continue. Gary Lakes, who sang the role when the production opened last month, took over for Aeneas's farewell.    A singer whose voice is properly supported can sing through a sore throat, and in the dead of winter this is more common than audiences usually know. The problems with Mr. Frey's Aeneas could not all be ascribed to illness. From the start, his sound was powerful enough to cut through Berlioz's hefty orchestration, but he sounded fuzzy, as though he were singing with a mouthful of cotton. Persistent pitch problems and stiff acting also afflicted his reading, but it was undoubtedly the cracked notes in the passionate duet with Dido at the end of the second act that persuaded Mr. Frey to abandon the effort.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"U.S. Will Reassess Support For Haiti's Exiled President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/world/us-will-reassess-support-for-haiti-s-exiled-president.html","abstract":"  President Clinton said today that the United States had decided to reassess its support for the exiled President of Haiti, the Rev.

Yet those troubles still unsettle, as is evident in the Holy See's decision to establish its embassy in Jaffa, which has an Arab identity though it is within Tel Aviv's municipality. Church spokesmen insist that a Franciscan building there was chosen for economic and technical reasons, not to define a political distance between the Vatican and Israel. It is a textbook example of diplomatic euphemism that nobody is expected to believe.    Few issues have caused harder feelings between the Holy See and Israel than the status of Jerusalem. Successive popes have called, before and since Israel's birth in 1948, for territorial internationalization of the Holy City and its sacred shrines. What rankled the founders of the reborn Jewish state was the Vatican's indifference to the political regime in Jerusalem so long as the city was governed by Arabs. Only when Israel initially proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital, and when the Old and New cities were united by Israeli arms in 1967, did the Vatican emphasize the necessity of internationalizing Jerusalem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"National Endowment Cuts Theater Training","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/theater/national-endowment-cuts-theater-training.html","abstract":"  The National Endowment for the Arts, responding to a budget cut by Congress earlier this year, is eliminating its 20-year-old Professional Theater Training Program, which supports 16 of the nation's premier drama schools, including the Juilliard School, the Yale School of Drama and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.

It needs a postwar reconstruction policy just as Russia does, and cannot succeed alone. Foreign policy -- a concept for reliable security -- is as essential a component as it was after World War II.   The cost of the cold war must be included in order to grasp where the U.S. stands in the world and how to proceed. A crucial element in Britain's rapid decline after World War II came from its attitude toward the outcome of the war. The other countries knew they had been defeated, early or late in the conflict, and faced an enormous task of rebuilding and relaunching their societies. Because it was never occupied, Britain believed it had won the right to relax.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"Review/City Ballet; Differing Perspectives on the Spirit of Romance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/arts/review-city-ballet-differing-perspectives-on-the-spirit-of-romance.html","abstract":"  George Balanchine's \"Haieff Divertimento\" and Peter Martins's \"Barber Violin Concerto,\" presented by the New York City Ballet on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater, are essentially examinations of the Romantic spirit.

Looking at the four hands shown in the diagram, with South facing a trump lead in a three-spade contract, would you choose to play or defend?   After the compulsory one no-trump opening, North-South would have done well to defend, collecting 200 or 300 even without a double. But both North-South pairs busily entered the auction. In one case the French partnership bid to two hearts, which just succeeded. In the other, the American North, Paul Soloway, reopened as shown with two clubs. This showed clubs and spades, and prompted his partner, Bob Goldman, to issue a game invitation with a jump to three spades, reaching a precarious contract.   After a trump lead and a low card from the dummy, the European East, Soldano De Falco, had a problem. If he had made the normal play of the nine, South would have won with king, crossed to the club ace and ruffed a club. Then he would have used the heart jack as an entry for another club ruff, and played heart winners to discard diamond losers from the dummy. West would ruff the fourth heart, but the dummy would score two more tricks to give South nine.   De Falco did better by taking the spade ace, cashing two diamond winners to make sure of them, and leading the spade jack. Soloway won with the king, led to the queen and played a fourth round, going down one.   Looking at all four hands, there is a difficult way to succeed in three spades after De Falco's defense. South must assume an even heart break, and start by winning the fourth trick in dummy with the spade queen. He must then enter his hand with a heart lead and ruff a diamond, establishing a diamond winner. Then he can overtake the heart jack and continue hearts. East must ruff sooner or later, and the closed hand has a trump entry, allowing any remaining red-suit winners to be played. East has two trump tricks and two diamond winners but that is all.   So the double-dummy answer is that you should choose to play three spades. But you should not choose to bid it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940108","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/08/nyregion/news-summary-807397.html","abstract":"  International -6  NATO OFFERS POLAND A DEAL  The United States told Poland that NATO was willing to hold joint military exercises on its territory this year.

Its immediate predecessor was \"I Lombardi\" by Verdi, an opera that makes no sense at all but somehow persuades us that it does.   Dvorak's \"Rusalka\" offered an altogether prettier face before Christmas and with it enough dramatic logic and beautiful music to constitute a thriving masterpiece. Yet few companies outside Central Europe put it on with any frequency. It doesn't take much digging to see what's wrong with \"I Lombardi,\" namely a plot in which A leads not to B but instead leaps without explanation to the farthest reaches of the alphabet.

Like the United States, Germany faces a conflict between the pressures of increased global competition and the demands of a citizenry unwilling to leave health and social welfare entirely to the market. This conflict has a special impact on women, and reveals a weakness of the grand free-market future so many Germans envisioned.\n\nBefore the wall fell, East Germany provided extensive public support for parents, especially working mothers. Child care was highly subsidized and widely available. Guaranteed maternity leave amounted to a year off at an average of 80 percent of full pay. The state enforced child support responsibilities by garnishing wages, and provided insurance to fill the gap if an absent parent failed to pay. Women could get abortions at no cost through a national health system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940108","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/08/nyregion/metro-digest-809888.html","abstract":"  CUOMO SEEKING FOURTH TERM   Gov.

Her voice is simply too large and full to suggest anything else.   \"Lush Life\" was one of many pop and jazz standards that Ms. Wynters sang on Tuesday night at Michael's Pub (211 East 55th Street), where she began an open-ended engagement with a trio led by the pianist Herman Foster. Mr. Foster, who seems temperamentally compatible with Ms. Wynters, revels in chunky Erroll Garner-style chords that give a sense of solidity similar to her singing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940108","headline":"Attacked Figure Skater Is Unable to Compete","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/08/sports/attacked-figure-skater-is-unable-to-compete.html","abstract":"  Nancy Kerrigan, a gold-medal favorite for the Olympics, made an emotional withdrawal from the United States figure skating championships today after a knee injury suffered in a clubbing attack on Thursday.
