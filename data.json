The psychiatrists, who are under Federal investigation in connection with one of the largest health-care-fraud cases in American medical history, are also threatening to sue a former patient for what they say was libelous testimony before Congress last summer. The patient, John Deaton, testified that while hospitalized, he was restrained in a body net for 200 days, but that once his insurance was canceled, he was released from the hospital.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950224","headline":"Remembering 5 Little Ones","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/24/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-remembering-5-little-ones.html","abstract":"  Twenty-five years can seem like an inconceivably long time or only yesterday.

He became patriarch and confidant to generations of painters, among them Cezanne, who called him \"le bon Dieu,\" by which he meant a kind of genial god.   It's revealing that Pissarro served this function, as he was, in several senses, an outsider. He was a Jew, and this was during the era of the Dreyfus Affair (a fact not lost on the anti-Semitic Degas, who slighted his former collaborator even while Pissarro continued to champion Degas's art). Pissarro was also born and reared not in France, but on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas. And he was an anarchist.

It seems Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his press secretary, Cristyne Lategano, have been vetting articles to see who has been naughty and who has been nice. Based on their new Giuliani-friendly rating scale, Ms. Lategano will dispense interviews and information to reporters who are sufficiently uncritical. City officials who want to follow American officeholders' two-century tradition of talking to reporters when it will serve the civic interest are being told to clam up.   This, of course, is an approach that will backfire on the Mayor and blight Ms. Lategano's own budding career. But that is their business. The challenge for reporters and editors is to respond professionally to the administration's unprofessional behavior. Mayor Giuliani is not the first politician to try to turn reporters into boosters, simply one of the more clumsy. He is very likely under the sway of some of his more paranoid retainers.

While the retirement age is slowly being increased to 67 and there is talk in Congress of advancing it to 70, the boomers should be very cautious as they approach age 50.

Owners have said players will not be replacements until the regular season begins on April 3, but the union has contended that players will become strikebreakers if they play in spring games.

The solitary sculpture in his show here consists of two chunks of marble. One is a roughly octagonal column of mottled gray-brown stone, toppled on its side and held off the floor by glass marbles scattered beneath it. At one end of the column, the faceting gives way to an oval cylinder. The second piece of marble sits atop the other end: a slab of pink-white stone with semi-circular ridges carved into one side and the other side left unfinished. The words \"Il Giorno mi pesa sulla notte\" (\"The day weighs on me at night\") are inscribed on the edge of the pink slab facing the head of the toppled column.   The piece as a whole is intentionally unprepossessing: neither a traditional composition nor a raw chunk of nature. It can be read as an illustration of the inscription: the horizontal column would be the recumbent artist, and the semi-circles of pink marble would represent the dawn of day, literally weighing on him. But once you start in with the metaphorical readings, it's hard to stop. If you're not careful, the piece as a whole begins to look rather like a large snail: the brown column is its body, and the pink slab is its shell. At this point, the piece begins to look silly. This is presumably not the artist's intention, although with Mr. Fabro, who once exhibited a pair of marble feet emerging from shantung silk trousers, you can never be too sure.

To Congress mavens, who have long loved the boisterous, raucous, backslapping, logrolling politics intrinsic to the legislature, this is a startling development. We are used to malign neglect from the public and the press. Instead, for the first time in modern memory, the First Branch of the American Government is getting the attention, and the respect, that normally has gone to the Presidency.\n\nThe reasons are clear. The most significant was the stunning election in November, bringing the first Republican majority to the House of Representatives in 40 years and the return of a rarely seen Republican majority to the Senate. For the first time in nearly 50 years, we have a Democratic President facing a Republican Congress, rather than the familiar opposite combination. Add the twist of the Contract With America: a revolutionary governing platform with explicit promises for action in the opening 100 days and a blueprint for a fast-paced, efficient policy machine in Congress. Then throw in the electrifying choice of the controversial Newt Gingrich of Georgia as Speaker of the House. The result is a spectacle that has mesmerized not just Washington, but many people living outside the Beltway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Deanna Damiano, Joseph Bastianich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/style/weddings-vows-deanna-damiano-joseph-bastianich.html","abstract":"  When it comes to food, Deanna Damiano, 25, and Joseph Bastianich, 27, are opposites.

The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis's achievements in handling those varied demands have brought him considerable success. Judging from its title, one would expect his book, SWEET SWING BLUES ON THE ROAD (Norton, $29.95), to document how he had managed this mix. At its most engaging, it does just that, offering brief vignettes of the days and nights of a touring band: the humor, the petty annoyances and the satisfaction of making music for (mostly) appreciative audiences. There is also a moving chapterlong homage to respected elder jazzmen. Frank Stewart's elegant photographs offer a nice visual counterpoint to the text. Unfortunately, at some point in his career, Mr. Marsalis took on or had thrust upon him the mantle of Spokesman for the Art of Jazz, a mantle that he now wears quite happily. As a result, too much of the book is taken up with transcripts of classroom sessions in which he restates his views on music and culture and his distaste for rap, rock and MTV. Whether or not one agrees with his assessment of popular culture, he has stated these views forcefully in other, more appropriate venues. Those who agree with Mr. Marsalis will undoubtedly be happy to have their opinions affirmed yet again, but readers looking for a more complete picture of road life will be disappointed.\nGEORGE ROBINSON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"The Controversy Over Plans To Trim the State's Budget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/the-controversy-over-plans-to-trim-the-state-s-budget.html","abstract":"  CLUTCHING their handmade suits and dresses, the old women at the Home for the Aged Blind in Yonkers were both proud and frightened -- proud that they had learned to sew again, although this time it was without their eyes, but worried that they would soon be shut out of the day-care program that taught them their new skills.

Now, guitar straps with her \"Built by Wendy\" label are highly coveted stage ornaments for alternative rockers. Both Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth use them, and Hole's bass player, Melissa Auf der Maur, last year gave them as Christmas gifts to other members of the band.    Ms. Mullin, 24, is from Chicago. She began designing the straps after her roommate brought home a guitar last summer with a strap that Ms. Mullin said was ugly. She copied its basic construction and added scraps of vinyl. Now, she uses a variety of colors like blue, pink and red (and for glam-rockers, gold and silver) and has perfected the material: nylon webbing with vinyl sewn on. Many of the straps have added attractions: small pictures of people like Kate Moss or a series of heavenly cherubs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"In Quebec, Sale Rumors and an Arena Agenda","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/sports/on-pro-hockey-in-quebec-sale-rumors-and-an-arena-agenda.html","abstract":"  The early-season success of the Quebec Nordiques masks the never-ending intrigue in this special hockey city.

No other sport, no other entertainment, indeed no other industry anywhere near the scale of baseball, is exempt from antitrust laws.    The baseball owners themselves have not believed it when it was in their interest. In 1966 the owners invoked the Taft-Hartley Act, which prohibited the payment of money by an employer to an employee's organization, to renege on a $150,000 payment to the fledgling Players Association.

Both the attack and the defense are misguided. Populist conservative critics, in accusing the endowment of \"elitism,\" are echoing a criticism the agency addressed long ago. In 1991, for example, endowment literature pointedly portrayed the agency as nonelitist, boasting that it served 170 ethnic minorities and insured a broad distribution of benefits, taking into account race, ethnicity, sex and geography. Unfortunately, those criteria have little to do with artistic judgment and much to do with social policy. When it comes to art, there is no way of judging even vastly divergent styles without some notion of differentiation and choice -- in other words, elitism.

Today, their songs still matter because they didn't settle for pop illusions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"An Entire Industry Is Unfairly Convicted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/l-an-entire-industry-is-unfairly-convicted-875695.html","abstract":"  In \"Brookhaven Trial Raises Ethical Issues\"  [ Jan. 15 ]  your reporter has tried, convicted and sentenced the entire Long Island real-estate community in his speculative essay that seeks to suggest a regional pattern of corruption following the repudiated testimony of self-admitted swindler John McNamara in Brookhaven Town. While the two elected officials who were tried on McNamara's testimony have been exonerated by a jury, the real-estate industry has no such relief.   It is ironic that your article offers no examples of inferred corruption among the leaders of the real-estate community, but allows others to cynically speculate about \"What ifs\" and \"who knows?\" The article is more a lynching of an entire industry than a factual review of Long Island real-estate practices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Migration Of Blacks Examined","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/nyregion/migration-of-blacks-examined.html","abstract":"AS recently as the 1950's, when Nicholas Lemann was growing up in New Orleans, he said, there was a \"racial classification lady in City Hall,\" whose sole job was to go through birth and death records and determine whether a person's mixed racial ancestry should be categorized as black or white. \n\nMr. Lemann, who is 40 and now lives in Pelham, is a national correspondent for Atlantic Monthly.

One, famously, was Carthage. The other was Corinth, leader of the league of Greek cities that had tried to resist Roman imperial expansion. Under the command of the consul Lucius Mummius, the Romans destroyed Corinth's buildings, killed the men, sold the women and children into slavery, and shipped its art treasures back to Italy. For about a hundred years Corinth lay broken and abandoned.   Finally, in 44 B.C., no longer willing to let the site's strategic position go to waste, the Romans founded a colony there. Although the proletarian colonists did not much appreciate the former greatness of their new home (they did grasp the value of the works of art they scavenged among the ruins and shipped back home), by that time more sensitive Romans were well aware of the barbarity of Mummius's act. One historian, writing in the early first century A.D., offers as proof of the man's boorishness his warning to the transporters of paintings and statues by the greatest artists of the Greek world that they would have to replace anything they broke.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Why Law Is No Fun Anymore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/books/why-law-is-no-fun-anymore.html","abstract":"  OVERCOMING LAW By Richard A.

It was no accident that Tolstoy wrote the opening of \"War and Peace\" in French. After spending a day talking to delegates at the United Nations, I've been thinking that this old romance between Russia and France might have some modern-day applications.    American officials have been grumbling lately about a budding Russo-French alliance. Russia and France have teamed up against the U.S. to push for an early lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq. They have also worked in tandem at times to ease the isolation of Serbia. The Russians have even probed about joining NATO on the same terms as France -- being part of the alliance but not part of its military command. And the Russians have clearly taken to the French national sport of poking a stick in Washington's eye to assert independence.I don't believe there is any real Russo-French strategic alliance; it's more a coincidence of pragmatism. But I do share the view, first articulated by Sovietologist Stephen Sestanovich, that the future of Russian foreign policy is \"Gaullist\" -- that somewhere in the psyche of the Kremlin is a desire to create the sort of relationship with the U.S. that France enjoys. That is, to be seen as broadly part of the Western camp, but still free to define Russia's interests on a range of issues as different from America's -- without creating a crisis in the relationship every time it does.    I think this Russian impulse should be nurtured. The problem with U.S. policy toward Russia today is that in order to persuade Congress to give aid to Moscow, Presidents Bush and Clinton oversold the relationship. Our aid to Russia, they declared, was intended to make Russia just like us.    When Russia does not behave like us, there are two responses. The \"I-love-the-cold-war\" crowd immediately calls for severing aid. Just last week, Newt Gingrich declared that \"we should cut off all aid to Russia\" if it sells nuclear reactors to Iran.    The Clinton Administration responds with the other extreme -- apologizing for Boris Yeltsin, saying in effect: \"Don't pay attention to that man behind the curtain. He's not really drunk. Chechnya was just an aberration, a speed bump on the road to democracy and blah, blah, blah.\" All of which only signals to the Russians that there is little cost to misbehavior.    In other words, right now we have a conceptual approach toward Russia that does not fit the reality of Russia. We keep checking to see if the Russians have become like us, and when we discover they haven't we want to either punish them in ways that only hurt reformers there, or turn a blind eye. It is time we started thinking of Russia as being more like France and less like us -- but only if the Russians are ready to do the same.    You see, the French may disagree with us on issues. They might even kick our spies out of Paris. But it is virtually unimaginable that France would ever take a position that threatened fundamental U.S. national security interests. It is unlikely that Russia today would take such a threatening position -- but not unimaginable.    The reason for that difference is that France is an established democracy and an established state. It knows exactly who it is and where its borders are. The modern Russian state is basically three years old. It is not an established democracy, and it is not certain about its borders or who its citizens are. Russia today is America in 1779. That is 10 years before we agreed on a constitution and 82 years before we had our own civil war.    It would actually be healthy for us to think of Russia the way we think of France. That is, drawing red lines to define fundamental U.S. interests (and I think banning nuclear reactors for Iran is one of those), while learning to raise our eyebrows in other cases and say of the Russians what we say of the French: \"What else do you expect? It's the French.\"    We have to understand the difference between a pain in the neck and a mortal threat. But we will only be able to treat Russia like France after the Russians learn to respect red lines the way the French do. Russia can only be France in our eyes after Russia decides who Russia is.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"Russia, Iran and the Bomb","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/opinion/russia-iran-and-the-bomb.html","abstract":"  The United States, Russia and Iran are tangled in a nuclear thicket that threatens to impede disarming by Moscow while helping Teheran develop atomic weapons.

Russia, desperate for hard currency and trying to keep its nuclear industry alive, wants to sell four nuclear reactors to Iran, which could use them to generate plutonium for bombs. The Clinton Administration is trying diplomatically to get Moscow to cancel the deal outright. Not satisfied with the Administration approach, some in Congress are eager to retaliate by cutting all aid to Russia, including help to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950226","headline":"An Inaugural Ride Can Have Its Bumps","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/style/the-night-an-inaugural-ride-can-have-its-bumps.html","abstract":"  The New York Skyride, on the mezzanine of the Empire State Building, isn't a chairlift to the World Trade towers or a monorail to the theme-park restaurants on 57th Street.
