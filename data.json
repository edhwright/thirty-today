Mr. Brown was on it, face down and fully clothed, atop a woman in a leotard whose high heels waved in the air; then they rolled over so the woman could writhe astride the singer. It was only one of the bump-and-grinds in a quadruple-bill concert devoted to come-ons and boasts of prowess. The aptly titled \"Humpin' Around the World\" tour includes Mr. Brown, the Jamaican dancehall rapper Shabba Ranks, the three-woman pop hip-hop group T.L.C. and the singer Mary J. Blige.   The directness of hip-hop has shaken up the way songs talk about sex. Suave double-entendres are now jostled by single-entendres, and onstage, performers like Mr. Brown act out blunt connotations of lines like \"I will not stop/Till I know you're hot.\" Perhaps in the era of AIDS, freewheeling sex has become one more fantasy to be acted out by pop stars. But before Mr. Brown climbed into his elevator bed, he announced that he was using \"protection.\" Hip-hop has also redrawn old sex roles with new wardrobes but surprisingly little change: men conquer and brag, and women acquiesce while they look for \"real love.\" \"T.L.C. stands up for the ladies,\" a member announced, but then the group sang \"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930202","headline":"United Nations:A Poor Job in Cambodia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/02/opinion/IHT-united-nationsa-poor-job-in-cambodia.html","abstract":"- A precarious peace in Cambodia, maintained by a large-scale international military contingent under United Nations command, appears on the verge of collapse.

The bottom line, though, is that it is virtually impossible to walk away from one of Mr. Goode's recitals without the sense of having gained some new insight, subtle or otherwise, into the works he played or about pianism itself.   Listening to Mr. Goode play the first of two Beethoven-and-Schubert recitals on Sunday evening (the second is on Feb. 14) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one was reminded alternately of Artur Schnabel and Glenn Gould, although his playing really resembles neither. The Gould comparison is in the physicality of Mr. Goode's playing. There is something of a mad puppeteer about him: he sways over the keyboard, mouthing the accents of either melodies or inner lines, occasionally singing audibly, and looking as though he were animating the music by carrying on a dialogue with it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930202","headline":"E.P.A.

His goal is to add much greater flexibility to a health-care system often constrained by Federal regulations.

The world is struggling to complete an epic agreement -- the Uruguay Round of international trade talks -- that could add trillions of dollars to the world's economies through increased trade by the end of the decade. Nothing President Clinton is likely to do to spur economic growth can come close to packing the wallop of a completed trade pact.    Mr. Kantor's foremost responsibility is to resume and complete the Uruguay Round. His next responsibility is to put the finishing touches on the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada. And he needs to fend off protectionist efforts by the automobile, textile, steel and other industries seeking to win in the political marketplace what they could not achieve in the economic marketplace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930202","headline":"CAMBODIA ATTACKS THE KHMER ROUGE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/02/world/cambodia-attacks-the-khmer-rouge.html","abstract":"  The Cambodian Government has mounted its largest military offensive since United Nations peacekeepers arrived here in 1991 and is threatening to overrun a Khmer Rouge rebel stronghold in western Cambodia, United Nations military observers said today.

The structural recession is characterized by a reversal of the usual cause-effect sequence. Layoffs, especially at high wage levels, are its main source rather than its result.   The two recessions interact: a cyclical downswing in 1990, combined with drastic cuts in defense spending and with growing global competition, have acted as catalysts to accelerate the restructurings of the workplace.

It was introduced at the 1990 world championships, and gives a prize for overall performance in a series of minor games at a tournament. This is now being tried in American tournaments, and the Continuous winner at the Tri-State Regional Championship last month was Joan Dziekanski of Manhattan, who works at the Beverly Club.   On the diagramed deal she held the East cards, with her husband, Paul Dziekanski, in the West position. Her opponents bid themselves to one no-trump when outnumbered in high-card points, a risky thing to do when vulnerable.   A heart lead to the ten was won by the queen, and South led the spade nine. West made a good play by putting up the jack, leaving South to wonder about the location of the queen. South might have won with the king, in the hope of scoring five tricks in the suit, but made the right decision by ducking.   West cashed the diamond ace, looking for a clue, and was not sure about the meaning of his partner's four. He tried the club nine, and East took the ace and returned a heart. West took two heart tricks and now worked out that his partner held diamonds. He shifted back to diamonds, and the defense took eight tricks without South's having to judge what to do in spades.   The moral is that light third-hand opening bids are risky when vulnerable. Most experts would choose to open with the North hand, but if they fail to find a spade fit they can expect to suffer the same fate as North-South did: minus 200, the kiss of death in matchpoint play.

Leading Democrats emerged from the one-hour session declaring that for the first time in 12 years they were in accord with a President over the general notion that the amount of money needed to run for office should be reduced and that donations by political action committees should be limited further. President Carter's Mistake    But the participants said they did not discuss specifics, and there was no agreement on issues that were at the heart of promises made by Mr. Clinton during the campaign. One pledge was to limit political action committee contributions to $1,000, instead of the current $5,000 per candidate; another was to provide free or discounted television time for candidates who agree to limit their spending, and a third was to restrict \"soft money\" donations that are intended to skirt Federal spending limits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930204","headline":"Mahoney's Way: 'A Little Bit More'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/04/sports/college-basketball-mahoney-s-way-a-little-bit-more.html","abstract":"  You never plan the victories and the defeats in advance.
