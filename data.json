Those who pay attention will notice that pop critics don't share anything close to the unanimity that movie critics often have in their selections. Among the favorite albums chosen by the four New York Times critics who regularly cover nonclassical music, there is no album comparable to \"Schindler's List\" or \"The Piano\" in popularity. Critical tastes, in fact, seem to diverge more sharply this year than in previous top-10 roundups.    Here are the best albums of the year in the views of Jon Pareles, the chief pop critic; Stephen Holden; Peter Watrous, jazz critic, and Danyel Smith.   \"Exile in Guyville,\" Liz Phair (Matador). Sex and love, betrayal and revenge, hope and resignation from a matter-of-fact songwriter whose guitar riffs are sturdier than her relationships.   \"Adventures in Afropea I,\" Zap Mama (Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers). Women's unaccompanied voices ricochet across rhythms and continents, bouncing from pygmy polyphony to automotive sputters, full of playfulness, intelligence and ingenuity.    \"Siamese Dream,\" Smashing Pumpkins (Virgin). Collegiate rock melts into psychedelia with huge fuzz-toned guitar riffs, meticulous arrangements that surge and drift and stomp, and lyrics that question as much as they proclaim.   \"Reachin' (A Refutation of Time and Space),\" Digable Planets (Pendulum/Elektra). Jazz vamps, rolling along on acoustic bass lines, carry smart, amiable raps from a group that welcomes everyone to the party.   \"In Utero,\" Nirvana (Geffen). Sickened by its own success, Nirvana drops the gloss of its multimillion-selling \"Nevermind\" and reverts to punky rawness, with blasts of guitar, howls of confusion and melody despite it all.    \"Traffic From Paradise,\" Rickie Lee Jones (Warner Brothers). Visions of angels and echoes of Van Morrison's \"Astral Weeks\" on an album so fragile and hopeful that it's completely unfashionable.   \"Star,\" by Belly (Sire). Transparent but steely songs that bend clean-lined folk-rock into elusive parables about female archetypes from daughters and sisters to witches and dolls.   \"Zooropa,\" U2 (Island). U2 confirms its metamorphosis, leaving behind anthem-mongering and shifting toward fractured, ambiguous, eccentrically textured, media-saturated riddles.   \"Janet,\" Janet Jackson (Virgin). A slick big-budget album that surveys dance-floor trends and current pop, held together not by a larger-than-life personality but by its determination to seduce.    \"Live MCMXCIII,\" Velvet Underground (Sire). The short-lived reunion of the definitive New York rockers showed why bands everywhere are still stealing ideas from their lean, unsparing, elemental tales of the urban demimonde.

Upon the death of a slaveholder -- encomendero -- the Indians in his possession would come under the tutelage of the throne, to be given instruction in the Roman Catholic religion as free vassals. The encomenderos bitterly opposed the New Laws, and an attempt was made on Las Casas' life. But even on his deathbed, in 1566, the former Bishop of Chiapas implored friends to protect the Indians.

The two processes actually have a lot in common. Removing the moisture from fruit almost magically changes its nature, concentrating sweetness and adding deep complexities of flavor. It's as if, when the common denominator of water is removed, the core of the fruit's particular character is revealed.\n\nThis culinary metamorphosis has a long history. People in hot, dry climates have been drying fruits for centuries -- from tomatoes laid out on Italian porticos to apricots drying in Iranian courtyards to chilies on tables outside Tunisian restaurants. Until recently, the primary purpose of this exercise was preservation; when deprived of its water, fruit lasts for months, making it an ideal provision for long and difficult journeys.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940105","headline":"Mexican Rebels Are Retreating; Issues Are Not","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/world/mexican-rebels-are-retreating-issues-are-not.html","abstract":"  The peasant guerrilla army that burst into Mexican life with the New Year retreated today from this town and others it had occupied in the southern state of Chiapas as army troops moved in.

His simple, reasonable proposal is to make gun dealers cover the Government's cost of adequate regulation.    Mr. Bentsen wants to charge licensed firearms dealers $600 a year. That is a sizable increase from the roughly $66 charged now, but it is still a fraction of the fees commonly charged for liquor licenses and franchises to sell merchandise that is not dangerous to use or consume. The citizen lobby Handgun Control, while praising the proposal, argues sensibly that still higher fees would be fair to the weapons industry and the public.    The Brady law, which requires a five-day waiting period for the retail sale of handguns, set the current fee of $200 for a three-year license period. For many years the charge was $10 a year, enough to starve the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and force inadequate background and compliance checks. That fee was so low that 284,000 dealers could afford it even if their only purpose in getting the license was to buy their own weapons more cheaply and sell them on black markets.    Firearms officials want to enable their agents to interview licensees, check to see whether they operate a store or trade from their kitchen tables or car trunks, and verify some of the information they gather with local police. A pilot program involving a team of Federal and local officials in New York City recently resulted in the rejection or withdrawal of 216 of 227 Federal license applications.    According to the Treasury Department, a $600 license fee, besides financing a more trustworthy examination, would probably eliminate four-fifths of the licensees, leaving only serious retailers. That's still 57,000 sources of personal weaponry in the United States -- far too many for a nation that is trying to combat gun violence.    Congress should therefore use the Bentsen proposal as a starting point for stronger legislation that exacts even higher fees, driving more marginal dealers out of the market and making sure that those who remain are doing business in legitimate, fixed locations.    Bolder legislation is feasible. Legislators are gradually learning that voting against the wishes of the National Rifle Association is not automatic political death. Witness the hard-won victory for the Brady law. Witness, too, the willingness of the New York State Senate to consider restraints on assault weapons.    When Congress looks at the Bentsen proposal it will see that $600 is a modest fee that would make the firearms industry pay its way only in terms of regulation. The industry doesn't even begin to repay society the cost of the homicides and maimings from too easily obtainable weapons. Congress will need to think more imaginatively about higher fees and stricter standards, using Mr. Bentsen's proposal as the catalyst to develop still other measures that promote domestic safety.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940105","headline":"Donyell Marshall Puts on a Show With 29","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/sports/college-basketball-donyell-marshall-puts-on-a-show-with-29.html","abstract":"  Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said, \"Our all-America played like an all-America tonight.\"   Calhoun was referring to Donyell Marshall, the gem of the 1991 recruiting class.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940105","headline":"Sports of The Times; Shattering Shaquille's Slamfest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/sports/sports-of-the-times-shattering-shaquille-s-slamfest.html","abstract":"  A NEW television commercial for a long-distance telephone service concludes with Shaquille O'Neal's father hanging up the line in a phone booth.

Lendl lost by 6-3, 6-1, to Bernd Karbacher of Germany as the Americans were eliminated from the quarterfinals of the team event. Anke Huber beat Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), in women's singles before Lendl lost. The Americans rebounded to win the mixed doubles by 8-5 in a pro set, but it wasn't enough to stave off elimination. Lendl, who is ranked 19th in the world to Karbacher's 54th, succeeded with less than a third of his first serves and his ground strokes lacked timing. In desperation, Lendl tried to serve-and-volley, but even that tactic failed.  (AP) N.H.L.

After two of the three acts -- and with only one substantial scene left for Aeneas to sing -- the company announced that the tenor, Paul Frey, had a throat infection and could not continue. Gary Lakes, who sang the role when the production opened last month, took over for Aeneas's farewell.    A singer whose voice is properly supported can sing through a sore throat, and in the dead of winter this is more common than audiences usually know. The problems with Mr. Frey's Aeneas could not all be ascribed to illness. From the start, his sound was powerful enough to cut through Berlioz's hefty orchestration, but he sounded fuzzy, as though he were singing with a mouthful of cotton. Persistent pitch problems and stiff acting also afflicted his reading, but it was undoubtedly the cracked notes in the passionate duet with Dido at the end of the second act that persuaded Mr. Frey to abandon the effort.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"U.S. Will Reassess Support For Haiti's Exiled President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/world/us-will-reassess-support-for-haiti-s-exiled-president.html","abstract":"  President Clinton said today that the United States had decided to reassess its support for the exiled President of Haiti, the Rev.

Yet those troubles still unsettle, as is evident in the Holy See's decision to establish its embassy in Jaffa, which has an Arab identity though it is within Tel Aviv's municipality. Church spokesmen insist that a Franciscan building there was chosen for economic and technical reasons, not to define a political distance between the Vatican and Israel. It is a textbook example of diplomatic euphemism that nobody is expected to believe.    Few issues have caused harder feelings between the Holy See and Israel than the status of Jerusalem. Successive popes have called, before and since Israel's birth in 1948, for territorial internationalization of the Holy City and its sacred shrines. What rankled the founders of the reborn Jewish state was the Vatican's indifference to the political regime in Jerusalem so long as the city was governed by Arabs. Only when Israel initially proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital, and when the Old and New cities were united by Israeli arms in 1967, did the Vatican emphasize the necessity of internationalizing Jerusalem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"National Endowment Cuts Theater Training","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/theater/national-endowment-cuts-theater-training.html","abstract":"  The National Endowment for the Arts, responding to a budget cut by Congress earlier this year, is eliminating its 20-year-old Professional Theater Training Program, which supports 16 of the nation's premier drama schools, including the Juilliard School, the Yale School of Drama and the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.

But those were the visible qualities of the Prussian capital from 1815 to 1848, in good part thanks to an architect of genius named Karl Friedrich Schinkel. This lost Berlin was overwhelmed by an imperial building boom and then battered by World War II air raids that leveled a third of the city.    Schinkel's Berlin is recalled to life in an exhibition at 18 West 86th street, the new Manhattan home of Bard College's Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts. His Berlin and Potsdam, here portrayed on porcelain vases, are romantic visions, with villas and palaces set in verdant parks shaped by a gifted landscape designer, Peter Joseph Lenne.

Mario M. Cuomo proposed today an array of incentives to encourage job growth, including cutting taxes on real-estate developers, corporations and hotels.   In his 12th State of the State Message, Mr. Cuomo made three long-standing Republican themes -- improving the state's business climate, fighting crime and reforming welfare -- the centerpieces of his legislative blueprint for 1994, a year in which he and all 211 members of the state Legislature are up for re-election. Mr. Cuomo has said he will announce by the end of the week whether he will seek a fourth term, and he used his speech today to systematically shore up each of his most distinct political vulnerabilities.

Usually the music was rock-and-roll; at least, the rock bands got most of the attention. But there was another kind of band scene coalescing at the time. Composers whose tastes had led them away from both atonality and neo-Romanticism were putting together bands of like-minded players to explore the experimental visions that led to Minimalism and to the many hybrids of rock, jazz and concert music that flourish in the Downtown new-music world today.   At first, these bands were matters of practical and economic necessity. They were laboratories for composers, who knew the capabilities of their players and often stretched them, and who were guaranteed performances that were entirely under their control. And composers discovered that they could often earn larger fees as players -- particularly as the sole performers of their own music -- than through the more traditional route of publishing works for other musicians to play.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940106","headline":"Trooper's 2d Tampering Charge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/06/nyregion/trooper-s-2d-tampering-charge.html","abstract":"  A New York State Police investigator who was charged last month with evidence tampering was arrested again yesterday on similar charges in a separate case.

It now emerges that by so refusing, she has bought time for Justice Department and White House lawyers to cook up a deal to keep the Whitewater records under wraps. Moreover, those records are being handled so sloppily that when an independent counsel is finally -- and inevitably -- appointed, that official will have to spend vast energy to be sure no evidence has been destroyed.   Is no one at the White House reading the history of recent Presidential scandals? These clumsy efforts at suppression are feckless and self-defeating.
