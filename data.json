Once an honor student with dreams of mainstream success, Mr. Snipes's character sees the heroin overdose of his mother and the complicity of his father in drug trafficking as sealing his fate. Much of the film's power lies in the way the film makers, through Mr. Snipes's psyche, contrast Harlem's revered past before heroin with its misdirected and stifled potential.\n\nMuch like the city that surrounds it, Harlem is haunted by its past. Whether that past is as gloriously upbeat as those with selective memories like to remember is, at least to me, as debatable as whether the present is as unalterably gloomy as conventional wisdom believes. If you view Harlem's past as a landscape strode only by giants named Ellington, Hughes and Powell, it's hard, even foolish, to seek contemporary parallels.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Not the Center Of the Universe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/arts/l-jazz-at-lincoln-center-not-the-center-of-the-universe-066451.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Tom Piazza's essay \"Lincoln Center and Its Critics Swing Away\"  [ Jan. 16 ]  makes a worthwhile esthetic point about the vital tension between individual expression and collective context in jazz.

We wanted to edge near enough to glaciers to see and hear the icebergs break off, or calve; hug the shoreline tightly enough to watch the sea lions loaf and the bears forage; sail straight into the Sound where Alaska's humpback whales spend their summers. The fact that our nine-year-old ship was retrofitted to resemble a Klondike steamer, complete with ornate plaster ceilings, sculptured mahogany bar and chandeliers worthy of the Gilded Age, was simply a matter of interest. We didn't object to the theme; we just hoped they wouldn't play it to death.   In the event, the ship's turn-of-the-century fittings proved to be attractive and comfortable, and evocations of the Klondike era at get-acquainted and end-of-cruise parties added spark to the informal voyage.

A corrected version follows. Sweet-and-Sour Pot Roast Total time: 2 hours plus marinating  3 pounds boneless rump roast or top round in one piece  1 cup dry white wine  1/3 cup cider vinegar  1 tablespoon cooking oil  2 cups chopped onions  1 cup chopped carrots  3 cloves minced garlic  1/2 cup raisins  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  1/2 teaspoon ground allspice  3 tablespoons light brown sugar  1 cup beef or veal stock  1/2 cup crushed canned tomatoes  2 bay leaves, crushed  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste.   1. Place the meat in a deep bowl, add the white wine and vinegar and allow to marinate six to eight hours.    2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    3. Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and pat the beef dry. Heat the oil in a heavy three-quart casserole. Add the beef and brown it on all sides. Remove the meat from the casserole and add the onions and carrots and cook over medium-low heat until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, then add the raisins, ginger, allspice and brown sugar. Add the stock, the reserved marinade and the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to casserole.   4. Cover the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for about two hours, until the meat is tender.    5. To serve, remove the meat from the casserole and slice it. Arrange on a platter. Reheat the sauce and check seasoninings. Add some or all the lemon juice if the sauce does not seem tart enough. Spoon some of the hot sauce over the meat and pass the rest.    6. Alternatively, the meat can be refrigerated overnight in the cooking liquid and the next day the meat can be sliced and the sauce reheated before serving. This will improve the meat's flavor and texture and allow the layer of chilled fat on liquid's surface to be removed and discarded.   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Sunscreen May Be Skin Cancer Villain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/opinion/l-sunscreen-may-be-skin-cancer-villain-102415.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Thank you for \"Mouse Study Raises Doubts About Sunscreens\" (Science Times, Jan. 25).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Manufacturers Oppose Clinton Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/us/manufacturers-oppose-clinton-plan.html","abstract":"  Arguing that the White House had ignored their pleas to amend President Clinton's health care proposals, the directors of the National Association of Manufacturers voted 56 to 20 today not to support the Administration's package \"in its present form.\"   The resolution was the third blow this week to the Clinton plan from a major business organization, and perhaps the most damaging.

In every event, the 15 highest-ranked skiers are seeded and allowed to ski first, which is usually when course conditions are optimal. If conditions are extremely poor, a few luckless, low-ranked skiers are occasionally sent out to ski before the seeded skiers in order to pack down the trail. In a race made up of two runs, the top 15 finishers after the first run reverse order for the second run. THE SETUP: Slalom (a Norwegian word) and giant slalom, both contested over two runs, are known as \"technical\" events because they require skiers to negotiate their way through red- and blue-flagged double poles known as \"gates\" by making dozens of quick, tight turns. A slalom course must have a minimum of 55 gates for men and 45 for women. A giant slalom course is longer, faster and more open, with a minimum distance between gates of about 13 feet as opposed to about two and a half feet in slalom. Each run of a slalom and giant slalom is held on a different course.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/nyregion/c-corrections-100986.html","abstract":"  An answer in the Q & A column on page 32 of the Travel section today about renting apartments in Paris misstates the telephone number for France U.S.A.

THE SETUP: In moguls, skiers race a qualifying and final run down a steep course about two football fields long, cluttered with moguls, or snow bumps, while incorporating two upright jumps. In aerials, the skiers jump off a chute to perform their two jumps (like in skateboarding), and are judged for takeoff, height and distance (called the air of a jump), execution and landing, among other criteria. THE SCORING: For moguls, think figure skating with a clock, complete with music and scoring on a scale of 0 to 7.5 points. Judges decide how well a skier tackles the moguls (50 percent of his score) and the air of the jump (25 percent) and then his total time (another 25 percent). In aerials, the judges, score on air (20 percent), execution and precision (50 percent) and landing (30 percent. THE STRATEGY: In moguls, it's watch out for the bumps while maintaining jumping style; in aerials, acrobatics rule, with somersaults and twists leading the way. THE NAMES: Recovered from major surgery on her right knee, Donna Weinbrecht of West Milford, N.J., is favored to defend her 1992 gold medal in moguls. Her top challenge should come from Stine Lise Hattestad, the 1993 world champion from Norway.

Remove the meat from the casserole and add the onions and carrots and cook over medium-low heat until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, then add the raisins, ginger, allspice and brown sugar. Add the stock, the reserved marinade and the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to casserole.   4. Cover the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for about two hours, until the meat is tender.    5. To serve, remove the meat from the casserole and slice it. Arrange on a platter. Reheat the sauce and check seasoninings. Add some or all the lemon juice if the sauce does not seem tart enough. Spoon some of the hot sauce over the meat and pass the rest.    6. Alternatively, the meat can be refrigerated overnight in the cooking liquid and the next day the meat can be sliced and the sauce reheated before serving. This will improve the meat's flavor and texture and allow the layer of chilled fat on liquid's surface to be removed and discarded.   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"A Director Focuses on Children and Incest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/movies/film-a-director-focuses-on-children-and-incest.html","abstract":"  The British film maker Andrew Birkin insists that his new movie, \"The Cement Garden,\" is not necessarily about incest.

If the Bo-Dyn sleds, which are much quieter than the European versions and are generally considered easier to drive, turn out to be a big answer to ending the American medal drought, it will be no small coincidence that it was the stock-car branch of American motorsport that produced the sled.    For one thing, stock-car racing, of all forms of motorsports, operates under the strictest technological limits, to control costs and keep the richer teams from buying their way into the winner's circle.

Whatever their origin, few would dispute the beauty of this balmy archipelago, where misty peaks loom over whitewashed villages and, in the summer months, hydrangea hedges wind like lavender ribbons across verdant hillsides. Temperatures in the Azores average 55 degrees in winter and 74 in summer, ideal for plants and people. Wild ginger, yellow cannas, miniature roses, pink azaleas and heathergrow riotously along the roadsides. With an uncharacteristic thrift of words, William F. Buckley Jr. wrote in his book \"Atlantic High\" that the Azores \"are, quite simply stated, the most beautiful group of islands in the world.\" Yet tourism has remained modest in the Azores: about 122,000 people visited the Azores from January through October 1993, down from 145,000 for the corresponding period the year before.  After a five-hour direct flight from Boston, we touched down in late July on the largest of the Azores: Sao Miguel, reminiscent of New Zealand, Hawaii, even Ireland. \n\nIn Ponta Delgada, the capital of Sao Miguel and administrative center of the Azores, the formidable 16th-century Forte de Sao Bras, guards the harbor entrance. A promenade paved with black and white stones graces the city's waterfront where tourists and local people dip in the immense swimming pool overlooking the harbor. Pedestrian street malls, colorful flower boxes and the numerous Baroque church bell towers hewn from black basalt maintain the old-world character of this city of about 100,000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/residential-resales-067903.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

He stares out from the pages of MILES DAVIS: The Man in the Green Shirt (Holt, $40) with an intensity that is almost tangible. Even as a very young man in a very conventional mid-40's publicity shot, he has fire in his eyes; even as a ravaged-looking sexagenarian, his eyes hidden behind huge sunglasses, he holds himself like a man born for the spotlight. As a visual record of a remarkable career, this book is exemplary. Unfortunately, the photographs accompany a text by Richard Williams that is by turns pedestrian and bizarre (and marred by the occasional factual error). Mr. Williams, a veteran English music journalist who now writes about sports for The Independent, does a workmanlike job of rehashing the salient facts of Davis's life. When he attempts to provide a fresh perspective on the great trumpeter's music and mystique, however, the results can be downright silly. The book's title, for example, is a reference to what Davis wore in the striking photograph that graced the cover of his 1958 album \"Milestones.\" Mr. Williams lucidly explains why this recording was one of the most significant of Davis's career, but wildly overreaches himself by attempting to make the curious case that the picture and the shirt were as significant as the music. For all his heavy breathing, he fails to demonstrate that Miles Davis's green shirt was anything more or less than a nice-looking shirt. Similarly, \"Miles Davis: The Man in the Green Shirt\" is ultimately no more or less than a nice-looking coffeetable book about a brilliant musician.

Sweet-and-Sour Pot Roast Total time: 2 hours plus marinating  3 pounds boneless rump roast or top round in one piece  1 cup dry white wine  1/3 cup cider vinegar  1 tablespoon cooking oil  2 cups chopped onions  1 cup chopped carrots  3 cloves minced garlic  1/2 cup raisins  1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  1/2 teaspoon ground allspice  3 tablespoons light brown sugar  1 cup beef or veal stock  1/2 cup crushed canned tomatoes  2 bay leaves, crushed  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or to taste.   1. Place the meat in a deep bowl, add the white wine and vinegar and allow to marinate six to eight hours.    2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    3. Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and pat the beef dry. Heat the oil in a heavy three-quart casserole. Add the beef and brown it on all sides. Remove the meat from the casserole and add the onions and carrots and cook over medium-low heat until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, then add the raisins, ginger, allspice and brown sugar. Add the stock, the reserved marinade and the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to casserole.   4. Cover the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for about two hours, until the meat is tender.    5. To serve, remove the meat from the casserole and slice it. Arrange on a platter. Reheat the sauce and check seasoninings. Add some or all the lemon juice if the sauce does not seem tart enough. Spoon some of the hot sauce over the meat and pass the rest.    6. Alternatively, the meat can be refrigerated overnight in the cooking liquid and the next day the meat can be sliced and the sauce reheated before serving. This will improve the meat's flavor and texture and allow the layer of chilled fat on liquid's surface to be removed and discarded.   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"The Pros and Cons of Antilock Brakes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/sports/about-cars-the-pros-and-cons-of-antilock-brakes.html","abstract":"  A LOT of snow.

He had just completed a nearly flawless performance in the technical program at the European championships, and his compact frame was quivering with emotion.   This was no exhibition, no routine evening's work in yet another North American arena with only the applause meter as his judge and jury.   This was genuine competition, exactly the kind of forum he had been craving when he sat down with his American agent, Michael Rosenberg, last spring and laid out his plans to regain eligibility for the 1994 Olympics.   While the voluble Rosenberg railed on about the \"high six-figure\" earnings Petrenko would be kissing goodbye during the coming professional season and the damage an Olympic flop could inflict on his future drawing power, the Ukrainian with the Las Vegas, Nev., address calmly turned, and according to Rosenberg, said: \"Michael, I am an athlete. The Olympics says I can come back, so I must go back.\"   End of conversation. End of high six-figure earnings, at least temporarily. 'Nothing to Lose'    \"I have nothing to lose,\" said Petrenko, who turned 24 in June. \"Skating is what I live for.\"   Skating has certainly shaped his life. Born in the Black Sea port city of Odessa in what was then the Soviet Union, Petrenko began working with the coach Galina Zmievskaya at the age of 10. He has never had another teacher, and in the summer of 1992, several months after he won the gold medal in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, their long association took on an added dimension when Petrenko married Zmievskaya's daughter, Nina, in Odessa.   The newlyweds soon set up house in Las Vegas, a city where ice is usually restricted to cocktail glasses. Petrenko picked it as his professional training base because one of his friends was the director of skating at the Santa Fe Ice Rink, which lies in the Nevada desert about 10 miles away from the myriad, man-made distractions of \"The Strip.\"   \"I see a lot of casinos, but I don't play; I don't like to gamble,\" said Petrenko, who owns a comfortable townhouse near the Sante Fe rink in a fenced-in development (Rosenberg prefers the term \"gated community.\")   After headlining a 72-city ice show tour and participating in the 59-city Tom Collins tour, Petrenko flew back to Odessa with Nina in June last year to begin preparations for his third Olympics. Once again, he will be marching behind a different flag in the opening ceremony. Won Bronze in Calgary    In 1988, Petrenko won bronze for the Soviet Union in Calgary, finishing behind Brian Boitano and Brian Orser. In 1992, he won gold while representing the euphemistically titled Unified team. This year, he will be skating for Ukraine.   \"It will be a great chance to skate for a new country; it makes me more happy,\" he said.   Petrenko would be happier still if his surrogate sister-in-law, Oksana Baiul, could soar to a gold medal of her own. Baiul, who won the world championship last year at age 15, was taken in by Zmievskaya in 1992 after losing her mother, Marina, to cancer and her coach, Stanislav Koritek, to a secure job in Canada. (Baiul's father, who is still alive, left the family when she was an infant.)   Petrenko has been supportive of Baiul from the start, supplying her with equipment and financial assistance. The two skaters have developed a close relationship, training together with Zmievskaya for the last five months on the soft, unpredictable ice of the Odessa Sports Palace.   Though some could question Petrenko's decision to train in such conditions (he recently felt obliged to purchase a skate-sharpening machine for the rink), he claims to have never hesitated. \"My family is in Odessa, and all my friends; it's home,\" he said. No Illusions    But Petrenko harbors no illusions about the role of figure skating in a nation where people remain concerned with finding and affording their daily bread.   \"There are no popular athletes in Ukraine,\" he said. \"People are more interested in political situations. Yeltsin and Kravchuk are more popular than athletes. People are too busy thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow.\" He was referring to the Russian president, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Ukrainian president, Leonid Kravchuk.   Perhaps. But when a Russian television broadcaster erroneously reported last month that Petrenko was in danger of not qualifying for the final round of the European men's competition (he ended up winning), hundreds of Ukrainians were interested enough to call the federation and express their shock and dismay.   \"Our director was pretty busy for a day,\" said Vladimir Geraschenko, a spokesman for the figure-skating federation.   Whether Petrenko can bring a psychological lift to his troubled homeland depends a great deal on his ability to skate cleanly. In all his years as a world-class competitor, he has always stumbled in either his original or free program in the big events. In Albertville, he fell on a triple axel in his long program but still won because nobody else kept their feet either.   This time, the competition will be considerably stiffer with Boitano, a healthy Kurt Browning and two emerging talents in Scott Davis and Elvis Stojko.   \"Most of all, I want to be in the Olympics and do a good job of showing my programs,\" Petrenko said. \"What place I get doesn't matter.\"   It might matter to his earning power, but even Rosenberg, the man who monitors the cash flow, has learned to live with that risk.   \"Viktor always laughs with me that he is going to do three more Olympics,\" Rosenberg said. \"I tell him I'll catch up with him when he's 40.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Where a Star Is Born, And Then Ignored","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/sports/the-home-team-where-a-star-is-born-and-then-ignored.html","abstract":"  \"Oy, oy, oy,\" the tour guide said with a heavy sigh.

There has been no admission of guilt; whether the settlement is hush money or an expensive way to avoid unscripted courtroom appearances is open to speculation.    Still, Jackson's public image has, perhaps irrevocably, been shifted from the pre-pubescent Peter Pan figure of Neverland Ranch to something far less innocent.

But it is already beginning to take shape in a studio on the Upper West Side.  WHO?: A Portuguese princess, Catherine became Queen of England in 1662 by marrying Charles II. Through trade with Portugal, she is said to have helped introduce tea to England. And because her dowry included Bombay, England gained entry to India. WHY QUEENS?: During the reign of Charles and Catherine, New York City passed from the Dutch to the English, back to the Dutch, then finally to England again. Kings County (Brooklyn) was named for Charles, and Queens County for Catherine. SIZE: The statue will be about 36 feet tall on a 50-foot-high base. HOW FAR ALONG IS IT?: The project started with a 26-inch clay statuette with succeeding models that size in plaster, wax and then bronze. Enlarged by the sculptor in stages for adjustments in its proportions, the statue is now in its second size, four feet tall. The next incarnation will be at 10 feet tall, followed by full height. SYMBOLISM: Catherine stands atop a large globe and holds a smaller one in her left hand, which convey her role in bridging the old and new worlds and also represent the diversity of Queens today. THE BOTTOM LINE: $1 million; cost of base unknown. WHO'S PAYING?: The Government of Portugal donated $270,000, and $730,000 more is to be raised there. American donors will be asked to pay for the base. FACING: Undecided. The artist wants a rotating base to give Catherine a one-quarter turn with each season. SPONSOR: Friends of Queen Catherine, a nonprofit organization promoting her contributions and Portuguese-American ties. UNVEILING: Planned for 1998, the 100th anniversary of the consolidation of Queens into New York City.

STRATEGIES FOR ARTISTS    Strategies for performing, visual and literary artists to market their talents effectively will be offered in a two-part workshop that will be held from 7:30 to 10 P.M. tomorrow and Tuesday in Montclair.   Intended for artists at all experience levels, the workshop, \"The Artist as Entrepreneur: How to Promote Yourself as an Artist in Business,\" will be co-sponsored by the Montclair Arts and Cultural Alliance and the Montclair Art Museum.   Publicity, advertising, networking, finding market niches and creating a professional presentation will be among the topics covered. The workshop will be led by Marcia Mungenast, a communications consultant and writer who was formerly a dancer, choreographer and teacher.    Eleven arts professionals who have developed successful careers for themselves and or others will be featured in a panel discussion on Tuesday. They will answer questions and provide advice in specific fields.   The panelists will include Celia Collins, who operates a one-person puppet theater; Nancy Hutchinson, whose first novel will be published in June by HarperCollins; Diane Israel, who owns an art gallery; Peter Jacobs, who specializes in photographing fine art; Mary McTigue, an actress who wrote a book on professionalism in the theater; Ron Owens, president of Audience Pleasers, a talent agency and production company; Sharon Stephens, executive director of Nicholas Rodriguez and Dance Compass, and several artists from the field of music.   The sessions will be held at the museum at the corner of South Mountain and Bloomfield Avenues. Registration is $25, or $20 for students.   Information: (201) 744-1717. 'FROM THE INSIDE OUT'    Among the musical artists participating in the workshop at the museum will be Peggy Schecter, co-artistic director of the New Jersey Chamber Music Society, who will be busy on Friday playing the flute for one of the innovative programs that enhance the ensemble's reputation.    The event will be the third annual \"From the Inside Out,\" informal family programs in which Robert Kapilow gives the audience a participatory appreciation of classical music by focusing on a composition as it was written, in segments and sometimes rewriting segments in the style of a lesser composer to demonstrate the choices that distinguish genius.    Mr. Kapilow, a composer and the host of \"What Makes It Great?\" on National Public Radio, will deal with the subject \"Bach's 'Brandenburg Concerto No. 2:' Who Owns It?\" at 8:30 P.M. in the Union Congregational Church, 176 Cooper Avenue in Upper Montclair.    Ms. Schecter and other members of the society with the Essex Quartet as guest artists will musically illustrate Mr. Kapilow's presentation and perform the entire concerto. Tickets are $18, or $6 for students.    Information: (201) 746-6068. MARY L. EMBLEN GROWTH OF A THEATER    After opening as a vaudeville house in 1927, the Ritz Theater in Oaklyn switched to popular Hollywood movies in the 1940's. Foreign films were on in the 50's and 60's, X-rated films in the 70's.    Envisioning something live and legitimate at the Ritz, Bruce A. Curless leased the playhouse in 1986 and scheduled a season of theater. It attracted 701 subscribers. Last season's figure, 3,582, has been surpassed this season, said Nancy Seavy, the theater's public relations representative.    Subscriptions are still coming in, she said, for the current year, which began on Jan. 7 with \"On the 20th Century,\" the flamboyant, stylish 1978 Broadway adaptation of the celebrated 1930's play and film.   With unorthodox Cy Coleman music, Art Deco designs that duplicate the luxury chromium-plated train of legend and performing requirements ranging from showy tap to high tessitura, this is the Ritz's most venturesome show yet.    \"We couldn't have done it eight years ago,\" Mrs. Seavy said. \"For this show, we can't have actors who can't sing, or singers who can't act. But now we're attracting talent that can handle it. And we've grown into a significant theater -- the only one known for big-time musicals in southern New Jersey.\"    Not that the Ritz puts on musicals only. \"Lend Me a Tenor\" will follow \"20th Century,\" which plays today at 2 P.M. and Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. Tickets are $10 for the matinee and $12 for evenings.    \"Private Collection,\" a new series, is being added this season. It willconsist of \"Sweet Sue,\" by A. R. Gurney, from Feb. 18 to Feb. 20; a Shakespeare sampler, from April 8 to April 12, and a monthlong festival of music and dance programs, children's productions and one-act plays in June.

Bonnie Blair and Alberto Tomba are back hoping to win their fourth and fifth gold medals; Dan Jansen is back, too, still hoping to win his first.

From experiments in the new to explorations of the past, the how seems to take precedence over the what these days. The way we do things, in other words, overshadows the spirit in which we do them. Just as the avant-garde busies itself with the machinery and electrical circuitry of music-making, so proponents of period instruments and usage have made historically accurate methodology the groundwork for a new musical morality.   Mr. Schiff, a pianist, is asking for trouble, for he is performing Bach on an instrument that in the composer's time existed only as the crudest of prototypes. Early pianos, with their nascent ability to respond to the performer's touch in a forceful way, impressed Bach not at all. Bach's public keyboard instrument other than the organ was the harpsichord. For private entertainment he chose the faint-sounding and ever sensitive clavichord.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940206","headline":"Signs Signal Both Profit and Controversy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/realestate/signs-signal-both-profit-and-controversy.html","abstract":"  THE best-known 7,200 square feet along the East River in Hunters Point, Queens, have been under reconstruction recently in a factory on 12th Avenue in Manhattan, not far from the Hudson River.

Louisville is 18-2 over all, and Vanderbilt dropped to 10-8. (AP) Kansas 94, Nebraska 87: In Lawrence, Kan., Steve Woodberry made a 3-pointer and then slammed home the first dunk of his career in the final two minutes as No. 3 Kansas (20-3, 5-2 Big Eight) turned back Nebraska (12-6, 2-4) to hand the Cornhuskers their fourth straight loss. The Jayhawks are the first Division I team to win 20 games this season.

Norman, who said he incurred a lung infection while playing in the Dubai Classic last month, finished with a four-under-par 68 yesterday for a 277 total on the 7,049-yard, par-72 Blue Canyon Country Club course. \"Beware of a sick golfer,\" Norman said.

Bobby Hebert, a late replacement for the injured Troy Aikman in the Pro Bowl, engineered a pair of second-half scoring drives yesterday to lift the National Conference to a 17-3 victory over the American Conference in Honolulu. The Atlanta Falcons' quarterback completed 4 of 6 passes for 68 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter of the Minnesota Vikings 1:19 into the final quarter. Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason, operating in a no-huddle offense, guided the A.F.C. to the field goal by Pittsburgh's Gary Anderson. Tight end Brent Jones of the San Francisco 49ers broke his right ankle in the first half. He will be able to begin working out again in six to eight weeks, which means he should be ready far in advance of training camp.

The 18-year-old senior from St. Vincent's in the Windward Islands group won the 55-meter dash in 6.2 seconds, tying the P.S.A.L. indoor record, and the 300 meters in 34.6 seconds, 11th best on the career New York State list. Boys and Girls captured the Brooklyn team title with Rohan Hepburn leading the Kangaroos with firsts in the 1,000 (2 minutes, 32.2 seconds, second fastest in the United States this year) and 1,600 (4:28.8). In the Bronx P.S.A.L. meet at the same site, Rob Overby won two events, the 55 meters (6.3 seconds) and 300 (36.6 seconds), to pace DeWitt Clinton to the team title.    Seton Hall Wins Team Title: Flirtisha Harris led Seton Hall to its fourth consecutive team title in the Metropolitan Intercollegiate women's championship at Seton Hall's field house yesterday. St. John's was a close second, scoring 22 points in the final event, the heptathlon, to finish with 136 points to Seton Hall's 141, and Manhattan was third with 128. Harris, a Seton Hall senior, won the 55-meter dash in 6.94 seconds 0.01 off her meet record, lowered her own meet record in the 200 meters to 24.04 seconds and anchored the Lady Pirates' 4x400-meter team to victory with a 54.6 carry.   Senn and Wells Win Titles: Carol Senn won the women's title and John Wells the men's crown yesterday in the Metropolitan Athletics Congress-Chemical Bank pentathlon championships at Fordham University.

The winner in the 24-hour race at Daytona International Speedway was a Nissan ZX300, co-driven by Paul Gentilozzi, Scott Pruett, Butch Leitzinger and New Zealander Steve Millen. (AP) TENNIS  Graf Routs Navratilova  A week after winning the Australian Open, Steffi Graf overwhelmed Martina Navratilova, 6-2, 6-4, yesterday in the championship of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. Graf, 24, made 82 percent of her first serves at speeds of up to 104 miles an hour. Navratilova, 37, made only 66 percent.

A soundtrack of subway sounds and the playwright's evocative videography in which the New York cityscape flashes by outside the car windows lend the production a rich urban atmosphere. So do the performances by a dozen actors playing a cross section of New York riders who enter and leave the car at regular stops.    In the opening scene the central character, Joshua Hudson (Jesse N. Holmes), banters with the audience, shows off his Bill Blass suit and tells bad jokes about John and Lorena Bobbitt. Next he presents a witty fantasy of subway euphoria in which a bunch of normally grim commuters burst out of their defensive shells and become hysterically convivial.

How sweet that old chestnut is, equally comforting to the unbeautiful, who know they have so much beyond physical appearance to offer the world, and the beautiful, who, after years of being pursued for their prettiness, really do want to be loved for their inner selves.    The only problem with the cliche, say evolutionary biologists, is that it may not be true. In the view of a growing number of researchers who study why animals are attracted to each other, a beautiful face and figure may be alluring not for whimsical esthetic reasons, but because outward beauty is a reasonably reliable indicator of underlying quality. These biologists have gathered evidence from studies of species as diverse as zebra finches, scorpion flies, elk and human beings that creatures appraise the overall worthiness of a potential mate by looking for at least one classic benchmark of beauty: symmetry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"Sunken Soviet Sub Leaks Radioactivity in Atlantic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/world/sunken-soviet-sub-leaks-radioactivity-in-atlantic.html","abstract":"  Russian scientists have told American experts that a Soviet submarine that sank seven years ago 500 miles east of Bermuda is broken up and leaking radioactivity from her nuclear equipment into an area of strong currents, raising the threat of environmental poisoning.

The last piece played, \"La Noche de los Mayas,\" was theoretically this festival's starting point.

Its cuts and additions -- a billion here, a few hundred million there -- are dwarfed by the total spending proposal of $1.5 trillion. But the tinkering does follow themes, and some areas will fare better, or worse, than others. Here are some examples. Dollar figures show what the Administration seeks from Congress for each program, not what may be spent in the 1995 fiscal year. WINNERS Technology Just about any program whose title boasts the words \"computer\" or \"research\" gains money. Some big winners: the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, once known only for winding the national clock but now a grantor for private research; information \"superhighway\" research. Still, the total Federal research and development budget, up 4 per cent to $72 billion for 1995, only slightly beats inflation.                 Program   1994 spending   1995 spending   Increase or          in millions   in mill-prop.   decrease-per.

Chapter I programs       for low-income schools   $6,912   $7,579   10%       Safe and Drug-free schools   472   660   40%       \"Dislocated\" workers   1,118   1,465   31%       Health Mr. Clinton's health plan aside, the budget envisions large spending increases for a select series of preventive care and drug-rehabilitation programs. Spending in the 1995 fiscal year for the National Institutes of Health's many units -- the National Cancer Institute, National Institute for Mental Health, and so on -- would rise a little over 7 per cent, to $11 billion.

But with crime atop the list of public concerns in polls, the new budget mirrors political reality, and seeks big increases for more police and for prosecuting and jailing wrongdoers.

Public Works One area where the Clinton Administration differs from its Republican predecessors is in its support for construction projects. Democrats believe economic growth flows directly from investments in highways and mass transportation. But even here, the Administration is selective: for example, grants for operating expenses of mass transit systems (13 percent of which is spent in metropolitan New York) would be cut to $600 million from $800 million.

LOSERS Foreign Affairs The State Department would take it on the nose, losing a bigger share of its budget than any other Cabinet agency. Total foreign affairs funding, which includes items like Pentagon military aid and export loans, stays stable but loses ground to inflation. Aid to Israel ($3 billion) and Egypt ($1.8 billion) would not change. A growth area: aid to the United Nations for troops in foreign war zones, up 33 per cent.

Energy Department stockpiles of nuclear materials would be drawn down. One weapon prospers: the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, beloved by the National Rifle Association and despised by liberals, rises $61,000 to $2.54 million.

Then he circled the green, touching them all. This was last Saturday, at the end of the third round of the A.T.&T. Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and the goofy scene would have made a great close to the CBS broadcast.   But except for the delighted gallery in the grandstands at golf's most famous finishing hole, no one saw the sight gag. Murray had been consigned to the last tee time on Saturday by the PGA Tour, insuring that he would get a minimum of television exposure. You can't blame Murray's lack of air time on Frank Chirkinian, the CBS producer.

But if the global climate system behaves this year as it has in recent years, scientists say, April and May will bring the latest in a series of abnormally warm springs. This would shrink the snow cover of the entire Northern Hemisphere to a historically small area, and with the cooling effects of the snow lessened, the springtime climate would warm even more. The result: a canceling out of the cold of January and February that would, on balance, make the first half of 1994 warmer than normal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"President Plans to Raise Drug Treatment Budget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/us/clinton-budget-anti-drug-effort-president-plans-raise-drug-treatment-budget.html","abstract":"  Following through on a campaign promise, President Clinton today proposed a sharp increase in spending for drug treatment and programs to prevent drug abuse.

More than a footnote and less than a household name, Mr. Kooper has been most widely heard as a sideman -- the keyboardist on Bob Dylan's mid-1960's masterpieces and on the Rolling Stones' \"Let It Bleed\" -- and he discovered and produced the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd.   But he was more visible in two fondly remembered 1960's bands, the Blues Project and the first lineup of Blood, Sweat and Tears, which were fully and partly reunited for the occasion; Blood, Sweat and Tears was billed as Child Is Father to the Man, the name of its debut album. With both bands, Mr. Kooper was a model of try-everything 1960's eclecticism. The Blues Project dipped into blues, folk-rock and near-jazz; Blood, Sweat and Tears, with its horn section, accessorized 1960's soul with touches of big-band jazz and Renaissance music.

Yet in all the news coverage of skinheads, little attention has been paid to their music. German authorities cite the connection between this music and violence when they add titles to \"the index,\" a list of recordings for which distributors can be prosecuted. According to the Ministry for Women and Youth, there are more than 50 albums and singles on the index.    The authorities have mounted a search and destroy campaign. The most successful raid, in February 1993, brought in more than 30,000 records, tapes and compact discs. A key target has been Rock-O-Rama, a company based in Bruhl. It has 28 bands on its label, including Storkraft, whose lead singer is under investigation for inciting racial hatred and other crimes.   In December, five members of Tonstorung were sentenced to up to 21 months for inciting racial violence, including a 1992 attack on a Turkish wedding party after a concert in Mannheim (the sentences were later suspended). Another band, Radikahl, whose name is a pun combining the German words for radical and bald, was charged in connection with the song \"Swastika,\" which appears here.   These lyrics, collected by the editors of Searchlight, a London-based anti-fascist magazine, and translated by Elizabeth A. Jackson, are typical of neo-Nazi music in their calls for the ethnic purification and military revival of Germany. -- STEPHEN SILVER, staff writer, Searchlight magazine Winter in the F.R.G.

The concert was at times a victim of its own ambition, but its ambition made it special as well. While most tributes to Coltrane venerate the saxophonist for his improvisational ability, this one attempted to rewrite history.   What made the show, presented as part of the Jazz at Lincoln Center series, so complex was its tension between the orthodox interpretations of original material, and the unorthodox. Mr. Jones, who was a member of Coltrane's legendary quartet in the 1960's, was clearly airing out the suites to illustrate Coltrane's approach to composition. He could have chosen to play \"Giant Steps\" with the four or five saxophonists regularly trotted out for Coltrane tributes, but he didn't. In fact, he didn't use a saxophonist at all. And his sidemen -- Wynton Marsalis on trumpet, Marcus Roberts on piano and Reginald Veal on bass -- could have imitated the conventions decreed by the Coltrane quartet of the early 1960's, but they didn't.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"Building Chief Resigns Post, Citing 'Stress'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/nyregion/building-chief-resigns-post-citing-stress.html","abstract":"  New York City's new Buildings Commissioner, Frank A.

Argentine specialists in psychology and psychiatry said in Buenos Aires on Sunday that Maradona needed urgent psychiatric help because, in the words of Mauricio Abadi, the country's best-known psychiatrist, Maradona was \"losing his identity and could become dangerous.\"   According to news reports last week, Maradona fired at journalists with an air rifle outside his sprawling country home near Buenos Aires after he was dismissed by his club, Newell's Old Boys, for repeatedly missing practice. He is scheduled to appear in court today to answer those charges. United States    Without a professional league to keep the players sharp every week, the World Cup team of the United States has been the most active in its preparation for next summer.   After a victory over Norway and ties against Switzerland and Russia last month, the Americans left for Hong Kong yesterday to play in a tournament this week that includes Denmark and Romania.   Coach Bora Milutinovic took 18 players to Hong Kong, where the Americans will open against Denmark on Thursday. None of the players on the squad for the Hong Kong event play in Europe.   The Americans will return to California on Monday and leave two days later for the Joe Robbie Cup in Miami, where they will play Bolivia and Sweden in a tournament that also includes Colombia. Belgium    Immigration authorities have approved the naturalization of Josef Weber of Croatia that will allow him to play for Belgium in the World Cup next summer. Weber's citizenship is expected to be rubber-stamped by the Belgian authorities this week so he can play for Belgium as soon as possible. The 29-year-old Weber, who plays for Cercle Brugge, was the leading scorer in the Belgian League last season and is the leading scorer this season. Mexico    The Mexicans have regressed a great deal, especially defensively, since their surge to becoming one of the world's top teams at the end of last year, when they were the first team to qualify for the World Cup and captured the Gold Cup with a 4-0 triumph over the United States in the championship game. After a poor performance in a 1-1 tie with Bulgaria in San Diego last month, the Mexicans suffered a 5-1 loss to Switzerland and were crushed, 4-1, by the Russians last Wednesday night in Oakland, Calif.   What should be of concern to the Mexicans is that Italy, Ireland and Norway, the teams in their group in the World Cup, play a style similar to those of Switzerland and Russia.  Nigeria    The Super Eagles, who have qualified for the first time for the final stages of the World Cup, suffered a setback in their preparation with the cancellation of their tour of South Africa. The South Africans called off the tour, which was supposed to start last Saturday, when the Super Eagles could not guarantee the release from the clubs of their best players, most of whom play outside Nigeria.  Switzerland    After boycotting a meeting of the Swiss Football Association, members of the World Cup team have been offered improved bonuses for the World Cup and for qualifying for the final stages of the tournament for the first time since 1966. The Swiss will be the first opponent for the Americans. They will play June 18 at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., in the first World Cup game to be played in an indoor stadium.

The unreasonable bias of United States support given to Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani (the most anti-American fanatics in Afghanistan) has never been adequately explained.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"European Union Issues a Warning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/world/european-union-issues-a-warning.html","abstract":"  Foreign Ministers of the European Union, meeting in Brussels, called for the immediate end of the Serbian siege of Sarajevo and said they would take \"all the means necessary, including the use of air power,\" to get Serbian forces to lift their 22-month encirclement of Bosnia's capital. But their statement fell far short of a French request for a deadline. France wants the Serbian nationalist forces in Bosnia to withdraw to a distance of 18 miles from Sarajevo and hand over all their heavy weapons or face a NATO air assault.

Ms. D'Orleans Juste magically made each solo a whole new world.    As a woman awaiting her lover in her \"Virginie,\" a world premiere, she looked vulnerable. With only a few heightened gestures, she turned confident as she danced to music by a French-Canadian group called La Bottine Souriante. But when the woman's lover never arrived, she appeared to be on the brink of madness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"Review/Pop; Merengue Fest for the Ears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/arts/review-pop-merengue-fest-for-the-ears.html","abstract":"  For three hours of nonstop music, the rhythm of merengue reigned on Saturday night at Radio City Music Hall. The speedy boom-chicka-boom, paced by tambora drum and guiro (metal scraper), was pumped out by six hit-making groups. Each band was a notch better than the previous one, so the music traced a rising curve of professional jubilation.    Like other dance music, modern merengue doesn't offer much variety. The rhythm arrives fast or faster, carrying dance exhortations or laments about lost love; in a ballad, the beat is a double-time undercurrent. As trumpets, saxophones and keyboards weave arpeggiated riffs through the syncopation, the vocals soar and sob. Every group had a song rhyming bailar (to dance) and gozar (to have a good time); every group had uniforms and dance routines. The variations were in the nuances of arrangements and the proportions of dance, humor and romance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"War Crimes Without Punishment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/opinion/war-crimes-without-punishment.html","abstract":"  The slaughter of 68 people at a crowded market in Sarajevo on Saturday brutally demonstrates how ineffectual Western leaders and the United Nations have been in stopping the genocide in Bosnia. Less noticed is the discreet gutting of the one opportunity for justice -- however inadequate -- that the international community had promised to the citizens of that abused country.    The teeth are being pulled from the International War Crimes Tribunal, set up by the U.N. Security Council with fanfare last year. The U.N.'s War Crimes Commission, which is charged with assembling evidence, will soon be disbanded. This is being done by the very statesmen who hailed the tribunal -- at least publicly -- as the means of insuring that however unfavorable a peace settlement would be to the Bosnians, they could at least see justice done to the perpetrators of mass rape, murder and torture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"CBS to Skate Circles Around Rival Shows","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/sports/winter-olympics-tv-sports-cbs-to-skate-circles-around-rival-shows.html","abstract":"  You hate to admit that the attack by a few yahoos on Nancy Kerrigan was good for figure skating's exposure, but, well, it's true.
