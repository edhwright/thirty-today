Pointing to a theme of redemption in the programming this year (most notably in Beethoven's \"Fidelio\"), he opened with Henry Cowell's brash \"Return,\" written in 1940 when Cowell was released from a three-year prison term.   Mr. Kennedy directed the series from 1990 to 1992 but bailed out last year after a dispute with the new music director, Steven Mercurio. Now everything has changed. Gian Carlo Menotti, who founded the festival in 1977 and directed it through 17 seasons, resigned last fall after years of farcical bickering with the board and the city, and Milton Rhodes, the former director of the American Council for the Arts, took over as general manager. Mr. Mercurio left, and his predecessor, Spiros Argiris, was reinstated as part of a triumvirate of artistic directors. Mr. Kennedy's brief exile has ended.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"McLean Is Hero In Canuck Revival","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/sports/hockey-mclean-is-hero-in-canuck-revival.html","abstract":"  To reach the Stanley Cup finals, the Rangers had to get past the Devils and their brilliant young goaltender, Martin Brodeur.

Since \"An Early Frost\" in 1985, pitifully few network movies (traditionally addicted to diseases of every stripe), have tackled one of the century's deadliest viruses. What had been known exclusively as a \"gay disease\" became a lightning rod for various groups ready to pounce on any depiction of homosexuals that might look sympathetic. But very gradually, times are changing on commercial television, not least because of the success of films like \"Philadelphia\" and HBO's \"And the Band Played On\" (subsequently given a network broadcast).    Tonight on NBC there's \"Roommates,\" starring Randy Quaid and Eric Stoltz as the title characters. Mr. Quaid is Jim Flynn, a homophobic former convict on parole for bank robbery. He contracted the disease from a blood transfusion. Mr. Stoltz is Bill Thomas, a gay, Harvard-educated expert in government grants. Bill plays Chopin at his family's comfortable home in mid-America.

The improvising trio consists of two permanent members -- the cellist Tom Cora and the percussionist Samm Bennett -- and one guest musician. The band's operating principle is simple: two against one. Mr. Cora and Mr. Bennett team to provide either a simple musical backdrop for the featured soloist or, more often, a latticework of rhythm and noise that keeps their guest on edge.   On Wednesday night at the Knitting Factory, with the reeds player Kazutoki Umezu sitting in, Third Person sounded more like a cohesive band than an improvisatory game. Mr. Umezu, who has played with Third Person several times, responded quickly and humorously to Mr. Cora and Mr. Bennett's musical promptings. When Mr. Cora began scraping his cello in quick, small strokes, as if trying to remove a stain from one of the strings, Mr. Umezu took out a penny whistle and blew a tune for him to work to.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"Applying Antitrust to Insurance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/opinion/applying-antitrust-to-insurance.html","abstract":"  Price-fixing and other anti-consumer practices plague the insurance industry because the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act exempts the industry from antitrust laws. But after decades of struggle, relief is in sight. Last week Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, with representatives of the industry and consumer groups, announced an agreement to pare back the exemption. A detailed bill has not been written yet. But the basic proposal appears to be good for consumers and fair to insurers.   Property and casualty insurers, especially the small companies, argue that they need to share data on claims so they can price products according to the best available information. That is a valid argument -- and Mr. Brooks's plan would preserve the right of insurers to share raw data. But the companies have also used their antitrust exemption to jointly analyze the raw data in order to project future claims losses. These shared projections become the basis for collusively setting prices. That would be a crime in any other industry; Mr. Brooks's bill would also make it, and several other collusive practices, illegal in insurance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"1894:Germany Protests : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/opinion/IHT-1894germany-protests-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"BERLIN - The Imperial German Government has formally protested against the Anglo-Belgian treaty on the ground mainly that the frontiers of the Congo Free State having been fixed by an international convention, they cannot be modified in any way save by in","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"CLINTON CRITICIZED AS TOO AMBITIOUS WITH VACCINE PLAN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/us/clinton-criticized-as-too-ambitious-with-vaccine-plan.html","abstract":"  Members of Congress and makers of drugs say the Clinton Administration has gone far beyond what Congress intended when it passed legislation last year to insure that all children would be vaccinated.

The speakers ranged from the cartoonist Cathy Guisewite to the Presidential adviser David R. Gergen. These excerpts were taken from transcripts provided by the respective universities and colleges. North Carolina Central University, May 14  VERNON E. JORDAN JR. Lawyer   Those students of the 1960's, your mothers and fathers, were in the grip of a powerful idea -- the idea of equality -- whose time they hastened and whose force overcame the tread of mighty armies of racism and segregation. They took that maturing experience to become pioneers themselves, blazing trails in corporate America in government and in the professions. You may think that's ancient history, events that happened before you were born. But the struggle is not over. Yesterday's students began something that today's young people must finish. For despite the tremendous gains that have taken place over the past three decades, too much -- far too much -- remains the same. Discrimination still flourishes, although it is now illegal. . . . You must enter into the serious business of helping black people survive and thrive in the 21st century. Catholic University, May 14  TED KOPPEL Television journalist     Our society finds truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form, truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproach. What Moses brought down from Mount Sinai were not the Ten Suggestions. They are commandments. Are, not were. The sheer brilliance of the Ten Commandments is that they codify in a handful of words acceptable human behavior, not just for then or now, but for all time. . . . The tension between those commandments and our baser instincts provides grist for journalism's daily mill. What a huge, gaping void there would be in our informational flow and in our entertainment without the routine violation of the Fifth through Tenth Commandments. . . . Tell me if this doesn't remind you of something: 'Honor thy mother and father. Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness.' Sounds like a script outline for the story of the Menendez brothers, doesn't it? Juilliard School, May 20  JANE ALEXANDER Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts   This occasion lends itself to speculation, to the bittersweet. The poet Samuel Hazo writes about life's journey in a poem called \"The First and Only Sailing,\" of which I'll quote the last few lines:   Expect nothing,   and anything seems everything.   Expect everything, and anything   seems nothing.   To live   you leave your yesterselves   to drown without a funeral.   You chart a trek where no   one's sailed before.   You rig. You anchor up. You sail.    Your time at Juilliard has been spent learning when to tack or when to open your sails to the wind; it has been filled with hard work and wild ideas, friendship, love, the camaraderie of community. Ithaca College, May 14  JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU Oceanographer   As a culture, we are coming to our senses after a 40- or 50-year bad trip of raping the natural and human environment as if there is no tomorrow. Today, we recognize that current industrial society is literally unsustainable. We admit that trashing the future is bad business. . . . You will inherit a planet that, while remarkably resilient, is unmistakably damaged. But today we have the opportunity to turn society around and point our policies, our technology, our dreams in a more positive direction. State University of New York at Geneseo, May 14  DAVID R. GERGEN   Counselor to President Clinton  People who are willing to get off the sidelines and get into the arena make the difference. Your generation has been dismissed as too cynical, too skeptical, and you have reason. After all, the faith has been broken too many times in the past. There is no guarantee that we as a people will succeed. But if you don't get into the arena, I guarantee you we will fail. Syracuse University  KURT VONNEGUT Novelist   I had a bad uncle named Dan, who said a male can't be a man unless he'd gone to war. But I had a good uncle named Alex, who said, when life was most agreeable -- and it could be just a pitcher of lemonade in the shade -- he would say, \"If this isn't nice, what is?\" . . . Now, if he hadn't said that so regularly, maybe five or six times a month, we might not have paused to notice how rewarding life can be sometimes. Perhaps my good Uncle Alex will live on in some of you members of the Syracuse Class of 1994 if, in the future, you will pause to say out loud every so often, \"If this isn't nice, what is?\" Gettysburg College, May 22  ANDY ROONEY Television commentator    I was thinking -- just as an example of how much the times influence what a person does with his life -- if Abraham Lincoln were alive today, would he be standing here making his Gettysburg Address and saying, \"Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation . . .\"? Of course not. The nation isn't new any more. He'd have to say, \"Ten score and 18 years ago.\" . . . Lincoln would probably be a relatively obscure lawyer who was turned down for the Supreme Court because he and Mary had a live-in maid for whom they never paid Social Security. Haverford College, May 15  CORNEL WEST Harvard University professor    I have only a brief word for the class of 1994, namely that you are now part of a tradition of rich Quakerism on the one hand, but also of grand but still flawed democratic tradition on the other. I think T. S. Eliot was absolutely right when he wrote in 1919 that tradition is not something you inherit. If you want it, you must obtain it with great labor. It is a perennial process. And it means then that one is going to have to cut radically against the American grain, because it means on the one hand, you are going to have to have a sense of history and understand the present as history. And in my own humble opinion, the major forms of idolatry of our day are the market way of life and the tribal way of life. The Citadel, May 14  SENATOR BOB DOLE    American leadership is still required. And sometimes that leadership will mean that Americans will make the supreme sacrifice.  . . . Is it America's destiny to be the world's policeman? No. There are crimes against humanity and against freedom committed every day in countless countries across the world, and America does not go in, guns blazing, to make it right. Instead we lead by example. . . . If we are to maintain our credibility as an economic and moral influence, then we must deal with our problems, like the deficit and crime. And we must remember and teach the values that made America great -- values like decency, honesty and individual responsibility. Wesleyan University  LOWELL P. WEICKER JR. Governor of Connecticut     A few weeks ago I went to South Africa to attend the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela. An event so sweeping as this was undreamed of even by its most ardent supporters. . . . Decades of legally dehumanizing all races but white were buried under an avalanche of paper ballots. Yet there was not one of us witnessing history in Pretoria, as representatives of the United States, who didn't comprehend that what was ending in South Africa as a matter of law was thriving in our own country as a matter of practice. The long moral finger of outrage that we for so long had pointed at South Africa was now more properly directed at ourselves. University of Michigan, April 30  CATHY GUISEWITE Cartoonist    I graduated with a class committed to open love, open thinking open doors, open everything. . . . Twenty-two years later, the people of my class are getting cash out of a machine, dinner out of a clown's mouth and it isn't even possible to get a human being on the phone at the phone company. In Los Angeles, my only chance of having a meaningful encounter with a person is if I smash into one with my car. . . . You've grown up in a strange time where people seem more bonded by the bad stuff than the good. Where in a lot of communities the main common link between neighbors is that everyone knows someone who's been mugged. Everyone knows someone in rehab. And everyone's been touched by a life that ended way too soon. If you want something to change, you personally have to do something different. You have to take a stand when it isn't convenient. Try something nobody else has tried. Defy your own group. Rebel against yourself. Knock down your walls and get out of your way. University of Southern California, May 6  STEVEN SPIELBERG Film maker    It doesn't matter what path we take, we have to remain curious and fearless. We have to look at the world and question what we see. We have to be unafraid to say no and change what is unacceptable. Each of us has the ability to do this. Each of us has the responsibility to do it. New York University, May 12  JAMES EARL JONES Actor    You are facing new worlds of technology so fast that if they don't throw you into a catatonic fit, they will challenge your imagination just to keep up, and threaten to overwhelm your ability to absorb it. It has been predicted that the social implications of this technology promise to be somewhere between the eruption of a volcano and the discovery of fire. Susquehanna University, May 15  CHAIM POTOK Novelist   You can detach the two lines that form an X and realign them so that they take the shape of a gallows, a crucifix, a plus sign, an equals sign. What will it be, this X Decade? A decade of growing hatreds, hardening separations and Balkan tribalism? A decade of continuing postmodern, American-style lynchings and crucifixions? Or a decade in which we add to the well-being of the country? A decade in which we learn more about the true nature of equality for all Americans? Carnegie-Mellon University, May 17  LAWRENCE ELLISON Software-company executive    Within a decade or so, anyone will be able to view anything from anywhere at anytime. Text, numbers, audio and high-resolution video will all be integrated on your screen. . . . The impact of these innovations will be no less than that of Westinghouse's electric power on demand. They will so profoundly change our world that 20 years from now, scarcely anyone will be able to remember what life was like without them. Boston University, May 22  ROSS PEROT Former Presidential candidate    Financial success and happiness are unrelated. . . . I'm no happier today than I was as a boy in the depression in Texarkana. I was rich then because of my parents. . . . A bell is no bell till you ring it. Don't just sit there and look at the bell, ring it. A song is no song till you sing it. Forget everything I've said so far and listen to these last two lines. This is the most important thing I'll say: Love in your heart isn't put there to stay, love isn't love till you give it away. Johns Hopkins Medical School, May 26  DAVID A. KESSLER Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration   We have known of the dangers of smoking for more than 30 years. But only recently has a picture begun to emerge of the decisions and the research that have been occurring inside the tobacco industry about the hazards of cigarettes. It is time to ask the tough questions. We cannot passively cede to the tobacco industry the right to determine the future health of so many of our children. University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill, May 15  DR. FRANCIS S. COLLINS Director, National Center for Human Genome Research    Dr. Collins, a geneticist, spoke effusively of the enduring nature of love and romance. You could say he was inspired: three weeks earlier, a graduating business administration major, James Vanke, asked Dr. Collins to help him propose to his girlfriend, a classmate. In a letter, he urged the scientist to be \"as cheesy as possible.\"   I encourage each of you to consider these three questions and decisions carefully. What will be your life's work? What are you going to do about faith? And what role will love play in your life? . . . Love should be the center of life, the enduring, glowing fire. And I'm happy to see no evidence currently of it dying out. And if you don't accept that, I would like to present as evidence Exhibit A over here in the business section. I would like to ask James Vanke and Suzanne Woloski to please stand up. Right here, right in the front. O.K., everybody, James and Suzanne have been dating for over a year and as you can see, they are head over heels in love. And so, folks, right here, in front of 30,000 people, we are about to witness a big moment. Suzanne didn't know about this. Suzanne, James wants to know if you will do him the honor of becoming his wife. . . . She said yes. Love conquers all.

Instead, they say, AIDS should be seen as a disease of DNA. Since H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, integrates itself into the DNA of the chromosomes, they argue, the methods of gene therapy and molecular biology should be used to attack the virus as it subverts the cell's genetic machinery, almost as if it were a mutant human gene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940531","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/31/us/no-headline-250252.html","abstract":"  Ezra Taft Benson, the president of the Mormon Church since 1985 and a Secretary of Agriculture in the Eisenhower Administration, died yesterday at his home in Salt Lake City.

Ms. Segarra and Dr. Impellizzeri have been in the majority of a divided 4-to-3 board that has been less preoccupied with education than with social issues, like AIDS education and a curriculum that would teach tolerance of homosexuals and different cultural groups.
