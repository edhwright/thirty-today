Just as the Communists are about to knock the crown from his head, a dashing young monarch slips out of his Eastern European homeland on the Orient Express, taking with him a collection of Old Master paintings, some of which he deposits in a Swiss vault. More than 45 years later, the Communists' successors, who value the art at more than $500 million, want it back.   That is the story being told by the Government of Romania, which is suing the onetime King Michael, now 71, for the return of works by El Greco, Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Breughel and others. Two suits, one filed in Switzerland and the other in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, could turn on questions of interpretation of a 104-year-old document: which country has jurisdiction over the matter, and, after nearly half a century, have Romania's legal rights expired?","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"Not Exactly an Affair Tennis Will Remember","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/sports/tennis-not-exactly-an-affair-tennis-will-remember.html","abstract":"  They came, they competed, they complained.

She twirled around in a velvet frock and tossed her hair around, rocker style. She punched her fist into the air. But when the spotlight on the drums and the guitarist faded, and Ms. King sat at the piano, her fans quickly turned silent. They were rapt in anticipation of what old songs she would sing, of what little piece of life Ms. King would lay bare with her lyrics.\n\nThat the theater's sound technicians twisted knobs from \"muddy\" at the beginning of the evening to \"extra loud\" for the duration was only a minor irritation: Ms. King's performance was effervescent. Thoughtfully planned and loosely executed, Ms. King easily balanced old and new material. Never folky, maudlin or cabaretlike, Ms. King's performance combined the best of singer-songwriter sensibilities and rambunctious showmanship. Some of her moves seemed calculated (like the inclusion of a black choir for two songs), and some of her newer songs, like \"Hold On,\" sounded like positive-thinking tracts. As she performed a song co-written with Mariah Carey, \"If It's Over,\" Ms. King screeched through a note Ms. Carey probably would have hit precisely. Her encore included \"Been to Canaan,\" \"You've Got a Friend\" and the Little Eva classic \"The Locomotion,\" which Ms. King co-wrote with Gerry Goffin. By that time she'd validated every memory the thirty- and fortysomething audience had dredged up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"A New Asbestos Setback","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/nyregion/a-new-asbestos-setback.html","abstract":"  The agency inspecting for asbestos in the New York City schools failed yesterday to provide the new Chancellor with a report he had ordered to determine which classrooms could open and which would have to remain closed next week.

Alfred A. Knopf. $22.     Like the heroines of Susanna Moore's other two novels (\"My Old Sweetheart\" and \"The Whiteness of Bones\"), Clio Lynott is an \"island girl,\" a girl brought up in the fierce, Edenic beauty of Hawaii, and unprepared for the confusions and seductions of that other world that lies, beckoning, on the other side of the ocean. Like theirs, hers is the story of a woman's search for identity and her attempt to mediate between the claims of the past and the present, family and self, home and the world.   Clio is the cousin of Mamie, the heroine of \"The Whiteness of Bones,\" and she shares Mamie's tortuous family history. Clio's great-grandmother was a full Hawaiian princess who married a shipwrecked Irish sailor in 1871; her dowry, Ms. Moore writes, included \"a coastal plain on the island of O'ahu that was one day to become the city of Honolulu.\" Her house, once the center of all that was lovely in island society, has been handed down to Clio's eccentric aunt Emma, the self-appointed custodian of the family's past.   Clio's own immediate family has disintegrated, a victim of the centrifugal forces of selfishness and dislocation. Her mother, Kitty, a flighty, impulsive woman vaguely reminiscent of Lily's mother in \"My Old Sweetheart,\" has abandoned Clio and her brother, Dix, to start a new life with a new husband in Australia; she occasionally mails Clio presents -- a flea- bitten ermine muff, a stained bed jacket, an alligator handbag with a broken clasp -- then later asks for them back.   Clio's father, John Lynott, is an equally negligent parent. He marries a cruel, mocking woman named Burta and allows her to terrorize his children: Burta starves Clio and Dix, humiliates them and kills their beloved pets. Unable to cope any longer, Clio runs away from home to live with her aunt Emma.   Emma's house, formerly the princess' town residence, is filled with treasures from Hawaii's past: feather capes from the time of Kamehameha I, carved idols with abalone-shell eyes, koa chests filled with musty, fragrant antiques. And Emma has set herself the task of preserving Hawaii's less tangible treasures from the past: the long songs without meter or rhyme known as meles, the oral genealogies of its island families, its hulas and its myths of gods and goddesses and spirits. Knowledge of such matters is disappearing in the new Hawaii of tourists and fancy hotels, and she wants Clio to become \"the next keeper of the flame\"; she wants Clio to become the repository of the family's and the islands' history.   This dedication to the past has already warped the lives of Emma and her mother, Mabel. Many years ago, each of them gave up the chance to run away with the man she loved to stay on at the family homestead. Both now live willfully in the past: Emma spends hours recording and memorizing \"the lore of her race\"; Mabel actually thinks she's living in a bygone era, inviting the likes of Mark Twain and Jack London for tea.   Clio dutifully absorbs her aunt's lessons, and she soon finds she can \"no longer separate what had happened a hundred years earlier from what she had dreamed in the night.\" \"She used to say laughingly,\" Ms. Moore writes, \"that she knew the ritual ceremony for wrapping the bones of a chief, but she could not divide fractions. She could steer an outrigger canoe through rough seas, but she had never learned to iron.\"   The weight of her family's past, however, has begun to suffocate Clio, and she yearns to explore the bright, mysterious world beyond Hawaii's shores. At the age of 27, she meets and marries a movie star named Tommy Haywood, a modern-day Prince Charming who is her complete opposite, a man without a past, a man who lives relentlessly in the present. Tommy -- who seems to have been modeled on another Tom, Tom Buchanan, the hard-nosed, careless husband of Daisy in \"The Great Gatsby\" -- takes Clio away to California and introduces her to a world of rich, vapid movie people, a farcical West Coast version of the frivolous world of New York socialites encountered by Mamie in \"The Whiteness of Bones.\"   This world is delineated in overly bright comic-book colors of greed, stupidity and shallowness, very different from the lyrically described world of Hawaii rendered in a shimmering chiaroscuro of soft, tropical tints; and it's consequently hard to understand why someone as thoughtful and intelligent as Clio would linger there for even a moment. And yet she does linger, convinced that Tommy has awakened her from years of sleepwalking, convinced that she has escaped the fate of her aunt and her grandmother. It is only when her marriage comes to a sudden and violent end that she is forced to return home to Hawaii and finally grapple with her family's emotional legacy.   Clearly \"Sleeping Beauties\" would be a better novel if Ms. Moore had modulated her satire of Tommy's Hollywood world and depicted the people surrounding Clio in more muted, realistic terms. As it is, Tommy and Clio's father and stepmother are cardboard villains, devoid of any real emotional reality, and hence flimsy foils to Clio's dreams and aspirations.   What redeems the book is Ms. Moore's persuasive ability to delineate Clio's inner life and the place she has come from. Clio's childhood in Hawaii and her relationships with her aunt and grandmother are so fervently and authentically described that we feel we know her, not just as a character, but also as a flesh-and-blood human being. As a result, we can sympathize with her struggles both to embrace and to flee the claims of her past. For all its problems, \"Sleeping Beauties\" ratifies Ms. Moore's earlier achievements and attests to her lucid, poetic gifts as a writer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"Hyperion to Publish Ripper Manuscript","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/books/hyperion-to-publish-ripper-manuscript.html","abstract":"  Hyperion announced yesterday that it would publish a manuscript presented as the diary of Jack the Ripper, even though another publisher, Warner Books, asserted last week that the diary was fake and canceled its own publication plans.   \"This is a fascinating document, and the questions it raises are equally absorbing,\" Robert Miller, the vice president and publisher of Hyperion, said in a statement.

Yet for all its galactic sweep when it strikes, migraine is a mundane and commonplace ailment, afflicting about 12 percent of the population. It is a trait passed along from parent to offspring with the seeming ease of wispy hair or nearsightedness: three-quarters of all sufferers are thought to have an inherited predisposition to the disorder.   Neurologists and other researchers have long been fascinated by migraines, by the shimmering, hallucinatory auras that can accompany or on their own constitute an episode, by the concurrence of a pulsating, often one-sided headache and roiling waves of nausea that are migraine's wretched hallmarks, and by the strongly familial nature of the disease. But while the physicians of ancient Egypt and Greece vividly described the headaches and suggested a variety of herbal and opiate therapies to ease the pain, only now are scientists gaining real insight into the physiology and genetics of migraines.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"1918:Revolutionary Dies : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/opinion/IHT-1918revolutionary-dies-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - The death is announced from Zurich, says the Figaro, of Madame Catherine Breshkovskaia, the \"Grandmother of the Revolution.\" She died in Russia - it is not stated exactly where - and according to German statements she will be buried at t","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"Review/Television; Prime-Time Comedy With a Sting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/arts/review-television-prime-time-comedy-with-a-sting.html","abstract":"  With adorable parents and cuddly children hogging much of the prime-time television schedule these days, chronic grumps may be understandably desperate for a dose or two of humor with bite.

Lightweight though \"The Mikado\" is, this production is one of the most delightful in the company's repertory, and it has retained its freshness. Originally staged by Lotfi Mansouri, and now directed by Christian Smith, it plays on subtle contrasts. Thierry Bosquet's sets, for example, are delicate Oriental hangings and screens, painted in pastel shades. But his costumes use bright reds and greens.

Green swept past a field of five opponents to win a resounding victory in the campaign to be New York City's Public Advocate, the position formerly known as City Council President.   Mr. Green, a longtime colleague of Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, had long been considered the front-runner in the crowded field of candidates. But the strength of his victory came as a surprise to many political analysts and the other candidates because it had widely been expected that in a field of six candidates, Mr. Green would have great difficulty amassing the 40 percent minimum to avoid a runoff.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930915","headline":"The Primary Races, District by

They have both reached the top -- and they have to be amazed at the different way they got there.   Hamilton was supposed to be the blue-chip draft pick. Going into his final year at Pitt in 1991, he was considered one of the top pass rushers in college, but something happened on the way to becoming a first-rounder. He was tagged as a problem child, a big-time talent minus the work ethic. None of these labels were ever really confirmed, but the whispers resulted in Hamilton's slipping to the fourth round of the 1992 draft, where the Giants snapped him up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930916","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/nyregion/c-corrections-899093.html","abstract":"  A picture yesterday with an obituary of Iva Sergei Voidato Patcevitch, a retired chairman of Conde Nast Publications, was published in error.

Mr. Mamikonian, a 23-year-old Armenian pianist who has studied with Jorg Demus and Lazar Berman -- polar opposites, one would think -- demonstrated a technique that combines power and gracefulness, an ear for stylistic nuance and flashes of interpretive ingenuity.

Guru, who is half the hard-core hip-hop duo Gang Starr, is known for his monotonal and blase delivery and thoughtful if raw lyrics. The show, like his own album, \"Jazzmatazz Vol. 1,\" is Guru's attempt at fusing jazz and hip-hop. The two genres, often compared because of their similar origins, existed symbiotically onstage. Each was clearly if only slightly changed by the other.  It was an easy fusion, almost as if the fuss over it is unwarranted.\n\nBy the time the band went into \"Transit Ride,\" a lyrical tour of New York's subways, the band had melded. Guru was on point with one of his best songs and the horn section, highlighted by the sweet-sounding hollowness of Donald Byrd's trumpet, was blowing in rich unison. The guitarist Zachary Breaux was making his funky presence known, and the disk jockey, Jazzy Nice, contributed the occasional well-timed scratch from the turntables. It was, beautifully, the fusion to which Guru aspires.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930916","headline":"Let's Decriminalize Big-Time College Sports; Profits for Athletics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/opinion/l-let-s-decriminalize-big-time-college-sports-profits-for-athletics-035893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Cleaning Up College Football\" (editorial, Aug. 29) repeats a common canard when it says, \"Athletes make millions for their schools.\" To the extent that the athletic departments in universities \"make millions,\" the funds are retained for the benefit of the athletic departments.

On one, \"The Big Gundown,\" he rewrote the music of the film composer Ennio Morricone, but on two others, \"Godard,\" from 1985, and \"Spillane,\" from 1986, Mr. Zorn constructed pieces out of scraps and shards of musical styles, clearly meaning to evoke the emotional textures of Godard's films and the writing of Mickey Spillane.   Nearly 10 years later, as part of a month of Mr. Zorn's music at the Knitting Factory, the \"Godard\" and \"Spillane\" pieces have re-emerged. Although they seemed radical when they first appeared, they don't now: Mr. Zorn's practice is now part of the common vocabulary. The compositions just sound good, and it is easier with hindsight to see why the works radiate pleasure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930916","headline":"AFTER THE PRIMARY: Nassau; Cameras, Over Here!
