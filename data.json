There was no self-indulgence, no lingering over piquant resolutions, no italicizing of shocking modulations. If the heavens were stormed, it was by using strategic gestures; if the transcendent was alluded to, it was only via the common-sense declamation of the notes on the page. Mr. Barenboim was not a structuralist or impressionist or sensualist. He was not divine or demonic or otherworldly. He was simply himself.   This was often more than enough. But the results would have been even more compelling had Mr. Barenboim's purely pianistic accomplishments been at peak level. It is doubtful that any virtuoso could carry on Mr. Barenboim's full-time conducting career and still maintain a prodigious technique that would make the fearsome thrusts and brio patter of the Opus 111 Sonata chilling, or allow the textures in the \"Waldstein\" Sonata to become hauntingly transparent.

Richie Ashburn also threw Cal Abrams out at home to help the Phillies win the 1950 pennant, which is duly remembered by aging Brooklyn Dodgers fans, but that isn't why Ashburn was selected by the Veterans Committee, either.   Ashburn was selected because he was just about as good as a center fielder can be, without bashing the ball over the fence 40 times a year. Not every great center fielder is Willie, Mickey or the Duke, but there should be room in the shrine near the shore of Lake Otesaga for a player who batted .308 over 15 years and ran down most line drives in the power alleys.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950308","headline":"HOUSE APPROVES MEASURE TO LIMIT FEDERAL LAWSUITS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/08/us/house-approves-measure-to-limit-federal-lawsuits.html","abstract":"  Voting largely along party lines, the House of Representatives today passed legislation intended to curtail sharply the increasing number of lawsuits brought in Federal courts.

This means it is harder both to lose and, perhaps surprising to some, to gain weight than to maintain the same level. In the study, researchers found that in volunteers who gained weight, metabolism was speeded up by 10 percent to 15 percent, and in those who lost weight, metabolism was 10 percent to 15 percent slower than normal.

Even the museum-quality examples of this stuff are uncomfortably reminiscent of hotel rooms and Chinese restaurants.    The ceramics in \"New Finds, Old Treasures: Early Chinese Ceramics From the Meiyintang Collection,\" at the Asia Society, do not look like hotel-room furniture.

In contrast, the Ming and Ching styles date from the 14th century to early this century and were made largely for export. The Chinese kept the good stuff for themselves.

The principal sponsor, Hugo Boss, even furnished Mr. Bleckner with the suit he wore to his opening, an event paid for by another sponsor, Vanity Fair magazine, which recently published an admiring profile of the artist.   None of this would signify anything, of course, beyond Mr. Bleckner's personal good fortune, if his work justified a big show at a major museum.

Renowned for its innovative shootouts, this mournful, arch-masculine classic is by now associated with a different kind of battle. The fight to release a restored, wide-screen director's cut of \"The Wild Bunch,\" which was rated R in 1969 but barely escaped an NC-17 this year, is more significant to Peckinpah's reputation than the slow-motion blood spurts that once seemed so bold.

As is clear from the name, Mekka strives to be a gathering place; it has altered the conventional spelling so as not to offend anybody. Befitting its Avenue A location, Mekka, with its modern halogen lights, long bar, wood floor and black-and-red candles, draws a handsome, integrated crowd.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950310","headline":"Sifting Through the Grab Bag for Pearls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/arts/photography-review-sifting-through-the-grab-bag-for-pearls.html","abstract":"  Shows of a museum's recent acquisitions are by their nature grab bags, and the exhibition of such works now on display in the Museum of Modern Art's photography galleries is no exception. It includes a varied selection of images that have come to the museum, either as gifts or by purchase, over the last two years.   An air of the unexpected surrounds the best acquisitions shows, with curators often seeming like beachcombers proudly displaying treasures washed in by the tide. The Modern's show, organized by Peter Galassi, head of the department of photography, includes remarkably little flotsam and jetsam, and more than a few undeniable pearls.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950310","time":"1995-03-10
