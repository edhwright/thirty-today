Similar policies, though less sweeping, have been enacted at dozens of campuses, large and small, and are being considered at many more. Awareness of Harassment    Though a few, notably Harvard University and the University of Iowa, adopted such codes in the mid-1980's, the movement has picked up great speed in just the past year.

Can anyone here play this game? Among the victims were Feydeau and Chekhov (although Shaw fared better with \"St. Joan\"). But nothing can equal \"Three Men on a Horse,\" which opened last night at the Lyceum Theater with a reunion of Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, television's \"Odd Couple.\" This time, Mr. Randall's company is defeated by a double burden of miscasting and maladroit acting. The way to revive \"Three Men on a Horse\" would be to rejuvenate it with an ensemble of young actors and clowns. Instead, the approach is the opposite: a geriatric production.   Since its Broadway premiere in 1935, the John Cecil Holm-George Abbott comedy has proved to be a durable staple and has also inspired two musicals. After the troupe's experience with classics, this lightheaded farce should have been the easy one. In John Tillinger's production, however, the show is as dim and contrived a play as could be imagined. It is far less viable than \"The Show-Off,\" the 1924 George Kelly comedy presented this season at the Roundabout Theater Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930414","headline":"Who's Coach of Year?

With an instrument seemingly made for the vast scale of the Met, she poured out rich, lustrous, nuanced tone with ease and security. Dramatically, however, she seemed stiff and uncommunicative, even more ill at ease than might reasonably be expected in Elijah Moshinsky's elephantine new production of the opera.

During a civil war that began with Angola's independence in 1975, Mr. Savimbi insisted that his Unita rebels were democrats thirsting for a chance at the polls to unseat a leftist Government in Luanda. He got his wish last September, but his rival, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, won by a plurality in a generally fair first-round vote that was to be followed by a runoff. But instead of contesting the runoff, Mr. Savimbi resumed fighting, ferociously.    He has been able to do this, as The Times's Kenneth Noble reports, because Unita cheated on cease-fire terms by pretending to demobilize. Western analysts estimate that Mr. Savimbi kept a force of 30,000 to 35,000 soldiers, while the Luanda Government, with three times that number under arms, complied by downsizing its army to 10,000.

The first step must be for both sides to avoid the traditional omiyage, or gift, of a Japanese stimulus package. For nearly 50 years, Japanese prime ministers have come to Washington bearing gifts that usually have been promises to stimulate their own economy. \n\nIn theory, stimulating Japan's economy is supposed to increase imports and reduce the trade imbalance. In fact, a succession of similar proposals over the last decade has not solved the trade problem. Japan's demand for foreign goods is so unchanging that even a huge stimulus has yielded only a small increase in imports. If past trends hold, Mr. Clinton's proposed $19.5 billion package to stimulate our own economy, which has run into a Congressional roadblock, would create more U.S. imports of Japanese goods than Mr. Miyazawa's $100 billion program would yield in Japanese imports of U.S. goods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930415","headline":"Education Board Breakup Urged","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/15/nyregion/education-board-breakup-urged.html","abstract":"  Three borough presidents proposed yesterday that the city's Board of Education be disbanded and its authority spread among borough boards and local groups.

That draws outrage from City Hall, yet the judge's frustration is understandable.   Families with nowhere to sleep now report to Emergency Assistance Units, where caseworkers, following court rulings, are supposed to find them apartments or hotel rooms. But the demand is such that accommodations can't be found for scores of families -- on some nights well in excess of 100. They bed down on armchairs and couches or on the floors of the waiting rooms. The conditions are uncomfortable for adults and unhealthy, if not downright abusive, for children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930415","headline":"Reports Say Buttafuoco Is Indicted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/15/nyregion/reports-say-buttafuoco-is-indicted.html","abstract":"  The Nassau County District Attorney's office prepared to charge Joseph Buttafuoco today in the statutory rape of Amy Fisher, people familiar with the case said.
