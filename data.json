Recording Studios on West 44th Street all seem to agree that the battle has been lost, and that when the Bertelsmann Music Group moves to its new offices at 1540 Broadway near Times Square at the end of March, the studios will be renovated to accommodate the new offices of the Internal Revenue Service. No sessions are being booked beyond March 31, 1993.    The studios were modernized in 1989, when Bertelsmann invested $3 million in upgrading their equipment. The company, which owns RCA and Arista Records, had expected to be able to continue renting the studios. But Douglas Durst, the vice president of the Durst Organization, said that his company wanted to rent all of the former B.M.G. space to a single tenant and that the Internal Revenue Service had agreed to rent all 10 floors now occupied by the record company.  City Officials' Effort    In December there was an effort by the Rev. Wendell Foster, a City Council member from the Bronx, and Barry Sullivan, a deputy mayor, to work out an arrangement with both the Durst Organization and the I.R.S., by which the studios, at 110 West 44th Street, could be saved. But Mr. Durst said the I.R.S. was not interested in subleasing the studio because it might constitute a security breach.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930215","headline":"'People Smugglers' Send New Tide of Refugees Onto Nordic Shores","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/world/people-smugglers-send-new-tide-of-refugees-onto-nordic-shores.html","abstract":"  A new kind of \"boat people\" are landing on the shores of the Nordic countries, especially Sweden, whose liberal asylum policies have made it a prime destination.

Both measures were defeated. But before the vote on coaches was taken, one faculty adviser quipped that because the extra scholarship was voted down, the extra coach wasn't needed either.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930215","headline":"Leslie E.

The brilliant 16-year-old grandmaster holds a 5 1/2-3 1/2 lead, which cannot be overtaken by the former world champion. But as is often the case in exhibition contests, the players are obliged to complete the schedule.   Polgar repeatedly relied on adventurous pawn sacrifices to deny Spassky the chance for the initiative when she had Black. Her adherence to \"the best defense is a good offense\" school worked well for her; Spassky could not quash her dynamic, aggressive maneuvering and was pretty much hamstrung with White.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930216","headline":"Sports of The Times; The Rangers Celebrate Kiddies' Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-rangers-celebrate-kiddies-day.html","abstract":"  THERE were so many youngsters being escorted into Madison Square Garden that you half expected them all to be twirling flashlights in the darkness and watching the Flying Gutkowskis or some other daredevil circus act.

The case simmered throughout the 1930's, and its underlying tensions are still very much with us. Edgar Nkosi White, a playwright, and Genji Ito, a composer, have built a stylized blues opera from the basic facts of the case.   The plot focuses on Clarence Norris, \"last of the Scottsboro boys,\" who lived to be pardoned by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in 1976. He is represented as a naive, wayward soul who leaves his mother and girlfriend to find work. Thrown summarily into prison, he finds himself the victim of racial hatred. He is about to be lynched when Samuel Leibowitz, constantly referred to as \"a lawyer from New York City,\" arrives on the scene. Leibowitz's defense fails, and Norris breaks out of prison rather than face a death sentence. He finds his girlfriend, Donna Lee, shows up at Leibowitz's apartment in New York and is directed to a hiding place in Harlem. The police recapture him and return him to Alabama. In a vibrant gospel epilogue, he is shown being pardoned by the villainous sheriff, who is seated in Wallace's wheelchair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"Brazilian Sequel: A Jailbreak, a Bitter Widow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/world/brazilian-sequel-a-jailbreak-a-bitter-widow.html","abstract":"  With the killers of Francisco (Chico) Mendes apparently on the run in Bolivia, the widow of Brazil's slain Amazon defender asserted today that the authorities had ignored repeated warnings that security was dangerously lax at the Amazon jail.   \"The authorities knew about the conditions, but they didn't take any measures,\" the widow, Ilzamar Gadelha Mendes, said in a telephone interview from Xapuri, an Amazon town 2,500 miles northwest of here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"2 New Studies Link Vasectomy To Higher Prostate Cancer Risk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/health/2-new-studies-link-vasectomy-to-higher-prostate-cancer-risk.html","abstract":"  Two large new studies being reported on Wednesday add to earlier evidence that a vasectomy may increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer.
