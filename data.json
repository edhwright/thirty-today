Up the slope of Beacon Hill all the gardens are private, even secret, blossoming behind rows of bow-front town houses that line the redbrick sidewalks.   These gardens are linked by a web of back alleys that are wide enough for a cow and tall enough for a boy with a basket on his head, a standard imposed by a city ordinance from the 1830's. Once a year only, this year on May 19, the wrought-iron gates to these serpentine passages are opened to the public for the \"Hidden Gardens of Beacon Hill\" tour.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Untrammeled Madeline Island","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/travel/untrammeled-madeline-island.html","abstract":"FROM the screened porch of the Island Cafe on Madeline Island, we watch an early-morning ferry come in from the mainland. As is customary on any island, the ferry brings a moment of expectancy. On board the Madeline this day in late July are the morning newspapers, the mail and the island's own supply truck jammed with such staples as paper towels and cartons of frozen french fries. The ferry also brings visitors. A mainland tour bus rolls onto the dock, followed by a minivan topped by a bicycle and a canoe, two RV's towing motorboats, and station wagons filled with excited kids in bathing suits. This summer scene is so familiar on resort islands across the United States, but for us Easterners, there's a twist. This island is in Wisconsin. And the waters the ferry has plied belong to Lake Superior.\n\nThis is the first vacation my friend Harvey Loomis and I have taken in the Midwest, prompted by my son who has rerooted his life from New York to Minneapolis. To his Minnesotan wife and their children, Lake Superior is just one of the 10,000 lakes of which their Minnesota license plate boasts. To us, residents of Long Island, where the water out our windows is the Atlantic Ocean, the inland vastness and volatility of Lake Superior seem exotic. As we eat our blueberry muffins, we are surrounded by the lake the Ojibwa Indians called Kitchi-Gami, and Longfellow immortalized as Gitche Gumee.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Puns on 'Rock,' Fine, but Beware of Bamm-Bamm","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/movies/taking-the-children-puns-on-rock-fine-but-beware-of-bamm-bamm-213691.html","abstract":"  Trading Mom  Sissy Spacek, Anna Chlumsky Directed by Tia Brelis PG 82 minutes","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"J.

Before takeoff, his testimony said, he saw passengers around him in rows 33 and 35 smoking, and they resumed after takeoff. Passengers to his left in row 34 also started smoking.

Not many even try. No recent building that I can recall reels in the surreal as stylishly as the new Cartier building in Paris designed by Jean Nouvel, the French architect best known for the Arab World Institute. Some buildings go up in flames. This one melts away like ice. Its crystalline, geometrically precise surfaces of glass and steel dissolve in the light into silhouettes, clouds, reflections, the traffic, trees and skyline of historic Montparnasse.   Talk about Les Must. Those headed to Paris this summer will want to put 261 Boulevard Raspail at the top of their itinerary. For once, the support that the French extend to contemporary architecture inspires not only respect for good intentions but awe at a building it has produced. You can linger here for an hour or longer and not begrudge the time subtracted from a visit to Ste.-Chapelle. In fact these two very different landmarks have something in common: both join the architect's art to the jeweler's. Medieval craftsmen, legendarily, ground up sapphires to enrich the color of stained glass.

That's where the revenue from patrons' losses far exceeded profits from other aspects of hotel operation.   But as Las Vegas's image changes from a gambling town to a family resort, room rates are going up. Among the visitors affected are those taking package trips with tour operators who were previously able to obtain blocks of rooms at extremely low rates. Now that the family market is expanding, major hotels are raising the rates charged to wholesalers in hopes of reclaiming some of the otherwise pre-sold rooms and offering them to families willing to pay rack rates, the rates quoted over the telephone to individual travelers. For example, a couple flying from the East Coast to Las Vegas on a package that included air fare, transfers and accommodations at the MGM Grand paid $928 last month, said Christopher DeSanto, vice president of Santo Tours of Buffalo. That same package is expected to cost about $975 in September. (Next month, however, it will be $906, largely because of lower demand in the summer. Before the room rate increase, though, the June package would have been $798.) Another tour operator, Ray Daley, executive vice president of Apple Vacations East of Newtown Square, Pa., said he expected increases of $60 to $80 a couple for four-night packages from the East Coast in the fall. Earlier this month, a package that included air fare and accommodations at Excalibur was $710.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Ancient Rock in Crosscurrents of Today","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/us/ancient-rock-in-crosscurrents-of-today.html","abstract":"  On Sundays at St. Thomas the Apostle Church, in a gang-ridden area near downtown, the pews fill up for the Spanish-English Mass at 10:45.

If I do say so myself, to get me to open my purse, they have to be good. For this reason, my lasting memories are of the best of the lot.

The Interstate highway ended as soon as we crossed the Mackinac Bridge, which joins Michigan's two peninsulas -- 300 miles from our destination. We made good time on the two-lane highways that traverse the Upper Peninsula, initially skirting pristine, almost deserted beaches along the northern shore of Lake Michigan, then driving for hours across a stark, forbidding landscape of evergreen forests and small logging towns.\n\n Having reached our motel at Copper Harbor in the evening, we were up early the next day to board the Isle Royale Queen for the four-hour boat ride.

Today her referrals come mainly from the American Management Associates, who published her book \"Business Writing -- Quick and Easy.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"A Unique Resonance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/arts/l-gregorian-chants-a-unique-resonance-212849.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The fact that \"Chant\" has soared to first and fifth places on the classical and pop charts, respectively, clearly owes a great deal to the strategy of Angel's president, Steven Murphy  [ \"A Hit 1,000 Years in the Making,\" May 8 ] .

I was also visited at my hotel by the local police who asked \"Why are you going to Pagan?\" as if I was off to spy on some state secret. Finally inside a temple at Pagan, I was confronted by a lone, young soldier at AK-47 gunpoint. He demanded to see what was inside of my belt pouch.

Comparisons can be useful if they illuminate the obscure or help resolve a problem. But simply likening the events of 1991 and the events of 1994 ignores the complexities of sexual harassment. As the Supreme Court noted just last year, sexual harassment that creates a hostile environment defies \"a mathematically precise test,\" and calls for examining \"all the circumstances\" of a case.    In fact, the differences in the Clinton and Thomas situations teach us more about sexual harassment than do the similarities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"The Pigeons Are Unmoved By the Make-Believe Owls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/nyregion/l-the-pigeons-are-unmoved-by-the-make-believe-owls-289019.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   About those fake owls in St. Vincent Hospital's delightful park on Seventh Avenue (F.Y.I., May 22): The pigeons haven't gotten the word yet that they are supposed to be frightened away; last week they were hopping around the garden in abundance, among the flowers and greenery -- and owls.

Mr. Ginsberg was not then, in his words, \"a big picture taker\": he produced only 30 rolls of film between 1953 and 1963. Explaining why he took the pictures at all, Mr. Ginsberg writes that he simply \"had a sacramental sense of these friends.\" Encouraged and taught by such renowned photographers as Robert Frank and Berenice Abbott, Mr. Ginsberg developed into a gifted pictorial chronicler. Among the most appealing of these photographs (each accompanied by a caption handwritten by the photographer) is the \"heroic portrait\" of Jack Kerouac smoking a cigarette on a fire escape in New York City. Another shot shows Neal Cassady and Natalie Jackson embracing beneath a movie marquee advertising Marlon Brando in \"The Wild One.\" The book also features the now-famous photograph of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and his dog, Whitman, in San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore; portraits of such usual suspects as William Burroughs and Gregory Corso; and several fine, unflinching self-portraits.

The land is provided at virtually no cost to the buyer. The land contribution and the grants make possible prices that are affordable to households earning about $25,000 to $50,000 a year.   In purely private housing development, there are no such subsidies. But with the drop in land prices in recent years, builders can set prices lower (meanwhile hoping market strength will push them up again). Accordingly, they are ready to promote as affordable housing the offerings they plan for the middle-income market.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19940529","headline":"Fugitive Killers Hunted in New York City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/nyregion/fugitive-killers-hunted-in-new-york-city.html","abstract":"  The police searched New York City yesterday for two men, both convicted killers, who escaped from an Orange County psychiatric hospital by taking a hostage at gunpoint and drove to the South Bronx on Friday night, the authorities said.

An American poet and storyteller, Edgar Allan Poe, is also included. But right now the street that has topicality is the one named after the author of \"Middlemarch.\"   The name of George Eliot is also on the letterhead of the Centro Cultural/Arte Contemporaneo, which stands at the intersection of Jorge Eliot (as she is known here) and another European import, Campos Eliseos (Champs-Elysees).

Nearly two weeks' worth of cinematic overload and celebrity drumbeating do not encourage cool thinking, but then that's the whole point. The first step to frenzy is well-orchestrated confusion.    Cannes thrives on that. You arrive here to daily press handouts that do not necessarily intend to shed light.

But, he made clear, he was also talking here about mortality as the theme of his 1988 ballet, \"Ives, Songs.\"   The work was the last by Mr. Robbins for the New York City Ballet, and it had all the resonance of a farewell. In December 1989, Mr. Robbins resigned as the company's co-artistic director, a post he had held with Peter Martins since 1983. In the spring of 1990, the City Ballet honored him with a festival of his ballets.

Mr. Kennedy directed the series from 1990 to 1992 but bailed out last year after a dispute with the new music director, Steven Mercurio. Now everything has changed. Gian Carlo Menotti, who founded the festival in 1977 and directed it through 17 seasons, resigned last fall after years of farcical bickering with the board and the city, and Milton Rhodes, the former director of the American Council for the Arts, took over as general manager. Mr. Mercurio left, and his predecessor, Spiros Argiris, was reinstated as part of a triumvirate of artistic directors.

On Wednesday night at the Knitting Factory, with the reeds player Kazutoki Umezu sitting in, Third Person sounded more like a cohesive band than an improvisatory game. Mr. Umezu, who has played with Third Person several times, responded quickly and humorously to Mr. Cora and Mr. Bennett's musical promptings.

But after decades of struggle, relief is in sight. Last week Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, with representatives of the industry and consumer groups, announced an agreement to pare back the exemption. A detailed bill has not been written yet. But the basic proposal appears to be good for consumers and fair to insurers.   Property and casualty insurers, especially the small companies, argue that they need to share data on claims so they can price products according to the best available information. That is a valid argument -- and Mr. Brooks's plan would preserve the right of insurers to share raw data. But the companies have also used their antitrust exemption to jointly analyze the raw data in order to project future claims losses. These shared projections become the basis for collusively setting prices. That would be a crime in any other industry; Mr. Brooks's bill would also make it, and several other collusive practices, illegal in insurance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"1894:Germany Protests : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/opinion/IHT-1894germany-protests-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"BERLIN - The Imperial German Government has formally protested against the Anglo-Belgian treaty on the ground mainly that the frontiers of the Congo Free State having been fixed by an international convention, they cannot be modified in any way save by in","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"CLINTON CRITICIZED AS TOO AMBITIOUS WITH VACCINE PLAN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/us/clinton-criticized-as-too-ambitious-with-vaccine-plan.html","abstract":"  Members of Congress and makers of drugs say the Clinton Administration has gone far beyond what Congress intended when it passed legislation last year to insure that all children would be vaccinated.

The speakers ranged from the cartoonist Cathy Guisewite to the Presidential adviser David R. Gergen. These excerpts were taken from transcripts provided by the respective universities and colleges. North Carolina Central University, May 14  VERNON E. JORDAN JR. Lawyer   Those students of the 1960's, your mothers and fathers, were in the grip of a powerful idea -- the idea of equality -- whose time they hastened and whose force overcame the tread of mighty armies of racism and segregation. They took that maturing experience to become pioneers themselves, blazing trails in corporate America in government and in the professions. You may think that's ancient history, events that happened before you were born. But the struggle is not over. Yesterday's students began something that today's young people must finish. For despite the tremendous gains that have taken place over the past three decades, too much -- far too much -- remains the same. Discrimination still flourishes, although it is now illegal. . . . You must enter into the serious business of helping black people survive and thrive in the 21st century. Catholic University, May 14  TED KOPPEL Television journalist     Our society finds truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form, truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproach. What Moses brought down from Mount Sinai were not the Ten Suggestions. They are commandments. Are, not were. The sheer brilliance of the Ten Commandments is that they codify in a handful of words acceptable human behavior, not just for then or now, but for all time. . . . The tension between those commandments and our baser instincts provides grist for journalism's daily mill. What a huge, gaping void there would be in our informational flow and in our entertainment without the routine violation of the Fifth through Tenth Commandments. . . . Tell me if this doesn't remind you of something: 'Honor thy mother and father. Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness.' Sounds like a script outline for the story of the Menendez brothers, doesn't it? Juilliard School, May 20  JANE ALEXANDER Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts   This occasion lends itself to speculation, to the bittersweet. The poet Samuel Hazo writes about life's journey in a poem called \"The First and Only Sailing,\" of which I'll quote the last few lines:   Expect nothing,   and anything seems everything.   Expect everything, and anything   seems nothing.   To live   you leave your yesterselves   to drown without a funeral.   You chart a trek where no   one's sailed before.   You rig. You anchor up. You sail.    Your time at Juilliard has been spent learning when to tack or when to open your sails to the wind; it has been filled with hard work and wild ideas, friendship, love, the camaraderie of community. Ithaca College, May 14  JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU Oceanographer   As a culture, we are coming to our senses after a 40- or 50-year bad trip of raping the natural and human environment as if there is no tomorrow. Today, we recognize that current industrial society is literally unsustainable. We admit that trashing the future is bad business. . . . You will inherit a planet that, while remarkably resilient, is unmistakably damaged. But today we have the opportunity to turn society around and point our policies, our technology, our dreams in a more positive direction. State University of New York at Geneseo, May 14  DAVID R. GERGEN   Counselor to President Clinton  People who are willing to get off the sidelines and get into the arena make the difference. Your generation has been dismissed as too cynical, too skeptical, and you have reason. After all, the faith has been broken too many times in the past. There is no guarantee that we as a people will succeed. But if you don't get into the arena, I guarantee you we will fail. Syracuse University  KURT VONNEGUT Novelist   I had a bad uncle named Dan, who said a male can't be a man unless he'd gone to war. But I had a good uncle named Alex, who said, when life was most agreeable -- and it could be just a pitcher of lemonade in the shade -- he would say, \"If this isn't nice, what is?\" . . . Now, if he hadn't said that so regularly, maybe five or six times a month, we might not have paused to notice how rewarding life can be sometimes. Perhaps my good Uncle Alex will live on in some of you members of the Syracuse Class of 1994 if, in the future, you will pause to say out loud every so often, \"If this isn't nice, what is?\" Gettysburg College, May 22  ANDY ROONEY Television commentator    I was thinking -- just as an example of how much the times influence what a person does with his life -- if Abraham Lincoln were alive today, would he be standing here making his Gettysburg Address and saying, \"Four score and seven years ago, our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation . . .\"? Of course not. The nation isn't new any more. He'd have to say, \"Ten score and 18 years ago.\" . . . Lincoln would probably be a relatively obscure lawyer who was turned down for the Supreme Court because he and Mary had a live-in maid for whom they never paid Social Security. Haverford College, May 15  CORNEL WEST Harvard University professor    I have only a brief word for the class of 1994, namely that you are now part of a tradition of rich Quakerism on the one hand, but also of grand but still flawed democratic tradition on the other. I think T. S. Eliot was absolutely right when he wrote in 1919 that tradition is not something you inherit. If you want it, you must obtain it with great labor. It is a perennial process. And it means then that one is going to have to cut radically against the American grain, because it means on the one hand, you are going to have to have a sense of history and understand the present as history. And in my own humble opinion, the major forms of idolatry of our day are the market way of life and the tribal way of life. The Citadel, May 14  SENATOR BOB DOLE    American leadership is still required. And sometimes that leadership will mean that Americans will make the supreme sacrifice.  . . . Is it America's destiny to be the world's policeman? No. There are crimes against humanity and against freedom committed every day in countless countries across the world, and America does not go in, guns blazing, to make it right. Instead we lead by example. . . . If we are to maintain our credibility as an economic and moral influence, then we must deal with our problems, like the deficit and crime. And we must remember and teach the values that made America great -- values like decency, honesty and individual responsibility. Wesleyan University  LOWELL P. WEICKER JR. Governor of Connecticut     A few weeks ago I went to South Africa to attend the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela. An event so sweeping as this was undreamed of even by its most ardent supporters. . . . Decades of legally dehumanizing all races but white were buried under an avalanche of paper ballots. Yet there was not one of us witnessing history in Pretoria, as representatives of the United States, who didn't comprehend that what was ending in South Africa as a matter of law was thriving in our own country as a matter of practice. The long moral finger of outrage that we for so long had pointed at South Africa was now more properly directed at ourselves. University of Michigan, April 30  CATHY GUISEWITE Cartoonist    I graduated with a class committed to open love, open thinking open doors, open everything. . . . Twenty-two years later, the people of my class are getting cash out of a machine, dinner out of a clown's mouth and it isn't even possible to get a human being on the phone at the phone company. In Los Angeles, my only chance of having a meaningful encounter with a person is if I smash into one with my car. . . . You've grown up in a strange time where people seem more bonded by the bad stuff than the good. Where in a lot of communities the main common link between neighbors is that everyone knows someone who's been mugged. Everyone knows someone in rehab. And everyone's been touched by a life that ended way too soon. If you want something to change, you personally have to do something different. You have to take a stand when it isn't convenient. Try something nobody else has tried. Defy your own group. Rebel against yourself. Knock down your walls and get out of your way. University of Southern California, May 6  STEVEN SPIELBERG Film maker    It doesn't matter what path we take, we have to remain curious and fearless. We have to look at the world and question what we see. We have to be unafraid to say no and change what is unacceptable. Each of us has the ability to do this. Each of us has the responsibility to do it. New York University, May 12  JAMES EARL JONES Actor    You are facing new worlds of technology so fast that if they don't throw you into a catatonic fit, they will challenge your imagination just to keep up, and threaten to overwhelm your ability to absorb it. It has been predicted that the social implications of this technology promise to be somewhere between the eruption of a volcano and the discovery of fire. Susquehanna University, May 15  CHAIM POTOK Novelist   You can detach the two lines that form an X and realign them so that they take the shape of a gallows, a crucifix, a plus sign, an equals sign. What will it be, this X Decade? A decade of growing hatreds, hardening separations and Balkan tribalism? A decade of continuing postmodern, American-style lynchings and crucifixions? Or a decade in which we add to the well-being of the country? A decade in which we learn more about the true nature of equality for all Americans? Carnegie-Mellon University, May 17  LAWRENCE ELLISON Software-company executive    Within a decade or so, anyone will be able to view anything from anywhere at anytime. Text, numbers, audio and high-resolution video will all be integrated on your screen. . . . The impact of these innovations will be no less than that of Westinghouse's electric power on demand. They will so profoundly change our world that 20 years from now, scarcely anyone will be able to remember what life was like without them. Boston University, May 22  ROSS PEROT Former Presidential candidate    Financial success and happiness are unrelated. . . . I'm no happier today than I was as a boy in the depression in Texarkana. I was rich then because of my parents. . . . A bell is no bell till you ring it. Don't just sit there and look at the bell, ring it. A song is no song till you sing it. Forget everything I've said so far and listen to these last two lines. This is the most important thing I'll say: Love in your heart isn't put there to stay, love isn't love till you give it away. Johns Hopkins Medical School, May 26  DAVID A. KESSLER Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration   We have known of the dangers of smoking for more than 30 years. But only recently has a picture begun to emerge of the decisions and the research that have been occurring inside the tobacco industry about the hazards of cigarettes. It is time to ask the tough questions. We cannot passively cede to the tobacco industry the right to determine the future health of so many of our children. University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill, May 15  DR. FRANCIS S. COLLINS Director, National Center for Human Genome Research    Dr. Collins, a geneticist, spoke effusively of the enduring nature of love and romance. You could say he was inspired: three weeks earlier, a graduating business administration major, James Vanke, asked Dr. Collins to help him propose to his girlfriend, a classmate. In a letter, he urged the scientist to be \"as cheesy as possible.\"   I encourage each of you to consider these three questions and decisions carefully. What will be your life's work? What are you going to do about faith? And what role will love play in your life? . . . Love should be the center of life, the enduring, glowing fire. And I'm happy to see no evidence currently of it dying out. And if you don't accept that, I would like to present as evidence Exhibit A over here in the business section. I would like to ask James Vanke and Suzanne Woloski to please stand up. Right here, right in the front. O.K., everybody, James and Suzanne have been dating for over a year and as you can see, they are head over heels in love. And so, folks, right here, in front of 30,000 people, we are about to witness a big moment. Suzanne didn't know about this. Suzanne, James wants to know if you will do him the honor of becoming his wife. . . . She said yes. Love conquers all.

Mr. Yamashita, a Japanese pianist who only occasionally works in New York, brought in a band that included Cecil McBee on bass and Pheeroan Aklaff on drums, along with a guest, Joe Lovano on tenor saxophone. Without too much finesse, it muscled its set into activity.   Mr. Yamashita is a limited pianist when performing mainstream jazz; instead, he brings expressionistic ideas to the field. He'd follow a piece's harmony for a bit, then start spinning off clusters, mechanically whirring ideas that in their chromaticism ignored a tune's path. His compositions jumped around quickly, from mood to mood, working around odd melodies and skewed bass lines. They invited experimentation; to follow them closely while improvising would have required too much constraint.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940530","headline":"For 4 Collegial Congressmen, Life Looks a Lot Like College","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/30/nyregion/for-4-collegial-congressmen-life-looks-a-lot-like-college.html","abstract":"  Sam cooks, Dick cleans, George collects the rent and Chuck raids the refrigerator.

Find an effective drug and the virus quickly mutates to sidestep the obstacle. Make a vaccine and the virus changes its coat to become invisible to the immune system's antibodies.    In search of fresh approaches, some molecular biologists say it is a mistake to treat AIDS as if it were caused by an ordinary virus like those of influenza or polio. Instead, they say, AIDS should be seen as a disease of DNA. Since H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, integrates itself into the DNA of the chromosomes, they argue, the methods of gene therapy and molecular biology should be used to attack the virus as it subverts the cell's genetic machinery, almost as if it were a mutant human gene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940531","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/31/us/no-headline-250252.html","abstract":"  Ezra Taft Benson, the president of the Mormon Church since 1985 and a Secretary of Agriculture in the Eisenhower Administration, died yesterday at his home in Salt Lake City.
