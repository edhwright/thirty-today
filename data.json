(St. Martin's, $22.95), an absorbing, panoramic novel set in the waning Wild West days of British Columbia. It's that  good: intricately plotted, meticulously researched and shaded with nuance. In \"Shoot!\" the Canadian poet and novelist George Bowering tells the story of four  young men whose Indian mothers and white fathers earn them the dismissive status of half-breeds. Caught between two cultures that neither understand nor accept them, the boys tumble self-destructively from petty thievery to murder. With page after page of thundering hoofbeats, shoot-outs and blood-red sunsets, Shoot! does the western genre proud. But what truly distinguishes this novel is  Mr. Bowering's unflinching examination of bigotry and intolerance, which seems as relevant to today's world as to that of the 1870's. Steady doses of wit and adventure help his brusque prose recover from occasional didactic detours, and a spiraling narrative structure gives the old-fashioned setting some post-modern flair. If nothing else, discovering the source of its deceptively hee-haw title  is reason enough to tempt plenty of curious readers.

But everything about him was impressive: his intense, charismatic personality, his boundless energy and his superior musical talent. \n\n     Henry Lewis is remembered as the first black music director of a major orchestra, but that label grossly understates his accomplishment. The New Jersey Symphony was a fine but little-known entity outside the state until Mr. Lewis took it over in 1968. Obviously, it was not his ethnic heritage but his talent and exacting leadership that raised the orchestra to prominence.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Appeals Judge Says Colleagues Are Not Being Soft on Criminals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/appeals-judge-says-colleagues-are-not-being-soft-on-criminals.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"JERSEY;Fish Rights: The Final Frontier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/jersey-fish-rights-the-final-frontier.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Having Gotten the Part, Bronfman Plays the Mogul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/business/having-gotten-the-part-bronfman-plays-the-mogul.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"On Cape Verde, Carnival Is Down to Earth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/travel/on-cape-verde-carnival-is-down-to-earth.html","abstract":"COME Carnival time, news broadcasts around the globe show a whirl of crowds and floats and bikinis and beads.

A brilliant colorist whose work is often seen as falling somewhere  between representation and abstraction, Mr. Hodgkin \"does not allow illustration to interfere with the making of a painting,\" Mr. Auping writes. \"Memory and metaphor are his preferred terrain.\" Mr. Auping finds that Mr. Hodgkin's paintings of the last two decades have forged the unlikely pairing of Intimism and Expressionism from wildly diverse influences like Henri Matisse, douard Vuillard, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning. Or as the cultural critic Susan Sontag puts it in her illuminating meditation: \"Hodgkin has understood that if the pictures are dense enough, they can go in two directions, doing justice to intimate textures as well as to emotions of a large expressiveness. (Both Vuillard and opera, so to speak.)\" Along with 80 color illustrations are an erudite and informative epistolary exchange between Mr. Hodgkin and John Elderfield, the chief curator at large at the Museum of Modern Art, and the first catalogue raisonn of Mr. Hodgkin's oil paintings, compiled by Marla Price, the director of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.

Since then, our income tax system has consistently raised the revenue needed to meet the Government's spending decisions. Through two world wars and a worldwide Depression, the income tax system has proven capable, flexible and dependable. \n\n     But today a national debate rages over whether we should retain this system or return to a consumption-based tax system.

Because roots function mostly out of sight, gardeners have conjured up some pretty fanciful assumptions about how they grow. Such misconceptions permeate gardening behavior and have distorted how almost every shade tree and fruit tree in America is watered, mulched and fertilized. Here are some common myths about root growth: \n\n  MYTH NO. 1: TREE ROOTS ARE AS WIDE AS THE CANOPY.  This old adage is as widespread as it is wrong. In heavy clay soils, which have little air and offer  a lot of resistance to root hairs, tree roots may grow only half again as wide as the canopy, but well beyond its canopy's edge, also called the \"dripline.\" In sandy soils, which offer less physical resistance, roots will often grow up to three times as wide. In a shallow soil on top of a clay or hardpan layer, the roots may wander out to an area five times as wide as the canopy in search of moisture and nutrients.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Archives"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Making Records Far From the Urban
