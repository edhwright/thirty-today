The 1983 law that prohibited food vending on more than 100 streets was rarely enforced until Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pressed the police last spring to do so. If the crackdown thrilled restaurant owners, it infuriated the vendors and every New Yorker accustomed to picking up a cheap, al fresco lunch.

In fact, the music demands equal attention with Jean Cocteau's classic film, which is stripped of its soundtrack and projected on a screen behind the seven players of the Philip Glass Ensemble and the four singers. The soloists sing precisely the same words the original actors spoke, but the lip-synching never quite works and it never quite matters. Individual words simply do not make that much difference in this score.

It's a musical attic where she dusts off curios -- standards, hymns, country songs, backwoods blues, bits of rock -- and displays them or reassembles them to suit her own quirks. Her songs are gently off-center, following free-associative paths to find small epiphanies.

Its activities were meant to aid the peace process between the Hutu-dominated Rwandese government and the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The UNAMIR has received much attention for its role in failing, due to the limitations of its rules of engagement, to prevent the Rwandan genocide and outbreak of fighting. Its mandate extended past the RPF overthrow of the government and into the Great Lakes refugee crisis. The mission is thus regarded as a major failure."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19941210","time":"1994-12-10

Hapgood is brainy: she plays chess without a board. She runs a tight office. She's good at her job, but she's also a hopeless romantic, having had a son by Kerner (David Strathairn), the Russian spy she turned into a double agent. She doesn't hesitate to use her 10 Downing Street hot line to make private telephone calls elsewhere. On a secret mission overseas, she sends home cheery, wish-you-were-here picture postcards.

SAMPLE QUESTION: The twisted shape of the pretzel was derived from: (a) arms folded in prayer, (b) people seated cross-legged, (c) the Boy Scouts' slip knot. Risk question: A pretzel is displayed on the emblem of what group of tradesmen? (Answers: (a), bakers.) AVAILABLE: At specialty stores, like F. A. O. Schwarz, Learningsmith and the Museum Company, and through the Worldwide Games catalogue, (800) 243-9232. Suggested price is $36. WHAT: CAREY DeVUONO'S HOLLYWOOD MOGUL . EQUIPMENT NEEDED: An I.B.M.-compatible computer and Windows 3.1. IDEAL PLAYER: Hard-hearted, with a head for negotiation, and tall enough to reach the mouse. HOW TO PLAY: You are the owner of a studio and make all the decisions to produce your own movies, from choosing the script and hiring stars to budgeting the production and the release of the films. If a movie loses money, the game moves to the natural next step: choosing whom to blame. One option is to fire everybody. EDUCATIONAL? Sure. The instruction book explains the lingo of \"players,\" like above-the-line costs and P & A. You don't go to a meeting, you take a meeting. Got it, babe? RAISON D'ETRE: A struggling screenwriter, Carey DeVuono, wanted to prove that his screenplay, \"The Highland Street Generals,\" would be a hit. He taught himself to program and created Hollywood Mogul. \"The Highland Street Generals\" is one of the scripts available in the game, but outside Hollywood Mogul, it has yet to be sold. AVAILABLE: Only by mail, for $39.99. Telephone: (800) 350-5550. WHAT: THE DOONESBURY GAME.  IDEAL PLAYER: Opinionated and makes sure everyone knows it. Likes parlor games to show off a mocking wit. Can talk about any subject without knowing anything about it. HOW TO PLAY: Land on squares with categories like Public Opinion, Flashback and Soundbites. Pick a card, which supplies a topic for that category. Depending on the category, a player gives a presentation or tells a story from his own life relating to the topic, and the other players judge the performance. Or a player writes down words in response to the topic, while other players write their responses and try to match his words. Points are scored. Sarcasm ensues. SAMPLE TOPICS: \"John Kennedy Jr. dials you by mistake. Keep him on the line.\" \"Talk about a rock group you saw before they were who they became.\" WHAT THIS GAME HAS TO DO WITH DOONESBURY: Not much, except for capturing the comic strip's satiric baby-boomer sensibility. Reading the Garry Trudeau strip is not a requirement, although some board spaces make more sense with some background. For example, landing on Boopsie's Channel Change makes players switch places, identities and points. AVAILABLE: At specialty stores and through the Worldwide Games catalogue for $32. WHAT: MANCALA .  ORIGINS: Commonly believed to be 3,000 years old, the game is thought to have originated in Egypt, and it is played throughout Africa, with regional variations. IDEAL PLAYER: Any age; enjoys strategy games. HOW TO PLAY: Two players face each other across a wooden board. Colored stones are distributed equally in the 12 shallow bowls carved into the board; the two larger bowls (the mancala) on either end are empty. Each player in turn distributes his stones among the six bowls on his side. There are many variations to the game, but in the most common set of rules, each time a stone is placed in an empty bowl, the player captures the stones from the opposite bowl and places them in his mancala. The object of the game is to capture the most stones. THE APPEAL: Like backgammon or chess, the complexity of the game depends on the skill of the players, so all ages can play. And it looks nice on the coffee table: the woods used for the board include pine and oak, and some versions use semiprecious stones. AVAILABLE: Widely available from many different manufacturers. Prices range from $10.95 to $26.

When the 18th-century English poet George Crabbe wrote \"The Borough,\" a psychologically acute portrait of a Suffolk fishing village, he took several characters from real life, and among his subjects was a savage-tempered fisherman whose boy apprentices had been found dead under mysterious circumstances. Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears came across a collection of Crabbe poems in a Los Angeles bookshop in 1941; they were spellbound by the lurid tale of Grimes and began planning an opera on the subject.   Nearly 50 years after its first performance, by the Sadler's Wells Opera Company, Britten's \"Peter Grimes\" has lost none of its luster and force. The work returns to the Metropolitan Opera in the 1967 production by Tyrone Guthrie on Monday evening. It has been gone for 10 years, and 10 years is surely far too long. This is one of the supreme 20th-century operas, perhaps the greatest opera ever written in English. Not only does the music still have a tremendous impact, but the story and principal character exercise an endless, insatiable fascination. Who was Grimes? What was his crime?

Today, the hard-edged style and many of the artists it attracted remain overshadowed by Abstract Expressionism, which definitively put American art on the international map in the early 1950's. But in the late 1920's and early 1930's, when modern machines and architecture held the promise of a bright, streamlined future, Precisionism seemed like an art movement whose time had come and a sure sign of American art's international stature.    As Gail Stavitsky notes in the catalogue to \"Precisionism in America 1915-1941: Reordering Reality,\" at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey, its arrival was predicted by no less a cultural commentator than Lewis Mumford. And it was repeatedly welcomed by art critics in search of a new esthetic commensurate with America's booming industrial prowess. Alfred H. Barr Jr., director of the Museum of Modern Art, saw its chief practitioners -- Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, Georgia O'Keeffe, Preston Dickinson and Niles Spencer -- as part of an international tendency that he called the New Objectivity. The machine esthetic also attracted poets like William Carlos Williams, who became the subject of the painting that may be the style's greatest, and maybe only, masterpiece.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941211","headline":"Crime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/books/crime-973033.html","abstract":"  Forget about English country houses -- there is no more insular setting for a mystery than an Israeli kibbutz. Inspector Michael Ohayon, the reflective detective who puzzles out Batya Gur's intellectually challenging mysteries, feels the waves of suspicion and hostility in MURDER ON A KIBBUTZ (HarperCollins, $20) when he invades one of these closed societies to investigate the death of its administrative secretary. \"You're wasting your time,\" one elder says dismissively. \"It's impossible to understand from the outside.\"   As far as the murder mystery goes, that's not true. There are some obvious suspects in the poisoning death of Osnat Harel, whose progressive views about letting children sleep in their parents' homes and setting up separate quarters for the elderly sowed a great deal of dissension in this very old, very traditional commune. But the deeper mysteries of how life is lived on a kibbutz do, indeed, seem almost impenetrable to an outsider. Which is why Ms. Gur, speaking through Dalya Bilu's lucid translation from the Hebrew, can grab her readers with dry discussions of \"egalitarian elitism\" and fussy deliberations over who picks the peaches and who cuts the dress patterns -- seemingly simple housekeeping matters that actually reflect earthshaking political and ideological changes transforming kibbutz society.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941211","headline":"Little Boxes, All Decked Out And Ready to Play","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/arts/pop-music-little-boxes-all-decked-out-and-ready-to-play-059498.html","abstract":"  Boxed sets have become an annual holiday ritual for fans and record companies alike.

Unlike a lot of visitors, his is a size 18 neck. \"Those buildings seem to go into the sky,\" he said. Another unusual circumstance was that while he looked at the city with wide eyes, some of the city looked back at him in quite the same way.   He was one of a group of husky fellows that, as part of a tour of the city, took the Staten Island ferry on a gray morning yesterday. Other passengers noted them because they were being followed by another group of television and still photographers, and reporters.   \"Who are you?\" asked a young man with a baseball cap, with typical New Yorker diffidence.   \"Steve McNair,\" he replied, softly and, perhaps, warily.   \"You the quarterback from that small school in the South?\"   \"Alcorn State,\" said McNair.   \"Hey, you had some year, guy!\" He turned to his friend. \"This guy was outrageous. He's got unbelievable stats!\"   McNair, who has set several Division I and Division I-AA records in passing and total yardage, was in town along with five other college football players who were considered the top candidates for the Heisman Trophy, emblematic of the best college football player in the land.   Each of the other candidates were from Division I-A schools: Ki-Jana Carter, the running back, and Kerry Collins, the quarterback, both from Penn State; Rashaan Salaam, running back, Colorado; Jay Barker, quarterback, Alabama, and Warren Sapp, defensive lineman, Miami.   The winner was Salaam, who had rushed for 2,055 yards this past season. McNair was third, with 111 first-place votes, tying him for the highest finish for a Division I-AA player in Heisman history. Gordie Lockbaum, the two-way player from Holy Cross, finished third in 1987, and Neil Lomax, a Portland State quarterback, finished seventh in 1980.   \"I think that with the numbers I put up, that should erase questions about the level of competition,\" said the 6-foot-2-inch, 220-pound McNair. \"While the other players had butted heads against some of the best teams in the country on a week-to-week basis, McNair's Southwestern Athletic Conference -- the Gramblings, Southerns and Mississippi Valley States -- while competitive, could hardly be classed with the Michigans and Notre Dames.   The other players on the trip to visit young patients at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island -- were generous, if not in fact diplomatic, in their comments about McNair.   \"I don't think that his level of competition should take anything away from how he should be considered as a football player,\" said Collins. \"I saw film clips of him. He's a great talent.\"   Said Salaam: \"He's got a nice size and a nice shape, and what he did he did on a college level -- it wasn't like junior college. And I've talked to coaches about him. They tell me he's legit.\"   McNair had opted for Alcorn State because when he was a star high school quarterback out of Mount Olive, Miss., the Division I schools interested him -- Miami, Mississippi State, Notre Dame and Florida, among others -- wanted him to play defensive back. \"Alcorn State was the only one that wanted me as a quarterback,\" he said.   Before learning he had lost, he said, he was happy to be in the running for the Heisman.   \"After this,\" he said, \"I'm going back to school and get my degree in May.\" He will earn a bachelor's in recreation. \"And then I'll see what I can do in the next level.\" Which means the National Football League.   Pro scouts have talked with him and, he says, they have informed him that he has \"the total package\" to be an N.F.L. quarterback. \"They said they like my size, my arm strength, my stamina, my ability to elude the rush.\"   Was he concerned that as a black quarterback he had special hurdles in the N.F.L.? \"Twenty years ago I might have said yes, but not today,\" he said. \"The N.F.L. wants great players. They don't care if they're black or white.\"   As for Charlie Ward, last year's Heisman winner who was not drafted by a single N.F.L. team but wound up as a basketball player with the Knicks, McNair said, \"The way I understand it, the N.F.L. wanted a firm commitment that he would play football and not basketball, and he didn't give it to them.\"   On Friday night in New York, McNair and the other Heisman candidates saw the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building and stopped off at the Hard Rock Cafe.   \"It's amazing,\" McNair said. \"There are more people out in the nighttime than in the daytime.\" He admitted it was nothing like his hometown or Lorman, Miss., where Alcorn State is located.   And while he has enjoyed much of what he saw, he still misses certain elements of home, like Mary's, a hangout in Lorman, where they serve his favorite dish, the pork chop platter.   When he entered Alcorn State, he only had a size 17 neck. What was more responsible for his adding an inch to his neck, a weight program or the pork chop platter?   \"Both,\" he said, with a convincing smile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941211","headline":"Little Boxes, All Decked Out And Ready to Play","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/arts/pop-music-little-boxes-all-decked-out-and-ready-to-play-059510.html","abstract":"  Boxed sets have become an annual holiday ritual for fans and record companies alike.

This is a hard act to keep going nowadays. Traditional recipes are being rediscovered all over Italy, yes, but they are being rehabilitated, too. Extra-virgin oil has replaced lard, and pesante (heavy) is the worst name you can call a food.    So where does this leave Bologna the Fat (the city's best-known epithet), which has waddled its way into gastronomic history with the plumpest sausage, the richest meat sauce and the heftiest repertory of stuffed pastas on the entire peninsula? The answer seems to be: a bit out of favor but still setting standards for foods and ingredients that Italians will never give up entirely. On a recent weekend trying restaurants in Bologna's medieval center, we aimed first to sample the most famous traditional dishes at the source, but also to explore something of the alternatives. Ristorante Diana    It is generally agreed that if you can't wangle an invitation to someone's house, this is the place to taste the classic dishes. We joined about 150 hungry Bolognesi and a few assorted foreigners for lunch on a rainy Sunday to do just that. The restaurant's two large rooms were closely packed, and the cloakroom perilously close to the trays leaving the adjacent kitchen at high speed. Bustling doesn't even begin to describe the atmosphere, but hectic would be unfair.   The menu has two parts: traditional dishes and daily specials. The latter included some seasonal offerings (funghi porcini), but also a great deal of what seemed designed to provide a little relief to family members accompanying conservative older relatives. For example, strozzapreti, a regional pasta, with salmon -- not traditional, and, until the last few years, not even Italian. The traditional menu is short -- the Bolognese repertory is dense, not extensive, and stronger in the primi piatti, or first courses, than in meats and vegetables.   Our surprisingly delicious appetizer of spuma di mortadella was decidedly not the usual bologna. It was a pate made of mortadella sausage, the true bologna, and served with dainty white toast. We sampled lasagne verdi (my favorite food on earth), tagliatelle with ragu (the authentic, and only, Bolognese meat sauce) and the lighter but no less traditional passatelli in brodo, short, fat strings of a paste of bread crumbs, Parmesan and nutmeg cooked in broth. All were worthy specimens, the lasagne juicy and tender, with a ragu-bechamel ratio distinctly in favor of the meat sauce. Our main courses were served generously from a trolley, one for bollito misto, the other for roasts.   Desserts included excellent homemade ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and a very nice torta di riso (a slice of dense, not overly sweet rice cake). Our wine was Sangiovese, a local red, chosen from the limited list. Pappagallo    As a graduate student in the early 1970's, I discovered early on that some of the best restaurants in Italy were conveniently situated near important archeological museums. And so it was that I had an excuse for a pilgrimage to this restaurant, justifiably considered to offer the finest cuisine in the queen city of food. But soon after, a series of changes in management and reputed decline began, and I did not go back until recently, when a Bolognese friend convinced me that it was time to try it again.   The restaurant is in the same beautiful place, a medieval building on a small, historic piazza, and the parrot (pappagallo) on the sign is the same. Inside, however, the rather cold results of a 1980's renovation -- higher ceilings, brighter lighting -- have forever done away with the happy coziness that tempered Pappagallo's elegance. In addition to a bar, there are two spacious dining rooms, one hung with rows of showbiz photographs, in which we recognized no one. What we found was good food in an attractive restaurant, but the little extra touches in both ambiance and cuisine that might have brought back the former greatness were largely missing.   The menu is varied: In addition to the (not exhaustive) list of classics, there is fish as well as other modern, low-calorie offerings (smoked swordfish, veal fillets with capers and balsamic vinegar). But on our first evening in Bologna we wanted tortellini in brodo and lasagne verdi, which the waiter divided into half-portions so we could share with dignity. (Tortellini, small meat-stuffed rings of pasta, are properly served only in broth; practically an object of cult worship to some people, they are eaten all over Italy on Christmas day.) We gave both dishes high marks, but they turned out not to be the best we tasted in Bologna.    My companion then tackled a satisfying fritto misto al Pappagallo. Despite the proprietary name, this was pretty much what is called fritto misto all'italiana everywhere else, a local standby consisting of deep-fried vegetables, including a small mountain of julienne-sliced zucchini, and a small amount of meat, as well as some sweet pieces -- chunks of fruit and custard. My filetto di tacchino (breast of turkey with prosciutto and cheese) was good but heavy (that word), and its garnish of out-of-season peas was a touch of so-called international cuisine we could have done without. Again, we chose the local Sangiovese wine, but this time from a more extensive list.   I'd advise skipping the unexciting antipasti to leave room for the desserts. We loved the crema liquida con biscottini -- liquid custard with little cookies -- and sorbetto (more of a slush) of lemon and vodka.  Trattoria da Gianni    This archetypal trattoria makes no attempt to provide lighter alternatives, and to judge by the happy faces of the many local patrons who fill it, nobody cares. Neither did we; we loved it. Even the musician who came in off the street was delightful -- a young woman who played Renaissance and Baroque music on, respectively, tenor and alto recorders.   We began with a voluptuous slice of polenta dripping with melted squacquerone, a very soft, very fresh white cheese, and then tried two of the same dishes we'd had at Pappagallo -- tortellini in brodo and fritto misto all'italiana -- giving them rather higher marks. The tortellini were more succulent, the fritto misto more exciting (and slightly larger -- we shared it), with even more components, such as tiny deep-fried skewers (on toothpicks) of fresh ham and also a chunk of brains (a canonical ingredient). We also tried the inspired tortelli (large, square ravioli) stuffed with a chestnut puree and sauced with butter, transparent little rings of leek and lots of Parmesan -- which the chef, Loredana Brusori, grated exuberantly directly onto the plate and everything else in sight. Many of the other diners were tucking into the bollito misto, and the offerings also included a slab of baked ham and lepre (hare) alla cacciatora.    Only the desserts were disappointing. We chose what seemed the most unusual option, apple souffle (not made to order), but its crown of several inches of meringue was rubbery. We should probably have stuck with homemade creme caramel. We never saw a wine list -- the choice seemed to be Sangiovese or Lambrusco, the region's other famous red, lighter and slightly sparkling. We took the Lambrusco. Torre de' Galluzzi    The most interesting meal of our weekend, in the most beautiful setting, was here, in a 13th-century tower that belonged to one of the medieval city's great families, but now is the least typically Bolognese of the restaurants we tried. The ambiance is elegant but not forbidding. The main dining room, dominated by a magnificent fireplace, is large, and there are two attractive private rooms. The eclectic choices include tasting menus: vegetarian, traditional (but not overwhelmingly), fish and fiorentina alla Toscana (the celebrated Tuscan steak). Since we were accompanied by our local friends without whom we would never have discovered this gem, we ordered a la carte and shared.    All the dishes used fresh, subtly flavored ingredients, skillfully handled and light, until we reached dessert. From the fish menu we sampled steamed cannocchie (mantis shrimp), green ravioli stuffed with scorfano (scorpion fish), scampi (langoustines) with julienne artichokes, and turbot filets in a tart lemon sauce. Vegetarian choices included an exceptional zuppa di farro (spelt), orecchiette con cime di rapa (a quintessentially Puglian pasta, reflecting the owner-chef's origins) and a marvelous main dish of simply grilled vegetables and cheese. Ravioli stuffed with potato (yes!) with a light sauce of tomato, sausage and diced eggplant came from the traditional menu, while scaloppine of calf liver with pine nuts and raisins was unclassified. Our Bolognese friend, who has written a book on matching foods with the right wine, chose a white Sardinian Vermentino from the excellent list.   The splendid desserts included a grape tart with lemon gelato, an individual carrot cake, an exciting apple mille foglie (millefeuille) with Calvados, and a crepe filled with melted taleggio cheese and sliced pears, drenched in Marsala sauce, about which I am still having unseemly dreams. Osteria del Sole    Fat is not Bologna's only epithet. The city is also called the Learned and the Red (for both its politics and its buildings), and this tiny wine shop, founded in 1468 and practically unchanged since, is a favorite haunt of underfed leftist intellectuals from the even older University of Bologna. They are kept company by wine enthusiasts of various girths and credos, with or without academic credentials. The Fat does not apply since the only food consumed is from the patrons' own brown bags at centuries-old communal wooden tables. Seriously, since it is physically impossible to eat more than one Bolognese meal a day, a place to go at noon and evening to observe a very typical local scene in a historic setting -- but not eat -- is a useful thing to know. But if you're feeling hungry, there are a number of hedonistic food shops within a stone's throw where you can buy prepared dishes or cold cuts to carry in and eat with the glass or bottle of fine wine or even Champagne that you have ordered at the Osteria. WHAT IT COSTS    Prices are for full meals for two with a moderately priced bottle of wine, calculated at a rate of 1,500 lire to the dollar.

In some cases, the detective work was surprisingly elementary. In 1928, Mississippi John Hurt recorded a song called \"Avalon Blues\"; 35 years later, he was found in Avalon, Miss.

Luscious. Scrumptious. These are just a few of the adjectives that appropriately describe the paintings in HOWARD HODGKIN (Abrams, $49.50). Andrew Graham-Dixon, the chief art critic at the London newspaper The Independent, argues that while Hodgkin's work cannot be limited to one school of painting, if it falls within any tradition at all it is that of the Intimists -- Matisse, Bonnard, Vuillard -- \"only insofar as his concern has always been with the articulation in paint of moments of thought or feeling.\" Or as the 62-year-old Hodgkin, who was knighted in 1992, puts it himself: \"I paint representational pictures of emotional situations.\" Hodgkin's art has been slow to evolve. It was not until the mid-1970's, Mr. Graham-Dixon believes, that the painter's work reached its potential. Most of the paintings from the 1980's on are rendered in vivid, evanescent oils on wood and frame, with the frame becoming inseparable from the painting itself. \"Howard Hodgkin\" is that rare but sublime match of author and subject, paintings and text. Indeed, Mr. Graham-Dixon's erudite and endlessly quotable study is a profound meditation not only on this particular artist's work and career, but on the nature of art itself.\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941211","headline":"Court Allows Holding of Patients Who Are Dangerous Only if Free","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/nyregion/court-allows-holding-of-patients-who-are-dangerous-only-if-free.html","abstract":"  A state appeals court in Manhattan has ruled that a hospitalized mental patient who is on medication and is currently not dangerous can still be confined against his will if that patient is very likely to abandon his medication and revert to dangerous behavior on drugs and alcohol.
