Stricker, whose starting time was backed up by two rain delays totaling 1 hour 41 minutes, had two holes to go when play was suspended on the Glen Abbey Golf Club course at 7:45 P.M. The 26-year-old Stricker, a native of Edgerton, Wis., who plays most of his golf on the Canadian tour, was eight under for the tournament when play was stopped. Brad Bryant, not yet a winner in his 16-year PGA Tour career, held the clubhouse lead at six-under 138 after a hard-fought 70 in a cold rain. There was plenty of bad weather as winds gusted to 45 miles an hour. In addition to the heavy rains that stopped play twice, intermittent showers fell most of the day and temperatures never got out of the 50's. Brandel Chamblee, Dudley Hart and Phil Blackmar were at 140.    Three Share Lead: Despite bogeys on three of her last five holes, Tina Barrett shared the lead with Michelle Mackall and Brandie Burton at six-under-par 66 after the first round of the Ping-Cellular One Golf Championship in Portland, Ore. Barrett had nine birdies in her round and was eight-under through 13 holes in the $450,000 event. \"It was almost a little bit scary,\" the 26-year-old Barrett said. \"Everything was just going really close to the hole for a while there. Through 13 holes, it was unbelievable.

Forceful, blunt and articulate, she is well equipped to make that post the bully pulpit it can and should be. Provided, that is, that Dr. Elders's penchant for the quotable quote -- her remarks about the \"celibate, male-dominated\" Roman Catholic Church, for instance, and about kids being taught \"what to do in the front seat of the car but not what to do in the back seat\" -- does not distract Americans from her message.   Dr. Elders's message is simple: that Americans must face the daunting facts of adolescent life. Of the 56 million Americans with sexually transmitted diseases, for instance, nearly 17 percent are teen-agers. Teen-agers also account for more than 350,000 abortions every year, and the teen-age birth rate, which dropped steadily through the 70's and early 80's, started rising again in 1986 and is still rising. The figures are, on the whole, hardly surprising, given that more than half of America's adolescents have embarked on sexual intercourse by 17.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930911","headline":"Fraud Issue Is Raised In Loan to Holtzman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/11/us/fraud-issue-is-raised-in-loan-to-holtzman.html","abstract":"  City investigators looking into New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman's receipt of a 1992 campaign loan from the Fleet Bank have referred a possible bank fraud case to the Manhattan United States Attorney, a source familiar with their report said early today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930911","headline":"So How About the Braves as Neighbors?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/11/sports/baseball-so-how-about-the-braves-as-neighbors.html","abstract":"  The state of the game has been altered.

East    Duke (0-1) vs. Rutgers (1-0) at Giants Stadium. DNP. A defining evening for the Scarlet Knights. Veteran Blue Devil team absorbed a 45-7 loss to Florida State.   Southern California (1-1) at Penn State (1-0) DNP. Trojans trounced Houston after being trounced by North Carolina. Nittany Lions gave up 478 yards passing to Minnesota, a Beaver Stadium record.    Virginia Tech (1-0) at Pittsburgh (1-0) DNP. Big East rivals have never played before. Tech has creditable quarterback in Maurice DeShazo.   Lehigh (0-1) at Fordham (0-0) 16-14. Engineers surrendered 62 points and 609 yards to Delaware. Rams are unknown quantities; likely no world beaters.    Hofstra (1-0) at Rhode Island (0-1) 28-18. Flying Dutchmen continue run-and-shoot attack, good for 337 passing yards against Butler. Rhodies lost opener, 31-10, to Boise State under new coach, Floyd Keith.    Holy Cross (0-0) at Massachusetts (0-0) 3-7. Minutemen's victory last year ended Crusaders' 26-game unbeaten streak at home.    William and Mary (1-0) at Delaware (1-0) DNP. Key match in newly expanded Yankee Conference.    New Hampshire (0-1) at Connecticut (0-1) 21-24. Neither was imposing in opening defeats, Wildcats to William and Mary, 27-14; Huskies to Furman, 26-17. Midwest   Notre Dame (1-0) at Michigan (1-0) 17-17. If underdog Irish can win this one, then Coach Lou Holtz will have several last laughs.    Washington (1-0) at Ohio State (1-0) DNP. Huskies on a mission of redemption. Buckeyes had satisfying 34-7 opening victory over Rice and won't be easy.   Texas A&M (1-0) at Oklahoma (1-0) DNP. First meeting since 1951. Aggies, with mild schedule, will not often be tested like this. Sooners were formidable in 35-3 rout of T.C.U.    Iowa (1-0) at Iowa State (1-0) 21-7. Hawkeyes usually win but maybe not this time. South    Clemson (1-0) at Florida State (2-0) 20-24. Tigers were unimpressive in 10-point triumph over Nevada-Las Vegas. The Seminoles seem awesome.    Georgia (0-1) at Tennessee (1-0) 31-34. Two of nation's best quarterbacks on display. But Vols' Heath Shuler has stronger cast than Bulldogs' Eric Zeier.    Maryland (0-1) at North Carolina (2-0) 24-31. Tar Heels imposing so far. Terps seldom score faster or more often than their foes.    Alabama (1-0) at Vanderbilt (1-0) 25-8. Commodores, who rushed for 431 yards against Wake Forest, may dent the resolute Bama defense. But not enough.    Florida (1-0) at Kentucky (1-0) 35-19. Gators broke in an impressive new quarterback, Terry Dean. They merit everyone's attention.  West    San Diego State (1-0) at California (1-0) DNP. Marshall Faulk may have trouble running through the Golden Bears. Mismatches    Colgate (0-1) at Army (0-0) DNP. Cadets will show a more diversified offense in this rehearsal.    Navy (0-0) at Virginia (1-0) 0-53. The Middies will be stronger this season but won't come close to Cavaliers.    Texas Tech (1-0) at Nebraska (1-0) DNP.

UNIVERSAL COVERAGE   A range of services would be covered, including hospital care, emergency services, doctors and other health professionals, pregnancy-related services, hospice and home health care, ambulances, outpatient laboratory tests and prescription drugs. The Administration describes the coverage as equal to that offered by the nation's largest companies.    A new long-term care program would be created for disabled people that would provide expanded home care services.    Coverage of dental, eye and mental health care would be initially limited, but be expanded in the year 2000. Items considered not medically necessary, like cosmetic surgery, would not be covered.   Free preventive care, including periodic medical exams, immunizations and screening procedures like mammograms, pap smears and readings of cholesterol levels would be provided in accordance with a schedule set by the Government.    A Medicare benefit for prescription drugs would be created. Beneficiaries would pay 25 percent of the program through their Part B premium, a $250 deductible and 20 percent of the costs beyond that to an annual maximum of $1,000.    A choice would be offered between enrollment in a traditional fee-for-service plan, a health maintenance organization or a plan that combines elements of each.   Employers would be allowed to provide benefits that are more generous than the standard package, although after the year 2000 the extra benefits would be treated as taxable income for employees.    Illegal immigrants would not be covered, although they would continue to be eligible for emergency and other services; institutions that serve many uncovered patients would continue to receive Federal reimbursement. HOW IT WOULD WORK    Most Americans would be enrolled in regional entities called health alliances, which would negotiate the price of coverage with health plans, offer a range of plans to members and collect premiums from employers and individuals.    States would insure that alliances exist in areas where coverage would otherwise be insufficient.    Companies with more than 5,000 employees would have the option of providing care to their workers by creating a corporate alliance and contracting directly with a health-care provider.    People now enrolled in Medicare would continue in that program, but could later join the regional alliances. States would have the option of integrating Medicare recipients into their alliances so long as their coverage is as good or better.    Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in regional alliances and receive the standared package of benefits, as well as supplementary services.    All Americans would be issued a national health identification card that would guarantee them access to needed services. WHO WOULD PAY    The average premium for the standard package would be $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families. Businesses would be required to pay 80 percent of the average premium. Families and individuals would pay the difference between that amount and the full cost of the plan they select, meaning that those enrolled in cheaper plans would pay less, or more for plans more expensive than the average. Employers would have the option of paying more than 80 percent. The plan also suggests that a worker would be able to buy an average health policy for just $360 a year and a family policy for $840. The employer would pay four times that much.    No business in a regional alliance would have to pay more than 7.9 percent of its payroll. Companies with fewer than 50 employees and those with many low-wage workers would be eligible for Government subsidies and for caps ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll, depending on their average wages.    Families and individuals could pay their share of the premium directly or through withholding; alliances may require withholding to avoid bad debt.    The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount of the premium, unless they were eligible for assistance based on income.    Retired workers under 65 would be responsible for 20 percent of the premium.    Employers would pay for part-time workers on a pro-rated basis.   Out-of-pocket costs would depend on the kind of service chosen. Alliances would be required to offer high-cost, low-cost and combination plans. The terms appear to refer respectively to traditional fee-for-service coverage, HMO's, and preferred provider networks.    A high-cost plan would allow the use of any doctor but calls for deductibles of $200 an individual and $400 a family and 20 percent co-payment after that.    In a low cost plan, the patient would see only doctors approved by the plan, but pay no deductible besides a $10-a-visit fee for outpatient services.    In the combination plan, the patient would agree to pay 20 percent of the cost whenever using a doctor outside the plan.    Out-of-pocket expenses are capped annually at $1,500 for each person and $3,000 for a family under all three plans. CONTROLLING COSTS    A National Health Board would be created to oversee the system and set a national health budget with the goal of limiting the rate of increase of health care spending to that of the general rate of inflation by 1999. Health care expenses are now growing at more than twice the inflation rate.    If the competitive process does not reduce growth to that level, the board would impose mandatory limits on the growth of annual premiums, forcing health plans to spend less.    Upon introducing the plan, the President would urge all sectors of the health care industry to limit price and spending increases to a specific amount not yet disclosed. Prices and spending would be monitored by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    The National Health Board would make public declarations about the costs of new drugs and could investigate the costs of existing drugs it considers overpriced. It would have no authority to set drug prices.    The rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid would be reduced. WORKERS COMPENSATION    The separate insurance systems that now exist to cover the costs of injuries suffered at work or in automobile accidents would be continued. But the care would be provided through the health alliances created under the plan through contracts between them and the insurers. TAKING EFFECT    States could begin implementing the system by Jan. 1, 1995, and would be required to have it in place by Jan. 1, 1997.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930911","headline":"MIDEAST ACCORD: History; Years of Bloodletting Scar Israeli-P.L.O.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, mass immunization programs have broken down, allowing once nearly eradicated diseases to re-emerge. Moreover, many Russians have been avoiding immunizations because of a lack of trust in doctors and fear of contracting H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through contaminated needles.    Russia's diphtheria epidemic is the most serious health concern, with more than 4,000 people reported to have been infected this year. Diphtheria is transmitted by airborne bacteria and can cause rapid death. Concern among Westerners rose sharply after the first foreigner, a 62-year-old Belgian woman, contracted diphtheria here and died Aug. 18. One of Britain's largest travel companies, Thomson Holidays, announced last month that it was suspending its tours to Russia because of the diphtheria scare.

Visionary. Complex. Overreaching. Those are just a few of the adjectives that leap to mind when plowing through President Clinton's 250-page health care plan that was leaked to the press by members of Congress a week before the President was to unveil its contents. There will be plenty of time over the next few weeks to scrutinize the details. But this is the moment to savor the noble ambitions of this plan and to ponder the politics and history of the moment.   The Administration's overriding goal is that no American will ever go to bed at night fearing that medical catastrophe will lead to financial ruin. Every Republican and Democrat in Congress ought to reflect on the need for a bipartisan commitment to this goal. If President Truman's plan for universal care or President Nixon's effort to create national health insurance had passed, the country would almost certainly be healthier today, both physically and economically.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930912","headline":"Riverhead Aims to Shake Doldrums","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/12/nyregion/riverhead-aims-to-shake-doldrums.html","abstract":"BIG changes are in the works for Riverhead, where vacant storefronts, homeless people and crack houses have been major sources of news. \n\nIn the planning stages are a mall for outlet stores, a trolley service between the mall and downtown and an aquarium for the Okeanos Foundation that is expected to draw close to one million visitors a year.

The answer is hardly of epic proportions -- pocket-sized, in fact. But discovering the tenuous pop-cultural connections of its dramatis personae is part of the wifty charm of MADE IN JAPAN: Transistor Radios of the 1950s and 1960s (Chronicle, paper, $16.95). In this celebration of the latest collectible artifact for aging baby boomers, a team of Californians -- Roger Handy, Maureen Erbe, Aileen Antonier and Henry Blackham -- labors not very mightily to establish that the transistor radio is \"more than an icon for popular culture, a point of no return for American values, a seminal piece of technical wizardry and the first volley in the continuing skirmish of goods production between Japan and America.\" References to Marcel Duchamp aside, their book seems less a serious attempt to see the transistor radio as \"an art form in its own right\" and more an excuse to fool around with what passed for space-age design in the era of the extravagantly tail-finned pink Cadillac. Whether you tucked it into an elegant leather handbag, a la Grace Kelly, or, taking a cue from Brandon de Wilde in \"Hud,\" let it poke out of a denim jacket, the transistor radio may not have been, as the authors playfully insist, \"integral . . . to the issues of defiance, sex, freedom, music and mobility.\" But it certainly made them more fun.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930912","headline":"Ms. Ackerley, Mr. Bollinger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/12/style/weddings-ms-ackerley-mr-bollinger.html","abstract":"  Margaret Lee Ackerley, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James A.

Unlike Nassau County, Suffolk residents are fortunate that they will have the ability this November to alter their political landscape for years to come.   Locally, I am convinced term limitations is a way of diffusing the egregious and far-reaching powers enjoyed by the Democratic and Republican Parties on Long Island. For instance, this issue will in part deal with the concomitant problem of patronage and self-appointment politics, which continues to hinder good government both in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.   Yet, I feel compelled to answer some critics on this issue. Brookhaven Town Councilmembers Joseph Macchia and Patricia Strebel, both Republicans, feel that once term limits are imposed the citizenry would lose \"very talented and effective legislators.\" This argument is completely disingenuous, since it has been a common view promulgated by politicians who seemingly feel they are politically indispensable.   Secondly, Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer, a Democrat, sees the import of \"experienced\" legislators. The word \"experience\" in politics is probably the most overrated and overused concept, but nevertheless impacts on the mind of the voter. For any politician touting his experience during re-election time it is often a win-win scenario. Here is a clear example of an institutional problem which could only be rectified by mandating limits on legislative tenure. So called \"experience\" politicians, like 10-year incumbent Mario M. Cuomo, have failed miserably in reaching budget decisions, improving transportation, providing decent education, or deterring crime. Ms. Shaffer fails to understand what historian Daniel Boorstein poignantly understood; legislators must be kept to the \"amateur spirit.\"   Term limitations, or as Jefferson called it, \"rotation of public service,\" has three advantages. First, rotation provides an opportunity for a greater number of individuals to serve in government. Second, it serves as a check on tyranny and selfish political power. But most importantly the Founding Fathers believed that rotation both facilitates and affirms the experimental connection that must exist between the representatives and represented.   Perhaps term limits is a movement of emotion and simplicity, as Professor Cover suggests. But what politicians and academicians fail to understand is that simplicity and common sense can indeed yield profound political, social, and economic change. THOMAS R.

FRIEDMAN (D) Housing policy analyst with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development; former teacher; member, Community Board 6; chairwoman, Housing and Homeless Committee, Community Board 6. ANTONIO PAGAN (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former executive director of Coalition Housing, a nonprofit developer of low- and moderate-income housing; former member, Community Board 3. THE CAMPAIGN: At the age of 79, Ms. Friedlander is fighting to regain her seat from Mr. Pagan. She was the only Council member to lose in the 1991 primary, by barely over 100 votes out of 12,000 cast in the ethnic and political cauldron of Gramercy Park, the East Village and Lower East Side. While Mr. Pagan is gay, the city's other two gay legislators, Councilman Thomas K. Duane and Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, pointedly backed Ms. Friedlander. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan also mobilized support for her. Mr. Pagan also has a long list of endorsements, and benefits from popularity with Hispanic voters. By Aug. 13, Ms. Friedlander had raised $64,960, compared with $56,509 for Mr. Pagan. Sylvia Friedman, a newcomer to the race, who could siphon votes from Ms. Friedlander's base as a liberal Jewish woman, raised $41,530. 3d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Thomas K. Duane (D-L) is the incumbent. 4th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Andrew S. Eristoff (R-L) is the incumbent.  5th COUNCIL DISTRICT  BARBARA W. KLOBERDANZ (D) Political consultant; former teacher; former member, Community Board 8. SAMUEL D. MORELL (D) Liquor sales, wine imports; former salesman in wholesale and retail clothing; a candidate for City Council in 1980, 1982 and 1985.  No Republican primary. Charles Millard (R-L) is the incumbent.  THE CAMPAIGN: The Democratic winner here faces the unenviable task of running in November's election against Charles Millard, the Republican-Liberal incumbent. Ms. Kloberdanz, City Council President's liaison to the Council, is backed by several political clubs and legislators. She stresses quality of life issues and Council oversight powers. Mr. Morrell, who proposes a medical van for the elderly, Upper East Side jitneys and using vacant lots for parking, has run several times before. 6th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Ronnie M. Eldridge (D-L) is the incumbent. 7th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Stanley E. Michels (D-L) is the incumbent. 8th COUNCIL DISTRICT  WILLIAM DEL TORO (D) Minister, Chapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; chairman of the Community Housing Anti-Crime/Anti-Drug Task Force; a candidate for City Council in 1991. FRANCISCO DIAZ JR. (D) District Manager, Community Board 11; former Housing Development Adviser for Homesteading Coalition; community organizer in East Harlem. ADAM CLAYTON POWELL 4TH (D-L)City Council member elected in 1991; son of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the late Harlem Congressman; former assistant district attorney in the Bronx; worked for Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. THE CAMPAIGN: Adam Clayton Powell 4th, 31, is struggling to keep his seat in this district that encompasses part of the South Bronx. In 1991, William Del Toro squeezed by Mr. Powell with 34 votes in the first tally but lost to him in a court-ordered runoff after hundreds of voting irregularities were found. Mr. Del Toro has returned to challenge Mr. Powell. The Del Toro name carries clout in East Harlem, where most of the district's residents live. Mr. Del Toro is a minister and the brother of State Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro.   A wild card in the race is a third candidate, Francisco Diaz Jr. Mr. Diaz, who is on leave from his job as district manager of Community Board 11, has the backing of Congressman Charles B. Rangel.    All candidates claim to have toiled in different arenas to help solve the district's most pressing problems: drugs, crime, poor services and a housing shortage. But the outcome may be decided less on issues than on political alliances and the influence of the candidates' supporters. 9th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. C. Virginia Fields (D-L) is the incumbent. 10th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Guillermo Linares (D-L) is the incumbent. BRONX BOROUGH PRESIDENT  MONICA BRAGGS (D) Real-estate saleswoman; co-founder and chairwoman, CENBRO Local Development Corporation, a community outreach organization in central Bronx; member, N.A.A.C.P.; Executive member (Secretary), Community Board 4 and serves on its Economic Development and Youth committees. FERNANDO FERRER (D-L) Borough President since 1987; former City Council member, served five years; former chairman, Council Health Committee; former Housing Director in the Bronx Borough President's office; member, N.A.A.C.P. THE CAMPAIGN: Fernando Ferrer, one of the most powerful Hispanic politicians in the city, is seeking a second full term as Borough President. He was first elected to the post in 1987 to fill out the term of Stanley Simon, who resigned in a corruption scandal. Mr. Ferrer's opponent is a political newcomer, Monica Braggs, who works in real-estate sales.   11th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. June M. Eisland (D-L) is the incumbent. 12th COUNCIL DISTRICT  CAROLYN J. ALESSANDRO (D) Computer specialist; graduated from Brooklyn College; involved in successful campaign by husband, Francis, for Civil Court Judge in the Bronx in 1990. SAMUEL BURKE (D) Supervisor of transportation, Montefiore Hospital; former legislative aide to Senator Jeff Korman; member, Community Board 10, serves on Health and Human Services Committee; member, Public School 178 Parents Association; member, N.A.A.C.P. LAWRENCE A. WARDEN (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former health care administrator; member, N.A.A.C.P. THE CAMPAIGN: Old political scores are being settled here. Councilman Warden was first elected in 1991 with the help of the Bronx Democratic chairman, George Friedman, but then backed an insurgent bid led by Larry Seabrook to oust Mr. Friedman. That failed, and now Mr. Warden now finds his renomination challenged by Mr. Burke, a party district leader endorsed by Mr. Friedman. Both candidates are black, but Mr. Burke's home base is Co-op City, which has a heavily voting white population. But Mr. Warden also has support in Co-op City, the advantage of incumbency and the Seabrook faction's backing. 13th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Michael DeMarco (D-R-C) is the incumbent. 14th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Israel Ruiz Jr. (D-L) is the incumbent. 15th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Jose Rivera (D-L) is the incumbent. 16th COUNCIL DISTRICT  WENDELL FOSTER (D-L) City Council member elected in 1978; minister, Christ Church; Chairman, International Intergroup Relations Committee; member, Finance, Education and Parks Committees; member, N.A.A.C.P., World Peace Council and the Urban League; Founder, Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corporation, which builds low-income housing. CARMELO SAEZ JR. (D) Community advocate; management consultant; President, School Board 9; former member, Community Board 4; former director, Development of Youth Inc., a private nonprofit center for youth; former executive director, Alianza, a federation of Hispanic organizations in the Bronx.  THE CAMPAIGN: This contest pits a longtime minister against the chief of a scandal-ridden school board. The Rev. Wendell Foster has served on the Council 15 years. His challenger, Mr. Saez, was removed as school board president in District 9 last year, accused of mismanaging funds and using school equipment for private business.    The district suffers from low reading scores. Nine board members have been arrested in cases involving theft, extortion, kickback and abuse of office. Denying wrongdoing himself, Mr. Saez won re-election to the board this year. Mr. Foster raised a hefty $76,088 campaign chest by Aug. 13. Mr. Saez did not file a financial report by the deadline. 17th COUNCIL DISTRICT  RAFAEL CASTANEIRA COLON (D) City Council member elected in 1981; Chairman, Civil Service and Labor Committee. DAVID ROSADO (D-L) New York State Assemblyman (74th Assembly District), elected 1990; former district leader; former member, Community Board 2 and Area Policy Board 2; former member, Community Board 1; Youth Coordinator, New York City Youth Bureau; administrative, alcoholism rehabilitation program; former machinist and garment worker. ANDREW EATMON JR. (D) A Legal Aid lawyer. THE CAMPAIGN: Despite a 704-count indictment accusing Councilman Colon of stealing $389,000 in city funds, he proclaimed his innocence and continued his reelection bid. Prosecutors said he cashed paychecks for phantom employees and also voted from a false home address.    Before being indicted, his career was already troubled. Democratic leaders and Ramon Valez, the powerful local head of private social service agencies, abandoned Mr. Colon after his girlfriend accused him of assault in a child support dispute. There were accusations that he lived outside the council district. Earlier, Mr. Colon's ex-wife said his failure to pay alimony forced her onto welfare. The new candidate backed by the party and Mr. Velez is Assemblyman Rosado.    Andrew Eatmon Jr. ran for this seat in 1991, but Mr. Colon prevailed.   A fourth contender, Rafael Mendez, a perennial candidate from the radical New Alliance Party, was removed from the primary ballot for lack of sufficient signatures in August, but he remains on the ballot in November as an Independent. Financial filings on Aug. 13 showed Mr. Colon had raised $39,1756. State filings showed that Mr. Rosado had $1,300 in loans and contributions. 18th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Lucy Cruz (D-L) is the incumbent. QUEENS BOROUGH PRESIDENT   There is no primary. Claire Shulman (D) is the incumbent.   19th COUNCIL DISTRICT    ANTHONY P. AVELLA JR. (D-L) Columnist, \"The Courier\"; president, Joint Community Council of College Point; former Queens coordinator, Mayor's Community Assistance Unit; former member, Community Board 7.   EDWARD S. GITKIND (D) Special projects manager, New York City Department of Environmental Protection; former production manager; executive member, Bayside High School P.T.A..  No Republican primary. Michael J. Abel (R-C) is the incumbent. THE CAMPAIGN: Whoever wins this race faces a bigger challenge in November, opposing Mr. Abel in this district dominated by Republican voters. Democratic leaders are lined up for Mr. Avella. In the 1991 primary, Mr. Avella placed second among 10 candidates, the Council's most crowded contest that year. This time he faces only Mr. Gitkind, a business and government manager. 20th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Julia Harrison (D-L) is the incumbent. 21st COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Helen M. Marshall (D-L) is the incumbent. 22d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Peter F. Vallone (D) is the incumbent. 23d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Sheldon S. Leffler (D-L) is the incumbent. 24th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Morton Povman (D) is the incumbent. 25th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. John D. Sabini (D-L) is the incumbent. 26th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Walter L. McCaffrey (D-L) is the incumbent. 27th COUNCIL DISTRICT  GARTH MARCHANT (D) Former radio reporter, WLIB; former assistant to the Superintendent, Community School District 23.  ARCHIE SPIGNER (D-L) City Council member elected in 1973; chairman, Housing and Buildings Committee; member, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Spigner, who in 18 years in office has risen to deputy majority leader, trounced Mr. Marchant in 1991 with 70 percent of the vote. For this return match, Mr. Spigner had $111,975 in campaign funds on hand on Aug. 13, one of the largest campaign treasuries in the Council, while Mr. Marchant had $1,022.    28th COUNCIL DISTRICT  ALLAN W. JENNINGS JR. (D) Former investigator, New York City Department of Correction; former Democratic district leader, 31st Assembly District; former legislative adviser to New York State Assemblyman John Duane. THOMAS WHITE JR. (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; founder and chief executive officer, Jamaica Community Adolescent Program (J-CAP); member, Aging, Contracts, Economic Development and Environmental Protection Committees. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman White swept nearly half the total vote when he won in 1991 against five primary opponents. Mr. Jennings, a district leader at odds with the county party, placed fourth with 9 percent of the vote. This time he is the only challenger.    Mr. White is a district leader, too, and is outspending his opponent. Mr. White, who runs a state-financed drug rehabilitation program, denied critics' charges that he pressured clients and workers to do political chores. He said there were 27 campaign workers, all voluntary, from 500 people in the program.  29th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Karen Koslowitz (D-L) is the incumbent. 30th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Thomas V. Ognibene (R-C) is the incumbent. 31st COUNCIL DISTRICT  EDWARD J. LEWIS (D) Business developer; marketing specialist; former director, Mayor's Office of African-American and Caribbean Affairs; member, N.A.A.C.P.; board member, Southeast Queens Park Association; vice chairman, Area Policy Board. JUANITA E. WATKINS (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former Commissioner, New York City Civil Service Commission; former schoolteacher; former editor, McGraw-Hill Inc. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilwoman Watkins eked out an initial victory of a few dozen votes out of 9,000 cast in 1991. The margin was so thin that a judge ordered a runoff with the runner-up from her eight opponents. She won that second primary by more than 1,200 votes. This time her only challenger is Mr. Lewis. By Aug. 13, her campaign had raised $41,476 to his $3,530. 32d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Walter Ward (D-C) is the incumbent. BROOKLYN BOROUGH PRESIDENT   There is no primary. Howard Golden (D) is the incumbent. 33d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Kenneth K. Fisher (D-L) is the incumbent.     34th COUNCIL DISTRICT  F. LOUIS CARABALLO (D) Lawyer in private practice. Candidate for State Assembly in 54th District in 1992.   VICTOR L. ROBLES (D-L) City Council member, has served nine years; chairman, Youth Committee; supports creation of all-civilian complaint review board. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Robles has served nine years on Council and six in State Assembly. In four-way primary in 1991, he swept half the vote and led nearest rival by 2,600. His sole opponent this time, Mr. Caraballo, is a lawyer and community activist who ran unsuccessfully for Assembly last year. 35th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Mary Pinkett (D-L) is the incumbent. 36th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Annette M. Robinson (D-L) is the incumbent. 37th COUNCIL DISTRICT     No primary. Martin Malave-Dilan (D-L) is the incumbent. 38th COUNCIL DISTRICT  JOAN GRIFFIN McCABE (D) City Council member elected in 1991; former policy analyst, Public Education Association; member, Public School 154 P.T.A.; opposed Brooklyn Navy Yard Incinerator. JOHN K. O'HARA (D) Lawyer in private practice; former cabdriver; member, Community Board 7 and Area Policy Board; chairman, Youth Services Committee of Community Board 7; candidate for City Council in 1991. MIGDALIA RIVERA (D-L) President, New York Paralegal School, a private school she co-founded; interior designer. THE CAMPAIGN: This strangely shaped district was designed to give Hispanic voters a majority and a Council member. But nine contenders crowded the 1991 ballot, including three Hispanics and a black who split the minority vote. The upshot was that Ms. McCabe, who is white, won with 22 percent.    This time the contest's ethnic makeup is reversed. Hispanic groups unified behind a single candidate, Ms. Rivera, who also has important union support. The second challenger, Mr. O'Hara, competes with Councilwoman McCabe's ethnic base. He drew 10 percent of the 1991 vote. Party organization leaders also oppose Ms. McCabe, who says she is too independent for their liking. Despite the odds, she is running hard, has her own organization and by Aug. 13 had raised $47,979, more than double the total for her two opponents. 39th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Stephen DiBrienza (D-L) is the incumbent. 40th COUNCIL DISTRICT  UNA CLARKE (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former educational consultant, Human Resources Administration; supports creation of all-civilian complaint board; member of Committee on Youth, Health and General Welfare. ERNEST N. FOSTER (D) Businessman, has worked in catering and restaurants, real estate and building management; member, N.A.A.C.P.; supports creation of all-civilian complaint board; former member, Area Policy Board 14. THE CAMPAIGN: Ms. Clarke became the first Caribbean-born Council member when she narrowly won a three-way primary in 1991. This year she has one challenger, Mr. Foster, an American-born black. He has allied himself with Alton Maddox and Al Sharpton and contends that blacks in Flatbush are \"under 100 percent white control.\" Ms. Clarke claims broad support and by Aug. 13 had raised $52,195, compared with $3,300 for her opponent. 41st COUNCIL DISTRICT  ATCHUDTA BARKR (D) Union organizer; organizer, National Union of Health and Human Service Employees; former P.T.A. president, Boys and Girls High School. ENOCH H. WILLIAMS (D) City Council member for 15 years; former executive director, Housing Development Corporation; member of the Brooklyn chapter of New York City Council of Churches; member, N.A.A.C.P. and New York Urban League; chairman, Health Committee. THE CAMPAIGN: Mr. Williams, a longtime Council member and chairman of its Health Committee, won the 1991 primary by a ratio of 2-to-1. But his challenger this year, Ms. Barkr, is supported by several liberal and labor groups. Their Aug. 13 campaign financial filings showed him far ahead, with $30,250 to her $1,795.  42d COUNCIL DISTRICT    SANDY BENDER JR. (D) Administrative assistant to New York State Assemblyman William Frank Boyland; former civil servant, worked in Department of Social Services; former day care teacher; regional representative of Community Action Board for Area Policy Boards 5 and 16; former chairman, Area Policy Board 16.   DIANE GORDON (D)  PRISCILLA A. WOOTEN (D-L) City Council member since 1982; former assistant to the Board of Education; chairwoman, Education Committee; member, Finance and Land Use Committees; member, N.A.A.C.P.  THE CAMPAIGN: After a decade on the Council, Ms. Wooten faces two challengers. She is supported by the party organization, unions and the local United States Representative, Edolphus Towns. One opponent, Mr. Bender, has been outpacing her in fund-raising. By Aug. 13 he had raised $25,888, exceeding her $19,675. The other challenger is Diane Gordon, who is backed by a party district leader who has a longstanding rivalry with Ms. Wooten. 43d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Sal F. Albanese (D-L) is the incumbent. 44th COUNCIL DISTRICT  SANDY ABBY ABOULAFIA (D) Businesswoman; personnel agent and data processing manager; member, Community Board 12; endorsed by Brooklyn Women's Political Caucus, Kings County Democratic Coalition and Progressive Democratic Club; candidate for City Council in 1991. NOACH DEAR (D) City Council member since 1983; chairman, Transportation Committee; former district manager, Community Board 12; endorsed by Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Dear, who nearly lost in 1991 to Robert J. Miller, is breathing easier this year. He has one opponent, Sandy Abby Aboulafia, who drew 7 percent of the vote as the third-place candidate the last time.    Mr. Dear is counting on his many endorsements, party organization support and an extraordinary campaign treasury of more than $90,000 as of Aug. 13, compared with $24,465 for Ms. Aboulafia. His July 13 financial report showed he had spent another $99,363, ranking him among the top Council campaign spenders, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group, which monitors the filings. 45th COUNCIL DISTRICT  LLOYD HENRY (D-L) Headmaster, St. Augustine's Day School; rector, St. Augustine's Church; member, Community Board 17, N.A.A.C.P., Kiwanis and the Boy Scouts of America.  COLIN A. MOORE (D) Lawyer in private practice; former Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx; former Law Clerk with State Attorney General's Office; member, 29th Street Block Association. JANICE L. ROBERTSON (D) Community organizer; founder and president, East 49th Street Block Association of Flatlands Inc.; member, 63d Precinct Community Council; member, Public School 203 P.T.A.; endorsed by Kings County Democratic Coalition; candidate for City Council in 1991. THE CAMPAIGN: This is shaping up as one of the city's most contentious Council battles. Carved out two years ago to encourage minority candidates, the largely working-class district is 75 percent black. Susan D. Alter, who is white, managed to keep the seat in 1991 by capturing the Jewish vote in the primary; she is abandoning her seat to run for Public Advocate and is endorsing Ms. Robertson, a black American-born community advocate.    Colin Moore, a 52-year-old Guyana-born lawyer who has developed a citywide reputation through his involvement in high-profile cases, came in second to Ms. Alter in 1991 and considers himself the logical heir to both the seat and the support of Democratic Party officials in Brooklyn. But the party has instead backed Lloyd Henry, a 45-year-old Belize-born Episcopal minister and newcomer to politics. An unusually wide array of elected officials are stumping for Mr. Henry, including the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, a United States Representative, Edolphus Towns, and Mayor David N. Dinkins.  46th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Herbert E. Berman (D-L) is the incumbent. 47th COUNCIL DISTRICT  HOWARD L. LASHER (D-L) New York State Assemblyman since 1972; lawyer; chairman, Assembly Committees on Child Care, Housing and Insurance; member, Fraternal Order of Masons. JOEL M. MICHAELS (D) Lawyer; former executive director, Jewish Community Council of Greater Brighton; member, Brighton Neighborhood Association and Nottingham Association; former social worker; a candidate for City Council (48th District) in 1991. SHELDON PLOTNICK (D) owner of bookkeeping and financial services company; member, Community School Board 21; current member, Community Board 13; former Democratic State Committeeman. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Samuel Horwitz's retirement set off a brutal fight to succeed him. For 21 years Mr. Plotnick served on the community board and as school board president and local party leader. For 21 years, Mr. Lasher served as the local Assemblyman, gaining seniority to head committees.    Both sides are slinging charges: That Mr. Plotnick used the schools for patronage and nepotism, including a job for his mother and promotions for his wife; that Mr. Lasher took donations from insurance companies when he headed the Insurance Committee, and that he keeps a one-bedroom apartment to qualify for the Council district but his four-bedroom home is a few blocks over the border.    Although their Aug. 13 filings showed that Mr. Plotnick outspent Mr. Lasher by nearly double, $55,017 to $28,213, Mr. Plotnick said Mr. Lasher used his Assembly apparatus for mailings to voters. The third candidate, Mr. Michaels, said the others represent the abuses of entrenched politicians. Brooklyn's Democratic chairman, Clarence Norman, calling the contest \"a slugfest all the way,\" made no predictions or endorsements. 48th COUNCIL DISTRICT  ALEXANDER STABER (D) Retired businessman, appliance repair; co-chairman, Brooklyn-wide Interagency Council of the Aging; vice president, American Association of Retired Persons, Flatbush Chapter; member, Straphangers Campaign; opposed rebuilding the Southwest Brooklyn incinerator. ANTHONY DAVID WEINER (D) City Council member, elected in 1991; former aide to Representative Charles E. Schumer.  THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Weiner squeaked into office in the six-way 1991 primary by a margin of slightly more than 100 votes. He faces only one challenger this time, Mr. Staber, a longtime activist on health, the elderly, war veterans and housing who has run for office often but unsuccessfully. Their Aug. 13 financial reports showed Mr. Weiner had raised $26,675 and Mr. Staber $7,737. 50th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. John A. Fusco (R-C) is the incumbent. STATEN ISLAND BOROUGH PRESIDENT   There is no primary. Guy V. Molinari (R) is the incumbent.   49th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Jerome X. O'Donovan (D-C) is the incumbent.   50th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. John A. Fusco (R-C) is the incumbent.   51st COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Alfred C.

Williams, who rushed for 81 yards on 11 carries for Spellman, led the way defensively from the linebacker position along with Abebe Lawrence, a defensive tackle, and Daniel Carr, a cornerback.

The Breeders are led by the ever-smiling Kim Deal on rhythm guitar; she used to play bass for the Pixies, and the songs she writes still have bass lines that swagger and pump. Above them, Kelley Deal (Kim's sister) plays tersely melodic guitar licks, while Kim Deal strums distorted chords on an acoustic guitar and sings in a voice that can be breathy, raw or girlishly winsome.    For the length of a few verses and few choruses, the music has all the confidence of its roots in 1960's surf rock and garage rock; it's lean, brash pop. But in alternative rock, nothing arrives unmixed. The Breeders' songs shift abruptly from soft to loud, and they stop and start, mocking their own momentum; they end suddenly, as if determined not to overstay their welcome. It's a twist on the unquestioning arrogance of previous, overwhelmingly male rock bands, a skepticism made more explicit when Josephine Wiggs, on bass, sang a deadpan version of Aerosmith's \"Lord of the Thighs.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930913","headline":"RU-486: When?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/13/opinion/ru-486-when.html","abstract":"  RU-486, the French-manufactured \"abortion pill\" which should be available here in about two years, has been used safely by thousands of Europeans.

His French teammate, Alain Prost, had quite the reverse. Jean Alesi of France thrilled Italian fans by driving a Ferrari to second place, and Michael Andretti finished third, his best Formula One finish this year, in a McLaren-Ford. Andretti, who fought back in the second half of the race after spinning off in the second lap, said he was delighted to have made his first trip to the podium in Formula One. Prost, a 38-year-old French veteran, saw his Renault engine explode four and a half laps from the checkered flag and from his fourth world title. He led for 48 laps after roaring off from the pole position. (AP) Fittipaldi Is Still in the Race: Emerson Fittipaldi kept the Indy-car championship battle alive with a runaway victory in the Pioneer Electronics 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. It was a turnaround for Fittipaldi, who had been struggling since winning at Portland, Ore., on June 27, and a day of missed opportunities for PPG Cup point leader, Nigel Mansell, and Fittipaldi's teammate, Paul Tracy. Mansell, who went into the 199.3-mile, 89-lap race with a 34-point lead over Fittipaldi and a 47-point lead over Tracy, started from the pole and had a good chance to wrap up the championship with two races remaining. (AP) GOLF Birdie on 18th Gives Frost Canadian Title David Frost, given an opening by the back-nine collapse of Brad Bryant, two-putted for birdie on the final hole yesterday to win the Canadian Open by a stroke. The 34-year-old South African scored his seventh PGA Tour victory, closing with a four-under-par 68 for a 279 total on the Glen Abbey Golf Club course in Oakville, Ontario. (AP) Elements Are Kind to Murphy: First the weather took away some of Bob Murphy's weapons. Then it gave him his second victory on the Senior PGA Tour. Murphy became the winner of the GTE North Classic in Indianapolis when rain and lightning forced officials to cancel yesterday's final round of the 54-hole tournament. Murphy never had to take a club out of his bag to win with a 10-under 134. (AP) DOG SHOW  Schnauzer Takes Top Honors A standard schnauzer, Ch.

They're all virtually the same, and even one of the giants of 70's rock, Aerosmith, who performed on Saturday night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., plods through them with the same formula: a few power ballads, solo guitar and drum sections, and lots and lots of volume and excess, especially at the service of rebellion and sexuality.   But critics of pop culture usually put the emphasis in the wrong place, thinking in terms of artists, originality and creativity instead of the audience's needs. The wildly cheering sellout crowd for Aerosmith had probably seen the same routine dozens of times before, and it didn't care a bit. There's a clear need, culturally, for some sort of transcendence in entertainment, and the band and its lead singer, Steven Tyler, were there to supply it.
