Images flash of a body bag, a chalk outline of a corpse, \"for sale\" signs, a \"going out of business\" sign. Finally, the camera pans across a rubble-strewn city lot, followed by a grim-looking shot of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (the producers say the photographs were all taken in New York over the last week). SCRIPT -- \"This is Mario Cuomo's New York. Cuomo coddles criminals. Day and night, we are in danger -- on the street, at work, in school, even in our homes. Cuomo imposes crippling taxes. Business withers, jobs disappear, families suffer, dreams die. Cuomo plays politics. Working men and women pay the bills. Twelve years of Mario Cuomo. Can you afford four more? Dump Cuomo. Build New York.\" ACCURACY -- It is true that people can often be in danger in New York, that some businesses wither and that some dreams die, but it is difficult if not impossible to make a case that it is true of New York alone or that Mr. Cuomo is solely responsible. But this dark portrait is not meant as history; it is an emotional summation of the three themes that may defeat Mr. Cuomo: crime, jobs and taxes. SCORECARD -- This ad was financed by the real estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld, but it is as if it came from Dante, depicting New York as hell. There has been bad blood between the two men: in 1986, Mr. Cuomo knocked Mr. Hirschfeld off the ballot when he tried to run for lieutenant governor and last year, Mr. Cuomo successfully opposed Mr. Hirschfeld's attempts to buy the New York Post. Though he says it is not revenge, Mr. Hirschfeld says he is spending from $250,000 to $1 million to broadcast this ad, first in New York City and Albany, then perhaps across the state. Mr. Hirschfeld said he supports the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki (who is not mentioned in the ad), but that his primary reason for the ad was \"to help my fellow man\" by presenting his vision of New York State under Mr. Cuomo.    As a bit of television drama, it makes its case with undeniable force. But some viewers might see it as being so negative, its claims so sweeping, that they might dismiss it entirely.

Realism, of course, is a slippery thing: now that a televised production from Rome has presented the work staged in the actual settings and at the right times of day, Mr. Zeffirelli's grandiose, intensely detailed sets look less like virtual reality and more like theatrical facsimiles. And say what one will about them, they are really distracting only when the singing and acting fail to command the attention.   That was not a problem on Wednesday. Luciano Pavarotti, who has been known to sleepwalk through \"Tosca\" in recent seasons, was in spectacular form as Cavaradossi. His voice sounded younger and fresher than it did a year ago, and he sang with a passion and magnetism that made his Cavaradossi a defiant hero. In his showpieces, \"Recondita armonia\" and \"E lucevan le stelle,\" he found an emotional depth that made the arias moving rather than merely crowd-pleasing. Smaller touches were equally effective: Cavaradossi's brief celebration of Napoleon's victory -- his shouted \"Vittoria! Vittoria!\" in the second act -- rarely has the spontaneity or the chilling power that Mr. Pavarotti brought to it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941007","headline":"From the Early Days, Images of a Voyager Who Died at 24","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/arts/photography-review-from-the-early-days-images-of-a-voyager-who-died-at-24.html","abstract":"  Until recently, the photography of the 19th century was like a lost continent, a semi-mythical place known largely through images whose subjects and makers were equally forgotten.

The fruits of some of those efforts are on view in New York City this month. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is featuring the work of Edouard Baldus, a French photographer famed for his commanding views of architecture and industrial forms in the 1850's; in SoHo, the James Danziger Gallery, in association with Hans P.

Organized by Elizabeth Sussman, the show leaves no doubt that Mr. Jenney is an artist overdue for reassessment, but it also suggests why he remains a marginal figure.    His debt to earlier American art is clear at a glance. His reiterated images of blasted trees and sunset skies, for example, were standard Hudson River School emblems of decay and renewal, fraught with allegorical implications. Mr. Jenney acknowledges the symbolic nature of his own paintings by stenciling their didactic-sounding titles directly onto their frames.

Indeed, the poise and inventiveness of Matthew Greenbaum's \"Enharmonicon\" left a deep impression. The combination of clarinet, trumpet and violin gives off natural, vivid color combinations. The contrapuntal exchange of short phrases and single strokes, along with a use of silence, has both reticence and eloquence. There is a quiet confidence here requiring no salesmanship.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941008","headline":"1944: Dumbarton Ends : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/08/opinion/IHT-1944-dumbarton-ends-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON - The Dumbarton Oaks conference of the United States, Great Britain, Russia and China concluded today [Oct. 8] as a four-power statement was awaited describing the contemplated world security organization and its international council, assembly","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941008","headline":"Nature of Health Care Will Change, With or Without Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/08/opinion/l-nature-of-health-care-will-change-with-or-without-reform-471046.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Ills of Health System Outlive Debate on Care\" (Week in Review, Oct. 2), your postmortem on health care reform, is on the mark.
