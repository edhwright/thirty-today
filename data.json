His current exhibition at PaceWildenstein on East 57th Street is his best in several years. For a while, it seemed that Mr. Shapiro, one of several talented Post-Minimalist sculptors who emerged in the late 1960's and early 70's, was becoming his generation's answer to Henry Moore. He had all but perfected a race of semi-abstract falling figures, built in blocky beams of wood and then cast in bronze, that had proved quite popular; judging from the life style magazines, it often seemed that a Shapiro figure poolside was de rigueur in Hollywood.    Perhaps Mr. Shapiro's recent commission for the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington pushed him to greater depths in his art, or a moment of reassessment. That piece intensified the drama of his staple forms: not only the ambiguously unbalanced figure whose skewed beamlike limbs seemed to signal human catastrophe, but also the abbreviated geometric house shape, which for this occasion was presented precariously on edge. In that work, Mr. Shapiro depicted a world being blown apart with a clarity of form and meaning that can be the mark of a successful -- which is to say, accessible -- public monument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Fulton Market Fire Investigators Find Blaze Was Deliberately Set","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/nyregion/fulton-market-fire-investigators-find-blaze-was-deliberately-set.html","abstract":"  Fire Department officials said yesterday that the blaze that destroyed one of the two main commercial buildings at the Fulton Fish Market on Wednesday had been deliberately set.

The Statue of Liberty had not arrived and the first elevators had just been introduced.    Billy's may have changed a bit since then, but not so you'd notice. The 125-year-old restaurant, now owned by Joan Condren Borkowski, great-granddaughter of the founder, is still the archetypal family restaurant. It's the sort of place where waitresses carry children around on their shoulders chanting, \"I knew your mother when she was your age,\" and boys with long hair and big boots walk in with their parents, looking embarrassed but resigned.

The diagonal scaffolding of the mineheads, for instance, bore a striking resemblance to Robert Grosvenor's famous 1965 sculpture \"Tapanga,\" with its cantilevered diagonal arm. (\"Tapanga,\" in turn, was modeled on the Kitt Peak solar observatory in Arizona, designed in 1962 by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.)   The idea of an exchange between art and industry was very much in the air in the 1960's. In 1964, the Museum of Modern Art had an exhibition on \"20th-Century Engineering.\" In 1966, the artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman, together with two engineers, Billy Kluver and Fred Waldhauer, started a foundation dedicated to \"Experiments in Art and Technology.\" In 1967, the artist Robert Smithson's article \"Monuments of Passaic\" described derricks and pipes as works of art, posing the question: \"Has Passaic replaced Rome as the Eternal City?\" The next year, Smithson visited the Bechers in Germany, where they took him on a tour of the industrial area of Oberhausen, which he made a series of photographs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Isles Sunk by 3 Goals in a 5-Minute Penalty","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/sports/hockey-isles-sunk-by-3-goals-in-a-5-minute-penalty.html","abstract":"  With next Friday's trading deadline rapidly closing in, and the reluctant-to-trade General Manager Don Maloney admittedly talking to everybody within earshot, the Islanders found yet another way to lose at Nassau Coliseum tonight.

If Mr. Pataki wants a timely budget, he will have to compromise.   It is an old Albany axiom that the party that cares less about getting a rapid agreement ends up getting more out of the eventual deal. Mr. Pataki needs a budget agreement right now to establish his credentials as an effective Governor. An impasse does not redound to his credit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950331","headline":"Belfour's Deal Extended","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/31/sports/sports-people-nhl-belfour-s-deal-extended.html","abstract":"  Goalie ED BELFOUR signed a three-year, $8 million contract extension with the Chicago Blackhawks yesterday.

The prior administration left us with a $5 billion deficit and I don't have to tell any of you that New Yorkers are already the highest-taxed people in America.

Each day seems to bring a disturbing new disclosure in these cases. First Representative Robert Torricelli reported that a Guatemalan colonel on the C.I.A. payroll as an informant ordered the killing of Michael DeVine, an American living in Guatemala, and Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, a rebel leader married to an American, Jennifer Harbury. Though there is no evidence so far that the agency knew of the killings in advance, it withheld information about them after it learned, impeding the State Department's efforts to determine what had happened to the men.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950401","headline":"Up the River?

Hinckley Jr. opened fire. It was March 30, 1981. Mr. Hinckley, a 25-year-old mentally disturbed gun enthusiast, fired six shots at the Presidential entourage. Mr. Reagan suffered a near-fatal wound to the chest. His press secretary, James S. Brady, was hit above the left eye. Two other men were wounded. It was an old, old story. The insanity of gun violence, a crippling and seemingly incurable American disease, had flared again.   Fourteen years later the National Rifle Association, a fanatical organization that is awash in the blood of homicide and suicide victims, is accelerating its never-ending fight to expand the arsenal of guns in America. Weapons manufacturers in the U.S. are turning out more than 500 guns an hour, but the N.R.A. and its political henchmen are not satisfied.

The witness, Sharon-Jo Ramboz, said that years earlier, when she was a teen-ager, she was home alone when an assailant broke into the house, beat her and left her for dead. This time, she said, the rifle saved her life and the lives of her three children, and she supports Republican efforts to repeal a law passed last year banning them. But in the audience was another woman, Byrl Phillips-Taylor, whose 17-year-old son, Scott, was shot six times with an AK-47 fired by an 18-year-old classmate, and she was there to show her support of the assault-weapons ban. DELAYS IN CONGRESS -- A new political skirmish broke out in the Senate, again delaying a vote on midyear budget cuts and prompting the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, to threaten political war against the White House. \"We're not bringing up any more bills that the White House wants until we have some understanding on the legislation that we thought would go through here in a normal way,\" Mr. Dole said, suggesting that President Clinton was orchestrating Democratic efforts to slow work in the Senate. Mr. Clinton responded by chiding Mr. Dole for not having approved millions of dollars in emergency spending to cover the costs of military operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere. But any hope of a quick vote on that bill or the separate midyear budget cuts was further dimmed by a partisan fight over taxation of multimillionaires. Senator Edward M.

She wrenched the ankle sliding on a forehand return on Thursday against Amanda Coetzer. The Spaniard won that match, but yesterday her ankle was encased in bandages and ice packs.    Martinez overcame her own woeful display of tennis to reel off 12 straight games and reach the semifinals, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0, over Iva Majoli. Martinez will face Natasha Zvereva in today's semifinals, and Magdalena Maleeva, Sanchez Vicario's opponent, will meet Silvia Farina.
