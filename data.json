Or so I recalled, having spent my student years at Mount Holyoke, one of the colleges -- Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts are the others -- situated around the town of Amherst, a veritable New England Oxford. I had often contemplated returning to the valley to sample the season's pleasures, but had been deterred by the price. Renting a car from New York for three days costs almost $200, and even if you take the train to Springfield for a mere $51 round trip, you need to rent a car to reach the Five College Area. Amtrak offers service to Amherst as well, but the train, on its way to Montreal, stops in town at 2:40 A.M., and leaves for New York at 1:15 A.M.\n\nLast month, though, I called the Peter Pan bus company and learned that the round-trip fare between New York and Amherst is $37.95, with about 10 departures a day. The Amherst Chamber of Commerce helped me find a small local concern called North Amherst Motors where I reserved a car for $29.95 a day, and provided me with a list of lodging options, including the venerable Lord Jeffery Inn right on the town common, with 50 handsomely appointed rooms that rent for $80 to $120. As I was looking for something less expensive, I called several bed and breakfasts in the area and booked three nights in three different private homes for $40 to $65. Then I packed jeans, turtlenecks and clogs -- if I could no longer be mistaken for a student, I could at least try to blend in -- and boarded the bus at the Port Authority Terminal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"Commercial Property/The SoHo District; Grit to Glamour: The Evolution of SoHo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/realestate/commercial-property-the-soho-district-grit-to-glamour-the-evolution-of-soho.html","abstract":"  OVER the last few decades, SoHo has changed from a district for light manufacturing to a haven for artists to a home for the poshest of galleries.

The fact is that \"Middlemarch,\" like all great novels that happen to be very long, is a hybrid creature, made up of elements that do not always blend with perfect evenness. It is a mix of earnestness and breathiness, wisdom and pontification; it has the scope and grandeur of a Russian epic and the panting necessities of a schoolgirl romance.

Manet\" (1860) to the impertinent hauteur of the ivory-skinned \"Olympia\" (1863), the early 1860's saw Edouard Manet (1832-83) at his most innovative: no one had ever depicted decent bourgeois parents like this before, let alone shown a nude so defiantly available and so naked. In her very pleasant EDOUARD MANET (Bucknell University, $95), Vivien Perutz explains that barely a decade later, the new avant-garde of Monet, Degas and Impressionism forever changed the treatment of outdoor light and of the significant detail of modern life. Ms. Perutz's generous scholarship shares knowledge and pleasure. The author, an English art historian, enrolls critics from Charles Baudelaire to T. J. Clark to assess the extent of Manet's realistic and modernistic canvases. Above all, Manet's \"exceptionally acute visual judgment\" explodes with astonishing detail in more than 50 gorgeous color reproductions. In \"Argenteuil\" (1874), for instance, a young couple spend Sunday outside the city; Manet conveys the day's sweetness, luminosity and breeziness without a trace of effort.

They seem particularly valuable in cases of large-scale drug trafficking and terrorist thuggery.   But in the age of high technology, the wiretap is a dead duck. In the old days, all conversations associated with a given phone number were funneled through one physical pathway, and by spying on that pathway you could hear it all. Nowadays, cellular phones and call forwarding make it much harder to find the right spot and to attach a tap. New techniques coming into use will make it harder still: when many conversations are squished together and sent barreling over a high-capacity glass fiber, it's hard for wiretappers to extract the one conversation they are after from the resulting mush.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"That Pleasant Blur Is Bristol","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/travel/that-pleasant-blur-is-bristol.html","abstract":"A PENINSULA shaped like a lobster claw reaches out of southeastern Massachusetts into Narragansett Bay.

His books sent out a constant stream of reminders that the soggy old Serenissima was a good deal more than a beautiful corpse. For the past quarter-century, it was home to one of architecture's greatest living minds.   Yet the city's sumptuous decay provided an oddly sympathetic backdrop for Tafuri's lively polemical writings. His most influential books -- \"Theories and History of Architecture\" (1968) and \"Architecture and Utopia\" (1973) -- advanced the thesis that architecture itself was a beautiful corpse, an art form no longer sustainable in the modern world. Architecture, as he viewed it from his neo-Marxist perch, depended on a society's capacity to maintain a fixed relationship between forms and ideas. People could build cathedrals because the medieval social order was firm enough to insure that those looking at, say, a rose window would recognize it as a symbol of the Virgin's celestial powers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"DINING OUT;\nA Serene Spot Away From Hartsdale's Bustle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/nyregion/dining-out-a-serene-spot-away-from-hartsdales-bustle.html","abstract":"SET into a wooded hillside, Auberge Argenteuil enjoys an unusual situation -- serene and private, although busy Central Avenue is only a minute away.

That is a bizarre turnabout for a man who almost single-handedly bailed out the Clinton Presidency by rounding up Republican votes for a similar accord -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- over the opposition of House Democrats. Bizarre -- and wrong.    Mr. Gingrich says he is for world trade but against world government. He fears that the World Trade Organization, the oversight body provided for in the new agreement, would subject Americans to rules imposed by third world countries. But the W.T.O. would be more pussycat than tiger -- and would protect U.S. interests better than the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, which has governed trade for almost 50 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940508","headline":"Embracing Cape Ann's Contrasts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/travel/embracing-cape-ann-s-contrasts.html","abstract":"  MY first visit to Massachusetts' Cape Ann was on a cold, gray afternoon when surf detonated against the rocks, my scarf kept flying into my face and fishingboats pitched in such a forlorn way out in the harbors that it seemed impossible that anyone with a clear mind would want to live in this wind-struck, salt-struck place. Enormous granite boulders shouldered up against the beaches.  The ocean was the color of rain, and the wind smelled fishy. Ducking in and out of my car that day, I wasn't surprised that witches had thrown hexes on this spot, or that sea monsters had been sighted here by reliable witnesses, or that pirates had divvied up blood money on the rocks. Or, especially when I glanced up at the widow's walks crowning a few old houses near the shore, that thousands of mariners had drowned off this coast. Cape Ann, as far as I could see, had that grim obduracy that fosters both legends and bad dreams.    Two days later the ocean was silky, the sky was blue and Cape Ann was neat as a postcard and as far removed from witches, monsters and pirates as most romance novels are from real romance. Families posed beside a monument for lost fishermen; beachcombers bought candy shells from souvenir shops; camera-hung visitors wandered through art galleries that sell the sort of seascapes that have become more familiar than the sea itself. Water glittered behind 18th-century clapboard houses, which seemed only sweetly weatherbeaten.

At the Thread Waxing Space on Friday night, when this three-man band from Joshua Tree, Calif., topped a quadruple bill, a typical Giant Sand song might start out with a folky strummed guitar, move into a country-rock oompah, solidify into a hard-rock stomp or unleash a wailing, psychedelic guitar solo, dropping back into oompah now and then. The band's set also followed no fixed path as it meandered from folksiness to blare, then abandoned any momentum while Mr. Gelb decided on the next song. \"I guess we're sluggish,\" he observed halfway through an unhurried set; once a good part of the audience had left, he returned for a half-hour of more energetic encores.    Mr. Gelb's songs earn him his eccentricities. Beginning with Giant Sand's first single in 1981, he has created his own wayward updating of the 1960's. The music is steeped in Neil Young -- both the folksy simplicity and the grungy hard-rock -- but skewed toward Mr. Gelb's own timing and daydreams.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/nyregion/c-corrections-036498.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a chart on Saturday of the new South African Cabinet misstated the first name of a Minister Without Portfolio.

The moment the test concluded, however, there was mayhem, teachers said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"Review/Theater; Jumping Into the Melting Pot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/theater/review-theater-jumping-into-the-melting-pot.html","abstract":"  You would have to have been brought up in the Philippines to understand fully the cultural and emotional reverberations that the word \"hot dog\" sets off in the mind of a Filipino immigrant to the United States. In the Philippines, dog meat is an accepted dish. In America, slaughtering dogs for food is against the law.  A hot dog is not literally a hot dog.    \"Airport Music,\" a theatrical collage of poetry, reminiscences, slides and dance movement, written and performed by Jessica Hagedorn and Han Ong, makes much of such verbal dissonance. Again and again, it asks the audience to follow its creators in making imaginative verbal leaps between two cultures. Both Ms. Hagedorn, a multimedia artist, poet and novelist, and Mr. Ong, a Chinese-American playwright, are New York-based artists who grew up in the Philippines. In \"Airport Music,\" they offer interlocking meditations on the immigrant experience.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/arts/dance-in-review-043664.html","abstract":"  Wendy Whelan and Nilas Martins  'The Sleeping Beauty' New York City Ballet New York State Theater","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"Judge Kiser Misses the Beat, Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/opinion/judge-kiser-misses-the-beat-again.html","abstract":"  The judge who in 1991 upheld the right of the taxpayer-supported Virginia Military Institute to deny women admission to its \"unique\" training program has done it again.

The band wants to be liked, and isn't afraid to let it show. On Friday night at Roseland, the quartet went out of its way to make the audience feel special. Candlebox thanked its fans three times for coming to the concert, helped potential stage-divers climb onto the stage and held up a set of lost keys and announced that it could be picked up at the box office. This type of public service announcement usually isn't made at hard-rock shows, where there are often as many lost shoes and keys in the mosh pit as people.   Candlebox specializes in hard-rock entertainment. It plays well-rehearsed blues-infused rock-and-roll anthems that never get too indulgent or too soft. Kevin Martin, the singer, and Peter Klett, the guitarist, seem to have spent a lot of time rehearsing to Led Zeppelin records. They've also been taking lessons from alternative rock success stories like Pearl Jam and Soul Asylum. During its encore, Candlebox brought together its 1960's classic rock and late 1980's alternative-rock influences by performing the Doors' \"Roadhouse Blues\" and following it with Jane's Addiction's \"Mountain Song.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/nyregion/news-summary-035920.html","abstract":"  International A2-7 DETAILS ON NEW HAITI POLICY  President Clinton named a new envoy to Haiti, a well-known black Democrat, and discussed details of the new policy of allowing asylum hearings for Haitian refugees.  A1  HAITI ABUSES QUESTIONED  President Clinton reaffirmed his support for the exiled President of Haiti, but a cable from the American Ambassador there has charged that the President's supporters exaggerated human rights abuses. A7  A fast over Haiti policy was worth it, an activist said. A7  THE TOLL OF WAR IN ANGOLA  In Angola's rebel stronghold, life is a struggle, with no electricity or running water and little food or medicine, but the potential wealth of the country allows one of Africa's longest civil wars to continue. A1  IMPATIENCE IN JERICHO  The Israeli occupation is supposed to end in Jericho, but so far little has changed. The first contingent of the Palestinian police force was just six miles away, though, awaiting the signal to enter the area. A1  An international force went to Hebron to keep order. A3  SOUTH AFRICA'S CHALLENGE  Two men with very different backgrounds have responsibility in South Africa's new Cabinet for a complex task: improving the lives of the new electorate while protecting the stability of the economy. A6  THE BASIC ISSUE IN BOSNIA  News Analysis: the town of Brcko, seen as the next flash point of Bosnian conflict, is also a sign of why the war is unlikely to end soon: Muslims are fighting to go home to areas cleared by the Serbs.  A2  HEADING FOR BRAZIL  American business people are flocking to Brazil in a new display of confidence that economic ties between the two nations will revolve around trade and investment.

A4 National A8-14 PRESSURE ON THE FED  The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise short-term rates for the fourth time in four months, but it is under pressure to act more quickly and more sharply this time. A1  LOOKING OUT FOR ONE'S INTERESTS  The underlying story of why the Clinton Administration backed away from a proposed gambling tax to pay for part of the welfare plan illustrates the way the capital is patrolled by vigilant, organized interest groups.  A1  CRITICISM BY GAY SERVICEMEN  The \"don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue\" policy may have made life worse for homosexuals in the military, polarizing attitudes toward homosexuals and shifting the burden of proof to service members accused of engaging in homosexual acts.  A1  SETBACK FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS  Voters in Austin, Tex., have repealed a policy granting health benefits for the partners of homosexual and unmarried city employees, making the city the first of roughly 20 communities in the nation with such benefits to repeal its program.  A8  NEW BATTLE WAGED AT GETTYSBURG  A dispute over the loss of part of the Gettysburg battlefield is the outgrowth of a long-running debate over just how much land should be set aside in the shrine to thousands of Union and Confederate dead.  A8  DESEGREGATING HIGHER EDUCATION  At issue in a Federal trial in Oxford, Miss., is how the historically black public institutions of higher learning will be treated as their formerly all-white counterparts are often attracting the cream of the crop of black students.  A10  REACTION TO ASSAULT WEAPON BAN  One freshman Republican Congressman and his staff in mostly Democratic Long Beach, Calif., found little passion over the assault weapons bill, and most constituents, worried above all about crime, seemed to support the ban.  A12  SEXUAL HARASSMENT RE-EXAMINED  America has again been plunged into a national seminar on sexual harassment, a migraine issue full of gray areas and her-word-against-his contentions, with Prof. Anita Hill and Senator Bob Packwood now providing commentary.  A12  EMERGING FORCE IN HEALTH CARE  Robert Reischauer's Congressional Budget Office has no vote on health care legislation, but he and his team of analysts have emerged as a crucial voice in the current debate, with more influence at the moment than many lawmakers.

While these arguments are familiar, they seem inconsistent with today's reality.   Our society's traditionally homophobic attitudes have done more to tear apart families than gay marriages could.

Heterosexual bigots are more a threat to the American family than same-sex couples ever could be.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940509","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/09/nyregion/chronicle-043834.html","abstract":"  The Library of Congress held a luncheon the other day to honor RITA DOVE on the completion of her year as poet laureate of the United States, and, lamenting that her duties had kept her from writing much poetry, she said, \"I hope to change that this year.\"   Ms. Dove has accepted an appointment by James H.

Mathematical models of the system predict that sea-surface temperatures should rise by 3 to 7 degrees if, as many scientists expect, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide double in the next 100 years.

Almost half a century has passed since he wrote criticism regularly -- he gave up his post as a reviewer for The Nation magazine in 1949 -- but he remains at once the most admired and excoriated writer on art, as much a touchstone of postwar American painting and sculpture as any of the painters and sculptors in whose circle he moved as an oracular presence.   Why is he still so potent a figure? The reasons are many; it is not simply that he backed the right horses, by identifying before others did the painter Jackson Pollock and the sculptor David Smith as the ones on which America should stake its claim to artistic primacy after the war. He did back them, strongly and effectively, and even at the risk of a certain critical inconsistency.
