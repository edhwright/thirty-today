A sleeper hit in Germany, this wry, energetic first feature also travels well, bristling with a funny insouciance that makes sense anywhere.   The awkwardly titled \"Making Up!\" (originally titled \"Abge schminkt!\") is actually a short, sweet vignette about courtship rituals, with an emphasis on the heroines' Cosmo-girl wiliness about men. Mingling love and work, it begins with a creative crisis for Frenzy (Katja Riemann), a cartoonist who is short on material for her popular character, a foxy little feminine insect.   \"You try coming up with funny things from your everyday life,\" she complains. So for inspiration, she borrows the exploits of Maischa (Nina Kronjager), her best friend, who is a flirty nurse. Maischa is the foxier and more predatory of the two, but Frenzy turns out to be the one who finds romantic adventure.   The plot is slender, consisting of little more than Maischa's efforts to land a handsome stranger while foisting one of his friends upon a reluctant Frenzy. But onto this sketchy structure, Ms. von Garnier loads plenty of rueful observations about the dating game. Even though Maischa's boy-crazy outlook, plus some emphasis on cold cream and eyelash curlers, threatens to make the film feel retrograde, the director's attitudes remain enjoyably fresh. Her outlook is also sharply feminine, as when it comes to depicting miserable sex or the maneuvers that go with waiting for the phone to ring.   In a film that runs just under an hour, Ms. von Garnier shows a sure command of her subject matter and a bright comic style. Her film has commercial polish, and it also has two likable performances from its stars. Ms. Kronjager is a particularly promising comic actress, with a game, savvy manner that makes her no man's plaything. Her character's tireless self-involvement is also amusing, as when she studies her handsome dinner companion and muses (in voice-over): \"Those eyelashes! Two tons of mascara and I can't get mine to look like that.\"   As the story progresses, it yields a little surprise as Frenzy, not Maischa, winds up lovelorn. And Maischa tries to reassure her. \"Think of all the work you got done,\" Maischa says. \"Feeling bad must be good for you.\"   \"You're saying men who aren't around make you creative?\" Frenzy asks. Not even Maischa is saying that, but \"Making Up!\" does have some legitimate wisdom to pass along.   On the same bill is \"The Coriolis Effect,\" a 25-minute short about two male friends, which was previously reviewed as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series. At that time, Caryn James, writing in The New York Times, called it \"a fresh, self-assured film about sexual jealousy, dangerous living and the afterlife, with a nod to 'The Wizard of Oz.' \" MAKING UP!   Directed and edited by Katja von Garnier; written by Ms. von Garnier, Benjamin Taylor and Hannes Jaenicke; director of photography, Torsten Breuer; music by Peter Wenke and Tillmann Hohn; production design, Irene Edenhofer and Nikolai Ritter; produced by Ewa Karlstrom; released by Seventh Art Releasing.

The address from the Oval Office was meant to convince Americans that the nation has a legitimate national security interest in Haiti worth the risking of American lives. Indeed, Haiti does raise troubling concerns. But concerns and security interests are not the same thing, no matter how hard a President argues.   The fact remains that a Haiti invasion is a mission the country does not believe in, Congress has not approved and Mr. Clinton himself tried to avoid. Even now he is considering the dispatch of a special envoy to deliver one last warning. Perhaps Haiti's dictators will leave and allow the President to end his invasion plans without embarrassment. If not, it falls to Congress to somehow deter him from moving ahead despite so much dissent and sound counsel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940916","headline":"Police in Counseling Give Up Privacy Rights","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/opinion/l-police-in-counseling-give-up-privacy-rights-261106.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The deaths by suicide of two New York City police officers leave many in shock, sadness and frustration (news article, Sept. 8).

The term block party, however, is a bit misleading. It is, in fact, a neighborhood party. This year 93 museums, nonprofit institutions and galleries, primarily in SoHo, are holding simultaneous openings from 5 to 8 P.M. Participants include Brooke Alexander, Artists Space, the Drawing Center, Fawbush, David Zwirner, the Guggenheim Museum SoHo, the Dia Center for the Arts, Pace Gallery and Sonnabend. In addition, performance art may be seen throughout the day at the alternative space at 45 Greene Street. Changes in the Neighborhood    Those strolling SoHo tomorrow will notice changes over the summer. For starters, two galleries have moved into 40 Wooster Street, across from the Drawing Center. After five years at 594 Broadway, Michael Klein has moved to 40 Wooster Street's ground floor. \"We outgrew the space,\" Mr. Klein said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940916","headline":"1894: Anarchist Plot?: IN OUR PAGES:100,75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/opinion/IHT-1894-anarchist-plot-in-our-pages10075-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"BERLIN - During the visit of the Emperor to Marienburg a number of Anarchist placards were discovered posted up in various parts of the town.

In a new variation for the ever-changing international drug trade, the authorities said, the pizzeria gang didn't just import cocaine from Colombia to feed New York City's big appetite for drugs.

It was the most devastating toll for any U.S. carrier in seven years, and its cause is still a mystery. The chief of the Federal investigators on the scene offers the most sensible comment so far: Don't jump to conclusions about what went wrong.   It was U.S. Air's fifth fatal crash in as many years -- none similar to the others -- and its second in just three months. Given the airline's string of financial losses, there has been speculation it might have cut back on aircraft maintenance. That can happen when an airline is strapped for cash. But a reputation for safety is key to financial recovery, and U.S. Air insists there have been no cutbacks. Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration stepped up its surveillance of U.S. Air operations after the earlier crashes, and has pronounced those operations satisfactory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940916","headline":"Assault Weapons Ban Just Won't Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/16/opinion/l-assault-weapons-ban-just-won-t-work-260967.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   President Clinton has now signed the crime bill (front page, Sept. 14).

Treadwell has recovered from back spasms that sidelined him Thursday and is expected to play Sunday against the visiting Washington Redskins.   The Giants' kicking game is coming off a down Sunday, and they must contend with the Redskins' special teams, which are hot. One of the big reasons Washington was able to hammer New Orleans, 38-24, last week was the play of Brian Mitchell, a punt and kickoff returner. Mitchell, a five-year veteran out of Southwestern Louisiana, returned a punt 76 yards for a touchdown and also raced 86 yards with a kickoff to set up another score. In all, Mitchell had 225 yards in returns. He was named the National Football Conference's special teams player of the week.   What worries the Giants is how Mitchell was untouched on his touchdown run and on the kickoff return. No Saints player got a hand on him until the end of the play. Whether the Saints' special teams are that bad or the Redskins' that good remains to be seen. Giants Coach Dan Reeves says he thinks he knows the answer: Washington is that good.   Reeves gives a lot of the credit to the Redskins' special teams coach, Pete Rodriguez, who is considered to be one of the best in the business. Everywhere Rodriguez has coached, the special teams have always been special. In 1992, when he was with the Cardinals, the special teams were always rated No. 1 or among the best in the National Football League. That season, he was named special teams coach of the year by the N.F.L. Under Rodriguez, punter Rich Camarillo and returner Johnny Bailey made the Pro Bowl.   When Rodriguez was with the Raiders in 1988-89, Tim Brown made the Pro Bowl by leading the league in kickoff returns. The Raiders were also among the top three in both kickoff returns and punt coverage.   \"Pete Rodriguez does a super job,\" said Reeves. \"He was great when he was in Phoenix and now he does a great job.   \"Norv Turner is a big part of that, too,\" Reeves added about the Redskins' first-year head coach and former Cowboys assistant, \"because Dallas had great special teams. Our guys have to match that.\"   Against the Cardinals, Giants punter Mike Horan averaged just 30.6 yards and one attempt was blocked. The left-footed punter probably had one of his poorest performances in his 11-year career.   \"I've been around Mike now for a lot of years,\" said Reeves, who coached Horan in Denver for eight years before bringing him to the Giants last season. \"That's the worst night he ever had kicking the football. He's bounced back in the past and we expect him to bounce back again.\" Players Go, but Rivalries Stay    Despite the massive player movement brought about by free agency, rivalries still remain strong. The Redskins and the Giants will probably be that way no matter which players are on the field. Dan Reeves said the reason is simple.   \"I think my experience is that with teams competing for a division, the rivalry just gets bigger,\" said the Giants coach.   The Giants have played the Redskins more times (122 regular-season meetings) than any other opponent, followed by Philadelphia (119) and Arizona (103). The Giants and the Redskins have played each other at least twice a season since 1932 except in 1967 and 1969 when the two teams met once.   Reeves knows something about this rivalry and also about the Giants-Dallas rivalry when he was a player with the Cowboys. Reeves was asked what he thought about the Giants going back to their old uniforms on Sunday, as part of the N.F.L.'s Throwbacks Weekend. The outfit features the \"NY\" on the helmets, instead of \"Giants.\"   \"We used to beat them bad when they had those uniforms,\" said Reeves. Good Luck With the Chuck    Maybe the biggest rules change to affect teams is the 5-yard chuck, where defensive backs cannot touch a wide receiver 5 yards past the line of scrimmage.   The Giants have responded by moving their defensive backs closer to the line of scrimmage and telling them to make sure they get a hand on the receiver within the first 5 yards to disrupt the pattern.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940917","headline":"Knicks Lose Harper to Bulls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-lose-harper-to-bulls.html","abstract":"  Ron Harper, who had been pursued by the Knicks, signed with the Chicago Bulls last night.

But Bosnia is the only case where punitive sanctions are being applied against the victim.   The embargo is not without precedent. In October 1935, the United States imposed an arms embargo against both Italy and Ethiopia (the well-armed aggressor and the under-armed victim). This Presidential action, supported by Congress, was supposed to impede the spread of war. Instead, it encouraged aggression, first in Spain and then Germany. The arms embargo on Ethiopia, and related failed policies, led to the loss of half a million American lives within the decade.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940917","headline":"Hotel Workers Lift Strike Threat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/nyregion/hotel-workers-lift-strike-threat.html","abstract":"  Just five hours before a 6 P.M. deadline yesterday, Atlantic City hotel operators and union negotiators reached a tentative labor agreement, lifting the threat of a strike that could have halted the annual boardwalk parade of contestants in the Miss America pageant.

Warnke, an Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Johnson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940917","headline":"Derivatives Funds Mull New Changes in Strategy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/your-money/IHT-derivatives-funds-mull-new-changes-in-strategy.html","abstract":"MOST FUTURES FUNDS need trends to trade profitably, but trends have been few and far between in this year's financial markets. .Those patterns that did appear, moreover, have tended to work against traders.

year. Now he threatens to sabotage open trade -- by blocking approval of the international trade accord the Administration signed last April in Marrakesh, Morocco. That is an odd stance for the leader of the party that has traditionally stood for free trade. But Mr. Dole appears more intent on humiliating President Clinton before the November elections than on serving the nation's 250 million other citizens. The danger is that U.S. delay encourages protectionists abroad who desperately search for any excuse to sidetrack ratification of free trade.   The Administration bears some blame for Mr. Dole's chokehold. It waited too long to make a key concession. There are only about 20 working days left before Congress breaks for elections; the time crunch puts Mr. Dole in charge. He can say that he wants a trade pact this year -- mollifying his big-business and farm constituencies that have the most to gain from the Marrakesh accord -- while dallying so that the legislation dies from neglect.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"On Sunday; Behind a Bar, A Mellow Eye On the World","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/nyregion/on-sunday-behind-a-bar-a-mellow-eye-on-the-world.html","abstract":"  THE Fox was at the door, opening up the neighborhood bar in Queens Village where the previous night's dankness hovered within like a brooding, boozy ghost.

As one of the premiere exponents of Butoh, Japan's dominant experimental dance style, Hakutobo flaunts the slow movements, grotesque grimaces and underlying sense of desolation associated with that form.

Individually, the works have been heard many times, and the second overture has become a mini-warhorse under its more familiar title, \"Carnival.\" But the Philharmonic last performed the three together, under Anton Seidl, in 1895, three years after the American premiere, led by Dvorak himself at Carnegie Hall.   The curious history of these overtures raises questions involving everything from the nature of multimovement works and program music to issues of taste and reception. They were written in 1891 as a single large work with a single opus number. Dvorak was celebrating his 50th birthday to much acclaim, and he clearly wished to make a major statement, perhaps even to rival his venerable compatriot Bedrich Smetana.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"U.N.

But the painting's success, writes Barbara Haskell, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, was Stella's albatross. \"Heralded as 'the most successful piece of American modernism,' \" she writes in JOSEPH STELLA (Whitney Museum of American Art/Abrams, $60), \"it was also cited as an achievement Stella never surpassed.\" Inspired by Walt Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe and Hart Crane, Stella imbued his Futurist paintings with spiritual significance; he was also, Ms. Haskell writes, \"alone among the Futurists in aligning the subject matter of technological life to a style that encapsulated the dynamism and speed which technology engendered.\" Stella was always an outsider, even in the artistic community, and in the early 1920's he turned away from New York and from modernism, spending most of the rest of his life in Europe. There he executed paintings of symbolic landscapes and religious images that would dominate his work until his death -- work that was largely ignored. Indeed, one critic argued that it was easy to agree Stella had talent, but not so easy to agree on the use he made of it. What is clear, however, from this richly illustrated book is Stella's versatility: the superb draftsmanship of his early sketches of Ellis Island immigrants, the famous Futurist paintings, the fine collages never exhibited during his lifetime, as well as the later landscape and religious paintings. As Ms. Haskell concludes, \"It is perhaps only now, in a post-modernist era, that the baroque exuberance and unrestrained theatricality of Stella's art can be fully understood and embraced.\" Her elegantly and persuasively written book makes one hope so.\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Holy Bull Romps by 5 Lengths in a Bid to Be No. 1","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/sports/horse-racing-holy-bull-romps-by-5-lengths-in-a-bid-to-be-no-1.html","abstract":"  In a smashing performance that ended his racing year and may have won two championships in less than two minutes, Holy Bull dazzled a field of seven all-star rivals at Belmont Park yesterday as he swept to a five-length victory over Devil His Due in the Woodward Stakes.

Still, the great Gauguin retrospective of 1988 and a number of other recent shows have helped dispel this popular myth a little. The fact is that Gauguin became Gauguin not among the sun-drenched Polynesians but earlier, among the Bretons, back in France, where natives do their fishing in the icy North Atlantic.   The history of 19th-century art in France is dotted with stories of painters who thrived in small towns near the sea -- Seurat at Gravelines, Monet at Etretat. For Gauguin it was Pont-Aven, a picturesque Brittany port. In 1886, when he first arrived, it had a population of 1,500, a number of them artists who, like him, had come to admire the rugged landscape, live cheaply and soak up exotic local color.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/arts/c-correction-247944.html","abstract":"  An article on Aug. 28 about a new design by the architect Frank Israel for the Fine Arts Building on the University of California's Riverside campus misidentified the city in which Boora Architects has its head office.

Strong took over as director of the Queens Borough Public Library. As State Librarian of California for the last 14 years, Mr. Strong oversaw a system that carried books in 100 languages. Last week, Mr. Strong sat for an interview at the Flushing Library. Here are some of his comments. Q.  In what new ways will the Queens Library serve its members?  A.  We want to be sure that every branch is an on-ramp onto the information superhighway so that people can use the libraries from home computers, from schools, from offices or in the library itself -- that they have access equitably with all the people across the United States. Many people can't purchase home computers, or don't have that capability at their workplace. If you're a student who can't afford a computer, you're also disenfranchised. So the library can be a common ground, a leveling influence. Q.  How will you start doing this specifically?  A.  We will initially train our staff to do that surfing, getting around the Internet, getting the answers in, very likely in the same way we've delivered them to the public before. Our on-line catalog, as we bring that out throughout the entire system over the next several years, will have an Internet connection in it, so that someone using our on-line catalogue can not only find out what is available in our collection but will have access to our resources in CD-ROM, and other connections that will definitely emerge. Q.  What problems do you encounter when a library tries to serve a community as diverse as Queens?  A.First and foremost, we're developing collections in many languages other than English -- and collections that represent not only the popular new material in those languages but the classics that stand up along Shakespeare, Milton and Chaucer. . . . One of things I've learned over the years is that people come to a library, particularly a new user, with very different backgrounds. The Russian population comes with a strong tradition of public library service. . . . Someone coming from a Central American country or other third world countries -- while there may have been libraries, they were often for the elite and educated in society. The practice in those countries is also that you don't borrow anything . . . because books are so scarce or because the contents of books were so controlled by the regimes in power. . . . So an initial step is to show how we use a public library in Queens.

The fish form that he has used in several projects, Gehry told the historian Thomas Hines, owes something to his childhood memory of gefilte fish, and of the live carp, soaking in the family bathtub, from which his grandmother prepared it. And for some years now the architect has paid homage to his native country by devoting weekend mornings to ice hockey sessions with his sons. Gehry's new Anaheim Ice Rink, which goes into construction this week, is thus a kind of symbolic architectural homecoming for this transplanted child of the north.   But skating itself, John Cheever observed, can feel like a homecoming, precisely because it cuts the skater loose from roots. In \"Oh What a Paradise It Seems,\" Cheever writes about watching a group of skaters \"completely absorbed in the illusion that fleetness and grace were in their possession and had only to be revealed.\" On the ice, gravity is suspended; minimal exertion produces maximum propulsion. Perhaps no other sport is so viscerally analogous to freedom, and the exhilaration it induces springs from the sensation that this freedom is a natural state of being. The act of holding the body upright puts the whole world in balance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Sheila Delaney, Anthony DiNota","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/style/weddings-sheila-delaney-anthony-dinota.html","abstract":"  Sheila Kathleen Delaney, an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, was married yesterday to Anthony Stephen DiNota, a staff lawyer in the Bronx office of the civil division of the Legal Aid Society.

Murphy was growing up on Staten Island, he used to shoot hoops in the backyard of his grandfather's clapboard house on Bowen Street. His grandfather was a retired New York City police sergeant, and he lived across the street from a field where a dozen red-brick apartment buildings went up in the 1960's.   It was in that federally subsidized housing complex, the Park Hill Houses, that Ernest Sayon, a 22-year-old black man, died in April in a struggle with police officers, touching off a week of protests and allegations of police brutality.   Now, Mr. Murphy is conducting a grand jury investigation to determine whether the police officers behaved properly or exerted undue force and should be charged with a crime.   The case is the biggest test Mr. Murphy has faced in his 11 years in the post, historically the least prominent of the five district attorneys' offices in the city. As a sign of the tensions surrounding the case, he has been accused of delaying the grand jury proceedings to prevent a decision during the hot days of the summer.   Mr. Murphy said that he expected to hear from about 100 witnesses, altogether, and that a conclusion is still weeks away.   Although the proceedings are secret, many witnesses have publicly given conficting accounts of what happened, and Mr. Murphy said that so far the jury did not appear to be leaning one way or the other. \"We're all over the lot,\" he said in his office overlooking New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty.   The case is being played out on an unlikely terrain. Quieter, smaller and more bucolic than the other boroughs, Staten Island has the city's smallest percentage of minority residents -- although it is growing -- and the highest percentage of police officers. Crime has been rising, and some old-timers blame the growing minority population for the deterioration.   Although the two main figures in the fatal struggle, Mr. Sayon and Officer Donald Brown, are black, the death of Mr. Sayon has taken on racial overtones, and some Park Hill residents urged that a special prosecutor be appointed.   State law required that the 23-member grand jury hearing the Sayon case be drawn from a pool that reflects the population mix of the community. And for many people, that suggests a fundamental bias on Staten Island. \"This is a white borough,\"' said Jerome X. O'Donovan, one of Staten Island's three City Council members, all of whom are white.   \"There are also lots of cops out here, and there's a perception that, for those reasons, the process won't be fair,\" added Mr. O'Donovan, whose district includes the Park Hill Houses. \"Bill Murphy understands the perception and, if anything, he's going to do a very thorough job because of that.\"   Others are not so sure. Chrisida Howard, the president of the Park Hill Tenants' Association, said her affection for the borough had been tempered by searing experiences of racial prejudice, and she said she was far from certain that the grand jury would render an impartial decision. \"My hope, my dream,\" she said, \"is that we do get justice.\"   But she added: \"I can't know that we will. It is just my hope and my dream.\"   Mr. Murphy's experience with grand juries goes back to his youth, when his father, an accountant, was repeatedly called as a grand juror. It was his father's dinner-table accounts of the proceedings, Mr. Murphy said, that first gave him the idea that he might find satisfaction in a career in the law. Over the years, Mr. Murphy has become such an authority on grand juries that he conducts classes on them for young lawyers.   He acknowledges that prosecutors greatly influence grand juries because they conduct the proceeding, question all witnesses and explain the legal choices, all without the participation of lawyers with opposing arguments. But he says the courthouse cliche that a prosecutor could persuade a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich is ridiculous.   \"We don't seek a conclusion nor direct a conclusion.\" Mr. Murphy said. \"We tell the grand jury what they may consider and what their options are. But what they do is their decision.\"   Although Mr. Murphy is directing the grand jury investigation, evidence is being presented to the panel by the chief of his investigations bureau, Mario Mattei.   Mr. Sayon, whom neighbors described as a small-time drug dealer, died on the balmy evening of April 29 after members of a special drug unit forced him to the ground, face down, and cuffed his hands behind his back. The police had gone to the Park Hill Houses looking for another man wanted on drug charges. They were startled by an explosion, which later turned out to have been caused by a firecracker, and confronted Mr. Sayon, who was then on probation on charges of drug possession and resisting arrest.   Mr. Murphy heard the widely divergent accounts as to whether Mr. Sayon struggled with the officers and decided that a grand jury would have to sort out what had happened. The New York City Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, ruled that Mr. Sayon's death was a homicide caused by pressure on his neck and chest. The central question for the grand jury is whether the officers' action was justified.   Trying to ease the tensions caused by the killing, Guy V. Molinari, the borough president, has been meeting on Thursday nights with leaders from the Park Hill Houses in a group that calls itself Ambassadors for Peace. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton have met with the Ambassadors several times, and through the group Mr. Molinari has been reaching out to the thousands of Park Hill residents.   Hattie Smith-Davis, a registered nurse and Pentecostal minister in her late 60's who is one of the Ambassadors, said the meetings have shown good faith and have helped bring the community together.   \"I don't believe they would be meeting with us if they did not really and truly want peace,\" Ms. Smith-Davis said.   Mr. Murphy has been criticized by Park Hill residents and civil libertarians for permitting the long summer recess for the grand jury. Some charged that he deliberately delayed the proceedings to avoid any possible confrontation over a conclusion reached during the summer. Others said the reason was that witnesses' memories would fade as time passed, to the benefit of the police.   But Mr. Murphy said he had no choice because many jurors had previously scheduled vacations. \"There was no design to delay the grand jury's determination,\" he said. \"We simply couldn't get them together during the period of the summer.\"   Victoria Shuford, a member of a Park Hill Tenants' Association who came to Staten Island as a child in the early 1970's from Newark, N.J., said many are concerned about the composition of the grand jury, which, citing the secrecy of the proceedings, Mr. Murphy refused to discuss. Some of those who have testified say the grand jury is nearly all white.   \"The people here don't feel the grand jury can make the proper decisions,\" Ms. Shuford said, \"because they don't really know what goes on in Park Hill,\" where nearly everyone is black.   Christine Lee, a 22-year-old former cashier and photographer's assistant who has been disabled since her back was accidentally broken by police officers who knocked her off her feet as they were chasing a suspect in the Park Hill Houses three years ago, testified before the grand jury in June. She said she felt that both the prosecutor and at least one of the jurors, a white woman, were hostile and tried to intimidate her.   \"He was twisting words around,\" Ms. Lee said of the prosecutor. She said she saw only one black person among the grand jurors and was not sure if there were any Hispanic jurors or members of other minority groups.   Over the years, Staten Island has been a magnet for New York City police officers, including Mr. Murphy's grandfather, William L. Murphy Sr. The District Attorney said that before he was born his grandfather had retired from the police force, so he never saw him in uniform and they never talked about the force. He is proud of his grandfather's work as a police officer, Mr. Murphy said, but he said it would not affect his attitude toward the officers before the grand jury.   \"My pride in the police in my background means that all I'm looking for is someone who can measure up to what I picture my grandfather to be,\" Mr. Murphy said, \"and that was a good and honest cop.\"   The Police Department says 3,785 officers live on Staten Island, and Mr. Murphy says they are a substantial factor in Staten Island's tranquillity.   It is also a reason that some Park Hill residents feel a Staten Island grand jury is likely to look at a police officer's problems with a great deal of understanding.   But Mr. Murphy has confidence in the grand jury process.   \"It is virtually impossible to thwart the grand jury's ability to reach a fair conclusion,\" he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"HOME CLINIC;\nSpecific Tools for Specific Tasks Are a Major Step for Safety","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/nyregion/home-clinic-specific-tools-for-specific-tasks-are-a-major-step-for.html","abstract":"HAND-held tools are not necessarily easy to use.

That series, \"American Maniacs,\" has helped make Mickey and Mallory pop-star murderers. Now Mickey turns on the reporter and speaks the truest lines in Oliver Stone's film.  He says: \"Killing you and what you represent is a statement. I'm not exactly 100 percent sure of what it's saying.\" But it's a statement, all right.    It wouldn't be fair to reveal whether Mickey pulls the trigger on Wayne, but his confusion about what the trash-TV reporter represents is a perfect reflection of the film's own problems. \"Natural Born Killers\" seems to say something about the insidious influence of the media -- tabloids and celebrity journalism in print as well as on television. Yet under its entertaining flash-and-dazzle surface, the film's statement is \"TV can be a bad influence.\" No kidding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Lisa Goodrich, Eamon O'Neill","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/style/weddings-lisa-goodrich-eamon-o-neill.html","abstract":"  Lisa Vaughn Goodrich, a daughter of Robert and Nancy Goodrich of Concord, Mass., was married there yesterday to Eamon Gearoid O'Neill, a son of Liam and Therese O'Neill of Killiney, County Dublin, Ireland.

Once a 20-foot-deep, eight-acre expanse of water, Mirror Lake is naturally turning into a marsh. Now it is a lake only in spring, when a foot of water from melted snow covers several acres.   The $200,000 restoration was developed by national park officials and the nonprofit Yosemite Fund. The Chevron Corporation contributed the funds and arranged for 500 of its employees to participate in the restoration of the lake and the surrounding 100 acres. The first stage will begin this fall with the gathering of seeds and cuttings for propagation, and the rebuilding of a loop trail round the lake.    During the project, the area will not be closed but the trail system will be redirected to minimize foot traffic in some areas. One of the main goals of the project, said Frank Dean, assistant to the park superintendent, \"is to remove a spider web of trails that crisscrosses the lake bed.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Catherine Devine, George Moore Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/style/weddings-catherine-devine-george-moore-jr.html","abstract":"  Catherine Marie Devine, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth P.

Neighborhood legend has it that one Black Disciples leader beat his own brother to the ground for violating the rules.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Where Tokyo's Young Crowd Likes to Eat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/travel/choice-tables-where-tokyo-s-young-crowd-likes-to-eat.html","abstract":"  TWENTY is the age of majority throughout Japan; the age at which it's legal to drink, and to vote. Twenty-something in Japan means eclectic eating: Members of Japan's newest generation of business people and bureaucrats are as likely to gobble down a burger as they are to savor sushi. Most grab quick but filling lunches at midday, then join their co-workers and classmates for leisurely, though casual, eating and drinking in the evening. The more ambitious among the young professionals often return to the office after dinner, or accompany their superiors entertainingclients at fancy restaurants. Of course, dining at elegant, fashionable spots is very much a part of the dating scene.    As in industralized societies throughout the world, in Japan the daily diet of young professionals includes ample quantities of fast food. No doubt McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Denny's have changed the face of casual eating in Japan forever. But in the past year or so, a gentrified version of traditional Japanese street fare, called yatai mura (literally, \"village of street stalls\"), has also sprung up in Tokyo, and it is particularly popular with young people.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"Autumn Leaves From Another Perspective: New Hampshire;\nHikers Get Best Look At a Very Wide Choice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/travel/autumn-leaves-from-another-perspective-new-hampshire-hikers-get-best.html","abstract":"James Joyce once quipped, \"Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.\" A similar challenge would involve touring New Hampshire without glimpsing the woods.

The terrain around Matera is tufa, a calcareous composite that provided its inhabitants, as far back as the Neolithic Age, with grotto dwellings and easily excavated caves. Today, 8,000 years later, honeycombs of houses are carved into the rock in an arabesque of crudely shaped shelters and elegant homes.\n\nThe town of 55,000 is the second largest in Basilicata, a region of Italy that is sparsely populated, and where more than 90 percent of the terrain is hills or mountains. At 1,300 feet, Matera rises from a ravine, and its cave homes, or \"sassi,\" swarm up two slopes. The houses -- set off by tiny piazzas, courtyards and cantinas -- are layered one on top of another, tangled along the face of the bluff in an intricate web. Houses fold into each other, as the roof of one becomes another's floor or neighborhood sidewalk. Facades have been added to the fronts of the cave homes, providing the illusion of traditional architecture.  Although plumbing and electricity are modern additions, for hundreds of years Materans used a system of cisterns carved into the rock to collect rainwater. At night it is easy to see which of the ancient structures are currently occupied. Seen from Piazza San Pietro, on the edge of the sassi, lights shine through doorways and windows, filling the tenebrous streets with an eerie glow.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"The Granddaddy Of Disorder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/arts/art-the-granddaddy-of-disorder.html","abstract":"  THE SUMMER HAS BEEN STIFLING, too hot, Cy Twombly said, for painting, too full of distraction and diversion.

The preparations were for Mr. Twombly's largest American retrospective ever, opening next Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. It will include 50 paintings, 37 works on paper and 10 sculptures, embracing his entire career, from 1946 to a few weeks ago. Twombly's is not a household name in the United States, although he gained a certain notoriety when one of his works was singled out by Morley Safer during an attack on modern art on \"60 Minutes\" last year as a \"canvas of scrawls done with the wrong end of a paintbrush.\" On the other hand, those deceptively childlike scrawls have earned him many devoted followers among artists, critics and collectors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940918","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/sports/results-plus-278963.html","abstract":"  TENNIS  Ivanisevic Reaches Final in Romania  Top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic defeated Renzo Furlan, 6-4, 6-4, yesterday to move into the final of the Romanian Open, a clay-court tournament in Bucharest.

Mr. Eells was born in Oakland, Calif., and moved at the age of 5 to England, where his father taught math at Warwick University. He has a degree from York University and diplomas in conducting and the French horn from the Royal Academy of Music in London; he has also studied with Seiji Ozawa and Andre
