Of course, \"The Simpsons\" isn't just any cartoon. It also happens to be one of the most inventive and cheekiest romps on prime time. Lending one's voice to the animation has become a prestige stint, and tonight's season finale, on Fox at 8, sets a record with a lineup that includes Johnny Carson, Hugh Hefner, Bette Midler, Luke Perry, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Elizabeth Taylor.   Actually, in this instance the Simpson family largely plays second banana to Krusty the Clown, the irrepressible performer whose hoary routines cloak an effusively mean-spirited heart. He's young Bart's favorite television comic, notwithstanding some nasty business in the past about a summer-camp scam. This evening, in \"Krusty Gets Kanceled,\" the veteran performer runs up against some fierce competition in the form of a ventriloquist's dummy named Gabbo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"ITALIAN EXECUTIVE FACES GRAFT CASE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/world/italian-executive-faces-graft-case.html","abstract":"  The head of the biggest Italian public corporation, with interests from banks and supermarkets to the national airline Alitalia, was arrested on corruption charges today as the 15-month-old bribery investigation pressed deeper into the vast state industries.

Searching for a key to unlock this awesome poetic drama, the director finds it in Peer's childhood fantasies, the dreams that he shares with his mother. To a background of trolls and international intrigue, the title character acts out one man's lifelong quest for spiritual self-awareness.   Coming after Mr. Bergman's highly politicized \"Hamlet\" and his revelatory season of Strindberg, Ibsen and O'Neill at the Brooklyn Academy, \"Peer Gynt\" reaffirms his position in the pantheon of experimental theater artists. In his 70's he retains a youthful brashness. His \"Peer Gynt\" is a fabulistic folk tale filled with visual richness and an ebullient sense of comedy. His first production of the play in 1957 was apparently stark and simple. It starred Max von Sydow, who had recently appeared in \"The Seventh Seal,\" which might have been considered a cinematic companion piece.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"Sin or Not, Supposed Relic Of Cross Is Sold in France","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/world/sin-or-not-supposed-relic-of-cross-is-sold-in-france.html","abstract":"  Despite warnings by a Vatican official that it is a sin to trade in relics, two slivers of olive wood said to come from the cross on which Jesus was crucified were sold for more than $18,000 in a crowded auction house here today.

The sale totaled $48.5 million, slightly above Christie's low estimate of $45 million, but well below its high estimate of $59 million. Of the 60 works for sale, 48 found buyers. While the figures didn't compare with Sotheby's Impressionist sale on Tuesday night, which totaled $75.9 million, Christie's, anticipating less of a success, was ecstatic.  Well Over Expectations    \"There was more bidding than we've seen in a long time,\" said Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in New York. \"Nine lots sold for over $1 million. We did better than we could have possibly expected.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"Sports of The Times; 'No Telling Where He's Coming From'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/sports/sports-of-the-times-no-telling-where-he-s-coming-from.html","abstract":"  HIS sneakers are almost as big as he is.

These fears could well be overblown, but 3.5 million Puerto Ricans are owed a better demonstration that Treasury Department mandarins have responsibly done their homework.    President Clinton has endorsed, and Congress is weighing, a Treasury proposal to amend Section 936 of the tax code that gives U.S. companies an exemption from Federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico. This tax break, which extends to interest on local bank deposits, is seen in Washington as an excessive giveaway whose prudent trimming can yield $7 billion over five years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"One Less Thing to Believe In: Fraud at Fake Cash Machine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/nyregion/one-less-thing-to-believe-in-fraud-at-fake-cash-machine.html","abstract":"  This is a tale of audacity, high-tech thievery and, to no small degree, loss of innocence. For it seems that even the lowly automated teller machine, so common as to be almost invisible in malls and marketplaces everywhere, is not always to be trusted.   For two weeks, an ATM machine -- ordinary-looking in just about every way, but completely bogus -- operated in a shopping mall near here, giving nothing but apologetic receipts that said no transactions were possible. Meanwhile, police investigators and bank officials say, the machine was recording the card numbers and the personal identification numbers that hundreds of customers entered in their vain attempts to make the machine dispense cash. Let the Fraud Begin    Starting late last Friday in Manhattan, while the machine was still running at the Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester, the first withdrawals began. Using counterfeit bank cards encoded with the numbers stolen from Connecticut customers, the thieves strolled through midtown Manhattan, tapping into the 24-hour automated teller network, and netting, by today, at least $50,000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"U.N.

The observers would check all traffic moving across the frontier from Mr. Milosevic's Serbian republic into Bosnia to check on Belgrade's enforcement of its pledge to send only goods such as food and medicine to the Bosnian Serbs and to deny them fuel and military goods. Earlier this week Serbian officials in Belgrade said they would cooperate with such inspections. Latest Security Council Move    The border monitoring plan, which is likely to be approved next week, represents the latest move in the Security Council's tactic of using its economic blockade against the Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro to force President Milosevic to press Bosnia's Serbs into accepting the peace plan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"Ex-Panthers Lose Retrial Motion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/nyregion/ex-panthers-lose-retrial-motion.html","abstract":"  Three former Black Panthers who were convicted of murdering two New York police officers in 1971 are not entitled to a new trial, a Federal judge ruled yesterday, despite his conclusion that important evidence was withheld from the defense and that a prosecution witness had lied.

Many places prepare them exceptionally well: Bridge Cafe, 279 Water Street, (212) 227-3344, Chin Chin, 216 East 49th Street, (212) 888-4555, Manhattan Ocean Club, 57 West 58th Street, (212) 371-7777, and One Fifth Avenue, 1 Fifth Avenue, (212) 529-1515, to name just a few.   One of the most sensational versions tasted this year is at Lespinasse, in the St. Regis Hotel, at 2 East 55th Street, (212) 339-6719. The inventive chef, Gray Kunz, who is a master at melding flavors of East and West, has come up with a most unlikely soft-shell crab recipe, one that is as vivid as it is surprising.    He uses medium-size crabs. \"You make sure they are fresh by running your finger across their head to see if they move,\" Mr. Kunz said. He then coats the shell side with a combination of egg yolk, flour and -- \"You won't believe this,\" he says -- Cream of Wheat. Mr. Kunz explains that the cereal adds a crunchy texture and, for some reason, prevents burning when the crabs are cooked in hot oil. The crabs are sauteed, Cream of Wheat side down, until crisp.   \"I then add a little butter to the pan, some shallots, lemon thyme, purple basil and garlic,\" Mr. Kunz said. The flavors permeate the crust wonderfully.   The crab is garnished with fried, pickled ramps (sort of a garlic chive) and frizzled julienne of celery root. This indulgence is not a bargain: $18 as an appetizer, $26 as a main course. But brilliance rarely is.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930514","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/14/arts/art-in-review-879093.html","abstract":"  Antonius Hockelmann   Michael Werner Gallery  21 East 67th Street  Manhattan  Through June 11    This impressive show is New York's first look at the art of Antonius Hockelmann, an eccentric German sculptor now in his mid-50's, who exhibited in Berlin and Cologne in the 1960's and early 70's before dropping out of the art scene.

The law allows the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detain those suspected of being criminals and national security risks to prevent entry into the United States. The solution to the anomalous situations in the bombing case is not to change immigration laws, but better coordination among Federal agencies and better administration of laws by the immigration agency and State Department.   To change a law that does not need changing, Senator Alan Simpson and Representative Bill McCollum have introduced bills to turn back asylum applicants arriving at airports who lack travel documents. These bills would preclude women and children from Bosnia who have been victims of rape, torture and ethnic cleansing from seeking refuge in the United States.

Robert and Susanna Scaretta, the owners of Revere Armored Inc. in Bohemia, L.I., have denied taking any money. But in Federal District Court in Uniondale this morning, two former employees of Revere and an accountant admitted that they had helped the Scarettas carry out their purported fraud. And a former vice president at National Westminster Bank said the Scarettas had paid him thousands of dollars to insure that his bank would continue to do business with Revere.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930515","headline":"Improbable.

The Kinks, some 30 years after coming together as a group, performed at the Academy on Thursday night. Here's what their lead singer and songwriter, Ray Davies, had to say after claiming that the induction of the band into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 had not affected it: \"We're more untogether than ever. Let's hear it for imperfection!\"   Sloppy, wild and mostly joyous, the Kinks mine amateurishness to the end of the vein; it may be just another rock routine, but the band pulls it off and makes it seem real.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930515","headline":"Agency Takes Step Toward Banning Whaling in Southern Ocean","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/15/world/agency-takes-step-toward-banning-whaling-in-southern-ocean.html","abstract":"  The International Whaling Commission today took the first step toward declaring one quarter of the world's oceans off limits to whaling, even if the current ban on whaling ends.

Aztec Hill, trained by Tom Bohannan and ridden by Mike Smith, who will handle Prairie Bayou on Saturday, made a stirring charge late in the homestretch to win by half a length.
