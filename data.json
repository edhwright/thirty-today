Heather Watts was not his muse, but he made her a soloist in 1978 and a principal in 1979. Like a good number of other dancers who supposedly did not fit the Balanchine mold (in this case, spiky, broad-shouldered and inconsistent in his classical style), she has actually been the kind of dancer to which Balanchine was especially attracted.

She, an Amazon molly fish, had sought copulation with a male, not to obtain his genes and mix them with her own to spawn the next generation, but simply for a quick chemical jump start. She needed his sperm to prod her eggs to split in twain and create clonal progeny, the fry all female and identical to the mother.    For his part, the male, a closely related species of molly fish that propagates through more normal channels of sexual reproduction, also appeared to benefit from the odd affair. As scientists showed last year, the male molly fish that copulates with an Amazon becomes immediately irresistible to the females of his own kind, who then hungrily mate with him and give his seed a chance to sire piscine multitudes. In this way, scientists proposed, a so-called gynogenetic species like the Amazon can persist, gaining the chemical prod of a male's sperm without giving him offspring in return. She merely made him sexy to other females, and that seemed motivation enough.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Chess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/arts/chess-136195.html","abstract":"  Moscow crime spoiled the recent World Chess Olympiad for many players and teams.

Dexter Scott King, 33, the youngest son among the four King children, has succeeded succeed her.   Speaking to nearly 400 people gathered at Ebenezer Baptist Church on the 10th annual observance of the King holiday to mark what would have been Dr. King's 66th birthday, Mrs. King said she saw reasons for hope as crises abated in places like Rwanda, Haiti and parts of the Middle East, even though civil strife continued in places like Nigeria, Bosnia and Russia.   \"The most positive development for the state of the dream worldwide since we last met has been the establishment of a great new democracy in South Africa,\" she said.   Domestically, she said, political leaders seemed focused on budget deficits when the nation had a serious \"compassion deficit.\" Nevertheless, Mrs. King said she was optimistic about the future as she left the leadership of the King center to write about her life after her husband's assassination and to pursue some \"long overdue\" musical projects that would put her conservatory training as a singer to use.   \"I am leaving this ship of hope in good hands,\" she said of her son.   Since taking over last month, Mr. King has been involved in a public dispute with the National Park Service over control of a main site in the King Historic District here and the right to construct a major memorial to his father.   Only oblique mention was made of that dispute today as some who have been critical of the King center in the dispute, like Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta, sat on the dais alongside King family members for the official observance of the holiday.   But a reminder of the dispute was just outside the door of the church and across the street. There stood the half-demolished hulk of the city's Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, which city officials have deeded to the National Park Service over the objections of the King family for the construction of an $11 million visitors' center. If completed, the center is likely to become the gateway to the historic district, setting the tone for an estimated three million visitors a year, and possibly eclipsing the King family's plans for a high-tech, interactive museum.   In a voice strikingly reminiscent of the cadence and phrasing of his father, Dexter King said that Dr. King was part of American history and \"belonged to everyone spiritually\" but that his family was the guardian of his legacy until his dream was fulfilled.   \"My father delivered political freedom and I would like to deliver economic freedom,\" Mr. King said, sketching a goal that he said the King center was likely to pursue under his leadership. \"Had his life not been cut short, I believe economic empowerment would have been the next step and the King center should be the catalyst in that goal,\" he said. \"I'm calling home all those freedom fighters who marched with my father. Dexter Scott King is going to be there with you this time, and we will make it to the promise land.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Is the Future of China in Deng's Iron Hand?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/opinion/l-is-the-future-of-china-in-deng-s-iron-hand-434495.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Deng's Daughter Opens a Long-Shut Door\" (front page, Jan. 13): In anticipating the passing of the ailing Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, some Beijing leaders summoned to see him recently were startled by the harshness of his final bits of advice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Woman Held In Drowning Of Two Sons Is Arraigned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/us/woman-held-in-drowning-of-two-sons-is-arraigned.html","abstract":"  Covering her eyes with her hands at the mention of her dead sons, Susan V.

Usually the source of the confusion is not hard to sort out: in the case of the mistaken breast cancer gene, biologists determined that what appeared to be a guilty mutation in the candidate gene was in fact a so-called polymorphism, a harmless variation in the chemical makeup of some people's DNA that had nothing to do with why one woman had familial breast cancer and another did not.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19950117","headline":"In Performance; DANCE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/arts/in-performance-dance-423995.html","abstract":"  Work on a Grand Scale In a Tiny Space  Colloquium Contemporary Dance Exchange Here    The lively South Village arts center known as Here has several spaces for performances and exhibitions.

Agencies are to be given until the year 2000 to find and set aside information that is still sensitive, such as weapons design or the identities of spies.

The company plans to operate the 92-year-old theater, once home to the Ziegfeld Follies, as a showplace for its own theatrical productions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950118","headline":"Italian Premier Lists Cabinet, Faces Warning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/18/world/italian-premier-lists-cabinet-faces-warning.html","abstract":"  As promised, Italy's new Prime Minister-designate, Lamberto Dini, appointed a Government of largely nonpartisan ministers today, but its chances of winning approval in Parliament quickly dimmed as his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, threatened to withhold support unless he pledges to move toward early national elections.

Dr. John Wood, an energetic and much admired surgeon, was on his dinner break at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center when three men tried to rob him on 168th Street. A single shot was fired. The doctor fell wounded, and 90 minutes later he died in the emergency room of the hospital where he was completing his residency.   More than 13 years have elapsed since that early November day in 1981, but still the consequences and emotions loosed by the stupid fury have not yet fully played themselves out.

Manhattan, which got 16 points apiece from Heshimu Evans and Ted Ellis against the Peacocks, is preparing for Saturday afternoon's clash with Siena (3-10) at Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, where last season, the Jaspers crushed the Saints in a regular-season game before more than 13,000 spectators.   \"Going into the first game of the season, we had no idea how good we were,\" said Fraschilla, whose team has reeled off four straight victories after a disappointing loss to Iona. \"After the Iona game, we took a good look at ourselves in the mirror. We weren't doing the things that people took notice of earlier in the season. We needed to get back to playing great team defense, playing with great intensity and enthusiasm and using our depth to win.\"   Despite getting his team back on a winning track, Fraschilla thinks there is still much room for improvement. \"We're only 70 percent of where we can be six weeks from now, so we just want to keep getting better,\" he said. \"I don't even think our kids realize that it's our best start in 40 years. We just have them focused on asking 'Who's next?' \"  Canisius  The Golden Griffins (9-6), who have defeated Cincinnati, Penn and North Carolina-Charlotte this season, pose the biggest threat to Manhattan in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Three big reasons for Canisius's strong play has been its frontline of Micheal Meeks, a 6-foot-8-inch junior center from Brampton, Ontario; Darrell Barley, a 6-5 junior forward from Rochester, and Craig Wise, a 6-4 forward from Philadelphia.   Meeks, who is leading the M.A.A.C. in scoring with an 18.4 average, is also hauling down 6.6 rebounds per game. Barley is the league's fourth-leading scorer at 16.5 points a game, and Wise is seventh over all, producing 14.9 points a game.   \"Great teams can have a bad day and still win. That won't happen at Canisius because we do not have that type of talent,\" said John Beilein, the Canisius coach. \"But if we do play well, we've shown we can play with anybody.\"   Canisius is preparing this week for Saturday's home game against St. Bonaventure (8-7).  St. Bonaventure   The Bonnies of the Atlantic 10 had lost 45 consecutive league road games until last week's 78-56 blowout of Duquesne. Oddly enough, St. Bonaventure's road hex, which began in February 1989, was ended on Friday the 13th.    \"I didn't know that,\" St. Bonaventure Coach Jim Baron said yesterday. \"We're getting better. It was a great effort on our part and I think our enthusiasm carried over from the Massachusetts game, which we lost in overtime. We set a goal for ourselves at the beginning of the year that we would win some road games in the league, and we got one.\"  Army   The Cadets (9-5), who are coming off an 89-82 upset of Patriot League-leading Holy Cross on Tuesday night, are off to their best start since the 1978-79 season. That season, the Cadets jumped out to an 11-3 start under a coach named Mike Krzyzewski.    \"We're real pleased with the victory over Holy Cross,\" said Army's current head coach, Dino Gaudio. \"We beat a very good team, and we were just fortunate at the end to pull it out.\"   Army, which next plays at Navy on Saturday afternoon, is led by Mark Leuking, the nation's third-leading scorer. Leuking, a 5-10 junior guard from Austin, Ind., who is averaging 26.8 points a game, had a team-high 24 points against Holy Cross.    \"We knew this was an important game as far as the season was concerned,\" said Leuking. \"Coach kept reminding us, kept drilling us how much we needed this game, but we were already prepared to play it.\"  Syracuse  Syracuse (13-1) has won 13 straight games, including Tuesday night's 91-87 victory over St. John's, a contest in which the Orangemen squandered almost all of a 19-point lead. Despite their winning streak and rise in the national polls, the Orangemen, who have lost big leads on several occasions this season, are not happy with their overall performance.   \"It's been shown the past couple of games that we don't have the killer instinct,\" said Lawrence Moten, who scored 21 points against the Red Storm. \"We have to want to stick the dagger in their hearts. We kind of let people back in the ball game. We can't be doing that.\"   The Orangemen, who have wasted big leads against Villanova and Pittsburgh, will be shooting for more consistency Saturday afternoon at Providence (10-3). Penn  After being routed by Massachusetts last week, the Quakers (9-2) returned the favor against La Salle on Tuesday night, hammering the Explorers, 90-71. Although Penn had six players in double-figure scoring, one of them was not the team's leading scorer, Jerome Allen, who finished with just 2 points on free throws and 6 turnovers.   \"Jerome Allen doesn't have to score for us to be effective,\" said Coach Fran Dunphy, whose team plays at St. Joseph's (8-4) on Saturday evening. \"He does so many other things well.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Johnson, 2 Other Jet Starters in Draft Pool","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/sports/pro-football-johnson-2-other-jet-starters-in-draft-pool.html","abstract":"  The Jets have exposed three starters -- including the high-priced running back Johnny Johnson -- to help fill the rosters of the Carolina Cougars and the Jacksonville Jaguars.
