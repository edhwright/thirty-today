Faster models typically have fast microprocessors, swift disk drives, special video cards and lots of fast cache memory to support them. Slower models get by with less, but do not cost as much.

He was betting that he could outscore his rivals against the field, and time after time he was proved right.   For a long time now, the Capablanca policy has been successfully used by strong players, principally by such cautious souls as Tigran Petrosian, the Soviet Armenian who was world champion from 1963 to 1969. Most recently it was put into effect by the Worcester, Mass., grandmaster Ilya Gurevich in the Winter Tournament of the Marshall Chess Club, at 23 West 10th Street. In this event, which ran from Jan. 31 to Feb. 13, Gurevich went undefeated in amassing the winning 8-3 score. Against his fellow grandmasters, he drew in 12 moves with Roman Dzindzichashvili of Queens and in 22 moves with John Fedorowicz of Manhattan. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . Country . . . Points . . .

Against the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defense with 3 Nd2, Klovsky adopted 3 . . . Nf6 to lure the white center on with 4 e5. Quite soon, he whittled down this bastion with 8 . . . f6 9 ef Nf6 which also gave him the mobility to defend his kingside.   After 10 Ne2, it may be that Black does not need 10 . . . Qc7. A reasonable alternative is 10 . . . Bd6 11 O-O O-O 12 Bf4 Bf4 13 Nf4 Ne4 14 Qc1 Ng5 15 Ng5 Qg5 16 Ne2 Qf6.   The plan underlying 10 . . . Qc7 is that after 11 . . . Bd6, White cannot exchange off his queen bishop against the black king bishop. The purpose is further served by 14 . . . Nh5, which prepares 15 Bg3 Ng3 16 hg, thus preserving the d6 bishop to guard the slightly weak dark squares.   Gurevich remarked that his 17 Nb6!? is a new move. On 17 . . . Ra7, the black queen rook is out of play, while after 17 . . . Rb8, Gurevich boldly snatched a pawn with 18 Ba6!?   Klovsky did not knuckle under with 18 . . . ba 19 Rc6, nor fall into 18 . . . Nb4 19 Bb5 Na2 20 Rc8 Rbc8 21 Nc8 Rc8 22 Qa4! Nb4 23 Bd7, which wins a decisive pawn and simultaneously unhinges the black position. He struck back with 18 . . . Nd4 19 Nd4 ba 20 Nc8 Rbc8 21 Rc8 Rc8, when 22 Ne6? would be crunched by 22 . . . Qe5!, winning a piece.   Still, Gurevich's analysis had gone a lot farther, as his 22 Re1! showed. After 22 . . . Bb4 (22 . . . e5? 23 Nf5! gf 24 Qd5 Qf7 25 Qd6 is overwhelming for White) 23 Qg4! Qf7 24 Rd1, there was no defense by 24 . . . Re8 because of 25 Ne6 Qe6 26 Qb4.   On 24 . . . Ng7 25 Ne6! Rc4 26 Nd4 Nf5, Gurevich coolly forced the game into a pawn-ahead ending with 27 b3 Rd4 28 Rd4 Nd4 29 Qd4.   After 38 Qb7!, there was no use for the Ukrainian to go on: 38 . . . Qg8 39 f4 Kh6 40 Qg7 Qg7 41 Bg7 Kg7 42 Kf2 brings about an elementary king-and-pawn ending; 38 . . . d4 39 Bd4 Qe1 40 Kg2 accomplishes nothing because Gurevich had precisely guarded against 40 . . .

He paces around the stage, slipping easily and impressively in and out of many voices, accents, walks and faces.

As golfers take to the green, tennis players to the courts, baseball players to the field, swimmers to the water and do-it-yourselfers to the paint brush and tree-trimmer, many also take it on the shoulder. For while the shoulder is the body's most talented joint, it is also inherently unstable and, after the knee, it is the most vulnerable link between bone and bone.   Yet few know how to care for this important joint, which plays a crucial role in a host of routine tasks, like combing the hair, turning a doorknob, carrying a briefcase and writing a letter. All too often, the first hints of shoulder problems are ignored or mistreated, leading to a much more serious, painful and longer-lasting injury. Knowing how to recognize the early signs of trouble and how to strengthen and stretch the shoulder joint to increase its resistance to injury can save misery down the line. Vulnerable Joint    Dr. John M. Fenlin, an orthopedic surgeon affiliated with Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia who has devoted his career to the shoulder, describes it as \"a very elegant joint,\" with both great power and great mobility.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940427","headline":"4 Defendants Ask Lawyers Be Changed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/nyregion/4-defendants-ask-lawyers-be-changed.html","abstract":"  With a week to go before sentencing, all four men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing have dismissed their defense lawyers and asked to be represented by William F.

Despite some inexcusable irregularities, both sides won: the country's ruling Arena party as well as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or F.M.L.N., the former guerrilla coalition that laid down its arms to participate as a political party in the elections.   As expected, Arena's presidential candidate, Armando Calderon Sol, beat the F.M.L.N.'s Ruben Zamora. But in winning some 33 percent of the vote under difficult circumstances, Mr. Zamora established himself and his party as legitimate and important players in the country's politics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940428","headline":"1944: Britain Prepares : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/opinion/IHT-1944-britain-prepares-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] Approximately 50,000,000 persons in the British Isles were isolated from the outside world at midnight last night [April 27] when all normal travel to points abroad ceased under one of the most drastic anti- spy decre","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940428","headline":"Review/Music; Progress Report From Cincinnati","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/arts/review-music-progress-report-from-cincinnati.html","abstract":"  The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra has made great strides in recent seasons. When it performed in New York in 1988, a year after Jesus Lopez-Cobos became its director, the orchestra played respectably, with occasional flashes of brilliance. Heard again 13 months ago, the players produced a polished sound and robust, high-energy performances that surmounted occasional flaws and left a strong impression. Mr. Lopez-Cobos brought his players back to Carnegie Hall on Monday evening, and proved that last year's performance was not a fluke.   Mr. Lopez-Cobos's program could have been more stimulating. Although it could be argued, in a pinch, that the Dvorak Seventh Symphony is heard too rarely, the work is hardly outside the mainstream. The rest of the evening was given over to Brahms, beginning with a vividly played and beautifully shaped account of the \"Tragic\" Overture, and moving on to a less fully satisfying performance of the Violin Concerto.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940428","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/nyregion/news-summary-912310.html","abstract":"  International A3-15  31 WHITES ARRESTED IN BOMBINGS  Striking back at election terrorism, the South African police announced the arrest of 31 white extremists charged with 21 bombing deaths.

That agenda emerged from three weeks of debate, confrontation and aggressive lobbying among delegates from 170 countries meeting at the United Nations this month. True, it is not yet the hoped-for consensus document that could serve as a blueprint for international family planning in the 21st century. But in recognizing that population and development policies must include the empowerment of women, it creates the right context for the Cairo discussions.
