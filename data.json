The embryos that contained the mutant gene were allowed to die; one of the normal embryos was implanted into the mother's womb, and she gave birth to a healthy baby.   In another case, a so-far-healthy member of a family with a history of Huntington's chorea, which cripples and kills its victims in middle age, volunteers to have doctors search his body for the culprit gene.

The question was whether Federal judges have the power to grant stays of execution to inmates who have exhausted their state appeals but have not found lawyers to help them file an initial petition for Federal court review. A majority of the Justices were visibly disturbed when the lawyer for the State of Texas argued that Federal judges did not have such power. Shortages and Difficulties    The Court was hearing the appeal of a convicted murderer, Frank B. McFarland, who came within hours of execution by Texas in November after two lower Federal courts refused his request for a stay. The courts held that they had no jurisdiction over any aspect of the case until the inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the document that initiates Federal court review of a state conviction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940330","headline":"Note to Readers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/opinion/note-to-readers.html","abstract":"  The Op-Ed page welcomes unsolicited manuscripts.

Neither he nor the administrators of Jazz at Lincoln Center have seen fit to do anything diplomatic about the complaints. Instead of backing down, they just keep on going.

Cora Sharpe, successful Hollywood screenwriter, has had difficulty sustaining romantic relations. Cora falls in love again, with Ray Beaudrilleaux, an entertainment lawyer. The romance fails, partly because Cora is a snob about lawyers, partly because she doesn't want to marry and partly because she won't give up what she calls her \"short list of long-term friends.\" So Cora ends up mateless but also pregnant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940331","headline":"Georgia Rejects Clemency for a Killer Who Says He Is Retarded","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/31/us/georgia-rejects-clemency-for-a-killer-who-says-he-is-retarded.html","abstract":"  The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles today rejected a last-minute clemency petition from William Henry Hance, a former marine who is appealing his death sentence on the ground that he is mentally retarded and that one of the jurors in his trial now says she never voted for a death sentence.

Our research demonstrates that those who make large contributions to Congressional candidates (and whose economic and legislative interests line up neatly with PAC inter- ests) provide more money to these candidates than PAC's do. In 1992, large individual contributions made up 35 percent of the total given to Congressional candidates, compared with 29 percent from PAC's. When you include Presidential candidates, large individual contributions ($375 million) dwarf PAC contributions ($180 million) more than two to one.   When you add large contributions from business-connected individuals to PAC contributions from the same businesses, the grand total dwarfs the next largest source of money -- labor -- by six to one. (If you compare PAC totals only, the ratio is three to one.)   PAC and large individual contributions together maximize the political clout of business. Our research shows this is true for every category of business, particularly health care, insurance and finance. Furthermore, the profiles of members of Congress who eschew PAC contributions, taking only contributions from individuals, show economically interested funding patterns virtually identical to those who accept PAC contributions.   Framing the campaign finance reform issue as a PAC issue encourages narrowly drawn \"reforms,\" which are more likely to freeze into place the worst aspects of the system or even make it worse. If we want real reform, which addresses the conflicts of interest and disenfranchising inequalities inherent in private financing of public elections, we need to understand the source of that financing. And that source is not just PAC's. ELLEN S.

On view is a remarkable exhibition of more than two dozen paintings and drawings and five sculptures by Max Beckmann, perhaps the most important German artist of the century. The show has an illuminating intimacy that penetrates the stiff, distancing layers that history and reputation so often give an artist, providing a glimpse of the inner workings of his mind and eye.   Beckmann died in 1950 in New York City at the age of 65, three years after he immigrated to the United States from Amsterdam, where he sat out World War II, and 13 years after he left Nazi Germany. Until 1933 he had been one of his country's most respected artists, with a room devoted to his work at the National Gallery in Berlin, but Hitler's rise to power and campaign against modern art changed that. Almost immediately, Beckmann, though not Jewish, was dismissed from the Stadel Art School in Frankfurt, where he had taught since 1925. Soon his paintings were yanked out of German museums, along with those by other members of the European avant-garde, to be placed in the Nazi's \"degenerate art\" exhibition of 1937.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940401","headline":"Bans on Cigarette Machines Are Upheld","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/nyregion/bans-on-cigarette-machines-are-upheld.html","abstract":"  Saying that \"ready access to cigarettes on the part of minors is a legitimate government concern,\" the New Jersey Supreme Court today upheld the right of municipalities to ban cigarette vending machines within their borders.

One of the few genuine insights provided by Mr. Yaguchi is that these days Jim Jarmusch must be the most eagerly imitated film maker in the world.   But it takes perfect deadpan timing, like Mr. Jarmusch's, to get this right. And \"Down the Drain\" lacks most of the necessary aplomb.

Extremists on both sides protested. Militant Palestinians object that some 450 Jewish settlers are still permitted to live amid the 80,000 Arabs of the Hebron area. Hard-line Israelis worry about the precedent set by admitting outside observers to territory where Israel claims authority. Months of delay and violence have clearly swelled the ranks of skeptics on both sides. Yet if violence and delay have become the main threats to peace, the security measures and accelerated timetable worked out in Cairo are the right response.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940401","headline":"1919: Dantzig Question : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/opinion/IHT-1919-dantzig-question-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - Marshal Foch will leave Paris for Spa to-morrow [April 2] to communicate to the German Government's plenipotentiary the decision of the Council of Four on the Dantzig question.

The production, introduced in 1989, was last seen two years ago. Hans Schavernoch's sets rely on a few bold strokes: first, large icy cliffs, and then the vast metal prow of the Flying Dutchman's ghost vessel looming behind the glazed platform of Daland's ship; a ceiling in Daland's house seemingly pulled low by pillars to suggest domesticity despite great size.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940401","headline":"Rangers Make Their Home Thoroughly Modern Texan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/sports/baseball-rangers-make-their-home-thoroughly-modern-texan.html","abstract":"  The Ballpark in Arlington.

Even for those who counted on a deeper and more faithful rendering of Isabel Allende's sweeping novel, this handsome, none too reverent film -- the intimate, star-crossed story of a powerful family, played out on an epic scale -- has the appeal of the unexpected.   Purists, beware: this is not a by-the-numbers screen version. Nor is it as politically charged as Ms. Allende's story. Nor does it even retain the flavor of her setting, which here seems oddly European at times. But it does take daring chances with a book that could not have been adapted otherwise, using extraordinary actors to rise above its occasional lapses.
