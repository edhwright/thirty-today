He was evicted from the mobile home he was renting and was reduced to living in his car for a time. But he found little compassion for his plight: In 1986, Mr. Peterson was convicted of raping a 4-year-old boy and molesting a 6-year-old boy in Hansville, a leafy city overlooking Puget Sound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930220","headline":"The Auteur Theory of Film: Holy or Just Full of Holes?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/20/movies/the-auteur-theory-of-film-holy-or-just-full-of-holes.html","abstract":"  It has been 30 years since the film critic Andrew Sarris, in a ground-breaking article for Film Culture magazine, proclaimed the ascendancy of the auteur theory, which enshrined the director as the sole author of a film.

In its encyclopedic survey of religious feelings, Bach's work had imitated in its musical lines the lashes of a whip, the weeping of the faithful, the fury of a crowd, the mockery of nonbelievers; the music had followed the text of the passion, interpolated with the exquisite commentary of arias and chorales. In the concluding moments, all the contrasts and trials of the story seemed a dream, leaving behind a gentle faith.   This was obviously not, for Mr. Masur, a casual performance. There is, of course, the geographic connection he has with the music: Bach's passion was composed and first heard in Leipzig, where Mr. Masur has been music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra since 1970. But Mr. Masur, in leading 24 members of the New York Philharmonic along with the Westminster Symphonic Choir in this work, also showed a close connection with its dramatic and religious meaning. The strict orthodoxies of authenticity were put aside, without doing harm to the score itself. There were times when matters became mundane, when there was too much stress, or too much exaggeration, but those were minor flaws in a performance that spoke of a deep love for this music and its powers.

Today, on the 28th anniversary of his assassination, Malcolm's story has become as American -- to borrow H. Rap Brown's famous aphorism -- as violence and cherry pie.\n\nMalcolm first came into my life some three decades ago, when I was 9 years old and Mike Wallace and CBS broadcast a documentary about the Nation of Islam. It was called \"The Hate That Hate Produced,\" and it showed just about the scariest black people I had ever seen: black people who talked right into the faces of white people, telling them off without even blinking. While I sat in our living room, I happened to glance over at my mother. A certain radiance was slowly transforming her soft brown face, as she listened to Malcolm naming the white man as the devil. \"Amen,\" she said, quietly at first. \"All right, now,\" she continued, much more emphatically. All this time and I had not known just how deeply my mother despised white people. The revelation was terrifying but thrilling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Composting Odors Roil East Moriches Neighbors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/nyregion/composting-odors-roil-east-moriches-neighbors.html","abstract":"HOMEOWNERS in East Moriches say they are tired of holding their noses.

Stewart, seeking an end to a non-winning streak that began after his 1991 United States Open victory, put his drive to the right on the fourth hole and took a drop from a cart path. In taking his stance, however, he got his right foot on the paved path -- a violation of the rules. He got a ruling from an official on the ninth hole and was assessed a two-shot penalty that enabled Rummells to vault into the lead.

McClancy clinched a victory with a fourth-place finish in the last event, the 800-meter relay, giving it a 33-29 final edge over Chaminade of Mineola, L.I.

Just 40 miles northeast of Innsbruck and a few minutes off the main highway that links northern Italy with Austria, Riedelglas also sells decanters, cut crystal vases and decorative platters at substantial savings. Visitors can tour the factory behind the shop to see how these superb handblown crystal wineglasses are produced.\n\nThe history of Riedelglas began in 17th-century Bohemia with Johann Christof Riedel, an itinerant glass trader. His grandson, Johann Leopold Riedel, founded the family firm in 1756; it is now directed by Georg Riedel, a 10th-generation glassmaker. During World War II, all six Riedel glass factories in what is now the Czech Republic, were seized by the Russians; Georg's grandfather Walter, a scientist who developed thousands of glass patents, was held prisoner in the Soviet Union for 10 years. His son Claus Josef finally obtained his release in 1955, and the father and son began again from scratch, this time in Kufstein.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Twice-Worn Suits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/opinion/l-twice-worn-suits-019793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   One paragraph of \"Hillary Clinton's New Home: Broccoli's In, Smoking's Out\" (front page, Feb. 2) describes the First Lady as \"wearing the muted plaid suit she wore on inauguration day.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"DEMOCRATS' UNEASE MAY SLOW CLINTON ON ECONOMIC PLAN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/us/clinton-s-economic-plan-democrats-unease-may-slow-clinton-on-economic-plan.html","abstract":"  Signs of dissatisfaction have begun to appear in Democratic ranks on Capitol Hill that could complicate and perhaps delay the passage of President Clinton's ambitious economic program, on which he has staked his political future.

Is that soap cushion with the small pebbles sewn into stainless-steel mesh so fine it feels like fabric the Ghost of Sointu, or of Smith & Hawken, or of all those froggy green oxidized metal objets we can't stand to look at anymore? Is that spiky-shaped muslin pillow that looks like a starfish on hallucinogens the Ghost of Philippe Starck's Toothbrushes? Do all the young and beautiful salespeople swathed in black come from the Royalton? Or is it the Paramount? They look happy here. I want to be happy here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Where the Ecotours Are","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/travel/where-the-ecotours-are.html","abstract":"  WALRUSES basking on ice floes in Hudson Bay, sea turtles laying eggs on remote beaches, howler monkeys in Brazil's flooded forests. These are a few of the sights being offered this year to the thousands of American tourists who are more interested in sampling a taste of unspoiled nature than lying on crowded beaches sipping margaritas. The more than 300 United States tour operators who are devising these environmentally themed tours include large, well-established adventure-travel companies, nonprofit organizations and small ecology-conscious entrepreneurs whose brochures, printed on recycled paper, describe seven or eight well-planned itineraries. The tours themselves range from relaxing \"soft adventure\" expeditions such as Tread Lightly's wildlife-viewing trips in Newfoundland to rigorous, hands-on involvement in forest-conservation efforts promoted by organizations like Earthwatch. All of these so-called \"ecotours\" are designed to promote a lasting appreciation of the natural world.   The concept of ecotourism, a term that entered popular usage in the late 80's, implies that tourism -- one of the world's largest industries, and often regarded as the spoiler of exotic cultures and locales -- might very well be the best conservation tool around.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"History and Hot Water in Arkansas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/travel/history-and-hot-water-in-arkansas.html","abstract":"ARKANSAS is loaded with springs and with places that call themselves springs: Blanchard and Heber Springs, Poison Springs, Siloam Springs, Rock, Cave and Crystal Springs, even Box Springs. The two best-known, Eureka Springs and Hot Springs, are brimming with history, as well as water so pure that moon rocks were stored there for study. Most recently, of course, Hot Springs has been in the spotlight as the town where President Bill Clinton grew up. Both towns have taken their turns as fashionable resorts, attracting visitors from all over the country, and in recent years they have undergone a renaissance, combining past glories with new attractions. \n\nWhile the histories of both towns are full of kooks, free spirits and law breakers, Eureka's denizens have been a decidedly more spiritual lot. The temperance crusader Carry Nation, for example, settled here in 1908, and her home, Hatchet Hall, has been converted into a museum. Today in Eureka, New Age devotees, unreconstructed flower people, fundamentalist Christians, environmental activists, craftspeople, artists and writers have all found a home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Lee S.

Bareyev, ranked eighth in the world, held the lead going into the last round, but Polgar smashed him to share top honors. In this double-round event, she also defeated him in round seven. FINAL STANDINGS           Player   Pts.              Polgar   9       Bareyev   9       Speelman   8       Gurevich, I.   7       Nunn   7       Sadler   7       Polugayevsky   5 1/2       Crouch   3 1/2         In her final-round game with Bareyev, Polgar gave one more bright illustration of her formidable power in attack.   The motive of the Burn Variation of the French Defense with 4 . . . de is to yield Black's strongpoint in the center to avoid a later cramping e5 and to bring about exchanges that would largely nullify White's advantage in space. In this way it copies Black's strategy in the main lines of the Caro-Kann Defense. But Bareyev never got beyond the one exchange with 7 Nf6 Nf6.   Rather than castle on the kingside early, Bareyev first finished the development of his queenside with 10 . . . Bb7, yet after 11 Qb5 Nd7 12 O-O-O, his lack of space was becoming more noticeable. And it became more noticeable still after Polgar's 14 c4 thrust.   On 17 Bd3, Bareyev probably should have tried 17 . . . Bd3, although his problems would not have been solved. For example, after 18 Rd3 Nf6?! 19 f5!, Black will quickly go under. Instead, he defiantly grabbed a pawn with 17 . . . Bg2 and faced a powerful attack after 18 Rhg1 Bd5 19 Qc2. Since Polgar was threatening to blast open the black king position with 20 f5, he blocked that possibility with 19 . . . f5, which was also intended to let him use his KR for defense.   Polgar aggressively charged with 21 c6!, crowding the black pieces even more.   On 22 Ne5, Bareyev's 22 . . . Bh4 prevented a doubling of the white rooks with 23 Rg3 and Rdg1, but Polgar revved up her onslaught with 23 Qe2 Qf6 24 Qh5.   On 24 . . . Red8, Polgar struck the annihilating blow with 25 Rg7! Bareyev could not play 25 . . . Qg7 because 26 Qh4 Kh8 27 Rg1 Qh7 28 Qf6 forces mate. But on 25 . . . Kg7 26 Rg1 Kh8 (26 . . . Kh7 is crushed by 27 Ng4!

Manaus is served by one of Brazil's most modern airports, and arriving at the heart of the Amazon has lost a little of the palm-trees-and-propellors charm it once had. Traveling on Varig flights from Miami and Los Angeles or on an increasing number of oceangoing cruise ships, Americans now account for 20 percent of foreign tourists visiting Manaus.    Most visitors come to explore the sea of Amazon forest that laps at the edges of this city of one million people. At first glance, Manaus seems to be a nondescript collection of moldy high-rises improbably wedded to a frenetic street life created by a free-trade zone. But, with a little discrimination, a visitor can discover stimulating diversions well worth exploring on both ends of a rain-forest tour. In getting around, it makes little sense to rent a car. Cabs will get you throughout the city and most roads stop once they reach one of the rivers in the Amazon system. Sightseeing    Remnants of Manaus's belle epoque can be seen on a two-hour walking tour. Sparked by a turn-of-the century rubber boom, the city was the first in South America to install streetcars and the second in Brazil to install electricity. Although Manaus is markedly safer than Rio, it is best to stroll with discretion and to avoid flashing valuables in public.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Clinics Try to Close the Gap in Health Care for the Disabled","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/nyregion/clinics-try-to-close-the-gap-in-health-care-for-the-disabled.html","abstract":"  FRUSTRATED with what they see as the failure of the medical establishment to provide adequate services for handicapped people, agencies for the disabled are developing new means of delivering the services.

I know how to do, what, fix cars a little bit?\" Cully, who just finished doing five at the Raiford pen for armed robbery, has assessed the alternative job opportunities in Beaufort, S.C., and doesn't see much chance for getting out of his old line of work. Considering the local crime wave that he sets off when he takes a chauffeur's job with a rich, mean farmer and his young, bored wife, Cully has good reason to feel he's in a rut. Not so the author, an auto mechanic from Paoli, Pa., whose precision-tuned first novel purrs with professionalism.   Readers who share Mr. Watts's fondness for Elmore Leonard and earlier    noir    models might be tempted to anticipate the drift once the boss's wife, Michelle, seduces Cully into betraying and robbing her husband. (Haven't we all seen this movie before?) But the author has many more plot curves and character bends to execute before getting this baby home to the garage. There's no predicting the nastiness that Michelle's psychotic former husband is capable of, and you'll never guess the stunt that her sister pulls during a bank holdup. Although Mr. Watts delivers all the sleazy sex, slick con games and fatalistic acts of violence that define the opaque    noir    vision, he writes with enough originality to map out his own route.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"'Twentysomethings' Can Give to Society","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/nyregion/l-twentysomethings-can-give-to-society-143093.html","abstract":"  As a \"twentysomething\" male who recently returned to his parents' empty nest, I certainly relate to the young people featured in \" 'Twentysomething' and Home Again on L.I.\"  [ Jan. 31 ] .

Revere, founded on Long Island in 1979 by Robert J. and Susanna M. Scaretta, is one of more than 200 armored car services that have gone into business since the late 1970's, when a series of antitrust court decisions forced what were then the industry's predominant companies, Brink's and Wells Fargo Armored Service, to sell off some of their fleets and give up some of their markets.    \"We shouldn't be too surprised by what happened here,\" said Robert McCrie, a professor of security management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. The collapse of Revere, he said, came at a time when hundreds of small armored car companies have sprung up across the nation, and banks have failed to check their competence or integrity. No New Regulations    \"It is the greater fools' approach to security,\" he said. \"The banks may know something is amiss with an armored car company, but they also know it is insured.\"   But while the court decisions reorganized the industry, neither Congress nor state legislatures stepped in with any new regulations covering who could run -- or even work for -- an armored-car company.    \"About all it takes is a truck, a warehouse and a big table to count the cash,\" Mr. McCrie said.   There is one other practical requirement -- insurance. As the number of armored-car companies has expanded, and the industry has become more competitive, the experts say one major insurer, Lloyd's of London, has emerged not only as the dominant underwriter of armored-car companies, but the only serious watchdog over their operations.  Insurer Undecided    In the Revere case, the authorities say that the Scarettas and their employees may have absconded with as much as $40 million from their clients, including Citibank and the National Westminster Bank. Although Lloyd's covered Revere against losses, lawyers for the insurer said this week that it had not yet decided whether to honor all claims.   Whether Lloyd's fully compensates Revere's clients, analysts say the case serves as a reminder of the need for greater scrutiny -- and perhaps greater regulation -- of the armored car industry.   \"A lot of banks have got to do a lot better job with their security,\" said Ira A. Lipman, president of Guardsmark, a major security consulting concern in Memphis.  A Costly Lesson    In Revere's case, \"the banks end up with egg on their face,\" said Mr. McCrie. Even if Lloyd's reimburses them for what has been found missing from Revere's warehouse, \"their investigatory and legal fees in this case are going to cost them a lot, and maybe teach them a lesson.\"   The owner of one armored-car company said the banks have sacrificed security for low costs.   \"The banks may say they want the best company, but what they really want is the lowest rate,\" he said. \"In the end, banks are more worried about who collects their trash than who they hire as an armored car carrier.\"  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"In the Region: Long Island;\nWhat's Next for Foreclosed Wyndham?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/realestate/in-the-region-long-island-whats-next-for-foreclosed-wyndham.html","abstract":"A COURT'S decision late last year upholding a foreclosure action against the developer of the Wyndham condominium in Garden City has left the 27 apartment owners in the 316-unit complex with mixed emotions.\n\nTheir hope is that a responsible buyer, not a speculator eager for quick profit, will now step in to finish the project, market it and bring values back up.

Another misleading assumption of the article is that dollars-spent-per-child is an automatic indicator of educational quality. Based on New York State Education Department statistics measuring student performance by such instruments as standardized test scores and numbers of Regents-accredited high school diplomas earned by local graduates, denoting successful completion of an academically rigorous curriculum, the high price paid by the taxpayers of the Oyster Bay school district does not translate into superior education for its students.

LOST LHASA: Heinrich Harrer's Tibet (Abrams, $39.95), a charming book of reminiscences, is organized around 200 of those black-and-white photographs of pre-Communist Lhasa -- a family album from a vanished world. Although Mr. Harrer includes shots of marketplaces, mounted archery contests and masked dancers in aprons of human bones, his most successful pictures are less exotic and far more surprising: members of the Lhasa cabinet inspecting a dike in a yak-hide coracle, holding umbrellas with a Victorian formality; the Dalai Lama's brother on a riverbank in sophisticated dark glasses and what looks like a silk dressing gown. In other images, monks skate on ice and cheat at cards, beefy police-monks brandish great staves, and criminals in ankle shackles beg by the side of the road. Mr. Harrer came to Tibet in 1944, at the age of 32, after escaping from a British internment camp in north India; he and a companion spent two years walking to Lhasa and arrived nearly starved. He was befriended by the Tibetan nobility and worked as a Government employee.

Dr. Eisenberg, who helped do a survey released last month that found that Americans spent $13.7 billion on alternative medicine in 1990, manages to be appreciative of the Chinese way of looking at health without going gaga about it; his steady approach lends credibility to a subject that has been known to turn some minds a little soft.   The first of five programs investigates the phenomenon called chi, which has to do with the flow through the body of what a Chinese doctor calls \"the force of life.\" Looking in at hospitals where traditional Chinese medicine is practiced, the Americans find that illnesses caused by obstructions to that flow are treated with herbs, needles, massage and meditation.

Calling on the unshakable nerves of youth, the 22-year-old left-hander conducted a putting clinic over the back nine at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, Calif., as he pulled away to a four-shot victory in the Buick Invitational. Mickelson, still wearing the can't-miss label earned in his spectacular amateur career, won his hometown tournament with a seven-under-par 65, including a decisive 31 over the back nine. Mickelson, who passed up a $180,000 prize to retain his amateur status when he won a PGA Tour event in Tucson in 1991, recouped that exact amount in the tournament he first attended as a boy from nearby San Diego and in which he once served as a standard-bearer. His mother, Mary, and father, Phil, a former instructor at the Navy's Top Gun School at nearby Miramar and the man who taught the game to his preschool son, were in the gallery as Mickelson began to fulfill the promise of his amateur days with a 10-under-par 278 winning total.

As the Olympic silver medalist in the giant slalom last year in France, Roffe-Steinrotter came to the Subaru United States Alpine championships here this week with a reputation as big as all outdoors. But she had been on a losing streak, despite her domination of the national event last year with gold medals in three events.    That changed today, the last day for the women in this competition. Roffe-Steinrotter, a 25-year-old skier from Potsdam, N.Y., streaked down a course laced with 45-mile-an-hour gusts of wind, and blowing snow. She finished first, with a total from two runs of 2 minutes 8.04 seconds. In second-place was Julie Parisien, of Auburn, Me., in 2:09.12; Heidi Voelker, of Pittsfield, Mass., was third in 2:09.57. No Sense Complaining    The women competed in conditions that Parisien said would have caused World Cup officials to cancel a race. But Roffe-Steinrotter said the weather turned out to be an advantage.   \"I grew up in the East,\" she said, referring to the cold, icy slopes where she learned to ski. \"Let other people stand up at the top and complain. It doesn't make much sense when you have a job to do.\"   It has been a tough year for Roffe-Steinrotter. She has not been able to duplicate her 1992 season, which included a spectacular run on the World Cup circuit and a No. 3 ranking in the world giant slalom standing.   \"For me, maybe I have been trying too hard,\" Roffe-Steinrotter said. \"My expectations at the beginning of the season were too high. Maybe I put too much pressure on myself and forgot to ski with the freedom you need to ski with.\" A Trying Year    The 21-year-old Parisien has also overcome a trying year. Ranked No. 1 in the world in slalom at the beginning of this season, she won the first World Cup slalom, at Park City, Utah. But she was sidelined temporarily in January with a knee injury, and is still reeling from the death in December of her brother, Jean Paul.    But in the championships here, Parisien regained some of her prowess. Besides the giant slalom, she won a silver medal in the super giant slalom, and a bronze in the slalom. She also won a gold medal in the combined, a total of all four events including the downhill.   \"I'm a little disappointed in my downhill,\" Parisien said. \"I was seventh, and I definitely think I should have been in the top five. But over all, I'm psyched. I pulled myself together after being really tired after Japan.\"   As did the other world-class skiers here, Parisien competed two weeks ago in the world Alpine championships in Shizukuishi, Japan, where she won a silver medal in the slalom. A Near Sweep    This is the third year in a row that Voelker, 23, won a bronze medal at the nationals. \"I'm very happy with my third-place,\" she said, noting that the competition has been more intense than in other years.   The United States women's team excelled here, winning 13 of 15 medals. The other two went to Lindsey Roberts of Canada. Picabo Street, of Sun Valley, Idaho, who has emerged lately as a major world-class contender, won the silver in the combined; and Kristi Terzian, of Park City, Utah, won the bronze.   The American men were under much more pressure from the Canadians. So far, the Canadian men's team has won four medals, compared with five for the United States. The men are scheduled to race their giant slalom on Monday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930222","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/arts/dance-in-review-726493.html","abstract":"  Yanceydance Theater  Ohio Theater  SoHo    Leslie Yancey creates considerable atmosphere in \"Trio,\" the opening work of an evening of theater-dance pieces presented on Thursday.

At the end of the sold-out concert, on Saturday night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., flocks of women were finding their way up to kiss the group's charismatic lead singer, Jon Bon Jovi, dance with him a bit, and be photographed not just in his presence, but also all over and around his presence. It was rock celebrity pandemonium, and everybody, fans and band alike, were having a great time.   One of the great myths fueling rock suggests that lower-middle-class people, usually male and white, can both make oodles of money and maintain the rebellious stance so important to rock's adolescent audience. There's a clear contradiction in the myth, and Bon Jovi, as well as any band alive, has learned to play both sides of the problem. In 1986, when the band's record \"Slippery When Wet\" (Polygram) began its ascent, eventually selling some 13 million copies, Bon Jovi was the ideal prole band, a group of guys from New Jersey who hit it big. In their clothes, action and lyrics, the band pointed to a blue-collar tradition not so much linked to the urban decay mined by self-conscious prole poets like Bruce Springsteen, but to a suburban reality found in mall glamour and wasted Saturday nights. Mr. Bon Jovi, with his long blond hair, became a rock celebrity who was a hunk, enormously wealthy and who could sing songs like \"Wild in the Streets.\" Critics, preferring to celebrate older, more romantic types of working-class rebellion, hated -- and still hate -- the band.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930222","headline":"Put American Troops in Macedonia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/opinion/put-american-troops-in-macedonia.html","abstract":"So far, Washington's Balkan policy has been built on principles of bluster and bluff.
