Some speculated that this freakish  weather was further evidence of long-term global climate change. But focusing on individual events would be a mistake. Unusual weather conditions have always been normal. \n\n     This does not mean that global climate change is not occurring. A United Nations scientific panel recently concluded for the first time that global warming had begun and would intensify because of rising levels of heat-trapping  gases emitted by burning coal, oil and natural gas. The magnitude of the change  is uncertain, but over the next 100 years, the panel estimated, the planet's average surface temperature is expected to rise by 1.4 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19960110","headline":"COMPANY NEWS;EARNINGS RESULT IN A SPECIAL DIVIDEND AT
