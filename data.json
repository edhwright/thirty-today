The curtain rose on a modern-dance concert, and a stage full of prettiness. Clearly defined men and women moved through glowing light, dressed in simple clothes that would clearly never pass muster with any self-respecting high-fashion designer. Lilting Chopin issued from a piano to the left of the stage, accompanying the performers through dances from Jose Limon's lyrical \"Mazurkas.\"   There were reassuring doses of angst and rigorous abstraction to come. Limon, who died in 1972, had his feet firmly planted on the ground and his eyes turned upward. But this first program of the Limon Dance Company's two-week season at the Joyce opened a door -- through \"Mazurkas\" and an eloquent performance of the Limon classic \"The Moor's Pavane\" -- onto a different world than that of the brainy, stylish, hyperactive modern dance of the 1990's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"Italy's Knight in Teflon: Tycoon Repulses Charges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/world/italy-s-knight-in-teflon-tycoon-repulses-charges.html","abstract":"  The candidate had been touching the bases -- the soccer set in Milan, the disco set in Rome, the homemakers, the aristocrats, the Chief Rabbi.

The work was commissioned by the orchestra, and the performance was its world premiere.   Mr. Ge was born in Shanghai in 1954 and began his training there, completing it at Columbia University. Like Bright Sheng, Chen Yi and Tan Dun, composers with similar biographies, Mr. Ge comes to Western instrumentation and compositional forms with fresh ears. His rhapsody alludes to Chinese timbres, most notably in occasional sliding string figures and in passages for wood blocks. Chinese propulsive techniques are used, too: in one particularly moving section, a solid, full-orchestra chord is repeated at an increasing tempo, an effect drawn from Chinese opera.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"One by One, Marquees Light Up As Spring Comes to Broadway","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/theater/one-by-one-marquees-light-up-as-spring-comes-to-broadway.html","abstract":"  It's almost April, and as sure a sign of spring as any is that old bear Broadway, lumbering out from under its snow blanket and blinking itself awake just in time for the Tony Award nominations. Winter, always the sleepiest time of the Broadway season, has been especially so this year, with the biggest news -- \"Show Boat\" ushers in the $75 ticket! Glenn Close replaces Patti LuPone in \"Sunset Boulevard\"! -- concerning shows not due until fall. And as has been the pattern the last several years, the season's final month will be its busiest, with 12 shows opening before the Tony deadline on May 11, beginning tonight with \"Carousel\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center.   Up to now, what kind of season has it been? Well, not too good. The consensus, in the words of Alan Wasser, the general manager of three Broadway musicals, is \"it's been slow, no question, both in terms of production and in terms of attendance.\" As in the last few seasons, he said, \"you reach March and nothing much has happened, and then there's a handful of things coming in that everyone pins their hopes on.\" Signs of Hope    Nonetheless, there are some positive notes. All but 2 of Broadway's 35 theaters have had or will have a booking this season. And despite the worst winter weather in memory, compared to the situation last year at this time, the number of total productions is up (to 24 from 19), attendance is about even (right around 6 million) and total receipts, more than $266 million, are up slightly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940324","headline":"Parcells Seeks a Giant Look","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/sports/pro-football-parcells-seeks-a-giant-look.html","abstract":"  Bill Parcells is not only trying to acquire current Giants players, he is also going after some former Giants as well.

In the scheme of things, this brawling little world is nothing, a mere speck in the cosmos, ignored by the indifferent moon overhead.

Jensen, who died in 1981 at the age of 78, painted pure thought much of the time, using such esoterica as numbers theory, the Mayan calendar, astrology, the I Ching, mathematical formulas, molecular physics and the precession of the equinoxes to determine his compositions. In many ways his work is as cerebral as the most attenuated forms of Conceptual Art.    But Jensen also gave body to thought, obsessively translating his elaborate systems into an irresistible painting style distinguished by radiant colors, pulsating patterns and thick, palette-knifed surfaces that narrow the gap between art and cake icing.

Unless they choose a field of study in high demand, graduate school is not a simple solution.   Indeed, a graduate degree can lessen the chance of finding a job if one does not have substantial experience beforehand. The experience trap is such that most positions that require a master's degree also require two years of experience. Entry-level positions that would enable one to gain experience require only a bachelor's degree. Thus companies are reluctant to consider applicants with advanced degrees because they are perceived as overqualified.   Times of structural shifts in the economy highlight the deficiency of a market economy in matching employees with employers. From an economic standpoint, unemployment and underemployment reduce the productive potential of the economy. From a human perspective, a spiral of rejection can lead to destruction of self-esteem.    Young people leave college with self-confidence, believing they can help change the world. At the end of the humiliating job search they wonder if they can change a light bulb.   Other than through contacts and unethical insider information, the prime way people look for jobs is through newspaper want ads. Many newspapers have yet to enter the computer age, except for a few like your Fast Track service. It is time consuming for applicants to sift through the want ads and for businesses to go through hundreds of resumes. Computerized searches using new software would greatly increase the efficiency of matching applicants with employers.   Therefore, Congress ought to speed approval of the computerized national jobs bank contained in the Clinton Administration's job retraining plan. Putting jobs on line maximizes both economic efficiency and social justice, which cannot be said of too many things.

Tashkin advocates medicinal use of dronabinol, a synthetic cannabinoid in capsule form, instead of smoked cannabis. Most patients who have compared smoked cannabis with dronabinol say that smoking is always more effective. Variations in the absorption of oral cannabis from the digestive tract make it difficult to control the dose. Also, people who suffer from nausea and vomiting find it difficult to take cannabis orally.   Dr. Tashkin reviews some concerns about the long-term effects of cannabis smoking on the lungs. After studying cannabis more than 25 years, I have come to believe, largely due to Dr. Tashkin's work, that pulmonary effects are the only well-documented harm from long-term cannabis use. I believe his letter exaggerates this, but it has little to do with use of cannabis as a medicine.   I would share Dr. Tashkin's concern if medical cannabis users had to smoke many cigarettes a day. But most people who use cannabis as a medicine (for multiple sclerosis, AIDS weight loss syndrome, migraine headaches, epilepsy, menstrual tension, nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy) need a few puffs to relieve symptoms.    Patients who use some of the newer, more potent strains of marijuana need to inhale even less noxious smoke. Dr. David B. Busch of the Department of Environmental and Toxicologic Pathology has demonstrated, examining lung cells, that sinsemilla, a potent form, has fewer of the pulmonary effects Dr. Tashkin describes than standard varieties.    Water pipes can also filter carcinogen substances in marijuana, a practice the Government unfortunately discourages. When marijuana becomes available as a medicine, we should see even more efficient ways to separate noxious from useful constituents of the smoke.   Dr. Tashkin's cautions should be taken seriously in some contexts, but they have little relevance to the use of smoked cannabis as a medicine.

In the last few years, the time lag of nostalgia has caught up with the 1970's, and what seemed a decade ago to be the most embarrassing pop era has been embraced anew, with and without campy irony. At the time, disco's worship of artifice, its unsubtle beat and its superficial lyrics earned the scorn of many rock fans. Yet disco's uncomplicated, pre-AIDS hedonism now strikes some listeners as an Edenic state, before the advent of even more mechanical dance music and even less convincing party anthems. Disco wasn't entirely without variety; the beat carried touches of big bands, doo-wop vocal harmonies, gospel and torch singing.

Enter, Outrage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/arts/modify-beckett-enter-outrage.html","abstract":"  Samuel Beckett's \"Footfalls,\" a 20-minute monodrama that was originally staged in 1976, has become the center of a theatrical tempest. Trustees of the playwright's estate were so enraged by Deborah Warner's revival here that they canceled the rights for a European tour. English critics were diametrically opposed in their assessments, while audiences filled the Garrick Theater. In an unusual venture, the play, starring Fiona Shaw, was performed twice every evening, with theatergoers paying $:4 (about $6) for unreserved seats.   The play closed over the weekend after its one-week run, but the controversy won't subside, with Beckett partisans demanding fidelity to his text and others insisting on greater theatrical license for directorial interpretation. Clearly, the event will have repercussions on how Beckett's plays, and plays by other recently deceased authors, will be done or not done in the future. Although there have been a number of conflicts over productions of Beckett, this is the first significant clash since the playwright's death in 1989. Modernist Collaborators    The production of \"Footfalls\" was the latest in a series of collaborations between Ms. Warner and Ms. Shaw. Having previously worked together on \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"Electra,\" they brought their modernist sensibilities to bear on this pivotal experimental work. Their own stature in the English theater almost guaranteed a successful run.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940326","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/arts/classical-music-in-review-587630.html","abstract":"  Festival of 20th-Century Music  Manhattan School of Music","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940326","headline":"Utility Shares: A Qualified 'Buy'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/your-money/IHT-utility-shares-a-qualified-buy.html","abstract":"ANY movement in interest rates, like this week's inching higher of short- term rates in the United States, places investor focus on the types of equities that are most sensitive to such movements.

Oswald's mother (Ann Petren) is patient, understanding and totally without illusions about her husband.
