One school holds that a massive object from outer space slammed into the Earth, kicking up a worldwide pall of dust that blotted out the Sun and killed off many plants and animals. The other school prefers to seek the cause of the global mayhem in natural processes like big volcanic eruptions.   Each side has accumulated a lot of evidence to support its case, though lately the advocates of an asteroid collision seem to have had the upper hand.

The work's finale is a tribute to P. D. Q.'s purported father, Johann Sebastian Bach, and therefore used the dark, chromatic four-note motif that J. S. used as a musical signature. Who else but P. D. Q. Bach would introduce a rambunctious version of \"He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" as a counter theme?   Mr. Schickele probably would, but until musicologists prove otherwise, listeners must accept his claim to be merely the discoverer of this and other P. D. Q. Bach works, not its author. Musicologists will most likely steer clear of Mr. Schickele, though. For the last 29 years he has been sending them up royally in his annual seminars on P. D. Q.

This year there could be no games at all -- or at best games played by impostors. The two sides have a responsibility to resume talks. The owners may not want to, but two influential U.S. Senators -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah -- think they have hit upon the right stimulus. They will offer legislation ending the owners' cherished, 72-year-old exemption from antitrust laws. That exemption gives the owners uniquely broad powers over wages and work rules that, the Senators believe, dampen their incentive to compromise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941229","headline":"Gun Exchange Plan Yields Few Results","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/29/nyregion/gun-exchange-plan-yields-few-results.html","abstract":"  The Goods for Guns exchange that took about 2,800 guns off the streets and out of homes in New York in a six-week period last year took in only 313 guns last week, the organization's founder said yesterday.

He speaks with pride of the National Service Trust Act, which he signed into law last year. There's just one problem.

Mr. Sharp, a fixture in downtown Manhattan's avant-garde music clubs, is well known for his refusal to stick to any single style of music or grouping of musicians and for his insistence on breaking down the perceived barriers separating composed music, improvisation, rock, jazz and acoustic theory. In his most basic guise, he hops onstage with any band and improvises on his double-necked bass-guitar; at his most complicated, he twists music derived from mathematical concepts like the Fibonacci series or fractal geometry into dense sonic structures.   On Thursday, Mr. Sharp demonstrated that he is no mere dabbler: his vast array of compositions were all unified by a thick, chunky sound and sharp, pointillistic playing. The evening began with a strong series of pieces played by Mr. Sharp's guitar quartet, which also included Roger Kleier, David Mecionis and John Myers. Though the group investigated the shimmering overtones that can result from clusters of synchronized retuned guitars (as heard in the music of Glenn Branca), it also explored other terrain, from the out-of-phase riffing of \"Residue\" to the Sonic Youth-style dissonance of \"Flowtest,\" both from the band's new album, \" 'Dyners Club,\" available from the Swiss label Intakt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941229","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/29/nyregion/c-corrections-242047.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 19 about hiring by New York State during the transition between the Cuomo and Pataki administrations referred incorrectly in some copies to the agency being monitored by Michael Clemente, a Pataki transition aide.
