Not Yet.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/opinion/trust-assad-not-yet.html","abstract":"After their marathon meeting in Geneva on Sunday, President Clinton was asked if he felt that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had made a firm commitment to normalize relations with Israel. Without hesitation, Mr. Clinton replied, \"The short answer is yes.\"\n Well, maybe. Mr. Assad's record suggests that it is wise to be skeptical about his intentions. As in the bad old days when he was a Soviet client, he still engages in aggressive activities, aimed mostly at Israel, Turkey, Lebanon and the United States. They include the following:\n * Building up Syrian unconventional military capabilities. Damascus now has thousands of chemical warheads, appears to be on the verge of putting anthrax agents into weapons and is starting nuclear research. Its Scud-C missiles from North Korea can reach most of Israel's population.\n * Getting more involved in the drug trade. Top officials participate in trafficking drugs to the West, according to a 1992 Congressional report.\n * Sponsoring Lebanese and Palestinian groups that attack Israelis as well as Palestinians who favor Yasir Arafat, and sponsoring the PKK, a Kurdish Marxist group, in its assaults on Turkey.\n\n* Nurturing an alliance with Iran. So close is this bond, the Syrians have distributed counterfeit U.S. currency produced in Iran, according to a report by the House Republican Research Committee.\n In short, Mr. Assad's policies have made Syria one of the Middle East's rogue states, along with Libya, Iraq and Iran. No less important, Mr. Assad represses his own people with a harshness second only to Saddam Hussein's. But while Washington puts pressure on the other rogue states by working to isolate them, it woos Syria. Rather than isolating the regime, it has tried for years to bring Syria into the \"family of nations.\" Our diplomats hold out small bait to encourage cooperation; last month, for example, we permitted Syria to acquire American-made jets. Secretaries of State and other dignitaries regularly travel to Damascus, and now four U.S. Presidents have met with Mr. Assad. Our companies operate in Syria almost without restrictions.\n Mr. Assad has avoided the harsh treatment dealt to Muammar el-Qaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Iran's mullahs because he's smarter than they are. He makes gestures at the right time and plays complicated double games. He keeps diplomatic links open and accommodates when necessary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940118","headline":"Hall's Hurley Explains","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/sports/sports-people-basketball-hall-s-hurley-explains.html","abstract":"  Depression, lack of self-esteem and difficulty dealing with stress led to DANNY HURLEY's decision to take a leave of absence from Seton Hall's basketball team on Dec. 4, the junior guard has said in an interview with several New Jersey newspapers.   \"I had it in my head that anything short of being an N.B.A. player, I'm a failure,\" he said. \"When I wasn't performing like an N.B.A. player, I started getting depressed.\" (AP)  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940118","headline":"The Veep Signs On","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/18/opinion/the-veep-signs-on.html","abstract":"  The Clintons' style of damage control has certain hallmarks that have been on clear display since the 1992 campaign.

Presented by Home for Contemporary Theater and Art, Randy Rollison, artistic director; Barbara Busachino, producing director. WITH: Chuck Coggins, Karen Levitas, Thomas Pasley and Lisa Welti.   There actually is no place like home in David Greenspan's \"Son of an Engineer,\" that is to say, home as a fixed institution doesn't exist. The story of a young man who returns to the suburban house of his childhood to discover his parents have \"moved on,\" this labored fable presents the nuclear family as a sinister disappearing act. And when a character turns on the radio, a voice announces, with comically frantic desperation, \"All these people come and go from our lives, and we don't know them anymore.\"   This is not very surprising news. Nor are the devices Mr. Greenspan employs -- a jumble of classic Albee-esque absurdism and imagery drawn from fairy tales, the Bible, Shakespeare, 1950's domestic sit-coms and apocalyptic science fiction -- particularly original.   As a result, \"Son of an Engineer,\" which has received a fairly skeletal production at the Here arts center in SoHo, often feels like a flat-footed, catch-all parody of vintage, symbol-laden avant-garde theater. It is unclear as to just how ironic Mr. Greenspan, who achieved a certain notoriety for his work with the New York Shakespeare Festival, is in his manipulation of this material. But there seems to be an agonizingly personal sense of anomie behind it.   The play's passive hero, identified only as the Killian Boy (Chuck Coggins), finds his old home inhabited by Tom (Thomas Pasley), a shaggy bear with a goofy, Disneyesque voice; Tom's wife, Phoebe (Karin Levitas), who dresses like Donna Reed and speaks with velvety ominousness; and Phoebe's mostly invisible daughter (Lisa Wells).   Directed with a cloudy mix of archness and anguished earnestness by Mr. Greenspan, \"Son of an Engineer\" includes a scene in which the naked son performs fellatio on the monstrously endowed paternal bear, while Phoebe ruefully washes her breasts in a Martian wilderness. It is that sort of evening.

North, a Marine major, is assigned to the National Security Council at the White House.  DECEMBER President Ronald Reagan signs an executive order that authorizes a covert operation by the C.I.A. to support the contras, rebels who are fighting the leftist Government of Nicaragua. The Administration hopes its secret backing will bolster the contras' appearance as an indigenous independent force. 1982  DECEMBER With accounts of U.S. backing leaking out, Congress enacts the Boland Amendment, which bars the use of Federal money to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government. 1984  SPRING Major North is assigned as White House contact with the contras. 1985  FEBRUARY Through dummy corporations abroad, Colonel North and two associates -- Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and Albert A. Hakim, an Iranian-American arms dealer -- make the first of six purchases of weapons destined for the contras. The money comes from private contributions, all secret. By keeping the source of the money private, the White House is able to squeeze through a loophole in the Boland Amendment and maintain that this arms supply is legal.  SUMMER News accounts link Colonel North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras. The reports prompt questions from Congress, and Mr. North helps Robert C. McFarlane, the President's national security adviser, prepare a denial.  JULY Israeli Government officials, who long viewed Iran as a counterweight to Iraq and other Arab enemies of Israel, tell Mr. McFarlane that the Iranians want to open a \"political discourse\" with Washington. Although the United States publicly views the Teheran Government as terrorist and has outlawed arms sales to it, this overture soon leads to the first shipment of American weapons to Iran, without legal authorization. The shipment, in turn, brought the release of one of seven Americans held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic militants.  NOV. 19 Colonel North is appointed by Mr. McFarlane to handle logistics for a second arms shipment, of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, to Iran.  1986  APRIL 4 In a memo to John M. Poindexter, who has succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, Colonel North proposes diverting to the contras $12 million of the proceeds from the sale to Iran. The memo, Colonel North will later testify, was intended for President Reagan.  MAY 25 Mr. McFarlane, who has formally left the Government but remains a consultant to the White House, flies secretly to Teheran with Colonel North and other officials, carrying spare parts for missiles.  AUG. 6 Meeting with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel North denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. As he later testified, this was a lie.  OCT. 5 Carrying arms to the contras, a cargo plane is shot down over Nicaragua. Three crewmen are killed, and a fourth, Eugene Hasenfus, is captured by the Nicaraguan Army.  NOV. 22 Justice Department investigators discover in Colonel North's office his April memo proposing the diversion of arms-sale money to the contras. NOV. 23 Colonel North meets privately with Mr. McFarlane and tells him that the diversion was approved by White House superiors. The colonel also meets with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and informs him. NOV. 24 Mr. Meese tells the President of the diversion. NOV. 25 Mr. Meese discloses the Iran-contra connection. Mr. Reagan announces Mr. Poindexter's resignation and Colonel North's dismissal.  1987  JAN. 6-7 Special committees of the Senate and the House are created. FEB. 26A Presidential commission led by former Senator John G. Tower blames the President's top advisers for a chaotic environment that, the commission says, led to the Iran-contra affair. The panel says the President was largely out of touch with the operations of the N.S.C.  JULY 7 Appearing before the Congressional committees, Colonel North begins six days of frequently fervent testimony.

Walsh, including rebuttals: Executive Summary     In October and November 1986, two secret U.S. Government operations were publicly exposed, potentially implicating Reagan Administration officials in illegal activities. These operations were the provision of assistance to the military activities of the Nicaraguan contra rebels during an October 1984 to October 1986 prohibition on such aid, and the sale of U.S. arms to Iran in contravention of stated U.S. policy and in possible violation of arms-export controls.

This six-year-old affair -- conceived by Sonja Frisell, designed by Gianni Quaranta and costumed by Dada Saligeri -- responds, without a lot of intellectual mind bending, to the materials given it. It does not seek subtlety where none exists. With imagination, resourcefulness and right-on technical expertise, it successfully translates the concept of fortissimo from ear to eye. And after all, no one has ever accused Verdi's 26th opera of being chamber music.   Finely orchestrated, vocally grateful both for singer and listener and relentless in its dramatic progress, \"Aida\" certainly is. And there are its intermittent intimacies to admire as well. But from the brilliant trumpet writing of the Triumphal March to the love of wide leaps in the singing lines (the major seventh is a recurring interval), monumentality seems most on Verdi's mind.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940119","headline":"THE NEW YORK STATE BUDGET: An Eye on November; Budgets Have a Variety of Audiences: Voters of All Stripes and Bankers Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/19/nyregion/new-york-state-budget-eye-november-budgets-have-variety-audiences-voters-all.html","abstract":"  In an ideal election-year budget, a chief executive spreads largess far and wide, and the closer the money gets to the swing voters the better.

With the advent of music schools and the easy access to recordings, young musicians tend to gravitate to the same sources and the same ideas; idiosyncrasy is a long-forgotten notion. Von Freeman, the 71-year-old tenor saxophonist now at the Village Vanguard, is exactly that, idiosyncratic. He has lived in Chicago most of his life, and he sounds like it. His playing clearly has precedents, but in its distinctiveness, it can only have come from a place where jazz orthodoxy wasn't everything, where musicians had the time to experiment.   If the best jazz musicians have generally been able to muster the most resources, to bring the greatest rhetoric to bear on expression, then Mr. Freeman is a master. A solo of his, on up-tempo material, careens. He crams ideas into a short time then stops. The most noticeable element of his style is his manipulation of pitch, and he runs lines that seem to be paraphrasing some otherworldly harmony, dark sounds technically out of tune that slip quietly back into the normalcy of a tune's harmony. He pinches and squeezes notes, and lets them be soft for a minute, or hard for another. Sometimes he has notes run up his horn then lets squeals take over, howls that meander back into the realm of notes. And at times, he seems to be forcing three or four notes through his horn at once, a woolly mass that appears less as a pitch than just plain sound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940120","headline":"Doing the Continental : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/opinion/IHT-doing-the-continental-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Let us imagine for one ghastly moment that guerrilla fighting erupts among French-speaking, English-speaking and Indian- speaking Canadians, which very soon spills over into \"ethnic cleansing.\" The United States calls on its European allies for","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940120","headline":"Knicks Ransack Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-ransack-mr-robinson-s-neighborhood.html","abstract":"  The outcome was no surprise.
