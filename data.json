Knowing the pitfalls can help choose materials and techniques.   Almost any flooring can be installed over concrete. Resilient flooring -- sheet vinyl or vinyl tiles -- is a popular and inexpensive choice, but wood flooring and carpet are also possibilities. Stone, clay or ceramic tiles generally lack necessary warmth, both in appearance and underfoot, for most installations. But do not write them off as choices in half-basements receiving ample light from patio doors or large windows.   Before making a selection, test the moisture content of the concrete floor and consider the preparations needed for various materials. Choose three to six spots about two feet square in different locations. At least two spots should be near corners. The others can be in open areas.   Scrub the areas with a dry brush to clean them thoroughly. Cut pieces of plastic sheeting, kitchen wrap or aluminum foil and place them over the cleaned areas, sealing their edges with duct tape.   Remove the tape and check the undersides after 24 hours. If the plastic appears foggy or wet, the floor is too wet for installing any finish flooring.   On a new basement floor, waiting up to two months for the concrete to fully cure may eliminate the moisture problem. On older floors, the foundation may require more effective drainage, which is usually a job for a waterproofing contractor.   Test the floor for evenness. A floor does not have to be level to accept finish flooring, but the surface has to be flat, without bumps or hollows greater than an eighth of an inch in height or depth.   To check for those, place a long straight-edged board on the floor in as many different places and at as many different angles as practical. A board that rocks back and forth indicates a bump. Light beneath the edge of the board indicates a hollow.   Small bumps can sometimes be chiseled away. More often, though, flattening involves filling the low spots with a liquid or paste compound, which is spread with a flat trowel called a float and hardens like cement.   If a concrete floor is dry and flat, any type of flooring except hardwood planks or strips that require nailing can be directly installed.  Resilient flooring, cushion-backed carpet, parquet and wood-laminated flooring are installed with adhesive. Stone, clay and most ceramic tiles are installed by embedding in mortar. Ceramic tiles can also be installed with adhesive.   For insurance against moisture in cases where a basement slab may not have been poured over a vapor barrier of polyethylene -- standard practice at least since the 60's -- such sheeting or an equivalent material should be applied to the surface of the concrete beneath or between layers of flooring adhesive or beneath mortar.   To further flatten a floor, to protect large areas of leveling compound and to permit nailing solid wood-strip or plank flooring, a plywood underlayment is needed. For flooring fastened with adhesive, a single layer of half- or three-quarter-inch-thick plywood is adequate. Where a nailing surface is required, two layers of three-quarter-inch are best.   Use ACX-grade plywood, which has one good face and is rated for exterior use. Do not use particleboard or another manufactured-wood product. They do not hold fasteners well and are easily damaged by water.   On dry floors protected by a vapor barrier beneath the slab, underlayment panels can be fastened directly to the concrete with masonry nails, concrete screws or hammer-activated gunpowder-driven fasteners. Afterward, adhesive can be applied on top or solid wood flooring can be nailed directly to it.   Where a vapor barrier is needed above the slab, there are three ways to proceed. One is to spread a layer of asphalt mastic over the floor with a trowel, allow it to harden and then cover the mastic with overlapping sheets of polyethylene film. On top of that can be placed plywood underlayment panels, fastened by the methods described above.   A second way is to cut underlayment panels into manageable 4 X 4-foot pieces, saw or rout grooves in a grid pattern on their backs and then press them into a bed of mastic applied to the slab. No fasteners are necessary.    The third way, and the most common when installing solid wood flooring or when major flattening is needed, is to bed four-foot lengths of nominal one- or two-inch-thick preservative-treated lumber on the slab with mastic.    The boards, called sleepers, are placed with their wide surfaces against the slab and their ends overlapping by at least four inches. Hollows underneath are filled by adding shims. If desired, closed-cell foam insulation board can be placed between the sleepers for a warmer floor and to deaden footfalls.    Polyethylene sheeting is spread on top of the sleepers and fastened with staples. Solid wood flooring can be nailed directly above the plastic, with nails spaced to enter the sleepers. For flooring requiring full support, first attach plywood underlayment panels.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"800 Teddy Bears and Still Collecting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/nyregion/800-teddy-bears-and-still-collecting.html","abstract":"SCARLETT O'BEARA, Alice in Wonderbear Land, Dr. Killbear, the Vanderbear family: these are just a few of 500 teddy bears that decorate Doris Wagner's every nook and cranny this holiday season, making dusting almost impossible.\n\nTeddies swing from every twig on her Christmas tree and crowd every tabletop, all the cabinets, furniture and staircases.

Yaritza Almedina, 10, ran her fingers along her long pink skirt, delighting in the feel of the fabric. The teacher, Barbara Romero, pulled the string at the waistband as tight as it would go, then turned and helped other girls slip flamenco skirts over their jeans and leggings. She had tucked a pile of the skirts, her own costumes, in her dance bag so her students would have the chance to feel the flow of a pretty skirt as it caught the wind while they danced.\n\nAt the back of the stage, Yaritza began twirling, letting the borrowed skirt flutter as she moved. \"I would like to be a dance teacher when I grow up,\" she said. \"I like to do ballet and dance salsa.\"\n\nYaritza is one of two dozen girls and a handful of boys who are a month into their dance class at Munoz Marin. They are a fraction of the hundreds of students who will ultimately take part in the Connecticut Ballet Theater's Dance Exposure Project, a joint effort of the Southport-based Ballet Theater, the Bridgeport school system and Bridgeport area businesses and community service organizations.\n\nThe goal is to give elementary school students throughout the city a taste of dance, through in-school and after-school classes and through a performance tour by the company of the Connecticut Ballet Theater. Scholarships to the Ballet Theater school in Southport will be offered to promising students.\n\n\"Dance equals culture and it keeps culture alive,\" said the director of the Ballet Theater, Brett Raphael. \"There are 40 languages alone spoken in Bridgeport and dance is a way children can relate on a nonverbal level. It's also a self-esteem builder and if we can interest children who are at-risk early on, we can keep them interested right on up the ladder.\"\nThe Call of the Castanets\n\n The students, who spend an hour each week learning flamenco dance, are an eager, boisterous group. Ms. Romero, a professional flamenco dancer and dance instructor, drives in from Manhattan to teach the class. \n\nAt the start of a recent class, she clacked her castanets and within moments the lines of dancers dissolved, all of them eager to try out the instrument. She gave a quick lesson, slipping into and out of Spanish for the bilingual students. She then tried to corral the group back to some semblance of order and taught a few steps. They danced in a small space, just a curtain's pull away from basketball practice in the adjacent gym as music wafted from a cassette player.\n\n\"I enjoy teaching this class very much,\" Ms. Romero said. \"All kids need culture and dance and I like bringing it to them. It's a lot different from teaching a class in a studio and in that way it's much more of a challenge, but I really like it.\"\n\nAs a group of girls practiced swishing their skirts and clapping their hands, admiring each other's moves, the boys said they liked the stomping. \n\n\"You get to stamp your feet loud,\" Carlos Serrano, 10, said. \n\nHis brother, Anthony, 8, decked out in a string tie, stood next to him, raising his arms overhead in a flourish as he strove to learn Ms. Romero's steps. \n'An Exciting Place'\n\n Carlos said his parents liked to turn the radio up on the weekends and dance to Spanish music. \"We all love to dance,\" he said, adding that he had taken dance classes before at a local boys' club. \"I like coming here after school. My Mom works, so at home there'd be nothing for us to do after school except watch TV.\" \n\nThe dance class is just one element of an after-school program for Munoz Marin students sponsored by the McGivney Community Center, which runs youth programs for the neighborhood. \n\n\"These kids have an exciting place to be after school, a vital, interesting, safe place, and the dance program is just another part of the education,\" said Anthony F. Forni, the center's president. \n\nSusan McDonald, a teacher at Munoz Marin and the coordinator of the after-school program, said she had seen children improve in school after having become involved in the dance program.\n\n\"You see it on their faces as they dance,\" she said. \"They're so happy and they're so proud. What a wonderful thing that is. And it translates into success in the classroom because they feel that way about themselves.\" \n\nThe school's principal, Milagros Vizcarrondo, said the dance program taught self-discipline and gave students hope for the future.\n\n\"Not every child is going to succeed at math or reading but he may be an artist,\" she said. \"We live in a very economically and socially depressed area and this is not something parents can afford to do on their own for their children.\"\nCultural Development Is Goal\n\n Last year, the Connecticut Ballet Theater created a pilot program in four Bridgeport elementary schools, offering classes in flamenco, African and jazz dance as part of the school curriculum. It has expanded the program to include after-school programs sponsored by several community centers. Corporations and foundations like the Chase Manhattan Bank, the General Electric Foundation, the Bridgeport Futures Initiative and the Fairfield County Community Foundation are providing financial support.\n\nBrenda Smith, the president of the Bridgeport Futures Initiative, said one of the organization's goals was to provide children with as much cultural development as possible.\n\n\"Studies have shown that children who engage in artistic as well as cognitive programs when they are young do much better as adults,\" she said. \"It's important for children in the inner city, for children in the suburbs and in rural areas as well. They need that opportunity for self-expression.\"\n\nThe coordinator of the Dance Exposure Project and teacher of modern dance with the Connecticut Ballet Theater, Claire Mastromonaco, said that was why the dance theater had created the program. The Ballet Theater started a program in Stamford in 1991 and some of the students there went on to perform in the Ballet Theater's production of \"The Nutcracker.\"\n'A Fundamental Element'\n\n \"Bridgeport has so many resources,\" Ms. Mastromonaco said. \"The teachers in the schools, the people in the community want so much for their children, I've really seen that through this dance program. It just needs to be more united to get things done and I think that is happening here. The arts are a fundamental element to life and I think people are starting to see that. \n\n\"We've seen it in the kids,\" she said. \"The teachers say their energy level is more even during the school day. Learning to read and do math is so important, but through the arts you get to know yourself.\"\n\nAs the end of the class at Munoz Marin neared, Yaritza showed a series of steps to her younger sister, Marie, 8. \"This way,\" she said, with confidence. Her sister then followed her steps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"James the Ripper?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/books/james-the-ripper.html","abstract":"  THE DIARY OF JACK THE RIPPER Narrative by Shirley Harrison.

With approximately a 31-month backlog for tort cases in our state courts and a 20-month backlog in Federal courts, it is astonishing to realize that a lawyer may file civil suits that have no more chance of winning than could be predicted by the flip of a coin. We must suspect that our judicial system is hopelessly capricious if plaintiff attorneys cannot distinguish lawsuits that have the intrinsic merit to be successful from those that have only the potential to tie up our courts for extended periods of time.   Whether Mr. Williams's record is typical for plaintiff attorneys in Connecticut is difficult to determine because the statistical branch of the Supreme Court of Connecticut does not compile data on whether plaintiff attorneys are winning or losing civil cases. It is noted by the Connecticut lawyer James Rosenblum, however, in his book \"Malpractice Solutions\" that fewer than 30 percent of suits alleging medical malpractice are ultimately successful.

Lots of bands thrive by talking a violent game -- advocating sacrifices to Satan or killing police officers, for example -- but this is the rare time when a band's actions will actually help a murderer.   The band's decision to include the song \"Look at Your Game, Girl\" -- recorded by Mr. Manson in the late 1960's when he was trying to launch a folk-rock career -- means the jailed cult leader could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Manson is serving a life sentence in California for his part in the 1969 murders of the actress Sharon Tate and six other people.

After the section went to press, Geffen Records, which distributes the album, said that any royalties due Mr. Manson would have to go to satisfy a 1971 judgment on behalf of Bartek Frykowski, the son of one murder victim. Mr. Manson would be owed about $60,000 in royalties for every million albums sold.

Weisman Museum of Art, designed by Frank Gehry for the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, may remind you of the first time you saw mercury. You were a child, learning to differentiate between one thing and another, and along came this stuff that threw the whole idea of differentiation into doubt. Is it metal? Water? Magic? An adult version of Silly Putty? How come it neither hardens nor flows? Do you call it a piece or a puddle? Call it a lesson: the mind must make room for a world where things will not always fall neatly into place.   The mercurial quality of the Weisman Museum, which opened three weeks ago, isn't solely due to the quicksilver reflections of light that constantly play over its gleaming stainless steel facade. Nor is it just a matter of the mutable images -- a fish, an ice palace, Rapunzel's tower -- fleetingly evoked by the facade's flaring, curving facets. It arises, rather, from an idea about art and its place in the contemporary scheme of things. This is Frank Gehry's first art museum. He has designed some brilliant museum installations over the years, and his Temporary Contemporary, a converted industrial shed, remains one of downtown Los Angeles's enduring joys. But the Weisman is the first art museum Gehry has designed from the ground up, and it invites a closer view of the kinship between art and architecture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"Commercial Property/Rockefeller Center; Surmounting the Hump of Lease Expirations","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/realestate/commercial-property-rockefeller-center-surmounting-the-hump-of-lease-expirations.html","abstract":"  A YEAR or two ago, people seemed ready to sound a death knell for Rockefeller Center.

O'Neill, which is seeking to overcome the segregation of poor Hispanic and black children in Hartford's schools by linking the schools with those in 21 surrounding towns.   The suit seeks to improve the education of Hartford children by breaking up the concentration of minority students in the city's schools, where the enrollment is more than 93 percent Hispanic and black, and by obtaining more state aid to overcome the educational obstacles posed by poverty. Judge Hammer, who heard opening arguments in the case on Dec. 16, 1992, is expected to issue his decision in the spring. After nearly three months of testimony earlier this year, each side has summarized their arguments in briefs submitted to Judge Hammer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"De La Hoya Decision Has Its Costs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/sports/boxing-notebook-de-la-hoya-decision-has-its-costs.html","abstract":"  Steve Nelson, a mortgage banker, saw his most complex investment go sour the other day: Oscar De La Hoya dropped him as a manager.   \"Maybe if we had a boxing commissioner, it never would have come to this,\" said Nelson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"In SoHo, the Art Isn't Just on the Wall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/nyregion/good-eating-in-soho-the-art-isn-t-just-on-the-wall.html","abstract":"  ALISON ON DOMINICK STREET **  (212) 727-1188; 38 Dominick Street, between Varick and Hudson Streets; $$$; all major credit cards","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931212","headline":"At 33, He Is the New John Elway","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/12/sports/pro-football-at-33-he-is-the-new-john-elway.html","abstract":"  John Elway in pinstripes.

The original drugs had many unpleasant side effects, from dizziness and painful dry mouth to weight gain and sluggishness. Doctors, too, were uneasy about the potency of the pills, and thus prescribed the medications for short courses, up to nine months maximum.   Many doctors say they are comfortable keeping their patients on the newer antidepressants for long stretches. They say the drugs are safer than the older generation of pills, are almost impossible to overdose on, have fewer side effects and work wonderfully for patients who were difficult to treat before, including those who suffer from panic disorders, anxiety attacks, bulimia, anorexia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.    Yet the medical portrait of Prozac and related compounds emerging from years of use among millions of patients is not a simple sunburst of unfettered success. The drugs bear their own disturbing consequences and question marks, particularly in their long-term risks. Some doctors worry that, with all the pep talk surrounding the novel antidepressants, the trouble spots are being ignored and the pills being presented as the pharmacological equivalent of a Snackwell fat-free cookie: a chance at bliss without paying the price. 'Deceptively Easy'    \"Drugs like Prozac are so deceptively easy to take and tolerate that they can excuse a physician from respecting the complexity of depression,\" said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.    But that has not stopped some patients. Rebecca L. Morgan of Monaca, Pa., has been on Prozac for three years, since she was 27, and she has no intention of quitting, ever. The drug is the flagship member of a new fleet of antidepressants, and it has transformed her life. Before Prozac, she could not keep a job for more than a few months at a time. For the past year and a half, she has been a counselor for the mental health association in Beaver County. Before Prozac, she suffered five episodes of major depression, during which she could hardly drag herself off her couch or feel enough to realize she was miserable. Now, she still has emotional peaks and troughs, but when she is faced with an adverse event, she does not slide into a depression as she says she would have in the past.    \"I don't know what the long-term effects of the drug are,\" she said, \"but if 20 years from now they say it affects the kidneys or the lungs or whatever, I'm willing to pay the price. Prozac helps me now.\"   Ms. Morgan is not alone in embracing Prozac as a permanent therapy for the chronic problem that is her melancholic nature. Since Prozac was introduced five years ago, its popularity has soared to tropospheric heights. More than 10 million people have taken the drug worldwide, earning for its maker, Eli Lilly & Company, about $1 billion a year. Many other people are using even newer, chemically related drugs called by the trade names Paxil and Zoloft. And while most remain on the medications for less than a year, a sizable minority are staying on the drugs for two years or longer.  Drugs Are Specific    Much of the relative safety of the new class of drugs, called serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, lies in their biochemical specificity. The original antidepressants, introduced in the 1950's and known as the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, jiggle multiple biochemical pathways in the brain and reconfigure the balance of several different types of signaling molecules, or neurotransmitters. By comparison, Prozac and its cousins zero in on one neurotransmitter, serotonin, brightening mood and lessening anxiety by keeping pools of the chemical available in the brain for nerve cells to use and reuse. Greater specificity in the nervous system means fewer side effects throughout the body.    Nevertheless, some researchers warned that serotonin is a muscular chemical and that manipulating it even with exquisite specificity is bound to reverberate in unexpected ways. Although early fears that Prozac may occasionally initiate violent or suicidal behavior have not been supported by extensive clinical studies, new studies show that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have a more severe impact on sexuality than at first estimated, causing symptoms like impotence, an inability to ejaculate, an inability to reach orgasm, a loss of sensation in the vagina, and an all-round loss of interest in one's erotic affairs.    \"The early studies on this suggested an incidence of about 2 percent, but that was based on self-reporting, from the patients,\" said Dr. Peter Kramer, author of the best seller \"Listening to Prozac.\" \"When researchers went out and vigorously interviewed people, they found 40 percent had some sexual dysfunction.\"    Another common side effect of the new antidepressants that had been underemphasized until recently, said Dr. Brian Doyle, director of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program, is sleep disturbances. Perhaps a third of Prozac users suffer severe insomnia, and some who manage to fall sleep report excessively vivid dreams that can verge on nightmares.   For those Prozac users in whom insomnia becomes unbearable, some doctors prescribe small doses of, oddly enough, the older tricyclic antidepressants, which can be sedating. But physicians never mix the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors; that combination can be extremely dangerous, causing rigidity, rapid fluctuations in vital signs, extreme agitation progressing to delirium, coma and even death. Drugs Fail for Some    Researchers also warned that the serotonin compounds do not work for 20 percent to 40 percent of depressed or anxious people who try them, the same failure rate seen with the older antidepressants. Some patients say they find drugs like Prozac disorienting or too amphetamine-like in their properties, causing problems in concentration and memory.    Apart from known side effects, the risks of taking any antidepressant drug for years is not yet clear, for the simple reason so far no one has taken the drug for very long. In studies with mice and pigs, Canadian investigators have found that antidepressants can act as tumor promoters, hastening the growth of nascent malignancies. These preliminary results have yet to be confirmed by others, and there is no evidence to suggest that antidepressants contribute to cancer in humans, but some researchers admit that the long-term risks remain to be gauged.    Because women suffer a disproportionate rate of depression and thus are more likely to be takers of Prozac, a few studies have looked at the effect of the antidepressants on pregnant women. So far, researchers have seen no increase in birth defects from the drugs, but women who take any sort of antidepressant drug, including Prozac, have about twice the rate of miscarriages during the first trimester of pregnancy as do women not on the medications.    Nor can researchers be sure that exposing a fetus to a drug capable of altering the balance of neuronal signaling molecules does not have a subtle impact on the brain that only shows up years later, say, as a learning disorder. In addition, a nursing mother on Prozac may transmit traces of the medication to her infant, again with unknown effects. Long-Term Treatment    The trend toward treating recurrent depression as a chronic disease, deserving of long-term, if not lifetime treatment with antidepressants, is likely to accelerate, doctors said.   \"Eighty to 90 percent of people who had one episode of depression will have another,\" said Dr. David Kupfer, a professor and chairman of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"That realization makes me much more aggressive. People need long-term treatment, and we need to figure out the best strategy.\"   But some researchers observe with concern that the drift toward extended drug regimens is occurring in parallel with another trend: prescribing antidepressants for people who are not really depressed. Prozac is now being given with some regularity to patients diagnosed as \"dysthymic,\" jargon for perpetually crabby, under the weather, insecure, malcontent.   \"Dysthymia has less of a biological feel to it\" than does full-blown depression, said Dr. Doyle of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program. \"There's not as much of the sleep disturbances or the appetite problems. These are people who realize they're more unhappy than the situation calls for, and that meditation, exercise, talking to friends just doesn't do the trick.\"   As it turns out, Dr. Doyle said, many dysthymics do very well on Prozac and its chemical siblings, finding in the drugs a brightening of mood that therapy sessions alone may have failed to bring.    But whether the syndrome is a true disease is a matter of considerable debate among doctors. And to some critics, the idea of people who are not really sick taking potent psychiatric drugs for months or years is a sobering prospect indeed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931213","headline":"MOROCCO TO WIDEN LINKS WITH ISRAEL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/13/world/morocco-to-widen-links-with-israel.html","abstract":"  King Hassan of Morocco has decided to broaden his country's economic cooperation with Israel in a major step toward the eventual normalization of relations, senior Clinton Administration officials say.

But most people who marry hope and expect children to be born to them. We are willing to expend enormous amounts of love and attention and care as well as money to raise capable and healthy offspring. Surely, giving some thought to their genetic load is not misplaced (\"Nightmare or the Dream of a New Era in Genetics?\", front page, Dec. 7).   Dor Yeshorim, an Orthodox Jewish program using advanced molecular technology to screen young people considering marriage, was formed to enhance the effort to have healthy children by sparing potential partners the agony of conceiving genetically defective children. With increased medical research, there are many more conditions that can be prevented than Tay-Sachs disease.   While ethicists agonize over some people's being marginalized as marriage partners, they would do better to focus on the fact that medical conditions not manifesting themselves until middle age do not make them benign or pleasant to live with.   Very few of us are interested in spending much effort to maintain good health. Rather, good health is seen as a birthright. And while it is true there are many common conditions that do not compromise actual life, they do not enhance it either and many sufferers would prefer a less flawed genetic endowment.   Dor Yeshorim's purpose is to allow potential marriage partners to establish in advance of emotional involvement whether or not a relationship should be pursued. For those with multiple problems, presumably a pool of potential partners can be identified with whom normal children can be produced. Prevention beats remediation any day.

The Long Island Rail Road shooter also had to wait 15 days under California law, and was easily able to purchase a 9-millimeter automatic weapon and to wreak murderous havoc in just a few seconds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931214","headline":"Exploring the Frontiers Of Electronics at Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/14/science/personal-computers-exploring-the-frontiers-of-electronics-at-home.html","abstract":"  AFTER more than a decade of providing software for the business community, the Microsoft Corporation is going home.

The 23-year-old champion won five times and had one draw out of six games with it in the series, which was held at the Metropole Palace Hotel in Monaco and concluded in mid-November.   The reason this mode of play suits Jun so well is that her strength is in daring tactics and pyrotechnical combinations and these are critical in the King's Indian, which concedes White an early spatial superiority and relies on a speculative counterattack against the king. Ioseliani repeatedly overlooked the seriousness of the black threats; or else she failed to calculate deeply enough to unearth Jun's beautifully hidden tactical motifs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931214","headline":"Housing Chief Is Said To Decline Senate Seat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/14/us/housing-chief-is-said-to-decline-senate-seat.html","abstract":"  Spurning entreaties from the Texas Democratic Party, Henry G.
