Two are staged by Krasdale Foods, one at the company's gallery in White Plains, the other at its headquarters in Hunts Point, the Bronx. The third is a display of black-and-white photographs at the Gordon Parks Gallery, also in the Bronx.   The exhibition in the White Plains Gallery of Krasdale Foods is a show of Bronx solidarity, which in a sense begins with its curators, Sigmund Balka and Susan Hoeltzel. Mr. Balka is the general counsel for Krasdale, which has its headquarters in the Bronx at Hunts Point, and Ms. Hoeltzel is acting director of the Lehman College Art Gallery. All but two of the artists come from the Bronx, and Jacob Friedlander, to whom the show pays tribute, was born there, attended the High School of Science there and last year died there.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"OUTDOORS;\nStriped Bass Stirs Bitter Feud","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/sports/outdoors-striped-bass-stirs-bitter-feud.html","abstract":"The striped bass lacks the subtle beauty of the brook trout, the power of the big tuna or the exotic appeal of the mako shark or steelhead. Instead, it is nature's version of the all-purpose player, a quality clearly expressed in the striper's appearance. Although the fish has a slightly pugnacious mug, relatively large scales, and sharp tines on its dorsal fin, it is a marvel of fine proportions. \n\nThe striper's head is bold but handsome. Its iridescent silver flanks are dramatically marked with dark, horizontal stripes, and the rear half of the dorsal fin is an elegant, curved fan. But good looks alone have not allowed the striper to survive the harsh oceanic environment where life pretty much boils down to trying to eat something smaller than you before you are eaten by something bigger than you. Forged in this briny predator's carnival, the striper is a vivid illustration of the balance that can be struck between beauty and purpose.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Kelly and Marino Race the Clock","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/sports/conference-championships-kelly-and-marino-race-the-clock.html","abstract":"  Any discussion of successful active quarterbacks in the National Football League invariably leads to the mention of Buffalo's Jim Kelly and Miami's Dan Marino.

But out of the ruins rose a fairytale village that retains all its 17th-century charm. Behind the meticulously preserved Baroque facade of one of the most beautiful of the buildings built at that time, at 29 Hauptstrasse (Main Street), is the new and delightful Luther Hotel and Restaurant, which was awarded a Michelin star in 1991.    The house and its outbuildings were first restored in 1769, the date carved in the lintel over the front door. They were refurbished most recently between 1988 and 1991, after the owner deeded the house to the town with the proviso that it be put to some public use. Since Freinsheim is on the popular Weinstrasse, or wine highway, from Bockenheim in the north to the French border at Wissembourg in the south, the town fathers chose to convert it into an exquisite small hotel and restaurant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"The Durability of Doo-Wop","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/arts/pop-music-the-durability-of-doo-wop.html","abstract":"  In a country whose new President imitates Elvis, it may well be time to pay homage to doo-wop.

That philosophy has inspired some of the world's great art, and it would be hard to find it more persuasively expressed than in the extraordinary metal Buddhist figures in \"The Golden Age of Sculpture From Sri Lanka\" at the Arthur M.

Searching for answers to a musical question or for an eyewitness report on some of the more important cultural history of the 20th century would incite two types of replies -- the \"Umm, yeah . . .\" sort, a bit gruff, mostly bored, and obviously the response of a person watching television, or an articulate expression of what he had experienced in the course of a life that moved from rural South Carolina to the streets of the major cities of the world.   Nearly 60 years of involvement in show business in America left Gillespie, who died this month at age 75, a profound judge of character, somebody who had seen just about every type of scam, malfeasance and insincerity. An unprepared interviewer would turn into prey, and many were left with nothing. He had been burned in print before -- a long profile in The New Yorker in 1948 poked fun at him and be-boppers. He spent a good portion of the late 1950's and early 1960's a lost figure in a music he helped invent; be-bop was yesterday's music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Public & Private; Time to Tackle This","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/opinion/public-private-time-to-tackle-this.html","abstract":"  Talk to administrators or counselors at shelters for battered women, and sooner or later they will tell you the one about the football game and the beating.

In BERTHE MORISOT'S IMAGES OF WOMEN (Harvard University, $45), Anne Higonnet declares that \"Morisot became a painter despite being a woman,\" then argues that the painter's association with the Impressionist movement was an extraordinary feat. However, this thoroughly researched study shows that such was not the case. Morisot (1841-95) profited from her upper-middle-class origins -- for example, she studied painting under Corot with the support of her mother. Her marriage in 1874 to Eugene Manet, the brother of the painter Edouard, made her socially and professionally a member of Impressionist circles. Little wonder that Morisot showed her work in all but one of the Impressionist exhibitions. Ms. Higonnet, who teaches art history at Wellesley College, devotes very little space to Morisot's style or technique, instead focusing on the sociopolitical forces that shaped her paintings. Even though the 1894 painting \"Julie Dreaming\" boldly depicts a sensual, languid adolescent, Ms. Higonnet writes, overall Morisot's work \"reflected a middle-class ideology of domestic femininity.\" This observation seems fair, even though Ms. Higonnet then argues that Morisot wished to be freed \"from the cultural constraints of gender.\" The author's unstable definition of the painter's relationship to her sex, and of the place of the female artist in 19th-century France, is disappointing and ultimately irritating. It is a pity that ideology should be put to work toward a belated recognition of Berthe Morisot; her talent alone should suffice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Southern Liberals in Love","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/books/southern-liberals-in-love.html","abstract":"FAVORITE SONS\n\nBy John Russell.\n318 pp. Chapel Hill, N.C.:\nAlgonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $19.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"POSTINGS: Housing and Commerce; Seeds of Change on 6th Ave.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/realestate/postings-housing-and-commerce-seeds-of-change-on-6th-ave.html","abstract":"  The announcement last week that the four largest flower wholesalers were pulling up roots from the traditional Flower District on the Avenue of the Americas was only part of an economic development story that promises dramatic change in the area.

The garden, scheduled to open last week, features tropical plants, especially bromeliads, set amid cascading streams in a greenhouse roughly 40 by 50 feet at the western end of the 3.5-acre conservatory complex. The project was a collaboration between Mr. Burle Marx and Conrad Hamerman, a landscape architect in Philadelphia.   Bromeliads, which include such plants as pineapples and Spanish moss, absorb moisture through hairlike scales covering their leaves. In the Cascade Garden, fog emitters spray mists to maintain 80 percent humidity; 3,000 feet of heating cable wound through the beds and in the walls and structural columns keep the plants' roots above 60 degrees. The designers were inspired by the runnels of water that trickle down tropical mountainsides, Mr. Hamerman said, but he noted the garden was \"an abstraction of nature, not an imitation.\" Steel columns and other structural elements of the greenhouse, which was built in 1958, played a big role in the garden's design, which has a strong vertical sweep. Some 35 tons of Pennsylvania mica from local quarries were used in the stonework.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"When Shakespeare Wasn't for Everyone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/theater/sunday-view-when-shakespeare-wasn-t-for-everyone.html","abstract":"  I don't suppose the acting profession requires much defending these days, but if ever I'm called upon to come up with an eloquent explanation of why actors act, I know whom I'll quote.

This link between a city's psyche and the fate of its football players may seem strange to those not swept up by National Football League delirium. Why, skeptics are apt to wonder, would a big city invest so much of itself in the vicissitudes of a major sports franchise?\n\nFor a city like Buffalo, the answer lies in its own past. Like Cleveland, Detroit and Pittsburgh, cities with similarly checkered economic stories, Buffalo looks to its big-league sports teams for the gratification denied it by history. Misfortunes, whether a plant closing, a toxic event or a botched Super Bowl, have a way of shaping a city. And while they rarely admit to it, Buffalonians are a little haunted by a past that reminds them how close and yet how far away their dreams are. It's as though a strange spell were hanging over their heads -- like dark clouds coming off Lake Erie.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"A Campus That Dances In the Visions Of Stamford","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/a-campus-that-dances-in-the-visions-of-stamford.html","abstract":"THE history professor gathered his notes and peered across a podium at the 25 people who had seated themselves among three times as many folding chairs at the new Stamford Center for the Arts.

I spent less than $5 for a boneless venison roast big enough to serve six people, and venison medallions were cheaper than hamburger in New York. Just about everything else in London costs more than twice what it does in New York.    Wild Scottish venison is now so plentiful it is almost valueless. (As anyone who has a house in the country knows, deer breed like rabbits, and in the absence of such natural enemies as wolves, their numbers continue to expand at an extraordinarily high rate.) In Britain, wild venison is sold in supermarkets as boneless joints, roasts and steaks as well as diced and marinated and in prepared meals.

The \"how\" of his revolution -- the technique of it -- is one of the things he has been teaching in his annual choral seminars at Carnegie Hall, the third of which culminates this afternoon in a performance of the Berlioz Requiem there.   The historical place of Mr. Shaw and his revolution is within the 20th-century tradition of refining, elaborating and reconsidering the reproduction of music. Over the last 100 years, orchestral disciplinarians have achieved unimagined levels of precision, unanimity and nuance; brilliant players have cultivated new technical possibilities (and solo careers) on instruments that were not previously the province of virtuosity; educators have assimilated sophisticated psychological and physiological insights into the science of teaching.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"In Norwalk, 'The Play's the Thing'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/theater-in-norwalk-the-play-s-the-thing.html","abstract":"  \"THEATER about theater.\" That's what artistic director Ugo N.

Hall knows a place, which he describes with affectionate horror in HARD AGROUND (Delacorte, $22), where lazy treasure seekers will fork over $500 for a dubious map to a sunken ship laden with 17th-century Mayan gold. In the avaricious climate of this place, a serious scavenger could just as easily save the 500 bucks and get more reliable information through theft and murder. The author calls this degraded place Miami, and he mourns its physical and moral wreckage with splenetic, comic rage.   Hap Tyler, the driven hero of Mr. Hall's fourth imaginative crime novel, sees himself as representing \"the insipid, watered-down, failure-prone\" genetic strain of an illustrious ancestor who was one of Florida's first land developers. When Hap's brother, an archeologist who has the inside track on that lost ship, is murdered by ruthless booty hunters, Hap bravely launches himself on a wild crusade to avenge his brother and to save their ancestral home from inventively wicked characters. Mr. Hall, whose earlier, moodier novels were set in the environmentally fragile Florida Keys, has lightened his imagistic style and found a lode of flashier inspiration on the glittery Gold Coast. Although poetic lyricism fades in this bright setting, it's the right place for the vivid characters and their bold adventures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Per-Bag Garbage System Creeps Along","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/perbag-garbage-system-creeps-along.html","abstract":"THE Robertsons on Chatham Street pay $4 a week to dispose of their household garbage, while on the other side of this Morris County community, the Stemmlers on Edge Hill Road pay $6. \n\nThat difference reflects the quantity of garbage the two families set out each week, the cost standard since Chatham Borough began assessing residents on a fee-per-container basis last fall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"If It's a Saturday, It Must Be Election Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/if-it-s-a-saturday-it-must-be-election-day.html","abstract":"  PEOPLE who see advertisements proclaiming a special election in the 29th State Senate District on Jan. 23 may think they include a typographical error.

It's true that archeologists are excavating graves from the fort along present-day Alameda Street, and that the Pima County Courthouse is an amiable example of Spanish Colonial Revival kitsch. But in general, downtown Tucson has papered over its Hispanic origins, with a few exceptions. There are two downtown districts, both within walking distance of El Presidio Park, that bring Hispanic Tucson vividly to life. In one, directly north of the park and also called El Presidio, it's possible to walk Tucson's evolution from a Mexican to an American town in one block; the other is a compact neighborhood of more than 150 plastered adobe houses called the Barrio Historico.\n\nThe barrio occupies 13 blocks just south of the very contemporary Tucson Community Center; its main streets are Convent, Meyer and Main. In spite of gentrification, the neighborhood seems frozen somewhere in a purely Hispanic past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Magnetic Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Pain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/magnetic-therapy-to-relieve-arthritis-pain.html","abstract":"WHEN Harold Goldman developed bleeding ulcers from the drugs he was taking for arthritis, his doctor warned him to stop taking the medication and have a knee replacement. \n\n\"Even with the arthritis, I was used to bowling and playing golf and tennis,\" Mr. Goldman, 73, of Merrick, said. \"I used to take the painkillers before and after I'd play.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Laura Whitman, Paul Provost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/style/engagements-laura-whitman-paul-provost.html","abstract":"  July wedding plans have been announced by Mr. and Mrs. William F.

For Mr. Bentsen, who met with Federal regulators on the businessman's behalf four months before he bought the stock, an investment of $100,000 came to be worth at least $600,000 three years later.

The monthly maintenance charges were $350, but they have now risen to $598. In 1990 and 1991, a 13th-month assessment was made to defray rising costs. In 1992, two extra months of charges were again requested as special assessments. I have been paying the regular maintenance of $598 on time but have been unable to meet the last two assessments, totaling $1,169.00. I have recently been asked to pay these arrears and my suspicion is that yet another 13th assessment will be requested soon. The regular maintenance also goes up every January. Can you tell me whether these assessments are legal? Am I obligated to pay them? . . . M. Williams, Manhattan Answer: Yes. Common charges, according to Richard Siegler, a Manhattan lawyer, are generally imposed by the board of managers to defray the operations of the condominium, and they are borne by everybody in proportion to their interest in the condominium. He said the common charges could be changed as often as necessary to insure that the expenses were paid.

Another recent play, \"The Ride Down Mount Morgan,\" which opened in London in 1991, has not yet been seen in the United States, whereas a production of \"The Last Yankee\" opens in London on Jan. 27.    The evening at the Y, sponsored by the Unterberg Poetry Center, Mr. Miller read from \"The Last Yankee,\" which he described as \"a comedy about a tragedy, and the tragedy is the way we live.\" The play, involving two couples who meet when the wives are patients in a mental hospital, stars Tom Aldredge, Frances Conroy, Rose Gregorio and John Heard and is directed by John Tillinger.

Here are excerpts from some early reviews. \"More than Nijinsky, he is Vestris, who was known as 'the god of the dance.' \"  Olivier Merlin,   Le Monde (Paris), June 21, 1961    \"To innate romanticism Nureyev adds a variety of gifts. Technically he is endowed with a neat figure, natural turn-out, exceptional elevation, impeccable turns and beats, strong but sensitive feet (rare in a man) and a suppleness laced with a fiery dash of Slav temperament which permits him more grace than most men could get away with. When he makes one of his great loping runs like a cheetah caught behind bars, he seems to be made of more elastic material than normal humanity.\"  Alexander Bland,   The Observer (London), Feb. 23, 1962     \"As to his beats, we have not, I think, seen their like before. Soft, without strain, without vestige of hurry, with the feet fluttering as though motivated by a bird's wing rather than by a man's muscle, his entrechats are beyond description.\"  A. H. Franks,   The Dancing Times (London), March 1962    \"A pop dancer -- that's what we've got -- a pop dancer, at last. What the telly did for art, what Billy Graham did for religion, Nureyev has done for ballet. . . . Pop dancers, like pop singers, have got to have a gimmick or some special thing about them, like tears or a wiggle or a half-starved little-boy look; and I think Nureyev's thing is that even when he is behaving in a withdrawn and gentlemanly way you feel that he may suddenly snarl and bite you in the neck.\"  Richard Buckle,   The Sunday Times of London, May 20, 1962   \"Nureyev, with his shock of unruly hair, his sullen expression, seems indeed, at first glance, like a beatnik in ballet tights. . . . But there is nothing crude or gauche about this animal. He is catlike in both his elegance of action and his enigmatic expression. The discipline of a premier danseur appears to cloak a creature of wild and beautiful movement impulses.\" Walter Terry,   The New York Herald Tribune, June 10, 1962   \"From the very beginning of the 'Flower Festival' pas de deux Mr. Nureyev showed why he has been an object of dance attention during the past year. It is because of his extraordinary personality projection, which is the result of a natural stage instinct developed with the most careful calculation, and because of the unusual quality of his dance movements. He has an acute consciousness of every part of his body from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers and toes; he knows that every little inflection of it counts and he sees to it that the audience is made aware of each inflection.\"  Allen Hughes,   The New York Times, Oct. 22, 1962  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Katie's Ordeal: Seeking Friendship, Finding 16 Days of Terror","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/katie-s-ordeal-seeking-friendship-finding-16-days-of-terror.html","abstract":"  Katie Beers's voyage through the trapdoors of a man's twisted mind began as a lonely girl's dream outing: a birthday shopping expedition for the kinds of things her family never bought her, followed by a trip to the video arcade.

Its Egyptian setting, after all, is a fanciful affectation: apart from the pyramids, which do double duty as Egyptian and Masonic symbols, the work's connections with Egypt are tenuous. The Masonic ritual toward which the tale so elegantly leads is, mythical Egyptophilia notwithstanding, entirely Northern European. And its characters seem almost Alpine. Papageno, for one, may have a connection with the bird-men of Egyptian hieroglyphics, but surely those fierce-looking figures are not meant to be Papageno-like dunces. Indeed, the work's blend of low comedy and high seriousness argues that the setting is the least of the work's concerns.

The singer produces a basic note as well as its harmonics, which have a flute- or whistle-like tone.   Tuva, a former Soviet autonomous oblast bordered by Russia and Mongolia, is one of the few places where overtone singing is practiced. Other throat singers, such as the Gyoto Tantric Choir and new-age innovator David Hykes, place the technique in a spiritual context, emphasizing the discipline it requires and its meditative qualities.

Hillary wants me to cut 45 minutes out of the speech. Tell her there's not a superfluous word in it. \"How about those 6,000 words explaining what GATT is?\" she asks. \"How about those 5,000 words explaining the difference between a macroeconomist and a mackerel sky?\" Luckily we're interrupted by phone call from G. Bush. \"Friendly advice,\" Bush says: \"Whatever you do, don't keep a diary.\" Apparently there's nothing prosecutors like more than spending dozens of millions of dollars trying to subpoena diaries. This is the last diary entry I'll ever make. Not that I'm worried about being prosecuted. It's just that diary pages are too small to hold the forty or fifty thousand words I'll need every night to do justice to the events of my day. Albert Gore's Diary   Worried all day about the rain forest burning. Tipper begs me to give it up for the next 24 hours. She thinks it's worrying about all that burning wood that makes me look so wooden when standing beside Bill. Yes, empathy for the death of trees may be showing up in my posture as rigor mortis. After breakfast tomorrow I'll try to worry about global warming. Senator Nunn's Diary   It could be me up there tomorrow except for those popularity polls -- just one short year ago -- showing no earthly human could possibly beat George Bush. Richard Nixon's Diary   Of course I didn't expect Clinton to offer me a front-row seat for the swearing-in. That would be wrong. Should he ask me to head an emergency program to prevent the former Soviet Union from collapsing into a chaos perilous to the entire world, I shall accept it as a great American uniquely qualified for the assignment -- ought to accept it without pointing out that Clinton was not so quick to recognize my stature when invitations to the swearing-in were being handed out.  Marilyn Quayle's Diary   Dan thinks increasingly of being the next President. This morning he asked, if I became First Lady, would I let him invite Murphy Brown to the White House. I asked why in the world he would want to do that. He said he thinks his attack on Murphy Brown cost votes in the last election and believes inviting her to the White House would show he has nothing against her, thus winning over her supporters and helping himself to get elected. I pointed out that if I were the First Lady he would already have been elected, so wouldn't need the Murphy Brown vote. \"Good thinking, Marilyn,\" he told me, as usual. Barbara Bush's Diary   Keeping my eye upon the doughnut and not upon the hole, thank Heaven George will no longer have to prove he's just plain folks by stuffing himself on pork rinds that give him those awful gas pains.  Mario Cuomo's Diary   Sure it could be me up there tomorrow except for those popularity polls showing no human on earth could beat George Bush, in addition to many, many other factors which tempt me to contradict myself and say, No, it could not be me up there tomorrow. Tomorrow! Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace, as Shakespeare observed. But I shall save that for my journal, not throw it away on a flimsy diary. Some think my journal has literary merit, and literature will always outlast the governorship of New York. Its other advantage is that you don't have to go to Albany to do it.  Saddam Hussein's Diary   The hour of glory approaches. The father of evil, the Satan of Satans, the poisonous begetter of mothers of all battles will be forever stripped of his power tomorrow. As I have commanded the author of destiny to write, \"It is writ that when the abominable Bush is struck from power, the rule of Saddam will roll on unbroken upon mighty blasts of heated air.\" Powerful is my prose.

This Requiem hid its origins; it had an organic character, with each movement establishing its own pulse and breath. The performance seemed almost improvised, so natural were its gestures.    Yet behind this performance was a six-day workshop run by Mr. Shaw in which participants from 36 states sang sustained monotones, walked around in circles, counted beats like first-year music students and clapped rhythms. Before the Offertorium could create that other-worldly quality, the singers had to learn to sing without accent but with precise articulation. Before the setting of the \"Salva Me\" text could seem a matter of devout respiration, Mr. Shaw tried conducting three beats to the singers' four -- so they would end up feeling only the pulse of the first. Some early readings focused only on rhythms, sung softly: \"one, and, two, and, tree, and\" (the \"tree\" sound being quicker and more precise than an elongated \"three\"). The singers also, unusually, sang the lines of the piano transcription or joined, in unison, on individual vocal parts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/nyregion/c-corrections-055793.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Thursday about Thomas B.

Earthwinds, a 300-foot-high assemblage resembling a gigantic hourglass, was designed to fly nonstop around the world to achieve the last major landmark in lighter-than-air aviation. The craft and its three-member crew rose majestically above a snow-covered Nevada airfield last Tuesday to the cheers of a crowd that included former astronauts, champion balloonists, actors, business executives, airplane pilots, aeronautical engineers, systems analysts and other experts.

Last week was typical. Dr. Seeff saw 15 patients, and 13 had hepatitis C, a tenacious, insidious and sometimes fatal virus that infects the liver and that only now is becoming recognized as a public health threat.   The virus is a medical mystery. Ever since a test to detect it in blood became available in 1990, doctors have found more and more people who are infected but have no symptoms. Some 20 to 40 percent of people coming to inner-city hospitals have the virus, as do 80 percent of intravenous drug users. Yet, to doctors' puzzlement, some 40 percent of hepatitis C carriers say they never used intravenous drugs, never had a transfusion before 1990 when blood was first screened for the virus, and have no apparent reason for contracting the infection by blood-to-blood contact.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Humbled in Hartford: UConn Loses by 17","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/sports/college-basketball-humbled-in-hartford-uconn-loses-by-17.html","abstract":"  Another stellar performance by Othella Harrington, Georgetown's freshman center, opened the way for the Hoyas tonight.

It may well be that at this point, nearly 56 years after the composer's death, it's only the music that matters. But Gershwin fans interested in peeking behind the scrim erected by the composer's family will have an opportunity to reconsider the composer's life and times in May, when Joan Peyser's biography, \"The Memory of All That: The Life of George Gershwin,\" is due from Simon & Schuster.    The book, like Ms. Peyser's racy 1987 study of Leonard Bernstein, is a psychobiography rather than a musicological study: hints about Gershwin's private and interior life are gleaned from his letters, from his comments as recalled by his associates and from Ira Gershwin's song lyrics, which Ms. Peyser says represent a veiled biography of the composer. Gershwin himself is painted as narcissistic and insensitive, but also insecure and disappointed by his inability to gain a foothold in the \"serious\" music world.  The Unacknowledged Offspring    But there is also a good helping of gossip, and the section of the book that will undoubtedly be most widely talked about is Ms. Peyser's discussion of Alan Gershwin, an impoverished songwriter who was born in 1926, whose original name was Albert Schneider and who grew up convinced that he was the composer's son.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930119","headline":"Rumors of U.S. Superplane Appear Unfounded","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/science/rumors-of-us-superplane-appear-unfounded.html","abstract":"  RUMORS and reported sightings of a secret American superplane have been proliferating lately almost as abundantly as yarns about unidentified flying objects.
