Here are a handful of his worst days on the job.  April 19, 1992    Torborg, less than a month into his tenure with the Mets, confesses to having underestimated the difficulty of managing in the National League. \"Our pitcher always seems to be coming up,\" Torborg said after a tactically suspect loss against the Expos 24 hours earlier. June 26, 1992   In a painful version of his daily radio show, Torborg is grilled about the coverup for Bobby Bonilla's phone call from the dugout the day before. The manager winds up apologizing to \"all the New York media\" for any lack of candor, real or perceived. Aug. 4, 1992    The Mets, only four games back of the Pirates and lacking their top players, respond to the manager's call for a \"critical win\" in Pittsburgh by losing in 12 innings. The Mets, who would wind up 4-14 on the season against the Pirates, go on to complete the decisive road trip 0-6 to fall hopelessly out of the race. Sep. 1, 1992    Torborg gets involved in a profane and physical confrontation with outfielder Vince Coleman on the field after Coleman was ejected for arguing a strike call. The scene dramatized what had been a season-long frustration for many Mets, namely that Torborg's failure to argue with umpires began to seem like a failure to stand up for his players. April 11, 1993    Torborg chooses not to discipline or criticize Bobby Bonilla after the outfielder's run-in with a reporter in the clubhouse at Shea Stadium. The Mets then go out and lose their third straight home game to the Astros.  April 25, 1993    The Mets squander a comeback from an 8-3 deficit and lose 9-8 to the Padres on an unearned run. April 26, 1993   Torborg opts to hide the cause of Dwight Gooden's shoulder injury after a clubhouse mishap shortly before Gooden is scheduled to start. It is later revealed that Vince Coleman inadvertently struck Gooden with a golf club while practicing his swing an hour before game time. April 29, 1993    Bret Saberhagen, who won't win a game against a non-expansion club before Torborg is fired, is bombed for three home runs in a 10-5 defeat to the Giants. The Mets commit five errors.  May 2, 1993    A second straight defeat in San Diego underscores another of the club's weaknesses: the bullpen is 0-10  May 8, 1993   Torborg, who said upon his hiring that all players would do all things his way, sees Bobby Bonilla fail to run full out from first base on an eighth-inning flyball by Howard Johnson, even though the Mets are trailing the Marlins by two runs. Torborg does not challenge Bonilla himself and ultimately has to act as a peacemaker after Bonilla flys into a rage at third base coach Mike Cubbage, who criticizes Bonilla's lack of effort on the field. Bonilla is neither fined nor reprimanded. May 9, 1993    After enduring the ignominy of having to identify a May series against the Marlins as critical, the Mets lose their second straight to the expansion club, securing occupancy of last place in the N.L. East. May 14, 1993    The Mets get a season-high 14 hits but lose to the Expos, 8-7. Frank Tanana gives up five runs on one hit in the first inning as errors and hit batsmen doom the Mets. The one-run loss is the first of three that weekend against the Expos. The Mets wind up 2-10 in one-run decisions under Torborg. May 17, 1993    \"Jeff Must Go\" is heard at Shea as the Pirates beat up Dwight Gooden and the bullpen in a 9-4 loss to the Pirates.   May 18, 1993    This time the Mets get 17 hits, but the ultimate result is a fifth straight loss, a 10-8 embarrassment to the Pirates that leaves New York at 12-25, the second worst record in baseball.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930520","headline":"Five for Campaign Reform?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/20/opinion/five-for-campaign-reform.html","abstract":"  There are moments when elected lawmakers must decide whether to break with their party's leadership or toe the party line on an issue of fundamental public importance.

Torborg was fired half an hour after the underachieving Mets came out of character to beat the Pirates, 6-4, in 10 innings, winning for only the 13th time in 38 games. He could have taken a lot of people -- very deserving people -- down with him. Torborg would not, could not do so.

Learning his contract might not be renewed, he floated the rumor that he was or might be a Communist. His colleagues, who would be happy to see him go, rallied around him on grounds of academic freedom. He kept his job. The case of Prof. Leonard Jeffries of the City College of New York bears some resemblance to this fiction. \n\nThere are excellent reasons why he should not be chairman of the black studies department -- reasons long available to the college's administrators. Although he served as chairman for 20 years, a review of the standard indexes of academic publications reveals absolutely nothing under his name. Besides, so lengthy a term is peculiar.

Orpheus's music had, poets tell us, the power to make trees and mountains bow their heads; it could draw iron tears from the Lord of the Underworld. In Philip Glass's new opera, \"Orphee,\" which is receiving its world premiere performances here at the American Repertory Theater until July 10 (and which will also be seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall), Orpheus is turned into a hip French poet. This is fortunate: the music did not have to face the challenge of matching its mythic origins.   The opera is based on Jean Cocteau's 1949 film \"Orphee,\" so it did not have to demonstrate great gifts of poesy either. Cocteau set the film in contemporary France, and he avoided any demonstration of his poet's achievements. The opera libretto, adapted by Mr. Glass and edited by Robert Brustein, the company's artistic director, is just a shortened version of the movie screenplay. The opera reproduces nearly all of Cocteau's surreal alterations to the Greek myth: the motorcyclists who are the agents of Death; the mirrors through which the world of the dead can be entered; the rubber gloves that give passage through these zones; the radio that sputters odd fragments of Morse code and Appolinaire's poetry; the icy Princess who captures the souls of the dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"Judge Dismisses Contempt Case Against Close-Mouthed Lawyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/nyregion/judge-dismisses-contempt-case-against-close-mouthed-lawyer.html","abstract":"  A Manhattan judge has thrown out a highly unusual criminal contempt charge against a lawyer who refused to tell a grand jury who had paid her legal fees.

and arguably the most artistically vigorous segment of American pop music right now. As both Clint Black and Wynonna Judd, two of country music's biggest stars, demonstrated at Radio City Music Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the music has expanded and modernized its vocabulary over the last decade without losing its soul or its sense of identity.   If most country music still directs itself to white, rural working people, it has also become increasingly suburbanized and has assimilated many of the stylistic elements of old-time rock-and-roll, a genre that has come to seem quaint to a younger, post-punk rock audience. And unlike rock and hip-hop, country music reveres traditional standards of songwriting craft and celebrates polished voices, instrumental virtuosity and ensemble teamwork. If its songs are often formulaic, they are unfailingly and reassuringly tuneful.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/style/chronicle-417393.html","abstract":"  DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR., who still looks like the dashing swashbuckler he played in his movie career despite his 83 years, was cited on Wednesday in San Francisco by CARE, the relief organization, for his naval service in World War II and his post-war efforts in delivering CARE packages to starving war victims.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-91843457153.html","abstract":"1943: Roosevelt's 'Gosh'","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"U.S. Defines Mental Illness As Standard for Treatment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/us/us-defines-mental-illness-as-standard-for-treatment.html","abstract":"  The Federal Government has officially defined \"serious mental illness\" as it prepares for the first national estimate of the number of people suffering from a condition that keeps them from leading a normal life.

Written in 1965, five years before Mishima's ritual suicide, the play is about the Marquis de Sade \"as seen through women's eyes.\" De Sade never appears on stage, but we hear in grotesque and sometimes glowing detail about the paradoxes of his perversity.   Mishima, who evidently identified with de Sade, paired opposites: the sacred and the profane, the beautiful and the horrific. The greater truth about the character of de Sade is that he is whatever the women and the world want him to be. For one of the women he is a lovable vampire. At the end of the play there is the suggestion that his decadence has not only destroyed women but may also have contributed to the French Revolution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"Byrd Stalks November Ghosts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/sports/football-byrd-stalks-november-ghosts.html","abstract":"  As the car entered the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan, heading toward Giants Stadium, Dennis Byrd felt a tinge of excitement and nervousness.

Kelly has surprised some of those who thought he would be too much of a police insider to change anything about the department. Indeed, Mr. Kelly, a 30-year police veteran, is getting good reviews from unlikely sources, including some prominent blacks at first skeptical of having a white as commissioner. Others who monitor the police point to his appointment of an outspoken chief to evaluate community policing. The chief's job it to find bad news and tell it to his boss. Page 1. NEW SCHOOL BOARDS TO RESEMBLE THE OLD   Even though more new faces were elected to community school boards in the May 4 election than ever before, the ideological cast of those boards is unlikely to change. The new conservative board members, for example, will mostly join boards that were already conservative. But dissenting voices added in many districts could mean a proliferation of curriculum disputes in the city's 32 districts. Page 1. GIULIANI PICKS A RUNNING PARTNER   Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, reached across party lines to introduce his choice for City Council president. The candidate, Susan D. Alter, a 14-year Democratic councilwoman from Brooklyn, said her decision \"was easier than I would have liked it to have been.\" Page 23. FEARS RAISED BY STUDENTS' PRICKING   At least 11 children were pricked while at their school, P.S. 46 in Harlem, and before the police determined that the weapon was just a safety pin, the children feared that they had been infected with AIDS by a hypodermic needle and were rushed to hospital emergency rooms. The parents are critical of the school's handling of the episode. Page 23. Five months after she apparently arrived from Germany, a woman was found dead under a footbridge at Kennedy International Airport, where she apparently had been living. Page 23. REGION  ARREST MADE IN 11 RAPES   The police say a partial fingerprint led to the arrest of a Bronx man suspected of 11 rapes in four counties. He has been charged with robbing and raping a young woman in her Yonkers home. Investigators had nicknamed the man they were seeking \"Scarface\" because of a three-inch scar all the victims said they had seen on his right cheek. Page 24. ANOTHER HEARING IN GLEN RIDGE CASE   A New Jersey appeals court has ordered a special hearing into whether Christopher Archer, one of three men convicted of assaulting a mildly retarded schoolmate, is too dangerous to remain free. The issue is another woman's assertion that he sexually assaulted her at Boston College. The student never filed a formal complaint against Mr. Archer and he has never been charged with a crime in the case. Page 24.
