It was not an outstanding time. The level of imagination was generally low. Choreographers and dancers know their craft better than ever. But that craft often seemed to be put in the service of well-made dances that took few risks, meandering along on frequently tortuous routes to nowhere. And yet there were a reassuring number of compelling works and performances.    Given the country's increasing preoccupation with social issues, there were surprisingly few dance pieces dealing with such subjects as poverty and prejudice in ways more universal than spontaneous personal response. Dance may have been affected by the general fatigue of the world around it. Only Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's \"Shelter,\" a piece about homelessness that was presented by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center, took an important issue and treated it with formal grandeur. Ms. Zollar, who created the work for her own Urban Bush Women company, approached homelessness from a distance yet with passion, and it worked.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"For Norman Esiason, a Chip Off the Old Block Is Boomer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/nyregion/for-norman-esiason-a-chip-off-the-old-block-is-boomer.html","abstract":"THE New York Jets preseason practice field at Hofstra University was rung by Long Islanders watching the men running, throwing, catching and kicking on the greensward.

After an arduous journey of two years, they reached the \"Forbidden City\" of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet and the home of its incarnated God-King, the Dalai Lama. Once there, they stayed on for five remarkable years, first as tolerated refugees, then as trusted officials in the Tibetan Government.    One of the men, Heinrich Harrer -- now 81, with a distinguished career as a photojournalist behind him -- recorded his experiences in the now-classic book \"Seven Years in Tibet,\" first published in 1954. Part field report, part diary, it is the study not only of an insular culture but of the author's gradual shift in attitude from skepticism at what he took to be the crudities of a foreign land to a profound sense of respect and finally love. At least as evocative as his words, however, are the hundreds of stunning photographs that Mr. Harrer took during these years. Using a Leica camera and film that had serendipitously found its way to wartime Lhasa, he became the first person to visually document a centuries-old culture that is all but extinct today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Wrong Ammunition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/l-wrong-ammunition-396393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   If you must send such a big gun as Maureen Dowd out to shoot such a little bitty duck as Roger Clinton out there in his Hollywood barrel (\"Bubbrother,\" Aug. 15), you should at least insist that she understand the meaning of the words she fires with such relish at her target.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"The Popes Could Look It Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/books/in-short-nonfiction-the-popes-could-look-it-up.html","abstract":"  Can a collection of books save a city? The question sounds naive today, yet the authors of the eight essays in ROME REBORN: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture (Library of Congress/Yale University, $55) argue persuasively that the Vatican Library restored the splendor of Rome. The collection was the torch by which the Renaissance papacy guided itself, and its culture, out of the Dark Ages. The library allowed popes to \"place knowledge systematically at the service of governance.\" The essayists in \"Rome Reborn\" present the vast range of the library's holdings -- from astronomy and philosophy to medicine and cartography -- and describe how the collection expanded. Particularly engaging are an essay on music and the papal choir by Richard Sherr, who teaches music at Smith College, and an essay on the Vatican's Oriental collection by Howard L. Goodman, who teaches East Asian studies at Harvard. Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton who edited \"Rome Reborn,\" contributes a fascinating study, \"The Ancient City Restored: Archeology, Ecclesiastical History and Egyptology,\" detailing how the library influenced the physical transformation of the city. The volume includes more than 200 color illustrations, including beautiful reproductions from editions of Virgil, Euclid and Aristotle. Despite some unevenness in the essays, \"Rome Reborn\" is successful; even when the essays falter, the collection speaks for itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Alice Cornish and Christopher White","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/weddings-alice-cornish-and-christopher-white.html","abstract":"  Alice Lynn Cornish, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Albert E.

A visiting American writer once groused that it made him feel claustrophobic, but Jerusalemites, non-Jews as well as Jews, would find his complaint strange. True, most shops and restaurants close (although not nearly as many as a few years ago) and sometimes this causes inconvenience. But in a city of palpable tension and permanent strife, the enforced quiet of the Sabbath is a spiritual and social massage for a weary body politic, a gift beyond price.   A succession of Jewish holy days, starting with the New Year, Rosh ha-Shanah, on the evening of Sept. 15, will provide the equivalent of many Sabbaths for a month. Most extraordinary is Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Sept. 25 this year, when local custom dictates that even non-observant Jews leave their cars at home, giving pedestrians and children on bicycles full control of deserted streets. The holy period ends with the long festival of Succoth, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/nyregion/westchester-guide-346094.html","abstract":"  KENNEL CLUB DOG SHOW   Picture it: More than 2,300 dogs, all purebred, putting their best paws forward at Lyndhurst in Tarrytown next weekend in the 76th Annual Westchester Kennel Club Dog Show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"RELIGIONS ENDORSE PEACEFUL PATHS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/us/religions-endorse-peaceful-paths.html","abstract":"  After a week of colorful and sometimes divisive events, an assembly of religious leaders from around the world closed this evening with an appeal from the Dalai Lama for religious peace.

Anglers are not. Sooner or later, knees stiffen, backs tighten, eyesight blurs and bodies succumb to the illnesses and accidents that bedevil us all and the short slopes that separate bank from stream become impassable obstacles for disabled and elderly. Joan Stoliar, who has long been the Den Mother to New York fly-fishers, decided something had to be done. She could not, of course, alter the mortality side of the equation but she felt we all could make it easier for less able anglers to get to the fishing. The result of Stoliar's resolution has been Project Access, the nation's first attempt at providing the disabled with access to public fishing streams.   The Project Access sites, on the Beaverkill, are marked by a simple wood sign reading \"Access.\" \"The whole idea is to bring disabled and able-bodied anglers together, not to segregate them,\" Stoliar explained as she reflected on the catalyst for the project. \"Dave Olesan is a good friend from Theodore Gordon Flyfishers who happens to need crutches to get around. He loves to fish and I love to fish with him and there was no place where we could fish together on the Beaverkill.

The aprons, with their dangling yards of stringlike ties, are baffling to many when seen on a store hanger. But some women were not put off. Among the designers who put the apron back in style are Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, both from Belgium. The strings create a high or low waist and often crisscross in back over T-shirts, tailored blouses, turtleneck sweaters or leotards. Polly Mellen, center, the creative director of Allure magazine, wore her checked apron as a midcalf wraparound dress teamed with a white T-shirt. Other women topped slim, ankle-length skirts with different lengths of wraparound aprons. One of the most popular was a black apron that young women wore in the evening. The dresses provide a sophisticated counterpoint to 70's revivalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Dresden Bombing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/travel/l-dresden-bombing-070493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: My impression of Dresden was quite different from Bernice Rothschild's (Letters to the Editor, Aug. 15).

Along with serving as health adviser to the Clinton and Madison schools, Dr. Sklaire is chairman of the school health committee of the Connecticut chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nWith more and more school systems facing budget constraints, the tendency has been to cut health services, despite the fact that children today are faced with health-care considerations that are increasingly complex, Dr. Sklaire said. During a recent interview, Dr. Sklaire argued that children need a reliable place they can go for medical attention and advice. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Tales From the Caddie Shack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/tales-from-the-caddie-shack.html","abstract":"CHET PAGE\nAGE: 42.\nCOURSE: Atlantic Golf Club, Bridgehampton, L.I.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Jeffrey Schaffer and Laura Zeligman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/engagements-jeffrey-schaffer-and-laura-zeligman.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Gerald L.

In the 60's it passed from swinging London to San Francisco, in the 70's from Southern California's soft rock to British punk. The rest of the planet has never had much of a look in.   Musical innovations generally originate in America, and in particular from black music (rhythm-and-blues and soul in the 50's and 60's, funk and disco in the 70's, rap and house in the 80's). But usually it's British bands that respond quickest to black American innovations, adding a vital element of art-school conceptualism, style and attitude, then promptly selling this repackaged black American music to white America.

The Beekman Theater    Q. Who was the architect of the Beekman Theater, on the East Side of Second Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets? It is similar to the 1952 Manhattan House across the street, designed by Mayer & Whittlesey and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. . . . Thomas Mellins, Robert A.M. Stern, Architects, Manhattan.    A. Like Manhattan House, the two-story-high store, theater and bank building was built in 1952 by the New York Life Insurance Company. But its architects were Fellheimer & Wagner, often identified with bank design.   New York Life apparently decided on a low-rise development it to protect its investment in the apartment house across the street; the company also bought the entire northerly blockfront and key parts of the blockfronts on the west and south.  161 West 75th Street    Q. My apartment house at 161 West 75th Street, like a number of others on the Upper West Side, has two intertwined initials over the door, an \"A\" and something else. Whose initials? And was it the architect or developer? . . . Ivan Berger, Manhattan.    A. Your building was built in 1924 to 1926 by Anthony Paterno -- they are his initials -- and was designed by Rosario Candela. Paterno was one of four brothers, all developers, who generally worked separately. Other brothers also used their initials on buildings they put up.   Joseph Paterno's architect on 905 West End Avenue, at 104th Street, designed an elaborate cartouche with \"JP\" over the door and annotated the 1917 drawing, \"Architect is to approve the plaster model of this ornament before execution.\" Other developers, like the Halls, the Campagnas and the Crystals, also left such traces of their ownership.    I have never seen written accounts of this practice by developers, but after the turn of the century the architectural press often urged architects to \"sign\" their creations. However, only a few architects, usually designers of speculative apartment houses, regularly did this.   The Paternos started building modest walk-ups around 1900 but by the 1920's had become one of New York's reigning builder-families. Joseph Paterno built buildings like 1220 Park Avenue, at 95th Street, and 30 Sutton Place, at 58th Street; Charles put up luxury apartments as well as Hudson View Gardens and Castle Village, north of the George Washington Bridge; Michael built 775 Park Avenue, at 72d Street, and 2 East 67th Street, and Anthony built 1040 Fifth Avenue, at 85th Street.   Generally the Paternos' legible presence on their buildings decreased as their product ascended the economic ladder. On Michael Paterno's 1105 Park Avenue, built in 1922 at the corner of 89th Street, there is only the letter \"P\" and even such modest inscriptions largely vanished on their top-grade buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues. This is consistent with the development in the 1910's of a general upper-class preference for apartment houses known by their street addresses rather than by a name.  126 East 24th Street    Q. In 1945 the real estate broker Charles H. Voorhees had dinner at my apartment at 126 East 24th Street. Mr. Voorhees said that as a child he had attended a French school in the same building and that it was converted to apartments only later. Was he right? . . . Kathryn Guyler, Manhattan.    A. Yes. What is now a single structure at 126 East 24th Street was originally built as a string of four-story rowhouses in 1847 by Lawson Carter, a lawyer. They were at first occupied as private houses, but in 1856 Elie Charlier moved his \"French and English Institute for Young Gentlemen\" to at least one of the buildings.    Voorhees was born about 1860 so he could have attended the Charlier school, which accepted boys at age 7. In 1875 Charlier moved up to Central Park South between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and the Carter family hired the architects Renwick & Sands to add a floor and change the building into modest apartments.   Frances Nightingale lived there from 1904 to 1909, just as she was establishing what became the Nightingale-Bamford School. In 1939 the architect Samuel Lichtenstein modernized the ground floor and the building now has a definite tripartite effect from three different eras -- a Moderne ground floor, the original Italianate middle section and a top section with an elaborate Victorian brick cornice.  3 East 81st Street    Q. There is an interesting building (very tiny) wedged just behind 998 Fifth Avenue. Could this have been an old carriage house? . . . Sylvia Steinbrock, Manhattan.    A. The first building at 3 East 81st Street was one of a row of brownstones completed in 1879. In 1908 the actress Maxine Elliott bought the house and had the architects Hunt & Hunt redesign it with a limestone front. She occupied it with a cousin and five servants. Miss Elliott's obituary in The New York Times in 1940 described her as \"one of America's most noted actresses,\" with a 30-year career beginning with her debut in 1890.    She retired around 1920 and moved to France.   In 1928 she sold the house to the owner of 998 Fifth Avenue, the apartment building at the corner. The house was then demolished but the first-floor facade was retained with a garden behind, apparently as a light protector for the larger building. This structure, with Maxine Elliott's doorway, is what survives on the site. 910 Fifth Avenue    Q. Is it true that the white brick apartment house at 910 Fifth Avenue at 72d Street is really an older structure? The ceilings are pretty high for a postwar building. . . . John Foreman, Halstead Property Company, Manhattan.    A. You're right. Another giveaway clue is the surviving trace of limestone on the easterly lot line wall, toward Madison Avenue. In 1920 the developer Fred F. French put up a limestone-front apartment house of simplexes and duplexes of up to 18 rooms with a sheltered driveway. In 1955 the architects Sylvan and Robert Bien filed plans to add four new floors and rebuild the interior according to \"new concepts of space utilization\" as The New York Times put it in 1959.   These concepts meant apartments of three and a half to eight rooms renting for $500 to $1,415 a month. Robert Bien, now a partner at Eggers & Higgins, says changes in window patterns required the changes in the facade, which would have been done anyway.   \"In those days,\" he said, \"we wanted it to look like a new building, adding that \"white glazed brick was the most expensive, and the most elegant\" material available in the industry at the time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"The City's Rewards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/evening-hours-the-city-s-rewards.html","abstract":"  Some unplanned pyrotechnics at the Met, a waterside still life, smiles from a birthday boy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"The Men Who Would Beat O'Rourke","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/nyregion/the-men-who-would-beat-o-rourke.html","abstract":"  ALMOST every weekday morning, Andrew J.

Every day, we could see her getting stronger, gaining more confidence, growing more and more independent, glorying in her ability to do easily what her parents couldn't do at all.   Our expedition began with a 9.5-mile hike from the top of the Grand Canyon to the bottom.

After a 1-15 record in the first season, critics had a hearty laugh. And the ridicule continued as the Cowboys wheeled and dealed in trades for draft picks and built a smaller, quicker team than the big, bruising types that inhabited the National Football Conference East.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930906","headline":"Essay; Forward Together, Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/06/opinion/essay-forward-together-again.html","abstract":"  In his story of \"The Purloined Letter,\" Edgar Allan Poe showed that the best place to hide anything from avid searchers is to leave it in plain view.

Neither did the Syrian President oppose the deal, saying only that the Palestinians should decide for themselves what best suited them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930907","headline":"New Season: Redskins Rip Cowboys","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/07/sports/pro-football-new-season-redskins-rip-cowboys.html","abstract":"  If there is to be a new order in the Eastern Division of the National Conference this season, look no further than tonight's grudge match here at Robert F.
