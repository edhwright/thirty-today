The play that bears his name, a bafflingly amphibious blend of history and tragedy, was seldom performed in this century until relatively recently. And most productions and analyses of \"The Life and Death of King John\" have tended to emphasize the more dynamic character of the Bastard, the patriotic son of Richard the Lion-Hearted, over John himself, who has all of Macbeth's infirmity of purpose with none of his more Olympian qualities.   The great interest of Robin Phillips's emotionally gripping, if somewhat muddled, production at the Stratford Festival here is that it makes John its unconditional center and, in doing so, presents him as a disturbingly pertinent statesman for our times. \"Macbeth\" and \"Richard III,\" with their portraits of raveningly ambitious, Machiavellian heads of state, were the perfect choices for politically slanted revivals in the paranoiac heyday of the late 60's and early 70's, the years of Johnson and Nixon. \"King John,\" on the other hand, has vital resonance for an age that often sees its politicians less as monsters than mediocrities, distanced from greatness by all-too-pedestrian frailties.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"Another Despotic Creed Seeks to Infiltrate the West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/opinion/IHT-another-despotic-creed-seeks-to-infiltrate-the-west.html","abstract":"Muslim fundamentalism is fast becoming the chief threat to global peace and security as well as a cause of national and local disturbance through terrorism.

The sooner employers learn that the family leave act makes family leave available to both sexes, the closer we'll be to a nondiscriminatory workplace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"For Whom Beryl Toiled : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/opinion/IHT-for-whom-beryl-toiled-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding the editorial \"For Whom Raoul Toiled\" (Aug. 30): .The editorial blithely assumes that Beryl Markham \"probably did not write\" her autobiographical \"West With the Night,\" and suggests that Raoul Schumacher, her thi","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"One Sense of Dogmatic... : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/opinion/IHT-one-sense-of-dogmatic-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Catholicism: The Laity Will Keep Doing It Their Way in Bed\" (Opinion, Aug. 25): .Andrew Greeley denies that \"Catholicism is a list of doctrines and rules that you have to accept.\" Contrary to what Mr. Greeley says, the do","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/nyregion/c-corrections-981093.html","abstract":"  The calendar of events in the Connecticut Weekly on Sunday about a showing of \"The Misfits\" at the Bantam Cinema tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. misstated the admission price.

The 28-year-old Mr. Kravitz is a proud throwback. He reclaims rock from the late 1960's and early 1970's, and he steals only from the best: the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Marvin Gaye. (Meanwhile, the opening act for his tour, Raging Slab, revives the Southern hard-rock of the mid-1970's.) Yet Mr. Kravitz still lives in the music-video era, and for him the golden age of rock means the right props and costumes: old guitars and keyboards, bell-bottomed pants, untamed hairdos and postures of artless sincerity, perhaps learned from repeated viewings of the \"Woodstock\" videotape. \"We're just gonna play,\" he said as one tune stretched out, alluding to a late-1960's Hendrix disclaimer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930909","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/09/nyregion/metro-digest-430393.html","abstract":"  ATTORNEY GENERAL ABRAMS TO RESIGN   The New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams, his hopes of winning a Senate seat dashed last year and his prospects for the governorship apparently stymied, abruptly announced that he would resign the post that he has held for 15 years to become a partner in a Manhattan law firm at the end of the year.

Ms. King, who is playing a rare New York engagement, has always been a compellingly open-hearted performer. With her vigorous pop-gospel piano and Brooklyn-style \"natural woman\" voice, she projects an unimpeachable honesty, earthiness and musical integrity. Expect to hear many of her standards of the 1960's and 70's, along with selections from her recent album, \"Color of Your Dreams,\" in which her singing and songwriting talents seem firmly intact. Shows are at 8 tonight and tomorrow night. Tickets: $35. Laura Nyro Now    Laura Nyro, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Aspects of this introspective singer and songwriter's personality that might have seemed eccentric in the late 1960's and early 70's have coalesced into a lyrical sensibility that could be described as a radical feminist earth mother. Her musical style has changed little over the years. On her new album, \"Walk the Dog and Lite the Lite,\" it is anchored in doo-wop ballads filtered through Philadelphia soul and trimmed with Broadway. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 11. Tickets: $17.50. Bowie From Brazil    Ney Matogrosso and Aquarela Carioca, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 244-3005. Mr. Matogrosso has been called the Brazilian David Bowie for his extravagant self-designed clothing and theatrical concerts. A star since 1973, he sings material by the cream of Brazil's songwriters, among them Caetano Veloso, Milton Nascimento and Jorge Ben. His vocal trademark is his juggling of songs between a punchy tenor and a sweet lyrical alto. Show time is tomorrow night at 8 P.M.; tickets range from $17.50 to $32.50. On Tuesday he begins an engagement through Sept. 26 at the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-3005. 26.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930910","headline":"Beyond the Shock of Recognition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/opinion/beyond-the-shock-of-recognition.html","abstract":"  Yasir Arafat urges Palestinians to reject violence and work for reconstruction, development, cooperation and \"the normalization of life.\" The Palestine Liberation Organization renounces armed struggle and recognizes Israel's right to exist \"in peace and security.\" Israel recognizes the P.L.O. \"as the representative of the Palestinian people.\"   Yes, you're reading these words in the newspaper.

It seemed a reasonable notion, and the idea of hearing concerts on a barge floating in the East River (it is moored under the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge) was quirky enough to make the series popular from the start. But eventually, the arts agencies on which the series depended objected that student performances were too inconsistent to qualify for subsidies, and Mrs. Bloom rethought her approach.   She has not given up on young musicians. Now the concerts she presents on her 94-year-old coffee barge feature ensembles that bring together seasoned performers and talented newcomers. The group that played at Bargemusic on Sunday afternoon included Edward Auer, a pianist well known to New York concertgoers; Christiaan Bor, a Dutch violinist who directs the Amsterdam Kamermuziek Society, and Sung Won Yang, a young cellist whose performance of a Beethoven sonata showed considerable promise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930910","headline":"MIDEAST ACCORD: Refugees; Palestinians' Reactions: Anger, Doubt and Hope","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/world/mideast-accord-refugees-palestinians-reactions-anger-doubt-and-hope.html","abstract":"  Many of the 1.5 million Palestinians who live in the boxy concrete hovels that make up the refugee camps in and around Amman greeted the stunning news of an agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel with a mixture of skepticism, anger and cautious encouragement today.

The jury deadlocked on the amount of money Mr. Masson should receive, and the judge was faced with the question of ordering an entirely new trial or a new trial only on the question of damages.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930910","headline":"1893:1,000 Mile Record : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/opinion/IHT-18931000-mile-record-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - Lawrence Fletcher has accomplished a wonderful ride, beating the 1,000 miles record by over six hours.

There, as the non-Expressionist works at Emmerich suggest, he edged into appropriation in ways that make him seem almost prototypically post-modern, a precursor to Sigmar Polke and other stylistically polymorphous painters of today.   Jorn was active, perhaps overactive, in the postwar European art world.

YITZHAK RABIN   Prime Minister of Israel Arafat to Rabin  Sept. 9, 1993    Mr. Prime Minister,   The signing of the Declaration of Principles marks a new era in the history of the Middle East. In firm conviction thereof, I would like to confirm the following P.L.O. commitments:    The P.L.O. recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.    The P.L.O. accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.   The P.L.O. commits itself to the Middle East peace process and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.    The P.L.O. considers that the signing of the Declaration of Principles constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly, the P.L.O. renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all P.L.O. elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent violations and discipline violators.   In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the P.L.O. affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the P.L.O. undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant.

Stricker, whose starting time was backed up by two rain delays totaling 1 hour 41 minutes, had two holes to go when play was suspended on the Glen Abbey Golf Club course at 7:45 P.M. The 26-year-old Stricker, a native of Edgerton, Wis., who plays most of his golf on the Canadian tour, was eight under for the tournament when play was stopped. Brad Bryant, not yet a winner in his 16-year PGA Tour career, held the clubhouse lead at six-under 138 after a hard-fought 70 in a cold rain. There was plenty of bad weather as winds gusted to 45 miles an hour. In addition to the heavy rains that stopped play twice, intermittent showers fell most of the day and temperatures never got out of the 50's. Brandel Chamblee, Dudley Hart and Phil Blackmar were at 140.    Three Share Lead: Despite bogeys on three of her last five holes, Tina Barrett shared the lead with Michelle Mackall and Brandie Burton at six-under-par 66 after the first round of the Ping-Cellular One Golf Championship in Portland, Ore. Barrett had nine birdies in her round and was eight-under through 13 holes in the $450,000 event. \"It was almost a little bit scary,\" the 26-year-old Barrett said. \"Everything was just going really close to the hole for a while there.

Dr. Elders's message is simple: that Americans must face the daunting facts of adolescent life. Of the 56 million Americans with sexually transmitted diseases, for instance, nearly 17 percent are teen-agers. Teen-agers also account for more than 350,000 abortions every year, and the teen-age birth rate, which dropped steadily through the 70's and early 80's, started rising again in 1986 and is still rising.

With the average tenure of big-city school chiefs now less than three years, the post increasingly appears to be a near-impossible job mired in politics, appealing only to the most dedicated educators.\n\nA large part of the problem is that urban schools, and those who run them, have become society's saviors and scapegoats for the dilemmas facing our cities. Americans increasingly turn to the schools to cope with our most pressing problems, social as well as educational. And when reforms produce controversy and no quick cures for society's ailments, critics vent their anger on the most visible leader.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930911","headline":"COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/11/sports/college-football-report-769493.html","abstract":"  The following is a look at today's top college football games with this season's won-lost record in parentheses and the result of last year's match, current visiting team first, or DNP (did not play).  East    Duke (0-1) vs. Rutgers (1-0) at Giants Stadium. DNP. A defining evening for the Scarlet Knights. Veteran Blue Devil team absorbed a 45-7 loss to Florida State.   Southern California (1-1) at Penn State (1-0) DNP. Trojans trounced Houston after being trounced by North Carolina. Nittany Lions gave up 478 yards passing to Minnesota, a Beaver Stadium record.    Virginia Tech (1-0) at Pittsburgh (1-0) DNP. Big East rivals have never played before. Tech has creditable quarterback in Maurice DeShazo.   Lehigh (0-1) at Fordham (0-0) 16-14. Engineers surrendered 62 points and 609 yards to Delaware. Rams are unknown quantities; likely no world beaters.    Hofstra (1-0) at Rhode Island (0-1) 28-18. Flying Dutchmen continue run-and-shoot attack, good for 337 passing yards against Butler. Rhodies lost opener, 31-10, to Boise State under new coach, Floyd Keith.    Holy Cross (0-0) at Massachusetts (0-0) 3-7. Minutemen's victory last year ended Crusaders' 26-game unbeaten streak at home.    William and Mary (1-0) at Delaware (1-0) DNP. Key match in newly expanded Yankee Conference.    New Hampshire (0-1) at Connecticut (0-1) 21-24. Neither was imposing in opening defeats, Wildcats to William and Mary, 27-14; Huskies to Furman, 26-17. Midwest   Notre Dame (1-0) at Michigan (1-0) 17-17. If underdog Irish can win this one, then Coach Lou Holtz will have several last laughs.    Washington (1-0) at Ohio State (1-0) DNP. Huskies on a mission of redemption. Buckeyes had satisfying 34-7 opening victory over Rice and won't be easy.   Texas A&M (1-0) at Oklahoma (1-0) DNP. First meeting since 1951. Aggies, with mild schedule, will not often be tested like this. Sooners were formidable in 35-3 rout of T.C.U.    Iowa (1-0) at Iowa State (1-0) 21-7. Hawkeyes usually win but maybe not this time. South    Clemson (1-0) at Florida State (2-0) 20-24. Tigers were unimpressive in 10-point triumph over Nevada-Las Vegas. The Seminoles seem awesome.    Georgia (0-1) at Tennessee (1-0) 31-34. Two of nation's best quarterbacks on display. But Vols' Heath Shuler has stronger cast than Bulldogs' Eric Zeier.    Maryland (0-1) at North Carolina (2-0) 24-31. Tar Heels imposing so far. Terps seldom score faster or more often than their foes.    Alabama (1-0) at Vanderbilt (1-0) 25-8. Commodores, who rushed for 431 yards against Wake Forest, may dent the resolute Bama defense. But not enough.    Florida (1-0) at Kentucky (1-0) 35-19. Gators broke in an impressive new quarterback, Terry Dean. They merit everyone's attention.  West    San Diego State (1-0) at California (1-0) DNP. Marshall Faulk may have trouble running through the Golden Bears. Mismatches    Colgate (0-1) at Army (0-0) DNP. Cadets will show a more diversified offense in this rehearsal.    Navy (0-0) at Virginia (1-0) 0-53. The Middies will be stronger this season but won't come close to Cavaliers.    Texas Tech (1-0) at Nebraska (1-0) DNP. Another breeze for Cornhuskers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930911","headline":"Mideast Update","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/11/world/mideast-accord-mideast-update.html","abstract":"  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of ISRAEL signed a letter in JERUSALEM declaring recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

UNIVERSAL COVERAGE   A range of services would be covered, including hospital care, emergency services, doctors and other health professionals, pregnancy-related services, hospice and home health care, ambulances, outpatient laboratory tests and prescription drugs. The Administration describes the coverage as equal to that offered by the nation's largest companies.    A new long-term care program would be created for disabled people that would provide expanded home care services.    Coverage of dental, eye and mental health care would be initially limited, but be expanded in the year 2000. Items considered not medically necessary, like cosmetic surgery, would not be covered.   Free preventive care, including periodic medical exams, immunizations and screening procedures like mammograms, pap smears and readings of cholesterol levels would be provided in accordance with a schedule set by the Government.    A Medicare benefit for prescription drugs would be created. Beneficiaries would pay 25 percent of the program through their Part B premium, a $250 deductible and 20 percent of the costs beyond that to an annual maximum of $1,000.    A choice would be offered between enrollment in a traditional fee-for-service plan, a health maintenance organization or a plan that combines elements of each.   Employers would be allowed to provide benefits that are more generous than the standard package, although after the year 2000 the extra benefits would be treated as taxable income for employees.    Illegal immigrants would not be covered, although they would continue to be eligible for emergency and other services; institutions that serve many uncovered patients would continue to receive Federal reimbursement. HOW IT WOULD WORK    Most Americans would be enrolled in regional entities called health alliances, which would negotiate the price of coverage with health plans, offer a range of plans to members and collect premiums from employers and individuals.    States would insure that alliances exist in areas where coverage would otherwise be insufficient.    Companies with more than 5,000 employees would have the option of providing care to their workers by creating a corporate alliance and contracting directly with a health-care provider.    People now enrolled in Medicare would continue in that program, but could later join the regional alliances. States would have the option of integrating Medicare recipients into their alliances so long as their coverage is as good or better.    Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in regional alliances and receive the standared package of benefits, as well as supplementary services.    All Americans would be issued a national health identification card that would guarantee them access to needed services. WHO WOULD PAY    The average premium for the standard package would be $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families. Businesses would be required to pay 80 percent of the average premium. Families and individuals would pay the difference between that amount and the full cost of the plan they select, meaning that those enrolled in cheaper plans would pay less, or more for plans more expensive than the average. Employers would have the option of paying more than 80 percent. The plan also suggests that a worker would be able to buy an average health policy for just $360 a year and a family policy for $840. The employer would pay four times that much.    No business in a regional alliance would have to pay more than 7.9 percent of its payroll. Companies with fewer than 50 employees and those with many low-wage workers would be eligible for Government subsidies and for caps ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll, depending on their average wages.    Families and individuals could pay their share of the premium directly or through withholding; alliances may require withholding to avoid bad debt.    The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount of the premium, unless they were eligible for assistance based on income.    Retired workers under 65 would be responsible for 20 percent of the premium.    Employers would pay for part-time workers on a pro-rated basis.   Out-of-pocket costs would depend on the kind of service chosen. Alliances would be required to offer high-cost, low-cost and combination plans. The terms appear to refer respectively to traditional fee-for-service coverage, HMO's, and preferred provider networks.    A high-cost plan would allow the use of any doctor but calls for deductibles of $200 an individual and $400 a family and 20 percent co-payment after that.    In a low cost plan, the patient would see only doctors approved by the plan, but pay no deductible besides a $10-a-visit fee for outpatient services.    In the combination plan, the patient would agree to pay 20 percent of the cost whenever using a doctor outside the plan.    Out-of-pocket expenses are capped annually at $1,500 for each person and $3,000 for a family under all three plans. CONTROLLING COSTS    A National Health Board would be created to oversee the system and set a national health budget with the goal of limiting the rate of increase of health care spending to that of the general rate of inflation by 1999. Health care expenses are now growing at more than twice the inflation rate.    If the competitive process does not reduce growth to that level, the board would impose mandatory limits on the growth of annual premiums, forcing health plans to spend less.    Upon introducing the plan, the President would urge all sectors of the health care industry to limit price and spending increases to a specific amount not yet disclosed. Prices and spending would be monitored by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    The National Health Board would make public declarations about the costs of new drugs and could investigate the costs of existing drugs it considers overpriced. It would have no authority to set drug prices.    The rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid would be reduced. WORKERS COMPENSATION    The separate insurance systems that now exist to cover the costs of injuries suffered at work or in automobile accidents would be continued. But the care would be provided through the health alliances created under the plan through contracts between them and the insurers. TAKING EFFECT    States could begin implementing the system by Jan. 1, 1995, and would be required to have it in place by Jan. 1, 1997.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930911","headline":"MIDEAST ACCORD: History; Years of Bloodletting Scar Israeli-P.L.O.
