In  \"Peace and Its Discontents\" he follows his own precept well: few can match the pungency with which he challenges conventional wisdom on the Middle East peace process -- the belief that it is an ineluctably good thing, threatened by self-evidently bad extremists.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Choice of General as Leader Of Drug Fight Is Welcomed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/us/choice-of-general-as-leader-of-drug-fight-is-welcomed.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960128","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/connecticut-guide-002100.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"ART;Japanese Buddhist Artifacts That Convey Profound Serenity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/art-japanese-buddhist-artifacts-that-convey-profound-serenity.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Tension Rises in Korean Stare-Down","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/world/tension-rises-in-korean-stare-down.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Many Exchange a Briefcase For the Sample Case of Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/us/many-exchange-a-briefcase-for-the-sample-case-of-sales.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Cuttings;Keeping the Vegetable Gene Pool Lively and Well","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/cuttings-keeping-the-vegetable-gene-pool-lively-and-well.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"TRAVEL ADVISORY;Scranton Offers Snowplow Train Rides","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/travel/travel-advisory-scranton-offers-snowplow-train-rides.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"ATLANTIC CITY;At the Casinos","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/atlantic-city-at-the-casinos-001953.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"War Crimes Tribunal on Bosnia Is Hampered by Basic Problems","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/world/war-crimes-tribunal-on-bosnia-is-hampered-by-basic-problems.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"For Croton, a Greenway Instead of a Wall of Condos","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/realestate/for-croton-a-greenway-instead-of-a-wall-of-condos.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"January 21-27;A New Diet Strategy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/weekinreview/january-21-27-a-new-diet-strategy.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Week in Review"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"SUPER BOWL XXX Preview;Big Mistakes, But a Grand Career for Lett","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/sports/super-bowl-xxx-preview-big-mistakes-but-a-grand-career-for-lett.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"The View From: Scarsdale;The Way to the Heart Is Sometimes Through the Stomach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/the-view-from-scarsdale-the-way-to-the-heart-is-sometimes-through-the-stomach.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Steelers Preferred, Poll Says","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/sports/steelers-preferred-poll-says.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"WEDDINGS;Barbara King and John T.

The Crime Scene Unit of the Police Department's detective bureau is the largest of its kind in the country, and the busiest. Based in the Bronx, the unit responded to about 3,000  calls for assistance last year, many of them involving murders; a few C.S.U. detectives were even enlisted to help investigate the Oklahoma City bombing. Some of the unit's 78 detectives and supervisors have also been trained as serologists, entomologists, embalmers, architects and engineers -- the better to determine just how a murder was committed and, consequently, who committed it. \n\n     As the sirens and spectators recede, C.S.U. detectives stay behind for as long as 14 hours, logging every piece of potential evidence. This is vital work  even in a case where a suspect is identified at the outset, for a conviction (as all of America now knows) will depend on a sound presentation of the evidence. C.S.U. detectives have carried away items as unwieldy as a chunk of Manhattan asphalt, as minuscule as half a strand of hair, as insubstantial as a tiny puddle of body fluids. A \"deformed\" bullet -- one that has been fired -- is particularly valuable, a fingerprint even more precious. \"Eyewitnesses can forget, confessions can be recanted,\" says Deputy Inspector Phil T. Pulaski, the commanding officer of the forensic investigations division, which includes the C.S.U. \"Fingerprints don't lie.\" It was the print lifted from a can of gasoline  that helped solve the 1993 case in which a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the  cab of a fire truck in Washington Heights, injuring several firemen. In another  case, a fingerprint from a windowpane helped solve the murder of a rabbi's wife  in Brooklyn in 1994.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"BACKTALK;Cowboys Over America","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/sports/backtalkcowboys-over-america.html","abstract":"What are we to make of the Dallas Cowboys? How is it possible that a football team that was so wildly popular to the cutting-edge mentality of the 1970's is even more popular with a where's-mine mentality of the 1990's? If America's Team has undergone some kind of perverted metamorphosis -- transforming from an iron butterfly of the Landry era to the present Tolkienesque worm that ate Pittsburgh -- or is about to, what are we to make of America? \n\n     Like the state that gave them birth, the Cowboys have always been not so much an entity as an attitude. In the 70's they were cool, powerful and standoffish.  They used computers to evaluate talent when most people thought of computers as  a new generation of slide rules. The mystique began with the owner Clint Murchison, who set the style by buying his way into the National Football League and then turning all football decisions over to General Manager Tex Schramm and  Coach Tom Landry.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/books/books-in-brief-fiction-poetry-002569.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"Cheaper by the Dozen: New Cars for Less Than $11,000","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/automobiles/cheaper-by-the-dozen-new-cars-for-less-than-11000.html","abstract":"SMALL cars are bigger and better than ever.

Mr. Mudarov had just turned 102, or so said his passport. A Chechen friend who introduced me whispered in my ear: \"He's cheating. He's actually 106.\" \n\n     Mr. Mudarov, surprisingly erect and lucid, talked about a day in February 1944, when Soviet officers came knocking, Stalin's decree in hand. The entire Chechen nation was to be deported to Central Asia, for collective \"collaboration\" with Nazi Germany. Five of Mr. Mudarov's children, too sick to travel, were executed on the spot. Calmly, he related how one son, bleeding to death, begged for his help. \"I cannot help,\" replied the father, who was wounded but survived, and was then deported himself. His wife and last surviving child vanished in exile.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Week in Review"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"POSTINGS: A Modernist Building to Fit in With the McKim, Mead & White Design for the Campus; For Columbia, a New $68 Million Student Center","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/realestate/postings-modernist-building-fit-with-mckim-mead-white-design-for-campus-for.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"DINING OUT;Many Choices, but With Mixed Results","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/dining-out-many-choices-but-with-mixed-results.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"ART NOTES;Days of Reckoning for 2 Important Artists","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/nyregion/art-notes-days-of-reckoning-for-2-important-artists.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"SUPER BOWL XXX Preview;New Wrinkles in the Old Curtain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/sports/super-bowl-xxx-preview-new-wrinkles-in-the-old-curtain.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"THEATER;Quick: Name a New Musical Star","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/theater/theater-quick-name-a-new-musical-star.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL;Chaney Joins Suspended Star","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/28/sports/college-basketball-chaney-joins-suspended-star.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"ART;How Funny Is the Human Body?

On one side is a band of cybercitizens bent on protecting their privacy as they explore this unmapped territory. On the other are the lawmakers  charged with safeguarding all cybercitizens from crime, even if it means forcing them to give up some of their privacy by, say, signing in as they enter town. \n\n     This is how the public debate over cyberspace security has been framed. And on-line users are, indeed, worried about security. Yankelovich Partners surveyed 400 randomly selected on-line users, aged 16 and older, by telephone in mid-October and found that 90 percent agree that better Internet security is needed to insure that personal and financial information is not accessible to unauthorized people. Nearly 80 percent believe it is too easy for one's credit card number to be stolen if used on the Internet. And almost 70 percent agree that pornography on the Internet has gone far beyond reasonable bounds.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"BACKTALK;Faster, Higher, Farther, More Deeply Tanned?

For those seeking to restore the 103-year-old building, the castle bridges the past and the future, connecting Paterson's glory days as capital of silk manufacturing with the uncertain days to come. \n\n     In refurbishing the deteriorating mansion, Passaic County officials and historians hope to stir interest in the area's history, especially concerning the story of the silk baron Catholina Lambert, who came to America with five British pounds in his pocket and amassed a fortune. The five-month silk strikes  in 1913 that destroyed the man also contributed to the decline of Paterson as an industrial capital.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960128","headline":"ART REVIEW;. . .

Over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests have been carried out since 1945. Nuclear testing is a sensitive political issue. Governments have often performed tests to signal strength. Because of their destruction and fallout, testing has seen opposition by civilians as well as governments, with international bans having been agreed on. Thousands of tests have been performed, with most in the second half of the 20th century."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19960129","time":"1996-01-29
