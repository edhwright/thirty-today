Kelly won in 11.36 seconds, followed by Burkett in 11.40 and Ghana's Philomina Mensha in 11.43. Before the day's action in the meet for athletes 21 and younger, the United States track and field federation told the international federation that the apparent world junior 100-meter record set on May 20 by the American sprinter Tim Montgomery would not be submitted for ratification because the track was too short. The Americans said the time of 9.96 seconds was being withdrawn because the distance Montgomery ran on the Odessa, Tex., track was measured to be four centimeters less than the proper distance. Subject to I.A.A.F. ratification, the current world junior record will now stand at 10.08 seconds, run by Obadele Thompson of Barbados in El Paso on April 16.

Since Key was hardly stunning, the abundance of offense was a wonderful treat. It was the perfect gift.   After Key had wandered through four innings aimlessly, cluttering the bases with Angels each inning and barely avoiding a few disasters, the Yankees provided him with their vision of offensive loveliness in the fifth when they pummeled Chuck Finley for six runs. The inning ended Finley's night and turned Key's into a sweeter experience as he helped the Yankees register a 11-7 victory over California at Anaheim Stadium.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940722","headline":"Health Care Bills Bring Benefits For Some Specific Constituents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/22/us/health-care-debate-special-interests-health-care-bills-bring-benefits-for-some.html","abstract":"  A hospital in Representative Dan Rostenkowski's neighborhood in Chicago is getting Federal aid for a $580 million construction project.

In the upside-down world of alternative rock, however, pretending to hate the business is the best way to get it to come to you. And Catherine certainly has all the ingredients that go into making a good alternative rock band. It may even have too many. It produced its five-song album \"Sleepy\" (TVT) with Billy Corgan, who leads Chicago's biggest current success story, the Smashing Pumpkins. It also shares a bottom-heavy rock esthetic with the Smashing Pumpkins; Mark Rew sings in a raspy, self-mocking growl reminiscent of Kurt Cobain. And as proved by the band's bad jokes on Wednesday, it has trouble communicating directly with its audience, in the manner of Mr. Corgan and Mr. Cobain.   Catherine played few songs with many parts. Songs usually began as slow, winsome rock ballads and after a screeching guitar solo, turned into heavy rockers and finally all-out noise made by three guitars squealing, scraping and clanging in unison. Catherine's music was as ambivalent as the band's relationship to success: it seduced and then repelled.

But it is an incomplete one. Since the early 1980's, the Girl Scouts in Westchester and Putnam Counties have been reaching out to girls from less traditional backgrounds, running troops out of housing for the homeless and residential treatment programs.    While the organization has attempted to retain its traditional goals -- particularly that of instilling self-esteem -- it has also adapted to the times. Some of the old merit badges, like the one for learning to be a hostess, have been retired, supplanted by new patches, like one that certifies an awareness of \"alcohol and chemical dependency.\" Girls, many of whom are left alone for part of the day, are taught personal-safety skills. Leaders work with younger children -- the Daisy and Brownie Scouts, ages 5 to 8 -- on first aid, fire safety and how to make a phone call.

Patrons and Projects, 1892-1912 (Yale University, $60). The author, an assistant curator of European painting at the Art Institute of Chicago, examines Vuillard's work during the two decades in which he created decorative panels and screens for some of his affluent patrons. His first efforts, for a Paris industrialist, established many of the themes Vuillard (1868-1940) would explore in his subsequent decorations: domestic scenes on a terrace, vignettes in a dressmaking studio, images of nursemaids with children in public gardens. Ms. Groom stresses that perhaps more than the choice of subject or format, Vuillard's use of distemper -- a technique requiring the fast and arduous application of a mixture of glue and pigment to obtain a tapestrylike surface -- signaled his concern for the decorative qualities of his work and helped to change ideas about interior decoration and modern esthetics. The book is profusely illustrated with color reproductions not only of Vuillard's work but also of paintings by contemporaries like Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Claude Monet. Sure-footed and fluid, Ms. Groom's highly informative study gives Vuillard's sophisticated decorations the recognition they deserve.

This is an enormous understatement.   Glen Canyon was the largest and most spectacular slickrock canyon system on the Colorado Plateau, a deep, remote, enormous expanse of wilderness. Now under a thousand feet of water and mud in its main channel, it has been reduced to a boat pond and motor resort (treated, as the author pointed out, with contempt by resort owners who have been tossing boat batteries in its waters for years). Many of us who know and love the Colorado Plateau's wilderness feel very bitter about the atrocity known as \"Lake Foul,\" and about the damming of a place whose very wildness and remoteness made it politically defenseless back in the early 60's. To extoll the beauties of the cliffs of Lake Powell without considering what lies underneath the waters, the mud and the engine batteres is akin (using a well-worn analogy) to touring a purposely flooded cathedral and admiring the accessibility of its ceilings.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"The Nueva Basque Cuisine of San Sebastian","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/travel/choice-tables-the-nueva-basque-cuisine-of-san-sebastian.html","abstract":"  SAN Sebastian is a small, elegant seaside resort that feels frozen in time.

It could be in the unfocused, amateurish production itself, which involves 18 actors playing more than 40 roles in almost as many locations as you would find in a three-hour movie. Or it could be in the John Lahr stage adaptation. This updates Richard Condon's grandly skeptical cold war suspense novel from the paranoid, Commie-obsessed 1950's to the late 1990's.    By the year 1999, according to Mr. Lahr, United States military forces will be on permanent peace-keeping patrol in and around the site of the 1991 gulf war. American boys, instead of being shot at by the Chinese Communist-backed North Koreans, as they were in the Korean War in the Condon novel, will be the targets of fanatical \"Shiite guerrillas,\" equipped by heaven knows whom. At the same time, Americans will be so furious about Japanese ownership of American real estate that a demagogic politician could use the issue as successfully as Senator Joseph R. McCarthy used his bogus, anti-Communist witch hunts in the early 1950's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940724","headline":"Journal; Camp Visiting Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/opinion/journal-camp-visiting-day.html","abstract":"  In the letters he has scrawled to me from camp so far, my 10-year-old son, Simon, has reported one ear infection, one long night of watching his counselor involuntarily lose his dinner into a bedside pail, one stomach bug of his own and one incident of being smacked accidentally with a hockey stick.
