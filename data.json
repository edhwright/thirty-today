Development began in 1985 at Carnegie Mellon University under the name ChipTest. It then moved to IBM, where it was first renamed Deep Thought, then again in 1989 to Deep Blue. In 1996, it was used to compete against world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match, where it won one, drew two, and lost three games. In 1997, it underwent an upgrade, and in a six-game rematch it defeated Kasparov by winning two games and drawing three.

Red lights mean stop. Green lights  mean go. But it's more complicated on Washington Street, where traffic lights are few and far between. There are no lights on Washington between Bethune and Christopher Streets, a distance of six blocks. \n\n     Twenty years ago, when the far West Village was still overwhelmingly industrial, the dearth of lights was not a hot issue. But today, the area has evolved into a mixed-use and residential neighborhood with thousands more residents. The growing numbers of popular restaurants are drawing more people and cars to the neighborhood. And more drivers are using Washington Street instead of the often-jammed West Side Highway. Traffic is likely to increase when the highway, known formally as Route 9A, is reconstructed as an urban boulevard starting in the spring.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"CD-ROM's;Good Heavens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/books/cd-rom-s-good-heavens.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"CLASSICAL MUSIC;Finding Maestros for Podium . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/arts/classical-musicfinding-maestros-for-podium.html","abstract":"THE MATING DANCE between an orchestra and a prospective music director can be as circumspect as an old-fashioned courtship or as frank as a modern romance. \n\n     When the St. Louis Symphony began its quest for a successor to Leonard Slatkin two years ago, Bruce Coppock, its executive director, spent months sounding out international artist managers to gauge the interest of particular maestros. \"You could call it a cat-and-mouse game,\" Mr. Coppock said, \"but it's  rooted in the need to protect the privacy and reputations of those involved.\"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/books/books-in-brief-fiction-poetry-035432.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"New Releases","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/arts/new-releases-035297.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"DANCE;Two Rising Stars, On Different Arcs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/arts/dance-two-rising-stars-on-different-arcs.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Multicultural Education: Immersion Lesson for Students","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/multicultural-education-immersion-lesson-for-students.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"SAFE-SEX LIES","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/magazine/l-safe-sex-lies-035670.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE;Haute Kosher: Perfect Business for Gluttons for Punishment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-haute-kosher-perfect-business-for-gluttons.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Magnum Opus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-magnum-opus.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"CHILDREN'S BOOKS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/books/childrens-books.html","abstract":"WHAT JAMIE SAW By Carolyn Coman. 126 pp. Arden, N.C.: Front Street. $13.95.

The white squall of the title -- a rare and dreaded freak of nature -- is brilliantly recreated, a tantrum that we can barely conceive of, an act of wind and water that claims the ship, the captain's wife, another crew member and four students. The storm is so violent and sudden it is deemed a fantasy in the  courtroom scene that ends the film: a courtroom scene in which the captain is charged with failing to adequately command his boat. \n\n     Many sea sagas seem to end in courtrooms, and the reason is clear. Audiences  need a debriefing on dry land after the unimaginable isolation of that different race and government of sailors at sea. And the judges, however sea-wise, always  come to the same conclusion: the prosecutors were not out there. They had days to prepare their case. The mariner had seconds to find a way for himself and his crew to live, out there, as alone in space as Apollo 13, and with no Mission Control.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"THEATER REVIEW;Generic Oppression, Anger and Protest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/theater-review-generic-oppression-anger-and-protest.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Matisse Everywhere","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/nyregion/matisse-everywhere.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"WEDDINGS;Juliet L.

In \"American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword,\" Seymour Martin Lipset motes that while the United States is the most litigious society in the world -- spending four to eight times as much on lawsuits as Germany, England, Italy, France, the Netherlands or Japan -- it is simultaneously one of the most lawless, vexed by crime rates triple those of other industialized nations. Hence America's double-edged sword: on one side of  the blade, \"a high sense of personal responsibility, independent initiative and  voluntarism\"; on the other side, \"self-serving behavior, atomism and a disregard for communal good.\" \n\n      Central to Mr. Lipset's American exceptionalism is the idea of a definable American Creed, \"a set of dogmas about the nature of a good society,\" deriving mostly from the Revolution. These include liberty, egalitarianism (defined as equality of opportunity, not result), individualism, populism and laissez-faire. To buttress his argument, he uses copious survey data to demonstrate how different America is from other advanced countries. For example, in 1992 just 38 percent of Americans agreed that government should reduce the difference in income between rich and poor, compared with 65 percent of Britons, 66 percent of West Germans and 80 percent of Italians.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960211","headline":"Proving to Mr. Dithers That It's Time for a Raise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/11/business/proving-to-mr-dithers-that-its-time-for-a-raise.html","abstract":"CATHY HOOT used to subscribe to the Dagwood Bumstead theory of getting a raise: throw yourself at the boss's mercy.

For years my husband  and I wanted to live in Venice, not just visit -- but the monthlong rentals listed in the brochures we had received from several American real estate brokers were beyond our price range. Luckily we had found several brokers in Venice on previous visits. Their faxed replies to our inquiries were charming, and spoke of slightly cheaper, more intriguing options: \"The apartment is very nice, with furniture in Style. There is also a washdisher.\" \n\n     Though we would fantasize about the charms of these apartments (the dangerous benefit of having no brochure), we hesitated to commit money to a sight-unseen -- even a month is a long time to be stuck with a mistake. Most of the Venetian  brokers gave up after a letter or two, but one -- Chiara Canal, of Gestioni Finanziarie Immobiliari -- kept trying. So on a gray day last spring, when we spied a cheap air fare to Italy, we faxed Chiara one last time.

In his incessant confrontations with racism in the North, he was having doubts about whether he wanted to be an American. He was too contentedly bourgeois, he confesses, to look toward Africa, and besides  did not know his tribe. The more he thought, the less he could deny it: \"I was from somewhere. Mississippi was my heritage and background, and if I wanted to decipher the tangle of contradictions and illusions around me, I was first going to have to learn to decipher myself.\" He adds: \"If I was going to have to live out the fate of being black and American, I felt I needed to know what that meant.
