Mitchell struck out Babe Ruth on four pitches, then Lou Gehrig on three. Mitchell's feat is little remembered; even less remembered is that the remarkable pitcher was a woman. Such a fate has been all too common, Barbara Gregorich observes in WOMEN AT PLAY: The Story of Women in Baseball (Harvest/Harcourt Brace, paper, $14.95). Women have been playing the sport since students at Vassar College formed two teams in 1866. Two decades after professional baseball began in 1869, women formed \"base ball clubs,\" nicknamed the Bloomer Girls. For the next 40 years, these teams barnstormed across the United States, playing men's semiprofessional and minor league teams in exhibition games. The teams were a victim of the Depression, Ms. Gregorich writes, as women were pushed into softball, \"a game significantly less expensive and less difficult to play.\" During World War II, Philip K. Wrigley organized the All-American Girls Baseball League, which inspired the recent movie \"A League of Their Own\"; the league lasted 12 seasons, until 1954. The book concludes with profiles of two women who attempted unsuccessfully to become major league umpires, Bernice Gera and Pam Postema. Ms. Gregorich has written a novel about baseball, \"She's on First,\" but her writing here is frequently wooden. Nevertheless, she is to be commended for bringing out of obscurity such baseball pioneers as Maud Nelson, Lizzie Arlington, Amanda Clement and Alta Weiss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Mother Is Accused Of Scalding Son, 10","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/nyregion/mother-is-accused-of-scalding-son-10.html","abstract":"  A Bronx mother frustrated by her 10-year-old son's performance at school disciplined him by stabbing him in the hand and scalding him with water on the arms and back, the police said yesterday.

But when the last Japanese tenants went back to Japan in July, the house remained vacant until March 1, an ominous sign to Mrs. Buller of the changing Japanese market in the county. \"We see people going back, but we're not seeing their replacements,\" Mrs. Buller said. \"Japanese companies are sending fewer people over, or they are closing offices in the metropolitan area.

A surface fire burns on the forest floor, destroying shrubs and floor litter. A crown fire burns the tops of trees and, fanned by winds, can be much more dangerous and faster moving than a surface fire.     5. False.

Leaves on deciduous trees emit a great deal of water. In winter months in the North or during dry spells in warmer climates, little moisture can be drawn up from frozen or arid ground. So, trees would dry up and die if they retained their leaves.     9. Conifers. The oak is deciduous.    10. All of the answers are correct.    11.

Tree farming; the process of developing and raising trees for their ability to meet various human needs. Forests created by silviculture often feature one type of tree (monoculture), and thus attract a limited variety of wildlife.    13. Tropical rain forests never have a dry season. Most of the trees have broad leaves that are never bare. Because little sunlight filters through the thick treetops, there is relatively little undergrowth on the rainforest floor. By contrast, jungles are characterized by dense, low vegetation and may grow in dry or wet climates.

Spatially warped cross-fading, popularly called \"morphing,\" is a computer-generated special effect that smoothly transforms one image into another. It was used to create stunning effects in films such as \"Terminator 2\" and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\" Now, morphing can be used in class on standard Macintosh computers. (A Windows version is expected in the summer.)   Morph 1.1 shows three windows on the screen. One is the original image -- a student's class photograph that has been digitized with a scanner, for example. Another is the target image, such as a second student's photograph. In the middle is the \"morph\" window. The user matches similar points on the two authentic images, nose and nose, right eye and right eye, and the software calculates the shape and color values in between. A sliding scale allows the user to slowly blend the first image into the second, third and beyond. The resulting \"morph\" images can be saved as a Quicktime movie.

The blooming season, which usually begins the early part of May, can extend into early summer.    Another advantage is that the columbine is not exceptionally fussy about its location. Although the plant will do moderately well in full sun, columbines put their best foot forward when they have some shade during the hottest part of the day.

On April 12 William H. Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, will give a free lecture on Jefferson at the University of Virginia Law School. Events on April 13 include the unveiling of a Jefferson stamp at Monticello and the opening of a major exhibition of the house as it was during Jefferson's time. Birthday events at the University of Virginia include speeches by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the columnist George Will. Events on April 13 are free, except for the special exhibition at Monticello, where visitors must pay the regular admission fee of $8.

(Warner, $9.99.) In this novel, an estranged husband and wife undertake vastly different personal odysseys. Paul Sinclair, a lawyer, leaves Charlottesville, Va., to join an anthropological project in Mexico; his wife, Peggy, does some social experimenting of her own at home. In 1987 our reviewer, Lowry Pei, called the book \"witty\" and \"fast-paced,\" adding that \"the demonic and the domestic inhabit the novel together in a struggle that denies neither and intensifies both.\"     COMING INTO THE END ZONE: A Memoir, by Doris Grumbach. (Norton, $9.95.) The novelist Doris Grumbach began this journal the year she turned 70, expecting to chronicle unsentimentally her own decline. Instead the memoir celebrates her spiritual strength as she travels, buys a house in Maine and continues to record her own vibrant perceptions. \"The immortal and immune part of her has triumphed, and the result is a deeply satisfying book,\" Noel Perrin said here in 1991. Norton has also reissued Ms. Grumbach's 1981 novel, THE MISSING PERSON ($9.95), the story of a Marilyn Monroe-like actress who allows herself to be completely defined by others. Our reviewer, Herbert Gold, described the author as \"ironic and discreet,\" praising the novel's conclusion for \"its special distanced note of grieved attention.\" Also available in a new Norton edition is CHAMBER MUSIC ($9.95), in which Ms. Grumbach used the life of another historic figure, the American composer Edward MacDowell, as the inspiration for fiction. Written as the memoir of a woman whose husband was truly married only to his music, the book provides a \"look into the chamber of one unassuming heart,\" Gail Godwin said here in 1979.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Sanchez And Graf Gain Final","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/sports/tennis-sanchez-and-graf-gain-final.html","abstract":"  First, Gabriela Sabatini, with disbelief in her eyes, but sportsmanship in her manner, walked toward the net to shake the hand of Steffi Graf, the familiar nemesis who had just snubbed her, 6-0, 7-6 (7-3), in the semifinal of the Family Circle Magazine Cup.

The poems that he wrote, set to music and recorded were often banned as \"defeatist\" by the American-supported Governments, but that only enhanced their popularity among those who felt that Mr. Son sang what they could not say. The songs circulated throughout South Vietnam in cassettes, and many a coffee shop was temporarily closed because a policeman happened in before somebody could turn off the stereo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Wendy Friedman, Roy Futterman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/style/engagements-wendy-friedman-roy-futterman.html","abstract":"  Theodore H.

Now they are showing up on the menus of restaurants well outside Cajun country, even a few upscale places that don't pretend to be Cajun.    This is largely because of alligator farming, which has made the meat available all year rather than just during the September hunting season. There are 119 licensed alligator farms in Louisiana, raising some 250,000 or so alligators and yielding half a million pounds of deboned meat annually.

Danner, a criminal justice professor and former probation officer, Honor House operates on the assumption that education, combined with discipline and affection, can transform even the most hardened youths into productive, law-abiding citizens.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"Successful Soldering Requires Practice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/nyregion/home-clinic-successful-soldering-requires-practice.html","abstract":"  Plastic plumbing pipe and high-strength adhesives like epoxy have reduced the need for soldering, but knowing the technique can still be useful. Soldering is the strongest method of joining copper pipe, and it is often the best way to join sheet metal and secure electrical connections.   Soldering requires practice, but successful results are often possible on the first try. In soldering the pieces to be joined are heated until hot enough to melt an additional metallic compound, solder, which, when it flows between them, acts as glue. The process differs from welding, in which the pieces being joined are heated until they melt and flow together.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930404","headline":"The View From: Yale-New Haven Hospital;\nA New Health Center That Treats the Whole Woman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/nyregion/the-view-from-yalenew-haven-hospital-a-new-health-center-that.html","abstract":"WHEN Cathy Zaorski left the Dana Clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital recently, she took home a clean bill of health that ordinarily would have taken many weeks to compile.\n\nMs. Zaorski had spent less than a day as a patient of the Women's Health Initiative, a joint venture of the hospital and Yale School of Medicine that centralizes diagnosis, treatment and prevention of women's health problems.

Standly, who finished 72 holes at seven-under 281, missed a chance to close out his first PGA Tour title when a birdie putt stopped an inch short of the cup on the 18th hole of the 7,116-yard English Turn Golf and Country Club course.

Each shot 69 yesterday to finish at 282. Standly began play two strokes behind 54-hole leader Greg Kraft. Standly had six birdies, five on the front nine despite rain and wind gusting to 25 miles an hour. His only bogey of the day was on the 11th, but he birdied the 12th and then parred in.

This may make Mr. Greidinger, a 29-year-old staff lawyer with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, appear like the hero David defeating the mighty Goliath, but I think his slingshot was misdirected.  The privacy that needs to be protected is not the Social Security number, but the information in the files that the number helps identify.   It would probably be a good idea if Social Security numbers were generally used and available for identification. They are unique, universal, unambiguous and relatively concise. I do not advocate that we give up our names in favor of numbers, but if an organization has to deal with 10 John Smiths, something more is needed. In the past our local police department promoted Project Theftguard, encouraging people to engrave their driver's license number on household articles to assist in their identification in case of theft. I chose to use my Social Security number as being much more practical.   The problem with privacy is not that Social Security numbers are used for identification, but that the custodians of confidential information have inadequate procedures for releasing that information.    If a name is not sufficient to provide access, neither should a Social Security number be. There are other possibile choices. The most obvious is the use of a brief personal identification number, a system used by banks and bank cards.   There will be situations in which it is not practical to set up an identification system in advance, for example, a request for a birth certificate or a request to a credit bureau for one's record in its files. Each organization must be responsible for setting up adequate procedures for safeguarding and releasing its information.    A Social Security number may be helpful for identification, but it need not and should not be the key that unlocks the door to private information.

Frederick Wiseman's remarkable first documentary, an unsparing visit to the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, in Massachusetts, was banned by the state's Supreme Court on the grounds that it violated the privacy of inmates, several of whom were shown naked. The ban was finally overturned in 1991.   Nakedness is an apt symbol for a work that bares the daily assaults of power against the powerless. Little physical brutality is shown at Bridgewater; maybe the staff was on its best behavior. The cruelty takes the form of verbal bullying by guards and the seeming indifference of doctors. Although Mr. Wiseman offers glimpses of affection by the warders for their wards, his camera mainly finds a dim hopelessness that infects everyone consigned to the place, whether as prisoner or caretaker.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930406","headline":"Observer; An Aposiopesis, Eh?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/06/opinion/observer-an-aposiopesis-eh.html","abstract":"  \"We are not amused,\" said Queen Victoria.

After a while, she found three rotting potatoes and an onion, walked home to the Bistrik district in the city center, and cooked her treasures over a wood fire.   As she told her story later, Mrs. Voloder broke down in tears. \"Oh help me, please help me,\" she said over and over as she stood in Sarajevo's central market, clutching a bedroll wrapped in plastic and stamped with the blue-and-yellow flag of the European Community. The bedroll was part of a handout of relief supplies to families in Bistrik, and Mrs. Voloder was hoping somebody would buy it for 10 German marks, about $6.50, so that she could buy more food. Sniper Attack on Rally    On Tuesday, this besieged city will mark the first anniversary of the attack that most people regard as the first volley of the brutal war here, a burst of Serbian sniper fire from a third-floor window of the Holiday Inn that killed several people in a crowd demonstrating outside the Bosnian Parliament for peace and national unity. The shots were aimed at destroying a society, just like the gunfire that cut down Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife on June 28, 1914, about a mile from where the Holiday Inn now stands. Those shots set off the train of events that led to World War I. 'The City Is Destroyed'    But the Sarajevo that emerged from World War I and from World War II, when it was occupied by Nazi forces, suffered only mild physical damage in comparison with the cataclysm wrought by the Serbian siege of the last year. In a city with a population of 380,000, estimates indicate that more than 11,000 Bosnians have been killed and 50,000 have been injured -- making one of every six residents a casualty.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930406","headline":"Finding a Way to Unite 2,280 Wayward Atoms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/06/science/science-watch-finding-a-way-to-unite-2280-wayward-atoms.html","abstract":"  CHEMISTS at the University of Michigan have overcome formidable technical difficulties to create a gigantic ball-shaped molecule that they believe may offer clues to how proteins function in living organisms.

One declarer arrived in the obvious five-diamond contract and played it in the obvious way: Play the top diamonds and if the queen does not fall, try the heart finesse. This plan had good chances, but it failed. An improvement would be to maneuver two spade ruffs in the closed hand, cash three club winners and the diamond ace. Then finesse in trump, for if East began with a doubleton queen he would then endplayed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930406","headline":"Theater in Paris: Elan, Eclat and Assistance","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/06/theater/theater-in-paris-elan-eclat-and-assistance.html","abstract":"  Tonight the seventh annual Moliere awards, the Paris equivalent of the Tonys, will reward this season's theatrical excellence.

Right now, four productions, widely admired and likely to be acclaimed at tonight's ceremony, are playing at four of the city's most important and representative theaters. Among the others are homages to Carlo Goldoni and Alfred de Musset, vehicles for several popular French stars and the second new work of the season from the ever-fecund Peter Brook.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930406","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/06/sports/transactions-533093.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League   BALTIMORE ORIOLES -- Optioned Brad Pennington, pitcher, and John Voigt, outfielder, to Rochester of the International League.

Whether to Lift Immunity    The charges deepened the impression that Italy's postwar political system is rapidly unraveling. Even though the accusations today have yet to be judged in court, they mean that three former Prime Ministers -- Mr. Andreotti, Mr. Forlani and the former Socialist leader Bettino Craxi -- have been implicated, along with hundreds of other politicians and businessmen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930406","headline":"Mayoral Rivals Debate Crime Fears and Statistics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/06/nyregion/mayoral-rivals-debate-crime-fears-and-statistics.html","abstract":"  Mayor David N.
