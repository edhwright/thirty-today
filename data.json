A One-Man Disaster    He's back on stage now, in a new one-man show he's written, \"Time on Fire,\" at Second Stage Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street in Manhattan, which opens tomorrow. The performance is Mr. Handler's tragicomic account of a life-and-death battle that had more significance than a tabloid headline: Mr. Handler's successful struggle with acute myeloid leukemia, an often fatal disease.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930512","headline":"The Unfinished Abortion Battle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/12/opinion/the-unfinished-abortion-battle.html","abstract":"  President Clinton is pro-choice.

Recessions are an aberrant departure from that norm. Correction must come. The question after nearly three years is whether this is so. Or is it possible that the economy has settled into an underemployment equilibrium of small or negligible growth?   There is no great novelty in this suggestion. It happened in the Great Depression: there were 10 years of stagnation that ended not because of any internal dynamic but from the massive spending for the war. And one mildly esoteric branch of economic thought has long allowed for the possibility of an enduring underemployment equilibrium, of stability with high unemployment, of low or negligible economic growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930512","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/12/us/inside-131093.html","abstract":"  Dinkins Unlikely to Delay Vote   Mayor David N.

Searching for a key to unlock this awesome poetic drama, the director finds it in Peer's childhood fantasies, the dreams that he shares with his mother. To a background of trolls and international intrigue, the title character acts out one man's lifelong quest for spiritual self-awareness.   Coming after Mr. Bergman's highly politicized \"Hamlet\" and his revelatory season of Strindberg, Ibsen and O'Neill at the Brooklyn Academy, \"Peer Gynt\" reaffirms his position in the pantheon of experimental theater artists. In his 70's he retains a youthful brashness. His \"Peer Gynt\" is a fabulistic folk tale filled with visual richness and an ebullient sense of comedy. His first production of the play in 1957 was apparently stark and simple.

These fears could well be overblown, but 3.5 million Puerto Ricans are owed a better demonstration that Treasury Department mandarins have responsibly done their homework.    President Clinton has endorsed, and Congress is weighing, a Treasury proposal to amend Section 936 of the tax code that gives U.S. companies an exemption from Federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico. This tax break, which extends to interest on local bank deposits, is seen in Washington as an excessive giveaway whose prudent trimming can yield $7 billion over five years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"One Less Thing to Believe In: Fraud at Fake Cash Machine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/nyregion/one-less-thing-to-believe-in-fraud-at-fake-cash-machine.html","abstract":"  This is a tale of audacity, high-tech thievery and, to no small degree, loss of innocence. For it seems that even the lowly automated teller machine, so common as to be almost invisible in malls and marketplaces everywhere, is not always to be trusted.   For two weeks, an ATM machine -- ordinary-looking in just about every way, but completely bogus -- operated in a shopping mall near here, giving nothing but apologetic receipts that said no transactions were possible. Meanwhile, police investigators and bank officials say, the machine was recording the card numbers and the personal identification numbers that hundreds of customers entered in their vain attempts to make the machine dispense cash. Let the Fraud Begin    Starting late last Friday in Manhattan, while the machine was still running at the Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester, the first withdrawals began. Using counterfeit bank cards encoded with the numbers stolen from Connecticut customers, the thieves strolled through midtown Manhattan, tapping into the 24-hour automated teller network, and netting, by today, at least $50,000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"U.N.

The observers would check all traffic moving across the frontier from Mr. Milosevic's Serbian republic into Bosnia to check on Belgrade's enforcement of its pledge to send only goods such as food and medicine to the Bosnian Serbs and to deny them fuel and military goods. Earlier this week Serbian officials in Belgrade said they would cooperate with such inspections. Latest Security Council Move    The border monitoring plan, which is likely to be approved next week, represents the latest move in the Security Council's tactic of using its economic blockade against the Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro to force President Milosevic to press Bosnia's Serbs into accepting the peace plan.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"Cross-Country Champion Is Reinstated","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-cross-country-champion-is-reinstated.html","abstract":"  The Kenya Amateur Athletics Association lifted its sanctions against JOHN NGUGI, the 1988 Olympic 5,000-meter champion who was suspended Feb. 13 for refusing to a take a drug test.

The attacks on Japanese peacekeepers have shattered the Government's earlier public assurances that there would be no Japanese blood spilled in the first real test of Japan's oft-stated desire to contribute more to the world than just yen.

One of the most sensational versions tasted this year is at Lespinasse, in the St. Regis Hotel, at 2 East 55th Street, (212) 339-6719. The inventive chef, Gray Kunz, who is a master at melding flavors of East and West, has come up with a most unlikely soft-shell crab recipe, one that is as vivid as it is surprising.    He uses medium-size crabs. \"You make sure they are fresh by running your finger across their head to see if they move,\" Mr. Kunz said. He then coats the shell side with a combination of egg yolk, flour and -- \"You won't believe this,\" he says -- Cream of Wheat. Mr. Kunz explains that the cereal adds a crunchy texture and, for some reason, prevents burning when the crabs are cooked in hot oil. The crabs are sauteed, Cream of Wheat side down, until crisp.   \"I then add a little butter to the pan, some shallots, lemon thyme, purple basil and garlic,\" Mr. Kunz said. The flavors permeate the crust wonderfully.   The crab is garnished with fried, pickled ramps (sort of a garlic chive) and frizzled julienne of celery root. This indulgence is not a bargain: $18 as an appetizer, $26 as a main course.

The move comes at a crucial time for the department, as a mayoral commission considers establishing the position of an outside inspector general who would take the ultimate authority over Internal Affairs out of Mr. Kelly's hands.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930514","headline":"Teams' Tempers Flare After the Last Out","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/14/sports/baseball-teams-tempers-flare-after-the-last-out.html","abstract":"  The Yankees and Brewers do not like each other and that was obvious last night when Kevin Reimer's flailing elbow nicked Jim Leyritz in the back on the final out of the game and almost caused the two clubs to square off in a brawl.

Speaking at a luncheon of the city's ministers, Mr. Campbell, with other school officials, defended the district's attempts to improve and said its problems could be solved without the state's moving in.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930514","headline":"On Stage, and Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/14/theater/on-stage-and-off.html","abstract":"  Why Who Got on the Tony List or Not    In the uncharacteristically unrancorous wake of this week's Tony nominations, those with the biggest reasons for grousing (namely the creative team responsible for \"The Goodbye Girl,\" nominated for best musical but not best book or best score) chose to hold their collective tongues. And even Gene Saks, who was dismissed as the show's director out of town in Chicago only to see his replacement, Michael Kidd, receive a nomination this week, was gracious.   \"I don't begrudge him getting the nomination,\" Mr. Saks said. \"I was in the room as a member of the administration committee when the nominations came in, and it seemed to surprise most of the committee, but I don't know whether they were just being nice.

Afflicted with acute myeloid leukemia and told that the chances of reversal were slim, Mr. Handler finds surprising solace in a hospital visit from a rabbi. The rabbi tells him an ancient story. By changing their names, he says, people can make it more difficult for the Angel of Death to find them. Years later, recovered from his illness, Mr. Handler realizes that he has in fact \"fooled the Angel of Death.\" It is a moment of euphoria that is shared by theatergoers at Second Stage, where Mr. Handler is performing his monodrama.   Although he was cured through a bone-marrow transplant, his healing is also one of self-recovery. As he makes clear in this memoir onstage, he has come through with a surer sense of his own identity and a greater feeling of time escaping. From now on, for Mr. Handler time is on fire.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930514","headline":"Review/Film; Father and Son Find Each Other Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/14/movies/review-film-father-and-son-find-each-other-again.html","abstract":"Ex-con and teenage son reunite.
