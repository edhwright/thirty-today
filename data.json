At a time when many rock songwriters (and fans) are gingerly about love, Mr. Buckley's songs plunge into it like a kayak heading for the rapids, riding every surge and whirlpool. Folky guitar licks drift toward hard-rock stomps, which melt away; the words find more longing than bliss.   Mr. Buckley's riveting voice reveals every shade of pain and euphoria, of yearning and shame. He started his set with a display of bravado, volatility and tenderness, singing without words against a hovering guitar chord. A sustained \"oh\" glided into earshot, held steady, quavered with the microtonal turns of Indian raga, moved into a blues curlicue and then changed to a liquid, feminine croon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Essay; The New Disloyalty","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/opinion/essay-the-new-disloyalty.html","abstract":"  Years ago, I brushed my teeth with Kolynos toothpaste.

Through an inspired 20-year collaboration with the pianist and arranger Wally Harper, she has evolved into a cabaret singer of increasing range and depth who spices up a traditional sweetness with her own version of a mature red-hot mama. Although the collaboration has had its stagnant moments, it has just now reached a new peak of creativity and intelligence.   Ms. Cook's new show, which opened a four-week engagement at the Cafe Carlyle on Tuesday evening, finds her exploring her playfully bluesy side with renewed enthusiasm. Without giving up the wistful ballads that remain the cornerstone of her act, the singer has developed a middle and lower vocal range that brings out her sense of humor and shows off her growing rhythmic adventurousness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Image Makers Hard at Work In the Selling of a Candidate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/us/1994-campaign-image-image-makers-hard-work-selling-candidate.html","abstract":"  Nearly 200 miles from the campaign's headquarters in Harrisburg, Pa., but just next door to the recording studio of the pop singer Cyndi Lauper in midtown Manhattan, media consultants gathered to shape the image of Tom Ridge, the Republican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania.

Though short on discernible meaning, these dances were full of tangy atmosphere.    Cliff Keuter, who teaches at the university and was once active in the New York dance scene, contributed three works. \"Studio,\" performed by Gregory Nuber to a Bach score, was a dreaming classroom exercise for a solitary, tight-muscled dancer. \"Starting Over,\" danced by Mr. Nuber and Elizabeth Knock to a taped collage by Mr. Keuter and Brent Davids, was a familiar look at a man and a woman locked in a relationship. \"Ivy\" was a dark blur of a trio, performed by Mr. Nuber, Ms. Knock and Erinn Sullivan to music by Ravel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940926","headline":"Cuomo Plan Would Cut Medicaid to Aid the Uninsured","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/26/nyregion/cuomo-plan-would-cut-medicaid-to-aid-the-uninsured.html","abstract":"  Facing criticism from his Republican challenger for rising welfare spending, Gov.

A profoundly talky crew of academics, they can turn even the simplest exchange into a debate on the relativity of knowledge. The play often feels like a Kantian variation on the old \"Who's on first?\" routine, with Ping-Pong volleys of lines like, \"If I were to say the proof is known, who knows?\"   This annoying tendency is partly a matter of professionally conditioned reflex for Mr. Gilman's characters. But it's also a convenient smoke screen for deceptions ranging from adultery to computer sabotage. Or maybe not. Someone, perhaps everyone, in the play is lying.

History leaves us with Beethoven and filters away Czerny; it elevates Wagner and relegates most of Meyerbeer to a specialty taste.

Is there anybody clamoring for a staged revival of Michael William Balfe's once wildly popular opera, \"The Bohemian Girl\"?   But Leon Botstein, as music director of the American Symphony Orchestra since 1991, has opened a court of appeals. His brand of \"thematic programming\" is often concerned with the fallibility of history's judgment.

Every so often, a maintenance crew cleans and powers up the cranes that used to hoist containers on and off freighters. The multilegged machines are put through a lonely pantomime of the chores that they once did, in the hope that someday New York City will again be a world-class port and they will be needed.

That is probably true. Congress has thereby blocked President Clinton's main legislative initiative and consigned 40 million uninsured Americans to another year of medical roulette.   The defeat ought to trigger an orgy of blame, and there is no shortage of deserving recipients. White House insistence on secret deliberations produced a bill that no one on Capitol Hill was committed to support. A politically inept health adviser, Ira Magaziner, designed a legislative behemoth that scared most members of Congress -- and the public. Hillary Rodham Clinton alienated the pharmaceutical industry and other interest groups that she ultimately needed to push reform through Congress. Demagogic special-interest lobbying and cynical Republican obstructionism designed by Bob Dole in the Senate and Newt Gingrich in the House played a role in the final stall. So did the listless advocacy of Mr. Mitchell and puzzling embrace of defeat by Mr. Clinton and his disorganized White House staff. There will be plenty of time to figure who did the most damage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940927","headline":"Why Health Care Fizzled: Too Little Time and Too Much Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/us/health-care-debate-their-own-words-why-health-care-fizzled-too-little-time-too.html","abstract":"  Everyone in the White House, in Congress and in the lobbyists' offices in Washington now agrees that major health care restructuring is dead for 1994.

Now, in a series of new studies, researchers are finding that insects take their specializations to surprising extremes, becoming highly adapted to eating not just plants of a particular species but specific plants. So fine-tuned are these pests that they can fail to thrive even on plants of the same species growing as little as a few feet away from the one they are adapted to.    The discovery of this evolution of eating preferences has helped explain the long-puzzling observation that some plants can be devastated by voracious insect pests while others of the same species, some close enough to have their branches entwined in their beleaguered neighbors', remain virtually untouched. Researchers say the studies also provide new insights into the evolutionary race between insect pests and the plants they attack, revealing both how quickly insects adapt to their hosts and how variable plants' defenses can be.

Given all the national publicity on the dangers of teen-aged drinking, they had high hopes. They got the school board's mailing list of families with teen-agers. They wrote, reviewed and then rewrote a letter explaining civil liabilities posed by unauthorized beer parties. In early summer, they mailed copies of the letter and permission slips for police entry to about 2,700 homes in this upscale suburb.

You can spot them faster than you can say Quentin Tarantino or even Woody Allen. At the opposite end of the spectrum are the two films in the program called \"Avant-Garde Visions,\" works that revel in their nonnarrative styles and quirky, nontheatrical lengths. Made by masterly film makers -- Alexander Sokurov from Russia and Mani Kaul from India -- they are like elegant visual riffs on literary themes.    \"Whispering Pages\" is Mr. Sokurov's haunting black-and-white meditation on themes from 19th-century Russian literature, most conspicuously \"Crime and Punishment.\" There is a murderer, the Raskolnikov character, who lives in a hovel and wanders the banks of a river. There is a woman, the holy prostitute figure. She becomes the focus of he murderer's philosophical questions about life, guilt and God, phrased in the film's sparse dialogue. Mostly there is extraordinary photography, a palette of dusty gray tones that echo the faded look of 19th-century photographs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940928","headline":"U.S. Plans Vast Restoration for Everglades","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/us/us-plans-vast-restoration-for-everglades.html","abstract":"  The Federal Government has drawn up an ambitious plan to restore the Everglades of southern Florida, reshaping much of the region's 11,000 square miles into something closer to the undisturbed wetlands of a century ago.
