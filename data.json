Twenty years after making an impression in Martin Scorsese's ground-breaking film \"Mean Streets,\" Mr. Keitel, now 54, is once again at the forefront of adventurous cinema. At a time when most of the great actors of his generation -- Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman -- have already had their legend-making roles, Mr. Keitel seems at a new stage in his career.    Last year, two independent films that Mr. Keitel starred in and was the executive producer for -- \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Bad Lieutenant\" -- made him the unchallenged godfather of a new macho ethic. He shows a very different face, however, in \"The Piano,\" the much-acclaimed third feature by the New Zealand director Jane Campion, which opens in New York on Friday. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and closed the New York Film Festival.

Here are some suggestions on forming a patrol, from the Citizens Committee for New York City, which helps neighborhood organizations and publishes a wide range of pamphlets with tips on solving local problems.       TAKE A GOOD LOOK Anti-drug patrols don't work everywhere, especially if drugs are sold behind closed doors or if there is drug-related street violence. A door-to-door survey that asks people about drugs and crime in the neighborhood can provide helpful information and identify people interested in a patrol.  FIND VOLUNTEERS The goal is to bring people to an orientation meeting. Residents who belong to a community organization could offer to form a committee to start a patrol.  Churches, clubs and Parent-Teacher Associations can help. Young people should be included in all phases of planning, decision-making and patrolling. As a security measure, advertise the meeting only by phone calls, word of mouth or announcements at trusted community organizations, and consider meeting outside the neighborhood.  ORIENTATION MEETING Ask a volunteer to keep notes. Discuss the possibility of an anti-drug patrol. A patrol leader from another neighborhood could talk about that neighborhood's experience. Summarize the discussion: the area to be patrolled; policies on street confrontation; cooperation with the police, and security measures. Choose a temporary group of patrol leaders.  SECURITY PLANNING Do not publicize the names of the patrol leaders. Maintain close relations with the police and report any threats immediately. Seek safety in numbers through a large patrol, rallies and community meetings. Patrol members should never confront a drug dealer alone. Information on specific dealers should be relayed to a trusted core-group member, but not talked about at open meetings. (For more information, see the Neighborhood Anti-Crime Center sheet on \"The Potential for Violence in Anti-Drug Organizing.\")  POLICE RELATIONS Get in touch with the community affairs officer or unit assigned to work with the community.  TRAIN AND PREPARE Ask the police for training in recognizing drug-dealing situations and signs of crimes in progress, reporting information in a form useful to the police, making accurate descriptions of suspected dealers, calling for help in an emergency and safety on the street.   Among useful materials are handheld two-way radio sets (FM sets have a wider range than those operating on citizens'-band frequencies); printed forms for recording incidents and logging each patrol; notebooks; clipboards; flashlights; whistles and jackets, T-shirts, armbands or other form of identification.   Set up procedures for joining the patrol: for example, being trained in the principles and procedures of the patrol.   BEGIN PATROLLING The kind of patrol will vary with the size and strengths of your group, the kind of drug problem you face and the neighborhood terrain.    A few rules that apply to all patrols:   Plan a regular schedule (based on the days and times when a patrol is most needed and volunteers are available) and a standard route. After a while, try different routes or different times to keep the dealers off balance.   Notify the police each time you go out and return.   Maintain contact via walkie-talkie with a home base, an office or building lobby, perhaps. Home base requires a telephone to call the police.   Go out in a group and appoint a captain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"From Sidelines 'Sis Boom Bah' To Making Tackles on the Field","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/nyregion/from-sidelines-sis-boom-bah-to-making-tackles-on-the-field.html","abstract":"  BRUSHING past two blockers, the defensive right end cut left, lunged and tackled the ball carrier just across the line of scrimmage. \"Tackle by No. 80, Tiffany Sacchi,\" the public address announcer told a crowd of about 200 at Mount Nebo Park on a recent Friday night during a game between the Patriots and the Raiders in the Manchester Midget Football League.

Children using his \"Success for All\" program are reading a grade level ahead of inner-city children who do not use it.    This is not some academic abstraction.

You can walk into Dr. Bernard Harris Elementary in Baltimore, an all-black inner-city public school where 87 percent of thie children get free lunches, and shake the hands of the fifth graders Demetria Boyd, Keith Dickerson and Jamal McNeil, each one a whiz-bang reader. Demetria, Keith and Jamal all read below grade level as first graders and needed the Johns Hopkins program's daily one-on-one tutoring.

Work crews at Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, Brooklyn, have discovered that the school's exterior masonry is so eroded after years of neglect that its terra cotta facade is peeling away from the sprawling four-story structure. Contractors were recently forced to take emergency measures to keep its Gothic towers from crashing down onto Flatbush Avenue, and workers have begun dismantling the towers brick by brick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"BEST SELLERS: November 7, 1993","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/books/best-sellers-november-7-1993.html","abstract":"                   Weeks    This   Last   On    Week   Week   List   Fiction              1   1   65   THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, by Robert James Waller.

Both Mayor David Dinkins and Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani agreed to participate in the system, which provides public matching funds to municipal candidates who agree to extensive financial disclosure, limits on private contributions and an overall limit on campaign spending.

Going into the second half, Passaic coach Ray McCrann had reason to be concerned. His Indians, generally regarded as one of New Jersey's top 10 teams, trailed its Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League rival by 7-0 and was in enemy territory once.   \"The first half was stinko, but the second half was super,\" McCrann said.   Fortunately for McCrann and company, Poteete got Passaic going on the second half's first play, returning the kickoff 90 yards for the tying touchdown.    On Passaic's next possession, it marched 72 yards on 12 plays and took the lead when Poteete ran in from 3 yards out.   Kennedy didn't go down easily though. Halfway through the fourth period, Kennedy drove 64 yards on 9 plays and tied the score when fullback Marion Smallwood ran in from 3 yards out.   It only took Passaic two plays from scrimmage to take the lead back. On a second-and-10, Poteete took the ball off tackle and raced 64 yards for the winning score.   Also helping the Indians was fullback Raymond Santos, who rushed for 94 yards and kicked two extra points.

Against one wall, a life-size alcoholic with a bottle in his hand comforts a young prostitute carrying a toy bunny. Nearby, a homeless man's frightened eyes peek out from a cardboard-box shelter. A Rodin-like figure in cape and hat huddles against the cold, while across the room, a fierce-looking man sticks out his tongue at the passing world.   This is not a museum storeroom but a space in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Veterans Affairs Hospital, a mainly psychiatric institution spreading over 220 acres near the Hudson River here. How the sculptures got here is the story of one World War II veteran who found solace at the hospital after decades of mental torment. He died in August at age 67, but his artistry lives on, not only in his figures of the homeless -- awaiting a benefactor with the money to have them bronzed -- but also in the sculpture garden he created at the hospital while he was an inpatient.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"The First Antecedent","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/movies/l-20-bucks-the-first-antecedent-311293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a film scholar, I am moved to comment on Lauren David Peden's article, \" '20 Bucks,' a Film 58 Years Aborning\"  [ Oct. 17 ] .

First announced for 28 cities by Hertz, the biggest company, at the beginning of October, the increases are in effect by now in 100 cities, and other companies are following suit.    The reason cited by the companies was an increase in the cost of the autos they buy. David Sparks, vice president for marketing and sales for Budget Rent A Car, said that the expense of buying cars represented 55 to 60 percent of a rental company's costs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Token Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/style/token-art.html","abstract":"SURROUNDED by the bleeps and blasts of his childhood, Mark Oliver strolled down memory lane.\n\n\"I went through phases on all these machines,\" the astonished Mr. Oliver, a 26-year-old Floridian, said last month while he and members of his family, whom he was visiting in New York, surveyed an exhibition of video games sure to give nostalgia buffs a nasty case of Pac-Man fever. \"I had forgotten that some of these existed.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Television As Teacher's Assistant","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/education/blackboard-television-as-teacher-s-assistant.html","abstract":"  JUDY Tretiak, a kindergarten teacher in Westfield, N.J., was having trouble explaining volcanoes to her students.

M. W. Turner is perhaps best known for his alchemical fusings of fire and water, sky and sea, in spectacular atmospheric images in which solid forms, be they ships or castles, seem nearly to dissolve in light and color. To different critics at different times, his monumental canvases have prefigured a range of later styles, from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism. But it is not the more familiar, grand pictures -- of Parliament on fire or Trafalgar battleships -- that are the main subject of this small and charming book, TURNER ON THE THAMES: River Journeys in the Year 1805 (Yale University, $45). Instead, David Hill, an art historian at the University of Leeds, takes the reader on an intimate excursion into a small domain within Turner's work -- the many beautiful, serene sketches he made of the Thames in his first years at Syon Ferry House, which had a view of the river. During that time, Turner escaped from the entangled politics of London's art world, where the Royal Academy was marooned in petty disputes, to paint alfresco on the riverbanks. From his boat, he made oil paintings as well as watercolors; his lustrous oils are delightfully sensuous, with brush marks in thin paint following the grain of the mahogany boards. With an imagination primed with verses by Virgil and Dante (Turner had also been trying to write poetry), the painter transformed many of England's plain and rustic spots into classic idylls, as in \"Isis\" (1806). Painted at Weymouth, the canvas depicts an elegiac vista of arching trees silhouetted against a golden Italianate sky, with a silvery thread of water winding past. But the reader is not forever lost in Turner's ennobling vision; Mr. Hill's animated and meticulous descriptions of Turner's working methods, often including a contemporary photo of the landscape pictured, provide the perfect counterpoint to the artist's dreamy impressions of a great river on its seaward journey.\nSIRI HUNTOON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Skiers' Strolling Fingers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/travel/travel-advisory-book-skiers-strolling-fingers.html","abstract":"  Looking for a masseuse in Killington or a snowboard shop in Whistler, British Columbia?

Emma Thompson is the housekeeper. They have worked together and lived under the same roof for years. He is truly, madly, deeply in love with her, and she with him. But he has never told her. They have never exchanged more than the most proper pleasantries.

His only response is to inform her of some dusting that needs to be done upstairs and to bid her goodnight.   What kind of man is this? Repressed. Incapable of acting on his feelings. Paralyzed by an impacted libido. Frozen. More importantly, what kind of movie hero is this? All too typical, it seems. Typical not just of the leading men in tony period pieces like \"The Remains of the Day\" or \"The Age of Innocence,\" in which Newland Archer (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) lets the love of his life pass him by.

I speak with some authority, since at various times in my traveling career I have suffered from both versions, to the point where, at worst, I've cut trips short and hightailed it home, and where, at best, this oddly nostalgic, bittersweet longing for things familiar has furrowed even the happiest of my travels with some deep sloughs of despond.   \"Homesickness?\" people are apt to say incredulously when the subject comes up. \"Sick of home is more like it for me.\" And indeed, for many, longing for home is the very last thing on their minds when they are off traveling. But there are others for whom homesickness is a crippling problem, the equal of seasickness, fear of flying, culture shock or any of those other maladies of the traveling life. I suspect if you were to examine the hesitations of that larger-than-you-might-think population who, having the time, money and health to travel, never venture more than a few miles from home, homesickness would be at the root of their timidity. A stint in the army where all you wanted was to get home once again, a spell working in a strange city where no one knew you and no friends were made -- these are the experiences people flee from, so terrifying that the condition of awayness is never risked again.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931107","headline":"Deborah Novick, Todd Goldberg","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/07/style/weddings-deborah-novick-todd-goldberg.html","abstract":"  Deborah Ruth Novick, the daughter of Susan and Jeffrey Novick of Syosset, L.I., was married last evening to Todd Alan Goldberg, a son of Phyllis and Marshall Goldberg of West Orange, N.J.

The train from London usually takes about two hours, with a change along the way to a humbler branch line, usually at Newark.

What he fails to realize is that it was corporate executives -- not the mass audience -- who slashed the budgets of the news divisions at the networks and drastically reduced their ability to cover foreign news.   In the last five years, for example, NBC has closed bureaus in Paris, Rome, Amman, Cairo, Frankfurt and Johannesburg. And when was the last time Mr. Goodman saw a story from Asia on any network? Similar cuts in domestic coverage have prevented a thinned line of correspondents and producers from spending more time on in-depth reportage.   Were corporate executives looking at the bottom line or at ratings books and audience surveys when foreign and domestic staffing was reduced?

Harper Perennial, $12. The lives of this novel's characters revolve around Bridgeport, Conn., a city fading to grim shabbiness. Beginning with a murder in the 1940's, the book follows the fates of diverse individuals who are somehow touched by this crime. Last year our reviewer, John Casey, called it a synergy of the author's \"meditative social vision and storytelling immediacy, of her highly developed technical skill and of her alert heart.\"  JFK: Reckless Youth By Nigel Hamilton. Random House, $15. The first of a projected three-volume biography, this book covers the years from John F. Kennedy's birth, in 1917, to 1946, when he was first elected to office as a Massachusetts Congressman. \"By the very detail and depth of the revelations, the flashes of brilliance and consistency of insight, 'JFK: Reckless Youth' easily takes its place beside the best of recent Presidential portraits,\" Roger Morris said here last year. Random House has also reissued EYEBALL TO EYEBALL: The Inside Story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, by Dino A. Brugioni ($16), the supervisor of aerial reconnaissance photographs at the time. He demonstrates how important the new surveillance technology was to the denouement of the watershed foreign-policy event of the Kennedy Presidency. Last year our reviewer, Graham T.

Jacques Toubon, who got Mr. Lang's job as Minister of Culture after the Gaullist sweep in the March elections, is a balding, round-faced, 52-year-old croupier's son from Nice. His main political accomplishment heretofore was his terrierlike loyalty to Jacques Chirac, the Mayor of Paris, the former Prime Minister and, both men hope, the future President.   Still, despite the unstoppable momentum of many of the Socialist initiatives, particularly the major Paris building projects known as the Grands Travaux, Mr. Toubon is trying hard to make his mark after seven months on the job. He has had his identity problems, especially outside the French press: he was recently referred to as Troubon and Tourbon in two English-language newspapers. But partly through the sheer visibility and patronage his job entails and partly through the attention inevitably paid him during the current debate on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, he seems to be establishing himself. Patience Needed    Bustling into his Palais Royal offices for a breakfast meeting recently, Mr. Toubon does not yet inhabit these gilded and mirrored quarters with the seigneurial panache of his predecessor. He argues that there is more that is similar than dissimilar between the cultural policies of the left and the right. And that any striking shifts in French cultural policy will become evident only a few years hence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931108","headline":"3 Players Seek a Director For Foreign Policy Story","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/08/world/3-players-seek-a-director-for-foreign-policy-story.html","abstract":"  They are three troubled men in search of a strategy: a cerebral former college professor, a gregarious former Congressman and a careful lawyer cast in the roles of the United States' top national security advisers.

Concertgoers old enough to remember the recitals and theater productions that had made Hunter a lively place between 1942 and 1975 could not help glancing wistfully around the tattered auditorium, or walking through the college's main building to peek into the larger Assembly Hall, where Horowitz, Heifetz, Segovia, Rubinstein, Pinza and other classical-music greats used to perform.   But after letting its performance series slide for nearly 20 years, to become a casualty of changing policies and campus overcrowding, Hunter is getting back into the business with a vengeance. The Playhouse, at 68th Street at Lexington Avenue, has been fully revamped, and Joseph A. LoSchiavo, its new administrator, has put together a schedule of 200 dance, music and theater performances. The hall opened for business quietly in April. But its official Inaugural Week begins tonight with a Lerner and Loewe revue, \"The Night They Invented Champagne.\" Stiff Competition    Hunter's new program is likely to draw heavily on an audience already stretched thin by the recession and distracted by numerous other entertainment choices. On the East Side alone, the Playhouse is up against competition from the Tisch Center at the 92d Street Y, the Metropolitan Museum, the Frick Collection and Gould Hall. Across town, Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Merkin Concert Hall, Town Hall, the Joyce Theater and other halls offer further diversions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931108","headline":"Deborah Cummis, Richard E.
