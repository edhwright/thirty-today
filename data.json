Having heard that exercise can help maintain and even increase bone mass, they are walking, running, swimming, cycling and even lifting weights to ward off the fractures caused by osteoporosis.    But many exercise enthusiasts are not getting the benefits they think they are, recent studies indicate. First, not all kinds of exercise are equally beneficial to bone strength and some types may do little good. And second, exercise is but one of three crucial factors in maintaining healthy bones. The other two, an adequate intake of calcium throughout life and, for women at or past menopause, estrogen replacement therapy, complement the effects of exercise and may even be essential to its potential bone-building benefits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930714","headline":"Judge Allows Stricter Rules on Emissions for New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/14/nyregion/judge-allows-stricter-rules-on-emissions-for-new-york.html","abstract":"  A Federal judge said yesterday that he was wrong in January when he barred New York State from adopting California's strict rules on air pollution from cars -- rules aimed at eliminating the kind of smog that blanketed the region last week.

He used a third of his three-hour show to perform his latest album-length musical theater work, \"Psychoderelict\" (Atlantic). But with an electric guitar in hand, the 48-year-old songwriter was still a rocker, singing with fervor, duckwalking and jumping around and, at one point, accidentally careening into a speaker cabinet as he bounded across the stage. The first hard-rock pioneer to win a Tony Award has not succumbed to middle-aged decorum.   The concert, part of Mr. Townshend's first American tour leading a band that's not the Who, balanced crowdpleasers and obscurities. He drew on his solo albums and on \"Rough Mix,\" a 1977 collaboration with Ronnie Lane. But he didn't hesitate to sing material he wrote that was originally belted by Roger Daltrey with the Who.

Against a veneer of frivolous dalliance, he was debunking posturing patriotism and the glorification of war and, of course, commenting on class differences, while mocking the shameless romanticism and idealism that suited his story.

But as it bizarrely happened, just such a tremor shook the West End on Monday. Hours before the opening of Mr. Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard,\" the newspapers gave big play to the unexpected announcement that the West End production of the Broadway hit \"City of Angels\" would close after only a four-month run.    \"City of Angels\" received rave reviews, and its box-office collapse was blamed on the gravity of the recession and the declining sophistication of West End audiences. Since both \"Angels\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" happen to be about Hollywood in the late 1940's, the abrupt failure of the American show cast a particular pall over Mr. Lloyd Webber's gala premiere. Although \"Sunset\" boasts the cushion of a large advance sale -- at $:4 million ($6 million), neck and neck with a new revival of \"Grease,\" starring Debbie Gibson -- any visitor to its box office last week could discover that seats are readily available, as they are for virtually every West End attraction.

The entrance set the tone for a show in which Ms. Turner, who is 54, maintained a studied distance from her raunchier image of earlier days.

All's fair in fiction, of course, and what Ms. Grimes has done, apparently, is use her book to air her own grievances, in the tradition of 18th-century satirists who changed their enemies' names and then skewered them in print or, more recently, of Nora Ephron, whose book \"Heartburn\" was one big howl of fictional rage against her ex-husband, Carl Bernstein.

Tomoko Liguori Gallery  93 Grand Street  SoHo  Through July 24    An ominous tone runs through much of the work in this group show, which focuses on the relationship between personal identity and the body.  In Bill Jacobson's out-of-focus black-and-white images, a man's head becomes featureless and generic; in Joe Ziolkowski's studio pictures, crisply lighted and sharply focused, nude males balance precariously on a tightrope or hang upside down.   The fleshly theme is continued in Cindy Sherman's dress-up picture of herself as pregnant (with a plastic belly) and wearing white eye shadow and wild hair; one of John Coplans's nude self-portraits, as a heroic if hairy figure, is included as well. The dissolution of the body is suggested by Ilyse Soutine's flatfooted color photograph of what looks like a homemade electric chair, and by Jeff Wall's coolly dispassionate aerial view of a cemetery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Croatia and Bosnia : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/opinion/IHT-croatia-and-bosnia-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The international community has a growing tendency to cover up its indecision over Bosnia-Herzegovina by putting the blame not just on the Serbs but on the Croatian side, too. .On the one hand, the international community presses the Croats to negotiat","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930716","headline":"Indurain Is Fast; Rominger Is First","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/16/sports/cycling-indurain-is-fast-rominger-is-first.html","abstract":"  Luck, or whatever it was that he did not have earlier in the Tour de France, has begun to turn Tony Rominger's way, and today the Swiss rider won his second successive Alpine stage.

They must honestly and openly examine all causes of priestly abuse and the historical pattern of institutional cover-up. An examination of causes would demand serious answers to questions concerning the spiritual and psychological training of Catholic priests.

Among his generation of thirty-something solo performance artists, Mr. Cale, a Briton transplanted to New York City, has the tenderest, most poetic sensibility. At once surreal, romantic and funny, his best solo monologues explore relationships and varieties of sexuality with a finely-tuned ear to the nuances of erotic dialogue and a penetrating psychological awareness. The Nuyorican Poets are literary rappers whose style falls somewhere between Gil Scott-Heron and L. L. Cool J. Showtime is tonight at 8:30 and admission is free.  Fusing Two Talents    K. T.

Wittily phrased renditions of such comic delicacies as \"Rhode Island Is Famous for You\" blend beautifully with ballads like \"Something to Remember You By.\" The Dietz-Schwartz tribute plays at 9:30 tonight and tomorrow night. In her other show, \"For the Record,\" at 11:30 P.M. both nights, she sings selections from her new album, \"Crazy World\" (DRG).

This drag performer, who appears in several amusing get-ups, welcomes assorted guests, including Julie Halston. The musical fare ranges from \"Town Without Pity\" done as a campy hoods-and-bad-girl production number, to Kurt Weill's and Langston Hughes's \"Lonely House,\" done straight.

Obviously determined to be more authentic and less gooey than the 1937 black-and-white film adaptation, which starred Shirley Temple, this \"Heidi\" seeks to explore the characters in depth. It does, but three hours might have done the trick just as well.    Even before the opening credits, we see Grandfather (Jason Robards) feuding with his only son, who then stalks off with his wife and infant daughter, Heidi. The old man watches in horror as a tree struck by lightning falls on the young family. Only the baby survives. Grandfather retreats to his cabin. People will later claim that he has not been \"right in the head\" since his son's death.

If it were by Michelangelo, there would no doubt be lines stretching all the way from the museum's lobby to the Lehman wing, where \"Christ and St. Thomas\" is on view. But Verrocchio's reputation was long ago wounded by, who else, a critic: Giorgio Vasari, writing in 1550, almost three-quarters of a century after the unveiling of \"Christ and St. Thomas,\" described Verrocchio's art as \"hard and crude, since it was the product of unremitting study rather than of any natural gift or facility.\" Vasari's opinion has echoed through time so that now Verrocchio may be better known as the teacher of his studio assistant, Leonardo da Vinci, than for his own prodigious achievements.

Its Art Moderne design, by Raymond Irrera and Ben Schlanger, incorporated such innovations as indirect lighting and a sloping floor.
