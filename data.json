In an era when farming is a shrinking industry, the Australian recession has hit the rural sector particularly hard. Vast properties that supported dozens of people a few decades ago now often cannot support one family. Farmers have been forced to become creative and versatile. For many this involves scaling back traditional pursuits, such as wool production, and exploring new markets such as tourism. Working farms, known as stations or properties, that accept guests are now a common feature in every state; there are over 1,000 throughout Australia. I recently stayed at two such properties, Millamolong and Belltrees, in New South Wales, both within easy reach of Sydney.\n Millamolong\n\nThis 10,000-acre property is four hours by road west of Sydney. The surrounding area was the site of Australia's first gold rush in the 1850's, and now the rolling hills are known for producing lamb, wool and beef. Millamolong has some 2,500 cattle, 12,000 sheep and 200 horses, managed by a head stockman and five farmhands.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"A Theme Park Of Itself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/arts/l-times-square-a-theme-park-of-itself-610593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Jean Baudrillard, it seems, is finally right: we live in a culture of the simulacrum.

Whatever the reason, early on in my weeklong cruise of the western Caribbean in July, I decided that a floating vacation, of which this was my first, was a perfect way to put aside, however briefly, the tensions of work and city life -- to unwind, and to enjoy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"On Bourbon, Near Fifth","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/style/on-bourbon-near-fifth.html","abstract":"  Central Park Conservancy's 'Night in New Orleans' jazzed up the park, Sept. 30.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"Indomitable Agnes de Mille","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/opinion/indomitable-agnes-de-mille.html","abstract":"  Several years after a devastating cerebral hemorrhage in 1975, the choreographer Agnes de Mille supervised a new production of her famous \"Rodeo.\" Just before Miss de Mille, who died last week at 88, arrived in a wheelchair pushed by an attendant to view a rehearsal, her assistant said, \"She won't like it.\"   He was right. \"She recast it,\" recalls a young dancer who appeared in the ballet. \"And I remember how she had us, droves of us, running across the stage again and again until we got it right.

In 1989, when the New York-based organization devoted to supporting composers and expanding the audience for new music began giving money to jazz composers, it was a fairly radical thing to do. And the definition of jazz implicit in the grants, like that in much of the jazz community, has been resolutely open-minded; almost any form of improvisation, according to that interpretation, constitutes jazz.   It's a perspective good enough for a living-room discussion, but when it manifests itself in policy it can become problematic, as this year's grants demonstrate. The Pacific Rim Players, an unrecorded big band from Oregon, received $30,000 and is commissioning Wayne Horvitz, Robin Holcomb and Bob Nell to write pieces for it. The San Francisco-based Rova Saxophone Quartet will get $24,000 and has commissioned works from Muhal Richard Abrams, Steve Adams (a member of the quartet) and Fred Frith.

It is a more urban place than it once was, denser and tenser and busier than ever. Its citizens are less inclined to fool themselves into believing that escape brings freedom from the woes that afflict other cities, less willing to pretend that Los Angeles is as different from other cities as they once thought.   It's against this background of growing urban consciousness that the city's decision to spend $214 million on a library in the middle of its downtown has to be viewed. This library is not only a place of books but a statement about urbanism, a statement about Los Angeles's increasing willingness to let itself be like other, older cities. Designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a New York and Los Angeles firm with what could be called a highly urban sensibility, the project almost didn't happen at all. That it not only got built but turned out as well as it did is a triumphant moment for both the city's architecture and its history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"The Great Anger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/books/the-great-anger.html","abstract":"A MASS FOR ARRAS\nBy Andrzej Szczypiorski.\nTranslated by Richard Lourie.\n188 pp. New York:\nGrove Press. $18.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"On Sunday; As Pizza Maker Knows, Sinatra Still Delivers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/nyregion/on-sunday-as-pizza-maker-knows-sinatra-still-delivers.html","abstract":"  THERE is a generation whose Elvis never died. \"Shooby-dooby-doo,\" some of its odder members still mumble lyrically at times, a tribute to the closing wisp of Frank Sinatra's \"Strangers in the Night.\" The more imaginative rent the video of \"The Pope of Greenwich Village\" solely to watch the opening credits and hear \"Summer Wind\" sung so cleanly by Sinatra as the actor Mickey Rourke dolls himself up in quintessential New York double-breasted sharpness, French cuffs and all, a perfect visual for Sinatra's articulation.

Officials suggested that this \"difference\" is due to the large number of women exposed to crime while working late at night. The clear message is that women are at greater risk of being murdered in the workplace than men.   A critical reading of other statistics in the article discloses an entirely different picture. Men account for 93 percent of all job-related deaths, although only 55 percent of the work force is male.   What this means is that less than 3 percent (40 percent of 7 percent) of workplace deaths are female murders, while almost 14 percent (15 percent of 93 percent) are male murders. If we then take account of the differential representation of the sexes in the work force, we can see that a man is almost four times as likely to be murdered in the workplace as a woman and that a man is more than 11 times as likely as a woman to be killed on the job by all causes combined.   Thus, the reason that a greater proportion of female deaths in the workplace are murders is not that women are murdered at a higher rate than men, because they are not. It is rather that men are killed at a higher rate by other causes.   The slant of this report is symptomatic of the treatment of virtually any statistics that show differences between men and women. It is almost as if a conscious decision had been made along the line to report the information in a way to reinforce the notion that women are being victimized. KINGSLEY R.

At the onset of World War I, Italy had enjoyed less than half a century of unified statehood. Its artistic aspirations were suspended between the Fascist desire for an undiluted Italy and the belle epoque's romance with nature, between a mimicry of other European styles and the reincorporation of Italy's own classical legacy, between a giddy quest for an avant-garde and a vernacular means to persuade a population, 30 percent of which was illiterate, to feel optimism amid an economic crisis. As Mr. Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Ms. Fili, a New York designer, show, the resultant style incorporated a humanizing of technology, a mythic treatment of contemporary imagery, and airbrushed shapes that suggested an egoless production. While the Futurists' work by self-definition was a reckless, audacious movement -- for industry it proved frivolous, for advertising almost useless -- the resulting graphic work extracted the workable, pragmatic aspects otherwise buried in the rarefied bombast of art manifestoes. \"Italian Art Deco\" displays the objects of Italy's longed-for arte-vita, the availability of art in everyday life. Fifty years later, the Art Moderne designers' dreams of a future with radio, air travel and robots has been fulfilled, and still their designs possess the radiance of a charmed modernity.\nMICHAEL J.

Q.  What inspired this book?   A.  That kind of question is so hard to answer.   Q.  O.K. Was there a reason you were thinking about issues like a breakdown in civility in middle-class America?   A.  The ideas and the issues raised in the book are probably related to things I think about, but they are also just in the air.   Q.  Like what things?   A.  Well, pick an example. Schools are closing down. I remember when I decided that the schools in the book have actually closed down because of a taxpayer vote. That day, I picked up the paper and the taxpayers in some California county had closed down the schools. I've also been in plenty of towns in suburban neighborhoods that have been heavily fortified. People build walls and have video cameras and guard stations.   Q.  Tell me about your style.   A.  I decided that I would write it without any space breaks or chapters, and that was just a technical decision. It was formal. I thought of it as a challenge.   Q.  When you write something as dark as this book -- for instance, a young girl is murdered while Pete looks on -- does it concern you that readers might wonder what kind of guy would even think of these things?   A.  Sure, but that's the book I wrote. It's a work of fiction. I don't walk around worrying about it, but it's crossed my mind and there were times before the book came out where I became very uncomfortable and fidgety. But it is also liberating to write a character who is not necessarily redeemed. That's a great freedom, but yeah, there is something uncomfortable in the overlap between author and book. This is a long way of saying, \"Yes and no.\"   Q.  Do you answer \"yes and no\" to a lot of questions?   A.  Sure, because a lot of questions are complex.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"JoAnne Cahill and A. B.

On to the Main Event.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/nyregion/good-eating-ok-jurors-recess-on-to-the-main-event.html","abstract":"  The City asked Eric Asimov, who writes the $25 and Under column for The Times, to visit restaurants near the city's courthouses. Here are his recommendations. BROOKLYN  GAGE & TOLLNER  (718) 875-5181; 372 Fulton Street, near Smith Street, downtown Brooklyn; all major credit cards    The area around Borough Hall is a field of fast-food restaurants, with stores and offices seemingly just filling the spaces between hamburger stands, pizza places and fried-chicken joints. Fortunately, Gage & Tollner, the bastion of seafood and Southern cooking, lives on, its dignified face blinking a little awkwardly in the tackiness of Fulton Mall.   The gas lamps for which the dark mahogany dining room is renowned are not lighted at lunchtime, but even under electric lights the restaurant retains its turn-of-the-century patina, with arching mirrors, felt-covered walls and a ceiling that wears the residue of more than 100 years of tobacco smoke. Office workers, courthouse regulars and politicians are in attendance at lunch, when there is an $18.95 fixed-price three-course meal and quick lunches ranging from $7.95 to $12.95. Otherwise, lunch can rise into the $25 to $40 range.   This is a chance to sample the peppery she-crab soup, big meaty crab cakes, and a wide variety of fish and shellfish dishes, like pan-roasted clam bellies and fried oysters.   Bourbon pecan pie seems like a perfect (Southern) courthouse dessert, not too sweet, but still as excessive as a good prosecutor's oratory. QUEEN    (718) 596-5954; 84 Court Street, near Livingston Street, downtown Brooklyn; cash only    For Italian meals of a less nostalgic nature, try Queen, a relative newcomer at 35 years of age. There is a brightly dowdy, almost middle-American feel to the dining room, with its blond-wood chairs and pastel colors. The food is a cut more inventive than old-style Italian.   Appetizers are so big that jurors hoping to stay awake for closing arguments can make a meal of a dish like sweet fava beans sauteed in butter and olive oil with earthy cremini mushrooms and tender baby artichokes for $8. Those planning to nap the afternoon away can indulge in a main course of homemade ravioli stuffed with a savory puree of cannellini beans and tomato in a tart balsamic vinegar sauce for $13.   Service is friendly yet formal. A waiter supplements the big basket of bread with piping-hot fingers of fried pizza dough tasting faintly of cheese. THE BRONX Court Deli  (718) 993-1380; 96 East 161st Street, South Bronx; cash only    Bronx Borough Hall looms over 161st Street, as busy a block as any in midtown Manhattan. But where are the restaurants? The area has nothing more to offer than a few coffee shops and bars. \"We just had a tuna fish sandwich sent in from a local pizza joint,\" one courthouse regular said. \"We don't have too many five-star places near the courthouse.\"   When the courthouse regulars do eat out, many go to the Court Deli, a plain but thriving restaurant across the street with linoleum-tile floors, a crowded takeout counter, and gruff but personable waitresses.    Apart from a thick, lusty split pea soup and the sizzling hot dogs, the food is mediocre, probably no better than at Yankee Stadium down the street. The overstuffed sandwiches are generous enough, but pastrami is strictly one-dimensional; it spends too much time on the steam table. But the coffee is good and rich. QUEENS  PASTRAMI KING  (718) 263-1717; 124-24 Queens Boulevard, at 82d Avenue, Kew Gardens; American Express    Jurors assigned to the Kew Gardens courthouse on Queens Boulevard are culinarily fortunate: mavens know that the boulevard is the home of Pastrami King, a classic New York deli that serves world-class pastrami.   Dim, disheveled and full of Formica, this is a place for raucous family gatherings, where babies squeal and adults complain. It's also a clubhouse for the courtroom types and politicos. And it's a place for solitary pleasures, for contemplative chewing of the rich, garlicky pastrami, suffused with an almost vinegary smokiness that comes from 10 to 16 days of soaking and curing over smoldering cedar.   A sandwich is $5.95, and a good-looking, juicy hot dog with sauerkraut is $1.50. Matzoh ball soup ($2) is thin and pallid. MAX'S EATERY  (718) 526-9819; 9504 Sutphin Boulevard, at 95th Avenue, Jamaica; cash only   Jurors at the Jamaica courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard are likely to be a rather hostile group, if the availability of food is any gauge. Simply put, there's not much around. The most worthy spot within walking distance is Max's, an old-time luncheonette several dilapidated blocks south of the courthouse.   Max's does not look much better than the neighborhood. Signs are hand-scrawled, the linoleum-tile floors have seen cleaner days, and coffee is served in plastic foam cups rather than in china mugs. But waitresses call you \"Hon,\" and the polyglot clientele of residents, construction workers and courthouse personnel exudes an aura of good feelings. The Maxi-Burger is big and juicy, served on a fresh poppy-seed roll and strewn with fried onions ($4.70 with bacon and cheese). There are also thick sandwiches and egg creams, and Max Rogalski himself, an aged presence, oversees his bustling staff, lunching on two slices of tomato. STATEN ISLAND  LIL'S EATERY  (718) 273-9555; 95 Stuyvesant Place, at Hamilton Avenue, St. George; cash only    For Staten Islanders, who serve their jury duty within walking distance of the ferry to Manhattan, the temptation to hop aboard for a lunch trip must be great. Rather than risk a tardy return, though, jurors tend to restrict themselves to several fast-food spots in the area, or to Lil's Eatery, a small luncheonette decorated with posters that pay charming homage to stars who met tragic ends, like Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland.   Lil's is a smoky place, with fluorescent lights, Formica tables and an ancient jukebox at each booth, with choices ranging from Bing Crosby to Prince. The menu doesn't stray far from breakfast dishes, sandwiches and burgers. An onion-and-pepper omelet ($5.25) was greasy, and pancakes ($4.95) were doughy, but service was friendly and agreeable. Lil's offers more ambitious specials, like pasta with eggplant for $11.95 and shrimp creole for $12.95. Given the limited choices in the area, I vote for experimentation. MANHATTAN  NHA TRANG  (212) 233-5948; 87 Baxter Street, Chinatown; cash only    With Chinatown right next door to the various courthouses, the choices for the Manhattan juror can be paralyzing. Nha Trang, a plain storefront restaurant with terrific Vietnamese food, stands out. There's a huge menu of more than 100 dishes. Some of the best include perfectly fried spring rolls ($3.50); steamed ravioli, rice-noodle crepes wrapped around minced pork and ground mushrooms, served with mild Vietnamese pork sausage ($3.50), and barbecued shrimp on sugar cane ($5.25). A full meal should cost less than $15.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"THEORY ON MAKEUP OF UNIVERSE GAINS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/us/theory-on-makeup-of-universe-gains.html","abstract":"  In their efforts to understand the formation of galaxies and evolution of the universe as a whole, scientists have come to suspect that some unknown, invisible matter almost certainly makes up more than 90 percent of the mass in the universe.

The food didn't keep anyone away, but it wasn't a highlight, either. \n\nNow, visitors to Hawaii often enjoy sophisticated meals composed of salads featuring local produce; crisp and briny sea vegetables; tropical fruits; remarkably fresh fish, and flavorful beef. All these fine ingredients are transformed into a style of cooking loosely referred to as Pacific Rim, because it reflects the many Pacific cultures residing in Hawaii. In truth, it is impossible to classify, since its roots go back to the Polynesians who settled the islands, the New Englanders who came to colonize them and the sailors from many countries who landed and never left.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"Joanne Shirlaw, Gregory Gersten","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/style/weddings-joanne-shirlaw-gregory-gersten.html","abstract":"  Joanne Shirlaw, the daughter of Joan A.

As little cargo boats emerge from the mist like apparitions, it seems entirely possible that the Three Gorges here in central China were formed not by geological forces but by the goddess Yao Ji and the 12 dragons.   The 12 dragons, as local folk can tell you, used to bully and oppress the peasants along the Yangtze. Then Yao Ji showed up on the top of a nearby cloud and pointed her finger at the dragons, killing them. Unfortunately, the goddess hadn't thought the problem through. The bodies of the dragons left 12 huge mountains that blocked the river and turned the region into a huge sea.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"The Ferocious Fauve","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/books/the-ferocious-fauve.html","abstract":"MATISSE\nA Portrait.\nBy Hayden Herrera.\nIllustrated. 223 pp. New York:\nHarcourt Brace & Company. $29.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"What Is This Thing Called Baby Film?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/style/camera-what-is-this-thing-called-baby-film.html","abstract":"  THIS summer, my wife and I had a baby, and in doing so we entered the strange land of Baby Pictures.

But based on an experience we had two years ago, those reserving there should be sure to get a room in the old building. A newer building has rooms that are infinitely less charming than the main building; indeed, they're rather lifeless. We had specified the old building, got a room in the new building, didn't like it, and successfully insisted on a room in the old building. There's no comparison.  DAN HARRISON  Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. Clyde Haberman responds: While rooms in the new wing may lack the grace of those in the old, some visitors consider them to be more comfortable and also quieter. The morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of the nearby mosque is charming.

Giuliani, sits in front of a painting in a room that could be an office or living room. As she speaks, an image of Mr. Giuliani, casually dressed and surrounded by parents and children, comes on the screen. Then the image of Ms. Giuliani, dressed in a white blouse and blue jacket, returns and the camera pans closer to her until at the end she is being filmed in closeup. Producer; The Garth Group of New York The Script: Ms. Giuliani: Let me tell you about my husband's record on women's rights. In his law practice, Rudy fought for split schedules and extended maternity leave so female lawyers could take care of their families without sacrificing their careers. As U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted an abortion clinic bomber who went to jail for seven years. Rudy helped establish New York City's first on-site childcare center for federal workers and he appointed the first woman in the country to head an Organized Crime Strike Force. And make no mistake about it, Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice. Accuracy: Lawyers who would know whether Mr. Giuliani fought for split schedules as a lawyer in private practice at Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler from 1977 through 1981 could not be reached for comment over the past few days. But in all other respects the commercial is accurate, though perhaps making Mr. Giuliani more central to events than he was. When he was United States Attorney, his office did prosecute the case of Dennis J. Malvasi, an abortion clinic bomber who turned himself in after John Cardinal O'Connor made a televised appeal for him to surrender. He was sentenced in 1987 to seven years in prison. His office was also one of about 10 Federal agencies that provided operating funds for Fedkids, a child care center run by a not-for-profit corporation, that opened in 1988 in 26 Federal Plaza.   And Mr. Giuliani appointed Barbara S. Jones as the first woman in the country to head a federal Organized Crime Strike Force.   Ms. Giuliani winds up her remarks affirming that her husband believes in abortion rights. In 1989, he gave several accounts of his position, before saying that while he opposed aboriton personally as a Roman Catholic, he would support and uphold abortion rights as public policy. Scorecard: The commercial is designed to rebut a commercial by Mayor David N. Dinkins that revives Mr. Giuliani's 1989 hesitations about abortion. It presents his wife, known to New Yorkers as an former anchorwoman for WPIX, to make the case that Mr. Giuliani is a progressive on women's issues. The subliminal message is that if she married him, he has to be someone to whom professional, independent women can relate. The question is whether the same women will see Mr. Giuliani's wife as the best woman to make the case.

The joke works for artists but not photographers, for everyone acknowledges that women photographers have been important all along. Well. When Beaumont Newhall revised his classic \"History of Photography\" in 1982, he increased the number of women mentioned to 13; the first page of his eight-page index lists 38 men. It must be hastily admitted that photography was invented by men and dominated by them well beyond the time that the medium required chemistry and the female sex required smelling salts.   Institutions have not done all that much better than Newhall. Susan Kismaric, curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, told a panel last year that at the end of 1990 the Modern owned work by 1,226 photographers, of whom 172 (14 percent) were women. The exhibition record was slightly more respectable: of 70 one-person shows organized by the museum, 20 (or 29 percent) were of women's work. Yet consider that at this moment women are perhaps more prominent in the field of photography than men -- few men with cameras can claim the audience, press attention, even, at times, the prices of Cindy Sherman, Annie Leibovitz or Sally Mann.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931010","headline":"Elena Zazanis, Yannis Moutafidis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/style/weddings-elena-zazanis-yannis-moutafidis.html","abstract":"  Elena George Zazanis, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. George A.

But the infatuation hardly leads to a love duet; instead, the officer comes actively to dislike his wife along with all Japanese (whom he calls monkeys). Unaffected by his scorn, she appears to love him deeply. She weeps and wails as he prepares to depart. But when he returns unexpectedly to his room, he finds that she has not been a helpless innocent trampled in the mud by a Westerner; she counts her money and coolly awaits her next marital contract.   I suspect that this cynical plot would have been less successful than the one Puccini adapted from David Belasco's play.

Call it, if you will, a kind of musicological optometry.   If time has made it hard for us to see Chopin clearly, familiarity makes it even harder. Chopin's piano music is perhaps the most useful repertory that ambitious virtuosos possess, and its ubiquitous presence dulls the impact of music that ought to startle us.

Ms. Tharp, accelerating Graham movement in a collage with other idioms, has brought out a new virtuosity and range in the dancers. They, in turn, bring the kind of dramatic projection that Ms. Tharp does not find elsewhere, and this has possibly moved her to strike out in a new direction.

A pair of fingers, thick as tree trunks, held a glowing, smoking, four-foot joint; hanging above, on a wall, was an enlarged marijuana leaf. With songs like \"I Wanna Get High\" (including the line, \"Tell Bill Clinton to go inhale\") and \"Hits From the Bong,\" Cypress Hill has made itself a virtual spokesgroup for the pleasures of marijuana. Before the rappers performed, a representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws addressed the audience.    Those who thought marijuana promoted introspection and whimsy could find those qualities in Cypress Hill's music, with its rotund midtempo bass lines, lightly abrasive sound effects and the nasal, singsong vocals of its main rapper, B-Real (Louis Freese).

Serious in all the wrong ways, the music often turned its back on jazz's functional past. At Weill Recital Hall last Tuesday night, the composers Marty Ehrlich and Don Byron brought their chamber groups in for a concert, and for the most part the pieces avoided the drab pretension of most music working in the gray area between the two forms. At their best they embraced humor, rhythm and lyricism, and spoke of the possibilities in literate chamber music that wasn't afraid of the richness of American popular-music tradition.   Mr. Ehrlich's group, the Emergency Peace Ensemble, which includes Vincent Chancey on French horn, Eric Friedlander on cello and Lindsey Horner on bass, showed Mr. Ehrlich to be one of the premier melodicists of his generation. Even his more brittle pieces were filled with melodies that blossomed slowly, or exploded. On \"Underground Overground,\" he unwrapped an idea redolent with the blues that seemed to suck the air out of the room with its power.

Europeans remember his previous term from 1981 to 1989, when his free spending dismayed central bankers and brought Greece close to insolvency. Americans remember him as a former U.S. citizen and an academic economist who later baited Washington. Yet confounding odds, age, ill health and charges of corruption, Mr. Papandreou trounced his conservative rival, Constantine Mitsotakis, in Sunday's election.    His comeback owed much to his opponent's austerity measures and to a split in the ruling New Democracy Party. Even so, Mr. Papandreou's victory is a remarkable personal feat -- especially since eight million voters were aware that their huge national debt was the legacy of his profligate brand of Socialism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931012","headline":"Capitals A Perfect Cure for Rangers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/12/sports/hockey-capitals-a-perfect-cure-for-rangers.html","abstract":"  Glenn Healy knew that falling asleep on the job would not be taken lightly by the man behind the Rangers' bench.

In this disease, the temporal lobes on the sides of the brain, where memory and feelings reside, are intermittently seized by chaotic storms of electrical hyperactivity. Although the seizures may be undetectable to observers, they can prompt symptoms like hallucinations, powerful religious sensations, fury, fear, joy and -- a blessing for those in the arts -- an unquenchable desire to write or draw, a desire that persists even after the seizure is over.   Seizures are different physiological events from episodes of mania or depression, but they can exert on a artists a similar sense of grandeur and mastery. Thom Jones, whose recent collection of extraordinarily original and incantatory short stories, \"The Pugilist at Rest\" (Little, Brown, 1993), is a finalist for the National Book Award, said his temporal lobe epilepsy, which he traces to a brain injury suffered while boxing, profoundly defines his personality and his work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19931012","headline":"Simms and Reeves Forged First Links While on the Links","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/12/sports/pro-football-simms-and-reeves-forged-first-links-while-on-the-links.html","abstract":"  The first time Giants Coach Dan Reeves met quarterback Phil Simms was in Hawaii in January 1992.

But the point is the chance meeting would prove beneficial to both men.
