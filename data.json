Over the last three years, as the economy has sagged, airline carriers have lost more than $10 billion; United alone has lost more than $1 billion. A major problem is that the large carriers, like United, Delta and American, carry huge debt and other fixed costs that don't go away when business falls off.

Written, produced and recorded at the end of Ellington's career, they alternate between the unmitigatedly trivial and the gorgeous. In his use of a gospel choir and his own orchestra, Ellington tried to find common ground between the sacred and the secular, and there's an element of the revue to it, as if Louis Jordan had suddenly stepped in as librettist to make sure things didn't get too serious. But there are also passages of extraordinary beauty, where Ellington's scoring of the material -- one section harmonized two clarinets with an alto saxophone to create an eerie stillness -- is stunning in its vision.   David Berger's version of the \"Sacred Concerts,\" performed on Monday night at the Manhattan School of Music with the Institutional Radio Choir, Jon Hendricks, Wynton Marsalis, William Warfield and others, also showed how fluid the material can be. Mr. Berger modernized the music. Drawing on the three recorded versions, he cut some selections, added excerpts he'd found in the Smithsonian's Ellington archives, and clipped some of the less felicitous moments. He added a vocal chorus, featuring Jon Hendricks (who was meant to be the original singer for the work), and he let the soloists stretch. In a sense the concert became a variety show, with constantly changing textures, improvisers and dancers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931221","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/nyregion/c-corrections-571593.html","abstract":"  An article on Sunday about efforts to restore water quality in the Everglades rendered a percentage incorrectly in a quotation from George Frampton, an assistant Secretary of Interior, about a decline in sugar production that might result from these efforts.

The custom supposedly began with King George II, who by various accounts was either showing his admiration for the music or arriving late. In these times, the posture of royalty no longer has such decisive influence. Nor, in most cases, does a unanimity of Protestant spirit hold sway, as George Bernard Shaw once speculated. So the object of our veneration must be none other than Handel himself, the composer who stirs our souls from across the centuries.   At least 21 performances of \"Messiah\" have taken place in New York this month. In a sense, the numbing repetition of this work is a cause for alarm; it indicates a musical culture governed by habit rather than enthusiasm. Yet the work has a way of making its power known whether it is done well, badly or criminally. The ubiquity of \"Messiah\" may be depressing for various reasons, but it has the virtue of showing the durable force of a true masterwork.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931221","headline":"Pensioners to the Rescue?: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/opinion/IHT-pensioners-to-the-rescue-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"In response to \"Europe's Ailing Pensions\" (Dec. 4) by Erik Ipsen: .Many of today's retirees could do with a lot less than the amount they currently receive in pensions and retirement bonuses.

The Quakers (4-1) opened the season at Southern Cal and won, 77-62, behind junior guard Matt Maloney, who scored 19 points. Their only loss was to Ohio State. Senior forward Barry Pierce is averaging 20 points and 4.8 rebounds, but the team has little depth. Senior forward Andy Baratta is sidelined with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, so Penn will rely on a seven-man rotation.   The Tigers (5-3) finished fourth last season but Coach Pete Carril's club will be better with 6-foot-9-inch junior Rick Hielscher, the league's rookie of the year in 1991-92.    Harvard (5-2) is also off to a fast start. The Crimson's latest victory came Sunday night when they defeated Vermont, 92-64. Michael Gilmore, Darren Rankin and Kyle Snowden each scored 13 points, and Tarik Campbell had 14 assists, one shy of the school record.  Manhattan  Jason Hoover of Queens was named Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference rookie of the week after he replaced the injured Jamal Marshall Saturday against Hofstra. The Jaspers won by 75-59 at Nassau Coliseum and Hoover, a 6-5 forward, scored 15 points, shooting 5 for 7 from the floor and 5 for 6 from the free-throw line. He also collected a game-high 17 rebounds, and leads the league in that category. Buffalo   It hasn't been an easy transition since the Bulls jumped to Division I three years ago. Their latest loss, to Miami by 63-57 Sunday night, dropped the Bulls to 3-5. Last season they finished 5-22.    The Bulls will rely on Modie Cox, a 5-11 point guard. He leads the team in assists, is the second leading scorer (12.7) and is third in rebounding. Forward Myron Banks leads the team with 13-point and 7-rebound averages. But Buffalo should expect more from 7-foot sophomore center Kris Roets, who is getting 2.7 points and 1.3 rebounds in limited playing time.    Freshman Rasuan Young, New York's top high school scorer a year ago, is contributing, with a team-high 12 points against Miami. The Bulls face Duquesne (3-3) tomorrow.   The spotlight is on the first-year coach, Tom Cohane. After he was fired by Dartmouth in 1983, he left coaching and started a trading company on Wall Street. In 1988, while he ran the business, he voluntarily coached the Merchant Marine Academy and led the team to its first appearance in the Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. In 1990, Cohane left his firm and went to Boston College as an unpaid assistant.  Siena  Siena sits atop the M.A.A.C.at 6-2, and Doremus Bennerman is one reason why. The point guard averages 25.4 points a game, which leads the conference.    That hasn't given his backup, freshman Harel Gadot, a lot of time to play. Gadot only averages 2 points and 5 minutes per game. But he is still making progress on this team. A year ago, he was in the Israeli Army. One of the reasons he wanted to play in the United States was fellow Israeli Doron Sheffer, also a former soldier, who averages 10 points as a freshman point guard for UConn.  Monroe   In only its second year in Division III, the Mustangs (9-2) have jumped into the national rankings. They are ranked eighth in the National Junior College Athletic Association, the only school in the Tri-State area to crack the top 10. They got there by defeating then-No. 8 Suffolk Community College and Rockland Community College last week. The Mustangs then fell to Queensboro College, 88-83, committing 31 turnovers. They are led by forward John McCord's 16 points a game. St. John's Women   The Express (3-4) beat Manhattan, 76-61, last Saturday, thanks to the leading scorer, 5-10 senior forward Pam Odom, who is averaging 17.7 points and 6.6 rebounds. The name of the week belongs to her teammate, a junior guard averaging 15.2 points and 3.2 assists: Grace Kelly.   The Express will face Coppin State at Alumni Hall next Dec. 28 in the annual Christmas Invitational.   It was also announced that starting this season, one women's game will be featured every Sunday as the Big East game of the week. The Express will appear on television (the conference has not yet announced which network) at noon on Feb. 6, against Providence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931221","headline":"When Holiday Styles Are Generations Apart","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/us/when-holiday-styles-are-generations-apart.html","abstract":"  Jane Eagen, an insurance broker in Cincinnati, received a hefty bonus, a promotion and a raise last week.

In October, the producers flew in the eminent black American historian Henry Louis Gates Jr., who attempted in a lecture to place the musical in historical context. Some critics responded with indignation at what they saw as a typical display of American imperialism.    Protesting groups abound, and each claims the exclusive right to speak for the special interests it represents. Many of the attacks today on books, films and even musicals are launched in the name of the politics of identity, the principle that outsiders should be banned from speaking for any given minority.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931221","headline":"Inman's Careful Career Of the Unexpected Move","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/us/inman-s-careful-career-of-the-unexpected-move.html","abstract":"  Truly voluntary resignations in Washington are as rare as camera-shy lawmakers, but Bobby Ray Inman, chosen by President Clinton last week to be Secretary of Defense, once racked up two in a year.

It is the voice of the society belle or bright young thing of the 1920's and 30's; the voice of the madcap heiress who talks in quick-step time, going from wit to hysteria to perfect manners to perfect rudeness, stopping to punctuate only when she needs to stop for breath.   American theater patented this style in plays for Lynn Fontanne and Ina Claire. American movies provided Carole Lombard in \"My Man Godfrey\" and Katharine Hepburn in \"Holiday\" and \"Bringing Up Baby.\" English theater gave us the plays of Noel Coward, and English literature gave us the novels of Nancy Mitford, supplemented by endless newspaper stories about the entire Mitford family.   There were six girls and a boy, raised in the English countryside by the overbearing 2d Lord Redesdale and his distantly benign wife. The girls were taught to ride and speak French; they read on their own, and for formal education they depended on the kindness of governesses. They \"came out,\" partied fervently and turned the heads of England's leading noblemen and writers. They were the aristocracy's version of what the Jazz Age called the \"It\" Girl.   Nancy was the eldest and set things in motion by leaving home to dabble in art and journalism, and then to write the novels, essays and biographies that would make her famous. \"People always think I dash off my books with no real work, but it is not so, I very honestly do my best,\" she told her friend and literary counselor Evelyn Waugh. Her novels are still fun to read: group portraits of women in the wilds of upper-class family life, making their way to the far-flung and not especially sheltering outposts of marriage or romance. \"The Pursuit of Love,\" \"Love In a Cold Climate\" and \"The Blessing\" are the best, and actually they are performance pieces: fast-paced episodes of social comedy and self-display in book form.   Her letters, filled with gossip and teases, read that way, too. Waugh had the coldest house in England, she wrote, and Anthony Powell the coldest heart. The Duchess of Windsor had liver spots, \"which confirms my idea that only wicked people get them.\" Randolph Churchill looked like a bombed-out building and exemplified \"a sort of brutal island rudeness.\" After she left England in 1945 to settle in France, she wrote to her mother that it was \"as if I had come out of a coal mine into daylight.\"   World War II had turned the Mitford family comedy into a melodrama with some very ugly climaxes. Six sisters born and brought up to do nothing but sparkle were suddenly called on to think and show character. The results were explosive: Unity Mitford became a Nazi, Diana became a Fascist, Jessica became a Communist and Nancy became what she called much later \"an old-fashioned Liberal.\" She did her sparkling best to stay on good terms with the others, and her letters show that she managed it only by ventilating behind their backs:   Nancy testified against Diana to the British Government in 1940.  (\"Not very sisterly behavior but in such times I think it one's duty?\") She worried that the Communist Party would spoil Jessica's sense of humor. (It did not, as books like \"The American Way of Death\" later showed.) And she said that her youngest sister, Deborah, had the mental age of a 9-year-old and such a wide-eyed devotion to royalty that, finding a book about the French Resistance called \"Maquis,\" \"she thought this was French for Marquis & bought it, but very soon brought it back again.\"   Nancy's letters to her mother are marvels of psychological camouflage: a daughter's version of guerrilla warfare. She respected \"darling Muv,\" she told Jessica in 1971, but never loved her, \"for the evident reason that she never loved me.\" Nine years earlier, when her mother was still living, she had written an essay that asked: \"So what did my mother do all day? She says now, when cross-examined, that she lived for us. Perhaps she did, but nobody could say that she lived with us.\" When Muv protested, Nancy wrote, \"Oh goodness I thought it would make you laugh,\" and went on to posit: \"Anything which now seems odd or unfortunate in my childhood wasn't your fault it was the fault of the age we lived in. Children were not considered then -- or at least girls weren't.\" Then, for reassurance, she added, \"But the person who appears completely vile is me!\"   It isn't true. She could appear brittle and sometimes defiantly shallow. Sad, too: the emotional temperature of the men in her life shows she knew more than anyone should about the pursuit of love in a cold climate. But she was smart, full of fun and honorable when it counted. (When she died in 1973, she left her money in trust to help needy friends and family members.) She was gallant, too. While dying of cancer, she finished a biography of Frederick the Great. She longed, she said, to be a \"pretty young General\" who could gallop over Europe with him \"and never have another ache or pain.\" Frederick also allowed her to deliver a final, ruefully fair verdict on herself. About teasing, she wrote a disapproving scholar: \"I am a tease & I know all about it. There's always surely an element of cruelty. . . . Frederick teased often unkindly & sometimes cruelly but he didn't hang draw & quarter, or rack, or break on the wheel like others of his day. I'd much rather be teased!\"   Pretenses aside, she didn't have just charm. Under pressure, she had character.

Italian Fascism's position on the Jews was much more complicated than this would suggest.
