Even the band members hop all over the stage.   Superchunk is a band of punk classicists, dedicated to the combined power of a good tune, a high-powered beat and blaring power chords. For Superchunk -- as for the Buzzcocks, the Replacements, Husker Du and the early Who -- the disruptive power of punk can coexist with neat pop song structures and one guitar hook after another.

But one September day, Mr. Gage was momentarily distracted and began tamping the blasting powder before his assistant had added sand. There was a powerful explosion.

The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the Federal Government's choice of which bases to close is not subject to challenge in court, thus foreclosing efforts by some states to save facilities in their areas.

The problem for New York is that the President's plan -- and Congressional knock-offs like the recent proposal by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts -- would pay for universal coverage primarily by imposing gargantuan Medicare cuts that are unevenly distributed.    About half of Mr. Clinton's in-patient Medicare cuts would come from hospitals that train doctors and hospitals that serve indigent communities. New York hospitals do a lot of both: they account for 5 percent of national in-patient Medicare expenditures, and about 15 percent of Medicare's contributions toward medical training and indigent care.

subject of a landmark court case on refusal of medical treatment, is the topic of an unusual scientific report today. Using laboratory techniques that were unavailable at the time of her death in 1985, scientists have performed an autopsy on her brain and come up with a surprising finding.   The researchers said they had expected to learn that the most severe brain damage leading to Ms. Quinlan's persistent vegetative state was in the cortex, the gray outer layer where many higher brain functions take place, because autopsies on others in this state had shown extensive damage in that area. But contrary to expectations, the new autopsy found that the major damage was to the thalamus, a structure that is deep in the brain and whose role is less well defined. There was no damage to the brain stem, which controls heartbeat, breathing and other vital functions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940526","headline":"As Senators Go, So Go College Presidents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/l-as-senators-go-so-go-college-presidents-213560.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Why I Am Leaving the Senate\" (Op-Ed, May 13) by Senator David Boren, I predict:","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Why Economic Systems Need Overhaul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/l-why-economic-systems-need-overhaul-213756.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   No political-economic system or theory is applicable at all times to all situations.

But the details, and the money to actually make good on the cuts, was left to future lawmakers.   The 23-to-11 vote, following approval by the House of Representatives last week, is predicated on the belief that the huge loans taken by the state to pay off its accumulated deficit in 1991 will gradually be paid off as the decade closes out. The cuts would phase in over eight years as that debt is paid off.  Republicans Are Critical    Republican opponents in the Democratic-controlled legislature criticized the plan as insulting to voters, who will see little or no benefit this year or next, and unrealistic in any case because almost every provision will have to be passed again by future legislators under future governors. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who has indicated he will sign the tax-cut bill, is not seeking re-election, and the 187 seats in the General Assembly are all up for election in November as well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Review/Cabaret; Morgana King Still Offers Sensuality and Honey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/arts/review-cabaret-morgana-king-still-offers-sensuality-and-honey.html","abstract":"  Three decades after Morgana King made a splash with her feverishly intense version of \"A Taste of Honey,\" the singer, who will be 64 next week, still conveys the aura of a woman in the throes of a sensual obsession.

In Tuesday's opening-night show of her two-week engagement at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street, Chelsea), Ms. King sang a version of \"A Taste of Honey\" that recaptured the tumultuous dreaminess of her original recorded version. Two other songs from \"With a Taste of Honey,\" her landmark 1964 album -- \"Corcovado\" and \"Lazy Afternoon\" -- were among the high points of a set dominated by ballads.

Brahms has his moments of seduction, and indeed, the Hungarian flavors of the familiar A-minor Quartet are inviting. Yet asceticism and lean muscle are the real fabric of all three pieces.   In much the same way, an evening with the Juilliard Quartet is rarely a restful experience. These are intensely thoughtful musicians for whom color is a minor priority and hedonism out of the question. Long legato spans are punctuated, often interrupted, by the Juilliard's surging sense of accent.

Yet despite its sugarcoating, \"Bring In the Morning,\" which opened on Monday at the Variety Arts Theater, frequently crackles with life. Directed by Sheldon Epps, with music by Gary William Friedman and lyrics by Herb Schapiro, the show features an exceptional cast of young performers who portray a cross section of city youths from 16 to their early 20's. About half the time the actors break through the sentimental gloss to express their confusion and defiance, along with a tough humor and an enthusiastic determination to make something of their lives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Early Retirement : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/IHT-early-retirement-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"I am sure many of your readers will protest the elimination of Rex Morgan M.D. from your comics page.

The officers were accused of stealing tens of thousands of dollars from the trunk of a car in Washington Heights.   The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said the unusual grand jury decision underscored the difficulty of prosecuting police officers for corruption because of a state law that prohibits the conviction of a defendant based solely on the testimony of an accomplice. In the case of the two officers, the only evidence against them was the testimony of a third officer who prosecutors said initially shared the loot, which was evidence in a 1992 double homicide.  'An Ideal Example'    \"This case is an ideal example of how the accomplice-corroboration rule creates a shield for the guilty in this state,\" Mr. Morgenthau said. \"Possibly, with this report, the Legislature will understand how detrimental this rule is to the cause of justice.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Shape Up and Stay Influential in Asia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/IHT-shape-up-and-stay-influential-in-asia.html","abstract":"The United States has major problems in its relations with East Asia, notably China and Japan.

The museum is a joint venture of two Manhattan-based organizations, the Dia Center for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation (caretaker of the artist's estate), and Pittsburgh's own Carnegie Museum of Art. Its remarkable, singularly appropriate new home, a handsomely renovated 1911 industrial building redesigned by the New York architect Richard Gluckman, may be the apotheosis of the 25-year-old tradition of the renovated SoHo loft.

When the right chord is played with the right amount of distortion at the right time, a passionless song can transform into a rousing anthem. On Tuesday night at Limelight, Sister Machine Gun, Chemlab and KMFDM -- three bands known for their hard-edged electronic, or industrial, dance music -- added life to their music with heavy-metal riffs.   When the German band KMFDM formed 10 years ago, it was an electronics outfit that didn't use any guitars. At times on Tuesday, however, there were four guitarists grinding away. As a thick drumbeat pounded in the foreground, the guitarists played power chords and driving rhythms. Sascha Konietzko, the drummer, and En Esch traded off on vocals, both growling as diabolically as possible. Their voices were filtered through so much distortion that they sounded nearly identical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Philharmonic Names General Manager","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/arts/philharmonic-names-general-manager.html","abstract":"  The New York Philharmonic has announced that Catherine Cahill will become the general manager of the orchestra on July 1, with responsibility for orchestral affairs, personnel, artistic administration, educational activities and operations.

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope announced that they had found conclusive evidence for the existence of an extraordinarily powerful black hole in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87, which is 50 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. This attractive force of collapsed matter weighs as much as three billion Suns but is concentrated in a space no larger than the solar system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Ambiguity Saves Trade Talks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/ambiguity-saves-trade-talks.html","abstract":"  The trade agreement announced this week by President Clinton and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata does not obligate Japan to stimulate its economy so that it will absorb more imports or open up markets or settle any other dispute. But it does get trade talks back on track -- a welcome reversal after the breakdown in February. Talks should relieve the friction that has focused undue attention on a secondary issue -- the $50 billion bilateral trade imbalance -- that drives these allies apart rather than on Mr. Hata's stalled agenda of political and economic reforms that can pull them together.   Though Japan's overall trade surplus results from its high savings rate, the imbalance with the U.S. is in part because of barriers that shut out U.S. exports and investment. Most economists agree that the harm to the U.S. economy is small. But Japan's practices undermine confidence in trade rules and, most important for Mr. Clinton and Congress, hurt powerful constituents -- like Motorola in the cellular phone market.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"1944:U.S. Patrols Meet : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/IHT-1944us-patrols-meet-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WITH ALLIED ARMIES IN ITALY [From our New York edition:] American 5th Army patrols, advancing rapidly through the enemy-evacuated Pontine Marshes, made contact with patrols from the Anzio beachhead early this morning [May 25], climaxing a dramatic two-wee","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Riley Still Sees A Tough Series","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/sports/pro-basketball-riley-still-sees-a-tough-series.html","abstract":"  Both the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers are unbeaten at home during the playoffs.
