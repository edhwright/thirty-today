There, on opposite sides of the stage, were those old literary jousters, Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer, regarding each other warily, in the midst of a Shavian battle of wits, barely seeming to notice Gay Talese and Susan Sontag standing between them. After contemplating a remark of Mr. Mailer's, Mr. Vidal, resplendent in a dark suit and wine-red vest, crossed to his rival in a majestic saunter and clasped one of Mr. Mailer's hands with his own two.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Irresponsible Ads for Strong Brew","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/opinion/irresponsible-ads-for-strong-brew.html","abstract":"  \"I was the first in my family to go to college,\" intones the narrator, a clean-cut young black man in shirt and tie, pictured relaxing on his front porch in a tough inner-city neighborhood. \"It was a night-school thing, which is cool, because now I can do some good things.\"   No, this isn't a public service spot urging kids to stay in school and avoid drugs.

The slickly produced revue, in which six vocalists and a rock sextet perform more than 30 songs for which Ms. King wrote the music, aspires to be little more than a choreographed concert. If it lacks the theatrical energy, imagination and wit of anthologies like \"Ain't Misbehavin' \" and \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" it offers a richly nostalgic overview of a songwriter whose work seems more traditional today than it did 20 years ago.    Ms. King had the distinction of becoming a pop star a decade after she had established herself as a successful composer of teen-age pop songs with her husband, the lyricist Gerry Goffin. Overnight, it seemed, her phenomenally successful 1971 album, \"Tapestry,\" made the frizzy-haired songwriter with a Brooklyn twang an urban earth mother for the rock generation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Part of Woman's H.I.V.

The provision, by eliminating a measure in the 1986 Tax Reform Act, would make all major gifts to nonprofit organizations fully deductible at current market value rather than at the purchase price, which is nearly always much lower. This would encourage art collectors, for example, to donate paintings to museums rather than holding onto them or selling them on the open market.

Still, an exhibition of Beuys's drawings, even one that encompasses installations and multimedia pieces as this one does, can go only so far. Seven years after Beuys's death at 64, his art remains a maze of conundrums and enigmas. And what show could do more than hint at the charismatic persona that became the essence of Beuys's work through the performances and political activities that made him world famous?   One of the canonical images of 20th-century art is surely the death-masklike image of Beuys himself: gaunt, hollow-eyed and hollow-cheeked, invariably dressed in vest and battered hat. Shaman or charlatan? For more than one generation of politically minded artists, and especially for his fellow German artists, Beuys has been regarded with a reverence matched in its ferocity only by the ridicule that has also been heaped upon him. It was part of his openness of spirit that he reacted to mockery with disarming courtesy. Among the many aspects difficult to reconcile about Beuys was that he was both a kind of megalomaniac and also virtually indifferent to art-world success in the traditional sense.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Republicans Honor Weinberger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/us/republicans-honor-weinberger.html","abstract":"  At a gathering of conservatives attended by three of the men pardoned by President George Bush for their roles in the Iran-Contra affair, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas tonight paid an emotional tribute to Caspar W.

For example, her use of schlock figures from popular culture (in her case the pathetic cartoon characters on greeting cards) preceded Jeff Koons's translation of such figures into sculpture, as demonstrated by \"Hystorical,\" a 1983 painting that hangs in the gallery's office. So it is especially painful to see Ms. Wachtel's latest efforts, which present derivative dilutions of strategies she helped formulate.    These seemingly transitional paintings suggest an amalgam of work made in the 1980's by Richard Prince, Peter Halley and the team of Wallace and Donahue. They combine hard-edge abstraction and daytime television, juxtaposing silkscreened images of faces on the afternoon talk shows with monochrome panels that are variously notched and shaped. The colors and images appear to be subtly matched, both in hue and in emotional vapidness. In \"Massapequa,\" the face of a woman with bright orange lipstick and a greenish tint is embedded in panels of bright orange and green; in \"I'm O.K., You're O.K.\" a stolid male face is framed in panels of anonymous brown and yellow. It turns out that the colors are taken from corporate logos, mall interiors and fast food restaurant uniforms.    To some extent, Ms. Wachtel's subject has always been the falseness of American life, and there is certainly no small relationship between television's canned emotions and the mindless palette of corporate America. But for the moment that relationship remains largely conceptual, more in the artist's head than on canvas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Museum Set to Lose Indian Treasure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/us/museum-set-to-lose-indian-treasure.html","abstract":"  For years, Audrey Stevens, the curator of a small one-room museum in the town library here, treasured the museum's collection of Indian artistry: an array of beaded shirts and purses, suede leggings, wooden pipes and braided locks of human hair.

In its encyclopedic survey of religious feelings, Bach's work had imitated in its musical lines the lashes of a whip, the weeping of the faithful, the fury of a crowd, the mockery of nonbelievers; the music had followed the text of the passion, interpolated with the exquisite commentary of arias and chorales. In the concluding moments, all the contrasts and trials of the story seemed a dream, leaving behind a gentle faith.   This was obviously not, for Mr. Masur, a casual performance. There is, of course, the geographic connection he has with the music: Bach's passion was composed and first heard in Leipzig, where Mr. Masur has been music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra since 1970. But Mr. Masur, in leading 24 members of the New York Philharmonic along with the Westminster Symphonic Choir in this work, also showed a close connection with its dramatic and religious meaning. The strict orthodoxies of authenticity were put aside, without doing harm to the score itself. There were times when matters became mundane, when there was too much stress, or too much exaggeration, but those were minor flaws in a performance that spoke of a deep love for this music and its powers.

When you get done with your sketches and models and blueprints, what do you have?   Well, you might have the camel that was a horse designed by committee. To say the least, you probably would have a polyglot automobile that bespeaks America, Japan, England, France and Italy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Lectures and Liaisons","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/books/l-lectures-and-liaisons-994593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Perry Meisel's appreciative review of \"Freud, Jung, and Hall the King-Maker: The Historic Expedition to America (1909)\" (Jan. 24) reflects the structure as well as the content of my book.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Giants Have Plenty of Twists of Fate to Ponder","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/sports/baseball-notebook-giants-have-plenty-of-twists-of-fate-to-ponder.html","abstract":"  If major league club owners had immediately permitted a Florida group to buy the San Francisco Giants and move them to St. Petersburg; if Bill White, the National League president, had not extended an invitation for someone -- anyone -- in San Francisco to make an offer for the Giants; if Peter Magowan and his group hadn't charged out of the Bay Area gloom to rescue the damsel in distress, Candlestick Park would be a legendary memory, Barry Bonds would be in someone else's outfield and Dusty Baker wouldn't be the Giants' manager.

The country is \n\nreading \n\nthe 1965 book once again, as avidly, it seems, as it is seeing Mr. Lee's movie. For 17 weeks \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X,\" written with the assistance of Alex Haley, has been on the New York Times paperback best-seller list, and for 10 of those weeks it was No. 1. Today, on the 28th anniversary of his assassination, Malcolm's story has become as American -- to borrow H. Rap Brown's famous aphorism -- as violence and cherry pie.\n\nMalcolm first came into my life some three decades ago, when I was 9 years old and Mike Wallace and CBS broadcast a documentary about the Nation of Islam. It was called \"The Hate That Hate Produced,\" and it showed just about the scariest black people I had ever seen: black people who talked right into the faces of white people, telling them off without even blinking. While I sat in our living room, I happened to glance over at my mother. A certain radiance was slowly transforming her soft brown face, as she listened to Malcolm naming the white man as the devil. \"Amen,\" she said, quietly at first. \"All right, now,\" she continued, much more emphatically. All this time and I had not known just how deeply my mother despised white people. The revelation was terrifying but thrilling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Composting Odors Roil East Moriches Neighbors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/nyregion/composting-odors-roil-east-moriches-neighbors.html","abstract":"HOMEOWNERS in East Moriches say they are tired of holding their noses.

Last week, Seles beat Navratilova in three sets at Chicago. Navratilova has lost only four times since losing in the second round of the United States Open in September.

Stewart, seeking an end to a non-winning streak that began after his 1991 United States Open victory, put his drive to the right on the fourth hole and took a drop from a cart path. In taking his stance, however, he got his right foot on the paved path -- a violation of the rules. He got a ruling from an official on the ninth hole and was assessed a two-shot penalty that enabled Rummells to vault into the lead.

Polgar   9       Bareyev   9       Speelman   8       Gurevich, I.   7       Nunn   7       Sadler   7       Polugayevsky   5 1/2       Crouch   3 1/2         In her final-round game with Bareyev, Polgar gave one more bright illustration of her formidable power in attack.   The motive of the Burn Variation of the French Defense with 4 . . . de is to yield Black's strongpoint in the center to avoid a later cramping e5 and to bring about exchanges that would largely nullify White's advantage in space. In this way it copies Black's strategy in the main lines of the Caro-Kann Defense. But Bareyev never got beyond the one exchange with 7 Nf6 Nf6.   Rather than castle on the kingside early, Bareyev first finished the development of his queenside with 10 . . . Bb7, yet after 11 Qb5 Nd7 12 O-O-O, his lack of space was becoming more noticeable. And it became more noticeable still after Polgar's 14 c4 thrust.   On 17 Bd3, Bareyev probably should have tried 17 . . . Bd3, although his problems would not have been solved. For example, after 18 Rd3 Nf6?! 19 f5!, Black will quickly go under. Instead, he defiantly grabbed a pawn with 17 . . . Bg2 and faced a powerful attack after 18 Rhg1 Bd5 19 Qc2. Since Polgar was threatening to blast open the black king position with 20 f5, he blocked that possibility with 19 . . . f5, which was also intended to let him use his KR for defense.   Polgar aggressively charged with 21 c6!, crowding the black pieces even more.   On 22 Ne5, Bareyev's 22 . . . Bh4 prevented a doubling of the white rooks with 23 Rg3 and Rdg1, but Polgar revved up her onslaught with 23 Qe2 Qf6 24 Qh5.   On 24 . . . Red8, Polgar struck the annihilating blow with 25 Rg7! Bareyev could not play 25 . . . Qg7 because 26 Qh4 Kh8 27 Rg1 Qh7 28 Qf6 forces mate. But on 25 . . . Kg7 26 Rg1 Kh8 (26 . . . Kh7 is crushed by 27 Ng4! Qg6 28 Qh4 Be4 29 Be4 fe 30 Qe7 Kh8 31 Nf6) 27 Nf7 Kh7 28 Nh6!, Bareyev gave up in the face of 28 . . . Qh6 29 Qf7 Kh8 30 Qg8mate.

Considering the local crime wave that he sets off when he takes a chauffeur's job with a rich, mean farmer and his young, bored wife, Cully has good reason to feel he's in a rut. Not so the author, an auto mechanic from Paoli, Pa., whose precision-tuned first novel purrs with professionalism.   Readers who share Mr. Watts's fondness for Elmore Leonard and earlier    noir    models might be tempted to anticipate the drift once the boss's wife, Michelle, seduces Cully into betraying and robbing her husband. (Haven't we all seen this movie before?) But the author has many more plot curves and character bends to execute before getting this baby home to the garage. There's no predicting the nastiness that Michelle's psychotic former husband is capable of, and you'll never guess the stunt that her sister pulls during a bank holdup. Although Mr. Watts delivers all the sleazy sex, slick con games and fatalistic acts of violence that define the opaque    noir    vision, he writes with enough originality to map out his own route.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"'Twentysomethings' Can Give to Society","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/nyregion/l-twentysomethings-can-give-to-society-143093.html","abstract":"  As a \"twentysomething\" male who recently returned to his parents' empty nest, I certainly relate to the young people featured in \" 'Twentysomething' and Home Again on L.I.\"  [ Jan. 31 ] .

Revere, founded on Long Island in 1979 by Robert J. and Susanna M. Scaretta, is one of more than 200 armored car services that have gone into business since the late 1970's, when a series of antitrust court decisions forced what were then the industry's predominant companies, Brink's and Wells Fargo Armored Service, to sell off some of their fleets and give up some of their markets.    \"We shouldn't be too surprised by what happened here,\" said Robert McCrie, a professor of security management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. The collapse of Revere, he said, came at a time when hundreds of small armored car companies have sprung up across the nation, and banks have failed to check their competence or integrity. No New Regulations    \"It is the greater fools' approach to security,\" he said. \"The banks may know something is amiss with an armored car company, but they also know it is insured.\"   But while the court decisions reorganized the industry, neither Congress nor state legislatures stepped in with any new regulations covering who could run -- or even work for -- an armored-car company.    \"About all it takes is a truck, a warehouse and a big table to count the cash,\" Mr. McCrie said.   There is one other practical requirement -- insurance. As the number of armored-car companies has expanded, and the industry has become more competitive, the experts say one major insurer, Lloyd's of London, has emerged not only as the dominant underwriter of armored-car companies, but the only serious watchdog over their operations.  Insurer Undecided    In the Revere case, the authorities say that the Scarettas and their employees may have absconded with as much as $40 million from their clients, including Citibank and the National Westminster Bank. Although Lloyd's covered Revere against losses, lawyers for the insurer said this week that it had not yet decided whether to honor all claims.   Whether Lloyd's fully compensates Revere's clients, analysts say the case serves as a reminder of the need for greater scrutiny -- and perhaps greater regulation -- of the armored car industry.   \"A lot of banks have got to do a lot better job with their security,\" said Ira A. Lipman, president of Guardsmark, a major security consulting concern in Memphis.  A Costly Lesson    In Revere's case, \"the banks end up with egg on their face,\" said Mr. McCrie. Even if Lloyd's reimburses them for what has been found missing from Revere's warehouse, \"their investigatory and legal fees in this case are going to cost them a lot, and maybe teach them a lesson.\"   The owner of one armored-car company said the banks have sacrificed security for low costs.   \"The banks may say they want the best company, but what they really want is the lowest rate,\" he said. \"In the end, banks are more worried about who collects their trash than who they hire as an armored car carrier.\"  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"In the Region: Long Island;\nWhat's Next for Foreclosed Wyndham?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/realestate/in-the-region-long-island-whats-next-for-foreclosed-wyndham.html","abstract":"A COURT'S decision late last year upholding a foreclosure action against the developer of the Wyndham condominium in Garden City has left the 27 apartment owners in the 316-unit complex with mixed emotions.\n\nTheir hope is that a responsible buyer, not a speculator eager for quick profit, will now step in to finish the project, market it and bring values back up.

After every few words, I glanced across the top of the screen at my husband, slit and stitched up and webbed in plastic tubing, so wasted and waxy that I had to keep reminding myself: \n\nThis is George. You know him. You have loved him for almost 30 years. \n\n\"I suppose there are millions of us at this very moment in just the same pain,\" I tapped on the keys. \"Why do I feel so singular?\"\n\nThere must have been millions keeping bedside vigils, whispering as I whispered over and over, \n\nCome back. Don't leave me. I need you, \n\neach of us trapped in this profound and irrational solitude, as though walls of black glass had dropped on every side, shutting out the light, deadening all sound but the loved one's morphine-drugged breathing. I was not, in truth, alone. Was it that suspicion that had driven me before, and would goad me again, to write intimately about illness, disability and death? And does the same suspicion provoke others to tell their stories -- so much like mine, so absolutely their own?

Because the line could not fill one ship with the three- and four-day passengers, it put them on our larger seven-day cruise ship, the World Renaissance. This meant that after four days, the ship spent 24 hours returning to Piraeus to discharge the four-day passengers and pick up the three-day ones.

In music, the situation may not be clear: musical censorship in the former Soviet bloc was much more intricate and less literal than in literature; meanings are harder to discern and styles harder to define. And that world has been transformed so violently that it is hard to know what cultural forces will hold sway.   But the fact is, in music here, anything does go, while in the music of Mr. Lutoslawski and several of his Eastern European and Russian colleagues, much more seems to matter.

Although Mr. Harrer includes shots of marketplaces, mounted archery contests and masked dancers in aprons of human bones, his most successful pictures are less exotic and far more surprising: members of the Lhasa cabinet inspecting a dike in a yak-hide coracle, holding umbrellas with a Victorian formality; the Dalai Lama's brother on a riverbank in sophisticated dark glasses and what looks like a silk dressing gown. In other images, monks skate on ice and cheat at cards, beefy police-monks brandish great staves, and criminals in ankle shackles beg by the side of the road. Mr. Harrer came to Tibet in 1944, at the age of 32, after escaping from a British internment camp in north India; he and a companion spent two years walking to Lhasa and arrived nearly starved. He was befriended by the Tibetan nobility and worked as a Government employee.

His family and supporters call it a lynching disguised as a suicide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930221","headline":"Jennifer Weiner, Mark Hirschhorn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/style/engagements-jennifer-weiner-mark-hirschhorn.html","abstract":"  Dr. and Mrs. Max Weiner of New Rochelle, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Jennifer Sharon Weiner, to Mark Jason Hirschhorn, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Howard Hirschhorn of Colts Neck, N.J.

One thing is clear about the 189-year-old institution: if it is to emerge from its latest crisis, it must finally become a different, and probably leaner, institution.   Different from what, you might ask. For much of its history it was run so like a private club that few people had the slightest idea what was housed within its somber limestone walls on Central Park West. Not much has changed even during the last few years, when the society, reeling from its last near-death encounter, has tried to attract a wider public. Yet while millions of people each year streamed into the American Museum of Natural History across the street, at its peak in 1992 the society drew only 93,000 visitors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930221","headline":"There's Life After Scars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/21/style/egos-ids-there-s-life-after-scars.html","abstract":"  NAME: Marla Hanson.
