Mosquitoes and biting flies have been conquered with jungle-formula repellent, and one learns to live with the rest and get on with enjoying the sights and sounds of their domain.\n\nThe other hazards of this vast forest, known as the Peten, are either rare or comical. Coral snakes and deadly fer-de-lances are seldom seen along the trails, and big cats like the jaguar and its smaller cousin the ocelot have been hunted to near extinction. If irritated, the spider monkey's most common tactic is to hurl half-eaten fruit or urinate on passers-by, and the howler monkeys sound much more threatening than they are.

The company, through direct and secondary employment, today supports 1,122 permanent full-time jobs here on Long Island. These jobs account for $55 million in annual payroll.

Together they produced an environment that was antagonistic toward children, she says.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Kristin Williams, Stephen Mugford","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/style/weddings-kristin-williams-stephen-mugford.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. James W.

So \"The Naughty Nude,\" a cheerful, unpretentious, low-key show at Gallery 292 in SoHo (through Jan. 16), is a gaggle of coquettes, some in brassieres or petticoats, none in jockey shorts. The operative term for these 19th- and 20th-century come-ons is indeed \"naughty.\" Though there are warrantied works of art among these 60-odd photographs -- a 1950's Bill Brandt, Andre Kertesz's \"Satiric Dancer\" (who has mysteriously strayed in in a dress) -- the atmosphere tends to the kitsch, the camp and the cozy.   In French postcards, women with bare bottoms smile at themselves in mirrors; others strip down so they can enjoy a cigarette to the full. A Ziegfeld girl named Gladys Glad poses in a shawl of gauze and lace that exposes everything the censor would allow. The gallery claims that a group of turn-of-the-century nudes by Albert Penot are in the tradition of Delacroix and Degas -- but let the viewer be the judge. If pornography is explicit and art is genteel, then these familiar types of ads and postcards and other staples of the titillation trade fall somewhere in between.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"19 Contaminated By Nuclear Leak","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/us/19-contaminated-by-nuclear-leak.html","abstract":"  A leak of radioactive material has contaminated workers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and officials asked Friday that the families of some of the workers be tested for radiation exposure.

Here, tourist shops and boutiques outnumber even churches. To find the perfect Venetian keepsake requires some serious looking beyond display windows jammed with handcrafted trinkets and baubles, leather and paper goods, antiques and glass objects of every description, jewels and costume jewelry and of course the ubiquitous mask. One marvels at the sheer number of these shops all seemingly selling the same things. But then a closer look reveals that they are not all alike, that here and there are shops selling their own fine stock, where talented Venetian artisans are preserving the jeweled world of Veronese and Titian. The trick is to find them. \n\nThe problem for the ardent shopper in search of a serious purchase is that there is no one street dedicated to shopping, with the possible exception of the Via Frezzeria near St. Mark's Square. At 1691 Via Frezzeria, for example, Mirella Spinella's boutique, called simply M Antichita (telephone 5235666), is one of the city's most elegant. A look through the large window reveals an amazing assortment of fine antique furniture, paintings and bibelots. A handsome 18th-century desk or an antique silver box provides the background for the luxurious hand-blocked velvet cloaks and cushions the owner designs. (Cushions sell for about $100 (prices calculated at 1,400 lire to the dollar); full-length fur-trimmed cloaks go up to $1,500. The exquisite jewelry fashioned by another young Venetian artisan, Monica Zecchi, completes the picture of Venetian opulence. The Zecchi pieces in the shop's window are not for low budgets: An antique gold pendant embellished by tourmalines, hanging from a heavy gold chain, is obviously a one-of-a-kind piece designed by a skilled craftsman. Zecchi's necklaces show an imaginative use of semiprecious stones such as garnets, rose quartz and lapis lazuli set in gold; they start at around $1,800. Made-to-order pieces combining rubies, sapphires or emeralds sell for as much as $11,000. Even if you're not planning any large expenditures, this is a place worth seeing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Judith Seibert, Gary R.

The most attractive is the Dhulikhel Mountain Resort, 20 miles from Katmandu along the road to Tibet and overlooking terraced mountainsides. The lodge, with its 17 Nepali-style cottages (36 rooms in all) and spacious indoor-outdoor restaurant, climbs the same hillside as village farms. The modern rooms and suites all have private baths.

The many warnings that Russians themselves -- including Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin -- have issued since 1989 about trends toward breakdown, fragmentation, anarchy and civil war sound steadily more real. True, the recent congress of the Russian Parliament just avoided becoming the brawl that it threatened to turn into at one point. But the cost was postponing painful decisions, deepening the gridlock of government and weakening Mr. Yeltsin to the point where Mr. Gorbachev's charge that he is \"losing his grip\" rang true.\n\nIt is still possible in theory to sketch a more hopeful scenario, based on the legendary stoicism of Russians in the face of chaos and deprivation. We may also hope that, before too long, Russia will emerge from its agonies and set itself on the road to a better future. And we can be certain that far from all the heroic efforts made by Russians in recent years to develop businesses, build democratic institutions, strengthen religious freedom and foster a free culture will be wasted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Huson Agrees to Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/sports/sports-people-baseball-huson-agrees-to-deal.html","abstract":"  A day after becoming the first player in the majors to file for salary arbitration this year, infielder JEFF HUSON yesterday agreed to a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers.

Their work sowed the seeds for a radical transformation of painting, the meaning of which is still being explored by artists today. In COLLAGE, ASSEMBLAGE, AND THE FOUND OBJECT (Abrams, $85), Diane Waldman follows the unfolding of collage as both a medium and a process in art, from Cubism and Dada through the work of such different artists as Vladimir Tatlin, Richard Hamilton and David Wojnarowicz. The author, the deputy director and senior curator of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, notes how the distinctions between found object and painting have blurred, as in the work of Anselm Kiefer, who incorporates items such as lead, straw and clothes into grim, monumental works about human destiny and guilt. In a new twist on the found object, artists like Sherrie Levine incorporate reproductions of previous masterpieces into their own creations. Finally, Ms. Waldman proposes that the connections between art and life suggested by the first collagists have deepened, with artworks being treated not as sacred relics but as part of the mishmash of the ordinary world from which, as Duchamp suggested, it is possible not just to create art but also simply to \n\nsee \n\nit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/books/c-corrections-266493.html","abstract":"  A picture caption on Dec. 13 with a review of \"Kurt Weill: Composer in a Divided World\" included an erroneous identification, from the book, for an actor in the 1943 production of \"One Touch of Venus.\" He was John Boles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"MORRISTOWN JOURNAL;\nCommunity Up in Arms Over Plan for New Jail","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/nyregion/morristown-journal-community-up-in-arms-over-plan-for-new-jail.html","abstract":"MORRISTOWN'S jail, built to hold 145 inmates, now averages 300.

The shape of things to come in the next four years will be partly colored by the history of Bill Clinton's generation and the ideals of community it has formed. The yearning for a public realm figures strongly in the mythology of the baby boomers. They came of age, legendarily, at Woodstock, a gathering of strangers brought together chiefly by the chance to be together. The music was almost a pretext.

As measured by the calendar, three decades have passed since the tension-filled Moscow premiere of the symphony, which generated great acclaim in the auditorium (no review was allowed to be printed in Pravda) and then for several years virtually disappeared.   In the end, however, what has disappeared is not the symphony but, astonishingly, the seemingly implacable Soviet system, which had furnished the symphony's subject matter, and then imposed that awful silence. This might be called a geopolitical measurement of the gap.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930110","headline":"Flying for Those In Wheelchairs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/10/travel/practical-traveler-flying-for-those-in-wheelchairs.html","abstract":"  EILEEN FORD, the co-owner of Ford Models, bought a ticket to Paris on the Air France Concorde last fall while she was recovering from a broken heel.

All undergraduates must now take one course that examines a non-European culture, a second that addresses issues of race, religion and ethnicity in America and a third that explores issues of gender roles and relationships.   Left intact were existing requirements that students take at least one course each in the mathematical sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences; philosophical, social and religious thought; literature and the fine arts. Though the university had previously required students to take a course each in the social sciences and behavioral sciences, it combined these two categories into a single requirement.   \"Like the four basic food groups, to have a balanced intellectual diet you should have a dish from each of these,\" said Peter Duus, a history professor who headed the Undergraduate Studies Committee when it oversaw the curriculum changes.   In part, say faculty members, those changes came about as an acknowledgment of the diversity of Stanford's own student body. Of this year's 1,600 freshmen, 45 percent are Asian, black, Hispanic or American Indian. But in broader terms, the revisions reflect the university's changing view of how best to prepare students for the challenges of today's world.   \"Basic to the general education of an informed citizen of the nation there has to be an understanding of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of our society,\" said Albert Camarillo, a history professor and associate dean of undergraduate studies in the School of Arts and Sciences. \"That is the basic idea.\"   But unlike many colleges, Stanford does not require students to take the same set of courses. To satisfy the world culture requirement, for example, students can choose from among some 30 courses. One Stanford graduate might walk away with an understanding of Zen Buddhism, while another will have a grasp of the contemporary history of Iran.   \"You could probably find under any one area that students will take one of five or six courses,\" Professor Duus said. \"But if you look at a student's transcripts, the only course they will have in common is 'Culture, Ideas and Values.' \"   What is lost in the absence of a shared core of classes, said Carol Schneider, executive vice president of the American Association of Colleges in Washington, is discussion outside the classroom among faculty members and students of the ideas they would all be studying.

Mr. Astin, known to television viewers as Gomez in the \"The Addams Family,\" sings hoarsely and tiptoes around upper notes by means of little shouts, but he bestows a deftly manic approach on his famous opening sequence and has the verbal agility to keep Gilbert's fast-moving patter under control.

The program had been postponed from Dec. 11. The juxtaposition of Church of England theatrics and South American tradition was initially jarring, but the performances had enough conviction to make the combination seem almost logical.   The Britten work is based on the life of the fourth-century bishop Nicolas, a rather fierce and fanatic dispenser of good works whom the modern figure of Santa Claus echoes as faintly as possible. The narration of various miraculous episodes culminates in Nicolas's bringing back to life three boys who had been killed and cooked by an unscrupulous butcher (sort of \"Peter Grimes\" in reverse). While the music is not Britten's finest, it has an immediate ceremonial effectiveness. Mr. Gardner expertly balanced and controlled the various vocal and instrumental forces, even though his chorus did not have an especially polished sound.

Every time Jupiter emerged from a cartoon cloud that opened like an elevator, a bell rang as if the deity were arriving at the ladies' foundations area of a department store. Sometimes the costumes made it seem that way as well: the nymph Pasithea appeared in an outfit that might have been from Frederick's of Hollywood, a bright red garter belt and stocking outfit with a white feather boa and a pair of handcuffs. Jupiter jumped into a bubble bath, apparently in his birthday suit. Even the musicians did not keep their minds on the score.   This was a production of \"Semele\" but hardly the \"Semele\" that Handel's operatic setting gives us with its pastoral scenes and hints of high tragedy. This opera is based on the very same libretto (written by the Restoration dramatist William Congreve) and was completed by the English composer John Eccles in late 1706. It takes the same story from Ovid, of the young girl (Semele) in love with a god (Jupiter); she is tricked by the god's jealous wife (Juno) into demanding to see him in divine form; she dies from the exposure. The composer -- Purcell's heir in the English theater -- never heard the work. It is influenced by Italian opera, with declaimed recitatives and da capo arias, but by the time \"Semele\" was ready for performance, the fashion in London demanded authenticity: operas in Italian from Italy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930111","headline":"Cowboys are Quicker on the Draw","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/11/sports/pro-football-cowboys-are-quicker-on-the-draw.html","abstract":"  Dallas's third touchdown, which gave them a 24-3 lead and put the game all but out of reach, came on a 23-yard run by Emmitt Smith in the third quarter. It came on a draw play that is one of the Cowboys' favorites; that also means they often execute it better than other plays because they enjoy running it. They have used it all season long and in both previous games against Eagles. No doubt Philadelphia had prepared for the play, so the fact that the Cowboys scored on it indicates how well it was executed.    Basically, it's a cutback draw. The Eagles knew this draw would be run but did not recognize it from this formation, which was a formation Dallas had been using in this game but not running the draw play on.

From the onset, Redford insisted on using flies that mimicked natural food forms rather than those flies known as \"attractors\" -- crass, overdressed lures which basically annoy trout into striking them. Redford's position, leaked early to the trades (\"Ordinary Bob Nixes Fruit Flies for Fish Pic\"), was part of the aura of integrity that had prevented his movie from being made for 14 years, but authenticity had its price.

Ann Stock, the vice president of public relations for Bloomingdale's, who divides her time between Washington and the New York department store, is Hillary Clinton's choice for a job that to some is as important as the White House chief of staff and, in its own way, wields almost as much power.   Nicki Hedrick, director of media relations at Bloomingdale's, confirmed today that Mrs. Stock had resigned to take the White House job, where she will hold sway over who gets invited to Presidential functions. Mrs. Clinton's office refused to comment on the appointment.   \"If you care about going to the White House it's a very powerful job,\" said Carolyn Peachey, president of Campbell, Peachey & Associates, a public relations firm. Intense Competition    After 12 years in a city where the most sought-after invitation is to a White House dinner, there are a lot of Democrats clamoring to get on the list.   Competition for the social secretary's position was intense. \"It always has been,\" said Sheila Tate, who was press secretary to Nancy Reagan and is now president of Powell Tate, a public relations firm. \"The job has great cachet.\"   Mrs. Stock, a former deputy press secretary to Vice President Walter F.  Mondale, was chosen from a list that included Ms. Peachey, who did not want to be considered; Susan O'Neill, daughter of the former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.; Liz Stevens, wife of the film director George Stevens, and Alma Viator, a vice president of the National Theater.   A number of people prominent in Georgetown's social circle were surprised by the choice, and telephone calls today soliciting their responses often began with comments like the one from Polly Kraft, wife of the lawyer and former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler: \"Do I know her?\" She Knows Washington    Mrs. Stock may not be a household name to the Georgetown crowd, but she has long experience in the capital. \"It's good that no Georgetown ladies know her,\" said Ms. Tate. \"She's fresh and unspoiled. She's a hard worker and she certainly knows Washington.\"   Everyone agrees that the White House social secretary should know Washington so as to navigate the treacherous political waters and the rocky protocol shores.   \"It's very important,\" said Muffie Brandon, now director of corporate programming for the Ford Motor Company and social secretary to Nancy Reagan from 1980 to 1983. \"The intricacies of this city, the nuances of political life and of protocol are not things you can learn on the job.\"    Mrs. Stock is not new to politics or to Washington. Besides working for Mr. Mondale, she volunteered for the Capital Children's Museum and helped raise the money to open it.  Other Qualifications    Those who know Mrs. Stock describe her as energetic, enthusiastic and creative, highly organized and very professional, qualities that are important in such a sensitive job.   \"There are toes that don't need to be stepped on,\" said Ms. Tate. \"You need to genuflect to certain people. It's important that she knows the traps and avoids needlessly offending people, just in terms of the Hill and the traditions and all the protocol.\"   Mrs. Stock, who is 46 and lives in nearby Alexandria, Va., graduated from Purdue University, where she majored in elementary education. She has been married to Stuart Stock, a partner at Covington & Burling, for 22 years. They have a 13-year-old son, Chase, who is a student at the Potomac School in McLean, Va.   She is a member of the Overseas Economic Fund's Women in Business Committee and founded the Washington Woman Roundtable, a group of 1,000 female executives who meet every three months to network. She was founder of Washington's \"Race for the Cure\" against breast cancer, and helped to organize the same event in New York City.   Mrs. Stock could not be reached for comment.

It's a sequel to what is called the summer press tour, when the networks explain why the shows they are putting on for the fall season will be hits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930112","headline":"Evolution of Tabby Cat Mapped in Brain Study","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/12/science/evolution-of-tabby-cat-mapped-in-brain-study.html","abstract":"  BY comparing the brains of Spanish wildcats and American domestic tabby cats, a researcher in Tennessee has discovered a biological mechanism that may explain how members of a species may adapt their brains to undergo rapid evolutionary change.   The finding is that wildcats and domestic cats develop the same number of brain cells as fetuses, but in each species different sets of neurons are killed off just before birth. The result is presumably that each cat's brain is better adapted to fit its environment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930112","headline":"Observer; The Latest Duke","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/12/opinion/observer-the-latest-duke.html","abstract":"  At these times Washington is like an old courtesan taking a new lover.
