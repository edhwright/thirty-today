Boston was 62 when \"The Children of Green Knowe\" came out, and she had already led several lives. She had dropped out of Oxford to become an army nurse in World War I. While in France, she had married a British fighter pilot. Later, when the marriage broke up, she became a painter and went to live in Italy. When World War II began, she returned to England and bought an 800-year-old house near Cambridge. She then spent many years returning it to its original 12th-century state. Owning that house led to her book.\n\nAlso in 1954, in the United States, another late-blooming children's writer published a book -- not his first, but his first really good one. Edward Eager was 43 when \"Half Magic\" appeared. He too had already lived a lot. He had dropped out of Harvard to write plays, having already written one while still an undergraduate, a play so successful that he lived for some time on the royalties. When he turned out not to be a major playwright, he drifted into the then-new world of television and discovered he had a talent for adapting grand operas, so as to make them sufficiently ungrand for small screens. He married, became a father and grew passionately fond of reading aloud to his son. While doing so, he first encountered the classic children's writer E. Nesbit. That encounter led to his book.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Wendy Weisner, Todd Cooperman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/style/weddings-wendy-weisner-todd-cooperman.html","abstract":"  Wendy Joy Weisner, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alvin A.

IDENTITY: Professional tennis player, 23. Ranked No. 7 in the world in women's tennis. NEXT ACTIVITY: Competing in the Virginia Slim's tournament at Madison Square Garden, which begins tomorrow.  HOMES: Buenos Aires and Key Biscayne, Fla.  Q.  How is your game going? A.  I'm playing very well. This year wasn't probably the best one. I didn't win any tournaments, and it was a little bit weird because I was sick at the beginning of the year. Q.  What places are your favorites to play in? A.  I love New York. But in Italy, the people go crazy. It seems like a soccer match, because they scream. They have signs with my name. They sing a song. Q.  What kind of song?  A.  I don't know. Something where they mention my name. My family comes from Italy. My name is Italian.  Q.  Are the players on the tour still shaken up by the stabbing of Monica Seles? A.  You know, when we go to play, we don't think about it. But you can find these people everywhere. It could happen any moment. We have to be very careful. Especially when we walk around in a tournament, there is always someone with me.  Q.  A personal bodyguard? A.  No. The tournament provides someone. Q.  How accepting are people of Martina Navratilova and other lesbian players on the circuit? A.  I don't know how it was before, but right now each person does their own life. I go on and play and try to do my own life and be with my people. I like to go there and play and then leave.  Q.  What are you listening to these days?  A.  I like to listen to the radio, but I haven't found any good songs. Nothing new. I listen to soft rock like Phil Collins, Chicago, Air Supply, Jon Secada. I love music, and sometimes I like to write it down and then sing it, too. Q.  Are you saying you'd like a second career as a pop singer? A.  I would like to do something in the future, something with music. I don't know what's going to happen. My personal dream is to have a family, get married and have kids. Q.  Do you really have two perfumes with your name? A.  Yeah, we started with Gabriela Sabattini in 1989. For the first fragrance I chose the scent and the package and the colors. It was a lot of fun for me. Q.  And for the second one? A.  The second one is called Magnetic. For that I had to choose between two different scents. Q.  Why did you choose the one you did? A.  I don't know. It has different flowers, but it's not because of that. I just tried it on and I felt like it was going more with my personality. Q.  How would you describe your personality?  A.  Publicly calm, very sensitive and honest.  Q.  And serious? A.  No, not really, when I'm around people that I know.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Karen Miller, Matthew Henley","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/style/weddings-karen-miller-matthew-henley.html","abstract":"  Karen Gayle Miller, the daughter of Nancy and Henry Miller of Somerset, N.J., was married yesterday to Matthew Joseph Henley, the son of Betsy and Joseph Henley of Bedford, Ind.

But since 1988, the offerings have grown complex, with about half a dozen international versions now available for a certain number of days over a particular period, with options for auto rentals and air travel, plus national passes. Figuring out if buying a pass for rail travel will be cheaper than buying individual tickets is a process that seems like fun only to people who like to do their own income taxes. And the choice should be made ahead of time, because the prices are higher in Europe.    For 1994, Rail Europe, the North American sales agent for most European railroads, has created yet another pass. That one, however, could simplify the shopping, because its sponsors say the five countries it covers -- France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland -- are the ones that 80 percent of United States rail-pass buyers visit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Fashion Imagery That Can Upstage the Clothes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/arts/photography-view-fashion-imagery-that-can-upstage-the-clothes.html","abstract":"  In 1953 the french movie director Francois Truffaut proposed that certain directors should be considered auteurs, the authors of their films, though they had not written the scripts. In 1963, the critic Andrew Sarris introduced the term over here and expanded it to include American film makers like Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford, who had not been mentioned before in the same breath as the likes of Jean Renoir or Ingmar Bergman. That movie making was a collective enterprise was well known; the auteur theory acknowledged that some directors stamped a personal, distinctive and consistent style on a variety of films. The recent documentary film \"Visions of Light\" broadly hinted that some cinematographers also considered themselves worthy of the honor.   Now it appears that the term could be applied to still photographs too, or at least to the field of fashion photography. Not to the photographer -- all photographers are already authors of their own work and studio photographers are usually directors as well, and no one has ever said otherwise -- but to the fashion director. \"Short Stories: Celebrating 25 Years of Vogue Fashion by Grace Coddington\" at the James Danziger Gallery in SoHo pays tribute to a fashion director's influence not just on fashion but on photography. Apparently the first show ever to do so, \"Short Stories\" gives credit to the woman behind the scenes.

If you are older than 7 or 8 you probably did not notice the bird. That means that you did not notice it either 39 pages later when Bartholomew returns, toting a big bag of gold. So why is that bird there? He's there to interest younger, sharper eyes than yours.   The illustrations of picture books are alive with bit players like that bird, or the two cats who romp through the opening chapters of Attilio Mussino's illustrations for the big 1911 edition of \"Pinocchio.\" Although they are not mentioned in the text, such actors often play significant roles. The cats in \"Pinocchio,\" for example, serve as tour guides, especially for nonreaders who follow the story through the pictures. The artist David Small contributes a contemporary cousin of Mussino's cats in Arthur Yorinks's \"Company's Coming.\" The time is 1988, the place is the suburb of Belmore, and while all eyes are riveted on the U.F.O. that has just landed in Moe and Shirley's backyard, a thin white cat sits tensed at the edge of the scene. As the jokes grow and spin off one another, the cat acts out a running commentary. At the sight of two aliens its eyes widen; the hair on its back stands up when the spacemen enter the house; and while all those around the cat are losing their heads at the thought of an alien invasion, it delicately licks up a deviled egg that has dropped from Shirley's hors d'oeuvre tray.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Alice Aragones, Ignacio Vergara","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/style/engagements-alice-aragones-ignacio-vergara.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Jose R.

HOLLYWOOD DOGS and HOLLYWOOD CATS (Collins, each $14.95), two engaging photographic compilations edited by J. C. Suares, salute Tinseltown's hairiest hunks and heavies. Today some of the shots seem like witty parodies of certain stars' images. One publicity still catches Clark Gable on the set of \"Red Dust\" gazing deeply into the eyes of an adoring Irish setter. Another shows a creamy-complexioned Grace Kelly hoisting a kitten up to a bowl of actual cream. These images seem especially stagy when contrasted with the revealing at-home images rounded up by Mr. Suares, whose previous books include \"The Illustrated Cat\" and \"The Literary Dog.\" There is a remarkably intimate portrait of a young Marlon Brando typing moodily with his cat draped around his shoulders. Another unlikely shot captures Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor holding their Lhasa apsos and their Pekingese aboard their yacht, where they lived during a 1971 London stay so their pets would not have to be quarantined. On-screen performances don't get stinted, although fans of Asta will have to settle for one classic checking-out-the-icebox picture from \"After the Thin Man.\" Feline fans will savor the career of Orangey, Audrey Hepburn's irritable tabby co-star in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" who frequently had to be restrained from stalking off the set. Mr. Suares does not aim to be comprehensive.

Strong legislation has been introduced in the City Council. The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, has named a task force to look into regulation of the industry. And the Department of City Planning is preparing a study to document the negative impact of pornography on the quality of neighborhoods -- the essential first step toward what I think is the best long-term answer, citywide zoning.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"A 1990's Road Trip Worthy of Kerouac","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/style/a-1990s-road-trip-worthy-of-kerouac.html","abstract":"IN 1972, when Nick Mahone was 1, his father, a wealthy political consultant, boarded a Los Angeles-bound plane for a campaign fund-raiser.

The ruins of this major Maya city in Honduras, a mere eight miles over the border, seemed a simple excursion from Guatemala City. But getting there is not so simple. Travelers to this important archeological site known for its exquisite monuments face mountainous roads of dirt and rubble for a good part of the trip, red tape at the border crossing and even on paved highways, and lines of decrepit trucks that often slow the pace to 20 miles an hour. The trip is also complicated by the fact that travel after dark is not advised because of the army's taste for randomly stopping and searching vehicles. And if there is rain some roads may be flooded.   The grueling if sometimes scenic 120-mile drive between Guatemala City and Copan requires a minimum of five hours in good weather. Although many guidebooks suggest that one quick day there with no overnight stay is all that is needed, a comfortable expedition to Copan is definitely a two-day affair.

Perhaps then, instead of a mass media event, we could have witnessed a constructive discussion focusing on some of the real issues of international trade:   * The debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement is not a clash between \"free trade\" and \"protectionism.\" Neither of these code terms accurately describes the accord or the positions of most of those who oppose it. These terms just make it harder for people to focus on the agreement's actual provisions and their likely effects.   * Before the North American Free Trade Agreement was negotiated, and whether or not it passes, the strategy of transnational business has been, and will continue to be, to move operations to lower-cost sites. The issue is whether or not we will change our trade policy to discourage that strategy.   * When the European Community countries formed their trading bloc, they made agreements that will raise the wages and standards of the countries at the low end of the scale.   * There is significant opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico (as I learned when I studied there this year) from independent unions, small farmers and community groups. They fear the trade agreement will bring more exploitation of low-paid Mexican workers; increased unemployment of some of the higher-paid workers employed by Mexican companies that cannot compete with higher-tech companies based in the United States; radical changes to the traditional culture of Mexico, and benefits for a very small number of upper- and middle-class Mexicans.   * If this version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is defeated (and I think it should be defeated), trade with Mexico and Latin America will continue.    The real issue, as I see it, is whether or not the people of the United States, Mexico and Canada will demand a trade policy that promotes real development of the Mexican economy and that sets and enforces decent standards of living for workers in North America and throughout the world.

The newspaper said the grand jury was looking into possible connections between a legislative vote on interstate banking in 1989 and bank loans to lawmakers.   What has commenced now is perhaps another chapter from that same textbook: How does a candidate who has professed absolute innocence get beyond what is, for the moment at least, nothing more than an anonymous, if toxic, cloud that somehow leaked from a supposedly confidential jury room?

New York was the cradle of abstract expressionism, a physical and emotional style. In contrast, the West Coast was, and remains, very receptive to drafts of Eastern spirituality. \n\nThe career of Mr. Graves, born in Oregon in 1910 and having spent most of his life in the Pacific Northwest, emblemizes West Coast concerns. Fifty years of his paintings, watercolors and drawings now on view at the New Britain Museum of American Art reveal a deepening involvement with Oriental philosophy. The show, chosen to allow the viewer the opportunity to trace that evolution, ends up being a fine mini-retrospective of a popular artist. It was organized by the Schmidt-Bingham Gallery in Manhattan and is subtitled \"Reconciling Inner and Outer Realities,\" in recognition of Mr. Graves's perennial meditative quest.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Growing Consensus on Covering All, but How?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/growing-consensus-on-covering-all-but-how.html","abstract":"  PRESIDENT CLINTON and Hillary Rodham Clinton have won the first battle of health care, with hardly any notice of how important the victory was.

He is in the Hall of Fame and, like the Giants linebacker, has been called the greatest of all time at his position. In the early 1970's, Butkus's body began to wear down. The ligaments in his right knee were so worn that eventually bone was grating against bone. To make a simple tackle meant the greatest of efforts -- and pain was a constant companion.   As Taylor is doing now, Butkus would often skip practices and just suit up for the games. For a while, he refused to accept the fact that his skills were slipping. There were times Butkus would look at game film and see that he was always a step behind, that instead of making a tackle he was just piling on. Then came a Monday night in 1973 and a nationally televised audience saw Butkus, perhaps football's greatest warrior, limping around the field. It was around then that players began to compare Butkus to a wounded grizzly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Meric Bloch Lauren Brenner, Richard Maybaum","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/style/weddings-meric-bloch-lauren-brenner-richard-maybaum.html","abstract":"  Lauren Kimberly Brenner, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Stephen M.

Its ancestry can be traced back to the Greek phantazein, \"to make visible, present to the mind,\" which is derived from phaos, the Greek word for light, and akin to the Sanskrit bhati, \"it shines.\" Sadly, most books marketed today under the label of fantasy do a disservice to this proud etymology. Instead of fresh wonders made visible, fantasy as a commercial genre has come to mean endlessly recycled adventures of sword-wielding heroes and spell-casting wizards, recounted in a pseudopoetic prose as dreary and predictable as the characters and settings. This makes the achievement of Peter S. Beagle in THE INNKEEPER'S SONG (Roc/Penguin, $20) all the more remarkable. In his capable hands even the most timeworn material shines again.   Mr. Beagle, whose 1968 novel, \"The Last Unicorn,\" is something of a classic in the field, sets his story of love and loss in familiar territory -- a preindustrial world in which the levers of power are manipulated, for good or ill, by people known as wizards or magicians. Three women -- one black, one brown and one paler than a corpse -- take a room in a village inn. Their coming is no accident. Two of the women are former pupils of a magician who is locked in a deadly duel with his greatest protege; the pale woman has been called back from the dead by an act of gratuitous kindness that will have profound consequences.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/nyregion/c-corrections-972793.html","abstract":"  A chart on page 10 of the Travel section today with the What's Doing column, about New York City, refers imprecisely to the 1990 population of the New York metropolitan area.

When he plays the aging Stevens of the 1950's, Mr. Hopkins's shoulders are slightly hunched up and rounded, so full of tension they look painful. In flashbacks to Stevens in his prime during the 1930's, the shoulders are less tense. In those days of Stevens's blind and self-satisfied devotion to his master, Lord Darlington, the butler has a rigid bearing and placid face, though his worried eyes hint at the merciless denial of his emotional life.    The actor's posture is one visual equivalent of the self-deluded and defensive monologue by Stevens that makes up the English writer Kazuo Ishiguro's 1989 novel, on which the film is based. What is \"a great butler,\" Stevens fussily wonders in the novel. Who \"set the standards amongst our generation\"? That sense of a generation whose time and standards have passed is a major theme on the page. Stevens's musing about it is absent from the film, but Mr. Hopkins's punctilious diction and changing posture provide perfect cinematic equals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"POSTINGS: Cobble Hill; Turning a Garage Into a House-Garage That Blends Into a Historic District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/realestate/postings-cobble-hill-turning-garage-into-house-garage-that-blends-into-historic.html","abstract":"  It will be a new three-story, one-family town house in the Cobble Hill Historic District in Brooklyn, and the architect, Joseph G.

But they are also experiments in terror. Every four years, New Yorkers are bombarded with grotesquely magnified images of urban horror. The challenger tries to persuade us that things have never been worse. The incumbent insists that even greater catastrophes lie ahead if he is turned out of office. Though the contest is local, the contestants act out a national drama. Their alternating appeals to hope and fear reverberate throughout urban America.   Four years ago, New Yorkers united behind David Dinkins with the hope that the election of New York's first black mayor could reinvigorate the city's embattled liberal tradition. Architecture, planning and urban design have long been part of that tradition, and many New Yorkers who supported Mr. Dinkins hoped that his administration would revive a place for design in urban affairs. After a decade of explosive real estate development (the anarchic cityscape parodied by Anton Furst's set design for the 1989 film \"Batman\"), people had wearied of the argument that real estate development automatically benefits the city's quality of life.

The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join toether in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the ture cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. THE OVERSEER A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators ofthe quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising questions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. THE PAYERS Employers: Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in thier region, and to support family coverage for married workers. Employee: Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. Self-Employed and Nonworkers: Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. Government: Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. Large Corporations: Would have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. THE BROKERS Health Alliances: The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for services provided outside H.M.O.'s Access: All citizens and legal resident would be covered. Cost: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. Eligible Plans: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. Options: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is overshubscribed. Quality: Allance would publich information to help consumers compare the service and the medical perfomance of various plans. Size: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Structure: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance Corporate Alliances: If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their won alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employees might have fewer providers to choose from. THE OPTIONS Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service options offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,932 a year for an individual and $4,360 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in price; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies, covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O.: The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subsribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay a share of the bill. Combination Plan: The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service: The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family) and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. THE BENEFITS All Americans would be issued a \"health security card\" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Most care for children. Adult preventive benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions Eye & Ear: Routing vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: For terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices, when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents futher deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illness or injury. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not \"medically necessary or appropraite,\" citing cosmetic orthodontia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services. A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected   IF YOUR SITUATION IS... Working, with Good Insurance: Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as theyreceived care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits behond those in the standard package remian tax-free to employee for 10 years. Working, Uninsured: Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive a subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, it family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.) Non-Worker or Unemployed: Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with uneraned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line. Part-Time Worker: Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a prorated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-Employed: Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribtuion toward the employer share - 80 percent of average premium cost - they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax deductible, compared with 25 percent now. Two-Earner Family: In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute toward each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share - 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors. Household Employee: For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Early Retiree: Initially, early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare would have guaranteed access to insurance at community-wide rates. Beginning in 1998, the Government would pay 80 percent of the cost of an average premium for all but the most affluent people. Part-time work or a spouse's earning would alter this subsidy. Medicare Recipient: The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have the option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or are better than current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in their former health plan, paying any differnce between Medicare contribution and plan cost. Medicaid Recipient: Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state government would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment. Student: Students attending school full time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy would sing up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A Portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage. Illegal Immigrant: Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for coverage through the health alliance but could still receive emergency and other care as they do new.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Costa Rica","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/travel/l-costa-rica-678093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: I commend Rebecca Johnson for \"Costa Rica's Rumbling Mountain\" (Oct. 24), presenting what Costa Rica has to offer -- natural phenomena and beauty, combined with community-based tourism.

This book chronicles four days and nights in November 1965, when American soldiers in the central highlands of Vietnam endured what proved to be the bloodiest campaign of the war. It was also an experience that was emblematic of the entire conflict: the United States used new technological weaponry, only to be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers and persistence of the enemy. Written by a retired officer and a journalist who were there, the book reveals \"equal rations of pride and anguish, and it goes as far as any book yet written toward answering the hoary question of what combat is really like,\" Nicholas Proffitt said here last year. Also reissued is THE TRAGEDY OF CAMBODIAN HISTORY: Politics, War, and Revolution Since 1945, by David P.

These children, whom the director of Therapeutic Recreation at the hospital, Steve Balcanoff, described as being \"very distractible, with short attention spans,\" respond strongly to the one-on-one contact they have with an adult during the 90-minute sessions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931114","headline":"Uncool For School","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/style/uncool-for-school.html","abstract":"  Every weekday morning, Jermaine Smith, a boyishly handsome East New York teen-ager, awakens shortly after dawn to the street beats of his alarm clock-radio.

Hostile environment harassment refers to sexual harassment so severe or pervasive as to interfere unreasonably with an individual's work performance or to create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. The harasser is not threatening to block a career, but is exercising a need for power or expressing indifference to the feelings of others about sexuality in the workplace.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931115","headline":"No. 2 Pencil Fades As Graduate Exam Moves to Computer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/15/us/no-2-pencil-fades-as-graduate-exam-moves-to-computer.html","abstract":"  The Educational Testing Service, creators of the examinations that give Americans the jitters -- the S.A.T., G.R.E., P.S.A.T. -- today takes a major step toward eliminating the standardized paper and pencil test with the introduction of a new computerized version of the Graduate Record Examination.

Last winter was abnormally mild, and though fighting continued, few people died of hunger or cold. Things are bleaker this winter; the State Department now estimates that more than 2.7 million lives are at risk due to war, disease, malnutrition or inadequate shelter.    The threat is greatest in central Bosnia, where fighting impedes relief convoys. In Sarajevo, Serbian forces have devised a devilish way to torment besieged inhabitants who rely on natural gas for heat. Gas flowing through a buried pipeline is periodically cut off, despite Belgrade's promises that this would not happen. When United Nations monitors protest, the tap is turned on, at least for a time.

The other team triumph was in amateur play, in the Walker Cup. This one came with something approaching ease. The Americans led after all four rounds, held a three-shot advantage when play started on the final round and won by four strokes over the Zimbabwe team with a 20-under-par total of 556.

Giuliani is choosing a strategy that many cities, from Boston to San Diego, have abandoned as costly and ineffective. Although their experience is by no means universal, many cities found that aggressive arrest policies not only failed to ease the drug problem, police officials and crime experts say, but have also overloaded the courts and jails, often providing little punishment. Instead, cities are balancing arrests and imprisonment with tactics aimed at disrupting drug dealing as well as encouraging addicted, nonviolent dealers to enter treatment. A1. A POWER LIFT TO INVESTIGATIONS Rudolph W. Giuliani said that he would consider measures to make the city's Department of Investigation more independent and aggressive in rooting out corruption. Mr. Giuliani said he would increase the size of the department, as the budget allows, and consider proposing that the department's commissioner serve a term of five years, rather than at the mayor's discretion, making it an appointment like that of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

One was forced into an intersection by a speeding limousine, broke a leg and had to be destroyed.   Without very strong regulation, this industry has little to recommend it. It provides jobs for only a handful of people, and can snarl traffic and sentence horses to years of hard labor among buses, cars, honking horns and noisome exhausts.

As Dora (Frances McDormand), a part-time nurse who lives alone on the edge of a Nebraska highway imagines it, men are born on the planet Pluto, molecularly disassembled and sent directly to Earth by radar. Their troubles arise from having to adapt to an alien ecosystem. An inability to adapt was the reason, she believes, why one of her three former husbands shot himself to death the day after they were married.    A dark comedy of the supernatural tinged with Greek myth, \"The Swan,\" which opened yesterday at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an absorbing 100-minute riff on Dora's theory. Most of all, the play, which suggests a softer, surreal response to Sam Shepard's \"Fool for Love,\" is notable for a tumultuously intense performance by the Swedish actor Peter Stormare.

At least this month.    Produced by Ken Ehrlich (\"Aretha Franklin Duets,\" and many Grammy Awards shows), this show is indeed an unabashed celebration. The first host is introduced as \"a major star of any decade, Miss Olivia Newton-John.\" The final segment, with the Bee Gees, pulses with the kind of lighting tricks that once transported disco dancers to higher realms. The 70's revival push is on, not only in Los Angeles, where night spots like Club 1970 are attracting young crowds, but even on the \"Today\" show, where Katie Couric swooned over the Bee Gees a couple of weeks ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931116","headline":"Choosing Status Quo; Puerto Rico Avoids Radical Change But Now May Be Ignored by Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/16/us/choosing-status-quo-puerto-rico-avoids-radical-change-but-now-may-be-ignored.html","abstract":"  With their ballots, Puerto Ricans on Sunday decided for the moment that they preferred just a few \"enhancements\" in their island's current status as an American commonwealth to the uncertainties of statehood. But with Congress in a belt-tightening and protectionist mood, Puerto Rico's obtaining even limited changes in its relationship with Washington is likely to prove difficult.   By choosing the safe course, in fact, Puerto Rico now runs the risk of being ignored on Capitol Hill. Although President Clinton repeatedly promised to support whatever decision the people reached in Sunday's nonbinding plebiscite, the issue of Puerto Rican status carries many of the same potential risks as the North American Free Trade Agreement, but with few of the potential gains.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931116","headline":"THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Washington Talk; Meanwhile, Red Flags On Health","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/16/us/the-free-trade-accord-washington-talk-meanwhile-red-flags-on-health.html","abstract":"  It is easy to overlook, because the fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement is so all-consuming at the moment, but there are ominous signs of drift in the Administration's health care campaign.
