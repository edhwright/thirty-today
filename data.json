Loping in full stride, the 6-foot-5-inch receiver extended his long arms and magnetically caressed Jack Trudeau's bomb that had traveled 45 yards. Anderson scampered another 35 with the ball for an 80-yard scoring strike.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940822","headline":"New Calendar Brings New Fiscal Accountability to Nassau Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/nyregion/new-calendar-brings-new-fiscal-accountability-to-nassau-politics.html","abstract":"  Nassau County voters will have a stronger say in how much they are taxed and how their tax dollars are spent as the result of a little-noticed change in the county's fiscal calendar.

This year, several new downtown clubs have opened with a view to becoming the musical focal points of the 1990's. The entrepreneurs behind these new spaces have three things in common: vision, dedication and debt.   Mitchell Borden mortgaged his house, rented out rooms and moved his family into his parents' New Jersey home so that he could open a jazz club called Smalls in Greenwich Village; Michael Dorf, with his parents as co-signers on a bank loan that will take him six years to repay, is relocating his avant-garde music club, the Knitting Factory, to a larger building in TriBeCa; Michael Swier took out a home-equity loan and asked his wife to work overtime at her investment-relations firm so he could obtain a 20-year lease on the Mercury Lounge, an East Village rock club, and Tim Nye plans to sink more than $1 million into an East Village club called Sunshine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940823","headline":"Trial to Start Today for Trooper Accused of Fingerprint Faking","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/23/nyregion/trial-to-start-today-for-trooper-accused-of-fingerprint-faking.html","abstract":"  A New York State Police investigator charged with faking fingerprint evidence is to go on trial today in New City, N.Y., in the latest development in a two-year-old evidence-tampering scandal.

Friday's announcement that boat people will be interned at the Guantanamo naval base instead of getting automatic refugee status, as they have for 28 years, is intended to discourage Cubans from fleeing. But the measures made public over the weekend -- tightening the trade embargo, increasing anti-Castro radio propaganda and putting pressure on the United Nations to condemn the Castro regime -- send only one message: \"Cuba is hell; life is unbearable. Get out of there.\" \n\nThus, the harsh new policy toward Cuban refugees did not stem the flow of boat people heading for Florida. On the contrary, since Friday, the Coast Guard has picked up thousands more refugees. For desperate Cubans, the prospect of a bed and a meal at Guantanamo with some hope of making it to the U.S. as a political refugee is more attractive than the prospect of staying on the island with nothing to eat and no hope for change.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940823","headline":"Sports of The Times; Stewart Still In There Pitching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-stewart-still-in-there-pitching.html","abstract":"  WHEN Dave Stewart took off his Toronto Blue Jays uniform for the last time before the strike of 1994 started, he knew more than most major leaguers that Yogi Berra was right.

But one would have been hard put to attach the descriptions to any one piece, for all the works unwound in a gentle, tasteful flow of meticulously rehearsed dance performed by well-trained classical dancers.    The opening work, \"Schubert Adagio,\" was a good introduction to Mr. Mateo's muted style. Slow stretching extensions of the legs did stir the tranquil surface of the piece, but they were the closest things to agitation or near-passion in a dance described as revealing undercurrents of pain and loneliness.

By raising the temperature on Cuba when it should be trying to cool it, the Administration could yet convert a rhetorical emergency into a real one.    The package of pressures the President unveiled on Saturday did include two legitimate spurs to greater freedom in Cuba -- increased radio broadcasts and a new U.N. initiative on human rights. It also included a cutoff of charter flights from the U.S. -- unwise, since Cuban freedom is served by more contacts with Americans, not less.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940824","headline":"When the Car Crashes, Talent Means Nothing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/24/sports/college-basketball-when-the-car-crashes-talent-means-nothing.html","abstract":"  Tchaka Shipp still can't remember the accident.

People who perhaps reluctantly replaced butter and other highly saturated fats with margarine and polyunsaturated vegetable oils were recently advised to eat less margarine and to use more monounsaturated olive and canola oils. Meanwhile, Federal health officials are recommending that all kinds of fats be used sparingly and that grains and other complex carbohydrates form the bulk of a healthful diet.   Now researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine say that all this advice is off base and will not adequately reduce the risk of fat-clogged arteries that lead to heart attacks and strokes. Rather, their preliminary studies indicate, a very low-fat diet may in itself touch off heart disease. They found that a major risk factor was an insufficient intake of two polyunsaturated fatty acids that are as essential to human nutrition as vitamins, minerals and protein.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940824","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/24/nyregion/c-corrections-049840.html","abstract":"  The Key Rates table on the Credit Markets page of Business Day yesterday misstated the prime rate and the discount rate for Friday and Monday in some editions.
