His colleagues, who would be happy to see him go, rallied around him on grounds of academic freedom. He kept his job. The case of Prof. Leonard Jeffries of the City College of New York bears some resemblance to this fiction. \n\nThere are excellent reasons why he should not be chairman of the black studies department -- reasons long available to the college's administrators. Although he served as chairman for 20 years, a review of the standard indexes of academic publications reveals absolutely nothing under his name. Besides, so lengthy a term is peculiar.

Why couldn't Torborg, with basically better material than Riley -- at least on paper -- teach, motivate, boot, abuse, do whatever was necessary to make those overripe adolescents earn their amazing salaries? Those are good questions in New Jock City, now that cross-sports comparisons are mandatory for fandom. With the exception of Patrick Ewing, there are no certified superstars on the Knicks, and even Ewing is not the standard at his position. So if the Knicks beat Chicago, the key will be Coach Riley. Meanwhile, the Mets have Doc Gooden, Bobby Bonilla, Eddie Murray, Howard Johnson, Tony Fernandez, and if they can't even beat Chicago, the key must be Manager Torborg.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"A Key to Flu Virus Infection Is Identified","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/us/a-key-to-flu-virus-infection-is-identified.html","abstract":"  Researchers say they have identified a spring-like mechanism on the surface of flu viruses that plays an important role in the viruses' infection of human cells.

Orpheus's music had, poets tell us, the power to make trees and mountains bow their heads; it could draw iron tears from the Lord of the Underworld. In Philip Glass's new opera, \"Orphee,\" which is receiving its world premiere performances here at the American Repertory Theater until July 10 (and which will also be seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall), Orpheus is turned into a hip French poet. This is fortunate: the music did not have to face the challenge of matching its mythic origins.   The opera is based on Jean Cocteau's 1949 film \"Orphee,\" so it did not have to demonstrate great gifts of poesy either. Cocteau set the film in contemporary France, and he avoided any demonstration of his poet's achievements. The opera libretto, adapted by Mr. Glass and edited by Robert Brustein, the company's artistic director, is just a shortened version of the movie screenplay. The opera reproduces nearly all of Cocteau's surreal alterations to the Greek myth: the motorcyclists who are the agents of Death; the mirrors through which the world of the dead can be entered; the rubber gloves that give passage through these zones; the radio that sputters odd fragments of Morse code and Appolinaire's poetry; the icy Princess who captures the souls of the dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930521","headline":"Judge Dismisses Contempt Case Against Close-Mouthed Lawyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/21/nyregion/judge-dismisses-contempt-case-against-close-mouthed-lawyer.html","abstract":"  A Manhattan judge has thrown out a highly unusual criminal contempt charge against a lawyer who refused to tell a grand jury who had paid her legal fees.

The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have been recommending that Americans age 50 and over get an annual test for hidden blood in stool samples. But there was precious little evidence that it saved many lives. Five trials, enrolling more than 300,000 patients, failed to demonstrate a reduction in mortality.   But last week, in the most definitive study yet, researchers reported that annual testing for hidden blood in the stool could help doctors cut the mortality rate for colorectal cancers by a hefty 33 percent. Applied widely, the test could thus save 20,000 lives from among the 60,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in the U.S. each year.

As both Clint Black and Wynonna Judd, two of country music's biggest stars, demonstrated at Radio City Music Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the music has expanded and modernized its vocabulary over the last decade without losing its soul or its sense of identity.   If most country music still directs itself to white, rural working people, it has also become increasingly suburbanized and has assimilated many of the stylistic elements of old-time rock-and-roll, a genre that has come to seem quaint to a younger, post-punk rock audience. And unlike rock and hip-hop, country music reveres traditional standards of songwriting craft and celebrates polished voices, instrumental virtuosity and ensemble teamwork. If its songs are often formulaic, they are unfailingly and reassuringly tuneful.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/style/chronicle-417393.html","abstract":"  DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR., who still looks like the dashing swashbuckler he played in his movie career despite his 83 years, was cited on Wednesday in San Francisco by CARE, the relief organization, for his naval service in World War II and his post-war efforts in delivering CARE packages to starving war victims.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-91843457153.html","abstract":"1943: Roosevelt's 'Gosh'","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"U.S. Defines Mental Illness As Standard for Treatment","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/us/us-defines-mental-illness-as-standard-for-treatment.html","abstract":"  The Federal Government has officially defined \"serious mental illness\" as it prepares for the first national estimate of the number of people suffering from a condition that keeps them from leading a normal life.

Written in 1965, five years before Mishima's ritual suicide, the play is about the Marquis de Sade \"as seen through women's eyes.\" De Sade never appears on stage, but we hear in grotesque and sometimes glowing detail about the paradoxes of his perversity.   Mishima, who evidently identified with de Sade, paired opposites: the sacred and the profane, the beautiful and the horrific. The greater truth about the character of de Sade is that he is whatever the women and the world want him to be. For one of the women he is a lovable vampire. At the end of the play there is the suggestion that his decadence has not only destroyed women but may also have contributed to the French Revolution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930522","headline":"Byrd Stalks November Ghosts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/22/sports/football-byrd-stalks-november-ghosts.html","abstract":"  As the car entered the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan, heading toward Giants Stadium, Dennis Byrd felt a tinge of excitement and nervousness.

Soliciting public comments, as we have begun to do, is hardly censorious. Indeed, it is democratic. It is a stretch of common sense to imagine that asking for the views of the public will stifle creativity and lead to \"insipid programs that offend no one.\"   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has a special obligation to facilitate strict adherence to balance and objectivity in controversial programming. This is not new. Congress wrote it into law in 1967, when it created the agency. The Public Telecommunications Act of 1992 simply reaffirms one of the pillars of Federal support for public broadcasting as we know it.

As they testified in a trial over whether Dr. Jeffries had been illegally removed from his post as chairman of the university's black studies department, the officials also made it obvious how little scrutiny they had given the department in 20 years.    When the jury sided with Dr. Jeffries, awarding him $400,000 in punitive damages last week, some jurors said the university did not make a convincing case about the shortcomings of Dr. Jeffries and his department. They decided that the only reason he had been removed from his post was to punish him for a speech he delivered in Albany in 1991. The speech caused a widespread outcry because of Dr. Jeffries's contentions, including his comments that Jews and the Mafia conspired to put down blacks in Hollywood films. No Clear Idea of Standards    The jury's verdict suggests a disturbing notion about those whose job it was to oversee Dr. Jeffries's department: that officials did not have a clear idea of what standards to use to judge its work and that of its faculty, and more importantly, they did not care enough to notice how it was changing or developing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"New Jersey Q & A: Miles Lerman;\nMaking a Holocaust Memorial a Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-miles-lerman-making-a-holocaust-memorial-a-reality.html","abstract":"ONE day in 1941, while he was in a Nazi labor camp near Lvov, his Polish birthplace, Miles Lerman witnessed an atrocity that still haunts him more than five decades later.

During the teens, 20's and 30's -- the golden age of the European poster -- a variety of English businesses, even the Government itself, employed some of the finest graphic designers and painters to promote products, services and ideas. This was not the hard sell we have come to expect from advertising agencies today; quite often the works were masterpieces of painterly form and typographic elegance. One corporation, Shell Oil, stood out for its inventiveness. THE SHELL POSTER BOOK (Godine, paper, $19.95), a collection of the company's finest posters from 1920 to 1952, shows that good design was good business. The company's poster tradition can be credited to one employee, Jack Beddington, who, despite lack of experience, was placed in charge of advertising after he complained that the company's promotions were mundane. Under his leadership, Shell's ads were transformed from crass and copy-driven to elegant image-dominated posters with catchy phrases. Styles ranged from the rectilinear Art Moderne renderings depicting speed by Tom Purvis, to modern country landscapes by Graham Sutherland, Paul Nash and Vanessa Bell, to the Surrealist fantasies of E. McKnight Kauffer and Zero (Hans Schleger). There were also frequent experiments with Cubist, Expressionist and cartoon styles by veteran and neophyte artists alike. By the early 50's the quality of the posters had begun to decline, a situation caused as much by the passing of the great artists as by changes in corporate priorities. As slick as later advertising became, however, it does not surpass the individuality and originality of the posters produced when Shell was fueled by art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Putney, Vt.;\nApartments For the Elderly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/realestate/northeast-notebook-putney-vt-apartments-for-the-elderly.html","abstract":"DEVELOPERS in this rural southeastern Vermont town of 2,352 people have created a 28-unit complex, Putney Meadows Elderly Housing, that will serve both the elderly and the handicapped of any age.

Each week they pored over that Hollywood film maker's instruction manual, Weekly Variety (which arrived by ship months after publication), and eventually divined that action films starring Chuck Norris were the keys to success. The aspiring film makers -- 23-year-old Renny Harlin and 22-year-old Marcus Selin -- cooked up an adventure story, had it translated into English and sent the script to someone in America who represented Chuck Norris.   A few weeks later, Mr. Norris wrote back, saying he'd be happy to star in their movie. That was in 1983. The result, \"Born American,\" a cold-war thriller about vacationing Americans who stray across the Finnish-Russian border, was released in 1986 and featured not Mr. Norris but his son Mike. The producer was Mr. Selin, and the director was Mr. Harlin, both of whom had relocated to Hollywood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Coins of the Realm (Hers and Other Folks')","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/style/coins-coins-of-the-realm-hers-and-other-folks.html","abstract":"  WHILE the sun may have finally set on the British Empire, it certainly won't set on the countries that have issued commemorative coins honoring the 40th year of Elizabeth II's reign.

The status is given by market forces and political priorities; the aura of grandeur is the result of a cultural con job. The two approaches have the same effect: everything is seen as mere entertainment.   There is nothing like spending a few days with Beethoven's piano sonatas to clear the mind of such notions. Recently, Carnegie Hall presented the pianist Alfred Brendel, one of the foremost interpreters of Beethoven, in a three-day workshop; he was assisted by the musicologist William Kinderman, whose own musical and intellectual facility was breathtaking.

I discovered this historical treasure some 20 years ago, when my step-daughter, Augusta, was house-sitting for its owner, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. Augusta so relished the ancient charms of her home-on-loan that she shared it with family and friends whenever she was not otherwise committed to opening its Elizabethan Grand Hall to the public. Her living quarters were in the modern part of the house, and most off-season evenings were spent in the two 1730's parlors, so outrageously antique with their broad floorboards, dangerously low-beamed ceilings and oversized hearths in which blazed oversized fires that it was not difficult to be wafted back in time to that era of early New England. \n\nThus, by accident, I became acquainted with one of New England's greater assets: the multimuseumed museum called more often by its acronym S.P.N.E.A. (pronounced spi-NEE-ah by aficionados), than by its cumbersome full name.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Assessing A Father's Ways","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/movies/l-kit-culkin-assessing-a-father-s-ways-224893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Speaking the truth in Hollywood does not always make you popular, particularly when it comes to talking to the press. More often than not you read that a studio executive or someone close to a production \"spoke on the condition of anonymity.\" Because I speak to the press on the record, I expect to be quoted accurately in return. When James Greenberg contacted me about his article on Kit Culkin and his child-star son Macauley Culkin  [ \"A 'Stage Father' Flexes His New Muscles,\" April 25 ] , I told him I wasn't interested in \"Culkin-bashing.\" He assured me that that wasn't the intent of his article. Not!   My quotes were conveniently lopped off halfway through to meet the needs of Mr. Greenberg's article.  Some clarifications follow:   In the article I am quoted as saying, \"Mack has not changed, but Kit has -- absolutely.\" I had gone on to say that as a father and manager Kit has done whatever he feels is necessary to protect his child.   In regard to the notion that \"Mr. Culkin's methods may prove damaging to his son's career,\" I went on to say that he and his wife, Pat, must be doing something right because Mack and his siblings are the same great kids I met six years ago.   While preparing to direct the play \"Sam, I Am,\" I indeed \"recall being at the screaming end of Mr. Culkin's phone calls,\" but both the playwright and I were as disappointed as all the other artists involved when we canceled the production.   Minor points, you say? Yes. The shortened quote under the photograph of Mack may make for a splashy caption, but is no more accurate than the headlines we see in grocery-store tabloids. I thought The New York Times was above this type of journalism.   When the truth is twisted to engage more readers, what's the point in speaking the truth to begin with?

Over the last few months, however, a number of critics, some of whom have H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, have emerged.   February: In the Feb. 15 issue of The New Yorker, David Seidner, the photographer, wrote in the Talk of the Town column about having AIDS and what he thinks about the ribbon.

The crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Without a central Yugoslav government to mediate disputes among Serbs, Croats and Muslims, civil war became virtually inevitable.

It will feature great individual players like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Patrick Ewing. It will feature two teams that are coached superbly and have relentless defenses. And the drama will provide long-lasting memories. The Eastern Conference finals between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls has been anticipated and analyzed. But finally, starting with Game 1 this afternoon at Madison Square Garden, the plot will unfold. Many factors will determine the winner of the four-of-seven-game series. But as the matchup gets under way, here's a look at five areas that will greatly determine which team goes to the championship finals, and which team goes home.    1. THE JORDON FACTOR:    Jordan's greatness goes beyond his ability to score, to defend and to levitate. Jordan has a level of pride and intensity similar to two other great players of his era - Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. The thought of not winning a championship disgusts Jordan. He thinks of the title as his property now, much the way a boxer protects the title belt.

Starting slowly, with plans for one or two events a year, the foundation intends to add more presentations until they become a major community asset. The foundation also hopes that its family concerts will influence younger listeners.   Last year's concert was such a wild success -- with almost as many people turned away as could fit into the auditorium -- that the West Pointers are coming back this afternoon at 3 o'clock. The choice of the United States Military Academy Band is especially apt as Memorial Day approaches: as the senior musical unit of the American Army, the Concert Band has appeared at many historic events (including the return home of the Iran hostages), given joint concerts with the American Symphony and the New York Philharmonic, been conducted by such legendary maestros as Arturo Toscanini and Leopold Stokowski. It should be noted, by the way, that the players are not Academy cadets but top-notch professional musicians who joined the Army expressly to serve as West Point bandsmen and women.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Off to a Good Start: Tending New Arrivals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/gardening-off-to-a-good-start-tending-new-arrivals.html","abstract":"  PLANTING is now in full swing.

Still, the Biennale remains the most beloved of these mastodons of the art world. Whatever disappointment the show might cause, Venice softens the blow; the exhibition is set, irresistibly, in a series of pavilions spread through the city's public gardens, as well as in the nearby Arsenale, which is used to house a selection of works by not-ready-for-prime-time artists that is often the liveliest part of the Biennale.

Oddly tart and sweet at the same time, these anemic-looking yellow limes are a natural for souffles and sorbets. But they are also ideal in marinades and glazes, mustards and salsas -- wherever tangy citrus flavors work, which explains such pan-ethnic innovations as sauteed grouper with Key lime beurre blanc, and seafood salad with a cilantro and Key lime vinaigrette. Some chefs have gone a step further, experimenting with Key lime flavored seasonings, flours and pastas.\n\nThe pale yellow Key lime is smaller, rounder and juicier than its ubiquitous cousin, the oval, green Persian lime found in produce aisles the nation over. Aficionados favorably compare the Key lime's appealing zing with the mouth-puckering sourness of the Persian variety, a larger, hardier hybrid.  The Key lime is a temperamental species given to uneven growth spurts and sporadic fruit bearing, a few reasons commercial growers in Florida have all but thrown in the trowel.

A thousand of the novelist's pals polished off 100 cases of fine Cuban rum (courtesy of Fidel Castro), while dancing till dawn to an even more intoxicating import -- music by a selection of Colombian bands that Mr. Garcia Marquez himself had flown in for the occasion. Until that momentous night, the irrepressible rhythms of Colombia -- porro, cumbia, mapale, vallenato and gaita -- had rarely, if ever, been heard outside of Latin America.   Next Sunday's concert at Madison Square Garden, \"Pa' Colombia con Polito\" (\"To Colombia With Polito\"), which will have as its host the New York radio personality Polito Vega, promises to be another landmark in the history of Colombian music. The debut of important Colombian artists like Grupo Niche, Orquestra Guayacan and Lisandro Meza in New York's largest and most visible concert venue is testimony to the impact that Colombian musicians are making in a Latin music business once dominated by Nuyorican and Puerto Rican salsa.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"Maybe the Sky Isn't His Limit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/sports/pro-basketball-maybe-the-sky-isn-t-his-limit.html","abstract":"  Down on the floor of the Chicago Bulls' suburban practice facility was that familiar lean fellow, star of courts, videos and commercials, shaved head gleaming under the gym lights, legs muscular and veiny as a thoroughbred's, in red shirt and shorts, shooting graceful jump shots left-handed.

That is not a comment I make lightly; neither is it a nod to Jefferson's 250th birthday last month, an event that deserves to be celebrated with honesty rather than hyperbole. It is merely an observation that comes from 25 years of looking at buildings in this country, and realizing how few of them reach the transcendent. Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater? Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building? Louis Kahn's Salk Institute? It is not a long list, and Jefferson's work heads it.   Jefferson's legacy has not always brought great architecture in its wake; it has intimidated more than it has inspired, though one newly completed addition to this campus offers tremendous promise. Surely of all of the truly great pieces of architecture in this country, the University of Virginia is the most American, the one that best embodies our tendency both to look back at other cultures and to try to make something that is entirely our own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930523","headline":"She Doesn't Sing the Blues Anymore","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/23/nyregion/she-doesnt-sing-the-blues-anymore.html","abstract":"WHEN Sun Meidia decided to resume her career as a jazz vocalist after 19 years away from show business, she took a direct approach.
