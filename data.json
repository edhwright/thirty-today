Now, with the Los Angeles Music Center Opera production of \"El Gato Montes\" (\"The Wild Cat\"), which opened here last week, our complacent neglect of the Spanish opera may be in for a revision, too. This zarzuela, written in 1916 by Manuel Penella and, the Los Angeles company says, never before sung in this country in its original language, is dramatic, vigorous and lyrically inventive.   The work has been championed by Placido Domingo, who has been singing in these performances and is artistic consultant to the Los Angeles Opera. The production, which is imported from the Teatro Lirico Nacional la Zarzuela in Madrid, is also part of a conscious effort to attract Hispanic audiences to the opera house. A.T.& T. has given a three-year, $100,000 grant for this purpose, used to support this and future productions. There is even an organization, \"Hispanics for L.A. Opera,\" with Mr. Domingo and his wife, Marta, as honorary chairmen; it numbers 300, though the company estimates are that only about a third are subscribers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940127","headline":"Tough and Smart on Crime?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/27/opinion/tough-and-smart-on-crime.html","abstract":"  In a State of the Union address designed mainly to mobilize support for his universal health insurance proposals, President Clinton was careful not to slight an issue that, the polls tell us, troubles the public even more than health care: crime.

Yeltsin's condemnation of the handling of the Kronstadt revolt is the one you never address. Why did the Russian President choose the eve of the Parliament's opening to drag out and dust off 70-year-old slanders and attacks against the Bolshevik Government led by Lenin and Trotsky?   No doubt it's because Mr. Yeltsin feels the threat of growing resistance to privatization and his plans to place Russia's natural resources at the service of Western capitalism. Antiprivatization forces in combination got a significantly higher percentage of votes in the Dec. 12 elections than Mr. Yelstin's fast-track capitalism. His greatest fear must be that the will of the Russian people will congeal behind forces for a democratized, genuinely socialist course and sweep both him and the ultraright Vladimir V.

He stood by himself in a corner of the rink with a puck on his stick, bouncing it off the blade as if it were a paddle ball. His face revealed a small smile. The Rangers' youngest and most troubled player seemed content.   The night before, he was not happy with himself, and his face showed a frown. Kovalev had no points in the 8-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks that extended the Ranger winning streak to four games. In the last 10 games, Kovalev has no goals, and he has scored just one in his last 13 and three in his last 22. Trade Rumors Abound    Everywhere he turns, Kovalev is confronted with trade rumors, the latest that he might go to Vancouver for Peter Nedved. He turns 21 on Feb. 24 and is in his second season with the Rangers. Kovalev is a former first-round draft choice from Russia who is coveted by many teams that project him as a future star. For a team like the Rangers, best in the league so far and a contender for the Stanley Cup, it is tempting to trade this unripened talent for proven players who can help bring a championship this spring.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940127","headline":"France Bluntly Calls for NATO To Relieve Two Bosnian Towns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/27/world/france-bluntly-calls-for-nato-to-relieve-two-bosnian-towns.html","abstract":"  France said today that the time had come for NATO to carry out its decision to relieve two Bosnian towns encircled by Serbian troops, using force if necessary.

Backed by Ed Schuller on bass and Steve Johns on drums, Mr. Varner did some improvising, breaking up be-bop phrases with long melody notes. He's at the point where lines, complicated but logical, hurtle to their destiny. Mr. Varner took apart the melody of Thelonious Monk's \"Let's Call This,\" playing the theme alone, letting little bulbs of the melody hang glittering, breaking up the tune with silences.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940127","headline":"Article 997200 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/27/arts/article-997200-no-title.html","abstract":"  The Brooklyn Museum has received a pledge of $5 million, the largest single gift in its history.

Its exact borders are frequently debated, but generally it includes art made by patients in mental hospitals, by recluses, naives and visionaries, by rural laborers saying they receive instructions from God, by suddenly creative retirees. In the near future, it may come to include art made by people in prisons. It has its share of true geniuses, like Adolf Wolfli, Martin Ramirez, Henry Darger and Bill Traylor. It has its own history, which stretches back to the late 19th century and regularly intersects with the development of modern art.

A few moments later, the English horn enters with another melody, Arnalta's lullaby from Monteverdi's \"Incoronazione di Poppea,\" which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Schuman. The lullaby is almost jarringly sweet and comforting, hovering in sonic space as the percussion creates a quivering, otherworldly haze.   It is a remarkable moment in a strongly conceived elegy, a composition that, like many of Mr. Rouse's other works, is preoccupied with death and loss. The composer's Trombone Concerto, which was given its world premiere by the New York Philharmonic last year (and which won the Pulitzer Prize), was written in memory of Leonard Bernstein and quotes Bernstein's \"Kaddish\" Symphony. The new work was commissioned by Betty Freeman for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Yo-Yo Ma (who was the soloist in its first performance with the orchestra, conducted by David Zinman); it is partly a response to the deaths of the composers Andrzej Panufnik and Stephen Albert as well as Schuman, and quotes from them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940128","headline":"Guns Gaining on Cars as a Leading U.S. Killer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/28/us/guns-gaining-on-cars-as-a-leading-us-killer.html","abstract":"  If current trends continue, gunshot wounds will take more lives nationwide than automobile accidents by 2003 -- a point already reached in the District of Columbia and six states, including New York, according to a report released today by the Department of Health and Human Services.   \"It is appalling that in the world's strongest and wealthiest country, death by firearms is increasing at the alarming rate these studies find,\" Health Secretary Donna E.

The 41-year-old songwriter has been a local phenomenon in Austin for some time, but his first nationally distributed album, \"Guit With It\" (Curb), was released last year. Mr. Brown sings about a \"hillbilly hula girl\" and about long nights at roadhouses; in one song, he's a singing janitor, while in another he runs into an old flame and reminds her, \"You're wanted by the police and my wife thinks you're dead.\" His voice is a droll, unflappable baritone steeped in Ernest Tubb, Ray Price and Lefty Frizzell. He can yodel, too.    He plays an instrument never seen in country music (or elsewhere) before: the guit-steel, a doublenecked contraption that grafts together a six-stringed guitar and a steel guitar. With it, Mr. Brown answers his own vocal lines or sets forth wryly virtuosic solos. Most country bands have full-time lead guitarists and steel players; Mr. Brown does three jobs at once, four counting the songwriting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940129","headline":"The Rangers Wind Up In Duck Soup","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/sports/hockey-the-rangers-wind-up-in-duck-soup.html","abstract":"  The Rangers three-game West Coast road trip and their five-game winning streak came to an end tonight when they lost by 3-2 to the Mighty Ducks at the Pond.

The ruling reversed a lower court decision.   The woman, Sharon Karibian, who started as a secretary in the university's fund-raising office, said her supervisor, Mark Urban, forced her into a violent sexual relationship, in exchange for which, she said, she received promotions and pay increases.  Mr. Urban conceded that the relationship had existed, but said that it had been consensual.

But the court emphasized that the legal rights of employees are the same, whether or not they accede to sexual advances.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940129","headline":"Behind the Tinted Windows; Life Styles of the Middle Class and Obscure Now Include the Occasional Limousine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/nyregion/behind-tinted-windows-life-styles-middle-class-obscure-now-include-occasional.html","abstract":"  On a Wednesday evening, a stretch limousine glided through the crowded streets of Manhattan, stopping at some of the usual destinations of the rich and famous in New York: Bergdorf Goodman, the Plaza and Tavern on the Green.

Mr. Heymann, a respected legal educator and seasoned criminal law administrator, was challenged to end the department's headless drift. Now faulty \"chemistry\" requires his departure and reopens holes in top management. Coherent leadership still seems far in the future. Ms. Reno's supporters say she found him too dilatory.
