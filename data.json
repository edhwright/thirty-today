Before going there, however, it's best to put aside your notions of New York Thai food.   Vong is to Manhattan's mom-and-pop Thai restaurants what the Carnival cruises are to the Circle Line. Big, bold and stagy, Vong holds no claims to culinary verisimilitude. When was the last time you saw foie gras with mangoes in an Eighth Avenue Thai dining room? \"It's my interpretation of French and Thai,\" says Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef and owner, whose varied background includes two years of cooking in Bangkok. Given his track record -- four stars at Lafayette and three stars at the mobbed Jo Jo -- no wonder Vong is the hottest ticket in town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930226","headline":"State Budgets Mending After Years of Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/us/state-budgets-mending-after-years-of-surgery.html","abstract":"  Finally emerging from the recession, nearly all the states are planning their first budgets in years without big tax increases or deep cuts in programs.   But they are not celebrating their recovery by reducing taxes, as they usually do after a recession, according to a report being published today. Very few states are starting new programs, and most are still reducing spending to cope with the continuing sharp increases in health-care costs and prison populations. Nor are they certain that the gain in tax collections that most of them saw late last year will last.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930226","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/nyregion/c-corrections-887093.html","abstract":"  An article on Tuesday about City Councilwoman Una T.

Long before it was fashionable, the Meat Puppets were promoting a kind of nouveau-hippie youth revolution. Over the course of 12 years and nearly as many releases, this Arizona trio has meandered from hardcore to country to grunge and back again, switching between long, dizzy guitar improvisations and head-banging, hair-shaking metal; the lyrics are odes to a perennial state of pleasant confusion. Tonight and tomorrow night, the Puppets play an acoustic set at 9, which will highlight some of the melodic subtleties of their countryish side; their electric set, at midnight, might come off like a cross between Pearl Jam and the Grateful Dead.

It is first on President Clinton's action list for boosting the economy, and not a moment too soon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930226","headline":"New York Classrooms Looking Bad but Better","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/nyregion/new-york-classrooms-looking-bad-but-better.html","abstract":"  New York City school officials said yesterday that physical conditions in the city's public school classrooms were improving overall but that deterioration in many classrooms \"remains a serious problem.\"   In their latest review of classrooms' walls, ceilings, fixtures and furniture, the officials said inspections of more than 45,000 classrooms in the city's 1,053 public school buildings showed that \"paint and cleanliness conditions have improved\" for the most part.

On the contrary, if we are serious about cleaning up the Everglades, we must give the sugar industry a clear signal that it has to clean up its own mess, and now.   No one disagrees that the sugar industry in South Florida has polluted the water system. Yet in the last few years the industry has failed to clean up its pollution.

Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, won renewed state accreditation today after a contentious public meeting.    By a vote of 7 to 3, the Board of Governors of the State Department of Higher Education re-accredited the university through June 30, 1995.   Terms of accreditation are commonly longer, to a maximum of five years. A Department of Higher Education official said the abbreviated term reflected concern that the school had been taken over by a group that might interfere in academic affairs.   Trustees of the private, 1,400-student university and school officials spoke of the need to maintain the school as a resource in a struggling city. They argued that the group that has taken over the university, the Professors World Peace Academy, is separate from the Unification Church, although it is almost totally financed by the church. Pep Rally Atmosphere    Much of today's meeting at the Greater Hartford Community College had the air of a pep rally as about 250 students, bused in from the university, erupted periodically in applause and whoops of appreciation for advocates of continued accreditation.    \"I'm delighted by this confirmation and the ability to go forward and keep doing what we've been doing for 65 years, to provide education to a broad spectrum of people,\" said Walter Wager, a university spokesman.    University officials said the school has complied with the board's requirements, which call for an independent, self-governing panel to oversee the school's operation. However, the three board members who voted against accreditation said they were concerned that the agreement between the Professors World Peace Academy and the university did not meet state standards.    The board's vice chairman, Marie C. O'Brien, of Bristol, said she had \"serious concerns\" about the future of academic freedom at the university. And Helen B. Wasserman, of Fairfield, another board member, said the agreement between the academy and the university \"is not in keeping with either the spirit or the specific guidelines\" of state law.   The university's previous two-year term of accreditation expired Jan. 31. But its status was extended when the board of governors postponed its decision for a month to study issues related to the running of the university and the role of the Professors World Peace Academy.   If the university had failed to win accreditation, it would have been unable to grant degrees or participate in Federal financial aid programs, and probably would have closed. Re-evaluation Next Year    In re-accrediting the university, the board followed a recommendation by Andrew G. DeRocco, the higher education commissioner. He called for the 29-month period \"to allow time for the university to come into full compliance\" with board standards.   Mark E. Ojakian, an aide to Mr. DeRocco, said the term of the accreditation was \"a little less than normal, but there have been instances when two years has been used.\" Under the commissioner's recommendation, the school's status will be re-evaluated by the board in 1994.   Last year, the Department of Higher Education found that the university did not comply with several of its standards. However, \"Since then, the university has shown affirmative action in addressing the outstanding issues, to include revision of its bylaws to comply\" with board standards of administration, Mr. DeRocco said in his recommendation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930227","headline":"BRIEFCASE: Fidelity Issues a Fund Guide To Aid Newcomers to Market","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/27/your-money/IHT-briefcase-fidelity-issues-a-fund-guide-to-aid-newcomers-to.html","abstract":"Fidelity Investments is offering a free booklet intended to help newcomers to fund ownership make their first purchase.

The police said the blast killed at least five people and injured more than 650 others.  1  TRAPPED INSIDE THE TOWER    Minutes after the explosion, thousands of people in the World Trade Center knew they were in the grip of one of the most dreaded urban nightmares: they were in the city's tallest building and something was very wrong.  1  TRAFFIC SNARLS AND SMOKE    The anxiety that began in lower Manhattan with the explosion grew infectious as the day grew long, generating a restless buzz throughout New York City.

The \"Laws\" recommends that homosexuality, like adultery, fornication and the use of prostitutes, not be engaged in; that if it is engaged in, it be kept private or closeted, and that if it is discovered, it be punished by deprivation of civil rights, a severe penalty.

It incorporates market incentives, but unlike Mr. Hahn's panacea, it avoids delay and is based on proved technology and the ecological needs of the Everglades.

This informative, if hardly infallible, barometer of contemporary art has been part of the scene since 1932; its latest incarnation, which will include 80 artists, will arrive on Thursday.   Over the years, the biennial has undergone major and minor adjustments. For the first decade, the artists invited selected their own works for the show, until it was noticed that instead of choosing their best efforts they sometimes sent pieces that were for sale. Beginning in 1937, the museum held two annuals a year -- painting in the fall, and sculpture and other media in the spring. Not surprisingly, the exhibition became a regular event for many American artists: Georgia O'Keeffe was in 22, Charles Sheeler in 29 and Raphael Soyer, maybe the record-holder, was in 38.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Alternative Magazine Changes With the Times","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/nyregion/alternative-magazine-changes-with-the-times.html","abstract":"  WHAT goes around, comes around.

When he died at the age of 40 in 1938 (at the hands of jealous doctors, his followers believed), he was the country's most prominent healer -- it was even said that he had cured the Mexican President of a serious illness. Since his death his cult has spread, particularly among Mexican-Americans in south Texas; tens of thousands make a pilgrimage to his tomb every year. NINO FIDENCIO: A Heart Thrown Open (Museum of New Mexico Press, $34.95) presents a reverential look at the experiences of his contemporary followers through Dore Gardner's documentary photographs of the pilgrims, and through testimonials from the women who are his mediums. Frequently these women go to Nino Fidencio's shrine (often over the objections of their husbands) seeking to cure themselves or their children of debilitating illnesses after traditional medicine has failed. If they or their children are healed, the women often pay their debt by allowing Nino Fidencio's spirit to take over their bodies so that they may cure others, and by making the arduous pilgrimage to the remote village where he lived. Few who knew Nino Fidencio are still alive, and details about his life are vague and subject to constant revision by his devotees. An essay by the folklorist Kay F. Turner offers some historical and psychological insight into the cult, but more information would have been welcome, not only about Nino Fidencio but about his followers as well. For example, biographical sketches of the people giving testimonials might have made clear that many references to Nino Fidencio are actually about a medium who has taken on his spirit in a trance. However, this book offers a fascinating glimpse into a little-known phenomenon as well as a testament to the power of belief.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Emily Bakemeier, Alain Moureaux","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/style/engagements-emily-bakemeier-alain-moureaux.html","abstract":"  Emily Paviour Bakemeier, a candidate for a Ph.D. in art history at Princeton University, is engaged to be married to Alain Gislain Moureaux, the president of Moureaux Associes, an international investigative company in Paris and in Princeton, N.J.

While Ms. Wade wrote that passengers' personal wheelchairs are \"destined for the cargo compartment sooner or later,\" in actuality people who use manual wheelchairs are most often able to stow them in the aircraft cabin. The Access Act requires airlines to permit the stowing of one folding wheelchair in the cabin closet or other approved storage area. Passengers who board their flight ahead of time may place their wheelchair in the cabin closet with priority over carry-on items from the same airport, and airlines cannot count wheelchairs and other assistive devices toward a passenger's carry-on limit.

Our daughter, Hester, said, \"You're crazy,\" and asked where we kept our wills. The idea was that anyone who had been reading the newspapers should know that Egypt was infested with Islamic fundamentalists bent on terrorizing the $4 billion-a-year tourist trade, as vital an economic lifeline as the Nile itself. Our response to these alarms was a mix of set purpose (to see tombs, temples and monuments we'd known about since the third grade), skepticism (there had only been a scattering of incidents and no evidence that tourists from other countries were staying away) and a rough actuarial calculation that told us that Egypt was a safer bet than Mexico (famous for bus plunges), Milan or Route 6, the murderous highway that runs the length of Cape Cod. As it turned out, the only anxiety-provoking moment in the entire trip came when a camel tried to crush one of us against a wall.\n\nCairo spreads beneath the Lufthansa Airbus like several Chicagos; it's the largest city we have ever seen, home to 11 million souls. One of the first things that catches your attention as you wait to clear passport control is a notice reminding you that if you're caught with drugs you face \"death by hanging.\" We've paid a couple of hundred dollars extra to secure the meeting and transfer services of Misr, Egypt's largest travel agency. This was a good investment, for their Cairo representative, Gamal el Hamid, is wise and availing and knows about vouchers, short-cuts, prices, tips and traps.

Killens, a black film writer, said that the movie industry was \"the most anti-Negro influence in this nation.\" It has filled many minds with pictures of happy blacks having fish fries in a \"Green Pastures\" heaven and Butterfly McQueen as a flustery pickaninny with a weak-tea voice in \"Gone With the Wind.\"   \"Imaging Blacks: African-Americans in American Films\" is a capsule history told through 150 film stills, press kits, posters, lobby cards and clippings at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (135th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, through May 25).

His solos were architectural, with recognizable elements -- a be-bop line, some trills, a stairlike sequence of notes -- adding up to a formidable new style. As aware of the expressionistic avant-garde of the 1960's as he was of the be-boppers who had come before him, Henderson picked ideas from both camps, merging textural extremes with sophisticated harmony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"DANCE;\nTroupe With a Smooth and Breezy Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/nyregion/dance-troupe-with-a-smooth-and-breezy-style.html","abstract":"THERE are no swans on the programs of the American Repertory Ballet Company.

Many more are to be found in public collections, notably those at the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and, in New Jersey, the Newark and State Museums.

His residential architecture beckoned to city dwellers with the promise of a bold adventure in living that could be theirs if they would leave the city behind. For Wright, the city was \"the triumph of the herd instinct,\" \"the great mouth,\" \"the Moloch that knows no god but More.\" His houses offered the hearty independence of life on the prairie, but with all the modern conveniences. As the century unfolded, increasing numbers of Americans responded to his call.

Doctors diagnosed hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, one of the most common and serious heart defects in infants. Catherine's aorta was one-tenth the normal size, meaning oxygenated blood could not get to her body. Her heart had no left ventricle.   Until a decade ago, these otherwise robust-looking infants died within days. But now a few hospitals will operate. The procedure is complex, expensive, high-risk. About 25 percent of the babies survive. For this reason many hospitals avoid the operation -- it pushes up their mortality rates. The procedure involves rerouting the heart's flow of blood, sewing the pulmonary artery to the aorta and getting the right ventricle to do the left's work.

Viewers, of course, do not come equipped with this knowledge. It is explained to them through a chart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"A SENSE OF PLACE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/nyregion/a-sense-of-place.html","abstract":"  LONG before I met the woman who owned it, I knew the power of the black dress.

Their rich overlay of cultural allusions extends from ancient Etruscan pottery to neo-classical German cityscapes; from Napoleon's sarcophagus to the interiors of Russian palaces. While taking a playful view of the past, the artist is also commenting on the recent collapse of communist Europe.   Mr. Lollar, a resident of Yonkers who heads the ceramics department at Columbia University, is represented in the permanent collections of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the American Craft Museum, both in Manhattan. He is better known, however, as a designer of ceramic bas- relief for installation in corporate architecture than as a vessel maker. In this show, his affinity for architecture has converged with his interest in historic presentational objects.   Three years ago, in Prague and Vienna, Mr. Lollar visited major museum collections of commemorative vessels, a genre in which the forms are derived from functional objects but not meant for use. He also visited a hunting lodge in the Grunewald, a wooded park in Berlin, to see a collection of tureens that had been commissioned as gifts for exchange among members of the aristocracy. These encounters with objects from the past directly influenced the eight pieces in the show, the artist said in an interview.   Several are based on the tureen, a deep covered dish for serving soup or stew to a crowd. Although its antecedents were communal bowls used by early humans, in 18th-century Europe the tureen had become a luxury object as well as a tour de force for pottery designers. Mr. Lollar has also used the kylix, a shallow drinking vessel used in ancient Greece, and historic vase forms as points of departure.   Mr. Lollar's complex symmetrical forms, all heroic in scale and standing on bases suggesting pedestals or columns, project the formality of architectural monuments. Yet there is a gutsy playfulness in such details as a series of finials rising to a bronze eagle on the handle of a lid, which seem intricately wrought but retain the memory of clay's pliability. The works are further enlivened with inscriptions executed in spontaneous linear strokes. Frequently depicting specific urban vistas, these images reflect the artist's interest in early 20th-century German woodcuts.   While Mr. Lollar obviously respects history, he freely combines its ingredients for expressive purposes. This exhibition as a whole seems to comment on the persistence of cultural fusion.    This is evident, for example, in \"Schinkel Sarcophagus,\" at 40 inches high the largest, most imposing work and the show's centerpiece. Here, the tapering rectangular walls echo the shape of Napoleon's burial vault, while the image of a plaza etched in sgraffito (a method of scratching through a layer of glaze to reach the color of the clay beneath it) is of a plaza in what was East Berlin. This same scene had been depicted on a 19th-century tureen, a wedding gift for a Dutch prince and a Prussian princess; both Mr. Lollar's piece and the historic tureen, which is in the Campbell Museum in Camden, N.J., are embellished with gold accents. Areas of green glaze that resemble blowups of faux marble surfaces refer to the malachite interiors of Russian palaces. Karl Friedrich Schinkel, for whom the piece is named, was a neo-classical German architect prominent in the 19th century.   Equally complex in cross references, \"Dem Deutschen Volke\" is a boat-shape tureen that commemorates the unification of Berlin. As might be expected, a view of the city appears on one curving wall of the vessel. On the other, however, are surprising images of pyramids and sphinxes. The artist says those recall the European fascination with civilizations brought to light by 19th-century excavations.   Another telescopic view of history is seen in \"Etruscan Vessel,\" in which the form and earthenware surface were inspired by the ancient Etruscan vases that Mr. Lollar saw in an Italian museum. Here, the jolting element is a band of painted silhouettes of figures displaying courtly manners in Baroque European costumes.   Shown side by side, two pieces based on the kylix, a classical Greek predecessor of the chalice, provide a striking contrast in spirit. Despite the fact that the German words within the \"Mozart Kylix\" were from a requiem by the composer, this cup in light earthen tones on a gold pedestal seems lyrical compared with the \"Nicholas II Kylix.\" That work, glazed in heavier-looking blues and greens, commemorates recent disclosures regarding the last czar's death.   Although the experience of viewing Mr. Lollar's work is enriched by tracking down references and reflecting on their relationships, the forms themselves are compelling enough to demand a second look. Charcoal and watercolor drawings of several of the vessels, with collaged photocopies of the buildings represented in clay, add a significant dimension to the show.   The exhibition will continue through April 25. The museum, at 511 Warburton Avenue, is open Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Fridays from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. It is closed Mondays and Tuesdays. The entry fee is $3, $1.50 for children under 12 and people older than 62.

In the 1850's, the King of Madagascar sent musicians to train in Europe so they could return to play Mozart and Rossini. Now Western pop has also become part of the African patrimony.   But the disciplined study of the music of different cultures has been an exclusively Western preoccupation. Rousseau's 1768 Dictionary of Music included examples of Chinese and North American Indian music. Theoretical studies of scales tried to take the systems of other cultures into account. (Scales, said one theorist in 1885, are \"very diverse, very artificial and very capricious.\") And it was in the West that the effort to record and analyze the wide variety of musical systems became a profession, one that was given a name only in 1950: ethnomusicology.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930228","headline":"Turn Up the Amps and Pass the Maalox","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/movies/television-view-turn-up-the-amps-and-pass-the-maalox.html","abstract":"  The camera pans in to find Alistair Cooke wearing tie-dyes on a set recreating the Fillmore East.

Mr. Wheeler teaches art but he prefers to say he teaches life. \n\nAfter the story, the students fanned out toward the easels, which are set up around the perimeter of the room. The easels surround a platform covered with pillows, where two student models were settling into position. The others pinned drawing paper to the easels and, charcoal in hand, began drawing.

The ATF also regulates via licensing the sale, possession, and transportation of firearms, ammunition, and explosives in interstate commerce. Many of the ATF's activities are carried out in conjunction with task forces made up of state and local law enforcement officers, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods. The ATF operates a unique fire research laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, where full-scale mock-ups of criminal arson can be reconstructed.
