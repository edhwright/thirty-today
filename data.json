But in Joao Cesar Monteiro's deadpan comedy \"Recollections of the Yellow House,\" the director himself plays just such a character. Joao de Deus, the Portuguese film maker's cinematic alter ego, is a bumbling, sad-eyed everyman and sometime hack writer of meager resources who exudes disorder.   Joao is one of several eccentric tenants who inhabit a seedy Lisbon rooming house run by the fanatically proper and puritanical Dona Violeta (Manuelade Freiras). In a mordantly funny early scene, Joao complains to his landlady about bedbugs, which may or may not be imaginary. He even chases down one bug and traps it in a container; but it is invisible to the viewer, and when he displays it for Violeta it is also indiscernible. A bedbug rash is not Joao's only ailment. He also has sores in his mouth and an inflamed groin that requires the wearing of an athletic supporter packed with ice cubes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940203","headline":"Fundamentalists Impose Culture on Egypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/world/fundamentalists-impose-culture-on-egypt.html","abstract":"  With their guns and explosives, Muslim militants have destroyed Egypt's tourist industry, scared away investors and halted Egypt's 20-year march toward democracy and economic liberalization.

The admission is disturbing. The Budget Office's estimates of savings from health care reform, through no fault of its own, are guesswork. Yet Mr. Clinton says he is using such guesswork to shape a reform for a generation.    The Budget Office is required to estimate whether proposed budgets satisfy deficit-reduction targets set out in the 1993 budget law. That is never an easy task. When Congress legislates ordinary tax and spending changes -- such as last year's small gasoline tax -- the Budget Office can generate reliable estimates. But when the issue is huge institutional reform, estimating procedures are not reliable. Expenditures from today's health care system provide no useful guide to expenditures under a completely different system.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940203","headline":"Sports of The Times; Is the Case For Harding Open-Shut?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/03/sports/sports-of-the-times-is-the-case-for-harding-open-shut.html","abstract":"  THIS is a true story: In January 1957 there was a terrible murder in Chicago.

The fictional Fishy Waters is an itinerant blues guitarist and singer from the Mississippi Delta. The time is 1959. And Guy Davis, the singer and actor who invented him, plays acoustic guitar and harmonica and sings with a husky, low-keyed intensity. His stories, some taken from the anthology \"American Negro Folktales,\" are interwoven with songs by Mississippi John Hurt, Blind Willie McTell and Robert Johnson, as well as his own originals.

Although most of the virtuosos of Indian music are men, there are significant exceptions. Nanda Banerjee, who was born in Bangladesh and brought up in Calcutta, is renowned for her inspiring performances of North Indian classical vocal music. Her wide-ranging program will include ragas, light classical songs known as thumri and religious poems called bjajans. She will be joined on the tabla by Kinnar Seen, one of India's leading accompanists. The performance is tonight at 8. Tickets are $12. S. H.

In a written message made public today, Representative Major R. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat, bitterly denounced Mr. Farrakhan's movement as a \"hate-mongering fringe group\" that he said was spreading \"dangerous poison\" and must be repudiated.   He also expressed indignation at the notion that the caucus had ever established a formal relationship with the Nation of Islam, as the caucus chairman, Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, said in September.   Mr. Owens said that Mr. Farrakhan had asked for all three meetings with the caucus, and that most members had insisted that the meetings be kept private out of concern that outsiders would misinterpret their purpose. Unhappiness in the Caucus    Mr. Owens's statement is perhaps the strongest attack on Mr. Farrakhan by a member of the black caucus since a debate erupted over a vitriolic attack on whites, Catholics and Jews by a senior aide to Mr. Farrakhan.   It also is the strongest hint so far at unhappiness among some of the caucus's 40 members over the decision by Mr. Mfume to link the group to Mr. Farrakhan's movement.   A spokesman for Mr. Mfume declined to comment on Mr. Owens's remarks, and said the Congressman had decided to say no more about the matter. Mr. Owens could not be reached for comment today, and aides to several other caucus members declined to discuss the statement on the record.   In September, Mr. Mfume had appeared with Mr. Farrakhan at a black caucus legislative seminar and announced what he called a \"sacred covenant\" between the two groups to work on the problems of blacks in America.   But that relationship came under scrutiny in recent days after Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a minister and representative of the Nation of Islam, delivered a ferocious attack on whites and other religions in a speech in November at Kean College in Union, N.J. Speech Termed 'Repugnant'    In the speech Mr. Muhammad called Jews \"bloodsuckers\" of the black nation and said Pope John Paul II is a \"no-good cracker.\" He also called for blacks in South Africa to rise up and kill whites in that country.   On Thursday, under growing pressure to reject the remarks, Mr. Farrakhan said he was demoting Mr. Muhammad and called his speech \"repugnant,\" \"malicious\" and \"mean-spirited.\" But Mr. Farrakhan stopped short of repudiating the speech, saying it included some \"truths.\"   Reaction to Mr. Farrakhan's remarks among prominent black officials has been muted. The Rev. Jesse Jackson issued a statement Thursday commending Mr. Farrakhan for disciplining his aide and called for an end to harsh words on all sides, but did not address the substance of Mr. Farrakhan's remarks.   In a statement today, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said the organization was satisfied with Mr. Farrakhan's actions and was prepared to believe that he \"is neither anti-Semitic nor racist.\" Again, the statement did not address Mr. Farrakhan's remarks.   The organization's executive director, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., said the N.A.A.C.P. now plans to sponsor a meeting of black leaders that Mr. Farrakhan had previously proposed.   Mr. Owens's reaction today was considerably stronger. In his statement, he said the desire of the caucus and other black groups for public unity was \"being exploited by a frustrated, misguided and unproductive fringe crowd.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940205","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/05/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-092665.html","abstract":"  Carolyn and Michael Leonhart Singer and trumpet player Michael's Pub 211 East 55th Street Manhattan","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940205","headline":"L.I.R.R.

The residential rezoning appears headed for approval, as it should be. These sound new rules -- the result of years of work by community groups and the City Planning Commission -- would rectify weaknesses in zoning regulations.   The current zoning allows developers to put up very tall residential buildings in exchange for building public plazas at street level. The idea seemed to make sense: give developers a bonus of more stories for their buildings if they provide some public space. Only it didn't work out that way. The plazas turned into extensions of the apartment towers they surrounded, rather than usable space for the public. Some plazas also created maintenance and safety headaches, encouraging co-op boards to make them even less accessible to the public.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940205","headline":"Timber Accord Destroys Forests","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/05/opinion/l-timber-accord-destroys-forests-092584.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Rich and poor countries of the world, you report Jan. 23, \"have agreed on a draft accord that would put forest preservation on a par with the commercial demands of the global timber industry.\" You lead the reader to believe that this revision of a 1983 agreement protects tropical forests.

Then early this week, Prime Minister John Major and his Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, inexplicably threw a fit. The U.S. Ambassador to Britain was summoned to Downing Street for a harsh lecture, and the British public was treated to the peculiar TV spectacle of a Larry King interview on CNN with Mr. Adams, in which an actor spoke the Sinn Fein leader's responses.    Under British law Mr. Adams can be seen but not heard on television, and instead of challenging this bizarre censorship, CNN cravenly chose to comply. A similar ban in the Irish Republic was allowed to lapse on Jan. 19, and Mr. Adams's voice can now be heard by many Britons with access to Irish radio and TV. If Mr. Major is indeed serious about his Government's new peace initiative on Northern Ireland, he should also be ending censorship and encouraging debate. The British media, however, lack our safeguards for free speech, making them much more vulnerable to politicians' whims. In this case it seems appropriate to ask just what the old lion is afraid of.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940205","headline":"Farmers Eager to Test Drug to Get More Milk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/05/us/farmers-eager-to-test-drug-to-get-more-milk.html","abstract":"  On Jim and Jack Winkel's 1,100-acre dairy farm in this snowy prairie town, milk is produced with the aid of remote sensing devices, computers, advanced telecommunications equipment, automatic milking machines, stainless steel chillers and an array of diagnostic equipment and pharmaceuticals.
