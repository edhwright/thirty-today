A show that begins with a glimpse into the cultural void of postwar Japan gives way to the queasy sensation that the West has also been swallowed up by a nuclear-age vacuum. This is a beautiful show, and it looks terrific in the great big blond galleries Mr. Isozaki has designed with James Stewart Polshek for the Brooklyn Museum's newly renovated West Wing. But a profound malaise lurks beneath the beauty.   Born in 1931 in Oita, Japan, Mr. Isozaki came of age in a country that was not only physically and economically in tatters but had also been torn from its cultural moorings. With its emperor demoted from a god to a figurehead and many of its ancient social customs outlawed by a new constitution, Japan veered toward the condition of a blank cultural slate. It is apt that the country later cornered the market in cameras, tape recorders and VCR's. With its own culture in a state of partial erasure, it is as if Japan had no choice but to fill the vacuum by recording the sights and sounds of the world beyond its borders.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Review/Art; Agleam With Devotional Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/arts/review-art-agleam-with-devotional-fire.html","abstract":"  \"Spanish Polychrome Sculpture (1500-1800) in United States Collections\" is a hidden-away gem of a show.

Berger, was approached about taking over as deputy White House chief of staff, which would have taken him out of the national security arena, but he managed to fight that off.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931217","headline":"Review/Film; Harris As an Aging Macho Man","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/17/movies/review-film-harris-as-an-aging-macho-man.html","abstract":"Two aged pals.

The annual tradition of holiday dancing in the halls of the Park Avenue Plaza with tea and shortbread on Saturday afternoons in December is continuing this year, with music provided by Panama Francis and the Savoy Sultans. The original Sultans were the house band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem when it was known as \"The Home of Happy Feet.\" Although never a member of the Sultans, Mr. Francis absorbed a keen knowledge of their style while he was the drummer in Lucky Millinder's band when it shared the Savoy bandstand with the Sultans in the 1940's. He revived the band in 1979 and since then it has played the rhythmic, swinging music that kept the Lindy Hoppers packing the Savoy dance floor. Tomorrow the band plays from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. and everything is free: the music is sponsored by Chartwell Booksellers and other stores in the arcade; tea is to be provided by Tetley and the shortbread by Walker's. In addition, Mr. Francis will celebrate his 75th birthday on Tuesday. JOHN S. WILSON Jazz Generations    John Pizzarelli Trio, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. The newest jazz club in Greenwich Village opened this week with a group featuring the second generation of Pizzarellis, one of the best known names in jazz of the last 40 years. The guitarist John Pizzarelli follows in the footsteps of his father, Bucky Pizzarelli, who was a big-band guitarist in the 1940's and leader of notable duos and trios since then. John, who plays a custom-made seven-string guitar and also sings, is joined by his brother Martin, who plays bass, and Ray Kennedy on piano. John actually represents the third musical generation in the family -- he was taught by his banjo-playing great-uncles, Peter and Bobby Dominick, who also taught Bucky Pizzarelli. The trio plays tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M.  There is a music charge of $12 and a one-drink minimum at the tables, or a $7 music charge at the bar. J. S. W. By Request, Scott Hamilton    Scott Hamilton Quintet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, (212) 533-7900. The tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton has hit on an unusual way to emphasize his international appeal. Although he is usually thought of as a specialist in Swing Era jazz styles, his latest album, \"East of the Sun,\" reaches out in two world-splitting directions. It is based on requests by Japanese fans in a poll conducted by the Japanese jazz magazine \"Swing Journale\" and it was recorded in England with a group of British musicians. But this weekend he is back with his regular American quintet at Fat Tuesday's: John Bunch, piano; Chris Flory, guitar; John Weber, bass, and Chuck Riggs, drums. Shows tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10 and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $20 music charge and a $10 minimum each night. J. S.

The piece is a distinctive original, fresh and unexpected despite its formulaic scorn for what George Bernard Shaw called \"middle-class morality.\" Its eclecticism is still being imitated and so are its themes.    The problem, though, was the packaging. It was part of a thematic program that went both too far and not far enough.

Mr. Moody and Mr. Johnson, who are performing at the Blue Note through tomorrow, have taken radically different paths to radically different destinations.   Mr. Moody opened his first set on Tuesday night with a blues, and everything he knew seemed to pour out. As with other be-bop saxophonists who have continued to progress -- Sonny Rollins, Johnny Griffin and Benny Golson are the obvious examples -- the language he employs allows for kaleidoscopic improvisations, where quotes, tonal manipulations, practice patterns and old lines converge with everything else he has spent a career learning.

There was the return of Maria Ewing to the company for the first time since 1987, when she withdrew from \"all future engagements\" after a spat with the music director, James Levine.

And then there were Peter Wexler's sets and costumes, which a decade in storage has done nothing to improve.   But apart from all the virtues and flaws, large and small, the return of this opera to the Met was a major event in itself. The Berlioz work looks back to Beethoven in its invocation of massive historical forces, and it anticipates Debussy in its attempts to suspend time.

But it is not only low-income women who will lose if abortion is removed from the plan (or is left up to the individual states or health alliances). As Ms. Quindlen says, health care reform is meant to include people who are without services, not those who have them. But since most private insurance plans include abortion, women who are now assured access will receive inferior coverage if the new system excludes abortion. A new group of women -- not poor, not rich, just getting by -- will join those who must choose childbirth because they have no choice at all.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931218","headline":"Samaranch, Clinton Meet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/18/sports/sports-people-olympics-samaranch-clinton-meet.html","abstract":"  The International Olympic Committee's president, JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH , invited PRESIDENT CLINTON yesterday to officially open the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, as the two met for the first time, in Washington.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931218","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/18/nyregion/c-corrections-710093.html","abstract":"  An article yesterday about competing anniversary demonstrations in South Africa misstated the location of the Battle of Blood River, a Zulu-Afrikaner clash in 1838, in some editions.

What began as a rivulet is now a flood: over the last four years, the company has released 235 CD's, or some 250 hours of music. The names make up a who's who of American jazz, from Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway to Fletcher Henderson and Louis Armstrong. But as important, the label is issuing a slew of CD's by lesser-known artists, filling in the gaps between jazz's great men. With enough money one can collect the complete works of the stride piano giant James P. Johnson or the great early sides of the trumpeter Roy Eldridge or pieces from now forgotten marquee names like Jabbo Smith or Claude Hopkins or Tiny Parham.   To understand the enormous intellectual and esthetic ferment that produced Charlie Parker during the 1930's in Kansas City, for example, one can buy recordings by his former boss Harlan Leonard, whose band, the Rockets, featured arrangements by a young Tadd Dameron. To add another voice to New York City's awesome roaring of talent during the 1930's and 1940's, one can listen to the recordings of Teddy Hill, a saxophonist who went on to fame as the manager of Minton's Playhouse, a be-bop incubator. If some of these names are just out of memory's range, it's because the artists' work isn't readily available in the United States. And that constitutes a sort of disappearance.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"U.S. AGENCIES SPLIT OVER LEGAL TACTICS ON GAY TROOP PLAN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/us/us-agencies-split-over-legal-tactics-on-gay-troop-plan.html","abstract":"  As the Pentagon puts the finishing touches on regulations to carry out President Clinton's policy on homosexuals in the military, the transition from the former policy has caused divisions over legal strategies within the Administration and created new problems for gay troops.

The Patriots are so low under the salary cap they have enough room to buy Christmas presents for everyone in Boston.

He will decide who will leave the Giants and who will stay. In this new era of salary caps and free agency, an era that professional football has never seen before, the general manager takes on an increased role.

It makes for an appropriate introduction to the John Pindyck Miller show, a selection of abstract paintings complemented by sculpture in polished aluminum and rusty or painted steel. They, in turn, provide a sharp contrast with the other exhibition under consideration, which is a sampling of angels on view in New Rochelle.    To the extent that he deals in geometric forms, Mr. Miller can be counted a Constructivist sculptor and a Suprematist painter. But he has little in common with the Russian Constructivists of the 1920's or their colleague Malevich, who produced his \"Black Square\" of 1915 in an attempt to rid painting of its representational ballast. For one thing, the American artist, who has been on the Westchester scene for 25 years and has appeared in Manhattan, most recently at the Maxwell Davidson Gallery, is no purist powered by political ideology. For another, he maintains humorous if oblique relations with figuration.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"The View From: White Plains;\nSalvation Army's Star Program Fulfills Christmas Wishes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/nyregion/the-view-from-white-plains-salvation-armys-star-program-fulfills.html","abstract":"CAPT.

Jack Mitchell, who has photographed Ailey's dance company since 1961, has captured the excitement of an Ailey performance in ALVIN\nAILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER / JACK MITCHELL PHOTOGRAPHS (Donna Martin/Andrews & McMeel, cloth, $29.95; paper, $19.95). Miguel Godreau nearly leaps off the page in the \"Sinner Man\" solo from \"Revelations.\" Exuberance bursts from every line of Elizabeth Roxas's body in \"The Lark Ascending,\" not to mention her expression. There are no tight little smiles in the Ailey repertory. The dancers' warmth is all the more remarkable considering the circumstances in which they often had to work. During the company's first tours, they frequently danced on makeshift floors and didn't know where they were going to spend the night, according to DANCING SPIRIT: An Autobiography (Doubleday, $25), the memoir of Judith Jamison, who became the company's artistic director shortly after Ailey's death in 1989. Written with the poet Howard Kaplan, the book is filled with rare pictures from Ms. Jamison's personal collection. Ms. Jamison was one of Ailey's outstanding dancers, and he took full advantage of her extraordinary body when creating such signature works as \"Cry.\" Although Ms. Jamison lavishes praise on Ailey and her fellow dancers, she offers little insight into the choreographic process. Recounting how Ulysses Dove mercilessly made her rehearse despite the fact that she had four steel pins in her hip, her only comment is, \"He challenges the dancers.\" Frustrating as this kind of circumspection can be -- Ms. Jamison spends all of a paragraph on her own failed marriage -- her book is a refreshing change from the graphic tell-alls that dancers have published in recent years.\nHANNA RUBIN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"The E.M.S.

Schwartz;\nThe Role of Psychiatry in Criminal Cases","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/nyregion/westchester-qa-dr-stewart-i-schwartz-the-role-of-psychiatry-in.html","abstract":"WHETHER it was in the Woody Allen-Mia Farrow custody case or the Menendez brothers murder trial in Los Angeles or the Amy Fisher case, forensic psychiatrists have had their say in court. In these types of cases and others, judges and lawyers turn to experts for psychiatric insights.\n\nSince July, Dr. Stewart I. Schwartz of Eastchester has been learning how to be a forensic psychiatrist at a yearlong program at New York University called Psychiatry and the Law. Dr. Schwartz, a 1987 graduate of the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, completed his residency in psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry at New York Medical College in Valhalla.\n\nAs part of the New York University program, Dr. Schwartz, whose father was a doctor and whose mother went to law school, attends law and medical courses and participates in on-the-job training programs.\n\nHere are excerpts from a recent conversation with him about his training and the forensic psychiatric field in general:\n\n\nQ. How did you get interested in forensic psychiatry?\n\nA. I have always been very, very intrigued by people who are on the other side of the law, the aspect that they are people who the vast amount of time are basically behaving within the confines of our legal system but are now outside of it perhaps due to medical or psychiatric reasons.\n\n\nQ. What kind of proceedings are you involved with in your training?\n\nA. We have four rotations. One is at the Bellevue forensic psychiatric unit, where we are basically responsible for court-mandated-treatment cases that come from the correctional system.\n\nThis includes such things as an \"Article 730\" evaluation, to determine the competency of a defendant to proceed to trial. Several things go into determining whether a person is competent: Does he understand the charge? Does he understand the workings of the court? Can the person work with an attorney? Is there a mental illness that interferes with his understanding of what needs to be done in the court system?\n\nI'm now at the Forensic Psychiatric Clinic at the Criminal Courts in Manhattan, where we again receive referrals from the court system. In this rotation not only are we doing competency hearings but we are also doing pre-plead investigations in adolescent cases. We are giving the court recommendations about what to do if the person should be found guilty.\n\nSometimes sending an adolescent who is guilty to jail is not the best thing for him because he is at a crossroads. What will happen after a two-year jail experience is that more or less he will come out very hardened. There may be an alternative in which psychiatric and developmental needs can be addressed.\n\n\nQ. What are the two other rotations?\n\nA. The third is at the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Institute on Wards Island in Manhattan, where people who have been found incompetent to stand trail are sent for further evaluation along with people who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The last rotation is at Manhattan Psychiatric Center, also on Wards Island, where we again have many treatment cases.\n\n\nQ. How do forensic psychiatrists make a reasoned recommendation as to all those matters you mentioned?\n\nA. You have to be like a detective. A forensic evaluation is very different from normal psychiatric treatment or even a psychiatric evaluation that would take place at a clinic. The big obvious difference is that it is not confidential. It is something that will be shared with the court system, with all the lawyers, with the judge.\n\nAlso, we deal with very specific issues. We may have an opinion as to whether the person should be on different medication or whether the person was manipulated terribly by his environment or that the person should be locked up for a million years. But this is not what we are called upon to evaluate.\n\n\nQ. If you and a colleague evaluate the same person, will you both come to the same conclusion in most cases or is there an element of judgment involved?\n\nA. As objective as it is, it also ends up being subjective. Let me stress that I'm new to this business. In the competency evaluations that I have done I always have worked with another physician. Usually we come up with the same determination as to whether the person is competent to stand trial.\n\nThings tend to get a little bit more diverse with such things as the pre-plead statements in the adolescence cases. Two forensic psychiatrists with different backgrounds can come up with different recommendations.\n\n\nQ. In many cases that have been in the public eye, different psychiatrists offer different expert testimony. The public often comes away thinking that the professionals come up with the report that helps the people who hired them. What do you think?\n\nA. I think that is the public's view. But I think what the public isn't aware of is the number of forensic examinations that are done in which the requesting attorney is not happy with the results and decides not to use any of the forensic findings.\n\nI may sound like an idealist here, but the public has to realize that forensic psychiatrists are bound by ethical and moral standards. We are bound to tell the truth and call it as we clinically see it.\n\nHowever, I know we are viewed as hired guns for the most part. There are probably a few running around, but I don't believe the vast majority of forensic psychiatrists are like that.\n\n\nQ. The public's general impression seems also to be that too many people get off by reason of insanity or incompetency. What do you think?\n\nA. I don't think so. First of all, insanity is a very, very difficult plea to establish. I find that the public does have a real misunderstanding as to what the entire situation is. They think that a person is seen for 45 minutes. They don't understand that a lot of work goes into the forensic evaluation.\n\nNot only do you interview the suspect, you speak to the probation officer, family members, the attorney. You get psychiatric testing done. You look for corroborative evidence about their state of mind. Sometimes a person is competent to stand trial now, but he is saying that six months ago when the alleged offense took place he was completely out of his mind.\n\nAgain, we are detectives. We look to determine what the person was doing then, how he functioned at work, what his personal life was like, et cetera.\n\nFor example, in a hypothetical case, a person is on certain medication that has given him a very bad side effect of depression. He becomes psychotic and thinks that a neighbor is going to kill him unless he kills the neighbor first. So he kills the neighbor. That kind of behavior usually can be substantiated by the family in some way.\n\nThis sort of brings back the one case I think about all the time -- the Jean Harris case, where it was documented that she was receiving a psycho-stimulant written for her by Dr. Herman Tarnower and that the murder took place when she was in the state of acute withdrawal. She claimed she was depressed and she wanted to kill herself and wasn't really thinking clearly. It always amazed me that this was not played up more by the defense.\n\n\nQ. Are there any other general misconceptions that the public has about your field?\n\nA. Yes. As in other areas of medicine, the public asks very sophisticated questions but the public doesn't always understand the answers because they don't have the exposure to it. The public has to understand that there can be extenuating situations that can happen to anyone and the law has to take into consideration the psychiatric state of the defendants.\n\nThat gets interpreted as, \"Oh, just plead insanity and you will get some kind of preferential treatment.\" It really doesn't work that way. If they are found not guilty by reason of insanity, they will be confined to a psychiatric facility, which is no picnic although better than a correctional institution. And you have to remember, final determinations of these cases are made by juries, not by the forensic psychiatrist.\n\nAnother common misconception is that people get away with things by malingering. It is a very difficult thing to keep up false psychiatric illness. I have seen many attempts at it.\n\nIt is very interesting clinically, but it just doesn't ring true. Symptoms come at moments of convenience, for instance, as the return date to court approaches. Otherwise, they have been socializing with their peers and acting totally stable so it is very hard to fake this kind of illness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"Mexico Turns Off Its Quake-Warning System","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/world/mexico-turns-off-its-quake-warning-system.html","abstract":"  With memories seared by the sight of their city collapsing around them eight years ago, people here are edgy about earthquakes.

Take, for example, the four-bedroom Cape Cod that Sandra Nieves bought in Patchogue, L.I., last month. She paid $94,000 for a two-story stucco starter home on a half-acre lot. That's almost 30 percent less that the home's bank-appraised value of $130,000.   \"After we fix it up, it will be worth about $150,000,\" she said.   Ms. Nieves's home was sold below its market value because it was in foreclosure. That means that the previous owner didn't keep up with the payments, and the holder of the delinquent mortgage had taken possession of the property and was selling it to pay off the loan balance.   A decade ago, homes in foreclosure were few and far between. They also carried a stigma of failure and misfortune that, regardless of how low the sale price, often repelled home buyers who weren't speculators or professional real estate investors.   Nowadays, though, home buyers, mirroring a trend found among consumers in other sectors of the economy, are becoming more value conscious. They are often seeking out and even limiting their searches to foreclosures or homes in pre-foreclosure -- when an owner has fallen behind in mortgage payments and is looking to sell a house to recover equity or avert further damage to the owner's credit rating.   Most buyers who wind up buying a home in foreclosure have actively sought out a financially distressed property. In many cases, all they did was ask local real estate brokers to show them only foreclosures, estate sales or homes being sold because of death or divorce.   In some cases, though, buyers have found foreclosure properties by going directly to local banks, which often have large inventories of foreclosed homes, or to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that acts as repository for assets held by failed banks and savings and loan institutions.   Properties that are about to be auctioned at foreclosure sales can also be found by scouring court records, legal notices in newspapers, the real estate classifieds or specialty publications, like Foreclosure Update, a weekly newsletter that prints lists of foreclosed properties in New York's five boroughs. (The newsletter, which can be subscribed to by calling 212-982-4026, costs $260 a year, $160 for six months or $89 for 12 weeks.)   \"The hottest bargains now are in foreclosures,\" said Melissa S. Kollen of Commack, L.I., the owner of Long Island Real Estate Training, a real estate school, and the author of \"Buying Real Estate Foreclosures\" (McGraw-Hill, 1992). \"The only better way to get a home is to inherit it.'    The foreclosure market isn't limited to starter homes, or low-priced houses or less-than-desirable properties, either. Last June, for instance, Ann and Larry Kaplan bought a four-bedroom contemporary home on two acres in the Cos Cob section of Greenwich, Conn., for $515,000. After putting in a $40,000 septic system, installing a water-softening system and repainting the house they now believe it is worth $750,000 to $800,000.   \"This house was such a fantastic deal,\" said Ms. Kaplan.   Not all foreclosure sales offer such significant savings. In fact, most properties are sold for at least 90 percent of their current market value. Buyers, however, might also get a slight reduction in the interest rate on their mortgage or on the amount needed for a down payment, as banks are often eager to unload foreclosed properties.   \"It is a popular way to get a little bit of an edge in price and maybe in financing,\" Theodore J. Doll, the president of Washington Savings Bank in Hoboken, N.J., said.   Those slight savings might not cover the cost of necessary repairs, though. Maintenance on many homes in foreclosure is usually minimal; many have been boarded up for months.   \"We saw foreclosures that were so bad that you wanted to tear them down,\" said Ms. Nieves, who had new carpeting installed in her home after she closed on the sale.   BESIDES the additional costs, buying a home in foreclosure is a complicated procedure and the rules often vary from state to state. \"There is a lot of homework and legwork that has to be done,\" Ms. Kollen said.   Danielle Weitz, who with her husband, Robert, bought a three-bedroom ranch in Franklin Lakes, N.J., last year that had been in foreclosure, strongly recommended hiring a lawyer to help in the process. \"Without an attorney at the sale, you could wind up having more liens against the house than you know about,\" she said. \"You have to do an iron-clad title search.\"   Ms. Weitz paid $160,000 for her home. She also paid $65,000 to pay off a second lien that had been levied against her home and an $8,000 tax lien. The total amount she paid, $233,000, is still below the $299,000 that the former owners had sought. She had even offered the owner $270,000 before the home fell into foreclosure.   The most daunting aspect of Ms. Weitz's purchase, however, was that a 10 percent down payment was required immediately, with the balance due within 10 days. Getting financing on such a time frame is, to say the least, difficult for most home buyers. It was accomplished only because she and her husband, Robert, had recently sold their home but had not yet moved out.   \"The timing was phenomenal,\" she said.   There was also a second bidder on the house the Weitzes bought, indicative of the increased interest in buying foreclosures. \"If there had been no other bidder, we would have paid $123,000 or $125,000, and usually there are no other bidders,\" she said. \"But one other person took us up to $160,000.\"   Ms. Nieves also noted the increased competition. \"We had made a bid on a house in Bay Shore that was in foreclosure, but someone outbid us,\" she said.    Ms. Nieves, who is 25 years old, lives in West Babylon, L.I., but will move into her new home on Jan. 1 with her 18-month-old son, Joseph Anderson, and her fiance, Martin Anderson, a 27-year-old general contractor.    \"There are foreclosures all over the place,\" she said.   In the Northeast, in particular, foreclosures have increased phenomenally in recent years, according to statistics compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade organization in Washington.   In New Jersey, for example, the percentage of mortgages in foreclosure has tripled in the last five years to the highest rate in the nation: 2.42 percent, or one in every 41. In Connecticut, the foreclosure rate has gone up almost eightfold since 1988, to 1.75 percent. In New York, the figure has quadrupled over the same period, to 1.55 percent.   THE high current rate in New Jersey is attributable largely to the length of time it takes in that state to complete the process -- up to two years. By comparison, foreclosures can often be accomplished in less than six months in Connecticut.   Nationally, mortgages that have fallen into foreclosure have increased by about 20 percent in the last three years, to 1.02 percent, as of June 30, according to the Mortgage Bankers of America, which surveys about 40 percent of the mortgages in the nation.   \"I don't see any reason why foreclosures in the New York area would go down as long as the economy remains the way it is,\" said David Breger, a lawyer and vice president of Real Property Publications, the publisher of Foreclosure Update. \"The market for foreclosures is as active as it ever was. My bet is that it will stay the same in '94.\"    Subscriptions to Foreclosure Update cost $260 for a year, $160 for six months or $89 for 12 weeks.   Many of the foreclosures in the Northeast are a direct result of the hundreds of thousands of job losses in the region since 1987, which have helped depress local property values and home equity levels. In some cases, exasperated home owners walk away from a property when their mortgage is larger than the value of the home.   Foreclosures, though, may also be a result of divorces or deaths that have left a spouse unable or unwilling to keep up with mortgage payments.   As an example of the different circumstances that can lead to a foreclosure, the home Ms. Nieves bought in Patchogue was formerly owned by a house painter who went out of business; the home Ms. Weitz bought in Franklin Lakes was previously owned by a dentist involved in a costly divorce, and the home bought by Mrs. Kaplan in Greenwich had been owned by a real estate developer who had pledged his home as collateral for a failed real estate project.   \"We had been looking for three years, and we wanted to live in Greenwich,\" said Ms. Kaplan, 41, an executive recruiter, who along with her husband, Lawrence, 51, an accountant, used to live in nearby Darien. The couple have a 6-year-old daughter, Jacqueline.   \"We were looking for estate sales, divorces or foreclosures,\" she added. \"We lost a house we wanted that was involved in a divorce. We were outbid.\"   Though there is an abundance of foreclosures in the Northeast today, there are also recent signs that, as the real estate market and the economy improve, the number may have peaked.   \"Our foreclosures have declined,\" said Mr. Doll, whose bank had 21 loans in foreclosure in October compared with about 50 at the same time last year. \"We still have a few that were in process back in 1991, but there are less than there had been.\"   Lawrence G. Esmonde, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corporation, also said that his inventory was shrinking. \"The numbers are certainly lower than they were a year ago,\" he said.   Nationally, the R.T.C. took over about 114,000 commercial and residential properties in 1989; it has about 16,000 left. There are currently 128 R.T.C. residential properties for sale in New York and 83 in New Jersey. No figures are available for Connecticut.   \"We not getting any new assets and were are getting rid of what we have pretty quickly,\" Mr. Esmonde said.   The inventory of foreclosed properties is still high, however. Terance P. Beaty, director of special services for William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford, Conn., said that 5 percent -- or 207 -- of his company's real estate sales in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties in the last year had been foreclosures. A decade ago, that figure would have been about 0.5 percent.   \"The Northeast has never seen this level of foreclosures,\" he said. \"The 80's really killed a lot of people. We have about 320 in inventory, and we're getting about 30 more a month, and closing on about 10 of them each month.\"   He said that many of the foreclosed homes were starter homes boughtby first-time buyers, adding that foreclosures frequently resulted not only from job losses but also because of no-income documentation or no-down-payment loans that were common in the 80's.   \"There were a lot of loans made to people who should have never received loans,\" he said.   Mr. Beaty added that he did no see the level of foreclosures declining until late next year. \"And you won't see any appreciation in the rest of the market until the foreclosures get cleared away,\" he said. \"People won't be able to get market prices because the foreclosures pull down the overall market.\"   The downward drag on all home prices because of the foreclosure market is exacerbated by the growing number of people who are learning about and looking for foreclosures. Ms. Nieves, Ms. Kaplan and Ms. Weitz, for example, all shopped specifically for below-market-price properties and were introduced to them by bankers or brokers.   Ms. Kollen, the author of the book on foreclosures, said that a common question buyers asked about the foreclosure market was 'Where are the homes found?' \"   For pre-foreclosures, she suggested scanning the real estate sale ads looking for key phrases like \"owner desperate\" or \"motivated\" or \"anxious to sell.\" There are also lists of homes, called lis pendens, that have legal actions pending against them.   \"CONTACT the owner through a letter or a personal appearance,\" Ms. Kollen said. \"You may have to do it five or six times because a lot of these people are in denial. They can't sell their home and they can't keep the debt. Tell them you are going to pay off their debt. The benefit to them is that they will have no deficiency judgment.\"    \"It is really better to work something like this out without having the house taken back or foreclosed,\" she said. \"And banks are working with delinquent owners as never before. The banks will sometimes accept the deed as payment in full, or consider a buyer who wants to assume the mortgage.\"   Should this tactic fail, Ms. Kollen suggested getting in touch with the bank that holds the mortgage and offering to pay off the debt and assume the mortgage. The bank then may increase the pressure on the delinquent owners.   The best way to find homes that have already fallen into foreclosure is to check the legal ads of newspapers for auctions or ask a local bank or broker about homes that are in foreclosure. Ms. Nieves, Ms. Kaplan and Ms. Weitz all found their homes with the aid of a broker or banker.   Foreclosure policies vary widely among banks and states, but usually the process does not begin until a borrower is at least 90 days behind on mortgage payments. Once the foreclosure process is begun it may take several months before a judgment is reached in court. With a judgment issued, it may take several more months before the home can be seized or sold.   In most states, the property is usually sold at an auction -- either in the courthouse or at the property site. In most cases, the bank or mortgage holder is the only bidder; in essence, it is buying back the property for a nominal processing fee. The mortgage holder will then resell the property, either through a private auction or through brokers, to recoup the money it is owed. If the mortgage holder does not recover all the money, it may still pursue the original owner for the balance, unless the owner has filed for bankruptcy or, in rare cases, has a nonrecourse loan.   Only about one in seven loans that go into foreclosure results in judgments, however. And of those, only about one in seven results in evictions. Most borrowers who are subject to foreclosure sell their homes, especially if they have equity in the properties. If they cannot sell, a not uncommon problem these days, or if they have little or no equity, they often seek revised payment schedules or get stays through legal motions or bankruptcy protection.   But once a property has reached foreclosure, the lender, which is responsible for taxes and maintenance of the property until a new buyer takes over, is often eager to make a deal.   As Mr. Doll, the savings bank president, said: \"We are not in the business of owning properties.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"Where Should the Homeless Sleep?;\nTheir Space Is Ours, Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/opinion/where-should-the-homeless-sleep-their-space-is-ours-too.html","abstract":"A recent ordinance in Santa Monica would have required permits for outdoor meals programs serving more than 35 people.

From the air and even from the highway, it may look like an unrelieved ode to urban gray, but at ground level it is one of the most bustling and international cities in the Far East, and in some ways the most deceiving. The apparent Western air -- the glitzy boutiques in the Ginza, the English-language signs everywhere -- leads many visitors to the quick conclusion that this is a familiar place, albeit one so sprawling that getting around is a bit intimidating. In fact, getting around is a cinch, with an outstanding subway and train system. The hard part is sorting out the two Tokyos -- the caffeine-charged city of all-day business and all-night drinking, and quiet neighborhoods where old men in their yukata robes and geta, or clunky wooden sandals, make their way back home from the public baths.   Most visitors spend their time in the high-tech and Western Tokyo, from the electronics shops of the Akihabara district, stocked with goods that have yet to hit America, to the coffee shops filled with young people who seem to feel equally at home in New York, Honolulu or the Ginza. But it is still worth searching for the tiny enclaves of the second city. That is where the few remaining geisha alight from rickshaws and head for the ryotei, or private restaurants of the wealthy and powerful, and you are left standing in wonder at the hidden life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"Two Bodies Found Inside Burning Car","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/nyregion/two-bodies-found-inside-burning-car.html","abstract":"  Firefighters discovered two bodies yesterday amid the flames of a burning car in a remote area under the New Jersey Turnpike in Elizabeth, N.J., the state police said.

The \"art music\" world, it has increasingly been noted, is dominated by a handful of dead white men, mostly dead white German men. Despite the supposed sophistication of late-20th-century scholars, musicians and listeners, most have, over the years, willingly yielded to a kind of dehumidifier principle of fame, which sucks all the subtle moisture out of history. The famous become ever more famous, because they are relentlessly performed and anthologized, while those just below vanish into the abyss. There are two classes, the canonized and the disappeared, with almost nothing in between.   No phenomenon better illustrates the pleasures and woes of this superhero approach to music than the humble bust on the piano. Composer busts are concrete but at the same time ideal.

Her parents, her brother and even her grandfather are involved in Breanne's success.\n\nHer grandfather, Hickey Smith, drives Breanne to auditions in New York City several times a week and waits in the car while her mother, Denise Smith, dashes upstairs with Breanne and her brother, Connor, 4. They wait with dozens of other cute youngsters until Breanne's name is called for her audition, and then, if she lands the part, her father, Brian Smith, helps her memorize the script. \n\nSome of the reasons for Breanne's success are obvious. She is very outgoing. Small for her age, she can portray a child two years younger, a definite advantage in a profession where wisecracks from the mouths of babes seem in high demand.\n\nAnd she clearly loves to be the center of attention.\n\n\"I'm never afraid -- I like to meet new people,\" Breanne said, then struck a pose she has patented to wow casting directors. \"Daddy says when I go into an interview just use my good looks and make my eyes roll.\"\nOvercoming Tears\n\n She was not always so poised, Mr. Smith said. Early in Breanne's acting career she became scared and cried at a few interviews when directors would take her into a room and ask her some preliminary questions about herself, he said.\n\nDemands are involved in the making of a celebrity. For instance, if there's a tryout, the Smiths must be ready to hop in the car at a moment's notice.\n\n\"You can't make any plans,\" Mrs. Smith said. \"This is a full-time job.\" She spoke in the living room of the family's modest home here, where pictures of the children line the walls, and a piano bought with the proceeds of one of Breanne's commercials takes up much of the room.\n\n\"You also can't be depressed if you don't get chosen,\" Mrs. Smith added. \"I know people who go for a full year and get nothing.\"\n\nThe Smiths postponed their vacation to Wildwood this summer when Breanne got a role in a television commercial for HIP, a health maintenance organization. There are dance, singing and piano lessons for her, and she must often do her homework in the car as she travels to and from auditions.\n\nMr. Smith is a police officer with a second job to make ends meet, but no matter how tired he is, when he comes home he helps his daughter run through lines for the next day's shoot. \n\nBreanne is considered a successful child actress, even though she lands only about five jobs out of some 200 auditions a year. She has been in commercials for Ivory and Shout detergents, Pepsi-Cola and Kix and Alphabet cereals. She played the doctor in a Jell-O Pudding Pops commercial, examining Bill Cosby.\n\nThe family earned a free trip to Orlando, Fla., for Breanne's part in a McDonald's commercial filmed at Disney World. Her squeaky voice has appeared in several radio ads, too. \n\nYet there are turndowns, plenty of them. Breanne said she was very sad when she was turned down for a toothpaste commercial that was to be filmed in Mexico because she would have taken her grandfather along as her escort as his birthday present.\n\nThe money isn't quite rolling in yet.\n\nAs a member of an actors' union, Breanne earns $466 for a day of work. That's not bad for someone almost 8, or almost anyone else, but it's not steady work. Also, 10 percent off the top goes to her agent and 15 percent to her manager. Except for buying the piano, Mr. Smith says he has been investing Breanne's earnings in a mutual fund that has been earmarked for college costs.\nProblems in Earlier Effort\n\n After being burned for hundreds of dollars and no acting jobs by an unscrupulous modeling agency when Breanne was 3, the family signed with the Shirley Grant Management Agency of Teaneck, a children's talent company.\n\n\"I knew right away that Breanne was special, just an adorable child,\" said Shirley Grant, who owns the agency. \"She's so bubbly and can converse with adults in an adult world. She'll go right to the top.\"\n\nMrs. Grant also manages Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on \"The Cosby Show\"; Ashlee Kevitch, who was Francie on television in \"I'll Fly Away,\" and Danny Tamberelli, who plays Little Pete on the Nickelodeon series \"Pete and Pete.\" \n\nWhat impact has Breanne's acting career had on the children at school?\n\n\"Everybody likes it,\" Breanne said. \"Kids say, 'I saw you on TV,' and some older boys asked me for my autograph. My teacher said she thought she recognized me on a commercial for Shout, and I told her it was me but I had dirt all over my face.\"\n\nStill, fame and recognition have not made Breanne universally loved. Some other mothers of aspiring actresses groan when Breanne goes into an audition, Mrs. Smith said, certain that she'll get the part over their daughters. Mrs. Smith said she often reassured them that Breanne would probably be turned down like most other children.\n\n\"You can't make yourself crazy in this business,\" Mrs. Smith said. \"We try to keep our daughter a normal kid, into Brownies and gymnastics and activities like that. We don't want to be too competitive.\" \n\nNow, young Connor Smith has been discovered. As he sat waiting for his older sister to come out of an audition one day recently, the husky little boy was asked to try out for a part in a Federal Express commercial. He got it in the one call. He also got a part, with nine other youngsters, in a child immunization commercial.\n\nConnor was happy to tell about the perks of his job.\n\n\"I got to eat real cake, and I sang 'Happy Birthday' for three hours in that one,\" he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"When Is 'Unique' Truly 'Unique'?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/style/l-when-is-unique-truly-unique-276193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"A Magazine Unbound\" (Dec. 12) reports that issues of Visionaire come in pieces that are \"assembled like an artist's portfolio,\" replete with string closures, anarchic sequencing and bags of confetti.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"No Place for a Black Boy to Swim","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/books/no-place-for-a-black-boy-to-swim.html","abstract":"BILLY \nBy Albert French.\n214 pp. New York: Viking. $19.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"New P.L.O.

Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. The woman of the title was a classmate of the author's in a Jewish school in prewar Berlin. Ultimately, she made a horrific moral compromise: To save her parents and herself, she became a Nazi collaborator. Last year our reviewer, Alexander Stille, called the book a \"powerful and fascinating story.\"  THE ENGLISH PATIENT By Michael Ondaatje. Vintage International, $11. Four people are left in an abandoned Italian villa used as a hospital toward the end of World War II: a thief turned military spy, an emotionally scarred nurse, the Sikh soldier who is her lover, and, finally, a dying pilot burned beyond recognition, who may or may not be the Englishman he claims to be. This novel, winner of Britain's Booker Prize and chosen one of the best books of 1992 by The New York Times Book Review, is \"a tale of many pleasures -- an intensely theatrical tour de force, but grounded in Michael Ondaatje's strong feeling for distant times and places,\" Judith Grossman said here. This feeling is also reflected in Mr. Ondaatje's 1982 memoir, RUNNING IN THE FAMILY (Vintage International, $10), which describes the author's Dutch-Ceylonese ancestry and his return in the 1970's to Sri Lanka, where he was born. One critic said, \"His consciously blurred memory is the artistic triumph of this splendid book.\"  BOOK: A Novel By Robert Grudin. Penguin, $10. Anyone who has ever been associated with academia knows that what is dry and scholarly to others is life and death here. Such is the case at the University of Washagon, where an unfashionably traditional professor is subjected to both intellectual and physical attack. We \"marvel at the cleverness of the author's structural artifice,\" Sven Birkerts said here last year. More satire of university life is to be found in TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS, by Alisa Kwitney (Aaron Asher Books/Harper Perennial, $10), in which female Columbia students with various eating disorders grapple with questions of literature and love. Last year our reviewer, Maxine Chernoff, found it \"a bright and engrossing novel.\"  ARCHITECTURE: The Natural and the Manmade By Vincent Scully. St. Martin's, $24.95. One of the most renowned educators in the field expounds on his favorite subject, surveying the history of human edifices and analyzing the evolving relationship between the landscape and what we build upon it. \"His book throws new light on human attitudes to nature and will make an indelible impression on anyone who cares about architecture,\" Sir Keith Thomas said here in 1991. For those who care specifically about the buildings of the urban Southwest, there is L.A. LOST & FOUND: An Architectural History of Los Angeles, by Sam Hall Kaplan (Crown, $19), in which the author discusses certain forms indigenous to that city. Helped by the work of the book's principal photographer, Julius Shulman, he \"provides a lively, streamlined chronology,\" our reviewer, Julie V. Iovine, said in 1987. Also out in paperback is FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, by Meryle Secrest (Harper Perennial, $15), a biography that is more about the architect's life than his work. Writing in these pages last year, Thomas S. Hines found the author at her best in analyzing the women surrounding Wright: \"Ms. Secrest is so good at interpreting these relationships that her book reads at times like an upscale romance novel.\"  HER MONSTER By Jeff Collignon. Soho, $10. A grossly misshapen man isolates himself in a cabin, where he supports himself by writing fiction. Ultimately, love -- in the form of a young woman who has never seen him but is interested in his plight -- comes knocking. \"The result is a moving and unforgettable first novel,\" Scott Bradfield said here last year.  ANNA: A Daughter's Life By William Loizeaux. Arcade, $9.95. This is a journal about the author's first child, born with a series of congenital defects that ultimately proved fatal. Earlier this year our reviewer, Helen Epstein, said, \"This is honest writing that chooses to risk pathos and embarrassment rather than rewrite reality.\"  MOTOR CITY By Bill Morris. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10. At a Buick plant in the 1950's, the obsessions range from industrial espionage to Elvis. The author has \"a gift for delineating his characters' inner lives,\" Michiko Kakutani said in The New York Times last year.  KWANZAA: An African-American Celebration of Culture and Cooking By Eric V. Copage. Quill/William Morrow, $12. The author, an editor at The New York Times Magazine, describes his discovery of the meaning of this mid-winter, African-influenced festival in his own life, offering up anecdotes and extensive recipes. In 1991 our reviewer, Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor, called the book \"the best celebration of a holiday I've ever read.\"  WOMEN OF THE SILK By Gail Tsukiyama. St. Martin's, $11.95. Before the rise of Communism in China, female workers were subject to other kinds of tyranny. The heroine of this novel, Pei, is one of many who was forced by poverty to toil long hours in a silk factory. Last year our reviewer, Fran Handman, found the book \"straightforward and fast moving, its prose succinct and delicate.\"  SANTIAGO AND THE DRINKING PARTY By Clay Morgan. Penguin, $10. In this novel, the author interprets Latin America's reputation for being a land of the fantastic as a fiction spun by both natives and visitors for their own ends. It is \"an affectionate parody of magical realism,\" Ilan Stavans said here last year.

A visit also provides a welcome change from the steady diet of glitter and gold provided by Rome's monumental Baroque treasures like St. Peter's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"A Viper in the Bosom of Blues?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/books/l-a-viper-in-the-bosom-of-blues-212593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The review of James Lincoln Collier's \"Jazz: The American Theme Song\" (Nov. 21) is yet another example of the impoverished state of criticism that obscures the quality and honor of this art.

There is no doubt whatever about that. And so are Scrooge and Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim. Marley's Ghost is alive, if that's possible for a ghost. They will appear in Historic Speedwell's intimate production of \"A Christmas Carol,\" but there is more to the event than that.   The entire presentation is called \"Dickens in the Parlor,\" and it offers a play within a play. An audience of about 25 will be cast as guests in the home of Charles Dickens, who will greet them at the door after they have followed the lantern-lighted path to his 19th-century mansion.   Dickens family members and friends will guide them to seats next to the fireplace and then join the author in one of his traditional parlor play stagings of his classic Christmas tale. Later, Dickens will invite all to join him in refreshments, including a bowl of smoking bishop, one of his favorite libations, a hot, sweet drink of citrus-flavored port.    This is the third year that the 150-year-old \"Christmas Carol\" has been presented by Historic Speedwell, a nonprofit organization that has restored the seven-acre 19th-century Vail estate and maintains it as a museum. The picturesque setting includes a pond and eight historic buildings.   One is the Vail Mansion, where the play takes place and which was probably built a few years before Dickens's birth in Portsmouth, England, in 1812. Another is a factory where Samuel Morse perfected and first demonstrated his telegraph with the assistance of Alfred Vail in 1838.  Thoroughly Researched    The museum's theatrical production is a thoroughly researched historical demonstration with authentic costumes.   \"The performance is very different than any theater presentation -- this is the way Dickens would do it,\" said Joanne Catlett, the curator of Historic Speedwell. \"We've tried to be true to Charles Dickens's home theatrical productions. He would invite his family and friends to portray characters and, for the 'Christmas Carol,' he would narrate and play one or two spirit roles.\"    The play's director, Joann Walukonis of Victory Gardens, in Morris County, said, \"It's an interesting thing to do.\" Like most of the 18-member troupe, Ms. Walukonis, a computer systems analyst, is a volunteer with community theater experience.    Each cast member has at least two parts to play, she said at a recent rehearsal. Besides their roles in \"A Christmas Carol,\" where some already have two parts, they must also portray members or friends of the Dickens family.   \"It won't be that we'll be presenting the cast when the show starts,\" Ms. Walukonis said. \"When the audience walks in, they'll already be there as part of the household. Each will have to assume a role of a cousin or whatever of Dickens and mix with the guests.\"   Pat Erhardt of Parsippany, an account executive who portrays Dickens and the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Present, said, \"For me, it's a challenge.\" Mr. Erhardt carried Dickens's biography to rehearsal. He said his theatrical challenges started at age 6 when he wrote and acted in a summer camp play and continued through productions at the University of Notre Dame.   As Dickens, he must convince the audience members from the moment they enter the old mansion that they have come to a holiday party at Dickens's home and will be seeing that play about \"the strange conversion of Ebenezer Scrooge.\"    Jim Boskey, a Seton Hall University law professor, plays William Macready, who, as Dickens tells his guests, is a friend of his and a \"thespian of great note.\" Macready, in turn, plays Scrooge in the hourlong one-act play version of the story, which retains all the key elements and almost all of the \"bah humbugs.\"    Jim Rorke of Lake Hiawatha, a licensed practical nurse, is stage manager and also plays a couple of minor roles. \"That's the way it is in community theater,\" he said. Mr. Rorke even became a talent scout, recommending Mark Phelan of Boonton for the important part of Fred, Scrooge's nephew.    Asked for a critique of the performance of 7-year-old Cameron Denning in the role of Tiny Tim, Ms. Walukonis thought for a moment and said: \"He's adorable. He's absolutely adorable. That's my favorite part of directing this show -- the wonderful kids. Cameron is playing Tiny Tim, and his brother Michael is playing Tiny Tim's brother. Last year we had a girl doing Tiny Tim. No boys showed up for the auditions.\"   Aspiring cast members, she said, usually come to auditions with an open mind, ready to take any role, but some are more narrowly focused.    \"I've always wanted to play my role of the Ghost of Marley,\" said Mark Yablonsky of Hopatcong, an employee of the division of motor vehicles. \"I've been preparing for this for the better part of 20 years. When I first saw the Alastair Sim film version of 'A Christmas Carol' as a boy, I was terrified of Marley, but then I began to listen to what he had to say.\"    The performance schedule of \"A Christmas Carol,\" listing shows on Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 2 P.M., concludes this afternoon. Historic Speedwell is at 333 Speedwell Avenue in Morristown.  Reservations are required and may be made by calling (201) 540-0211.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"Richter Still in Record Hunt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/sports/hockey-richter-still-in-record-hunt.html","abstract":"  Statistics never lie, right?

To store a bicycle, residents have to pay a $50 annual fee per bike. I think that the amount charged is ridiculously high. Many bikes only cost $60 or $70.

If the answer is yes, is there any limitation on such a fee? . . . Victor Maltsev, Rego Park, Queens A. According to Morton H. Rosen, A Manhattan lawyer, there is no limitation on charges, unless the bylaws state otherwise, when the service is available to all unit owners on a nondiscriminatory basis. \"It is a voluntary act on the part of the unit owner whether he wishes to store his bike in the condo's facilities,\" he said. Grandfathering A Co-op's Canines  Q. About a decade ago, my Park Slope co-op board of directors banned dogs. Interestingly, this prohibition was done on the noneviction plan; existing dogs could remain but no new canines were welcome.    Is this rule enforceable when it explicitly does not apply to all residents? . . . Lilian Fields, Nyack, N.Y. A. According to Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan lawyer who is president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, the board has an obligation to treat all shareholders equally, but grandfathering in a particular situation, like being allowed to keep a pet, is not a violation of the equal-treatment provision.   Mr. Luxemburg also said that you should also be aware of the city's pet law, which requires the board to act within 90 days of the time it learns that a pet is in the building. Failure to do so endangers its right to enforce the rule. The law, he added, is part of the city's administrative code, and it applies to all rental buildings and co-ops.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"A Question Of Inclusion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/style/l-a-question-of-inclusion-749593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:     I really loved your piece on kids' fashion sense (\"The Clothes Ponies,\" Nov. 28).

Seven years after making his first painting and two years after his New York gallery debut, this former steelworker is the subject of simultaneous museum shows and an accompanying coffee-table catalogue published by Abrams. His big, unforgiving relief-paintings, heavy with found wood, metal, wire and rope but lightened by energetic strokes of color or zaps of spray paint, glower from the walls of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo (through Jan. 2) and the Museum of American Folk Art near Lincoln Center (through Jan. 30).   Dial's paintings are like patches of rough seas in which the faces and figures of living things rise and sink among waves of detritus and color. Their sometimes harsh carnival-like rawness can be both strange and familiar: their swirling colors and brutal topographies can make you think of Jackson Pollock, Julian Schnabel and Anselm Kiefer, as well as Joe Zucker and Red Grooms. A tiger, usually of shag rug painted beyond the point of easy recognition, is the dominant form in many of these paintings: rampant, on the prowl, under attack or merely passing through, it is intended as a symbol of Dial himself, and of black men in general.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931219","headline":"Maplewood Journal;\nDispute on Erecting Gates Caps a Year Many Want to Forget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/19/nyregion/maplewood-journal-dispute-on-erecting-gates-caps-a-year-many-want.html","abstract":"MAPLEWOOD \n\nFOR a short while it was city versus suburb, black versus white, a faceoff over fences that suddenly cast this township as an American Berlin, raising a bitter wall between itself and neighboring Newark.\n\nIn the end, the sudden fury over Maplewood's plan to erect gates on some of its streets and the charges of racism and elitism it raised ended simply in a unanimous vote by the Township Committee.
