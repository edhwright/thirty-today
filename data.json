The land donation by the International Paper Company represents a rare but major environmental breakthrough for New York, whose wilderness preservation program has been all but stymied in recent years by budget shortfalls and voter rejection of a $2 billion environmental bond act in 1990. The tract, along the Raquette River near the village of Tupper Lake, was at the top of virtually every list put together by state officials and environmentalists of areas that should be protected for future generations.

Music from the Viennese Classical period, even the early Romantic, bore the stamp of Haydn.  Earlier in this century, Arnold Schoenberg spread the 12-tone catechism throughout Europe and America. And John Cage, who himself studied briefly with Schoenberg, formed his own topsy-turvy academy in the late 1950's. He taught students and colleagues alike how to be free, and also subtly impressed upon them the importance of self-imposed systems.    On Tuesday night at the Paula Cooper Gallery, 155 Wooster Street in SoHo, the Brooklyn-based S.E.M. Ensemble brilliantly re-created the atmosphere of those years. With the aid of two original participants (Mr. Higgins and Jackson Mac Low), Petr Kotik, the director of S.E.M., followed the letter of the scores without seeming to dryly re-enact them. He restored the past to the extent that it looked like a possible future.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921224","headline":"CHINA SAYS FRANCE MUST CLOSE OFFICE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/24/world/china-says-france-must-close-office.html","abstract":"  China ordered France today to close its consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou, as punishment for the French sale of 60 fighter planes to Taiwan.

But the British Government wouldn't go along and so, in the end, Mr. Bush was right to say no.    Air travel between the U.S. and Europe is swathed in restrictive agreements that prevent strong U.S. carriers from competing head to head with foreign airlines.

Amid the interdisciplinary fireworks, the performances suffered from hasty preparation and sometimes uncertain leadership at the podium: in some cases, Mr. Botstein simply did not give the music its due.   But the music itself cast a very strong spell. \"The Abstract and Geometric Tradition in Music and Painting, 1930-1975\" was the theme; while his visual analogies tended to be glib, Mr. Botstein succeeded in linking some of the finest American compositions of the period, tragically obscure music that makes no concession to the classical marketplace or to passing trends.
