By the time it was revived on Broadway in 1973 with an all-star cast of hissers and scratchers, it had acquired the unmistakable gloss of high camp. Now, the director Anne Bogart has taken the work to a third, perhaps unavoidable level in its life as a pop-culture artifact: She has deconstructed it.   The unorthodox production, which is playing at Hartford Stage through Feb. 5, is frequently surprising, occasionally illuminating and almost never funny. Ms. Bogart claims that \"The Women\" is part of her \"personal search for our American roots\" and reflects her enthusiasm for such popular American entertainments as vaudeville and musical theater. The operative word here is \"personal.\" The director has such an idiosyncratic vision of the script that Luce's contribution seems altogether secondary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940113","headline":"Astronomers Say Hubble Repairs Were Successful","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/13/us/astronomers-say-hubble-repairs-were-successful.html","abstract":"  Repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope have virtually restored its full vision, astronomers say, and the earth-orbiting spacecraft will soon be ready to undertake one of its most ambitious objectives: the search for black holes.

Bill Koch, the only American ever to win an Olympic cross-country medal, fell short in trying to earn his fifth Olympic trip in the men's 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) race.

The leading boat in the Maxi class, New Zealand Endeavor, was 77 miles off the lead as the fleet sailed off the southern coast of Australia.

The Webern piece, brief as it is, even seemed to affect memories of the preceding night, when Parnassus, another of the city's neo-modernist groups, presented recent compositions at Columbia University's Miller Theater.    Webern must now be considered an old master, and this early piece, written in 1909, is not so ethereal and stringent as his later works. But the issues Webern faced throughout his life remained the same: how to create new compositional systems and sounds out of the wreckage of a long tradition. These issues persist in many of the programs presented by these performing groups, which have taken their stand in the modernist esthetic that Webern helped codify. In fact, the quartet's idiosyncratic phrasing, its skittish energy, its internal coherence and replicating and transforming gestures seemed to anticipate the ambitions of most of the other works on these programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940113","headline":"O'Brien Hurt in Fall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/13/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-o-brien-hurt-in-fall.html","abstract":"  DAN O'BRIEN, the world champion and world-record holder in the decathlon, cut three fingers on his right hand and needed 10 stitches to close the wounds when he slipped on ice and fell outside his home in Moscow, Idaho.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940113","headline":"I.B.M.

A saxophonist and flutist, he came of age under the dark shadows of both rock-and-roll and the avant-garde, and he's a member of a middle-aged, lost generation in jazz. He's had time to think about his playing, and he's become one of the more powerful alto saxophonists working. Blue Note Records has recently signed him to a recording contract, which augers well for other musicians who are neither child prodigies nor octogenarians.   His power comes from his sound, which projects and carries the heft of a thick lead pipe. And he's an athletic improviser; he plays long breathless phrases, where the notes all join together like a drawn and smudged line. There is no space between notes, and Mr. Fortune, with his onslaught, can create a claustrophobic atmosphere, jammed and busy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940113","time":"1994-01-13

And the scariest of all, whether in the news or in the forefront of popular culture, are suddenly high-powered career types with a yen to humiliate men. The motivating force in \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" the season's most popular film, is a woman who kicks her husband out for no good reason, and whose crisp professionalism is presented as her worst character flaw. Meanwhile, back at the bookstore, Michael Crichton's latest movie-on-paper is \"Disclosure\" (Alfred A.

But Tom Sanders is suspicious, as well he should be: Meredith forces a drink on him, then arranges for her assistant (also a woman) to deliver a package of condoms and lock the door to Meredith's office. If Senator Bob Packwood were accused of this particular behavior it might sound embarrassingly clumsy, but Mr. Crichton presents Meredith as a serious threat to Tom's well-being. \"She moved toward him in a steady, confident way, almost stalking,\" he writes in another scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Senator Accuses School Agency of Shoddy Repairs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/nyregion/senator-accuses-school-agency-of-shoddy-repairs.html","abstract":"  Standing outside a Manhattan high school damaged by leaks, the chairman of the State Senate's Investigations Committee accused the School Construction Authority of shoddy repair work at dozens of public schools across New York City.

The possibilities are (1) that France has violated the European Charter on extradition to secure a market in Iran for its high-tech exports; (2) that it has yielded to Iranian threats of terrorism, and (3) that the Balladur Government, with an ear to anti-immigrant sentiment, places less value on human life if the victim is a non-European, like the Iranian dissident who was slain in Geneva.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"CLINTON IN EUROPE: Reporter's Notebook; President Finds Muscovites Warm but a Bit Preoccupied","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/world/clinton-europe-reporter-s-notebook-president-finds-muscovites-warm-but-bit.html","abstract":"  For most Russian politicians, the Clinton visit was a pleasant but not particularly relevant event during a week in which the new Russian Parliament was setting the stage for new battles with a new set of players elected just a month ago.   \"It would have been better if he had put it off for two months,\" said the former Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil Popov, \"until things here had had a chance to sort themselves out.\" Vadim V.

And looking at his sculptures and paintings in the show titled \"A Tribute to David Hare\" at the New York Studio School, one begins to see why. They are the work of an intelligent, purposeful, highly literate artist, but one who somehow got left behind in time, frozen in a style that many of his colleagues moved beyond.   Originally a photographer, Hare began making figurative sculpture in the early 1940's when European Surrealist art struck him with the force of a revelation. This watershed moment, however, coincided with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, a movement that established painting as the privileged international medium. (Hare himself didn't start to paint until the late 50's.) It also came at a time when many of his most adventurous New York colleagues were taking the plunge into pure abstraction. Hare didn't follow their lead. His devotion to Surrealism -- with its psychological preoccupations and its interest in fantasy and myth -- was complete, and would remain so for the rest of his life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Inside Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/arts/inside-art.html","abstract":"  Not Heat, but Humidity    Frank Lloyd Wright took his time designing and building the Solomon R.

The decline in market values means a decline in the assessed value on which the city bases its tax bills, compounding the difficulties facing Mayor Rudolph W.

Jim Florio did the right thing, and that is why his time is up. Christine Todd Whitman succeeds him as New Jersey's chief executive on Tuesday, in large part because of the huge hike in taxes enacted in his first 100 days.

It set off a tax revolt that propelled the Republicans in 1992 to control of the Legislature, and now Mrs. Whitman to the governor's mansion.   If Jim Florio failed on that count, he succeeded on gun control. In the same burst of activity that saw reluctant Democratic legislators approve his tax bill, he put through a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. New Jersey was first to do so; Governor Florio dared take on the powerful lobbyists of the National Rifle Association. Indeed, he beat them twice, on the original legislation in 1991 and again last year when he stood down the now-Republican Legislature's attempt at repeal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940115","headline":"49ers Edgy and Tense, With Good Reason","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/15/sports/on-pro-football-49ers-edgy-and-tense-with-good-reason.html","abstract":"  The San Francisco 49ers are edgy.

Hermetic and discontinuous, the dances were not the most welcoming of artistic efforts. But they are hard to dismiss or to forget.   In the first piece, \"Heaven and Earth,\" Ms. Miller resembled a rapt worshiper caught up in a private vision of the Lord. A kind of meditative speaking-in-tongues for the whole body, the solo gained much from its set, Caroline Beasley-Baker's high free-standing portal and curtain in rich tones of purple and black. Ellen Fullman contributed an excruciating buzz saw drone of an electronic score, laced with slivers of religious music by Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys. Ms. Miller's fatigues, the color and texture of a dried leaf, were the intriguing work of the costume designer Yafemi.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940115","headline":"New York City's Taxes Drive the Tourists Away","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/15/opinion/l-new-york-city-s-taxes-drive-the-tourists-away-884979.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The New York tourist industry is keeping its fingers crossed that Gov.
