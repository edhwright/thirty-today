One starts with a firm belief that \"La Boheme\" is the best of Puccini's operas, and not just for its melodious imagination and grasp of melodrama, but also for the endlessly skillful ways with which a composer causes his characters to deal with one another.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931101","headline":"Stacy L.

Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani have crisscrossed the city seeking support for their electoral bids, countless words have been uttered on issues ranging from the safety of the city to the temperament of each other's opponent. Here are some of the more memorable comments. DINKINS  Crime We've hired 9,000 cops since I've been Mayor, for a net of 5,700, pretty close to 6,000 and more coming. And crime is down in the seven major F.B.I. index categories for the first time in 36 years, and for more than two consecutive years. Down in the major areas. Giuliani says, well, crime is not really down, they're just not arresting as many people. Well, you know, you've got less crime, there are fewer things for which people ought to be arrested, that makes sense. nd moreover, among the categories is homicide. Where do you think they are hiding the bodies? He says they are not down, so they are hiding the bodies somewhere, I guess. Nonsense, crime is down. Speech, Bethel A.M.E. Church, Harlem, Oct. 10 Race Whether we like it or not, race is the silent visitor. Race should never be a subject of political debate. But race relations, if our city is to reign pre-eminent, must be spoken about -- without fear, and without rancor. Let me say, as clearly as I can, that I believe race relations can be an appropriate issue for a political campaign. To pretend that people in our city don't discuss it is silly. But our politicians must discuss it as sensibly as most of our people do -- in their daily lives, and in their daily dealings, in the most diverse city in the world. If you want to play the race card, then you should deal the whole deck. Lay out your plan on how to improve race relations in our city.    Race relations can be an appropriate issue ... but only if you want to craft solutions, and not catalogue complaints. If we use the issue appropriately, we can transform it from the cancer of our society into the cure. Speech at fund-raising event, Oct. 14 Police Rudolph Giuliani ... opposes laws that would require New York City police officers to live in our city. But  [ suburban ]  legislators, you see, they like the fact that they and their constituencies are safer, because our cops live around the corner from them with money we pay for, with salaries we pay. Rudolph Giuliani thinks that's OK. Bethel A.M.E. Church, Harlem, Oct. 10 Jobs We have not only the vision, but the plan for new jobs in our city. And let me tell you: those who say we should give up, or give in, or turn back are talking about one job -- in City Hall.... I'm talking about creating 110,000 jobs all across the city.... It's time for people to decide who has the experience, the vision, and the values to make this $32 billion corporation work for all New Yorkers.  Policy speech, Sept. 21 Schools The Board of Education is responsible to no one. Not to the Mayor and certainly not to you.... I envision a system in which decisions are made not by a central board which couldn't recognize and asbestos cloud literally hanging over its head, but by parents and teachers and principals in a new set of school councils. Policy speech, Sept. 13 Neighborhoods Those who bemoan the death of the old neighborhood ... reject the economics of upward mobility for all New Yorkers. They fail to understand, or refuse to understand, that the old neighborhood is alive and well in our city, that little has changed in our New York neighborhoods except the faces, the names, and the languages spoken. The same decent values of hard work and accomplishment and service to city and nation still exist.... A Republican candidate who doesn't understand what our neighborhoods were about yesterday or what they are about today has little chance of understanding what they will be about tomorrow.  Policy Speech, Sept. 13 Social Services My friends, this election is much more than a choice among candidates. It's a test of our values.... He wants to evict the homeless on the 91st day. We believe that there is no deadline on a city's decency. He wants to sell off public hospitals to the highest bidder, even if millions of working people have to go without health care. We believe that no one should go without health care, and that principle is not for sale. Speech to Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Oct. 28 About the Other Guy I think it's necessary for you and the rest of the media to realize that Rudolph Giuliani has been under the candidate protection program. For the past four years, he's done nothing, absolutely nothing! Rudolph Giuliani says I want to be dictator. But when you, sir, and others challenge him on questions like that, and his ridiculous responses are put forth, then run your poll and see what the people think! Speech to Crains New York Business/New York Chamber of Commerce Forum, July 15 GIULIANI CRIME  \"Has Mayor Dinkins worried about your concerns? And has he worried about the damage that he is doing by failing to arrest street-level drug dealers? He looks at statistics and he thinks that the city is safe. Well, get out of your limousine and walk the streets of this city! We are not going to stand by while we watch the drug dealers take over our communities more and more each year. We don't have miracles. We don't have a magic wand that we can wave and all of a sudden the drug problem is gone. But we aren't going to surrender to the drug dealers the way this administration has by failing to arrest the drug dealers. Town Hall meeting in Jackson Heights, Oct. 11 RACE \"The question is that I'm guilty, that I'm guilty of raising the race issue by putting on two commercials that point out the way in which David Dinkins is stirring the issue... And Dinkins didn't do it because Dinkins didn't call me a fascist. Instead he stood there with three or four ministers who had just endorsed him for mayor, who had sat inside City Hall with him... planning the endorsement.... They said that my supporters were fascist. They then went on to elaborate that I was surrounded with people like Hitler, Mussolini and Franco.... I don't regard associations of my people that support me as fascists as a light matter.... So excuse me if I have the sense that because they can't do the Mafia thing on me because it would be ludicrous, because I put two to three hundred of them in prison, they do the fascist thing on me. Breakfast meeting with Upper West Side Groups, Oct. 7 Police We will begin the process that I will begin to unfold in the three or four years that I will be Mayor of giving the police a clear understanding of why they are there. They are there to prevent crime. When they take reasonable steps, the Mayor of New York will support them and that will create a less brutal, more honest and less corrupt police department. Because the thing that creates corruption more than anything else is the devastated morale in an organization. Corruption is the tone you set at the top.  Policy Speech, Sept. 9 JOBS Once, New York City was the undisputed business capital of the nation and the world. The sound of our commerce circled the globe. But if you listen closely today, what you hear is an ominous silence. In the last four years, the city has lost nearly 400,000 jobs.... I'm not listening to anybody who tells me that we have no control over the national economy, and, therefore, no control of the nation economy's impact on the city... It really comes down to one word, and a powerful word at that. The word is management.  Policy speech, Aug. 10 SCHOOLS I can't imagine that any parents in the city are resting any easier today knowing that Norman Steisel, the same person who seemed not to know what he was doing in handling Lockheed, is now in charge of asbestos removal in the schools. And with this cloud hanging over Norman Steisel's head I would imagine the Mayor is going to have to remove him for a time during the asbestos removal and put someone else there until these questions are cleared up. Curtis and Lisa Sliwa Show, WABC-Radio, Aug. 19 NEIGHBORHOODS New York City is becoming or already is the dirtiest city in America. I hear it over and over and over again.... How can your city be so dirty. I don't pretend it isn't true, though the current administration pretends it isn't true. I say, lets clean up New York City instead of making stupid political excuses. Let's clean our city up! Policy speech, Sept. 9 Social Services New York City stands alone in the expansiveness of its homeless policies. Were these policies effective the city's efforts could be applauded, but essentially they have proved to be useless and self defeating. In short the policies are bankrupt and are in need of major rethinking and overhaul.  Position paper, Sept. 17 Obout the Other Guy Nobody is suggesting that he is responsible for the asbestos in the schools. Would we suggest that David Dinkins is responsible for anything? Nobody is suggesting that he is responsible for it. Yes, it started under Ed Koch. But, hey, you've been Mayor for three and a half years, David! Do you think you could have found out about it? In less than three and a half years do you think you could have appointed somebody to the School Construction Authority? Do you think could have found out about the Korean boycott in less than six months? Or how come you were the only person in this city that didn't know that a riot was going on for four days? Give us a break!

After Karpov overcame his initial surprise, he and his analysis team found sharp methods of dealing with it.

Its impetus is the centennial of the opening of the Art Institute's sprawling Michigan Avenue home, an 1893 Beaux-Arts structure designed by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge that has since sprouted numerous wings.    Despite a few striking groupings of works and at least one completely startling moment -- Seurat's Pointillist masterpiece \"Sunday on the Grande Jatte\" isolated in a darkened room like a jewel in a velvet box -- the show tends to resemble a fragmented, elaborately packaged outline.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931102","headline":"Man Tied to 175 Robberies Gets 30 Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/us/man-tied-to-175-robberies-gets-30-years.html","abstract":"  A Los Angeles street gangster who prosecutors say robbed more banks than anyone else in the annals of American crime was sentenced to 30 years in Federal prison today.

Brightly drawn, vividly orchestrated, with little teases of electronic sound, this is a high-speed, high-altitude race that works very hard not to be ignored.

The Secretary's politically clumsy presentation of the figures without fully explaining them did not serve either the President's, or the public's, interest very well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931103","headline":"Defendant in Beating Case Loses Bid to Lower Bail","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/us/defendant-in-beating-case-loses-bid-to-lower-bail.html","abstract":"  Calling him \"a danger to the community,\" a judge refused today to lower bail for Damian M.

Olivier Nadal, a co-owner of his family's import and export business, one of the largest in Haiti, said his volume had decreased so much that unless gasoline was available soon, he would have to close his doors, throwing more than 600 employes out of work. As a result of the embargo, foreign pharmaceutical companies have refused to sell him goods for fear that they may not be able to get paid. Furthermore, Mr. Nadal said, his agricultural products are rotting in the countryside because of a lack of gasoline to transport them to Port-au-Prince, the capital.

freed from jail under house arrest after hours of interrogation.    Mr. De Benedetti's brief incarceration at Regina Coeli jail in Rome made him the highest-ranking private business figure to enter prison in the 20-month-old scandal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931103","headline":"SENATE, BY 94 TO 6, VOTES TO SUBPOENA PACKWOOD DIARIES","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/us/senate-by-94-to-6-votes-to-subpoena-packwood-diaries.html","abstract":"  The Senate voted overwhelmingly tonight to compel Senator Bob Packwood to turn over 3,000 pages of private diaries for an ethics investigation, ending with ill-concealed disgust an extraordinary political debate over the privacy rights of elected leaders.

Bossi, in her Oct 23 letter, states that within PruCare's network of doctors and pharmacies, many are situated within local neighborhoods. What she leaves unstated is that there is a campaign by PruCare with respect to pharmacies to bypass the small individually owned pharmacy and make member prescriptions reimbursable only when filled at chain pharmacies.   This effectively puts individually owned pharmacies at peril and is similar to the campaign by health maintenance organizations to buy up practitioner groups, thus positioning themselves to own conglomerates favored by the Clinton health plan. In short, the individual practitioner and the individual pharmacy can go the way of the dinosaur.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931103","headline":"Mantra for the Mayor: Deficit, Deficit, Deficit, Deficit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/03/opinion/mantra-for-the-mayor-deficit-deficit-deficit-deficit.html","abstract":"  Congratulations, Mr. Mayor-elect!

In other words, you're already in deep fiscal trouble.   It is not unusual for the victor to be rewarded with immediate fiscal woes.
