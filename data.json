There were about five shoe stores then. Now, there are about 30. Some people who had one store opened a second store. It takes a lot of space in this business. Everybody has about the same shoes and charges about the same price, but my store is special for boots. The other people don't have everything I have, because I import certain shoes and work with some people with whom I have exclusivity.

A few days later her nose had the same problem, only this time it was trying to track down fish and, probably, chips. It failed.   But, then, that's the way it is in New York once May arrives.

The victory will not silence critics like Ross Perot, who is again cluttering the airwaves with cheap shots safely fired from distant sound stages. But it certainly gives the lie, at the least for now, to Mr. Perot's claim that he alone can end gridlock.   There was a lot on the line Thursday, including Mr. Clinton's political reputation. The question was whether a man who'd been wrong-footing himself at every turn could summon the energy to save his budget plan -- the centerpiece of an economic strategy that would surely have crashed, perhaps taking his Presidency with it, had the Republicans prevailed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"One Idea, and That a Bad One","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/books/one-idea-and-that-a-bad-one.html","abstract":"THE MAN WHO STAYED BEHIND\nBy Sidney Rittenberg and Amanda Bennett.\nIllustrated. 476 pp. New York:\nSimon & Schuster. $25.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"The World Is Wide Open","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/style/egos-ids-the-world-is-wide-open.html","abstract":"  NAME: Liv Tyler.

To watch Paloma Herrera and Parrish Maynard on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House, where American Ballet Theater is performing through June 12, is to see two of the company's rising stars bring vivid individual color to a centuries-old art.   Ms. Herrera, a dark-haired, dark-eyed 17-year-old from Buenos Aires, joined the company in 1991 and is a member of the corps de ballet, though she often dances solo roles.

Those who did without slipping over the poverty line either made a fortune in junk bonds or heard the basic capitalist commandment grow as loud as a bass amplifier: \"Thou shalt want more and more.\" The tendency to commodify just about everything, a tendency of long standing, swelled in that decade to a kind of Wagnerian climax. Art, far from being exempt, had already become an investment vehicle and went through boom and bust cycles as if paintings were the Nasdaq composite. Photographs now tagged along for the ride.   Before there was even an art market for photography, the camera was deeply implicated in the commodification business. In the 19th century, photographs contributed to the translation of personality into consumer merchandise that came to be called celebrity. In the 1920's, when advertisers realized how effective they already were in whetting appetites, photographs became central to the selling of desire. Then in the 80's, just as large numbers of photographers decided to critique the consumption of images, the market finally decided that photographs were worth money and turned them into commodities too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"It's Substitution Time in Vermont","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/sports/sports-people-basketball-it-s-substitution-time-in-vermont.html","abstract":"  PAM BORTON, an assistant coach at the University of Vermont for five years, is the school's new women's basketball coach.

The best-selling author and aviator had come to America for four weeks; he remained for more than two years. He was rarely unhappier, or more productive: in his 27 American months he wrote more than half the pages by which he would be remembered, including \"The Little Prince,\" published in New York 50 years ago this spring in both English and French. A half-century after its first publication, that slim volume has done as much to undermine as to sustain Saint-Exupery's reputation as a philosophizing Hemingway, a Conrad of the skies, a French T. E. Lawrence; however, it continues to sell 100,000 copies a year in the United States alone.   Saint-Exupery enjoyed a triumphant welcome to New York, a city that looked dazzling and wild with animation after the ashen skies and curfews of Europe.

Contrary to what the article states, the reconstruction will not destroy 20,000 square feet of wetlands nor will it involve areas which are shellfish seedbeds or natural habitats for migratory birds such as the great blue herons.    To assess the project's impact to the wetlands, one must determine the current condition of the area. A comparison of the 1974 New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Tidal Wetlands Map with present onsite conditions indicates a deterioration of the intertidal marsh as a result of roadway runoff, which has increased siltation, raising elevations in the area. If no reconstruction occurs, the degradation will continue and result in the loss of both intertidal marsh islands that exist in the area and the intertidal strip along the western tidal bank. In addition, the siltation has restricted tidal flows to the wetlands south of the roadway, causing the quality of the wetland to be degraded to the lowest classification.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"SURFACING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/style/surfacing.html","abstract":"  MUSIC -- Album art: Rock-and-roll art may never die, despite vinyl's downfall.

Fifty of those works have been rounded up by the museum that he endowed, the Neuberger Museum at the State University of New York here, for an exhibition honoring his 90th birthday on July 21. \n\nMr. Neuberger, whose brokerage house -- Neuberger & Berman in midtown Manhattan -- now manages more than $25 billion, had a serendipitous period in the 1920's in Paris. He attended art school there and taught himself art appreciation by haunting museums and galleries. Mr. Neuberger continued the practice when he returned to America to work on Wall Street. He bought his first major picture, \"Boy From the Plains\" by Peter Hurd, in 1939 largely because the profile of the young cowboy reminded him of Piero della Francesca's portraits.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"A New Effort Aims to Raise Housing Aid","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/nyregion/a-new-effort-aims-to-raise-housing-aid.html","abstract":"  In an aggressive new effort to prevent families from becoming homeless, New York City has begun helping hundreds of welfare recipients facing eviction obtain rental grants that can be almost double what the state normally offers.

That was the good news for them; the bad news was that the occupancy rate for hotels in the United States was still only 60 percent, with the increase mainly caused by a slowing of hotel-building. This, in turn, is good for travelers, because it means there are many special summer rates, particularly ones designed to appeal to families that might otherwise stay with relatives to save money in tough times. Many of the new rates go into effect this weekend and run into September.    Notable this year are the offers from high-priced resorts, including some in the Caribbean and elsewhere outside the United States. And Club Med, which has usually had a family program at five of its clubs for specified periods between May and December, has added specials at two more clubs -- Caravelle on Guadeloupe and Huatulco in Mexico, for children 6 through 11, during July and August only. Some other resort promotions focus on day camps for children, with T-shirts, trips and cookouts, usually for an added fee.  A Sampling of Programs    Here is a selection of the more interesting summer packages.    Ramada International Hotels and Resorts -- not the domestic Ramada Inns -- calls its promotion a Summer Sale. Rates at all 11 of the group's hotels and resorts in the Caribbean and Latin America are reduced 30 to 50 percent through Sept. 30. In the Caribbean, the rates range from $75 a night at the Yacht Haven Hotel and Marina in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, to $100 a night at the Treasure Island Resort at Grand Cayman. In Latin America, the rates are $55 to $80 a night. Up to four people, children included, may stay in the room. Ramada International, 2655 Le Jeune Road, Suite 800, Coral Gables, Fla. 33134; (800) 854-7854.    Marriott's Family Room promotion has a twist: The stay must be paid for in full by credit card 21 days in advance, and the reservation is nonrefundable and not changeable. The rates for the 185 participating Marriott Hotels in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico (not Marriott's Courtyard, Residence or Fairfield Inns) start at $49 a night on weekends, a discount of 55 percent off regular prices, and $59 a night on weekdays, and range up to $139 in Hawaii on the weekend and $192 in New York on weekdays. Up to five people may occupy a room; one or two children aged 10 or younger may eat free from a children's menu for each adult entree ordered at breakfast, lunch or dinner. The special offer extends from June 18 to Sept. 6. Up to four rooms may be reserved. (The rate may not be available where there are conventions in town.) Marriott Hotels, Marriott Drive, Washington, D.C. 20058; (800) 228-9290.    Radisson is offering its Shades of Summer promotion for the fifth year. This program, which continues until Sept. 6, applies to all Radisson hotels in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, London, Berlin and Australia. The rates vary by hotel, with the lowest nightly rate $49; half the 277 properties are offering rates of $59 a night or less. Reservations are required, to confirm availability; some resorts may have a policy of advance payment. When there are local festivals or sports events, the rates may not be available. Radisson Hotels International, Post Office Box 59159, Minneapolis, Minn. 55459; (800) 333-3333.    Inter-Continental Hotels is offering discounts of up to 50 percent in its Summer Options program at 11 hotels in the United States and Canada. At the New Orleans Inter-Continental, the rate is $99 a night, single or double occupancy, with children under 14 sharing parents' rooms for free; the New York rate is $179 and the rate at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco is $129. Other options include an adjoining room at 50 percent of the Summer Options rate. The program runs until Sept. 12. Inter-Continental Hotels, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 327-0200.    Wyndham Hotels and Resorts offer a program called Kids on Us until Sept. 30 at Rose Hall, near Montego Bay, Jamaica; Elbow Beach, Paget, Bermuda; Heywoods at St. Peter, Barbados; the Ambassador Beach Resort in Nassau, and the Morgan Bay in Choc Bay on St. Lucia. Under this program, in its second summer, children 12 and under eat free from a children's menu when they eat with parents, and children 18 and under stay free in their parents' room, or qualify for discounts on a second room. Kids Klub activities are offered free from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. for two groups: children 5 to 8, and those 9 to 12. At Morgan Bay, where the price includes meals, the per-person charge for a three-night package with two paying guests in a room starts at $405. A three-night package at Rose Hall starts at $174 a person when two paying guests share the room. Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, 2001 Bryan Street, Suite 2300, Dallas, Tex. 75201; (800) 822-4200.    The 13 Hawthorn Suites in seven states, mostly in the South, are offering packages that may include tie-ins to nearby attractions -- a one-day pass to Sea World in Orlando, Fla., for example. The two-room suites can sleep six people, and full breakfasts are included. The rates start at $80 a night in Arlington, Tex., and run up to $118 for an Orlando offer that includes a minivan rental. All Hawthorn Suites have pools except for the one in Charleston, S.C. Hawthorn Suites, 400 Fifth Avenue, Waltham, Mass. 02154; (800) 527-1133.    On Hilton Head, S.C., Westin Resort's Family Fun package offers parents a room with balcony for two nights for $409; a children's room with balcony for two nights is $240.  Prices include one day of bicycle rental and free meals for children under 10 who eat with their parents. (Children 18 and under in families not buying the package may stay free in their parents' room.) The resort, for the second year, is also offering a recreation program for children 5 to 12 years old, Camp Wackatoo, through Labor Day. This costs $35 a day for the first child, $20 for the second, but it is free for children under the package plan. The Westin also provides strollers, car seats and playpens as well as cribs, free of charge.

Until Oct. 31, rates at the Sandy Lane Hotel and Golf Club in St. James, Barbados, begin at $395 a night for garden-view rooms and rise to $520 for the best ocean-view room. Children up to 12 stay in their parents' room free. Meals are included. The hotel is starting a nanny service, available from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., which is free for children up to 6 years old. For children 7 and up, there is a $6-an-hour charge for the service. The same fee is charged for other children's activities, including sports lessons, movies and excursions. Sandy Lane Hotel and Golf Club, St. James, Barbados, West Indies; (809) 432-1311; fax (809) 432-2954.  Camp With a Western Theme    The Pointe Hilton at Squaw Peak, one of three Pointe Hiltons in Phoenix, is offering a new program, Coyote Camp, which features a different Western theme each day. A main attraction is meeting wranglers and learning about the care of horses. Children 5 to 12 may participate from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily, at a cost of $35 a day for each child. At all three resorts, children under the age of 18 stay free in their parents' suites, which have two television sets and a refrigerator. Until Sept. 15, the rate for suites is $69 a night.

Squares or small parks, these sanctuaries sometimes possess a peculiarly Parisian elegance and grandeur. Others have a quiet charm that is distinctly provincial, suggestive of boules and pastis in the dusk.   To walk among these squares, particularly in summer, alternating the hectic activity of this eminently commercial city with moments of quietness, is to experience an essential quality of Paris. For part of the charm of this town lies in the way it amalgamates many moods and images, conjuring, in a sudden grandiose vista, the glory of a certain notion of France, only to evoke, a moment later, the intimacy of village life through the figure of a surly concierge mopping a sidewalk in her bathrobe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"Five Writers + One Star = A Hit?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/movies/film-five-writers-one-star-a-hit.html","abstract":"  In Hollywood, nearly every one dreams of the big score.

First, the grill or the source of heat must be searingly hot so the fish can take on appetizing color before it is overcooked. Second, the fish should have a firm enough texture so it does not fall apart.    Adequate preheating and sufficient coals should guarantee that the grill is hot when it is time to cook fish. Placing the grate as close as possible to the heat source enhances intensity.    As for types of fish that are best for grilling, thick steak fish -- like tuna, swordfish and shark -- head the list. Monkfish is also excellent, as is mahi-mahi, tilefish and salmon. Softer fish like cod and halibut are more difficult to handle, and it is also not advisable to attempt fish that come in thin fillets, like flounder.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"At Georgetown, Poet Urges Respect for Arts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/us/commencements-at-georgetown-poet-urges-respect-for-arts.html","abstract":"  Mona Van Duyn, former poet laureate of the United States, gave the main speech yesterday at the 194th commencement of Georgetown University in Washington.

With Long Island Sound on the east, the Hudson River on the west and many lakes, ponds and streams scattered in between, Westchester residents don't need to venture to the Hamptons for the beaches or upstate to pursue fishing and canoeing.   Despite such outward trappings of the suburbs as shopping centers, multiplex movie theaters and fast-food outlets, the county is more connected to nature than many residents might suspect. And the variety of outdoor activities extends far beyond a foray to a golf course or a visit to a nature center.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"Mariana Stockly, Benjamin Tupper","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/style/weddings-mariana-stockly-benjamin-tupper.html","abstract":"  Mariana du Pont Stockly, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A.

He translated that impression into one of the most powerful images of head-spinning anxiety ever created, \"The Scream\" (1893). Munch (1863-1944), who lived by what he once described as a gospel of pain, expressed the anguish of broken relations, death and illness, isolation and despair in a continuing project, \"The Frieze of Life.\" This thematic series of paintings, which includes such famous works as \"The Dance of Life\" (1900) as well as \"The Scream,\" was first exhibited in 1902 and again, with new pictures, in 1913 and 1918. All 85 paintings are reproduced in EDVARD MUNCH: The Frieze of Life (National Gallery Publications/Abrams, $45); unfortunately, the color is disappointingly muddy. Happily, however, four excellent essays examine aspects of Munch's tempestuous life and proto-Expressionist style. Reinhold Heller, a professor of art history at the University of Chicago, writes entertainingly of the bohemian cafe set in Oslo, where heady discussions of Nietzsche, free love and free thought inspired both Munch and Strindberg to test their limits in a debilitating cycle of drink and problematic affairs that often ended in abandonment, coercion and emotional abuse. Not surprisingly, Munch's women are often either Magdalenes or Madonnas -- lustful, ruined women or prepubescent innocents -- who entwine men in tangles of overpowering feeling. However, Munch's images do not add up to a pessimistic vision of blind despair. His subjects are often caught in a moment not just of pain but of awakening and awareness, as in \"Desire\" (1907), in which a woman looks up in horror as a man buries his face in her bosom. An element of mystery -- what unsettling truth has pressed its way into her mind? -- saves the image from hopeless melodrama. And that is a condition, this book makes plain, that Munch's work, and life, sailed dangerously near.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930530","headline":"A Directory of Jewish Organizations","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/30/nyregion/a-directory-of-jewish-organizations.html","abstract":"THOSE wishing to find a synagogue or a Jewish organization in the county can do so with a new publication published by the Westchester Jewish Conference. \n\nThe 48-page directory provides the first comprehensive listing of temples and Jewish organizations in the county.

The 52-year-old Rose has exchanged the baseball cap and jersey for a white fireproof jumpsuit, an orange helmet and a bulging life vest. And instead of running the bases, he is driving a monster of an offshore powerboat, a red 40-footer that will take him to speeds approaching 120 miles an hour.   The 2,200-horsepower boat, Hit King, is one of many new diversions in the life of a man who rewrote the record books with 4,256 career hits. Rose's gambling led to his banishment from baseball in 1989. And in 1990, his failure to file proper income tax returns sent him to prison for five months. The abrupt and brutal end of an extraordinary career sent him searching for other competitive outlets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930531","headline":"Review/Music; Anthrax Brings the Noise, but Now With Melody","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/arts/review-music-anthrax-brings-the-noise-but-now-with-melody.html","abstract":"  \"What do you think of the new guy?\" the guitarist Scott Ian asked fans when Anthrax performed at the Grand on May 24. The new guy was John Bush, Anthrax's new lead vocalist, who also co-wrote the songs on the band's new album, \"Sound of White Noise\" (Elektra). To break him in, Anthrax was finishing up a six-date club tour before returning to its usual arena circuit.   With Mr. Bush, Anthrax's music shifts just slightly from the speed-metal that has sold millions of Anthrax albums since the mid-1980's. The band used to touch on slow heavy-metal riffing on the way to doubletime speed-metal blitzes with fast, one-note chanted lyrics. Now the slow passages are longer, and there's often a melody within the crashing, churning, pounding guitars and drums. The transformation of Anthrax isn't as drastic as Metallica's was, but both have decided to use just enough outside elements to break free of the speed-metal genre and crash the rock mainstream.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930531","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/nyregion/chronicle-777093.html","abstract":"  The estranged PRINCE and PRINCESS OF WALES made a rare appearance together yesterday at a service in Liverpool, England, marking the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic.

He and his brother Charlie billed themselves as \"The Monroe Brothers.\" Bill later formed his own group, the Bluegrass Boys, and in 1939 took up a decades-long residency at the Grand Ole Opry. This television tribute, produced by Steve Gebhardt Film and Video, traces the extraordinary influence Mr. Monroe has had not just on country music but also on rock and other popular music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930531","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/arts/dance-in-review-042893.html","abstract":"  Michael Mao Florence Gould Hall","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930531","headline":"Leigh Finer, Daniel Waxman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/style/weddings-leigh-finer-daniel-waxman.html","abstract":"  Leigh Victoria Finer, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. David J.

But because this lightning is choreographed by George Balanchine, everything is always under control, and the electrical storm is awesome without also being threatening.    Gestures are jagged and patterns are restless throughout the work, which was offered by the New York City Ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater as part of the Balanchine Celebration. Balanchine obviously listened closely to the Stravinsky score that serves as the ballet's title. What he heard inspired him in several ways. The choreography's nervous energy is obviously a response to that of the music. Yet the score never grows hysterical; Stravinsky created an ultimately orderly wildness. So did Balanchine.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930531","headline":"Big City Budget Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/opinion/big-city-budget-reality.html","abstract":"  New York City's fiscal watchdogs have no teeth, officially, but they can bite nonetheless. And bite they did last week. In an extraordinary public critique, the three private-sector members of the Financial Control Board told the world what they have been telling Mayor David Dinkins for some time now -- that the city must stop living beyond its means, and do it quickly.   Their timing was politically inopportune for the Mayor, seeking re-election this year. But, in politics, when is fiscal belt-tightening ever opportune?

Tanglewood, Caramoor and the like are yet to begin, but in the middle of Manhattan the concert and performance series at Bryant Park has acted as a kind of spring harbinger for the summer. The latest in these brief al fresco events was a collection of three short comic operas put on by the New York Chamber Ensemble for a few hundred sun-drenched listeners and passersby on Saturday afternoon. The pieces were Hindemith's \"Hin und Zuruck\"; \"The Telephone\" by Gian Carlo Menotti, and Douglas Moore's soap-opera opera, \"Gallantry.\"   Previous events in Bryant Park, at least the ones this writer has attended, have faced some pretty stiff competition from traffic along the Avenue of the Americas and on 42d Street. But whether it was the weekend slowdown or the placing of the small stage at the east rather than the west end of the park, music held its own against city noise more effectively than I can remember it ever doing so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930531","headline":"E.

Balanchine's own brand of 20th-century neo-classicism is evident in his reworking of classical technique in this sparkling gem of a ballet.

The first half was principally Baroque, offering, among pieces by Sweelinck and Grigny, Bach's C-major Trio Sonata: chaste and cheerful outer movements, an austere Largo in between.

A Princeton University astrophysicist has concluded that these and many other predictions are not only possible, but can be made with 95 percent reliability.   As he described his hypothesis in the current issue of the British journal Nature, the scientist, Dr. J. Richard Gott 3d, proposed that the longevity of things can be estimated remarkably well from their histories. All that is needed to calculate roughly how long something is likely to last is to assume that there is nothing special about it -- nothing to particularly distinguish it from all the other objects or systems or creatures or intervals of time in its class.

In this, his 25th work, as in his other studies of American institutions, from a hospital to a race track to Central Park, he allows his subject to reveal itself, the mundane along with the sensational.   What that means for tomorrow night's two-hour visit to the Miami Metrozoo are many pictures of fauna on both sides of the bars. The zoo workers are efficient and conscientious, the visiting children are cute and the elephants, chimpanzees, zebras and so forth are easy to look at, even if you think you recognize most of them from other public television programs. But they do not make for steadily enthralling television.

While its strategy of provoking opponents to overreach themselves and then surround and destroy their frailly supported, advanced units did not become a self-conscious approach to the chess openings until the rise of players like Richard Reti, Gyula Breyer and Aron Nimzovich in the 1920's, this had been stock in trade to the Spartan infantry at least as early as the Persian Wars in the Fifth Century B.C.   Its lure in chess is the spirit of adventure that accompanies a bold plan. What if the opponent's thrust becomes a juggernaut? You are crushed. But what satisfaction there is in undermining the enemy outposts and pouring through the gaps to victory.
