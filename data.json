It includes several handy utility programs that address some of the common problems a typical PC user faces from time to time, including lack of hard disk space, the risk of viruses, the need for an easy way to make backup copies, the annoyance of out-of-memory messages and sluggish system performance.   In short, DOS 6.0 is great for most PC users, especially beginners and casual users. The new utilities do their jobs well. For computer hot-rodders, though, the DOS 6.0 utilities are just training wheels. There are other utility programs on the market that work faster, offer more options or in other ways surpass their DOS counterparts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930406","headline":"For Openers, Gooden and Key Close Down the Batters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/06/sports/baseball-for-openers-gooden-and-key-close-down-the-batters.html","abstract":"  The pitch chart showed 101 entries, a document full of splendid explosions of power and deception.

Sniper Attack on Rally    On Tuesday, this besieged city will mark the first anniversary of the attack that most people regard as the first volley of the brutal war here, a burst of Serbian sniper fire from a third-floor window of the Holiday Inn that killed several people in a crowd demonstrating outside the Bosnian Parliament for peace and national unity.

Those shots set off the train of events that led to World War I. 'The City Is Destroyed'    But the Sarajevo that emerged from World War I and from World War II, when it was occupied by Nazi forces, suffered only mild physical damage in comparison with the cataclysm wrought by the Serbian siege of the last year.

One declarer arrived in the obvious five-diamond contract and played it in the obvious way: Play the top diamonds and if the queen does not fall, try the heart finesse.

That may partly explain why tournament directors, who spend much of their working lives walking briskly to a table at which some misdemeanor has occurred, frequently become octogenarians and even nonagenarians.    A case in point is Jack Gordon of Detroit, who died last December at the age of 88. His 30-year career as a director at tournament and club games continued until he was 81. Like many directors, he started his bridge life as a successful player, as indicated by the diagramed deal that helped him win a title in 1954. It was reported by his son, Robb Gordon of Manhattan, who is one of the most successful players in the New York metropolitan area.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930407","headline":"Japan's Leader to Replace Foreign Minister","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/07/world/japan-s-leader-to-replace-foreign-minister.html","abstract":"  One week before Japan is to be host for a high-level international conference on providing aid to Russia, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa decided today to name a relative newcomer to international affairs to replace his ailing Foreign Minister, setting off an intense power struggle in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

Tonight, as always, he was a marvel of whiteness, a Santa Claus of health, from his flawless white high-button shoes to the cusp of his Vandyke and the fine pale tenacious hair that clung to his scalp.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930407","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/07/nyregion/metro-digest-113693.html","abstract":"  NEW YORK CITY  DINKINS FOCUSES ON SCHOOL ELECTIONS   Moving to outmaneuver conservative groups seeking to win dozens of seats on New York City's school boards, Mayor Dinkins has mounted a huge city-financed campaign to encourage voters to turn out.

Dinkins yesterday suspended negotiations with a company selected to run many of the operations in New York City's Parking Violations Bureau until investigators determine whether company executives were implicated in a bribery scandal in the mid-1980's.   Former officials of the company, Lockheed Information Management Services Company, admitted at trials in 1987 that they had paid off city officials to land multimillion-dollar contracts with the Parking Violations Bureau. Those contracts with the company, then called the Datacom Corporation, were awarded to collect overdue fines.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930408","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/08/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-94115965698.html","abstract":"Violence and Nonviolence .

Cuomo said today that he had asked President Clinton to remove him from consideration for an appointment to the United States Supreme Court, saying he wished to continue serving New York while the state was on the cusp of economic recovery.   Many in the Cuomo administration interpreted the Governor's announcement as a virtual declaration that he will run for a fourth four-year term next year. Mr. Cuomo said in an interview today that he was preparing aggressively for a 1994 campaign but was not ready to make a declaration.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930408","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/08/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-93825128677.html","abstract":"1918: Big Gun Backfires.

The elements of its jazz-dance style -- high, split-legged jumps, cross-stage runs and spinning turns -- have been seen on Broadway and on the concert dance stage for years. But there was a magnificent weight and evocative power to \"Morning Songs\" and to its surging score by Charles Mingus that are rare in modern and jazz dance today.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930408","headline":"Ethics Committee Decides to Investigate Senator's Links to Bank","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/08/us/ethics-committee-decides-to-investigate-senator-s-links-to-bank.html","abstract":"  The Senate Ethics Committee opened a preliminary inquiry today into the relationship between the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a Middle Eastern bank that collapsed two years ago amid spectacular instances of fraud, and Senator Orrin G.
