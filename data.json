The authorities announced that two suspects had been indicted in the murder, and law-enforcement officials said that five others had been arrested in the conspiracy but that the indictments against them had been sealed. A1. The Cali cocaine cartel is a strong and brutal presence in Jackson Heights. B2. 17 MONTHS LATER, ANOTHER SON IS KILLED    A Marine Corps recruiting sergeant home on leave for Mother's Day was shot and killed as he sat on a Bronx park bench a few feet from the spot where his only brother was shot and killed 17 months ago. B3. CHOICE BETWEEN RIVALS TROUBLES DINKINS   An effort to forge a black-Hispanic coalition to bolster Mayor Dinkins's re-election campaign has led to a standoff between a black and a Hispanic candidate for the city's No. 2 office and put the Mayor in a delicate bind between political calculation and old loyalties. B3. A majority of the New York City Board of Education lined up to elect Carol A. Gresser, a longtime parent association leader in Queens, as the next board president, but Mayor Dinkins made a last-minute plea to delay the vote. B3. REGION  RAIL NETWORK IS EXPLORED   With faith that three-hour train trips from New York to Boston will be commonplace in a few years, about 100 rail experts gathered in Warwick, R.I., to sketch out the next step: an advanced rail network that would extend over much of eastern North America. B4. DUN & BRADSTREET TO MOVE STAFF   In what Connecticut officials hailed as a victory for their economic-development campaign, Dun & Bradstreet, the financial information company, said that it had accepted a $7.2 million grant from Hartford and would move its headquarters staff of 300 people from midtown Manhattan to Wilton, Conn. B5. SCHOOL OFFICIALS OPPOSE STATE TAKEOVER   Undaunted by a scathingly critical state report on Newark's schools, the school district's officials acknowledged problems but said they remained unalterably opposed to a state takeover of the system. B5. FEWER SHAD IN THE HUDSON   Swimming upstream with the tides, shad are returning from the Atlantic Ocean to the Hudson River later than usual and in smaller numbers. Commercial fishermen in the river attributed the late season to a cold March. B5. BUNGEE JUMPING FROM CRANES IS BANNED   New Jersey banned bungee jumping from cranes, but said the sport could continue where permanent platforms are built. B4.

Sampras is playing in his second tournament on clay this season and his first on the slower, red surface in Europe. He was generally satisfied with his game in the 1-hour-39-minute match, especially for having staved off a third set on a hot, sunny day at the Foro Italico. Sampras saved a set point when the 50th-ranked Furlan returned a deep service into the net, and the American later ended the match with an ace in the tie breaker. Fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who is also more accustomed to faster surfaces, defeated Jaime Oncins, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, and then called the victory his best match of his injury-plagued season. Jan Siemerink beat No. 12-seeded MaliVai Washington, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), to score the first upset in the $1.75 million tournament. Scheduled to play their opening matches today are second-seeded Jim Courier, the defending champion at the Italian Open, and third-seeded Boris Becker, who has won only two matches in four clay-court tournaments this spring. Meanwhile, the ATP Tour announced it was conducting anti-doping tests during the Italian Open, the first time since implementing stricter penalties in March.

He has come to the wilderness for a weekend of escapism and he enters carrying the remains of a six-pack of beer. In other words, in this attenuated comedy sketch by a group of Chicagoans, Mr. Wendt is a Norm of the north woods.   To his dismay, he has unwittingly signed up for an adventure in male bonding and mind-and-body purification. In raw, primitive fashion, he is supposed to discover his natural masculinity as well as \"the woman within.\" \"Wild Men!\" begins on a farcical note with Mr. Wendt trying to adjust himself to the horrors of his healthy surroundings. His fellow bonders express varying degrees of dweebishness. Led by Rob Riley, the weekend's guide, this band is about to be tested for its power of survival.

When I wrote the history of Pennsylvania Station, it amazed and delighted me to see young people, too young to have walked through the station, feel such an emotional connection to it. I still get calls from one young man who refuses to accept that the station, which has been gone for three decades, cannot be reconstructed.

Fernandez, who was placed on the disabled list late last week because of a slight cartilage tear in his knee, will miss from four to six weeks. The loss of the left-hander, the club's most consistent pitching performer last season, will only increase the demands on a staff that has to date been a serious disappointment.

Why do clothes shrink?   A.  The answer has to do with the chemical and physical properties of fibers from natural sources, especially cotton, wool and linen, said Dr. Ann Lemley, associate professor in the department of textiles and apparel at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.   The individual fibers in yarns are made of long polymer chains, or strands of giant molecules, according to Dr. Lemley, who is a chemist. In their natural state, the chains are scrolled up or crinkled. In preparing them for spinning and weaving, the first step is usually a straightening of the fibers by processes like carding wool.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930511","headline":"Ex-Employee Is Convicted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/nyregion/ex-employee-is-convicted.html","abstract":"  A former employee of a Gap clothing store was convicted yesterday of murdering the store's assistant manager during a robbery.

For all its clever pacing, its literate libretto and its surprising lyricism, \"The Rake\" seems deep in private conversation with its models. We are struck by the theatrical aptness of Stravinsky's arias, scenas, ensembles and continuo writing, yet never for a moment do listeners cease to think thoughts like, \"Anne Truelove, you are singing as Mozart would want you to,\" or, \"How cleverly this 20th-century composer dresses recitativo secco in his own clothes.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930511","headline":"Choice Between Black and Hispanic Rivals for Advocate Troubling Dinkins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/nyregion/choice-between-black-and-hispanic-rivals-for-advocate-troubling-dinkins.html","abstract":"  An effort to forge a black-Hispanic coalition to bolster Mayor David N.

Before last night's game against the visiting Florida Marlins, the club was 1-6 in one-run games, without a victory in extra innings and 3-10 in its last 13 games at Shea Stadium. The Mets average stood at .230 and the bullpen was 0-7. So the Mets aren't in last place because of unrealized potential, but because of fully realized shortcomings. Any notion that the Mets can be rehabilitated in 1993 requires a great leap of faith, and the Mets Aren't too good at any kind of leaping these days. MANAGER WATCH    The mananger won't be fired any time soon, or so ownership has said. Jeff Torborg, above, whose relaxed approach has come perilously close to becoming a detached approach, has done nothing to shake up his club. There has been talk of togetherness, of effort. It is only talk, and when it comes from Torborg, the players seem to ignore it. DUGOUT DECOMPRESSION    Bobby Bonilla, right, the Met's first baseman of the future, might benefit from some time on the bench. His strikeout total is escalating disturbingly. The umpires don't have a good word to say about him; Shea fans say mostly boo, and maybe Bonilla and Mike Cubbage need to spend some quality time in the dugout talking over the game's finer points. HEY, BOBBY, SAY HI TO VINCE    Speed. Speed. Speed. Manufactured runs. Menace on the basepaths. New York has heard enough about Vince Coleman's potential threat and seen not nearly enough. The leadoff man had a .285 on-base percentage before last night. Why not sit Coleman, get Joe Orsulak in a more comfortable spot in left, get center fielder Dave Gallagher's bat (.391) in the lineup for a couple of weeks and make the Mets a decent defensive team. TRADE EMBARGO    The Mets say trading any significant player right now is impractical. Howard Johnson, right, has too much to prove at the moment to command from other clubs the value the Mets would want in return. Trading Sid Fernandez, even after his surgery, might net a useful player, but would leave a gaping hole in the No. 3 spot in the rotation. \"The best we could probably do would be one of those change-of-scenery types of deals where both clubs would be taking huge gambles,\" said one official. 30 DAYS OF GOOD BEHAVIOR    The Mets are one month of bad baseball away from 1993 irrelevance. They play the Cardinals and Expos this week and the Pirates and Phillies before the end of May. If they are 12 or more games out by then, the Mets are over and out. ONE MORE STOP BEFORE COOPERSTOWN    The Mets, if they fail to mount an assault on repectability this month, could make the trading of Eddie Murray their first order of bargain-basement business. The first baseman's numbers are still high enough to give him marketplace value. Would the Braves, who need offense and who have a ton of prospects, be interested? AN UNEVEN ODD YEAR    Bret Saberhagen, who began the year with a 74-30 career record in odd-numbered years, has only three victories this season, all against expansion teams. The right-hander has struggled to find his blowaway fastball and has had an occasionally cranky right shoulder. \"I've been pitching stupid and I'm sick and tired of it,\" Saberhagen said last week. \"My 7-year-old son has a better idea of how to pitch than I've had the last month.\" FOR PETE'S SAKE    Perhaps Pete Schourek, the left-hander with the 1-3 record, would profit from a stint in the bullpen, or the minors. Let Eric Hillman start a couple of games, fool some teams, maybe and meanwhile reignite Schourek's focus and talent. And why not promote Kevin Baez and reassign backup infielder Tim Bogar? CHAPTER 11, FILING AT DEADLINE    The Mets, if they are in the middle of nowhere in mid-summer, might declare their season bankrupt and stage a liquidation sale at the trading deadline. Johnson and Fernandez might garner a fair ransom of young talent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930511","headline":"In New Yorker Libel Trial, The Analyst Is Examined","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/us/in-new-yorker-libel-trial-the-analyst-is-examined.html","abstract":"  Jeffrey M.

Mr. Handler walked out of the Walter Kerr Theater, never to return to the role. A One-Man Disaster    He's back on stage now, in a new one-man show he's written, \"Time on Fire,\" at Second Stage Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street in Manhattan, which opens tomorrow.

It happened in the Great Depression: there were 10 years of stagnation that ended not because of any internal dynamic but from the massive spending for the war.

Searching for a key to unlock this awesome poetic drama, the director finds it in Peer's childhood fantasies, the dreams that he shares with his mother. To a background of trolls and international intrigue, the title character acts out one man's lifelong quest for spiritual self-awareness.   Coming after Mr. Bergman's highly politicized \"Hamlet\" and his revelatory season of Strindberg, Ibsen and O'Neill at the Brooklyn Academy, \"Peer Gynt\" reaffirms his position in the pantheon of experimental theater artists. In his 70's he retains a youthful brashness. His \"Peer Gynt\" is a fabulistic folk tale filled with visual richness and an ebullient sense of comedy. His first production of the play in 1957 was apparently stark and simple. It starred Max von Sydow, who had recently appeared in \"The Seventh Seal,\" which might have been considered a cinematic companion piece.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930513","headline":"Sin or Not, Supposed Relic Of Cross Is Sold in France","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/13/world/sin-or-not-supposed-relic-of-cross-is-sold-in-france.html","abstract":"  Despite warnings by a Vatican official that it is a sin to trade in relics, two slivers of olive wood said to come from the cross on which Jesus was crucified were sold for more than $18,000 in a crowded auction house here today.

At Christie's sale of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture last night, there was surprising enthusiasm. Not only did the expected gems sell and sell well, but even the so-called middle market, those works in the $500,000 range that have suffered most during the last two years, made a comeback.    The sale totaled $48.5 million, slightly above Christie's low estimate of $45 million, but well below its high estimate of $59 million. Of the 60 works for sale, 48 found buyers. While the figures didn't compare with Sotheby's Impressionist sale on Tuesday night, which totaled $75.9 million, Christie's, anticipating less of a success, was ecstatic.

Let the Fraud Begin    Starting late last Friday in Manhattan, while the machine was still running at the Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester, the first withdrawals began.

The observers would check all traffic moving across the frontier from Mr. Milosevic's Serbian republic into Bosnia to check on Belgrade's enforcement of its pledge to send only goods such as food and medicine to the Bosnian Serbs and to deny them fuel and military goods. Earlier this week Serbian officials in Belgrade said they would cooperate with such inspections.
