They are now the community's legitimate representatives. The organization is thus trying to renew itself by overtures to other seemingly ascendant leadership forces.

Big-name studio films and frenzied behind-the-scenes deal making, usually major aspects of the Cannes experience, have been low-key. Instead, something different has happened: Cannes looks more and more valuable as a launching pad for hand-picked specialty items, particularly when those films have international appeal. Interesting, offbeat film makers are the great beneficiaries when Hollywood stays home.   This year's perfect example is Nanni Moretti, a film maker whose popularity in Italy and France has suddenly exploded into worldwide attention. Mr. Moretti's work has had exposure on the film festival circuit (including a recent retrospective in Toronto). But there are many countries, including the United States, in which he is largely unknown.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940523","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/23/nyregion/c-corrections-182435.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday with the continuation of an article about New Yorkers' memories of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis rendered her son-in-law's first name incorrectly in some copies.

This examination of sexual relationships through three generations of black women has ambitions a short drama can't begin to embrace, and it sprawls awkwardly for well over an hour.   Still, it seems churlish to complain too much about a play that puts the sublime Mary Alice (best known from the television program \"I'll Fly Away\") on a New York stage again. Playing a laconic, compulsively tidy middle-age woman, she glows with a fever of lifelong disappointments. And when her character finally erupts into a fury of accumulated sorrows, she inspires pity and terror in a way that seems to belong to another time, another play. Ms. Alice could probably do an extraordinary Medea.

J. Foyt's decision to stick with the earlier qualifying speed of his driver, Bryan Herta, paid off yesterday at the Indianapolis 500 trials. The car survived four last-minute attempts to bump it out of the 33-car lineup for the race next Sunday. With 25 minutes left in qualifying, Marco Greco bumped Scott Goodyear with a four-lap, 10-mile run of 221.216 miles an hour in a Lola-Cosworth. After Greco qualified, Herta, Foyt's rookie driver, was the top man on the bump list as the slowest remaining car. Geoff Brabham then called off his run after three laps because he was going too slow. Mark Smith then spun and crashed in the first turn of his first lap. Gary Bettenhausen then ran two laps but called off the run as too slow. At that point, Foyt could have sent Herta out in a faster spare car, but he thought that Willy T. Ribbs, the only challenger left, did not have enough laps in his car to go fast enough. Foyt's decision worked, as Ribbs quit after two laps that were too slow.

The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the Federal Government's choice of which bases to close is not subject to challenge in court, thus foreclosing efforts by some states to save facilities in their areas.

That is the opinion not only of local hospitals, but also of independent analysts. The problem for New York is that the President's plan -- and Congressional knock-offs like the recent proposal by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts -- would pay for universal coverage primarily by imposing gargantuan Medicare cuts that are unevenly distributed.    About half of Mr. Clinton's in-patient Medicare cuts would come from hospitals that train doctors and hospitals that serve indigent communities. New York hospitals do a lot of both: they account for 5 percent of national in-patient Medicare expenditures, and about 15 percent of Medicare's contributions toward medical training and indigent care. And though universal coverage would provide inner-city hospitals with a new revenue stream, the extra fees would not come close to making up for the lost Medicare and other reimbursements.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940524","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/arts/classical-music-in-review-191531.html","abstract":"  Chris Merritt  Tenor Carnegie Hall   Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti have been reborn within the last generation, but the agile, high-altitude tenors to sing their roles have not.
