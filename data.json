Unable to employ her compelling novelistic voice, she burdens her characters with thematic dialogue that sometimes suggests a blueprint for an essay in The New York Review of Books.   Set in a middle-class living room in a New Jersey town, \"Black\" traces the deterioration of a dinner party given by a white woman and her black lover for the woman's ex-husband.

The show, in which Mr. Ross is joined by Jeanne Lehman, a redheaded singer whose pealing soprano contrasts bracingly with Mr. Ross's wry, clipped delivery, is a seamlessly written and performed party piece.

There were moments when his portrayal of Figaro's self-possession ended up as mere arrogance.   Stanford Olsen initially seemed underpowered as the Count; his light tenor paled next to Mr. Chernov's powerful sound.

The range of interests and the vision of Arthur Mitchell, founder of the troupe with Karel Shook, were clear on Tuesday night when the company presented the second of five programs in its ambitious anniversary season at the New York State Theater.    One of two strongly danced revivals, Domy Reiter-Soffer's \"Equus,\" is a narrative ballet about a boy, his psychiatrist and his horse. The other revival, Mr. Mitchell's pure-dance \"Fete Noire,\" offers an inspiring and poignant look back to the troupe's earliest years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940317","headline":"Review/Television; The Sounds That Crossed the Water and Took Root","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/17/movies/review-television-the-sounds-that-crossed-the-water-and-took-root.html","abstract":"  \"Irish Music and America,\" a documentary on the Disney Channel tonight, conveys the distinct and misleading impression that just about every American tune ever composed has its roots in Ireland. It's a harmless bit of blarney, much like insisting that on St. Patrick's Day everybody is Irish.   But \"A Musical Migration,\" as the show is subtitled, does make an impressive case for the widespread influence of Irish music and musicians. Brought to the United States by waves of immigrants, it can be found clearly in Civil War songs (\"The Lakes of Pontchartrain\"), in cowboy songs and, most obviously, in bluegrass and country music. Bono of the rock group U2 says: \"I didn't know I was Irish until I went to America. It was amazing to go to Graceland, the birthplace of rock-and-roll, and find that the Irish had already been there in their songs and in their tunes.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940317","headline":"RABIN SHORING UP CABINET COALITION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/17/world/rabin-shoring-up-cabinet-coalition.html","abstract":"  While in Washington trying to salvage the Middle East peace talks, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is shoring up his political base at home with legislative maneuvers that should bring back into the fold an errant religious party that had left his governing coalition.

As with the atrocities in Bosnia, sadly enough, extensive exposure invites emotional paralysis.    \"Ultimate Betrayal\" is based on a true story, although, in familiar television flimflammery, certain events and characters have been fictionalized. In May 1990, two adult sisters claiming severe childhood abuse sued their father in the Denver courts. The father, Edward J. Rodgers Jr., refused to appear in court. He was a former F.B.I. agent who had become a Colorado authority on child abuse. The sisters, supported by their two other sisters but angrily denounced by their two brothers, were awarded $2.3 million in compensation and the case led to a proposal for a Child Abuse Accountability Act to change statute-of-limitations rules.

Like his 1985 film, \"Hail Mary,\" this new work depicts the possible appearance of the divine in ordinary contemporary lives. But where \"Hail Mary\" outraged some Christians by reinventing one of their most sacred myths, here Mr. Godard plays it safe by reaching back to Greek mythology for his god figure. The story, he has said, is based partly on the legend in which Zeus impersonated Amphitryon in order to seduce Amphitryon's wife. In Mr. Godard's version, Amphitryon is named Simon Donnadieu (Gerard Depardieu).
