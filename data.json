Its initial reception at the Metropolitan Opera in 1958 was wildly enthusiastic; Dimitri Mitropoulos, who conducted the first performance, exclaimed, \"At last, an American grand opera!\" But the Met lost interest in the work a few years later, and Cecil Beaton's sumptuous sets were destroyed in a 1973 fire. The Washington Opera's visually splendid new staging, a co-production with the Dallas Opera that opened on Saturday at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, is one of very few attempts at this score in recent decades.   The principal reason for the opera's neglect is probably Gian Carlo Menotti's soggy libretto, which aims for the Gothic passions of Isak Dinesen and the subtle epiphanies of Chekhov but instead achieves a kind of uneventful, unpoetic melodrama. Vanessa, the melancholy aristocrat, falls for the young, caddish Anatol, the son of her former lover. Erika, her no less melancholy niece, also sleeps with Anatol, becomes pregnant and aborts her child to avoid compromising her aunt. Vanessa goes off with Anatol, unaware of his worthlessness, while Erika stays home and withdraws from the world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950116","headline":"A Feud Begins Among Simpson's Lawyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/16/us/a-feud-begins-among-simpson-s-lawyers.html","abstract":"  As O.

She, an Amazon molly fish, had sought copulation with a male, not to obtain his genes and mix them with her own to spawn the next generation, but simply for a quick chemical jump start. She needed his sperm to prod her eggs to split in twain and create clonal progeny, the fry all female and identical to the mother.    For his part, the male, a closely related species of molly fish that propagates through more normal channels of sexual reproduction, also appeared to benefit from the odd affair. As scientists showed last year, the male molly fish that copulates with an Amazon becomes immediately irresistible to the females of his own kind, who then hungrily mate with him and give his seed a chance to sire piscine multitudes. In this way, scientists proposed, a so-called gynogenetic species like the Amazon can persist, gaining the chemical prod of a male's sperm without giving him offspring in return.

Dexter Scott King, 33, the youngest son among the four King children, has succeeded succeed her.   Speaking to nearly 400 people gathered at Ebenezer Baptist Church on the 10th annual observance of the King holiday to mark what would have been Dr. King's 66th birthday, Mrs. King said she saw reasons for hope as crises abated in places like Rwanda, Haiti and parts of the Middle East, even though civil strife continued in places like Nigeria, Bosnia and Russia.   \"The most positive development for the state of the dream worldwide since we last met has been the establishment of a great new democracy in South Africa,\" she said.   Domestically, she said, political leaders seemed focused on budget deficits when the nation had a serious \"compassion deficit.\" Nevertheless, Mrs. King said she was optimistic about the future as she left the leadership of the King center to write about her life after her husband's assassination and to pursue some \"long overdue\" musical projects that would put her conservatory training as a singer to use.   \"I am leaving this ship of hope in good hands,\" she said of her son.   Since taking over last month, Mr. King has been involved in a public dispute with the National Park Service over control of a main site in the King Historic District here and the right to construct a major memorial to his father.   Only oblique mention was made of that dispute today as some who have been critical of the King center in the dispute, like Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta, sat on the dais alongside King family members for the official observance of the holiday.   But a reminder of the dispute was just outside the door of the church and across the street. There stood the half-demolished hulk of the city's Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, which city officials have deeded to the National Park Service over the objections of the King family for the construction of an $11 million visitors' center. If completed, the center is likely to become the gateway to the historic district, setting the tone for an estimated three million visitors a year, and possibly eclipsing the King family's plans for a high-tech, interactive museum.   In a voice strikingly reminiscent of the cadence and phrasing of his father, Dexter King said that Dr. King was part of American history and \"belonged to everyone spiritually\" but that his family was the guardian of his legacy until his dream was fulfilled.   \"My father delivered political freedom and I would like to deliver economic freedom,\" Mr. King said, sketching a goal that he said the King center was likely to pursue under his leadership. \"Had his life not been cut short, I believe economic empowerment would have been the next step and the King center should be the catalyst in that goal,\" he said. \"I'm calling home all those freedom fighters who marched with my father. Dexter Scott King is going to be there with you this time, and we will make it to the promise land.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Is the Future of China in Deng's Iron Hand?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/opinion/l-is-the-future-of-china-in-deng-s-iron-hand-434495.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Deng's Daughter Opens a Long-Shut Door\" (front page, Jan. 13): In anticipating the passing of the ailing Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, some Beijing leaders summoned to see him recently were startled by the harshness of his final bits of advice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950117","headline":"Woman Held In Drowning Of Two Sons Is Arraigned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/us/woman-held-in-drowning-of-two-sons-is-arraigned.html","abstract":"  Covering her eyes with her hands at the mention of her dead sons, Susan V.

Robert Shaw's choral rehearsals last week, ending with Sunday's concert of Brahms and Hindemith at Carnegie Hall, was full of them. It is the fifth year that Mr. Shaw has taken some 200 relative strangers, used teaching methods developed over a lifetime, and created splendid performances with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. All in just five days.   His method is calculated distortion: note values shorter than the ones composers wrote, syllables that are not in the score added to consonants, singing with numbers, not words, or words without pitches, asking singers to face one another as they rehearse or march in time rather than massing themselves as soprano, alto, tenor and bass. Mr. Shaw has been conducting choruses all his life and most of his singers here have, or aspire to, similar jobs. At Carnegie Hall's workshop series, leaders of church choirs and glee clubs from Sumter, S.C., to Dublin, Ohio, shop for new and better techniques to take home with them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950117","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/17/style/chronicle-392595.html","abstract":"  Fifty years ago today, Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who rescued tens of thousands of Jews in Hungary from the Nazis, disappeared into the Soviet Union.

It's time we started relating to Vietnam as a country, not a conflict. It's time that we declare victory and go back to Vietnam to reap it.    President Bush should have been the one to open relations. He knew it was the right thing to do, and he had the credibility with veterans' groups to do it. But he didn't. (Wouldn't be prudent.) President Clinton, despite his problems with Vietnam vets, has inched closer to Hanoi, by lifting economic sanctions last year and agreeing to a low-level liaison office this year.

Music, he seems to be telling us, has pulled itself apart from both ends of the cultural spectrum: the classical extremity eager to isolate high-mindedness and rise above the everyday; the pop end cornered by a concern for the bottom line and an obsession with rigid species and subspecies of style. Neither Mr. Bolcom's \"Commedia\" nor his Fifth Symphony, which Leonard Slatkin will conduct tomorrow, Friday and Saturday at Avery Fisher Hall, are new pieces.

The initial U.S. expeditionary force of 20,000 has been scaled back to some 5,600 soldiers, joined by about 2,000 troops from 20 other nations.   Conditions in Haiti are far from ideal and democracy is not yet secure. Many Haitians, particularly Aristide supporters, would like U.S. forces to stay on indefinitely.
