The new face of the alternative rock audience had revealed itself in all its glory, yelling \"go home\" and \"go Rangers\" as Mr. Chesnutt and his band tried to perform. It's probably time to find a new name for the genre, because Mr. Chesnutt, who has had to use a wheelchair for roughly a decade, seemed to be the alternative tonight.

It's easy to hear why he's so popular. At 28, Mr. Coltrane is rapidly acquiring a distinctive voice, with a thoughtfulness that sometimes eludes more experienced musicians.   His set on Tuesday night showed him to be an improviser who, in his reticence, forces a listener to follow him. At first he sounded almost timid. But after a few minutes it became clear his improvisations were loaded with turnbacks, repetitions, asides and afterthoughts, as if he were having a conversation with himself. He broke his solos into fragments, short bursts that were always self-referential and oddly balanced. Where jazz instrumentalists often seek a linear flow, Mr. Coltrane's solos were occasionally still, as if he were building a static monument out of ideas, repeated, examined, turned over, turned sideways and then added to a pile of previously used motifs.   He can burn, too. Backed by Billy Childs on piano, Calvin Jones on bass and Cindy Blackman on drums, Mr. Coltrane, on up-tempo tunes, draped harmony over harmony, compressing dense phrases into small spaces. He has the gift of ease and even ideas that should have been unmanageably dissonant, or pitches that sailed way off the mark, floated back into his schema. Mr. Coltrane hasn't yet figured out how to use dynamics, or articulate all his ideas. And he doesn't have a group conception, at least on the evidence of this one set. But he has promise, intelligence and individuality, which is more than half the battle.

Under the cap, mothers who give birth while on welfare would receive no additional money for the care of the additional child. That will do little good and much harm. According to nearly every careful study, family caps do nothing to discourage childbirth but they do victimize innocent children.   Family caps, which are also included in several bills already before Congress, are based on the false notion that larger benefit checks encourage welfare mothers to have more babies and thereby stay longer on welfare. But a welfare mother would have to be crazy to think of babies as an economic advantage. The average extra stipend to welfare mothers who give birth is less than $75 a month -- which does not even cover the cost of diapers and other expenses for the new baby.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/nyregion/news-summary-336327.html","abstract":"  International A3-11  JAPAN BALKS AT SANCTIONS  The Clinton Administration's plan to seek new global sanctions against North Korea for its defiance of nuclear inspectors has run into resistance from Japan.

What could produce a revolution is the reaction of advocates for the homeless.\n\nFor years, New Yorkers have taken on faith the claims of groups like the Coalition for the Homeless and the Partnership for the Homeless that they alone know the best interests of their clientele. It may have seemed contrary to common sense that the homeless have an unconditional right to government shelter, for which not even the performance of basic housekeeping duties can be asked in return. But when the advocates won such a right in court in 1981, New Yorkers wrote a multimillion-dollar blank check to pay for it. It may have seemed contrary to common sense that the homeless have a permanent right to camp in public spaces and parks, but when the advocates told New Yorkers that they were callous to complain, they bit their tongues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940609","headline":"Member Won't Quit School Board Post","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/nyregion/member-won-t-quit-school-board-post.html","abstract":"  Irritated that her adversaries had suggested she was being forced out, a Queens school board member announced yesterday that she was rescinding her decision to resign and would stay in her post, at least for now.

From the beginning to the end of his prodigious career, his intimates -- friends, dealers, children -- figured frequently in his art, and depictions of women, predominantly his wives and mistresses, form its very core. Few artists have invented so many ways to convert the machinations of ego and id into image.    At no time in Picasso's oeuvre was the overlap of life and art more clear-cut, intense or esthetically fruitful than in the tumultuous years of 1927 to 1942. This period saw the bitter failure of his marriage to the Russian dancer Olga Koklova and his passionate but manipulative affairs with successive and competing mistresses: Marie-Therese Walter, who when he met her was a 17-year-old schoolgirl, and the photographer Dora Maar. In addition, Picasso's personal turmoil was heightened by the wanton violence of the Spanish Civil War, which gave him a renewed and anguished awareness of his homeland that culminated in \"Guernica,\" the monumental mural he painted in the spring of 1937 for the Spanish Pavilion of the Paris World's Fair.   Now, for the first time, some of Picasso's most personal works from these years are the subject of their own show. \"Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar,\" organized by Judi Freeman for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, has come to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, albeit in a substantially enlarged and reconfigured form.    By the standards of many Picasso shows, it is rather small -- only 84 works -- but it is nonetheless exciting and revealing. Like most Picasso shows, it has something for everyone, and then some.    For the general public, it has extra amounts of the usual Picasso fireworks: love and passion, anger and catharsis, empathy and despair, spelled out in a series of powerful, often richly worked paintings and drawings. Throughout the show, one can see Picasso's passions wax and wane, as new love generates new painting styles. Olga is reduced to an animalistic abstraction, a hard-edged monster with a jagged screaming mouth; Marie-Therese is a floating dream of lavender curves and post-coital sensuality, the decorative apotheosis of the Surrealist unconscious. The beautiful, intensely intelligent, increasingly distraught Dora Maar inspired an angular style that gives Expressionism a Cubist infrastructure and recalls the vibrant striations of the \"Demoiselles\" period.    Occasionally the main characters meet: in the astounding drawing \"Murder\" of 1934, a fleshy version of Olga's \"screaming head,\" now equipped with giant rotting teeth and pinwheel arms, plunges a butcher knife into a sketchier victim who has the rounded tell-tale profile of Marie-Therese. Needless to say, the implications of biography are so heavy in the air here that one can almost hear screenplays and story treatments chugging out of fax machines all over Hollywood.   For anyone deeply interested in painting, this show is a fascinating exegesis on the medium's ways and means, a series of themes and variations -- and more variations -- based on the female body and face. It is also an invaluable commentary on form following feeling, which highlights Picasso's powers of invention and reinvention. And surreptitiousness: in \"Guitar Hanging on a Wall\" (1927) he covertly acknowledges his new relationship with Marie-Therese by showing her shadowlike profile surveying their linked initials, with hers being arranged to suggest a body with open legs.    There are a few instances of startling ineptness, like the awkward forms and heavy-handed surface of \"Bust of a Woman,\" in which a screaming head appears to bite a black, Malevichian painting. More frequent are moments of blissful beauty: a small painting of Marie-Therese in which her weightless lavender body is dotted with colored circles that may be the most delectable spinning spheres in painting since van Gogh's \"Starry Night.\" And from 1937 and '38, when Picasso was dividing his time between Dora Maar and Marie-Therese, there is a series of images of the latter depicted in the angular style usually reserved for the former.    Best of all are the images that form the core of the show: the drawings and paintings of weeping women that were a byproduct of Picasso's studies for \"Guernica.\" In her essay, Ms. Freeman meticulously delineates the various signs and devices Picasso developed to convey human features under stress. Prominent among these are eyes shaped like teardrops, storm-tossed boats or liquid-spilling saucers; tears that hang from eyes like long nails or narrow cascading waterfalls. Nostrils, ears, tongues, teeth, fingers, fingernails and even handkerchiefs: every detail is manipulated to maximum effect, usually to convey double meanings, always to give the convulsions of grief an almost architectural grandeur and an emotional reality beyond realism.   Finally, for Picasso aficianados, both professional and amateur, this show has inside baseball to die for, most of it hiding in plain sight. As much as Picasso himself, its inadvertent subject is the conflict between the old and the new guard of Picasso scholarship. If one takes the time to read Ms. Freeman's essay and compare it with the works and wall texts in the show, one discovers a substantial discrepancy between her thoughts about Picasso and the thoughts of William S. Lieberman, chairman of the Metropolitan's 20th-century department and a veteran of many Picasso projects and exhibitions, who enlarged and reshaped this show for its Met appearance.   (Mr. Lieberman seems to have other disagreements as well. Picasso's 1923 \"Woman in White,\" displayed just outside the entrance to the exhibition, is listed in its brochure under the heading \"Prologue: Olga Picasso,\" despite a recent article by the art historian William Rubin arguing that the painting is a portrait of the 1920's socialite Sara Murphy.)   It is difficult to assess what Ms. Freeman's show accomplished in its original version, especially since the publication that accompanies the show is more a freestanding book than a catalogue and reproduces about 135 Picassos, of which only 40 were actually shown in Los Angeles. But her essay clearly intends to set Picasso's motif of the weeping woman against a backdrop that extends beyond the confines of love, infidelity and individual personality.    Her thesis, while not entirely new, is that Picasso's images of weeping women were not inspired by the anguish he caused Marie-Therese or Dora Maar, but by his own anguish about the Spanish Civil War and its slaughter of innocent civilians. This approach makes the victimization of women less completely central to Picasso's greatness, and places that greatness in a less isolated, more historical context. (Ms. Freeman also reproduces works made by Julio Gonzalez and Joan Miro for the Spanish Pavilion that involved the motif of women in distress.)   Also implicit in Ms. Freeman's treatment is the possibility that the tragedy of the war, especially after the bombing of Guernica, moved Picasso to create an image of female suffering that was deeper and more sympathetic and humane than the animalistic screaming head of Olga, one that he blended with the features of Dora Maar and Marie-Therese.    Mr. Lieberman has more than doubled the number of works exhibited, often by adding rather conventionally realistic prints or drawings of Picasso's wife and mistresses. Some additions are simply eccentric, if not a bit malicious. He opens the show with \"Woman's Arm,\" a little-known sculpture of a clenched fist that Picasso made in 1951 and, more bizarrely, ends it with a 1962 linocut of Jacqueline Picasso, as if to remind us of the last weeping woman in Picasso's life. More interesting are the additions of two dark paintings of Dora Maar from 1942, in which abstracted animalistic features recall Olga's screaming head and suggest that the humanizing effect that began with the studies for \"Guernica\" did not last.   Mr. Lieberman's additions give us more to look at, but they also tend to soften and blur the show's focus, diminishing the prominence of the weeping-women images and reinstating the more conventional lover-by-lover treatment that Ms. Freeman wants to revise. Still, it's hard to complain too energetically. Together, Ms. Freeman's book and Mr. Lieberman's version of her show form a kind of two-for-one bargain that, in the end, gives everyone more to think about, adding a note of curatorial tension that is not out of place in this dramatic exhibition.    \"Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar\" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, through Sept. 4. It is sponsored by Paine Webber.

Can a clergyman be far away? In Thaddeus O'Sullivan's 1990 film \"December Bride,\" the local minister is indeed troubled by this domestic arrangement, as is practically everyone who lives nearby. The time is turn of the century, and it is the minister's job to point out that this living arrangement violates the rules of the community. Sarah (Saskia Reeves), the quiet but shockingly bold heroine of the title, simply ignores him. She thinks some rules are made to be broken.   Repression and rebellion are constantly at war throughout the films in a new, landmark series exploring the full range of Irish cinema. In the Name of the Nation: Celebrating Irish Film Making 1910-1994, which begins today and will run through July 7 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, explores an astonishing variety of similar tensions. These dramas are often played out against rugged, lonely landscapes of extraordinary natural beauty, and acted by a small circle of fine Irish actors whose work has been seen elsewhere, but not to such obvious advantage. The great appeal of this series rests on both academic interest and entertainment value.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940610","headline":"Slain Rwanda Bishops Had Urged Peace Talks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/world/slain-rwanda-bishops-had-urged-peace-talks.html","abstract":"  Two months before they died, the three Catholic bishops killed in Rwanda on Wednesday joined in an impassioned plea for peace negotiations between Government forces and the rebels who were reported to have committed the killing.    \"The Catholic bishops of Rwanda urge the Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front to avoid the logic of war to settle their disputes,\" the Rwandan Catholic Bishops' Conference said in an appeal in April, after the eruption of ethnic killing in the Central African country. \"May they do everything possible to stop the bloody troubles in some parts of the country so that they do not consume the rest of the country.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940610","headline":"Jays Take First Step In Pursuit Of Yanks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/sports/baseball-jays-take-first-step-in-pursuit-of-yanks.html","abstract":"  After all the challenges the Blue Jays have overcome in winning the last two World Series, the notion that they must prove themselves two months into this season seems ludicrous.

There was urgency in the voices of some Jays players before they played the first-place Yankees. Molitor was especially articulate about chasing the Yankees because he knows the season has passed the one-third point and these four games against the Yankees could invigorate Toronto.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940610","headline":"1944:Allies Take Viterbo : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/opinion/IHT-1944allies-take-viterbo-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WITH THE 5TH ARMY AT VITERBO, Italy - [From our New York edition:] Viterbo and Tarquinia fell today [June 9] to spearheads of the 5th Army thrusting northward toward Florence and Livorno against very light resistance.

It's silly to assert that someone who dies from smoking-induced problems at 65 is more expensive to society than a nonsmoker who dies at 85 from coronary disease. The difference is longevity, not cost, and the question is when, not if, we will be a medical expense. Alzheimer's disease is no less expensive than lung cancer.

But those moods are expressed largely through the kind of jagged, quirky, off-balance partnering for which Mr. Martins is known as a choreographer.

After the 18th century, it was usually staged in condensed versions, which is what the Taiwan-based Lan Ting Chinese Opera Troupe did on Thursday night at the Taipei Theater (1221 Avenue of the Americas, between 48th and 49th Streets). So intriguing and lovely was this abridged example of the kun-qu style, however, that I almost wished for a Chinese counterpart to Bayreuth, so such works could be seen in their entirety.   Presumably this opera would then be shown to be a hypnotic, languorously unfolding fantasy about Du Liniang, a young woman who, despite being isolated by a jealous father, finds her true love in the person of a young scholar. The distinctive Chinese turn in this archetypal tale is that the scholar appears to her only in a dream. She dies out of love for the imagined figure, but the Lord of the Underworld allows her to return to earth and seek him in the flesh. Much else would happen over the course of several days of dramaturgy, but after a while, I imagine, the minutely chronicled emotional life of the heroine would take on a mythic character while the sinuous lyricism of this ancient musical style would coax one into a dream state not unlike her own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940611","headline":"China Explodes H-Bomb in Underground Test","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/world/china-explodes-h-bomb-in-underground-test.html","abstract":"  China exploded a hydrogen bomb today as part of a series of underground tests aimed at modernizing its nuclear forces before test ban negotiations are concluded by 1996.
