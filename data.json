With Verdi or Wagner operas, one might quibble about editions and details, but the composers' fully orchestrated scores are solid foundations on which performances can be built. But with Monteverdi and his contemporaries, surviving scores present the music in shorthand, with instrumentation and scoring niceties left to circumstance, and fragments of competing versions clouding the picture. The questions \"What should be done here?\" and \"How?\" can be daunting for musicians used to being guided by the composers' expressed wishes.    The student singers and musicians of the Juilliard Opera Center have been puzzling over Monteverdi's 1642 opera, \"L'Incoronazione di Poppea,\" with musicological prodding from Gary Wedow (who, in turn, based his realization on Alan Curtis's 1990 edition of the work) and staging by Frank Corsaro.

The Stars' third power-play goal of the game came with the Blues' Petr Nedved in the penalty box for holding. Cavallini took a shot that deflected off the Blues' Brendan Shanahan but he got the puck right back and beat Curtis Joseph with 40-foot drive for his first goal of the playoffs. Cavallini, a former Blues player, added a second-period assist and has a goal and five assists in the series. The Stars, who won despite getting outshot by 48-31, go for the sweep in Game 4 tomorrow night in St. Louis. (AP) GYMNASTICS  Miller Wins World All-Around Title  Shannon Miller of the United States completed two spectacular vaults tonight to win her second straight women's all-around title at the world gymnastics championships, in Brisbane, Australia. Miller needed to score 9.775 with her two vaults to win, and she scored 9.812. She totaled 39.274 points for the four disciplines in retaining the title she won last year at Birmingham, England. It was a remarkable performance considering that Miller, 17, from Edmond, Okla., injured a stomach muscle last month and missed two weeks of training. Lavinia Milosovici of Romania won the silver medal with a score of 39.236, 0.038 behind. Dina Kochetkova of Russia was third at 39.125.

A few weeks ago it put on a catastrophic blues program, a misguided collection of players and pejorative ideas about blues that indicated those in charge didn't have much of a grasp of who is capable of what in the jazz world. Not a good thing for a jazz series. Then along comes Thursday night's concert, \"The New Legacy,\" which did what the jazz program has done best: introduce unheralded, talented arrangers; allow gifted improvisers room to sell their wares, and let a fine big band roar.   The show was meant to pair young musicians with older ones, and it opened with \"New Orleans Joy,\" a piece by the trumpeter and arranger Randy Sandke that brought together four tunes loosely associated with the city of the title. He was joined by three other trumpeters, Doc Cheatham, Nicholas Payton and Jon Faddis. Mr. Sandke is one of the more miscast musicians working in jazz. He's often written off, unfairly, as a swing revivalist. But he can play virtually any jazz idiom, and as an arranger he brought modernist dissonances, bitter and astringent, to the piece. He also flashed lush reed writing, and roiling, shouting polyphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"New York:Spring Brings Out The Buyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/your-money/IHT-new-yorkspring-brings-out-the-buyers.html","abstract":"TAKE THE real-estate broker's maxim, \"Location, location, location.\" Add to that, \"Bigger is better\" and you have a snapshot of where the current action is in Manhattan's apartment market..A glance at a recent survey of co-op apartme","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Faces Turned to Crimson; Strike at Harvard Club Is Embarrassing, at the Least","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/nyregion/faces-turned-to-crimson-strike-at-harvard-club-is-embarrassing-at-the-least.html","abstract":"  Predictability is a cherished hallmark of a good city club.

You say that this \"innocent-sounding\" provision would undermine cost and quality controls. The truth is that these provisions are essential to protect quality of care.   You assume insurance companies are interested in providing cost-effective, good-quality care. My experience as a practicing psychologist tells me otherwise. Insurance companies are indeed motivated to minimize costs (that is, benefits paid out) -- this increases profits. But they have no incentive to maximize quality -- that often costs money. The result is that they often exclude highly trained and experienced providers who they think may prescribe more expensive treatment, and allow in mediocre practitioners who they think will be more compliant with the company's wish to save money. Similarly, \"medical necessity,\" the standard by which the companies determine whether to pay for treatment, is generally defined in a highly restrictive and self-serving way. In mental health treatment, the area with which I am familiar, brief, inexpensive and inadequate treatment is often all that is approved, when more extensive treatment is necessary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Homes for Gnomes, in Country Gardens and Suburbia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/style/IHT-homes-for-gnomes-in-country-gardens-and-suburbia.html","abstract":"Hey ho!

People are pulled from cars and buses, ordered to show their identity papers and then killed on the spot if they belong to the wrong ethnic group. Thousands of bodies have already piled up, and the killing continues despite the presence of 1,700 United Nations peacekeepers. The wider horror is that the world has few ways of responding effectively when violence within a nation leads to massacres and the breakdown of civil order.    The U.N. Security Council threw in the bloodied towel when it decided unanimously Thursday to cut back the blue-helmeted force to 270 soldiers in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. However morally unsettling, the pullout fairly reflects the unwillingness of most U.N. members to recruit a force big enough to stop a genocidal conflict. Most troubling of all is the uncertain fate of thousands of Rwandans who sought the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Review/Music; Meeting With the Many Beethovens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/arts/review-music-meeting-with-the-many-beethovens.html","abstract":"  Behind our image of Beethoven the architect stand others: Beethoven the obsessed, for example, and Beethoven the slightly mad. The Fantasia (Op. 77), with which Ursula Oppens began her Carnegie Hall piano recital on Wednesday night, has indeed a hallucinogenic quality, a kind of inspired incoherence that achieves direction only with considerable time and effort on the composer's part.   A swooping scale; silence (what to do next?); lyrical snippets; nervous syncopated repetitions; disjointed key changes; more of all the above, again and again. The five stalwart sharps of B major rescue us at the end as Beethoven arrives at his other lifelong obsession, the theme and variations form.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Aid Sought For Jailing Illegal Aliens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/us/aid-sought-for-jailing-illegal-aliens.html","abstract":"  President Clinton asked Congress today to appropriate $350 million to help states pay the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of felonies.

So a Broadway version to which all the nonsense has been added raises a few questions. For whom is this show really intended? Can its live action rival the film's flawless animation? How will it play for children, who were after all the audience that made \"Beauty and the Beast\" a hit? And what if those children only have milk money, not the $65 needed for a seat in the orchestra?   Bear in mind that a family outing for four can cost $260 -- maybe more, if you don't make it past the $45 sweatshirts and $20 audiocassettes at the souvenir stand. Can this experience possibly be worth 13 times as much as a \"Beauty and the Beast\" videotape, which also happens to be the more enduring purchase? Believe me, even a 5-year-old can do the arithmetic on that one, especially a 5-year-old who loves the film. And Broadway's \"Beauty and the Beast\" can count on a lot of stiff criticism within the one-digit age bracket, which constitutes most of the presold audience for this extravaganza. They may be small, but they know the movie by heart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"HILLARY CLINTON TAKES QUESTIONS ON WHITEWATER","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/us/the-whitewater-affair-the-overview-hillary-clinton-takes-questions-on-whitewater.html","abstract":"  Moving to silence her critics, Hillary Rodham Clinton held a highly unusual news conference today in which she offered a calm and determined explanation of her financial dealings and an apology for the way the White House has handled questions about them.

Naipaul are an interlocking series of journeys. The longest and the most difficult was his first. In 1950, just before he turned 18, he ventured from the New World to the Old World, from Trinidad, where he was born -- the grandson of emigres from India -- to England, where he had a scholarship at Oxford University. Eventually he became a writer with a world perspective, and he has never stopped traveling. These travels have inspired 22 books of fiction, history and commentary. At 61, Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul is a self-remade man, a distinguished man of letters with a penetrating view of life, and of his life, as a source for literature. As he says: \"One isn't born one's self. One is born with a mass of expectations, a mass of other people's ideas -- and you have to work through it all.\"   For Mr. Naipaul, his new book, \"A Way in the World\" (to be published next month), is, in the Proustian phrase, a \"pilgrimage of the heart.\" It represents the author's search for selfhood and for an understanding of the effects of inheritance. In this highly personalized narrative, he looks back at his books and relives the creative process in a new form. \"A Way in the World\" is, he says, \"a settling of accounts for me with myself,\" for what he regards as errors of artistic judgment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Connecticut Q&A;: Michael B.

They are hoping to duplicate that success today. Their needs are many -- wide receiver, backup running back, defensive back -- but since this isn't fantasy football, they can only make one selection with that 24th pick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Streetscapes/The Walker Town House; The Grand Mansion of an Early Black Entrepreneur","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/realestate/streetscapes-walker-town-house-grand-mansion-early-black-entrepreneur.html","abstract":"  UNDER Laurie Beckelman, its chairwoman, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission has emphasized looking in the city's residential neighborhoods for buildings of architectural or historic merit.

The most sweeping of the four proposals being floated is endorsed by the Florida Hotel and Motel Association and would grant each of the state's 67 counties the right to choose among any combination of freestanding casinos and casinos in hotels, riverboats and parimutuel facilities. The campaign to pass a constitutional amendment authorizing gaming picked up momentum after the Florida Legislature defeated similar legislation during its annual 60-day session, which ended earlier this month.

Given Eisenman's stature, the oversight is startling but symbolically apt. For a quarter of a century, it has been this architect's fate -- more accurately, his chosen path -- to remain just slightly beyond the pale.   Obsessed by his place in history but terrified of being pigeonholed, at once covetous and contemptuous of public acceptance, Eisenman, 61, has made a career out of his alienation from conventional practice. While scarcely an obscure figure, he has attained prominence within the profession by cultivating the impression that he remains outside it, claiming that his work amounts to a sustained critique of what the rest of the profession is up to. This despite the fact that in the past few years Eisenman has completed or begun a small city's worth of major commissions, including a convention center and an art museum in Columbus, Ohio; two office buildings in Tokyo; a design school in Cincinnati; a theater complex in Atlanta; and a 40-acre housing and commercial development in Frankfurt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/connecticut-guide-851108.html","abstract":"  DARROW DELIGHTS   Since 1933, when his first cartoon was published in The New Yorker, Whitney Darrow has extracted chuckles and guffaws from millions of people who then looked forward to the next of his more than 1,500 drawings.

Along these roads, temples and rest houses were built for the travelers who wanted to worship the gods and sleep comfortably afterward. In northeastern Thailand, two such Khmer temples, Phimai and Phanom Rung, survive. The first of these was begun perhaps as early as the 11th century; both were certainly completed before 1200.   Because of their distance from the capital, the temples are relatively small, but they are handsome nonetheless. And there are few tourists: During my two visits over the last year, there were several groups of Thai schoolchildren at Phanom Rung; very few visitors at all at Phimai. Conveniently, both can be visited in a day's excursion from Korat (also known as Nakhon Ratchasima, which is the name, too, of the province of which this is the main city). The drive through the Thai countryside is picturesque, passing by villages of houses on stilts, a fair complement of water buffaloes, occasional banyans and flame trees, and providing views over the Korat plateau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Law-Abiding Americans Find Reason to Laud Singapore Justice; Celebrity Awaits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/opinion/l-law-abiding-americans-find-reason-to-laud-singapore-justice-celebrity-awaits-883786.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   One thing your April 10 editorial doesn't mention is what will happen when Michael Fay is returned to the United States.

In the likely event the agent wanted to sell airline tickets, a certification would be needed, but it is from an industry clearinghouse, the Airlines Reporting Corporation.    Rhode Island is the one state now requiring an examination; 10 other states place some minimal legal requirement on the sale of travel: California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia and Washington.

Apart from their programmatic aspects -- a narration invoking a black childhood in the 1940's in Donald E. Dillard's \"Childhood Scenes\"; references to a Caribbean island in Daniel Roumain's \"Haitian Essay,\" a musical allusion to blacks who worked at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago in Dolores White's \"Celebration\" -- the pieces were simply examples of various American styles, executed with varying degrees of expertise. Whiffs of jazz and blues and Haitian folk tunes could be heard, but neither these works nor the fourth piece -- Jonathan B. Holland's \"Martha's Waltz,\" inspired by Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" -- attested to a hyphenated identity. At times it seemed that their composers and the others at the symposium were unified only by their apparent lack of interest in black pop culture.   Defining a black American musical tradition for the concert hall was one of the symposium's preoccupations, and it was difficult not to sense that this tradition is now tenuous. Although blacks continue to play crucial roles in jazz, blues, gospel, hip-hop and other popular styles, fewer than 2 percent of orchestral musicians and perhaps only a few dozen classical composers are black. But as Eileen Southern's distinguished work \"The Music of Black Americans\" shows, a long history of black involvement with the concert hall precedes contemporary affirmative action programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Sports, Money, Politics -- A special report.; New Jersey's Sports Empire: New Fields, Hard Times","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/sports-money-politics-special-report-new-jersey-s-sports-empire-new-fields-hard.html","abstract":"  The Meadowlands sports complex, rising from swamps and garbage dumps 20 years ago, was a perfect antidote to New Jersey's image as a second-rate place with smelly air and dirty politics.

The landscape proved highly inspirational to Wordsworth, who took most of his poetic cues from nature. Living with his sister, and surrounded by a circle of poets and writers that included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Robert Southey and, later, Thomas De Quincey, Wordsworth enjoyed his most creative years. HOME AT GRASMERE: The Wordsworths and the Lakes (Collins & Brown/Trafalgar Square, $29.95) chronicles this period. Penelope Hughes-Hallett, the author of \"Jane Austen: 'My Dear Cassandra,' \" winds the story around excerpts from William Wordsworth's poems, as well as passages from Dorothy Wordsworth's journals and other letters and writings. She demonstrates that Wordsworth frequently borrowed from his sister's lyrical observations of nature and of the rustic characters who roamed the countryside. William, however, consistently underplayed Dorothy's contribution to his work. Ms. Hughes-Hallett's story, lavishly illustrated in watercolors that capture the extraordinary beauty of the Lake District, offers a glimpse into Dorothy's fanatic devotion to her brother, including her heartache over his marriage. The book is most enticing in its presentation of personal turmoil and tragedy: Coleridge's long addiction to alcohol and drugs, the misunderstandings that wrecked the close relationship between Wordsworth and Coleridge, the deaths in 1812 of two of Wordsworth's children, and, finally, Dorothy's madness. \nCLAUDIA RICCI","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Knicks Surrender Playoff Advantage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-surrender-playoff-advantage.html","abstract":"  After a long regular season in which they faced many obstacles, the Knicks were helpless this afternoon, watching television as two other teams decided their playoff fate.

Available just in the last two weeks to buyers in the United States, the Discovery follows a trend among luxury auto makers, including Mercedes and BMW (which recently bought Rover), to offer vehicles under $30,000 for so-called value-conscious buyers. While Rover's best-known product, the Range Rover, costs upward of $52,000, the slightly smaller Discovery starts at a mere $28,900. That price makes it competitive with other luxury compact sport utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee.   WHERE IT'S BUILT TO BE DRIVEN: The highway, of course, plus everywhere you don't drive your Accord -- through the river, over the woods, across construction sites when no workers or police officers are around. Land-Rovers are engineered to be supreme off-road vehicles. The Discovery's promoters say it can climb 45-degree angles and ford streams almost 20 inches deep. Yank a lever in the very manly center console and you double the pulling power of the V-8 engine; jerk another lever and you lock the differential, to keep power flowing equally to all wheels when you're plowing through deep mud or snow.
