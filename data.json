They have determined that a compound in the male's semen is toxic to the female, and that over the long run (which, by fly standards, means a few weeks), the ingredient significantly shortens her life.

Less obvious is that the defense budget is full of trap doors set to spring open in the future with unpleasantly expensive consequences.    One of those trap doors is the deferral of major weapons purchases until 1998, which is designed to make current and near-term spending levels seem more reasonable and to hide the ultimate costs of new weapons already under development or soon to start.

With a catalogue that includes \"The Way We Were,\" \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" and the underappreciated score for \"Yentl,\" they are the most important lyricists still writing movie songs in a pre-rock style. Attesting to their success was Mrs. Bergman's recent election to head the board of Ascap.    Opening the 25th season of the 92d Street Y's popular Lyrics and Lyricists series on Sunday afternoon, the Bergmans were the hosts of an extensive retrospective of their work. For nearly three hours, the Y's main auditorium resounded with the billowing Technicolor ballads of love and longing that make up the bulk of their output.

Speaking recently by telephone from his Los Angeles home, Mr. Wonder, one of pop's most enduring performers and writers of love songs, concluded his comments about Boyz II Men with the non sequitur, \"I just want to ban handguns: that's my thing.\" And when talking about the House of Blues club in Los Angeles, he stopped his anecdote short to muse about Newt Gingrich.    In addition to having a musical career that dates back to when he was a 12-year-old signed to Motown records, Mr. Wonder, who is 44, has a long resume as a political crusader. So it makes sense that Mr. Wonder's latest tour (his first in the United States since 1988) is not to promote a new album, but a new charity. The tour, a benefit and food drive for the Charge Against Hunger campaign of American Express, was at Madison Square Garden last night and will return tonight.

That was made boisterously clear on Monday night at the opening of his big, fine, tragicomic new melodrama, \"Seven Guitars,\" at the Goodman Theater here.  From its mysterious and funny opening scene, which is actually a prologue, until its haunted conclusion, the play runs approximately three hours. Yet \"Seven Guitars\" seldom loses momentum. It displays a narrative sweep and an almost biblical richness of language and character that distinguish Mr. Wilson from virtually all other contemporary American playwrights.   His most singular gift: the ability to astonish his audiences and to find laughter in tales that, you know from the start, are not funny at all, at least in terms of conventional theater. In the past, this Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist (\"Fences,\" \"The Piano Lesson\") has been compared to Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller.

Belatedly, Mr. Solomon, an upstate New York Republican and the new chairman of the House Rules Committee, abandoned his embarrassing decision to hang a portrait of former Representative Howard (Judge) Smith of Virginia in the committee room.    Mr. Smith, one of Congress's most notorious bigots, used his chairmanship in the 1950's and 60's to impede civil rights legislation. Mr. Solomon had taken down a portrait of the late Claude Pepper, a noble Florida legislator, to clear the way for a man whose memory is without honor in his own region. Mr. Solomon's elevation of this arch-segregationist was more than poor judgment. It was an insult to Mr. Solomon's constituents and New York's role as a leader in civil rights.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950125","headline":"1920: Delay Expires : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/opinion/IHT-1920-delay-expires-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - The four days' delay given to the Yugo-Slavs to state definitely whether they accept or refuse the compromise adopted by the Council of Three as a settlement of the Adriatic problem has expired.

Webern, far more than Schoenberg or even Berg, was the master colorist of the Second Viennese School. A few string pizzicatos, low sustained tones on the woodwind, high muted cries from the brass, scattered notes on the harp or mandolin: these accumulate into a pointillistic picture of pure, shimmering sound.    Webern died 50 years ago, killed accidentally outside his Austrian home by an American soldier. This year's Focus Festival at Juilliard celebrates both the composer and his musical legacy; the weeklong series began on Friday with a concert by the Juilliard Orchestra at Alice Tully Hall. Thanks to Webern's famous concision, the festival will include nearly all of his works, excepting only a few early songs and brief unpublished orchestral pieces.  There is plenty of room left over for composers who felt his powerful influence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950125","headline":"Cutting Terrorists' Support","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/world/cutting-terrorists-support.html","abstract":"  The United States took steps to prevent the flow of funds from Americans to terrorist groups in Israel and elsewhere.

Since the latest deaths, mostly of young soldiers, he has made \"separation\" a clarion call and says his Government will start as early as next week to figure out how to do it.

Bill Clinton is plainly aware how hard it is going to be to regain his footing. He cannot simply offer himself as a watered-down Newt Gingrich.

The others consisted mainly of limp warnings to Republicans not to pass irresponsible welfare programs or constitutional amendments.   The minimum-wage proposal is worth fighting for. It would fulfill the President's campaign pledge to make work pay -- by which he meant that full-time workers should earn enough to raise their families out of poverty. Mr. Clinton said he would let Congress write a minimum-wage bill and decide how much the rate should be raised, a strategy reaffirmed by his aides today.

This punishing provision, which deprives these residents of a safety net their own tax dollars helped build, did not sit well even with many Republicans. So Nancy Kassebaum, head of the Senate committee overseeing welfare, and several House G.O.P. members have come up with a novel way to avoid internal party squabbling: Congress would turn the whole issue over to the states, letting them decide which poor residents deserve assistance.   Their solution, unfortunately, is not really a solution at all, however benign it may appear on the surface. The reason is that in time the states themselves may decide to let legal immigrants fall through the net. In addition, the solution makes no sense in terms of the normal division of labor between states and the Federal Government.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950126","headline":"Positive Budget Input : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/26/opinion/IHT-positive-budget-input-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Despite the political and editorial fury about the U.S. budget deficit, I have yet to read mention of the millions of newly employed Americans who presumably are now paying income tax.
