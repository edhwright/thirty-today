Eleven inspectors were arrested yesterday when they reported to the Buildings Department for what they had been told would be a computer training session. Colleagues looked on in disbelief as the inspectors were taken away about 9:30 A.M. One plumbing inspector who was not arrested said the city was partly responsible for the problem.   \"They create it,\" the inspector said. \"They put you in a position that basically is a no-win situation. They don't give you any increase in salary. Plumbers are making $55,000 a year and the city plumbing inspectors only get $28,000.\" Payoffs at 88 Work Sites    The inspectors, responsible for insuring that pipes, sprinklers and gas lines are safe in buildings being constructed or under renovation, were accused of taking dozens of payoffs and bribes from contractors since 1988, ranging from $50 to $1,000. Prosecutors said they had evidence of payoffs at 88 work sites, including Police Headquarters, the World Trade Center, a condominium development on Staten Island and a row of three-family houses in Queens.    For the bribes, prosecutors said, the inspectors speeded approvals for plumbing work, arranging special appointments for inspections and taking pains to make sure the paper work was done quickly. Because plumbing contractors are generally not paid until their work passes inspection, the contractors were willing to make illegal payments just to speed up the city bureaucracy, prosecutors said.   \"These city inspectors were demanding payoffs to insure that their official duties were performed expeditiously,\" said the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau. \"Their power to extort payoffs lay in the fact that their signatures made the difference between getting paid or not getting paid.\"   The city's Investigation Commissioner, Susan E. Shepard, portrayed the bribes as part of endemic corruption in the plumbing industry. She said plumbing contractors had come to expect that they would have to pay cash bribes to get city inspections done on time and without hassles. Since the plumbing inspectors are required to be licensed plumbers, most come from the companies they regulate, creating a cozy breeding ground for corruption, she said. 'A Real Fraternity'    \"There is a real fraternity here,\" she said. \"A fraternity that practices corruption almost as an art form. Corruption so deeply ingrained it has become common practice. No guns pointed. No strong-arm enforcement. People pay. The contractor gets his sign-off. The job continues. Everyone smiles.\"   About half of the city's 38 plumbing investigators were arrested in the sweep yesterday, crippling the department's ability to perform inspections. In addition to 11 inspectors arrested at the department's headquarters, one was arrested at his office and five others were still being sought. Six retired inspectors were arrested at their homes.   It was not the first time that corruption has cropped up in a building inspection program. In 1991, a similar investigation resulted in the arrest of 14 construction inspectors in the Buildings Department on Federal charges of extorting more than $150,000 over a three-year period from contractors. In 1992, city investigators arrested 30 taxi inspectors at the city's cab inspection center in Queens on charges that they accepted bribes to pass unsafe taxis.   The inspectors arrested yesterday were charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, extortion, receiving bribes and receiving unlawful gratuities. The most serious charge, grand larceny, carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.    Ms. Shepard said the 18-month inquiry uncovered no evidence that the inspectors overlooked or approved work that would create hazards.   Among those indicted were the chief plumbing inspectors for Queens and Brooklyn and the acting chief inspector in Manhattan, Ms. Shepard said. The chiefs were paid between $300 and $500 per inspection and in a single instance, $1,000, for a fast approval, augmenting their income by as much as $25,000 a year, she said. The assistant inspectors and line inspectors were collecting about $5,000 a year in illegal payments, she said.   Mayor David N. Dinkins said he had submitted two bills to the City Council that would replace city-paid inspectors with private inspectors supervised by a board of city officials. He also said the Buildings Department had taken some steps to discourage corruption: computerizing inspection schedules to make sure the sites are visited within three days after a request and rotating inspectors from borough to borough to break down personal relationships with plumbing contractors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931001","headline":"Welfare Fingerprinting Becomes Law in Suffolk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/nyregion/welfare-fingerprinting-becomes-law-in-suffolk.html","abstract":"  Despite possible state opposition, Suffolk County Executive Robert J.

Derice, the bald-headed Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) and Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) have all crossed paths, quite literally, in the Olympic trials for Jamaican runners. And they have lost their chance to qualify as runners.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931001","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/style/chronicle-362693.html","abstract":"  Twenty-five years ago, JOHN WALL, an assistant United States attorney in Boston, prosecuted Dr. BENJAMIN SPOCK, the Rev.

Giuliani, followed by a series of unflattering black and white photos of Mr. Giuliani. As a male narrator's voice is heard over ominous music, blocks of text scroll on the screen repeating his words. At the end, a final question freezes on the screen, with a big picture of Mr. Giuliani and a small picture of Mayor David N. Dinkins, noting his campaign paid for the ad. PRODUCER   Doak Shrum Harris Carrier Devine of Washington. THE SCRIPT   Narrator: \"He was the third-highest official in Washington of the Reagan Justice Department that led an attack on the environment, tried to overturn a woman's right to choose, and turn back the clock on civil rights. He opposed banning cop killer bullets, waffled on gun control, and supported Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. As U.S. Attorney in New York, of the 146 people he hired, only 15 were Latino or black. He was accused of abuse of power, and Federal courts rebuked his conduct. Rudolph Giuliani: Can we elect a man who's fought against everything we stand for. ACCURACY   Mr. Giuliani was the Associate Attorney General, the No. 3 post in Justice, in the early Regan Administration, and the department was widely criticized on the issues the ad cites. In 1983, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee against a ban on armor-piercing bullets, arguing that it was impossible to cover all kinds capable of penetrating a bullet-proof vest \"without being overinclusive,\" and proposed instead mandatory five-year sentences for the use of such bullets in the commission of Federal crimes. In 1981, he called proposed gun-control laws that would impose waiting periods for handgun purchases \"sensible and moderate\" but more recently has said gun control laws are not especially effective. Roughly 10 percent of the laywers Mr. Giuliani hired as United States Attorney in Manhattan were black or Hispanic, comparable to the hiring in the city's Law Department at the time but roughly one-third the average level of hiring there since Mr. Dinkins took office. Many defense lawyers accused Mr. Giuliani of excessive zeal in his years as United States Attorney, Federal judges several times cited him or his office for \"overzealousness\" and some of his most celebrated prosecutions ended in acquittals or reversals on appeal. SCORECARD   This ad, unusually pointed for a low-key politician like Mr. Dinkins, is part of his campaign's continuing effort to paint Mr. Giuliani as a hard-hearted Reaganaut, unyielding and out of step with the liberal swing voters who are likely to help decide the election. It spans issues that have long been liberal touchstones. Virtually all the stands it cites predated the 1989 mayoral campaign, and were issues four years ago, but the Mayor's camp argues that Mr. Giuliani's record is little known or understood by most New Yorkers and must be attacked. The intent of the ad is to make the whole of Mr. Giuliani's sometimes shifting stands greater than the sum of its parts, though voters may find some of his past positions only marginally relevant to the next Mayor's job.

And it's still trying to clinch the deal.   What has held up the sale is the British Government's refusal to grant an export license.

Lawyers for some of the surviving Branch Davidians were quick to predict that the Treasury review's general depiction of Government failures, confusion and lies would bolster the Branch Davidians' case that bullets fired by cult members during the shootout came in self-defense.

Established as a writer of novels, short stories and plays, Mr. Thomas became a television celebrity in the 1960's on the BBC talk show \"The Brains Trust.\" That's when this dramatization begins, with Anthony Hopkins grumblingly playing the wittily provocative Thomas. \"All writers are liars,\" he declares, explaining that the lie is a compulsory social tactic.

Wales.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19931001","time":"1993-10-01

The teams' records are in parentheses. P.S.A.L.  Sheepshead Bay (2-0) at Lafayette (1-2) Key Players: Both teams feature a ball-control offense and rely on hard-hitting defensive units. \"Brooklyn football is like the Midwest,\" said Sheepshead Bay Coach Dick Reilly. \"It's bang-bang football.\" Lafayette's linemen may have trouble moving defensive end Elvis Abellard (19 tackles) and Company off the ball, as the Frenchies are significantly smaller than the Skippers up front. Lafayette will probably have to throw the ball to create running lanes. Sheepshead Bay features a more balanced attack, as Michael Reilly, the coach's son, is a smart quarterback with an accurate arm to complement the fine running combination of Kwesi Daniels and Joe Coffey. Daniels received Sheepshead Bay's game ball last week after rushing for 145 yards on 18 carries and 1 touchdown in the 15-14 victory over Curtis. Daniels also registered 15 tackles and 2 sacks as a linebacker.  Comment: Lafayette has won the last two meetings against Sheepshead Bay in the closing seconds. Lafayette defeated the Skippers, 13-6, last year and by 19-17 in 1991. \"Those are the ones that put the white back into your beard,\" said Reilly, Sheepshead Bay's coach.  Lehman (1-1) at South Shore (0-2) Key Players: What South Shore quarterback Adrian Nazario lacks in size (5 foot 5 inches, and 150 pounds), he makes up in heart. \"He's a tough kid,\" said Coach Stan Feldman. \"He gets knocked down and he pops right back up. He's our leader.\" Nonetheless, the Vikings' offense still depends on the running of Tracey McDonald, Carlos Cromwell and Dwayne Bennett. Lehman needs Robert Talley to rebound from last week's 30-7 loss to Canarsie, in which he was limited to 27 yards rushing on 10 carries.  Comment: South Shore has yet to score a point this season, losing by 26-0 in its opener against Curtis and by 20-0 to Lincoln. \"I'm really proud of the boys,\" said Feldman. \"They haven't given up, and they've been gung-ho in practice.\"  C.H.S.F.L.  Spellman (2-1) at St. John the Baptist (3-0) Key Players: St. John the Baptist's offense is ranked No. 1 in the A Division, averaging 271.3 yards a game. Eric Martin (31 of 55 for 533 yards, 5 touchdowns, 1 interception), who is the division's leading passer, has three sure-handed targets in tight end Robert Kelly (11 receptions for 219 yards, 2 touchdowns), wide receiver Dennis McGuire (6 for 100 yards, 1 touchdown) and running back Mike Grippo (11 for 163 yards, 2 touchdowns). Martin's counterpart, David Rodriguez, is a pretty good signal caller himself, passing for 2 touchdowns and rushing for 2 others. Rodriguez's favorite receiver is Michael Baptiste (4 catches for 71 yards, 1 touchdown). Comment: Jay Byrne Gamble, the St. John the Baptist coach, is back after a 10-year hiatus. He has returned to the school where he had three consecutive Metro Bowl titles after serving part of the time as an assistant coach at Hofstra University. His presence, along with a new staff of assistants, has helped turn around a program that had a 12-35-1 record over the past three years.  St. Anthony (3-0) vs. Nazareth (2-0)  at Canarsie Key Players: St. Anthony has averaged a league-best 369 yards on the ground a game, while the Kingsmen defense has allowed a league-low of 89 yards rushing. The Friars' offense, which averages over 30 points a game, revolves around the backfield of Tony Williams (38 carries for 615 yards, 6 touchdowns), who is the league's leading gainer, and Dan Shea (22 carries for 268 yards, 6 touchdowns). Nazareth boasts a good inside (Julien Dale) and outside (Gordon Tunison) running attack. Dale, a 6-foot, 220-pound fullback, has carried 28 times for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns. Tinson is a 5-5, 140-pound tailback who has rushed 17 times for 218 yards and 3 touchdowns.  Comment: St. Anthony's backfield is quick and has been aided by playing all of its games on Astroturf, an advantage that St. Anthony's runners will enjoy once again this afternoon. Long Island  Longwood (1-0) at Brentwood (0-1) Key Players: Longwood's backfield of Jason Schuster (4.6 for 40 yards), John Lange (4.7 speed) and quarterback Eric Brown (4.5 speed) is lightning quick. The threesome combined last week for over 400 yards rushing in a 35-7 victory over Ward Melville. Felipe Sabino will do most of Brentwood's running behind Carl Matzen (6-2, 286-pound tackle) and John Alvarado (6-2, 250-pound guard), both of whom anchor the right side. Comment: Longwood is ranked No. 2 in Suffolk County and 21st in New York State by the Sports Writers Association. Last year, Longwood lost to Connetquot, 28-7, in the county's final. \"I think that experience is going to help us,\" said Schuster. \"We experienced what it's like, and hopefully we're going to learn from it.\" New Jersey  Elizabeth (1-0) at Linden (1-0) Key Players: Elizabeth is once again loaded with Division 1 talent: tailback Kaream Bowser, Sharod Williams (wr-db), Hector Sepuleeda (dt-og) and linebacker Frank Chmiel are all being heavily recruited by colleges. This talented bunch is directed by sophomore Al Hawkins, who is a \"scary quarterback who could throw the long ball off his heels,\" said Linden Coach James McDonald. Linden's two blue-chip prospects are two-way ends Mike Pringley (6-4, 218) and Dave Biles (6-4, 275).  Comment: Last year, Elizabeth had eight Division 1 players but only managed a 5-4 record. \"We had a bunch of superstars that were only interested in themselves,\" said Coach Jerry Moore. He added that this year's team works better together. \"I like the chemistry of this group. They work hard and are very aggressive. And when we hit you, you stay hit. They are playing Elizabeth's style of football.\"  Fieldston (1-1) at Dwight-Englewood (0-2) Key Players: \"To let Gus Ornstein set up is to set yourself up to get beat,\" Englewood Coach Dave Hansburg said of Fieldston's quarterback. Ornstein (16 of 35 for 219, 1 touchdown, 1 interception), who is being recruited by Michigan, Notre Dame and Miami as a quarterback and first baseman, has the ability to pick apart opposing defenses if given the time. Sam Gilbert (4 catches, 122 yards, 1 td) is Fieldston's deep threat. Fieldston will have to contain the Bulldogs backfield of Josh Walsky, Rick Komotar and Steve Milo. Comment: The outcome will be determined on the line of scrimmage, where Fieldston's over-matched line will be called upon to hold back the rush of tackles Luis Locuroto and Matt Seiff.  Connecticut  Bassick (1-1) at Darien (1-1) Key Players: Johnny Barnes (23 carries for 154 yards, 3 touchdowns) is the best of Bassick's speedy backs capable of springing at any time. James Hanford (172 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns) and Vince Childress (181 yards, 2 touchdowns) share the running duties for Darien. Jeff Eaton's (13 for 32 for 221 yards, 2 touchdowns) ability to complete the short passes gives the Blue Wave's offense a more diversified attack than Bassick's. Chris Robbins (9 catches for 193 yards, 1 touchdown) is Eaton's primary target.  Comment: Darien Coach Mike Sangster says he plans to drop a few plays from the teams' playbook after losing by 21-20 to Greenwich last week, snapping the teams' 16-game unbeaten string. \"I just think that we made too many mistakes last week and that we need to go back to the basics,\" he said. Westchester and Rockland  North Rockland (3-0) at Roosevelt (3-0) Key Players: While both teams are comparable in size, North Rockland's linemen hold the advantage over the Indians' less experienced big men. Tom Morreira (tackle, 6-2, 270), Conrad Bartosik (guard, 6-0, 200), Ed Teitz (center, 6-2, 260), Tom Johnson (guard, 6-0, 200) and Rajah Winn (tackle, 5-9, 260) will need to gain maturity in a hurry and find a way to open holes for Roosevelt's star runner, Franklin McBride. He has rushed for 4 scores and over 100 yards in each of the teams' games. McBride's counterpart is Marcus Larkins, a 5-8, 170-pound runner who has rushed for 344 yards and 5 touchdowns. Raiders quarterback Jeff Becker (12 of 25 for 281 yards, 5 touchdowns) is a quality drop-back passer who sees the whole field and delivers the ball with accuracy. Comment: \"This could be the biggest game ever played in Westchester and Rockland County,\" said Roosevelt Coach Tony Dematteo. The teams have never met during the regular season. The game will be carried live on Channel 3 on TCI Cable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Rose Bowl? Northwestern?

The subject is incest, but the story's potential for tawdriness is never exploited. Instead, Ms. Issermann presents a discreet, methodical account of how 12-year-old Alexandrine (Sandrine Blancke) comes to bring and then recant charges against her father, Jean (Alain Bashung).   If the director's approach is at all representative, then the cultural differences between French and American approaches to this subject are fascinating. The American impulse toward tabloid sensationalism is nowhere evident; nor is the urge to air all the family's dirty laundry in the interests of catharsis. If anything, the LeBlancs feel profoundly embarrassed by their problem and wish it would simply go away. In a climate of sexual sophistication and naturalness, the charge of incest is perhaps even more devastating than it would be in dysfunction-conscious America.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/02/nyregion/c-corrections-861593.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Company News column of Business Day yesterday, about the acquisition of the Dexter Shoe Company by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., misstated the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock.

It was not fair, Cablevision said, for the networks to demand money for what was free to anyone with an antenna. The networks argued that they should be paid, just as cable companies pay to carry premium channels like Showtime and HBO.\n\nOn Long Island the availability of stations like WCBS-TV, WNBC-TV and WABC-TV was on the line. Now it appears that little will change. In the battle between the networks and the $20 billion cable industry, an industry in which Cablevision is a major player, cable appears to have won.

Is it my imagination or is the city constantly ripping up, refilling and then reripping up the Avenue of the Americas? This has been going on for a while, and the effect on traffic is disastrous.  A.  Road construction is done in phases, so digging and redigging is necessary. In the first stage of major overhauls like the present job on Avenue of the Americas between West 32d and 59th Streets, the contractor rips up the street to get at the sewer lines, 10 to 30 feet below the street. After the lines are replaced, temporary asphalt is laid down so traffic can proceed -- that is, until the street is ripped up again to accommodate work on the water main, 5 to 10 feet below the street's surface.   \"This gives the appearance that they did something wrong and have to go back to fix it,\" said Lisa Doglian, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. \"But really this is the best way. Otherwise we would have to close down an entire route for two years, or a few blocks for several months.\"   The project will stop for a while around Thanksgiving, to avoid holiday traffic tie-ups, and should be near completion by next summer. A Tree Grows   Q.  How do you go about getting trees for your block?  A.  It's not as hard as you might imagine. Find the address of your community board in the telephone book. Then simply file a request with the board, which will work with the street tree coordinator in the Parks Department to put a tree on your block. Equal Haircuts   Q.  Why do New York salons charge more for women's haircuts than men's? Why would an otherwise liberal city tolerate sexist scissors? Is it even legal? A.  Absolutely not, according to Linda Sachs, the assistant commissioner for the City Department of Consumer Affairs. \"If salons are engaged in setting prices based on gender, it is a violation of the New York City Human Rights law,\" she said. The commission has sued various hair salons violating the law, and the salons were forced to equalize their pricing.    The logic behind the difference varies. Some stylists say that women generally have longer hair; others that men don't get their hair blown dry -- a notion often belied by contemporary hair fashions.    Many salon workers say they don't know how their pricing policy came about. \"It's just always been the rate,\" said an employee at the West Eighth Street branch of International Haircutters, a citywide chain that charges $13 and up for men, $18 and up for women. Another salon, Rubann on East 57th Street, charges men $45 and women $50.    If you are charged more for a cut than a man, you can report the salon to the Human Rights Commission at (212) 306-7500.

In 1958, this cool-yet-sultry redhead earned a place in jazz vocal history when she became the female third of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, the trio famous for setting bullet-fire lyrics to jazz instrumentals. Ms. Ross's octave-leaping, sweet-and-sour voice intrigued Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and other musicians who had little time for female singers. So did her capacity for partying -- until drugs nearly ended the fun permanently.   But her instinct for self-destruction was exceeded by a knack for survival. After beating heroin addiction, bankruptcy and chronic unemployment, the 63-year-old singer and actress has landed on her feet again. In Robert Altman's new film \"Short Cuts,\" she plays a ravaged jazz singer named Tess Trainer who tries to block out reality with booze, pot, cynical love songs and bittersweet memories of a rocky past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Army's Quarterback Takes to the Air to Defeat Akron","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/sports/college-football-east-army-s-quarterback-takes-to-the-air-to-defeat-akron.html","abstract":"  Army 35, Akron 14   AKron's defensive game plan was simple: stop the Army running attack.

Yet, like his English contemporary Arthur Conan Doyle, the graphic artist belongs among the robust Victorians. He was a prodigious traveler, drawing his way through Europe and all over his own country. And, in addition to producing more than 1,500 prints and a score of illustrated books, he was active as a juror of exhibitions and a lecturer. As a native Philadelphian, Pennell was commemorated there in the year of his death by a bumper exhibition but except for a recent restrospective at the Library of Congress, he has received remarkably little attention.    These are among the facts ingeniously worked into the three long columns of blank verse that accompany the Pennell show now hanging in the Benton Museum at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Norman Kraeft is the poet and, with his wife, June, the show's guest curator. Print fanciers will recall the displays that, during the 1970's and 80's, the Kraefts dispatched from their gallery in Bethlehem -- first to Washington, D.C., and then on to motels in farther flung places -- and, of course, their bimonthly newsletters.

The critic H. C. Robbins Landon reconstructed some scores that had been thought to be lost; several were successfully staged at the Holland Festival, including a memorable \"Fedelta Premiata\" directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, and Antal Dorati recorded eight of the operas for Philips to great acclaim (now reissued, 432 413/38; 20 CD's). And that, it seems, was the end of the great Haydn opera revival.   It is astonishing that none of these operas has found its way into the fringes of the repertory, for they contain some of the loveliest vocal writing of the 18th century, and the orchestrations are continually fresh and inventive. Haydn, who is now best known as a composer of vocal music for his Masses and the great, late oratorios, had a high regard for the operas he composed as Kapellmeister at Eszterhaza castle.

The speak-easy was called Mario's; later, it was where Lionel Trilling and I had much of our courtship. There were more elegant speak-easies in New York than Mario's, converted East Side mansions with handsome iron gates and the imposing air of art galleries that deal only in Old Masters, but they were expensive and intimidating. Mario's occupied the two lower floors of a rundown brownstone in the West 40's; it could once have been a theatrical boardinghouse and was now a speak-easy only in the sense that it sold illegal liquor and that its owner went through the required ritual of inspecting his customers through a peephole in the locked front door. In all other respects it was a family-style trattoria, serving excellent home-cooked food at low prices. Most important, it was safe to drink its liquor. Every day during the Prohibition years the newspapers published their grim toll of people blinded or killed by wood alcohol. We were no more deterred by their warnings than a later generation would be deterred from the use of drugs by warnings in the press.    There was no problem in gaining access to a speak-easy in Prohibition; anyone could turn up a \"friend\" whose name would open some thickly bolted door. The innocent, as opposed to the sinister, speak-easy scene is wonderfully portrayed in that rarest of American literary achievements, a good comic novel: Elmer Davis's \"Friends of Mr. Sweeney.\" Not the police but death or blindness was what people like ourselves had to fear from Prohibition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"One Prodigy Itches to Become an Adult","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/arts/one-prodigy-itches-to-become-an-adult.html","abstract":"  Leila Josefowicz's Period of grace as a precocious novelty is almost at an end.

Bec Fin continues to serve lunch every day but Sunday, and an elegant lunch it is.    Incorporating the words fish market in its title suggests something less than fancy, but the chef and owner, Joseph Cizynski, has kept intact the front part of his restaurant (where lunch was always served), with a stucco half-wall separating it from the glass display cases of the shop. The cafe is a bright and cozy place for lunch, with a blue tiled floor, blue and white Mexican tile trim on creamy stucco walls and cafe curtains at the windows. There is seating for 20 at well-spaced, well-napped tables set with blue and white Villeroy & Boch china and fresh roses. And at the end of lunch each woman diner is still presented with a single rose, a reminder that lunch can be as comely as dinner. Service is as careful and the staff as well-trained as ever. A mural depicts cafe life at Moulin Rouge.

Throughout most of the year, sportsmen from all over Britain line their banks engaged in that keenest of Scottish traditions, fishing for salmon on a colorful, hand-tied fly. This is not the timid, intellectual angling of North American trout streams but the hearty, two-fisted manhandling of a 16-foot salmon rod along the craggy outcroppings and raging currents of Europe's finest spate rivers -- those that rise and fall rapidly depending upon local rainfall.   It is also not an enterprise for the faint of heart -- or wallet. The rights to fish salmon in Scottish rivers are often owned separately from the surrounding land, and many rivers are virtually inaccessible because their salmon stocks are held by private individuals or syndicates who reserve fishing rights.  Those wishing to wet a line must book through a hotel with its own fishing rights or rent a private lodge through estate managers who specialize in fishing leases. A week's fishing on one of the better salmon rivers can cost up to $1,500 a rod. (A rod means one person fishing a full day; two or three anglers often divide a rod, alternating with each other in the course of the day, and split the cost.) It's no surprise, then, that few anglers ever release a catch. The salmon are earmarked for the table.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Deaths of Basque Suspects Stir Public Sympathy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/world/deaths-of-basque-suspects-stir-public-sympathy.html","abstract":"  The deaths of two Basque guerrilla suspects in police custody last weekend has stirred sympathy for Basque separatism just as public support for the E.T.A. separatist group appeared to be dwindling.

There is too much discrimination here.\"   Francel Aguirre, a slightly built 27-year-old Ecuadorean, spoke quietly about his life as a member of the village of Ossining's largest group of new immigrants. He was surrounded by the friendly faces of fellow members of his English-as-a-second-language class, in the Ossining School District Office on Croton Avenue.    The village of Ossining has one of the largest concentrations of Ecuadoreans in the county; there are also growing populations in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill.   The teachers of English as a second language had organized a lunchtime party to celebrate their students' progress and allow them to share native foods. The 20 people included a man from Mexico City, a woman from Korea, a woman from Japan and a man from Bangladesh.    Mr. Aguirre said: \"The different races cannot live together here. They must always stay apart. Ecuadoreans are victims of so many things, and we can say nothing. We don't do anything bad. We just work hard, and they give us a hard time.\" Census Figures Analyzed    Outside the shelter of such institutions as the English-as-a-second-language classroom, Mr. Aguirre and his fellow Ecuadoreans say they are often victims of crime and discrimination.    According to 1990 census figures, the white population in the village of Ossining grew at a rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990. The population of nonwhites, as the census report puts it, grew by 44 percent, and the Hispanic population (which can be of any race) increased by 113 percent. By 1990, there were 3,692 Hispanic people in the village, whose population at that time was 22,582. Many village residents estimate that there are at least several thousand Ecuadoreans living and working in Ossining, legally or illegally, making them the largest group of recent immigrants in the village. Of the village's 22,000 or so residents, 4,350 in 1990 were foreign born.   Ossining Union Free School District statistics show that, as of last March, Ecuadorean children represented the largest immigrant group, with 35 newly arrived students in a school population of 3,281. The next largest groups were from Jamaica, Colombia, Peru, Portugal and Haiti.  Students who have lived in this country for longer than three years are not counted in the yearly school district new-immigrant census, so the actual number of immigrant students is much higher.   Officials at St. Ann's School, one of two Roman Catholic schools in Ossining, also say that their largest group of new immigrants is from Ecuador, with 11 children out of a total of 285 in the last school year.    But many Ecuadorean men come to Ossining without their families, work at transitory jobs in landscaping and construction and are uncounted. As large as the Ecuadorean population seems, it is hard to gauge without census designations more specific than \"Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic\" and without children to be counted in the school census. There were 2,312 \"other Hispanic\" residents in the village, according to the census.   Like many of them, Mr. Aguirre left his parents, two brothers and a sister at home in Ecuador and has lived with his uncle and brother in an apartment near the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for five years. A baker who works nights, he said he had been denied a green card (the common name for the alien registration card), but he said he would try again.   The card is obtained when either a close family member is a legal resident or an employer files a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking that the person be granted lawful permanent resident status. Some applications are processed quickly. Some are more complicated. Many illegal immigrants fall prey to fraudulent schemes promising a green card.    Mr. Aquirre said he was attacked while walking along Spring Street in the village. His attackers yelled, \"Speak English!\" before roughing him up, he said. He added that banks will not open accounts without Social Security numbers and that Ecuadoreans are frequently beaten and robbed for their savings, which they carry with them.    Anibal Gonzalez Jr., who is of Puerto Rican descent, is one of two Hispanic police officers in the village of Ossining who have tried to explain American life to the newest Spanish-speaking immigrants. He said, \"If they're going to get into trouble, it's because they're drinking and then driving, or sometimes they wander into certain areas and guys will hassle them.\"   Mr. Gonzalez added: \"We see them with their pockets torn and their faces bloody, or the victims of a car crash, and they refuse medical care. They think the hospitals won't treat their emergency needs.    \"Or they refuse to report a crime to us. They're afraid of being found out if they're here illegally and being deported. We try to straighten them out and tell them that they have to trust the system a little more.\"    Reacting to the Ecuadoreans' fear of authority, Dr. Emil Nigro, director of emergency medicine at the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in neighboring North Tarrytown, said, \"We never, never turn anyone away.\" He said that not only does his emergency room evaluate everyone who comes to them and treat them if needed but that it also does not require identification or insurance. Only a few simple questions are asked at admission and, Dr. Nigro added, \"All records are confidential.\" He added that in most cases hospitals must absorb the cost of emergency room visits by illegal aliens.   Diego Santiago, a Colombian-born police officer who lives in Ossining, has visited St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church on Eastern Avenue to tell Hispanic men how to protect themselves. St. Ann's is known as the immigrants' church in the community.   \"Walk in groups, never alone,\" Officer Santiago said. \"Don't drink to drunkenness. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Don't be afraid of the police.\" The Rev. Frank Oliverio has told these groups that they may feel free to keep their strongboxes with their savings in his rectory, just across the street from St. Ann's. About 350 Hispanic families attend the Spanish Masses at St. Ann's, but the church also offers special Masses in Italian, Portuguese and Korean. St. Ann's also serves many second- and third-generation Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.    Father Oliverio said he hopes to form a support group for Ecuadoreans and other Hispanic men in this country without their families.    Not all Hispanic men are disillusioned. Luis Pani, a 31-year-old laborer, said he has never been assaulted. \"Maybe that's why I'm so happy here,\" he said. Although he has been unsuccessful in obtaining a green card, Mr. Pani, a bachelor, has formed a network of friends and made a life for himself in Ossining.  He has become active in St. Ann's Church and has become a familiar and popular figure in his English-as-a-second-language classes.    \"America is a country of green fields, blue-eyed blond girls, wonderful summers and houses with green gardens and lawnmowers,\" he said. \"That is my dream, to have a house in the suburbs, a wife, a couple of kids and a lawnmower that can blow the leaves in the fall.\"   Marcia Siguenza, an Ecuadorean who recently moved to North Tarrytown after nine years in Ossining, worries about the social havoc caused by the mostly male migration from Ecuador. \"It is sad, very sad,\" she said. \"The men are coming to this country without their wives. Sometimes they remarry here, but it is not really a marriage. They do this because it helps them get a green card.    \"It is breaking up the families in Ecuador. In some places in southern Ecuador, there are no men, only women. And there are bad men who are selling visas for too much, $4,000, which takes many years to pay off with interest.\"    Ms. Siguenza, who has an Alien Registration Card, the so-called green card, is the supervisor of housekeeping at Kings College in Briarcliff. Her four grown children have done well in life, she said. But she said she failed to understand why so many young Ecuadorean men chose this country over their own. \"They have a nice, simple life in Ecuador,\" she said. \"Maybe not with TV or cars. But there's too much here. It's a big transformation for them, and they're not really ready for it. They come mostly from the farms, from the countryside.\"   Jose and Zoila Illescas have four children they left in Ecuador in the care of grandparents. The Illescases are both working, he in construction and she as a housecleaner. They have green cards and eagerly await the day they can afford to bring their children to the United States.  An Unofficial Protector    Carlos Castro, a constable and court officer, is a second-generation Colombian-American who has lived in Ossining for 25 years. He is an unofficial protector and adviser to the newest Hispanic immigrants who end up in the village courtroom. He said he is appalled by their living conditions. \"Many homes have them stacked up inside,\" Mr. Castro said.  \"But you wouldn't know it from the street.\"   Frank Vardy, an immigration authority from the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the Ecuadoreans are similar to the immigrant groups who preceded them. Those Ecuadoreans who choose to return to their native country are \"much like the Italian 'birds of passage' from the late 1800's and early 1900's,\" he said.   \"Those men came and lived cheaply and sent money home to the wife and children,\" Mr. Vardy said. \"Then, after 5 or 10 years, they went home with a bankroll and bought a farm or opened up a business.\"    Despite his steady job as a baker, Mr. Aguirre said he has been disillusioned and feels estranged. He added that he must continue working hard, living simply and watching his back if he is ever to be able to return home with anything to show for his time here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"3 Deer Park Brothers Make Mark in Hollywood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/3-deer-park-brothers-make-mark-in-hollywood.html","abstract":"THINKING more about the Warner brothers than Horace Greeley, more than a decade ago three young men from Long Island went west to seek fame and fortune in the film industry.\n\nHollywood has proven to be a formidable challenge.

After decades in which shoreline development was guided by the same rules that cover the densest urban neighborhoods, the City Planning Commission has crafted zoning measures that are meant to open the land's edge.   Public space, including shoreline walkways with landscaped borders, would be required in certain large projects. Building heights and widths would be limited, as would floor sizes. Development rights could no longer be transferred upland from underwater property. And suburban-style \"big box\" discount stores would be prohibited on piers.   \"This is an unprecedented zoning text amendment that will, for the first time, put the waterfront into the Zoning Resolution,\" declared Richard L. Schaffer, the commission chairman, just before his colleagues voted in August to amend the resolution with 200 pages of new text.   What kind of precedent does the amendment offer? Real estate interests maintain that the zoning would thoroughly dampen development by imposing too many extra costs on private builders. Meanwhile, neighborhood leaders and environmental advocates say the zoning does not go far enough to preserve openness.   But the true test will not come until it is known exactly where along the 578-mile waterfront these new rules are to be applied -- and, of course, until the real-estate market recovers.   \"The issue is, as we begin to come back in this town economically, does this inhibit the development of new sites on the waterfront?\" asked Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, Democrat of Queens, who heads the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee.   Tomorrow, the subcommittee is to hold its second hearing on the subject. The zoning amendment would be considered next by the Land Use Committee and then, later this month, by the full Council.   Legal challenges are almost sure to follow. Questions have already been raised about the constitutionality of the public access and underwater zoning rules, as they might be construed as an unlawful taking of property.   Critics have also faulted the overall process, saying that the effects of the zoning measures cannot be adequately evaluated before planners pinpoint the sites.   \"WE'RE horrified that no environmental impact statement was deemed necessary and believe it may be actionable,\" said William P. Bowser of the West Village Committee, speaking to the zoning subcommittee. Several community boards have also called for a full environmental assessment.   However, the counsel to the City Planning Department, William Valletta, told the subcommittee that the new zoning tools \"have not landed anywhere\" yet.   \"To say 'these are the places and these are the impacts' is just not possible,\" he said.   In the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan of 1992, city planners generally identified some 20 areas, now zoned for manufacturing, where they believe residential redevelopment would be appropriate. These include large parcels in Flushing and Long Island City, Queens, and the Red Hook and Mill Basin sections of Brooklyn.   About 5 percent of the manufacturing districts on the waterfront might be rezoned residentially, said Marilyn Mammano, the director of zoning and urban design for the City Planning Department. Other new rules -- those governing piers and platforms, for example -- would be in force citywide.   Under the new zoning, builders of large projects in medium- to high-density residential and commercial districts would have to set aside 15 to 20 percent of their property for the public, including shoreline esplanades 20 to 25 feet wide, with landscaped \"buffer\" areas between the public and private space.   Currently, there is no such requirement, although negotiations with developers of waterfront projects like Brighton by the Sea in Brooklyn have yielded even greater amounts of land set aside for the public.   To get people out to the esplanades through private property, connections would have to be run between the shoreline and public streets or parks at intervals no greater than 600 feet. These walkways would be 12 to 30 feet wide and would be counted toward the overall public space requirement.   A former counsel to the City Planning Department, Norman Marcus, has criticized this approach, in his role as chairman of the New York County Lawyers' Association urban development and land use committee.   \"There is a kind of dominant reliance on privately owned property as the vehicle for providing public access,\" he said. \"After 30 years of conflict and quarreling over plazas and the rights of owners versus the rights of the public, it seemed silly to be expanding this difficulty to such an important goal as public access to the waterfront.\"   Instead, the lawyers' group proposed that open space and connections be provided through public streets and public parks that were officially mapped as such and, therefore, were the city's responsibility.   Mr. McCaffrey also noted \"a legal issue in terms of takings.\" The Fifth Amendment prohibits taking private property for public use without just compensation.   But Mr. Valletta cited the common-law doctrine that lands between high and low tides -- known as \"wet sand\" -- were held by the state in trust for the public's use for fishing and navigation. That trust was not extinguished by private ownership, he said.   \"Since the public trust is still there,\" he said, \"can we say that the equivalent of the public's historic right to go down to 'wet sand' is, in modern terms, the requirement for public access along a walkway? Our zoning is built on the idea that that's an acceptable and appropriate modern substitute.\"   On land, building sizes would be regulated several ways by the new zoning. In medium- to high-density residential districts, there would be height limits ranging from 150 to 390 feet (roughly 15 to 40 stories). The upper floors could not be wider than 100 feet parallel to the shoreline and floor sizes would have a limit of 7,000 to 8,100 square feet.   The result would be smaller towers and more of them on the site. The Real Estate Board of New York complained that more towers mean more elevator cores, elevators, fire stairs and building entrances. That means higher construction costs, less floor space for apartments and more security problems.   THERE would also be fewer apartments with water views, which command premiums up to 20 percent in rental buildings and up to 50 percent in co-ops or condominiums, the Real Estate Board said.   \"Manhattan market values may make up for the inherent economic penalties,\" the board said. \"However, rezoned industrial areas in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island are not likely to command rents to offset these costs.\"   Mr. Schaffer said, \"We believe these are buildable buildings with a substantial amount of flexibility.\" Planners point to the broad, wall-like expanse of Shore Towers in Astoria, Queens, as an example of what they do not want to happen again.   Something else they do not want to see again is a proposal like Trump City on the Hudson River, which would have used development rights from under water to generate up to 4.5 million square feet of floor space, for a total of 15.33 million square feet. (The project was later scaled down to 8.3 million square feet and renamed Riverside South.)   Trump City would have taken advantage of the fact that property between the bulkhead and pierhead lines has been recognized as part of the zoning lot. Development rights from that property -- obviously unusable under water -- can be transferred to sites on land or piers, yielding much more building bulk than would ordinarily be permitted.   The new zoning would end the use of underwater property, beyond the bulkhead line, in the calculation of allowable density.   This, too, might be challenged as a taking. The Real Estate Board has said the new rule \"raises serious constitutional issues.\"   Mr. Valletta, however, said the granting of development rights from underwater property was not a matter of law but rather an interpretation of the Zoning Resolution by the Buildings Department -- \"a kind of bonus.\"   \"We gave a little extra and we can clearly take it away,\" he said, \"because the constitution protects property rights and this is not a property right.\"   On existing piers, building sizes would be strictly limited, unless a developer received a special permit. As a matter of right, structures less than 200 feet long could rise only 40 feet. Longer, shed-like buildings could rise only 30 feet. And public space would be required all along the pier.   Developers could seek a special permit to build much larger buildings on piers. \"But given that the as-of-right standard has been significantly reduced,\" Ms. Mammano said, \"you have something to measure it against.\" It would seem unlikely, for instance, that planners would approve a structure 10 times higher than the stated limit.   Also on piers, planners have imposed a limit of 20,000 square feet on certain kinds of stores, including \"warehouses that provide accessory retail sales areas.\"   \"YOU couldn't have a 100,000- or 200,000-square-foot Rickel's,\" Ms. Mammano told the subcommittee at its first hearing. \"Going to a Home Depot and loading up on two-by-four's is not a waterfront experience.\"   Mr. McCaffrey asked, \"How is that different from going to the South Street Seaport and shopping at Banana Republic?\"   \"There are no windows, there is no life on the street,\" Ms. Mammano replied. \"At the South Street Seaport, when you go to Banana Republic, you don't just shop there. You have a drink. You sit down. You meander.\"   New piers and platforms are limited to parks, playgrounds or what planners call \"water-dependent\" uses, including docks, boatels, boat yards, launches, heliports, seaplane bases, sewage-disposal plants and marine-transfer stations for garbage.   By special permit, new piers can be converted to \"waterfront-enhancing\" uses like hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, arenas, boat showrooms, skating rinks, tennis courts and golf courses -- provided that the original use had ended at least two years earlier.   While critics suspect that this is a loophole through which commercial development can be slipped on to new piers, Ms. Mammano said: \"Who is going to go out and get a Corps of Engineers permit, financing for a water-dependent use, open it, close it for two years, then come in for a special permit? And all you can get is a waterfront-enhancing use, which does not include residential or offices. We thought the downside risk was minimal.\"   However, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan told the subcommittee, through an aide, that she opposed any rules that would \"give city sanction to as-of-right development of new piers or platforms\" or \"offer a special permit for converting these uses to other more questionable uses.\"   The vice president of the New York City Audubon Society, Leslie T. Sharpe, urged the city to allow new piers only where there was no practicable alternative. \"Activities that are 'enhanced' by a water-based location, such as an ice-skating rink and a golf driving range are not a proper use of the waterfront,\" she told the subcommittee.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"COMMERCE LEADER FACES MAJOR TEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/us/commerce-leader-faces-major-test.html","abstract":"  Ronald H.

Ten minutes by bus or taxi from London's West End, Alfies consists of four floors of cell-like shops, topped by an airy glass-domed roof.\n\nOriginally the site of a Victorian department store, Alfies retains some of the nostalgic feel of a bygone age. It's friendly and informal, it's a bit shabby, which is part of the charm, and it's always welcoming. Customers vary from hip teen-agers to casual visitors to serious buyers -- of all ages, on all budgets. Low overheads and fast-moving stock have attracted some of the best market traders in the business. And a varied lot they are. A fine-arts graduate who specializes in late 18th-century furniture and objects and lectures part time at the Victoria and Albert Museum is delighted to \"get started,\" as she put it, with a scholarly description of a pair of Minton vases of painted Parian.

I thought it was one of the smartest works he ever made -- if people could bring themselves to collect soup cans, why not gather dust? -- and I thought of it again recently when the asbestos scare came crashing down, plunging New York City into panic over the safety of its public schools. The story highlighted the appalling lack of maintenance in the city's school buildings, but it also illuminated a need to refurbish ways of thinking about architecture itself.   This is not the school story we were supposed to be reading this year. These were not the pictures we were supposed to see. Instead of the daily deluge of images of decaying floor tiles, falling-down ceilings and distraught parents, we were meant to be looking with pride and amazement at the remarkable new school buildings that have opened their doors this year throughout the city. The work of the School Construction Authority, a city agency established in 1988 with an appropriation of $4.3 billion, these new buildings represent one of the most important public works programs in the country. They ought to be illustrating an uplifting narrative about the city's ability to turn itself around.

Once a manufacturing district, now a traffic-clogged side street, West 18th between 5th and 7th Avenues is a bleak, industrial-looking stretch. But tucked between the double-parked trucks is a small colony of antiquarian bookstores, most of them new tenants. For those who know and appreciate them they provide escape, a communal relief from the blare of bestsellers. Here is the way books used to be, jumbled on shelves, cloth covers worn to thread by countless other hands. They conjure a time when information was precious, when reading was learning. A privilege.    These stores sell out-of print, rare and used books. An acquired taste, perhaps. Years ago, when the Strand was still on Fourth Avenue, surrounded by smaller competitors, that area proved a mecca for devotees of dust and Dostoevsky. But after the Strand moved to its current location at Broadway and 12th Street, most of those stores disappeared.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"When the Baton Drops, Get Ready for World Premieres and Old Favorites","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/when-the-baton-drops-get-ready-for-world-premieres-and-old-favorites.html","abstract":"  Here are some highlights of the 1993-94 music season: NEW JERSEY  SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA    Masterworks Series   (Concerts at the State Theater in New Brunswick, Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, War Memorial Theater in Trenton, SymphonyHall in Newark and John Harms Center in Englewood.)

The conductor Alexander Rahbari, the Kodaly Quartet and the pianist Jeno Jando have produced estimable accounts of Shostakovich, Haydn and Liszt.   The label's strongest effort so far is a recording of the Prokofiev piano concertos with Kun Woo Paik, a little-known but cultishly admired Parisian pianist who gave a phenomenal recital last year at Alice Tully Hall (8.550565/ 6; two CD's). Versatile and mercurial, Mr. Paik tends to adapt his manner to the situation: he can blast through 20th-century Russian repertory mercilessly but draws a diaphanous wash of sound in the French Impressionists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"POSTINGS: Transforming a Cinema City; From Show Biz to the Business of Education","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/realestate/postings-transforming-a-cinema-city-from-show-biz-to-the-business-of-education.html","abstract":"  When the Fox Film Corporation built it in 1919, 444 West 56th Street was publicized as the world's biggest movie studio under one roof. It was a veritable motion-picture city, complete with two 40-foot-high, 15,000-square-foot stages, in which numerous silent classics were filmed and screened.    Then talkies came in, and the building's once-budding show biz career got reduced to cameo appearances (William Fox's wood paneled office stood in for a Harvard dining club in the 1971 film \"Love Story\"). Loath to spend the huge amount it would have taken to convert it to sound stages, Fox instead used the building for offices. In 1973 Enterprise Development Associates bought it and converted it into a midtown campus for the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which has since moved to the old Haaren High School building a few blocks north on 10th Avenue.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Neighborhood Report: Bayside; Across the Great Subdivide","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-bayside-across-the-great-subdivide.html","abstract":"  Bayside is a leafy neighborhood of homeowners where most of the residents are, well, homeowners.

And its new home really is a schoolhouse, a 1920's building situated on a hill so that the sun pours through its huge windows. The owner, Lee Pope, does not do things by halves: in addition to three large galleries, the space accommodates a theater and eight artists' studios, at least one of whose tenants commutes from Manhattan. A more picture-perfect setup can scarcely be imagined.    On view in the galleries now is a show by two sculptors, John Nesbitt and Brett Stern, and two painters, Ann Richardson and Jean Tate. Mr. Nesbitt is the most experienced of the four, having shown extensively in his own country, Canada, since the mid-1950's. He works with the precision of a jeweler, locking together by means of bolts and welds, forms in alabaster, marble, wood and various metals.    An example is the chunky bronze less than a foot tall, which is impregnated vertically by a sliver of lead and bisected horizontally by a layer of gray marble. In shape and general character the piece recalls Brancusi's kissing couple. There are other allusions to reality: a block of stained wood ornamented with bronze elements, which suggests a head, African style, and a bronze that could pass as a flowering plant growing out of a tree trunk.    Otherwise, Mr. Nesbitt remains a nonobjective sculptor deeply preoccupied with his craft, leaving the skins of his carved elements alternately rough and smooth, welding (or soldering) the cast shapes and combining them all into masses that are virtually watertight. One of his best efforts is a fence of small alabaster blocks. He is easily the best artist in the show.   Although Mr. Stern's is by far the largest contribution -- 13 ceramics -- art seems to be the least of his interests. Having billed himself in a resume as the president of Symagery, a one-man research and new-product development company, he goes on to list numerous accomplishments. These include a book titled \"99 Ways to Open a Beer Bottle Without a Bottle Opener\" and a method of manufacturing clothes without human intervention by way of a machine that can produce a garment in 45 seconds.   His achievements as a model maker include an eight-foot telephone for a television commercial, a four-foot brownie for National Kosher Foods and the beetle headdresses worn in the Broadway musical \"Cats.\" Way down at the bottom of Mr. Stern's remarkable document are listed the five ceramic shows in which he has participated during the last year or so, one of them at the American Craft Museum in Manhattan.   Given credits like these, a viewer might be forgiven for wondering why Mr. Stern wants to diversify and how he has the time to do so. But it is possible that he is following the example set by Samuel F. B. Morse when he turned to portraiture as a means of financing his scientific inventions. In any case, the ceramics are purely exercises in craft, being variations on a bifurcated shape that looks a lot like the lower half of a standing female torso. They come in black, gray and shades of brown, with a bubbly crater glaze on the outside and a smooth metallic luster applied to the crevices within.   Although not as obsessive as Mr. Stern, Ms. Tate also makes much of a small idea. Each of her five large canvases is stained or lightly sprayed with color and embossed with rectangles, triangles and dabs of impasto applied thick and glossy in irregular rows. The colors of these include ultramarine applied neat, and viridian seemingly glazed over white, and they generally hang against backgrounds tinted in a paler version of the same hue, accompanied by patches of, say, thin lemon yellow. Ms. Tate's canvases are not bad, but they would be better if she considered more carefully the effects that contiguous colors have on each other.   Ms. Richardson does consider these effects and, hence, has slightly more success with her variations on a single image. This is a disk enclosed by a rectangle, which in turn, is enclosed by two or three more rectangles. The disk, usually black, is often rimmed in a contrasting color, as are the squares, which come in various grays, thinly applied, generally over a contrasting hue. Nevertheless, the works seem more anxious than spontaneous. It's as if the artist does not want to push them further for fear of spoiling her happy accidents.   Despite its occasional good points, the show on the whole conveys a feeling of emptiness, a feeling that is more often found in suburban than urban galleries. Whether or not this is yet another side effect of zoning, Renee Kahn, a painter living in Stamford, has taken up arms against the problem by starting a Journal of American Suburban Art. Having circulated a leaflet with questions like \"Do you deny your suburban identity at New York parties?\" and \"Has living in the suburbs turned your brains to mush?\" Ms. Kahn plans a first issue based on the responses. In a telephone conversation, the artist explained that $1 mailed to the journal at 78 Webb's Hill Road, Stamford, Conn. 06903, will yield a photocopy of Volume 1, No. 1, mailed unbound in a paper bag. From little acorns. . .   The show at the Schoolhouse Galleries continues through Nov. 21. The phone number is 277-3461.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Corrupt From Top to Bottom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/books/corrupt-from-top-to-bottom.html","abstract":"  THE PENTAGON WARS Reformers Challenge the Old Guard.

CHINATOWN/BROOKLYN HEIGHTS Anchoring a Bridge In the River and the Air    It is almost a metaphysical question: What holds up a bridge? More specifically, what holds up the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, which many New Yorkers rattle across while praying silently that the roadway not collapse beneath them?   On Saturday, the New York Transit Museum, in Brooklyn Heights, will explain how the bridges stay up. Engineers from the city Department of Transportation explain the bridges' construction in a Saturday tour called \"Bridge Game: Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges Close Up.\"   The tour begins at the Manhattan end of the Manhattan Bridge, where engineers will explain the function of the anchorages that hold the bridge firmly in the river. After lunch (egg rolls and won ton soup; participants should take lunch money) the tour continues with the Williamsburg Bridge, where a new set of engineers will give the inside view.
