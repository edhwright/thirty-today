A governess has come to an isolated English estate to care for two children. She soon suspects that they have been sexually corrupted by her predecessor and a manservant, both of whom have died, both of whom seem to have returned as ghosts to haunt their once innocent charges. The composer and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, undercut the ambiguity cultivated by James; in the opera these ghosts are as real as their corruptive effects. At the beginning of the second act they triumphantly sing a line from Yeats: \"The ceremony of innocence is drowned.\"   But from that moment on, as the opera proceeds through its compact, beautifully orchestrated scenes, ambiguities begin to accumulate and the work itself begins to seem a strange ceremony of innocence. We begin to doubt some perceptions of the Governess, whose melodic lines echo and anticipate the singing of the demonic servant, Quint. The score, which turns church bells ominous and nursery rhymes into signs of corruption, sometimes seems as if it is being strained through the Governess's psyche. Britten's ceremony marks not the dissolution of innocence in the children, but the growth of an uncertainty that innocence is even possible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940422","headline":"1894:Cholera in Portual : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/opinion/IHT-1894cholera-in-portual-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"During several months, a number of young diplomatists attended at the Quai d'Orsay where they discussed measures to be taken to prevent the development of cholera.

One can even overlook the fact that they promoted a soap that practically tore the skin off your body.\" Ah, the unknown Bergman. He is everywhere in \"Images: My Life in Film,\" a series of wry, lucid, ofter harsh reflections on his life's work that was published in Sweden in 1990 but appeared in English translation only three months ago.    New though it is, \"Images\" is not the most recent of Mr. Bergman's books to appear here, and it is certainly not the last word on the little Ingmar, \"considered sullen and too sensitive.\" It is not easy to keep up with his literary output since he stopped directing feature films in 1982.    \"Sunday's Children,\" an exquisite autobiographical film about his boyhood, was written by Mr. Bergman and directed by his 32-year-old son, Daniel. It is now at the Film Forum in the South Village. And Ingmar Berman's novel of \"Sunday's Children\" has just been published as well. In the hands of most former film makers, the novel might be a watered-down version of the movie. But \"Sunday's Children\" is as elegant, honest and emotinally brutal as \"Fanny and Alexander\"; though its scope is slender, this brief novel is a perfectly shaped treasure that stands among the finest work of Mr. Bergman's career.    The freshness of \"Sunday's Children\" in both forms is amazing, because Mr. Bergman has written this story before. It exists nearly whole, in subject and shape, in the next-to-last chapter of \"The Magic Lantern\" (1987), the first of the autobiographical books that have made Mr. Bergman, now 75, one of the most alluring writers of recent years.    In \"The Magic Lantern,\" one July the young Ingmar accompanies his father, Erik, from their country house to a nearby village where Erik Bergman, a minister, is to preach. Ingmar is a Sunday's child, according to folklore, able to see fairies and other visions. He takes the trip with his father by ferry and bicycle, and recalls seeing in the church a stained-glass window depicting \"Death leading a dance to the Dark Lands, wielding his scythe like a flag.\" - a picture that would become the final scene of \"The Seventh Seal\" and one of the most famouse Bergman images of all. Comically, Ingmar's older brother, Dag, promises to pay him for eating a live worm, then reneges on the offer after the boy with the notoriously fussy stomach has swallowed the creature. These are major incidents in \"Sunday's Children,\" too.    More striking, that chapter in \"The Magic Lantern\" includes flashes forward in time to the adult Ingmar Bergman visiting his elderly, widowed father. Their relationship is one of fear, anger, coldness. In expanded form, those forward flashes become the harsh emotional underside of the lyrically beautiful \"Sunday's Children,\" on screen and on the page.    \"I am forever living in my childhood,\" Mr. Bergman writes in \"Images.\" As the details of those July days echo from memory through \"The Magic Lantern\" on to \"Sunday's Children,\" they hold the key to the art of Mr. Bergman's memoirs. He keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audience in dazzling new shapes.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" the young Ingmar is an 8-year-old called Pu (on screen played by the golden-haired, wide-eyed Henrik Linnros). He is a serious child who both loves and hates his father and is already troubled by the idea of death. When film and novel flash ahead to 1968, the 50-year-old Ingmar is still angry and intransigent on his visits to Erik. In a dizzying swirl of connections between father and son, the middle-aged Ingmar isplayed on screen by Per Myrberg, who looks nothing like the real Mr. Bergman. But his father is played by Thommy Berggren, who as he ages looks quite a bit like Ingmar Bergman today.    Judging the adult Ingmar harshly, Mr. Bergman has made \"Sunday's Children\" a huge gesture of reconciliation to his now-dead father. It is also a great gift to his son. (It is easy to speculate that Mr. Bergman's ramshackle personal life, with eight children spread among four wives and one lover, might make usch gestures especially prized.) Daniel Bergman mad children's films and worked for television before filming \"Sunday's Children,\" his first feature. When the project was conceived, father and son agreed that Ingmar would write without consulting his son, and Daniel would direct without his father's help. Ingmar Bergman stayed away from the set of \"Sunday's Children.\"    The importance of teh screenplay is suggested gy the vast difference between \"The Best Intentions,\" the rich, trenchant 1991 film about his parents that was written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by Bille August, and the sprawling fiasco of \"The House of the Spirits,\" the current film written and directed by Mr. August. Only the luxurious scenery in those two films is similar.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" too, capturing the graceful picturesque quality of two days in the country is the easy part. Daniel Bergman's cinematographer, Tony Forsberg, even substituted for Sven Nykvist on \"Fanny and Alexander\" for a few weeks when Mr. Nykvist got the flu.    But Daniel Bergman has done more than create a pretty film that echoes his father's lyricism. Daniel and his actors capture the tormented emotions beneath the picturesque summer in the country. Pu is a darling, sympathetic little boy. \"Shut your mouth, Pu,\" his Uncle Carl says. \"You look stupid with you mouth open.\" The comment is repeated by Pu's nanny and by Day, but you have to return to \"Magic Lantern\" to discover why Pu's mouth is always gaping. Adenoid probglems caused the young Ingmar to breathe through his mouth, \"which made me look stupid,\" Mr. Bergman writes.    Pu is also preternaturally serious, like the famously humorless little Ingmar. Both film and novel rely on his relentless questions. Pu keeps asking \"What?\" like a nervous tic. When a servant tells a ghost story about a local watchmaker who hanged himself, the tale becomes a fantastic set piece on the page and an eerie black-and-white vision on screen. The watchmaker kills a demonic gradfather clock and a small, fully formed woman who lives inside it. Later, Pu goes to the place where the watchmaker killed himself and asks in a dream, \"When will I die?\" The watchmaker answers, \"Always,\" and idea that the film maker has carried with him throughout his career.    Similar though the two versions of \"Sunday's Children\" are, each makes a unique contribution to the grand mosaic of the Bergman biography. On screen, the adult Ingmar's coldness is more visceral; in the novel the connections between past and present are stronger and more resonant.    When Pu sits on the edge of the ferry and dangles his feet in the water, his father swats him on the head in fury, which leads directly to a flash forward. \"What did I do wrong?\" the aged father asks, having discovered his dead wife's diaries, which call their marriage \"a life-fiasco.\" The adult Ingmar coldly, even cruelly, tells his father how frightened the family was of his anger. Then he walks away. The scene returns to Pu and his father, who apologizes for pulling the child away from his dangerous perch on the ferry so violently. \"I was scared,\" he says. \"When you're scared, you get angry.\" The explanation goes back to \"The Magic Lantern\" and to the heart of the Bergman family's anger and unhappiness. Pu, having overheard his parents arguing, fears that his father will leave; Erik fears losing his wife; over the years, Ingmar's anger becomes implacable.    Mr. Bergman deftly positions his leaps in time to reflect backward and forward, so the present illuminates the past and the past explains the present. On screen, when the camera returns from 1968 to Pu's boyhood, the flashes forward almost seem to have been prophetic visions of this Sunday's child. On the page, the effect is the opposite, as the voice of Ingmar Bergman today is heard shaping his past.    On their way home from the sermon, Pu and his father are caught in a storm. The father puts his coat around Pu, and the story jumps ahead to Erik Bergman's deathbed. Erik whispers a blessing on his son, who is unable to understand what his father is mumbling. As the story returns to the past. Erik once more puts his coat around Pu, echoing the gesture of blessing. \"Sunday's Children\" itself is a blessing that Ingmar Bergman has bestowed on Daniel. This son had the good sense and talent to appreciate the gift and turn it into an enduring Bergman film.

Merchandise peddlers can be a terrible nuisance; they clutter sidewalks, interfere with traffic and block doorways to established stores. Moreover, they make for vastly unfair competition because peddlers who sell those scarves, watches and T-shirts are often unlicensed and rarely pay taxes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940422","headline":"Critic's Choice; Of Character And the West","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/movies/critic-s-choice-of-character-and-the-west.html","abstract":"  Long before the revisionist western was a glint in Clint Eastwood's eye, there was John Ford. He established the character-driven western with his classic \"Stagecoach\" in 1939, and by 1956 was probing the moral ambiguities of the frontier in \"The Searchers,\" a film that seems deeper with every viewing. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Ford's birth, the Museum of Modern Art is presenting \"John Ford, 1894-1973: An American Master,\" a series of films from the museum's collection that will run through May 6.    This weekend's highlight is a new print of \"The Searchers.\" Beloved by western fans and cineastes, this is the John Wayne movie for people who think they don't like John Wayne. As Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier, Wayne goes on an obsessive yearslong search for his niece (Natalie Wood; even Ford wasn't perfect at casting), who had been abducted by Indians. When he finds her, all his certainty about good and evil -- and all moviedom's certainty about cowboys and Indians -- is subjected to fierce moral scrutiny. As in his other great westerns, Ford doesn't stint on action here, or on the grand landscape of Monument Valley. \"The Searchers\" will be shown tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2 P.M.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940422","headline":"Going Down With His Precinct","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/nyregion/going-down-with-his-precinct.html","abstract":"  He got the call from the chief of patrol at 11 A.M.

One can even overlook the fact that they promoted a soap that practically tore the skin off your body.\" Ah, the unknown Bergman. He is everywhere in \"Images: My Life in Film,\" a series of wry, lucid, ofter harsh reflections on his life's work that was published in Sweden in 1990 but appeared in English translation only three months ago.    New though it is, \"Images\" is not the most recent of Mr. Bergman's books to appear here, and it is certainly not the last word on the little Ingmar, \"considered sullen and too sensitive.\" It is not easy to keep up with his literary output since he stopped directing feature films in 1982.    \"Sunday's Children,\" an exquisite autobiographical film about his boyhood, was written by Mr. Bergman and directed by his 32-year-old son, Daniel. It is now at the Film Forum in the South Village. And Ingmar Berman's novel of \"Sunday's Children\" has just been published as well. In the hands of most former film makers, the novel might be a watered-down version of the movie. But \"Sunday's Children\" is as elegant, honest and emotinally brutal as \"Fanny and Alexander\"; though its scope is slender, this brief novel is a perfectly shaped treasure that stands among the finest work of Mr. Bergman's career.    The freshness of \"Sunday's Children\" in both forms is amazing, because Mr. Bergman has written this story before. It exists nearly whole, in subject and shape, in the next-to-last chapter of \"The Magic Lantern\" (1987), the first of the autobiographical books that have made Mr. Bergman, now 75, one of the most alluring writers of recent years.    In \"The Magic Lantern,\" one July the young Ingmar accompanies his father, Erik, from their country house to a nearby village where Erik Bergman, a minister, is to preach. Ingmar is a Sunday's child, according to folklore, able to see fairies and other visions. He takes the trip with his father by ferry and bicycle, and recalls seeing in the church a stained-glass window depicting \"Death leading a dance to the Dark Lands, wielding his scythe like a flag.\" - a picture that would become the final scene of \"The Seventh Seal\" and one of the most famouse Bergman images of all. Comically, Ingmar's older brother, Dag, promises to pay him for eating a live worm, then reneges on the offer after the boy with the notoriously fussy stomach has swallowed the creature. These are major incidents in \"Sunday's Children,\" too.    More striking, that chapter in \"The Magic Lantern\" includes flashes forward in time to the adult Ingmar Bergman visiting his elderly, widowed father. Their relationship is one of fear, anger, coldness. In expanded form, those forward flashes become the harsh emotional underside of the lyrically beautiful \"Sunday's Children,\" on screen and on the page.    \"I am forever living in my childhood,\" Mr. Bergman writes in \"Images.\" As the details of those July days echo from memory through \"The Magic Lantern\" on to \"Sunday's Children,\" they hold the key to the art of Mr. Bergman's memoirs. He keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audience in dazzling new shapes.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" the young Ingmar is an 8-year-old called Pu (on screen played by the golden-haired, wide-eyed Henrik Linnros). He is a serious child who both loves and hates his father and is already troubled by the idea of death. When film and novel flash ahead to 1968, the 50-year-old Ingmar is still angry and intransigent on his visits to Erik. In a dizzying swirl of connections between father and son, the middle-aged Ingmar isplayed on screen by Per Myrberg, who looks nothing like the real Mr. Bergman. But his father is played by Thommy Berggren, who as he ages looks quite a bit like Ingmar Bergman today.    Judging the adult Ingmar harshly, Mr. Bergman has made \"Sunday's Children\" a huge gesture of reconciliation to his now-dead father. It is also a great gift to his son. (It is easy to speculate that Mr. Bergman's ramshackle personal life, with eight children spread among four wives and one lover, might make usch gestures especially prized.) Daniel Bergman mad children's films and worked for television before filming \"Sunday's Children,\" his first feature. When the project was conceived, father and son agreed that Ingmar would write without consulting his son, and Daniel would direct without his father's help. Ingmar Bergman stayed away from the set of \"Sunday's Children.\"    The importance of teh screenplay is suggested gy the vast difference between \"The Best Intentions,\" the rich, trenchant 1991 film about his parents that was written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by Bille August, and the sprawling fiasco of \"The House of the Spirits,\" the current film written and directed by Mr. August. Only the luxurious scenery in those two films is similar.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" too, capturing the graceful picturesque quality of two days in the country is the easy part. Daniel Bergman's cinematographer, Tony Forsberg, even substituted for Sven Nykvist on \"Fanny and Alexander\" for a few weeks when Mr. Nykvist got the flu.    But Daniel Bergman has done more than create a pretty film that echoes his father's lyricism. Daniel and his actors capture the tormented emotions beneath the picturesque summer in the country. Pu is a darling, sympathetic little boy. \"Shut your mouth, Pu,\" his Uncle Carl says. \"You look stupid with you mouth open.\" The comment is repeated by Pu's nanny and by Day, but you have to return to \"Magic Lantern\" to discover why Pu's mouth is always gaping. Adenoid probglems caused the young Ingmar to breathe through his mouth, \"which made me look stupid,\" Mr. Bergman writes.    Pu is also preternaturally serious, like the famously humorless little Ingmar. Both film and novel rely on his relentless questions. Pu keeps asking \"What?\" like a nervous tic. When a servant tells a ghost story about a local watchmaker who hanged himself, the tale becomes a fantastic set piece on the page and an eerie black-and-white vision on screen. The watchmaker kills a demonic gradfather clock and a small, fully formed woman who lives inside it. Later, Pu goes to the place where the watchmaker killed himself and asks in a dream, \"When will I die?\" The watchmaker answers, \"Always,\" and idea that the film maker has carried with him throughout his career.    Similar though the two versions of \"Sunday's Children\" are, each makes a unique contribution to the grand mosaic of the Bergman biography. On screen, the adult Ingmar's coldness is more visceral; in the novel the connections between past and present are stronger and more resonant.    When Pu sits on the edge of the ferry and dangles his feet in the water, his father swats him on the head in fury, which leads directly to a flash forward. \"What did I do wrong?\" the aged father asks, having discovered his dead wife's diaries, which call their marriage \"a life-fiasco.\" The adult Ingmar coldly, even cruelly, tells his father how frightened the family was of his anger. Then he walks away. The scene returns to Pu and his father, who apologizes for pulling the child away from his dangerous perch on the ferry so violently. \"I was scared,\" he says. \"When you're scared, you get angry.\" The explanation goes back to \"The Magic Lantern\" and to the heart of the Bergman family's anger and unhappiness. Pu, having overheard his parents arguing, fears that his father will leave; Erik fears losing his wife; over the years, Ingmar's anger becomes implacable.    Mr. Bergman deftly positions his leaps in time to reflect backward and forward, so the present illuminates the past and the past explains the present. On screen, when the camera returns from 1968 to Pu's boyhood, the flashes forward almost seem to have been prophetic visions of this Sunday's child. On the page, the effect is the opposite, as the voice of Ingmar Bergman today is heard shaping his past.    On their way home from the sermon, Pu and his father are caught in a storm. The father puts his coat around Pu, and the story jumps ahead to Erik Bergman's deathbed. Erik whispers a blessing on his son, who is unable to understand what his father is mumbling. As the story returns to the past. Erik once more puts his coat around Pu, echoing the gesture of blessing. \"Sunday's Children\" itself is a blessing that Ingmar Bergman has bestowed on Daniel. This son had the good sense and talent to appreciate the gift and turn it into an enduring Bergman film.

Even as she moves into her 70's, the pianist Dorothy Donegan remains one of a kind. As a child, her skills so impressed the great jazz pianist Art Tatum that he gave her lessons, and she can still keep listeners on the edges of their seats with her unpredictable roller-coaster rides, which draw on whatever crosses her mind. Even her longtime New York accompanists -- the bassist Jon Burr and the drummer Ray Mosca -- often seem in danger of falling off the Donegan Express. Although no longer as volcanic as she once was, Miss Donegan still has a strong stomping foot that pounds home the beat to even a casual listener. She plays tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45 and Sunday night at 8:15 and 10:15. The music charge is $23.50 tonight and tomorrow night, $17.50 on Sunday. There is no minimum. JOHN S.

Barbara Carroll is now in her 16th season of playing piano surrounded by the drawings of Ludwig Bemelmans, in a room that was named for the cartoonist and musician long before Miss Carroll arrived there. Earlier, in the 1950's, she had established another room as her home base: the Embers on 52d Street when it was known as Swing Alley. Despite these long runs, her playing has remained fresh and adventuresome; she has moved through new areas of jazz after starting as a be-bop disciple of Bud Powell and has also extended her performances to reveal a warm singing personality. She plays and sings tonight and tomorrow night from 9:45 until 12:45 A.M. There is a $10 music charge but no minimum. J. S. W. Drummer-Influenced Sax    Richie Cole Quintet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. The fact that the alto saxophonist Richie Cole has been influenced by both the drummer Buddy Rich and another alto player, Phil Woods, accounts for much of the power of his virtuoso style. From 1969 through 1972, he was in Buddy Rich's Big Band, a group that carried out explosive ideas set off by Mr. Rich's drums. The influence of Phil Woods started in Cole's high school years, providing a basis for the saxophonist's lively, positive attack. His current quartet is made up of Bobby Enriquez on piano, Vic Juris on guitar, Ed Howard on bass and Vic Jones on drums.

The only good news is the casting: Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Stuart Masterson and Drew Barrymore are the glamorous wranglers who play prostitutes -- or \"harlots,\" in the screenplay's quaint argot -- on the run.

The questions \"What should be done here?\" and \"How?\" can be daunting for musicians used to being guided by the composers' expressed wishes.    The student singers and musicians of the Juilliard Opera Center have been puzzling over Monteverdi's 1642 opera, \"L'Incoronazione di Poppea,\" with musicological prodding from Gary Wedow (who, in turn, based his realization on Alan Curtis's 1990 edition of the work) and staging by Frank Corsaro.

Stars Push Blues to Playoff Brink  Paul Cavallini scored on a power play at 8 minutes 34 seconds of overtime as the Dallas Stars beat the St. Louis Blues, 5-4, to take a commanding 3-0 lead in their first-round National Hockey League playoff series in St. Louis last night. The Stars' third power-play goal of the game came with the Blues' Petr Nedved in the penalty box for holding. Cavallini took a shot that deflected off the Blues' Brendan Shanahan but he got the puck right back and beat Curtis Joseph with 40-foot drive for his first goal of the playoffs. Cavallini, a former Blues player, added a second-period assist and has a goal and five assists in the series. The Stars, who won despite getting outshot by 48-31, go for the sweep in Game 4 tomorrow night in St. Louis. (AP) GYMNASTICS  Miller Wins World All-Around Title  Shannon Miller of the United States completed two spectacular vaults tonight to win her second straight women's all-around title at the world gymnastics championships, in Brisbane, Australia. Miller needed to score 9.775 with her two vaults to win, and she scored 9.812. She totaled 39.274 points for the four disciplines in retaining the title she won last year at Birmingham, England. It was a remarkable performance considering that Miller, 17, from Edmond, Okla., injured a stomach muscle last month and missed two weeks of training. Lavinia Milosovici of Romania won the silver medal with a score of 39.236, 0.038 behind. Dina Kochetkova of Russia was third at 39.125. (AP) SOCCER  Demotion Ruling Stuns Marseilles  The European soccer champion, Olympique Marseilles, was demoted yesterday to the second division of the French League next season for bribing three players on a rival team to throw a game last May. \"This is a very grave decision,\" said the Marseilles financial director, Alain Laroche. \"This is just crazy.\" The French Football Federation's sanctions culminated the 11-month-old scandal, which had already resulted in European soccer officials preventing the club from defending its 1993 European Champions Cup title.

A few weeks ago it put on a catastrophic blues program, a misguided collection of players and pejorative ideas about blues that indicated those in charge didn't have much of a grasp of who is capable of what in the jazz world. Not a good thing for a jazz series. Then along comes Thursday night's concert, \"The New Legacy,\" which did what the jazz program has done best: introduce unheralded, talented arrangers; allow gifted improvisers room to sell their wares, and let a fine big band roar.   The show was meant to pair young musicians with older ones, and it opened with \"New Orleans Joy,\" a piece by the trumpeter and arranger Randy Sandke that brought together four tunes loosely associated with the city of the title. He was joined by three other trumpeters, Doc Cheatham, Nicholas Payton and Jon Faddis. Mr. Sandke is one of the more miscast musicians working in jazz. He's often written off, unfairly, as a swing revivalist. But he can play virtually any jazz idiom, and as an arranger he brought modernist dissonances, bitter and astringent, to the piece. He also flashed lush reed writing, and roiling, shouting polyphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"New York:Spring Brings Out The Buyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/your-money/IHT-new-yorkspring-brings-out-the-buyers.html","abstract":"TAKE THE real-estate broker's maxim, \"Location, location, location.\" Add to that, \"Bigger is better\" and you have a snapshot of where the current action is in Manhattan's apartment market..A glance at a recent survey of co-op apartme","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Faces Turned to Crimson; Strike at Harvard Club Is Embarrassing, at the Least","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/nyregion/faces-turned-to-crimson-strike-at-harvard-club-is-embarrassing-at-the-least.html","abstract":"  Predictability is a cherished hallmark of a good city club.

You say that this \"innocent-sounding\" provision would undermine cost and quality controls. The truth is that these provisions are essential to protect quality of care.   You assume insurance companies are interested in providing cost-effective, good-quality care. My experience as a practicing psychologist tells me otherwise. Insurance companies are indeed motivated to minimize costs (that is, benefits paid out) -- this increases profits. But they have no incentive to maximize quality -- that often costs money. The result is that they often exclude highly trained and experienced providers who they think may prescribe more expensive treatment, and allow in mediocre practitioners who they think will be more compliant with the company's wish to save money. Similarly, \"medical necessity,\" the standard by which the companies determine whether to pay for treatment, is generally defined in a highly restrictive and self-serving way. In mental health treatment, the area with which I am familiar, brief, inexpensive and inadequate treatment is often all that is approved, when more extensive treatment is necessary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Homes for Gnomes, in Country Gardens and Suburbia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/style/IHT-homes-for-gnomes-in-country-gardens-and-suburbia.html","abstract":"Hey ho!

A swooping scale; silence (what to do next?); lyrical snippets; nervous syncopated repetitions; disjointed key changes; more of all the above, again and again. The five stalwart sharps of B major rescue us at the end as Beethoven arrives at his other lifelong obsession, the theme and variations form.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Aid Sought For Jailing Illegal Aliens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/us/aid-sought-for-jailing-illegal-aliens.html","abstract":"  President Clinton asked Congress today to appropriate $350 million to help states pay the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of felonies.

So a Broadway version to which all the nonsense has been added raises a few questions. For whom is this show really intended? Can its live action rival the film's flawless animation? How will it play for children, who were after all the audience that made \"Beauty and the Beast\" a hit? And what if those children only have milk money, not the $65 needed for a seat in the orchestra?   Bear in mind that a family outing for four can cost $260 -- maybe more, if you don't make it past the $45 sweatshirts and $20 audiocassettes at the souvenir stand. Can this experience possibly be worth 13 times as much as a \"Beauty and the Beast\" videotape, which also happens to be the more enduring purchase? Believe me, even a 5-year-old can do the arithmetic on that one, especially a 5-year-old who loves the film. And Broadway's \"Beauty and the Beast\" can count on a lot of stiff criticism within the one-digit age bracket, which constitutes most of the presold audience for this extravaganza.

Naipaul are an interlocking series of journeys. The longest and the most difficult was his first. In 1950, just before he turned 18, he ventured from the New World to the Old World, from Trinidad, where he was born -- the grandson of emigres from India -- to England, where he had a scholarship at Oxford University. Eventually he became a writer with a world perspective, and he has never stopped traveling. These travels have inspired 22 books of fiction, history and commentary. At 61, Vidiadhar Surajprasad Naipaul is a self-remade man, a distinguished man of letters with a penetrating view of life, and of his life, as a source for literature. As he says: \"One isn't born one's self. One is born with a mass of expectations, a mass of other people's ideas -- and you have to work through it all.\"   For Mr. Naipaul, his new book, \"A Way in the World\" (to be published next month), is, in the Proustian phrase, a \"pilgrimage of the heart.\" It represents the author's search for selfhood and for an understanding of the effects of inheritance. In this highly personalized narrative, he looks back at his books and relives the creative process in a new form. \"A Way in the World\" is, he says, \"a settling of accounts for me with myself,\" for what he regards as errors of artistic judgment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Connecticut Q&A;: Michael B.

Their needs are many -- wide receiver, backup running back, defensive back -- but since this isn't fantasy football, they can only make one selection with that 24th pick.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Streetscapes/The Walker Town House; The Grand Mansion of an Early Black Entrepreneur","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/realestate/streetscapes-walker-town-house-grand-mansion-early-black-entrepreneur.html","abstract":"  UNDER Laurie Beckelman, its chairwoman, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission has emphasized looking in the city's residential neighborhoods for buildings of architectural or historic merit.

The most sweeping of the four proposals being floated is endorsed by the Florida Hotel and Motel Association and would grant each of the state's 67 counties the right to choose among any combination of freestanding casinos and casinos in hotels, riverboats and parimutuel facilities. The campaign to pass a constitutional amendment authorizing gaming picked up momentum after the Florida Legislature defeated similar legislation during its annual 60-day session, which ended earlier this month.

Given Eisenman's stature, the oversight is startling but symbolically apt. For a quarter of a century, it has been this architect's fate -- more accurately, his chosen path -- to remain just slightly beyond the pale.   Obsessed by his place in history but terrified of being pigeonholed, at once covetous and contemptuous of public acceptance, Eisenman, 61, has made a career out of his alienation from conventional practice. While scarcely an obscure figure, he has attained prominence within the profession by cultivating the impression that he remains outside it, claiming that his work amounts to a sustained critique of what the rest of the profession is up to. This despite the fact that in the past few years Eisenman has completed or begun a small city's worth of major commissions, including a convention center and an art museum in Columbus, Ohio; two office buildings in Tokyo; a design school in Cincinnati; a theater complex in Atlanta; and a 40-acre housing and commercial development in Frankfurt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/connecticut-guide-851108.html","abstract":"  DARROW DELIGHTS   Since 1933, when his first cartoon was published in The New Yorker, Whitney Darrow has extracted chuckles and guffaws from millions of people who then looked forward to the next of his more than 1,500 drawings.

Along these roads, temples and rest houses were built for the travelers who wanted to worship the gods and sleep comfortably afterward. In northeastern Thailand, two such Khmer temples, Phimai and Phanom Rung, survive. The first of these was begun perhaps as early as the 11th century; both were certainly completed before 1200.   Because of their distance from the capital, the temples are relatively small, but they are handsome nonetheless. And there are few tourists: During my two visits over the last year, there were several groups of Thai schoolchildren at Phanom Rung; very few visitors at all at Phimai. Conveniently, both can be visited in a day's excursion from Korat (also known as Nakhon Ratchasima, which is the name, too, of the province of which this is the main city). The drive through the Thai countryside is picturesque, passing by villages of houses on stilts, a fair complement of water buffaloes, occasional banyans and flame trees, and providing views over the Korat plateau.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Law-Abiding Americans Find Reason to Laud Singapore Justice; Celebrity Awaits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/opinion/l-law-abiding-americans-find-reason-to-laud-singapore-justice-celebrity-awaits-883786.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   One thing your April 10 editorial doesn't mention is what will happen when Michael Fay is returned to the United States.

And, while there may be local business registration fees, 44 states do not require the agent to register the business. In the likely event the agent wanted to sell airline tickets, a certification would be needed, but it is from an industry clearinghouse, the Airlines Reporting Corporation.    Rhode Island is the one state now requiring an examination; 10 other states place some minimal legal requirement on the sale of travel: California, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia and Washington. Some of these states, and Massachusetts, uneasy about a recent rash of defaults and consumer losses, are examining how to tighten the tour-operator business, which produces the multimillion-dollar failures that make headlines, and the travel agency business. Recent Defaults    Two big recent defaults involved the luxury tour operator Hemphill Harris in California in 1989 and the Milestone Education Institute, a Massachusetts student tour operator, in 1993. The Hemphill Harris failure stranded travelers and left luxury hotels with unpaid bills; the total loss is unclear, with estimates ranging from $900,000 up.

Apart from their programmatic aspects -- a narration invoking a black childhood in the 1940's in Donald E. Dillard's \"Childhood Scenes\"; references to a Caribbean island in Daniel Roumain's \"Haitian Essay,\" a musical allusion to blacks who worked at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago in Dolores White's \"Celebration\" -- the pieces were simply examples of various American styles, executed with varying degrees of expertise. Whiffs of jazz and blues and Haitian folk tunes could be heard, but neither these works nor the fourth piece -- Jonathan B. Holland's \"Martha's Waltz,\" inspired by Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" -- attested to a hyphenated identity. At times it seemed that their composers and the others at the symposium were unified only by their apparent lack of interest in black pop culture.   Defining a black American musical tradition for the concert hall was one of the symposium's preoccupations, and it was difficult not to sense that this tradition is now tenuous. Although blacks continue to play crucial roles in jazz, blues, gospel, hip-hop and other popular styles, fewer than 2 percent of orchestral musicians and perhaps only a few dozen classical composers are black. But as Eileen Southern's distinguished work \"The Music of Black Americans\" shows, a long history of black involvement with the concert hall precedes contemporary affirmative action programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Sports, Money, Politics -- A special report.; New Jersey's Sports Empire: New Fields, Hard Times","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/nyregion/sports-money-politics-special-report-new-jersey-s-sports-empire-new-fields-hard.html","abstract":"  The Meadowlands sports complex, rising from swamps and garbage dumps 20 years ago, was a perfect antidote to New Jersey's image as a second-rate place with smelly air and dirty politics.

The landscape proved highly inspirational to Wordsworth, who took most of his poetic cues from nature. Living with his sister, and surrounded by a circle of poets and writers that included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Robert Southey and, later, Thomas De Quincey, Wordsworth enjoyed his most creative years. HOME AT GRASMERE: The Wordsworths and the Lakes (Collins & Brown/Trafalgar Square, $29.95) chronicles this period. Penelope Hughes-Hallett, the author of \"Jane Austen: 'My Dear Cassandra,' \" winds the story around excerpts from William Wordsworth's poems, as well as passages from Dorothy Wordsworth's journals and other letters and writings. She demonstrates that Wordsworth frequently borrowed from his sister's lyrical observations of nature and of the rustic characters who roamed the countryside. William, however, consistently underplayed Dorothy's contribution to his work. Ms. Hughes-Hallett's story, lavishly illustrated in watercolors that capture the extraordinary beauty of the Lake District, offers a glimpse into Dorothy's fanatic devotion to her brother, including her heartache over his marriage. The book is most enticing in its presentation of personal turmoil and tragedy: Coleridge's long addiction to alcohol and drugs, the misunderstandings that wrecked the close relationship between Wordsworth and Coleridge, the deaths in 1812 of two of Wordsworth's children, and, finally, Dorothy's madness. \nCLAUDIA RICCI","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940424","headline":"Knicks Surrender Playoff Advantage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/sports/pro-basketball-knicks-surrender-playoff-advantage.html","abstract":"  After a long regular season in which they faced many obstacles, the Knicks were helpless this afternoon, watching television as two other teams decided their playoff fate.

Ultimately considering whether these animals will survive, the book is \"fun to read and a splendid and much-needed introduction,\" Vicki Hearne said here.  PIGS IN HEAVEN By Barbara Kingsolver.

The child, a Cherokee Indian, was taken in by Taylor after she was left, abused and neglected, on the front seat of Taylor's car; although Turtle was officially adopted, such proceedings are illegal according to the Indian Child Welfare Act if they take place without the tribe's consent.

Available just in the last two weeks to buyers in the United States, the Discovery follows a trend among luxury auto makers, including Mercedes and BMW (which recently bought Rover), to offer vehicles under $30,000 for so-called value-conscious buyers. While Rover's best-known product, the Range Rover, costs upward of $52,000, the slightly smaller Discovery starts at a mere $28,900. That price makes it competitive with other luxury compact sport utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee.   WHERE IT'S BUILT TO BE DRIVEN: The highway, of course, plus everywhere you don't drive your Accord -- through the river, over the woods, across construction sites when no workers or police officers are around. Land-Rovers are engineered to be supreme off-road vehicles. The Discovery's promoters say it can climb 45-degree angles and ford streams almost 20 inches deep.
