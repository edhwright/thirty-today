The injury will probably not need surgery, they said, but will need lots of rehabilitaion and healing time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930324","headline":"Abortion Foes Reject Fanaticism and Violence; Not a Zealot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/24/opinion/l-abortion-foes-reject-fanaticism-and-violence-not-a-zealot-931993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"The Death of Dr. Gunn\" (editorial, March 12): I am not a religious fanatic, I am not a terrorist, I do not picket abortion clinics, and I do not approve of Randall Terry.

Anywhere he wants.   Well, almost. Norio Ogha, the president of Sony Corporation and an avid amateur conductor, will be on the podium at Avery Fisher Hall on May 12 at 7:30 P.M., conducting Beethoven's Seventh and Schubert's \"Unfinished\" symphonies and Strauss's \"Fledermaus\" Overture in a benefit concert for the Lincoln Center Consolidated Corporate Fund. His orchestra is to be billed as Members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, a freelance ensemble drawn largely from the pool of Met players.   But leading a freelance band was not how Sony had hoped Mr. Ogha would make his New York conducting debut. In September, Michael P. Schulhof, the vice chairman of Sony U.S.A., approached the New York Philharmonic about putting his boss on the orchestra's podium, but he made little headway.   \"I cannot comment on that,\" the Philharmonic's managing director, Deborah Borda, said at the time. \"But as a matter of policy, we do not hire the orchestra out, and if there had been any discussions, that's what we would have said.\" A Newcomer? Not Really    Actually, although Mr. Ogha's passion for conducting may at a glance look like dilettantism supported by corporate muscle, he comes to this avocation with a solid musical background. He took both a bachelor's and a master's degree in music from the Tokyo University of Fine Arts in 1954 and then studied voice (he is a baritone) in Munich with Gerhard Husch, the legendary German lieder singer. He earned another music degree in Berlin before returning to Japan and starting a career as a recitalist and opera singer.   \"But even then,\" Mr. Ogha said the other day at Sony's Manhattan headquarters, \"I wanted to be a conductor as well. I studied conducting, score-reading, composition, harmony and counterpoint. I also studied the flute and, starting when I was very young, the piano.\"   In the early 1960's, Mr. Ogha worked for Sony during the day and sang at night, but he gave up his double life after he fell asleep and nearly missed his cue in a performance of \"Le Nozze di Figaro.\"   But his work at Sony kept him in touch with the classical music world. From 1968 until he became Sony's president in 1982, he ran CBS/Sony, the Japanese arm of CBS Records, and in 1987 he oversaw Sony's acquisition of CBS Records. In the late 1970's, when Sony and Philips collaborated on the development of the compact disk, it was Mr. Ogha's idea that the disk be able to accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, at about 74 minutes.   Mr. Ogha began conducting in public in 1990, when he was 60, and has conducted benefit concerts in Tokyo and Germany for the Poland Relief Fund and a handful of arts organizations and festivals. He said he studies his scores every morning from 2:30 to 5. \"That way,\" he said, \"it's on my time, not Sony's time.\" 'A Great Feel for the Music'    Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, saw a video of one of Mr. Ogha's concerts at a demonstration of Sony's high-definition television system in Tokyo in August.   \"He was conducting the Schubert 'Unfinished,' \" Mr. Leventhal recalled. \"It was a very musical performance, very graceful. He obviously had a great feel for the music. So when Mickey Schulhof proposed his conducting a benefit for Lincoln Center, I agreed to it.\"   Still, one senses slight hesitation at Lincoln Center about the idea of a well-connected, enthusiastic amateur conducting on the institution's behalf. Several officials noted pointedly that the concert is a private, philanthropic event, not a Lincoln Center presentation. The proceeds are to be divided among all the Lincoln Center constituents, and David Rivel, Lincoln Center's vice president for marketing, said previous events have typically raised $200,000.   This one will apparently do better than that. Mr. Schulhof said that one of Sony's competitors, Warner Music, has agreed to contribute $100,000 and Sony would donate even more. Sony has also undertaken the task of selling tickets, at $50 to $100. Information: (800) 526-7669.   As for Mr. Ogha, it seems that in purely musical matters he is not entirely a company man. Asked which recording of the Beethoven Seventh is his favorite, he thought for a moment and said that it was Carlos Kleiber's, with the Vienna Philharmonic. On Deutsche Grammophon. Spoleto Skirmish    The Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the arts festival in Charleston, S.C., that seems constitutionally unable to get through a season peaceably, has already logged its first roster-altering dispute of 1993. John Kennedy, the festival's orchestra manager for several years and since 1990 the director of its 20th Century Perspectives series of contemporary music concerts, has resigned because of musical and philosophical differences with Steven Mercurio, the festival's music director.   The disagreement began when Mr. Mercurio, a conductor and composer, suggested that he and Mr. Kennedy share the direction of the three-concert series, which was the only significant exploration of contemporary music offered at last year's festival. Mr. Kennedy said in a telephone interview that although he objected to relinquishing control of the series, he nevertheless discussed some ideas with Mr. Mercurio. But when Mr. Mercurio suggested that works by several neo-Romantic and early 20th-century composers be included in the programs, Mr. Kennedy resolved to leave.   \"It would be impossible for me to forge casual collaborations of 20th- century music with you,\" he wrote to Mr. Mercurio, \"because I consider programming itself to be an act of critical importance. Among the composers you mentioned, I do not feel Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky or George Gershwin needs introduction or advocacy to audiences in the context of my series.\"   Mr. Kennedy added that he did not care for the work of several other composers Mr. Mercurio suggested.   Mr. Mercurio, reached by telephone in Washington, where he was conducting \"Turandot\" at the Washington Opera, said that as a composer he thought he should have a hand in the festival's contemporary component. But he insisted that he offered Mr. Kennedy concessions, among them allowing him a hand in the new-music programming at the parent festival in Spoleto, Italy.   \"He wanted to do a Cage retrospective,\" Mr. Mercurio said, \"and I was willing to give him that concert. It's not as if I was trying to wrest this away from him.\"   Mr. Kennedy said he did not think he had deliberately been pushed out of the festival, and both he and Mr. Mercurio said the festival's founder and artistic director, Gian Carlo Menotti, had no part in the fight.

(AP) SOCCER U.S. Ties El Salvador  The United States tied El Salvador, 2-2, Tuesday night in a game at San Salvador, El Salvador, that cost the Americans the services of defender Erik Imler, who tore ligaments in his right knee. After the hosts went ahead by 1-0, the United States got its goals four minutes apart. Yari Allnutt, who replaced Imler, scored from 12 yards. Sadri Gjonbalaj passed to Mark Chung, who knocked the ball down and sent it to Allnutt, who connected 49 minutes into the game. Midfielder Cobi Jones gave the Americans the lead in the 53d minute. El Salvador, which scored first when Raul Diaz Arce beat goalie Scoop Stanisic in the 29th minute, tied it in the 69th minute. Mauricio Cienfuegos took a diagonal pass from Mayo Gonzalez and beat Stanisic, a 30-year-old making his debut with the United States.

Senior officials in the Reagan and Bush Administrations appear to have suppressed or ignored damning evidence of Salvadoran military complicity in atrocities. Instead, anxious to avoid any cutoff of U.S. aid during El Salvador's 12-year civil war, officials kept assuring Congress that things were getting better.    In fairness, the inquiry should begin in 1980, since dissimulation began under President Carter. It should address not only official attempts to dupe Congress but also efforts to discourage investigation by news organizations.

Even viewers familiar with recent Japanese film at its most iconoclastic may be startled by some of the rebelliousness seen here. The film's central character is an anomaly by definition: a surly young drifter in a society that seemingly places much value on discipline and purpose. \"Original Sin\" takes a slightly awed view of this drifter's utter amorality and self-interest.   The film begins startlingly as this drifter, Makoto (Masatoshi Nagase), glimpses the demurely beautiful Nami (Shinobu Ohtake) at a train station. Almost literally thunderstruck, he watches her through torrential rain that is filmed so slowly and grandiosely it looks like snow.  After this, he feels destined to follow her to the real estate office where she works, and where the boss turns out to be her husband.

With McCoy Tyner's 15-piece big band, the leader's splashy, thick-chorded approach to the piano translates to lush orchestrations in which every register is densely populated: tuba sharing bass lines with the bass, congas meshing rhythms with the trap drums, and brasses (including French horn along with trombones and trumpets) trading melodic sections with saxophones and woodwinds. Harmonies become chorales that use unexpectedly rich chromatic chords, and a prominent flute or piccolo often twitters up above.    The arrangements add detail to the music, but never at the expense of its drive. In Tuesday's second set at the Five Spot (4 West 31st Street, Manhattan), uptempo compositions by Mr. Tyner bustled along, especially \"Fly With the Wind,\" in which a modal vamp and a quasi-African polyrhythm emerged from a rumble of percussion to spur ensembles and solos, then melted into a percussion coda as if to say that rhythm was the music's wellspring.

Still, a ridership of 3.5 million daily descends to this underground gallery of fear, undeterred by visions of scurrying rats, defaced walls, hollow-eyed vagrants and platforms perilously overcrowded or frighteningly vacant. And, in fact, the subterranean picture has brightened considerably in recent years. Remarkably, at a time of national drift away from public amenity toward increased privatization, the subway has been shuttling valiantly in the opposite direction. In the past decade, supported by two five-year programs authorized by the New York State Legislature, the Transit Authority has carried out extensive overhauls of the aging subway system. New cars and tracks. A fully air-conditioned, graffiti-free fleet. Renovated stations.  Beefed-up security. New automated turnstiles (looking something like an airport metal detector crossed with a casino slot machine) that will soon accept plastic fare cards.
