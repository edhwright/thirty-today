Some districts, frustrated by provisions that they regard as ineffective or confusing, have instead been awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of a similar 1990 Federal statute, to which they long ago responded with restrictions that were mostly milder but in some cases far tougher.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950315","headline":"Unconventional History Of the Paris Commune","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/15/books/books-of-the-times-unconventional-history-of-the-paris-commune.html","abstract":"  PARIS BABYLON The Story of the Paris Commune  By Rupert Christiansen  Illustrated. 435 pages.

In fact, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Democratic leader, maintains that every member of his conference supports the notion that able-bodied welfare recipients should work for their benefits.   Where the parties differ is over how to make that happen. Mr. Pataki has proposed a 90-day limit on employable recipients of the welfare program known as Home Relief, most of whom are single, childless adults. During that 90-day period, he would force welfare recipients to work in public-service jobs. Mr. Silver has said he can support the notion of time limits as long as the state provides job-training programs to prepare welfare recipients for the realities of New York's tough job market. SCORECARD    The strategy is to paint Republicans as the agents of change and Democrats as the defenders of the status quo. Few issues help make that case more effectively than welfare. The ground for this mesage is particularly fertile in the upstate and Long Island districts where this ad is running.    Like most political advertising, the ad simplifies the debate. Mr. Pataki's budget is about far more than workfare, and it includes deep spending cuts that may be anathema even to those who support welfare reform. But personalizing the budget debate may prove effective. Every campaign, after all, needs an enemy.

The series, which opened on Monday evening at the Walter Reade Theater, is no longer a forum for new music ensembles of all stripes, as it was during its early years. Now the organization has a house band, the Bang on a Can All-Stars, who play its concerts and make recordings. Only the annual marathon (this year's is on May 21 at Alice Tully Hall) is the kind of omnibus offering that won Bang on a Can attention when it started nine years ago.   That said, the All-Stars are not a bad band by art-rock standards, and one could argue that in taking on all the performing chores, they are presenting a broader repertory than a series of composer-led ensembles would yield. Works by seven composers were played on Monday, and although there were both hits and misses, the program suggested that composers interested in combining elements of rock, jazz, unstructured noise and narrative structure are still finding fresh ground and are apparently feeling entirely unconstrained.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950316","headline":"Ballet Drawn From Danza","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/arts/dance-review-ballet-drawn-from-danza.html","abstract":"  Ballets de San Juan, Puerto Rico's oldest ballet troupe, romped into town for a rare New York appearance on Saturday night and established itself as a company of special charm and warmth.

It seems as if it has been around much longer, like a distant supernova whose light has just reached the eyes of earth. With this work, and with his 15th Symphony, Shostakovich began a new stylistic progression that death immediately cut short. The sonata does not carry forward the anguished personal dramas of the late quartets; it exists on a plane of pure music, conversing with voices out of the past. A ghostly echo of Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" glides through the finale. There is deep melancholy, but also deep repose.   Only a great musician can make sense of these profound simplicities, written at the edge of the grave. Yuri Bashmet made the music entirely his own on Tuesday night in one of the most important Carnegie Hall debuts in recent years. He gave lyric life to the score's endless strings of quarter notes and half notes, and he cast a fiery glow on the few stretches of wildness.

Until this week, many fans of Governor Pataki's calls for austerity lulled themselves into thinking that state aid to the City University and State University of New York could be reduced by nearly a third, with savings achieved from painless tuition increases and a few snips here and there in the mythically bloated administrative bureaucracy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"On My Mind; Kisses for Castro","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/opinion/on-my-mind-kisses-for-castro.html","abstract":"  No question at all, it was a real fun time for the hosts and the guest at the combination house party and political fund-raiser the Mitterrands threw in Paris for Fidel Castro.

The upbeat, brisk video consists of children talking about their favorite elements of New York architecture, and it starts with well-meaning but unsurprising voices of praise for the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center. But then the camera turns to an in-line skater, who is shown barreling at breakneck speed backward down the huge stone steps beside the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. What's the greatest thing about New York? he is asked. \"The stairs,\" he replies without hesitation.    Alex loved this, and not only because he is a skater himself. I suspect it is also because he realized that this was the one moment in this ambitious exhibition in which one could actually see children reinventing the city for themselves. Those monumental stairs have one meaning for their architect, another for the generations who have used them for genteel promenades, and quite another altogether for the in-lane skaters for whom they represent not dignified monumentality, but the athletic challenge of a ski jump. The skaters have powerfully redefined this aspect of the city, not taking it away from the rest of us, but adding a whole new meaning of their own.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"The Bridge Stops Right Here, A Nonunion Builder Is Told","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/nyregion/the-bridge-stops-right-here-a-nonunion-builder-is-told.html","abstract":"  For six months, Dave Allan has been doing everything he can think of to rebuild a bridge on a highway to Jones Beach in time for summer.

It may be becoming so deeply in that it almost renders the very term an oxymoron. Still, an exceptional exhibition at the Swiss Institute in SoHo proves that for Americans at least, some significant surprises and discoveries remain.   This show introduces the art of Heinrich Anton Muller, a Swiss outsider, or self-taught, artist who died in 1930 at the age of 61. He's great, almost on a par with outsider giants like Adolf Wolfli (who was also Swiss), Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger. Muller's work is not a secret in Europe. Even in his lifetime, his large drawings of fantastical figures and animals were known to Hans Prinzhorn, the German psychiatrist who was among the first to write about and preserve the art of the insane. Muller's art received its first gallery exhibition in Paris in 1949 and was admired by Jean Dubuffet, who included it in his art brut collection. It also inspired other French artists, like Daniel Spoerri and Jean Tinguely, who both dedicated artworks to Muller, and was seen in the 1972 Documenta exhibition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"St. Anthony to Meet Shawnee in Final","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/sports/st-anthony-to-meet-shawnee-in-final.html","abstract":"  Anthony Perry scored 14 points, including the game-clinching layup, as third-seeded St. Anthony of Jersey City edged second-seeded Christian Brothers Academy, 55-52, in a New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association Tournament of Champions semifinal tonight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950317","headline":"Secretary of Transportation Will Not Face a Prosecutor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/us/secretary-of-transportation-will-not-face-a-prosecutor.html","abstract":"  Attorney General Janet Reno said today that she had dropped an inquiry into Transportation Secretary Federico F.
