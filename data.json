Could blacks on television be palatable if they were anything less than Rhodes scholars who speak seven languages, like Bill Cosby on \"I Spy,\" or the properly powdered nurse Julia?   Most seasons, old stereotypes pass for shorthand sociology, broken only by contrarian moments like \"Roots\" or \"The Cosby Show.\" Now, after the success of street movies like \"Boyz N the Hood,\" television, particularly in a few bold steps by HBO, is making black dramas with the highest production values and an edgy pseudorealism, in which violence and pathology are inherent in being black and crack is a required character.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930815","headline":"White House Memo; Weary Clinton Takes Break From His Own Frenetic Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/us/white-house-memo-weary-clinton-takes-break-from-his-own-frenetic-style.html","abstract":"  After a whirlwind first stretch that has lasted seven long months, President Clinton has finally gone on vacation today.

In \"Grand Street Brides\" (1954), loosely and vigorously drawn in a style reminiscent of Willem de Kooning and John Graham, six towering women are in some danger of being overwhelmed by isolation, overpainting and revisions.   \"Hand-Painted Pop: American Art in Transition, 1955-62\" (a show of more than 100 works by 21 artists, on view through Oct. 10) means to prove that Pop Art was not an abrupt break with Abstract Expressionism but a slow evolution during which artists combined gestural brushwork with representations based on popular culture.

The bones of his wrists and hands are distorted and in places his skin is badly discolored. The disease has also caused his left foot to swell to nearly twice its normal size. A toe has been amputated. He must use a walker, which he calls \"my tricycle,\" to go from room to room in his house in Albuquerque, N.M. Getting into cars and dealing with stairs is a slow and difficult business. He depends on drugs like Percocet to work, but they aren't always effective, and he can't predict how bad the pain will be from one day to the next. That makes him say, \"I've lived too long.\" Five times in recent years he has had to be taken to the hospital in emergencies. There are days when even the delicate resistance of the keys of his computer is unbearable.\n\nYet for the last 15 years Henry Roth, a writer at least as famous for his agonizing case of writer's block as for his legendary novel, \"Call It Sleep,\" has defied his physical and psychological afflictions. He has worked on a vast project of autobiographical fiction called \"Mercy of a Rude Stream.\" Mr. Roth has completed five books, each with a separate title, totaling 3,200 pages. The first of these, \"A Star Shines Over Mount Morris Park,\" will be published by St. Martin's Press in January 1994.

Thursday to Tuesday, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturdays, to 10 P.M. Through Aug. 30. \n\nStrong images and a high-impact theme combine to make this a particularly substantial exhibition. Its thesis, the distorted interpretations of American Indians that began in the 19th century, is developed by placing paintings, drawings, prints and photographs that contributed to stereotypes next to recent art by tribal members. \n\nThe new work is intended to project the Indian experience and ideology more accurately. In a number of instances, the artist comments directly on what is offensive in the earlier piece.\n\nOrganized by Bridget Goodbody with Renee Fotouhi, the exhibition has work by contemporaries with major reputations, including Carl Beam, Edgar Heap of Birds, Fritz Scholder, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Kay WalkingStick and Phil Young.\n\nEthnographic interpretations, land attitudes, spirituality and identity are some of the issues explored. Usually, the messages are clear, but wall texts further underscore the show's politics. A marked degree of stylistic boldness emphasizes the passion in the arguments for revisionism.\n\nOne section suggests that the traditional 19th-century expansive landscape scene depicting a seamless harmony between the Indian's world and nature is an erroneous myth. A more intense and symbolic view, represented by Ms. WalkingStick's paintings, transforms cliffs into paired, magical abstract signs and translates earth into a rough, raw, highly visceral and physical surface.\n\nIn one of the most striking paintings, \"Indian Horse,\" Ms. Quick-to-See Smith takes on the famous George Catlin, expressing her rage over the artifice in his images by including copies of his drawings and then painting over them. \n\nThere is a comparable mastery of vigorously expressive techniques in two fine pieces by Carl Beam. They also manipulate borrowed images to invent visual metaphors for recognition and nonrecognition of the Indian presence in American society.\n\nTelling contrasts in smaller pieces include David Neel's photograph of a tribal chief in contemplative pose, with eyes lowered and hands clasped.  This is beside a 1917 contrived image of a tribal member gazing outward toward some distant mystical spirit.\nMilton Avery and \"Magnum Opus\"\n Vered Gallery, 66 Park Place, East Hampton. Daily, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Through Aug. 26. \n\nAdmirers of Milton Avery (1885-1965) and his synthesized experiences of nature know that he had such an open approach to what he chose to distill, simplify and rework that it is always possible to come upon surprise paintings. \n\nOne of these, a dark, stacccato, angular interpretation of surf and rocks, is a highlight of this exhibition.  In some respects, it recalls the influence of German Expressionism in drypoints that the artist had made 20 years earlier.\n\nAvery looked for a magic that he called \"radiance,\" and usually achieved this effect by allowing his arbitrarily colored surfaces and forms to seem saturated with light.  Luminosity and tone usually take precedence over description. The large \"Sand Bar and Sea,\" with its vibrant flat, yellow shape suggesting the sand bar, is a good example.\n\nIn addition to the oil paintings, there is a sizable group of watercolors that touch on four decades and tend to call attention to how well-suited Avery's goals were to that medium. \"Tall Pines\" is a striking example of his reduction of images to a kind of semi-symbolism, while \"Evening Light\" and \"Breaking Wave\" reveal how close he could come to totally abstract effects.\n\nIn \"Magnum Opus,\" 30 examples from a distinguished photography collection show enough of the medium's pivotal history to convey the sense of developing visual codes.  With the earliest years especially, one realizes that this material was part of a revolution in ways of seeing and ways of retaining information.\n\nThe survey begins with W. H.Fox Talbot's handsome 1844 calotype \"Articles of China,\" an image that vibrates with historic resonance, and reaches to Cecil Beaton's crisp and moving 1954 view of a Grand Street bridal shop.\n\nApart from the artistic and technical achievements here, the range of subjects demonstrates the camera's contribution to information and intellectual discourse. The value of genre themes, for example, is presented in John Thompson's dramatically composed scene of activities aboard a Chinese junk in 1868. There are also images that capture horrors of the Civil War, beautiful details of Yellowstone, revelations of archeology and characterisics of exotic journeys.\n\nIn a different sense, Harold Edgerton's 12-part sequence featuring a tiny droplet, from 1935, can be considered a landmark inspirational piece, for it claims an abstract and conceptual role for photograpy.\n Rebecca Alston\n Elise Goodheart Fine Arts, 61 Island View Drive, Sag Harbor. Friday to Monday, noon to 5 P.M. Through Aug. 23. \n\nMs. Alston makes a good try at updating and giving new vitality to the constructivist mode that had a significant theoretical and philosophical impact earlier in the century. The range of her ideas is impressive, even though the sense of detachment inherent in the geometric approach seems out of step just now.\n\nClear, crisp definitions and diagonal forces are basic to these paintings and wall reliefs, with every angle important in developing the dynamic tension that serves as a subject.\n\nWith strong, unpredictable color and a variety of textures, Ms. Alston seems to test how inventive one can be with a restricted vocabulary. To her credit, she injects a lightness and playfulness into what is usually a serious, humorless approach. \n\nShe may base a relief on a regular grid, then suddenly allow layers of superimposed shapes to thrust out with no respect for boundaries. Another work might solidify shadows and turn them into geometric schemes, and still another might tip forward unexpectedly. Here Ms. Alston might be considered part of the contemporary spirit in the way she suggests irony.\n\nAn obvious confidence with space of every type is one of the artist's strong points. A more open piece, closer to wall-mounted sculpture, is a particularly successful departure. Its flame-like protrusion introduces greater complexity and brings a hint of emotion to what is usually considered an abstraction of reason.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930815","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/style/c-corrections-443493.html","abstract":"  A caption in the Evening Hours column last Sunday about a party to help preserve mansions in Newport, R.I., refered incorrectly to the architect of one, the Elms.

Citywalk is not in a class with the first-rate buildings Los Angeles architects have produced in recent years. It's in a class with the \"Psycho\" house. Though created by the Jerde Partnership, a Los Angeles architectural firm, Citywalk's zippy collage of signs and storefronts is more likely to be nominated for an Oscar than for a Pritzker. No one would mistake the mall's overscaled facades for a row of storefronts.

The group quickly gained notoriety with a British public used to what Sickert contemptuously called the \"lilies and languors\" of Pre-Raphaelite sentimentality by painting tired working-class faces in cramped North London flats, bawdy performers at seedy music halls and moody cityscapes. Sickert's grim subjects (as in \"The Camden Town Murder,\" where a fleshy woman lies sprawled on a dingy cot, her throat cut) and his disturbing palette of dirty yellow-ochers, dusty blues and sickly greens are thought to have paved the way for the severe, pessimistic art of contemporary British painters like Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon. While Sickert's influence on modern English art is well established, his own artistic evolution has been neglected. The publication of SICKERT: Paintings (Yale University, $60), edited by Wendy Baron, director of the British Government Art Collection, and by Richard Shone, associate editor of The Burlington Magazine, fills that gap and more. The excellently researched and handsomely produced volume details Sickert's nocturnal expeditions by the edge of the Thames with Whistler, the artist's friendship with Degas, and his great admiration for the French realists Millet and Courbet. What emerges is a portrait of a man fiercely determined to change the course of British art, motivated by the resigned belief that, as he wrote in 1908, \"for some reasons to me hidden and inscrutable, the genius of painting still hovers over Paris, and must be wooed on the banks of the Seine.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930815","headline":"DINING OUT;\nBroader Chinese Menu in Thornwood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/nyregion/dining-out-broader-chinese-menu-in-thornwood.html","abstract":"TOUCHES of red, black and gold brighten the large contemporary dining room of Hunan Ritz, set in the center of the Rose Hill Shopping Center.

The evening I set off, as the sun went down behind the mountains that ring Morelia, I could feel a crick in my back just thinking about the five-hour ride.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930815","headline":"Nigerian Runner Disputes Drug Report","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/sports/track-and-field-nigerian-runner-disputes-drug-report.html","abstract":"  The German newspaper Suddeutsche-Zeitung reported today that Nigeria's four world-class sprinters had tested positive for the use of banned drugs.

Ramiro Zaragoza, the young lawyer in charge, hired 33 inspectors, outfitted them in green windbreakers and began training them to take on the malfeasants. In Mexico City, officials announced a new dawn in the country's fight against pollution, new proof that if Mexico was allowed to join Canada and the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement it would not sacrifice its environment to attract business across the border. Toxic Legacy of Decades    But in Tijuana it was not that easy. Other agencies would not lend their files on the city's 700 industrial plants, officials in and outside the enforcement office say. Laboratory studies could not be done for lack of equipment or supplies. Then, for five months and without explanation, paychecks did not arrive. Mr. Zaragoza says he is as determined as ever, but only five of his inspectors are still on the job.   \"We've been bluffing,\" he said, sitting behind his desk and doing his best to smile. \"If they knew how few people we had, they would just laugh at us.\"   Faced with the toxic legacy of four decades of almost unregulated industrialization and desperate to win approval for the pending trade agreement, Mexico has taken extraordinary measures in the last few years to strengthen its environmental controls.   On Friday, Mexico, Canada and the United States also announced supplemental accords intended to insure the enforcement of Mexican labor and environmental standards under the agreement, which would eliminate most barriers to trade and investment among the three countries.   Supporters of the trade pact say the side accords will force compliance by investing three-nation labor and environment commissions with the power to impose fines and trade sanctions as penalties of last resort against Mexican violators. The proposed arbitration process is complicated and long, however, and many environmentalists emphasize that it will ultimately be up to the Mexican Government to see that its goal of rapid economic development for the country's 84 million people does not come at an enormous environmental cost. The Problem Is Huge    But despite hundreds of new inspectors, millions of dollars in environmental projects and many speeches by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declaring Mexico's commitment to protecting the environment, even some in the Government acknowledge that the country has only started, somewhat haltingly, to confront a problem of staggering proportions.   \"We have just begun to scratch the surface of what needs to be done,\" said the director of the National Institute of Ecology, Sergio Reyes Lujan.   Mexican ecological laws are viewed by many environmentalists as good and getting better. But a close look at Government environmental programs suggests that those laws are being undermined for reasons that may persist despite the new threat of trade sanctions.   While new environmental inspectors have fanned out across Mexico, their work continues to be hampered by insufficient and uncertain resources, political considerations and, at least occasionally, by corruption. Where the Government has cracked down on polluting industries, it has barely started to follow up with alternatives for those put out of business or incentives for steady compliance. Glaring Lack of Services    Strategies to limit the use of hazardous materials or otherwise prevent pollution are almost unheard of. And the public disclosure of information about companies' environmental practices is almost unimaginable.   As officials evoke images of a vast consumer market with boundless opportunities for investment, Mexico's lack of basic environmental services is glaring: in the Valley of Mexico, home to the capital and some 16 million people, almost nine-tenths of the waste water still goes untreated, according to Government figures. For some 60,000 industrial companies, there is a single toxic-waste landfill. There are no commercial incinerators for toxic wastes.   Mr. Reyes, a blunt-spoken physicist who has led Mexico's environmental efforts since 1986, can recall an agency that performed no inspections, did not even measure the air in Mexico City and got its first computer when he borrowed it from his 21-year-old son.  He is astonished by \"the rate of change,\" a phrase that has become his public mantra. The Border The Boom Is Clear, So's the Blight    Public debate in the United States is being driven largely by the experience of the border, where Government promises of a better tomorrow have a long, bitter past. Here, the dangers have already been vivid for two decades, as Mexico has drawn hundreds of foreign-owned industrial plants, called maquiladoras, with tariff, tax and other incentives.   In Ciudad Juarez, the problems are as plain as the great brown banks of smog that drift across the Rio Grande into El Paso, Tex. Elsewhere, they are sometimes less visible but more frightening: In Brownsville, Tex., an inexplicably high incidence of babies who are delivered stillborn without brains has led people to suspect contamination from industries just across the border in Matamoros, where the same phenomenon has appeared.   One fear that American environmentalists draw from the industrial boom along the border is that freer trade will mean more traffic, more industry and thus more pollution. But that focus underscores how little the accord's potential impact has been studied and how narrowly it has been seen.   Some economists believe that the crush of industry along the border could actually diminish under the agreement. But scant attention has been paid to the possible environmental effects on the Mexican interior of new activity in areas like agriculture, mining and forestry.   The new \"U.S.A.-style\" dry-cleaning outlets popping up around Mexico City hint at the vast range of problems. Unlike American dry cleaners, which are closely monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, nearly all the Mexican operations dump their hazardous wastes in the trash, a franchise manager, Alberto Shamosh, said. He told of searching for months and then paying dearly to have a waste company from Guadalajara take away his chemical sludge.   Upholding the demands of some American environmental groups for a fuller accounting of the trade agreement's effects, a Federal judge ordered the Clinton Administration last month to provide a complete environmental impact assessment. The Administration has appealed the decision, which could delay carrying out the pact well beyond Jan. 1, when it is supposed to take effect. A ruling on the appeal is expected in late September.   Hoping to dispel pressure for such a study, the Bush Administration released a report last year dismissing the other major fear of American environmentalists: that a trade agreement might turn Mexico into a haven for industries trying to escape tougher environmental regulations to the north.   Environmental Protection Agency officials acknowledge that some furniture manufacturers, automobile paint shops and other businesses have already moved to Mexico for just this reason. They insist, though, that cheaper labor and lower environmental-regulation costs might defray the expense of relocation only for a tiny handful of industries that could be easily controlled. The Newcomers Laws Are Flouted, Reforms Touted    Tijuana is not convinced.   \"They have come here from all over, saying they are going to invest, that they are going to help us,\" said Maurilio Sanchez, a community organizer in Ejido Chilpancingo, a dusty sprawl of tarpaper and brick that sits just below a big maquiladora park on the city's outskirts. \"But when it comes to complying with the ecological laws, they say they cannot speak Spanish.\"    For the most part, Mr. Sanchez said, the authorities ignore him. But they have been paying more attention since March 8, when sewer openings in the neighborhood exploded and he led a clutch of firemen and inspectors to a waste recycling business in the industrial park.   Just as the posse arrived, the company's owner and two workers were pouring barrels of toxic chemicals down a sewer drain. Investigators concluded that they had been doing so for years.   By law, the foreign-owned plants are obliged to ship their hazardous wastes back out of Mexico for disposal. In practice, officials say, there is a flourishing traffic in waste-dumping. A United States Congressional study last year found that fewer than one-third of the plants even reported on their wastes as required and that the reports went virtually unchecked.   Compared with even two years ago, Mexican officials assert, their ability to track and control such problems has taken a giant leap forward.   At one point in 1991, according to Government figures, the country's environmental agency had seven inspectors assigned to 15,000 industries in Mexico City. Under the new agency set up last fall, the office of the Attorney General for Environmental Protection, inspections officially jumped from 1,380 in all of 1989 to 6,937 in the first four months of this year.   While many environmentalists consider those figures suspect, there is no dispute that tens of millions of dollars have been committed to new sewage treatment plants, new landfills, new air-quality monitoring programs. More than 200 new environmental regulations are being written or rewritten with the help of international consultants. The Inspectors Paltry Resources (And No Paycheck)    In their campaign to push the trade accord through the American Congress this fall, Mexican and American officials have promised to channel billions more dollars to clean up both sides of the 2,000-mile border. And World Bank officials say they will lend as much as $600 million to support Mexico's environmental projects and agencies over the next several years.   But to follow two conscientious young federal inspectors on their rounds is to wonder about the effectiveness of the new force.   Puttering up Tijuana's hills in a Volkswagen bug, the inspectors -- Aidee Solano, clad in her green windbreaker and jeans, and Carlos Padilla, clad in just the jeans -- make their way to Bronzart S.A., a maker of bronze statuettes that moved in eight months ago from Southern California.   They tell the plant manager they simply want to take a look around, see the manufacturing process, check on the disposal of wastes.   \"Just like in Los Angeles,\" he says, \"right?\"   But after that welcome comparison, the manager indicates that he expected things to be a little different. Unlike in California, he has not bothered to clean out his waste water or have it treated. He is not sure what to do with the refuse from his smelting operation, he says, so it is piled up in a big mound behind the plant.   Shouting over the roar of machines, Miss Solano, who studied biology in college, questions a supervisor about the chemicals in the big drums. She asks for and receives information on each, but does not bother with samples; there is no laboratory to perform the analysis.   After five months without a paycheck, it seems heroic that the inspectors show up for work at all. In similar straits, two inspectors in the Ciudad Juarez office were recently dismissed after complaints that they unsuccessfully solicited big bribes at a local engine plant.    The head of the Juarez office was dismissed as well. But according to some Mexican and American environmental officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, his more serious failing may have been to push hard for inspections against the wishes of superiors afraid of angering local businessmen on the eve of a national presidential campaign.   Government officials denied that charge. They do not dispute, however, that the minister in charge of development programs and environmental affairs, Luis Donaldo Colosio, is considered a leading contender for the governing party's nomination and many of his subordinates campaign intensely, if quietly, on his behalf.  The Prospects Some Pray the Pact Will Bring Converts    Much as they have complained about the shortcomings of Mexican enforcement, many environmentalists acknowledge that more rigorous inspection of manufacturing plants is only one of the needed improvements in the country's environmental controls. \"The question is whether, when the factories reopen, anything has really changed,\" J. Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, said in an interview in Washington.   Among the statistics that Salinas Administration officials routinely hand out, there is no count of follow-up inspections. Efforts are under way to make industries pay for their own waste treatment, and in what supporters of the trade agreement hail as a sign of the environmental cooperation it will encourage, Mexican officials and Los Angeles County prosecutors in June forced an American company to pay $2.5 million to clean up lead wastes from the battery-recycling plant it operated outside Tijuana.   But for now, pollution-prevention efforts are almost nonexistent, and incentive-based solutions to specific pollution problems are just getting off the drawing board.   In a 1991 study often quoted by Mexican officials, two Princeton University economists, Gene M. Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, conclude that \"economic growth tends to alleviate pollution problems once a country's per capita income reaches about $4,000 to $5,000\" -- Mexico's level now.   To many Mexican and American environmentalists, the study, prepared for a conference sponsored by the Mexican trade ministry, smacks of wishful thinking. But if changing attitudes is more complex a matter than the average amount of money in people's pockets, more and more American environmentalists have come to support the trade pact on the ground that it might strengthen Mexicans' environmental awareness along with their economy.   Just across from El Paso, where the pressure is building for binational solutions to the air-pollution problem, a brickmaker in Ciudad Juarez, Pedro Gonzalez, lent support for this thesis. He was describing the Government's insistence that he stop burning tires and sawdust in his kiln and start burning propane gas.   \"The truth is, all of this is happening because the gabachos are pressuring us,\" he said of the move toward cleaner fuels, using slang for Americans. \"But we have families, too. The owners may not care. But we have to live here.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930816","headline":"Tennis Brings Life To Part of New York","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/16/sports/tennis-tennis-brings-life-to-part-of-new-york.html","abstract":"  \"The Bronx has been too many people's prop for too long,\" said Borough President Fernando Ferrer. \"It's always somebody's photo op, somebody's victory, somebody's chance to put blame on everything that's wrong with the world.\"   He surveyed Crotona Park, sprawling languid and green in the heart of the South Bronx on this warm, sweet Friday afternoon. \"The Bronx is about good people who haven't given up, who've stuck it out.
