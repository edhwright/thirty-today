The Russian, confident and cruelly efficient, won in good stride. The score of the 24-game series is getting one-sided, now at 3 1/2- 1/2 in favor of Kasparov.   Short started the encounter bristling with aggression, putting on the board one of the most demanding speculative attacks known to the game. There was defiance in that: Kasparov is the foremost exponent of the defensive and counterattacking methods of shooting down such bold enterprise. But the Englishman refused to retrench.

Should they drink to protect their hearts or not drink to reduce their risk of breast cancer?   As evidence mounts for the protective effect of moderate drinking against heart disease in both men and women, it is also accumulating for the potential hazards of even one drink a day to the breasts. To decide how to reconcile these opposing effects, it helps to understand the nature of the evidence and the relative risks of the two diseases.

But it presents the evidence in an explosive way.   Most of \"Our Kids, Armed and Dangerous\" focuses on Chicago. The camera enters a hospital emergency room, the homes of young killers and their victims, and a West Side church whose priest is trying to teach children that fights can be settled without guns. The camera does most of the work here, especially as it moves in close on hospital trauma teams trying to save lives of youngsters who have scarcely started to live, like the paralyzed 14-year-old who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930915","headline":"PREMIER OF QUEBEC TO QUIT IN JANUARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/15/world/premier-of-quebec-to-quit-in-january.html","abstract":"  Premier Robert Bourassa, who has governed Quebec for almost three decades and has struggled against cancer for the last three years, announced today that he would retire after the Liberal Party leadership convention in January.

The delay results from a challenge to the dancer's will that has been filed by Nureyev's sister and niece, who live in Paris.   The auctions had been scheduled to take place at Christie's in London on Dec. 17 and 18 and in Manhattan on Jan. 19 and 20. Christie's said Nureyev family members have been questioning what will be sold and what will be included in an exhibition that is to open in Paris in the next year. In addition to the foundations Nureyev started, he wanted a museum in his memory. What should go into such a museum is apparently also a matter of contention.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930916","headline":"Eye on Olympics, China Pursues Air Safety","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/world/eye-on-olympics-china-pursues-air-safety.html","abstract":"  Worried that its effort to become the host to the 2000 Olympic Games could be undermined by safety concerns among foreigners who fly on China's airlines, Chinese aviation authorities have announced a major crackdown on safety violations.

Going into his final year at Pitt in 1991, he was considered one of the top pass rushers in college, but something happened on the way to becoming a first-rounder. He was tagged as a problem child, a big-time talent minus the work ethic.

Mr. Mamikonian, a 23-year-old Armenian pianist who has studied with Jorg Demus and Lazar Berman -- polar opposites, one would think -- demonstrated a technique that combines power and gracefulness, an ear for stylistic nuance and flashes of interpretive ingenuity.

Guru, who is half the hard-core hip-hop duo Gang Starr, is known for his monotonal and blase delivery and thoughtful if raw lyrics. The show, like his own album, \"Jazzmatazz Vol. 1,\" is Guru's attempt at fusing jazz and hip-hop. The two genres, often compared because of their similar origins, existed symbiotically onstage. Each was clearly if only slightly changed by the other.  It was an easy fusion, almost as if the fuss over it is unwarranted.\n\nBy the time the band went into \"Transit Ride,\" a lyrical tour of New York's subways, the band had melded. Guru was on point with one of his best songs and the horn section, highlighted by the sweet-sounding hollowness of Donald Byrd's trumpet, was blowing in rich unison.

Maybe a little too perfectly. Anyone coming to this show expecting to find the emotional gravity of the 17th-century Baroque golden age will be disappointed. The silver age that followed, at least as represented in these watercolors, asked something different of its artists: polish rather than depth, and a secular, rational light in place of the spiritual dramas of chiaroscuro. Drama itself, in fact, seems to have gone out of fashion. Clouds pile up in the skies, the star-crossed lovers of classical myth appear, but there is little sign of storms or hearts breaking. The only real narratives are illustrated scenes from popular stage farces, and the emblems of transience that ran like a subtle bass note throughout Dutch painting of an earlier day find little place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Mexico Takes Giant Steps Toward a New Era","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/opinion/l-mexico-takes-giant-steps-toward-a-new-era-214393.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Whatever one's view of the North American Free Trade Agreement, your pages have largely overlooked Mexico's moves toward fundamental political change since the country's 1988 electoral trauma.

Looking at the images she has made over the last 28 years, 66 of which form a spare and illuminating exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, it also seems likely that Ms. Celmins helped set the stage for the highly artificialized realism that permeated the art of the 1980's.

Politicians have spoken so loudly and so often on the free-trade agreement that the economists seem to have been pushed into the background.

Nigel Hawthorne, who plays the monarch who lost America in \"The Madness of George III,\" makes it easy. His astonishing performance, a cascading flow of endearing bluster, hot rage and scalding tears, begins where his dry comedic turn in television's \"Yes, Minister\" leaves off; it makes his Tony Award-winning portrait of C. S. Lewis in \"Shadowlands\" look like a cameo. Who could not love a ruler who merges the accessible, everyman's nobility of Ralph Richardson with the plebeian, jocular vulgarity of Mel Brooks?   The play that provides the springboard for Mr. Hawthorne's triumph is by Alan Bennett, who is arguably the best playwright in England whose major works remain unproduced in the American theater. \"The Madness of George III\" is not one of those major works, but it would be silly to complain too much about a play that gives audiences a chance to savor an unforgettable performance. And it's easy to see why \"George III,\" in its original Royal National Theater production directed by Nicholas Hytner, has been sent on American tour while tougher Bennett works like \"Single Spies\" and \"Talking Heads\" have been limited to piecemeal presentation on public television. With its 18th-century pomp and circumstance, large cast, flourishes of Handel and opulent rustle of costumes, \"George III\" is more readily marketable as the sort of Broadway entertainment the Colonies are thought to prefer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930917","headline":"Smith (1-0), Cowboys (0-2) Come to Terms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/17/sports/pro-football-smith-1-0-cowboys-0-2-come-to-terms.html","abstract":"  It took a while for Jerry Jones to see the handwriting on the scoreboard, and even then he had to swallow twice.
