The new definition is expected to help both researchers and clinicians separate chronic fatigue syndrome from a host of other conditions that can cause prolonged fatigue and that would require more specific therapy.

In \"A New World Christmas,\" the program he presented on Monday evening at Gould Hall, his goal seemed to be not simply a pleasing compilation of Christmas songs but also a program that drew on the full spread of his repertory purview.   Because Mr. Cohen's field of study now runs from medieval Europe to late 19th-century rural America, accomplishing this goal within the \"New World\" scope required some sleight of hand. One could, for example, include the Spanish composer Tomas Luis de Victoria's setting of \"Ave Regina caelorum\" on the grounds that it was also sung in colonial Mexico, but that would open the door to a large part of the Old World repertory and, one would think, invalidate the theme.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941221","headline":"Nets Find Cool Way To Score A Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/21/sports/basketball-nets-find-cool-way-to-score-a-victory.html","abstract":"  In accordance with the new National Basketball Association rules, forearms and elbows are not flying frequently.

Described by witnesses as a \"living hell,\" it killed 188 panicked and screaming workers, of whom 174 were women and teen-age girls. It was the worst industrial fire in history, its death toll surpassing the 146 workers who were killed in the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire in New York in 1911.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941221","headline":"Giuliani Plans To Trim OTB To Cut Losses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/21/nyregion/giuliani-plans-to-trim-otb-to-cut-losses.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

Nearly 40 pieces were played, with Monday night's program at Avery Fisher Hall digging deep into Armstrong's rarely performed orchestral works and Saturday's at Alice Tully Hall working through the revolutionary early works of Armstrong and King Oliver, among others. It is difficult music, and not just for Armstrong's trumpet parts; the pre-swing rhythms are hard to make come alive, and the orchestral works, even the barest ones, were often complicated by show-biz virtuosity.   But something happened in Lincoln Center's pursuit of Armstrong: he appeared, but only in the form of a shadow, and his vague presence pointed out a great flaw in the whole repertorial endeavor. While it is clear that the music of certain historical figures -- Duke Ellington, for example -- is ideal for the modern concert hall, depending mainly on the accurate reproduction of music found on records or in scores, the process falls short for others.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"A Dublin Dreamer Confronts Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/movies/film-review-a-dublin-dreamer-confronts-reality.html","abstract":"Middle-aged Dublin bus conductor and Wilde's &quot;Salome.&quot; Warm little charmer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"The Neediest Cases; Opening Home and Hearts to Disabled Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-opening-home-and-hearts-to-disabled-children.html","abstract":"  In Zafar Ahmed's native country, Pakistan, neglected children are usually sent to live with relatives.

But nine years after she entered New York City's foster care system as an infant, she remains ineligible for adoption because her parents' legal claim to her still has not been cut off.   Another little girl has been taken from her mother three times, the last time when she was 4, emaciated and suffering from ringworm, but it was not until she was 7 that the city decided that she should not go back to her mother. She has spent 8 of her 9 years in foster care, but like the first child, she has no immediate prospect of finding a permanent home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"Frenzied Passengers, Their Hair and Clothes in Flames, Flee Burning Train","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/nyregion/subway-firebomb-scene-frenzied-passengers-their-hair-clothes-flames-flee-burning.html","abstract":"  Through smoke, screams and heat, Mary McMurry tried to dash out of the packed subway train as soon as she heard the explosion and saw the flash of flames in the car behind her.

Mike Passell of Dallas, sitting South, underled the ace of spades, deceived the declarer and defeated the contract.   A tricky defense involving the spade suit occurred in a different context at another table. South became the declarer in three spades, after opening in third seat and a take-out double by West. It would seem that three spades is sure to succeed, since the bidding has suggested that West has the heart queen. South, it seems, will lose a trump trick, a diamond and two clubs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"French Yacht Racer Arrives in Sydney","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/sports/french-yacht-racer-arrives-in-sydney.html","abstract":"  The French solo sailor Christophe Auguin arrived in Sydney, Australia, yesterday after having been stalled out for two days in light winds.

The danger lies, instead, in continuing Mr. Berlusconi's efforts to impede a judicial investigation into corrupt ties between politics and business.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941223","headline":"The Cirque d'Hiver : A Big-Top Tradition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/23/style/IHT-the-cirque-dhiver-a-bigtop-tradition.html","abstract":"Before circuses became synonymous with tents, the first shows in the 18th century were usually held in buildings designed for them - theater-in-the-round, you might say.

It proves, not surprisingly, that jazz, Armstrong's primary cultural legacy, is hardly at its best in the exhibition format. But Armstrong's talent, personality and achievement, not to mention his expressive physiognomy and innate sense of style, created secondary legacies of a more visual sort, most notably in photography, and both jazz in general and his music inspired visual artists of numerous styles and generations.   As a result, this show, which has been organized by Marc H.

A tiny tugboat goes chugging past, nosing a huge black barge forward with an important air. In its wake comes an even bigger vessel, which has just sailed halfway across the world to duck under the Queensboro Bridge. From the Water Club, which looks across to the flat and uneventful landscape of Queens, the East River has a solid, workaday air quite unlike the view from the other side. Waterfront restaurants in Queens and Brooklyn look toward Manhattan, and the light-festooned skyline wraps ships in an aura of romance, but from the Water Club each seems to move purposefully past, bent on a mission.   This works to the Water Club's advantage: While many waterside restaurants attempt a hokey romanticism, the Water Club has a straightforward American quality that is very appealing. The long simple room is hung with nautical banners and models of sailing ships that send the eye right back to the windows and the river outside. The service has the same pleasant simplicity; it is solicitous without being overwhelming. The kitchen is also at its best when it sticks to the basics; when the food becomes too complicated it often loses its appeal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941223","headline":"Keep in Mind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/23/arts/keep-in-mind.html","abstract":"   HOLIDAY HAPPENINGS, featuring \"Sounds Fun,\" an exhibition of larger-than-life interactive instruments and sculptures (presented by the Children's Museum of Manhattan and others); 24 costumed and animated dolls representing different countries; blown-glass sculptures by Dale Chihuly, and an international children's art exhibition sponsored by the United States Committee for Unicef.

Having participated in trials lasting longer than four months, I fault the lawyers for both sides in that case, not the jurors. So too should the judge share part of the responsibility if the jurors had not been prepared at the outset for the anticipated length of the trial.   In recent years, many trials have extended well beyond four months, and in virtually all cases, verdicts were arrived at. I am not aware of any litigation that was compromised because of juror disenchantment; in extended cases I am familiar with, jurors, having been prepared, served with distinction.   It is to be hoped that the jurors in your article who feel their time was wasted will not be dissuaded from serving on a jury again. While many will be quick to criticize our system of trial by jury, we who work within that system rely on the participation of ordinary citizens who agree to serve as the ultimate judges of the facts. Those who criticize this system have yet to propose a viable alternative.

Beyond showing off the prurience that has passed for artistic candor in Mr. Altman's recent work (most notably \"Short Cuts\"), this sequence has another unintended effect. It's a reminder that if \"Ready to Wear\" has stripped anything bare, it's the director's methods that are embarrassingly exposed. Mr. Altman is his own naked emperor this time.   Although an all-star swipe at the fashion trade may have sounded tailor-made for Mr. Altman, his laissez-faire satirical style proves ineffectual for shooting fish in this barrel. Fashion is too self-conscious to be skewered so casually. It's more willfully absurd than the worlds of film (\"The Player\"), country music (\"Nashville\") or campaign politics (\"Tanner '88\"), and it calls for a sharp scalpel.
