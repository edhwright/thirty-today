This work, a Circle Repertory Company production at the Brooks Atkinson Theater on Broadway, is set mostly among the towering redwoods in Northern California where untold thousands of Vietnam veterans have disappeared into a feral, ghostly existence, their only contact with civilization an occasional visit to town for an odd job or a meal scarfed from a garbage can.

The other is a Butoh dancer, Min Tanaka. He is seemingly clad in layers of clay, wearing a stiff earthen mask, miming the doomed ruler's every gesture or enacting his history in formalized gestures. He is a lifesize puppet, a mirror of Oedipus, the Theban king who is himself a sort of puppet, forced into a tragic snare set by the gods.    But as the horrifying truth of Oedipus's past comes to light, the clay shell around Mr. Tanaka is shed, leaving a vulnerable, nearly naked man: the only human figure free of elaborate costume and cosmetic trappings in the entire film. He who has been so blind to himself blinds himself. We see shredded strips of blood-red ribbon hanging on his face. Groping, with a blank stare, he stumbles under the scaffolding and ramps that compose the somber stage set, until he is walking knee-deep in a pool of dark water, surrounded by ghostly figures.

Miss Fleming achieved that in several of the songs she offered.

Wolford made $700,000 last year; Kelly makes $2.864 million a year.   Ralph Cindrich, Wolford's lawyer, negotiated a deal with the Colts over the weekend that included this clause tied to the team's record: He would be paid at least as much as the Colts' highest-paid offensive player.   Wolford then took that offer, which calls for Wolford to average $2.6 million a year over three years, and showed it to the Bills, who had seven days to match it. But the Bills' highest-paid player on offense happens to be Kelly, the quarterback hauling down an average of $2.9 million a year. Did this mean the Bills would, in order to match the Colts' deal, have to pay an offensive lineman as much as their star quarterback?   The league yesterday said no. Cindrich said yes.   The league's management council and the Players Association will fight it out before an arbitrator at a hearing tomorrow.   \"If this is disallowed, it's discrimination against offensive linemen,\" Cindrich said.   But that wasn't the only flurry of N.F.L. activity yesterday. In addition, the Cleveland Browns reunited those former University of Miami quarterback rivals, Bernie Kosar and Vinny Testaverde, by signing Testavarde as a backup for what the Browns described as a one-year deal plus an option year.   The 29-year-old Testaverde had wanted a $2 million-a-year deal. He is believed to have signed with the Browns for a base salary of about $1.4 million this year. The contract is heavily laced with options that could swell to more than $2 million.    Art Modell, the Browns' owner, said the team doesn't expect to move on Carl Banks, a linebacker who two years ago asked the Browns to make a deal for him with the Giants. Banks still expects to leave the Giants, and Alan Herman, his agent, said he expects at least one club to make an offer early next week. Since Banks is a transition player, the Giants would be entitled to match that offer and retain him. Coach Dan Reeves says the Giants will compete with any offer he receives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"For Yanks and Mets, a Day to Wince at Pitching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/sports/baseball-for-yanks-and-mets-a-day-to-wince-at-pitching.html","abstract":"  One day after the Yankees finally settled on their starting rotation, it was cast into potential doubt today when Melido Perez injured his left leg running to first base against the Atlanta Braves.

It established a base in Asyut, where the blind cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman -- the group's spiritual mentor -- taught theology.    By the mid-1970s the Islamic Group turned against the Brotherhood, which says it does not condone violence, maintaining that the Brotherhood had become corrupted by involvement in the political system. The Islamic Group then joined forces with the militant organization Holy War, which preached the violent overthrow of the state. When Holy War followers assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981 the Islamic Group simultaneously launched an uprising in Asyut. The insurrection was crushed after two days of fighting that left 44 policemen dead.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/nyregion/news-summary-676393.html","abstract":"  International A3-13  AID TO RUSSIA: HOW MUCH?  Almost since Boris N. Yeltsin climbed atop a tank in 1991 and hastened the end of the Soviet Union, Western nations have been talking about sending money to help him create a democratic Russia. But in dollars and cents, the aid actually offered has never been as big as the talk. And the amount actually delivered has been even smaller.  A1  YELTSIN READY FOR SUMMIT TALKS  President Yeltsin will be attending his weekend summit talks with President Clinton in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a stronger position after his showdown with the Congress of People's Deputies, the Russian Foreign Minister said, adding that \"the situation is firmly under control.\" A11  HARSH EGYPTIAN CRACKDOWN  Frustrated by its inability to stop a rising tide of violence by Islamic militants, the Egyptian Government has unleashed its security forces in a blood-letting and wave of detentions not seen in Egypt since the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981.  A1  PEACE AND TERROR IN ISRAEL  News analysis: Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has repeatedly said since he took office last July that talking peace with the Arabs is one thing and fighting Arabs who shoot and stab Israelis is something else entirely. A month of violence, however, has brought the two issues into a closer relationship.  A3  U.S. SEEKS AID ON ABORTIONS  Reversing nearly a decade of official Government antipathy toward some international family-planning programs, the Clinton Administration has decided to ask Congress to renew support for two groups that have raised the ire of those opposed to abortion. The United Nations and the International Planned Parenthood Federation are involved.  A1  CHINA RAISES HONG KONG STAKES  China raised the stakes in its war of nerves over Hong Kong by having its National People's Congress approve the formation of a special advisory committee to prepare for the return of the British territory, a step taken three years early.  A7  U.S. shifting its policy on Asian security.  A8  U.N. BACKS NATO ACTION IN BOSNIA  The United Nations Security Council stepped up its campaign to force Bosnia's isolated Serbs to end the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina by authorizing NATO to shoot down any planes violating its ban on flying over Bosnia.

A1  THE TIES THAT BIND THE TROOPS  With unusual calm, experts and Senators debated whether allowing homosexuals in the military would damage the intangible essence that binds a fighting force.

In February, the Recording Industry Association of America announced that on April 1, 1993, its members, the major recording companies, would distribute their compact disks in a 5-by-5 1/2-inch package, the size of the so-called jewel box inside a long box. Most CD's will continue to be sold in the clear plastic jewel boxes, but for truly environmentally sensitive performers, cardboard and other materials will be permitted.

But in every other way they're as dissimilar as two films can be and still share the same host medium. They form the engagingly offbeat program that will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P.M. and on Saturday at 9 P.M. as part of the New Directors/New Films series.   The French-made, 47-minute \"Night in Versailles\" was directed by Bruno Podalydes and written by him and his brother Denis, who also plays the hilariously hapless central character. The film is a boisterous farce in the spirit of Feydeau, updated to the 1990's and scaled down to the dimensions of an especially small two-room flat.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/style/chronicle-457093.html","abstract":"  BILL WYMAN, 56, the former Rolling Stones bass player, is 34 years older than his most recent wife, MANDY SMITH, now 22, whom he met when she was 13 and from whom he was divorced last year.

In a season when overt political content has the art world, most notably the Whitney Biennial, by the tail, Richard Serra is exhibiting one of the greatest works of abstract sculpture that New York City has seen in some time. It's hard to say whether \"Intersection II,\" a deceptively simple arrangement of four monumental curves of hot-rolled steel, is political or not. The piece certainly doesn't tackle any specific social problems. But looking at these soaring planes as they curve from the front to the back of the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo can make a viewer feel empowered and ready for just about anything life might bring.   In some ways this effect seems almost old-fashioned, as if Mr. Serra has created a contemporary version of a Greek temple or a Gothic cathedral. Indeed, as installed in this high-ceilinged former garage, sometimes known as Gogo SoHo, the piece has the rightness and the charged atmosphere of a permanent monument, even though it will be dismantled in two weeks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930402","headline":"Diner's Journal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/arts/diner-s-journal.html","abstract":"  Contemporary American    On a lonely, shadowy stretch of Lafayette Street in SoHo, two-month-old Cascabel is the kind of restaurant that needs exuberant word-of-mouth propulsion to get off the ground.

(201) 798-4064. Back in the mid-80's, alternative rock was a marginal enterprise with little room for artistes like Scott Miller of Game Theory, a hyperintellectual singer and songwriter who liked to tinker with pop the way a born mathematician tinkers with numbers. Of the few who heard his 1987 double-album opus \"Lolita Nation,\" fewer still understood it. These days, geekiness is a bit more fashionable, and Mr. Miller has returned with a new band, the Loud Family, that similarly indulges his love of the mechanics of sound. On the new album \"Plants and Birds and Rocks and Things\" (Alias), he layers psychedelic effects and speech fragments over a shimmery-sweet pop sensibility, in the tradition of Brian Wilson and Alex Chilton. Songs like \"Inverness\" definitely hit above the belt, but they're beautiful head trips nonetheless. With Wake Ooloo, a new band that includes members of the Feelies, tomorrow at 10 P.M.

One can hear the Passover story, for example, in Handel's remarkable but too rarely heard oratorio \"Israel in Egypt.\" And churches all over New York City are presenting many of the works that tell the story of Easter, including Bach's \"St. Matthew Passion,\" Stainer's \"Crucifixion\" and settings of the Seven Last Words of Christ, by Schutz, Haydn and Dubois. Of equal interest, though, are the works that look beyond Easter. Among this week's offerings, one can hear virtually the entire history of Mass settings, ranging from anonymous medieval English works to Masses by Josquin, Byrd, Haydn, Salieri, Gounod and Durufle, along with the Misa Flamenca by Paco Pena.
