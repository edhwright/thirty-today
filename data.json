Its title calls it a \"reform,\" but it would lock in court rulings that have watered down the laws under which state court prisoners get their cases reviewed by Federal courts. This section of the bill has to do with the body of law built around the concept of habeas corpus -- literally \"you (might) have the body.\"   When a prisoner secures a writ of habeas corpus from a Federal court, the state authorities must show that the prisoner received a fair trial and that they are therefore authorized to \"have the body\" in prison. This body of law has ancient roots. It was intended to curb the power of monarchs to keep citizens under arrest and in custody. Yet Mr. Biden sees no necessity for debate over the habeas corpus section of the crime bill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Enviable Record of Small-Firm Funds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/02/your-money/IHT-enviable-record-of-smallfirm-funds.html","abstract":"ALEX Dundas believes in putting his money where his mouth is.

The teams' records are in parentheses. P.S.A.L.  Sheepshead Bay (2-0) at Lafayette (1-2) Key Players: Both teams feature a ball-control offense and rely on hard-hitting defensive units. \"Brooklyn football is like the Midwest,\" said Sheepshead Bay Coach Dick Reilly. \"It's bang-bang football.\" Lafayette's linemen may have trouble moving defensive end Elvis Abellard (19 tackles) and Company off the ball, as the Frenchies are significantly smaller than the Skippers up front. Lafayette will probably have to throw the ball to create running lanes. Sheepshead Bay features a more balanced attack, as Michael Reilly, the coach's son, is a smart quarterback with an accurate arm to complement the fine running combination of Kwesi Daniels and Joe Coffey. Daniels received Sheepshead Bay's game ball last week after rushing for 145 yards on 18 carries and 1 touchdown in the 15-14 victory over Curtis. Daniels also registered 15 tackles and 2 sacks as a linebacker.  Comment: Lafayette has won the last two meetings against Sheepshead Bay in the closing seconds. Lafayette defeated the Skippers, 13-6, last year and by 19-17 in 1991. \"Those are the ones that put the white back into your beard,\" said Reilly, Sheepshead Bay's coach.  Lehman (1-1) at South Shore (0-2) Key Players: What South Shore quarterback Adrian Nazario lacks in size (5 foot 5 inches, and 150 pounds), he makes up in heart. \"He's a tough kid,\" said Coach Stan Feldman. \"He gets knocked down and he pops right back up. He's our leader.\" Nonetheless, the Vikings' offense still depends on the running of Tracey McDonald, Carlos Cromwell and Dwayne Bennett. Lehman needs Robert Talley to rebound from last week's 30-7 loss to Canarsie, in which he was limited to 27 yards rushing on 10 carries.  Comment: South Shore has yet to score a point this season, losing by 26-0 in its opener against Curtis and by 20-0 to Lincoln. \"I'm really proud of the boys,\" said Feldman. \"They haven't given up, and they've been gung-ho in practice.\"  C.H.S.F.L.  Spellman (2-1) at St. John the Baptist (3-0) Key Players: St. John the Baptist's offense is ranked No. 1 in the A Division, averaging 271.3 yards a game. Eric Martin (31 of 55 for 533 yards, 5 touchdowns, 1 interception), who is the division's leading passer, has three sure-handed targets in tight end Robert Kelly (11 receptions for 219 yards, 2 touchdowns), wide receiver Dennis McGuire (6 for 100 yards, 1 touchdown) and running back Mike Grippo (11 for 163 yards, 2 touchdowns). Martin's counterpart, David Rodriguez, is a pretty good signal caller himself, passing for 2 touchdowns and rushing for 2 others. Rodriguez's favorite receiver is Michael Baptiste (4 catches for 71 yards, 1 touchdown). Comment: Jay Byrne Gamble, the St. John the Baptist coach, is back after a 10-year hiatus. He has returned to the school where he had three consecutive Metro Bowl titles after serving part of the time as an assistant coach at Hofstra University. His presence, along with a new staff of assistants, has helped turn around a program that had a 12-35-1 record over the past three years.  St. Anthony (3-0) vs. Nazareth (2-0)  at Canarsie Key Players: St. Anthony has averaged a league-best 369 yards on the ground a game, while the Kingsmen defense has allowed a league-low of 89 yards rushing. The Friars' offense, which averages over 30 points a game, revolves around the backfield of Tony Williams (38 carries for 615 yards, 6 touchdowns), who is the league's leading gainer, and Dan Shea (22 carries for 268 yards, 6 touchdowns). Nazareth boasts a good inside (Julien Dale) and outside (Gordon Tunison) running attack. Dale, a 6-foot, 220-pound fullback, has carried 28 times for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns. Tinson is a 5-5, 140-pound tailback who has rushed 17 times for 218 yards and 3 touchdowns.  Comment: St. Anthony's backfield is quick and has been aided by playing all of its games on Astroturf, an advantage that St. Anthony's runners will enjoy once again this afternoon. Long Island  Longwood (1-0) at Brentwood (0-1) Key Players: Longwood's backfield of Jason Schuster (4.6 for 40 yards), John Lange (4.7 speed) and quarterback Eric Brown (4.5 speed) is lightning quick. The threesome combined last week for over 400 yards rushing in a 35-7 victory over Ward Melville. Felipe Sabino will do most of Brentwood's running behind Carl Matzen (6-2, 286-pound tackle) and John Alvarado (6-2, 250-pound guard), both of whom anchor the right side. Comment: Longwood is ranked No. 2 in Suffolk County and 21st in New York State by the Sports Writers Association. Last year, Longwood lost to Connetquot, 28-7, in the county's final. \"I think that experience is going to help us,\" said Schuster. \"We experienced what it's like, and hopefully we're going to learn from it.\" New Jersey  Elizabeth (1-0) at Linden (1-0) Key Players: Elizabeth is once again loaded with Division 1 talent: tailback Kaream Bowser, Sharod Williams (wr-db), Hector Sepuleeda (dt-og) and linebacker Frank Chmiel are all being heavily recruited by colleges. This talented bunch is directed by sophomore Al Hawkins, who is a \"scary quarterback who could throw the long ball off his heels,\" said Linden Coach James McDonald. Linden's two blue-chip prospects are two-way ends Mike Pringley (6-4, 218) and Dave Biles (6-4, 275).  Comment: Last year, Elizabeth had eight Division 1 players but only managed a 5-4 record. \"We had a bunch of superstars that were only interested in themselves,\" said Coach Jerry Moore. He added that this year's team works better together. \"I like the chemistry of this group. They work hard and are very aggressive. And when we hit you, you stay hit. They are playing Elizabeth's style of football.\"  Fieldston (1-1) at Dwight-Englewood (0-2) Key Players: \"To let Gus Ornstein set up is to set yourself up to get beat,\" Englewood Coach Dave Hansburg said of Fieldston's quarterback. Ornstein (16 of 35 for 219, 1 touchdown, 1 interception), who is being recruited by Michigan, Notre Dame and Miami as a quarterback and first baseman, has the ability to pick apart opposing defenses if given the time. Sam Gilbert (4 catches, 122 yards, 1 td) is Fieldston's deep threat. Fieldston will have to contain the Bulldogs backfield of Josh Walsky, Rick Komotar and Steve Milo. Comment: The outcome will be determined on the line of scrimmage, where Fieldston's over-matched line will be called upon to hold back the rush of tackles Luis Locuroto and Matt Seiff.  Connecticut  Bassick (1-1) at Darien (1-1) Key Players: Johnny Barnes (23 carries for 154 yards, 3 touchdowns) is the best of Bassick's speedy backs capable of springing at any time. James Hanford (172 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns) and Vince Childress (181 yards, 2 touchdowns) share the running duties for Darien. Jeff Eaton's (13 for 32 for 221 yards, 2 touchdowns) ability to complete the short passes gives the Blue Wave's offense a more diversified attack than Bassick's. Chris Robbins (9 catches for 193 yards, 1 touchdown) is Eaton's primary target.  Comment: Darien Coach Mike Sangster says he plans to drop a few plays from the teams' playbook after losing by 21-20 to Greenwich last week, snapping the teams' 16-game unbeaten string. \"I just think that we made too many mistakes last week and that we need to go back to the basics,\" he said. Westchester and Rockland  North Rockland (3-0) at Roosevelt (3-0) Key Players: While both teams are comparable in size, North Rockland's linemen hold the advantage over the Indians' less experienced big men. Tom Morreira (tackle, 6-2, 270), Conrad Bartosik (guard, 6-0, 200), Ed Teitz (center, 6-2, 260), Tom Johnson (guard, 6-0, 200) and Rajah Winn (tackle, 5-9, 260) will need to gain maturity in a hurry and find a way to open holes for Roosevelt's star runner, Franklin McBride. He has rushed for 4 scores and over 100 yards in each of the teams' games. McBride's counterpart is Marcus Larkins, a 5-8, 170-pound runner who has rushed for 344 yards and 5 touchdowns. Raiders quarterback Jeff Becker (12 of 25 for 281 yards, 5 touchdowns) is a quality drop-back passer who sees the whole field and delivers the ball with accuracy. Comment: \"This could be the biggest game ever played in Westchester and Rockland County,\" said Roosevelt Coach Tony Dematteo. The teams have never met during the regular season. The game will be carried live on Channel 3 on TCI Cable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Rose Bowl? Northwestern?

The subject is incest, but the story's potential for tawdriness is never exploited. Instead, Ms. Issermann presents a discreet, methodical account of how 12-year-old Alexandrine (Sandrine Blancke) comes to bring and then recant charges against her father, Jean (Alain Bashung).   If the director's approach is at all representative, then the cultural differences between French and American approaches to this subject are fascinating. The American impulse toward tabloid sensationalism is nowhere evident; nor is the urge to air all the family's dirty laundry in the interests of catharsis. If anything, the LeBlancs feel profoundly embarrassed by their problem and wish it would simply go away. In a climate of sexual sophistication and naturalness, the charge of incest is perhaps even more devastating than it would be in dysfunction-conscious America.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/02/nyregion/c-corrections-861593.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Company News column of Business Day yesterday, about the acquisition of the Dexter Shoe Company by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., misstated the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock.

problem, the company says in its billing enclosures and cable advertisements, is a Federal law that allows networks to demand payments for allowing cable operators to carry their signals. It was not fair, Cablevision said, for the networks to demand money for what was free to anyone with an antenna. The networks argued that they should be paid, just as cable companies pay to carry premium channels like Showtime and HBO.\n\nOn Long Island the availability of stations like WCBS-TV, WNBC-TV and WABC-TV was on the line. Now it appears that little will change. In the battle between the networks and the $20 billion cable industry, an industry in which Cablevision is a major player, cable appears to have won.

Is it my imagination or is the city constantly ripping up, refilling and then reripping up the Avenue of the Americas? This has been going on for a while, and the effect on traffic is disastrous.  A.  Road construction is done in phases, so digging and redigging is necessary. In the first stage of major overhauls like the present job on Avenue of the Americas between West 32d and 59th Streets, the contractor rips up the street to get at the sewer lines, 10 to 30 feet below the street. After the lines are replaced, temporary asphalt is laid down so traffic can proceed -- that is, until the street is ripped up again to accommodate work on the water main, 5 to 10 feet below the street's surface.   \"This gives the appearance that they did something wrong and have to go back to fix it,\" said Lisa Doglian, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. \"But really this is the best way. Otherwise we would have to close down an entire route for two years, or a few blocks for several months.\"   The project will stop for a while around Thanksgiving, to avoid holiday traffic tie-ups, and should be near completion by next summer. A Tree Grows   Q.  How do you go about getting trees for your block?  A.  It's not as hard as you might imagine. Find the address of your community board in the telephone book. Then simply file a request with the board, which will work with the street tree coordinator in the Parks Department to put a tree on your block. Equal Haircuts   Q.  Why do New York salons charge more for women's haircuts than men's? Why would an otherwise liberal city tolerate sexist scissors? Is it even legal? A.  Absolutely not, according to Linda Sachs, the assistant commissioner for the City Department of Consumer Affairs. \"If salons are engaged in setting prices based on gender, it is a violation of the New York City Human Rights law,\" she said. The commission has sued various hair salons violating the law, and the salons were forced to equalize their pricing.    The logic behind the difference varies. Some stylists say that women generally have longer hair; others that men don't get their hair blown dry -- a notion often belied by contemporary hair fashions.    Many salon workers say they don't know how their pricing policy came about. \"It's just always been the rate,\" said an employee at the West Eighth Street branch of International Haircutters, a citywide chain that charges $13 and up for men, $18 and up for women. Another salon, Rubann on East 57th Street, charges men $45 and women $50.    If you are charged more for a cut than a man, you can report the salon to the Human Rights Commission at (212) 306-7500.

Last year, the Democratic Party saw three of its most seasoned, well-known politicians, Robert Abrams, Geraldine A.

The Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, was believed to be vulnerable. Party leaders could taste victory.    Then the ugly realities of New York politics turned up like the cancerous underbelly of a dead fish. The campaigning turned muddy and the candidates turned on each other.

Last year our reviewer, Leonard Michaels, said that in relating a tortured man's physical and spiritual wanderings, this Colombian author has produced \"a fascinating and original work.\"  YOUNG MEN & FIRE By Norman Maclean. University of Chicago, $9.95. Winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award and named one of the nine best books of 1992 by The New York Times Book Review, this account examines the 1949 Mann Gulch fire in Montana, a disaster that killed 13 young Forest Service smoke jumpers trapped between the flames and a mountain ridge. The author seeks not only to arrive at the truth of their tragedy, but also to confront his own mortality and the arbitrary nature of the accidents that often govern our fates. \"This great book takes us to that ancient reef blocking us from the summit and then whirls and looks straight into the heart of the fire,\" James R.

The critic H. C. Robbins Landon reconstructed some scores that had been thought to be lost; several were successfully staged at the Holland Festival, including a memorable \"Fedelta Premiata\" directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, and Antal Dorati recorded eight of the operas for Philips to great acclaim (now reissued, 432 413/38; 20 CD's). And that, it seems, was the end of the great Haydn opera revival.   It is astonishing that none of these operas has found its way into the fringes of the repertory, for they contain some of the loveliest vocal writing of the 18th century, and the orchestrations are continually fresh and inventive. Haydn, who is now best known as a composer of vocal music for his Masses and the great, late oratorios, had a high regard for the operas he composed as Kapellmeister at Eszterhaza castle. In a 1781 letter to his publisher, Haydn said of \"La Fedelta Premiata\": \"I assure you that no such work has been heard in Paris up to now, nor perhaps in Vienna either.

A photographer asks them to pose for a picture: Joe Masteroff, librettist; Sheldon Harnick, lyricist, and Jerry Bock, composer. Suddenly, the three of them burst into song. Arms around one another, they sing \"Vanilla Ice Cream\" from the show, boyishly, exuberantly, proudly. It is, in and of itself, a musical theater moment.   On Thursday \"She Loves Me\" will have its second opening in less than a year. This time, it will be at the Brooks Atkinson on Broadway, where it is now in previews. The Roundabout Theater Company production has transferred almost intact. The love story is still bittersweet: it is the 1930's, and two clerks in a Budapest parfumerie who disliked each other on sight discover that they have been romantic pen pals all along. Boyd Gaines is George and Diane Fratantoni, replacing Judy Kuhn, is Amalia, with Louis Zorich as Maraczek, the store's owner.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"SOAPBOX;\nGiving Students a Chance to Risk Failure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/soapbox-giving-students-a-chance-to-risk-failure.html","abstract":"IN 1987, after 29 years spent teaching and supervising in elementary and junior high schools, I became a superintendent of high schools in Brooklyn and started visiting classrooms.

Sometimes it means the kind of writing that breaks conventions -- by making a villain of a hero, as Agatha Christie did so subtly, or, like Thomas Harris, by taking readers so deep into a killer's mind that we share the madness. But originality can also mean working the same old conventions in the same old ways while allowing the characters unconventional responses, which is what James Preston Girard does in his mesmerizing novel, THE LATE MAN (Atheneum, $20).   Surely we've read this plot before: a reporter and a police detective are both obsessed with a series of unsolved murders. Capt. L. J. Loomis of the Wichita Police Department attributes the crackup of his marriage to his failure to find the person who strangled five women, leaving broken flowers by their corpses. Sam Haun, a newspaperman who has been traumatized by the accidental death of his unfaithful wife, is haunted by the killings in a way he can't explain. \"I'm not personally involved with wanting to catch him,\" Haun tells Loomis after the strangler strikes again. \"I'm just trying to understand.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"BACKTALK;\nA Seven-Point Plan to Help Get Boxing Off the Canvas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/sports/backtalk-a-sevenpoint-plan-to-help-get-boxing-off-the-canvas.html","abstract":"\"I count him as a great man,\" Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"who inhabits a higher space of thought, into which other men rise with labor and difficulty; he has but to open his eyes to see things in a true light, and in large relation; whilst they must make painful corrections, and keep a vigilant eye on many sources of error.\"\n\nI don't know if Emerson was a follower of the fistic arts, but his remarks ring a distinct bell in this corner.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"A Weekend of Excursions on Foot","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/a-weekend-of-excursions-on-foot.html","abstract":"NO less than 50 guided walks for every age, fitness level and field of interest will be offered next weekend throughout the northeast region of the state, which calls itself the quiet corner.

The speak-easy was called Mario's; later, it was where Lionel Trilling and I had much of our courtship. There were more elegant speak-easies in New York than Mario's, converted East Side mansions with handsome iron gates and the imposing air of art galleries that deal only in Old Masters, but they were expensive and intimidating. Mario's occupied the two lower floors of a rundown brownstone in the West 40's; it could once have been a theatrical boardinghouse and was now a speak-easy only in the sense that it sold illegal liquor and that its owner went through the required ritual of inspecting his customers through a peephole in the locked front door. In all other respects it was a family-style trattoria, serving excellent home-cooked food at low prices. Most important, it was safe to drink its liquor. Every day during the Prohibition years the newspapers published their grim toll of people blinded or killed by wood alcohol. We were no more deterred by their warnings than a later generation would be deterred from the use of drugs by warnings in the press.    There was no problem in gaining access to a speak-easy in Prohibition; anyone could turn up a \"friend\" whose name would open some thickly bolted door. The innocent, as opposed to the sinister, speak-easy scene is wonderfully portrayed in that rarest of American literary achievements, a good comic novel: Elmer Davis's \"Friends of Mr. Sweeney.\" Not the police but death or blindness was what people like ourselves had to fear from Prohibition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"One Prodigy Itches to Become an Adult","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/arts/one-prodigy-itches-to-become-an-adult.html","abstract":"  Leila Josefowicz's Period of grace as a precocious novelty is almost at an end.

Throughout most of the year, sportsmen from all over Britain line their banks engaged in that keenest of Scottish traditions, fishing for salmon on a colorful, hand-tied fly. This is not the timid, intellectual angling of North American trout streams but the hearty, two-fisted manhandling of a 16-foot salmon rod along the craggy outcroppings and raging currents of Europe's finest spate rivers -- those that rise and fall rapidly depending upon local rainfall.   It is also not an enterprise for the faint of heart -- or wallet. The rights to fish salmon in Scottish rivers are often owned separately from the surrounding land, and many rivers are virtually inaccessible because their salmon stocks are held by private individuals or syndicates who reserve fishing rights.  Those wishing to wet a line must book through a hotel with its own fishing rights or rent a private lodge through estate managers who specialize in fishing leases. A week's fishing on one of the better salmon rivers can cost up to $1,500 a rod. (A rod means one person fishing a full day; two or three anglers often divide a rod, alternating with each other in the course of the day, and split the cost.) It's no surprise, then, that few anglers ever release a catch. The salmon are earmarked for the table.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Deaths of Basque Suspects Stir Public Sympathy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/world/deaths-of-basque-suspects-stir-public-sympathy.html","abstract":"  The deaths of two Basque guerrilla suspects in police custody last weekend has stirred sympathy for Basque separatism just as public support for the E.T.A. separatist group appeared to be dwindling.

There is too much discrimination here.\"   Francel Aguirre, a slightly built 27-year-old Ecuadorean, spoke quietly about his life as a member of the village of Ossining's largest group of new immigrants. He was surrounded by the friendly faces of fellow members of his English-as-a-second-language class, in the Ossining School District Office on Croton Avenue.    The village of Ossining has one of the largest concentrations of Ecuadoreans in the county; there are also growing populations in Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill.   The teachers of English as a second language had organized a lunchtime party to celebrate their students' progress and allow them to share native foods. The 20 people included a man from Mexico City, a woman from Korea, a woman from Japan and a man from Bangladesh.    Mr. Aguirre said: \"The different races cannot live together here. They must always stay apart. Ecuadoreans are victims of so many things, and we can say nothing. We don't do anything bad. We just work hard, and they give us a hard time.\" Census Figures Analyzed    Outside the shelter of such institutions as the English-as-a-second-language classroom, Mr. Aguirre and his fellow Ecuadoreans say they are often victims of crime and discrimination.    According to 1990 census figures, the white population in the village of Ossining grew at a rate of 2 percent between 1980 and 1990. The population of nonwhites, as the census report puts it, grew by 44 percent, and the Hispanic population (which can be of any race) increased by 113 percent. By 1990, there were 3,692 Hispanic people in the village, whose population at that time was 22,582. Many village residents estimate that there are at least several thousand Ecuadoreans living and working in Ossining, legally or illegally, making them the largest group of recent immigrants in the village. Of the village's 22,000 or so residents, 4,350 in 1990 were foreign born.   Ossining Union Free School District statistics show that, as of last March, Ecuadorean children represented the largest immigrant group, with 35 newly arrived students in a school population of 3,281. The next largest groups were from Jamaica, Colombia, Peru, Portugal and Haiti.  Students who have lived in this country for longer than three years are not counted in the yearly school district new-immigrant census, so the actual number of immigrant students is much higher.   Officials at St. Ann's School, one of two Roman Catholic schools in Ossining, also say that their largest group of new immigrants is from Ecuador, with 11 children out of a total of 285 in the last school year.    But many Ecuadorean men come to Ossining without their families, work at transitory jobs in landscaping and construction and are uncounted. As large as the Ecuadorean population seems, it is hard to gauge without census designations more specific than \"Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic\" and without children to be counted in the school census. There were 2,312 \"other Hispanic\" residents in the village, according to the census.   Like many of them, Mr. Aguirre left his parents, two brothers and a sister at home in Ecuador and has lived with his uncle and brother in an apartment near the Sing Sing Correctional Facility for five years. A baker who works nights, he said he had been denied a green card (the common name for the alien registration card), but he said he would try again.   The card is obtained when either a close family member is a legal resident or an employer files a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking that the person be granted lawful permanent resident status. Some applications are processed quickly. Some are more complicated. Many illegal immigrants fall prey to fraudulent schemes promising a green card.    Mr. Aquirre said he was attacked while walking along Spring Street in the village. His attackers yelled, \"Speak English!\" before roughing him up, he said. He added that banks will not open accounts without Social Security numbers and that Ecuadoreans are frequently beaten and robbed for their savings, which they carry with them.    Anibal Gonzalez Jr., who is of Puerto Rican descent, is one of two Hispanic police officers in the village of Ossining who have tried to explain American life to the newest Spanish-speaking immigrants. He said, \"If they're going to get into trouble, it's because they're drinking and then driving, or sometimes they wander into certain areas and guys will hassle them.\"   Mr. Gonzalez added: \"We see them with their pockets torn and their faces bloody, or the victims of a car crash, and they refuse medical care. They think the hospitals won't treat their emergency needs.    \"Or they refuse to report a crime to us. They're afraid of being found out if they're here illegally and being deported. We try to straighten them out and tell them that they have to trust the system a little more.\"    Reacting to the Ecuadoreans' fear of authority, Dr. Emil Nigro, director of emergency medicine at the Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in neighboring North Tarrytown, said, \"We never, never turn anyone away.\" He said that not only does his emergency room evaluate everyone who comes to them and treat them if needed but that it also does not require identification or insurance. Only a few simple questions are asked at admission and, Dr. Nigro added, \"All records are confidential.\" He added that in most cases hospitals must absorb the cost of emergency room visits by illegal aliens.   Diego Santiago, a Colombian-born police officer who lives in Ossining, has visited St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church on Eastern Avenue to tell Hispanic men how to protect themselves. St. Ann's is known as the immigrants' church in the community.   \"Walk in groups, never alone,\" Officer Santiago said. \"Don't drink to drunkenness. Don't carry large amounts of cash. Don't be afraid of the police.\" The Rev. Frank Oliverio has told these groups that they may feel free to keep their strongboxes with their savings in his rectory, just across the street from St. Ann's. About 350 Hispanic families attend the Spanish Masses at St. Ann's, but the church also offers special Masses in Italian, Portuguese and Korean. St. Ann's also serves many second- and third-generation Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans.    Father Oliverio said he hopes to form a support group for Ecuadoreans and other Hispanic men in this country without their families.    Not all Hispanic men are disillusioned. Luis Pani, a 31-year-old laborer, said he has never been assaulted. \"Maybe that's why I'm so happy here,\" he said. Although he has been unsuccessful in obtaining a green card, Mr. Pani, a bachelor, has formed a network of friends and made a life for himself in Ossining.  He has become active in St. Ann's Church and has become a familiar and popular figure in his English-as-a-second-language classes.    \"America is a country of green fields, blue-eyed blond girls, wonderful summers and houses with green gardens and lawnmowers,\" he said. \"That is my dream, to have a house in the suburbs, a wife, a couple of kids and a lawnmower that can blow the leaves in the fall.\"   Marcia Siguenza, an Ecuadorean who recently moved to North Tarrytown after nine years in Ossining, worries about the social havoc caused by the mostly male migration from Ecuador. \"It is sad, very sad,\" she said. \"The men are coming to this country without their wives. Sometimes they remarry here, but it is not really a marriage. They do this because it helps them get a green card.    \"It is breaking up the families in Ecuador. In some places in southern Ecuador, there are no men, only women. And there are bad men who are selling visas for too much, $4,000, which takes many years to pay off with interest.\"    Ms. Siguenza, who has an Alien Registration Card, the so-called green card, is the supervisor of housekeeping at Kings College in Briarcliff. Her four grown children have done well in life, she said. But she said she failed to understand why so many young Ecuadorean men chose this country over their own. \"They have a nice, simple life in Ecuador,\" she said. \"Maybe not with TV or cars. But there's too much here. It's a big transformation for them, and they're not really ready for it. They come mostly from the farms, from the countryside.\"   Jose and Zoila Illescas have four children they left in Ecuador in the care of grandparents. The Illescases are both working, he in construction and she as a housecleaner. They have green cards and eagerly await the day they can afford to bring their children to the United States.  An Unofficial Protector    Carlos Castro, a constable and court officer, is a second-generation Colombian-American who has lived in Ossining for 25 years. He is an unofficial protector and adviser to the newest Hispanic immigrants who end up in the village courtroom. He said he is appalled by their living conditions. \"Many homes have them stacked up inside,\" Mr. Castro said.  \"But you wouldn't know it from the street.\"   Frank Vardy, an immigration authority from the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the Ecuadoreans are similar to the immigrant groups who preceded them. Those Ecuadoreans who choose to return to their native country are \"much like the Italian 'birds of passage' from the late 1800's and early 1900's,\" he said.   \"Those men came and lived cheaply and sent money home to the wife and children,\" Mr. Vardy said. \"Then, after 5 or 10 years, they went home with a bankroll and bought a farm or opened up a business.\"    Despite his steady job as a baker, Mr. Aguirre said he has been disillusioned and feels estranged. He added that he must continue working hard, living simply and watching his back if he is ever to be able to return home with anything to show for his time here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"3 Deer Park Brothers Make Mark in Hollywood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/3-deer-park-brothers-make-mark-in-hollywood.html","abstract":"THINKING more about the Warner brothers than Horace Greeley, more than a decade ago three young men from Long Island went west to seek fame and fortune in the film industry.\n\nHollywood has proven to be a formidable challenge.

After decades in which shoreline development was guided by the same rules that cover the densest urban neighborhoods, the City Planning Commission has crafted zoning measures that are meant to open the land's edge.   Public space, including shoreline walkways with landscaped borders, would be required in certain large projects. Building heights and widths would be limited, as would floor sizes. Development rights could no longer be transferred upland from underwater property. And suburban-style \"big box\" discount stores would be prohibited on piers.   \"This is an unprecedented zoning text amendment that will, for the first time, put the waterfront into the Zoning Resolution,\" declared Richard L. Schaffer, the commission chairman, just before his colleagues voted in August to amend the resolution with 200 pages of new text.   What kind of precedent does the amendment offer? Real estate interests maintain that the zoning would thoroughly dampen development by imposing too many extra costs on private builders. Meanwhile, neighborhood leaders and environmental advocates say the zoning does not go far enough to preserve openness.   But the true test will not come until it is known exactly where along the 578-mile waterfront these new rules are to be applied -- and, of course, until the real-estate market recovers.   \"The issue is, as we begin to come back in this town economically, does this inhibit the development of new sites on the waterfront?\" asked Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, Democrat of Queens, who heads the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee.   Tomorrow, the subcommittee is to hold its second hearing on the subject. The zoning amendment would be considered next by the Land Use Committee and then, later this month, by the full Council.   Legal challenges are almost sure to follow. Questions have already been raised about the constitutionality of the public access and underwater zoning rules, as they might be construed as an unlawful taking of property.   Critics have also faulted the overall process, saying that the effects of the zoning measures cannot be adequately evaluated before planners pinpoint the sites.   \"WE'RE horrified that no environmental impact statement was deemed necessary and believe it may be actionable,\" said William P. Bowser of the West Village Committee, speaking to the zoning subcommittee. Several community boards have also called for a full environmental assessment.   However, the counsel to the City Planning Department, William Valletta, told the subcommittee that the new zoning tools \"have not landed anywhere\" yet.   \"To say 'these are the places and these are the impacts' is just not possible,\" he said.   In the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan of 1992, city planners generally identified some 20 areas, now zoned for manufacturing, where they believe residential redevelopment would be appropriate. These include large parcels in Flushing and Long Island City, Queens, and the Red Hook and Mill Basin sections of Brooklyn.   About 5 percent of the manufacturing districts on the waterfront might be rezoned residentially, said Marilyn Mammano, the director of zoning and urban design for the City Planning Department. Other new rules -- those governing piers and platforms, for example -- would be in force citywide.   Under the new zoning, builders of large projects in medium- to high-density residential and commercial districts would have to set aside 15 to 20 percent of their property for the public, including shoreline esplanades 20 to 25 feet wide, with landscaped \"buffer\" areas between the public and private space.   Currently, there is no such requirement, although negotiations with developers of waterfront projects like Brighton by the Sea in Brooklyn have yielded even greater amounts of land set aside for the public.   To get people out to the esplanades through private property, connections would have to be run between the shoreline and public streets or parks at intervals no greater than 600 feet. These walkways would be 12 to 30 feet wide and would be counted toward the overall public space requirement.   A former counsel to the City Planning Department, Norman Marcus, has criticized this approach, in his role as chairman of the New York County Lawyers' Association urban development and land use committee.   \"There is a kind of dominant reliance on privately owned property as the vehicle for providing public access,\" he said. \"After 30 years of conflict and quarreling over plazas and the rights of owners versus the rights of the public, it seemed silly to be expanding this difficulty to such an important goal as public access to the waterfront.\"   Instead, the lawyers' group proposed that open space and connections be provided through public streets and public parks that were officially mapped as such and, therefore, were the city's responsibility.   Mr. McCaffrey also noted \"a legal issue in terms of takings.\" The Fifth Amendment prohibits taking private property for public use without just compensation.   But Mr. Valletta cited the common-law doctrine that lands between high and low tides -- known as \"wet sand\" -- were held by the state in trust for the public's use for fishing and navigation. That trust was not extinguished by private ownership, he said.   \"Since the public trust is still there,\" he said, \"can we say that the equivalent of the public's historic right to go down to 'wet sand' is, in modern terms, the requirement for public access along a walkway? Our zoning is built on the idea that that's an acceptable and appropriate modern substitute.\"   On land, building sizes would be regulated several ways by the new zoning. In medium- to high-density residential districts, there would be height limits ranging from 150 to 390 feet (roughly 15 to 40 stories). The upper floors could not be wider than 100 feet parallel to the shoreline and floor sizes would have a limit of 7,000 to 8,100 square feet.   The result would be smaller towers and more of them on the site. The Real Estate Board of New York complained that more towers mean more elevator cores, elevators, fire stairs and building entrances. That means higher construction costs, less floor space for apartments and more security problems.   THERE would also be fewer apartments with water views, which command premiums up to 20 percent in rental buildings and up to 50 percent in co-ops or condominiums, the Real Estate Board said.   \"Manhattan market values may make up for the inherent economic penalties,\" the board said. \"However, rezoned industrial areas in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island are not likely to command rents to offset these costs.\"   Mr. Schaffer said, \"We believe these are buildable buildings with a substantial amount of flexibility.\" Planners point to the broad, wall-like expanse of Shore Towers in Astoria, Queens, as an example of what they do not want to happen again.   Something else they do not want to see again is a proposal like Trump City on the Hudson River, which would have used development rights from under water to generate up to 4.5 million square feet of floor space, for a total of 15.33 million square feet. (The project was later scaled down to 8.3 million square feet and renamed Riverside South.)   Trump City would have taken advantage of the fact that property between the bulkhead and pierhead lines has been recognized as part of the zoning lot. Development rights from that property -- obviously unusable under water -- can be transferred to sites on land or piers, yielding much more building bulk than would ordinarily be permitted.   The new zoning would end the use of underwater property, beyond the bulkhead line, in the calculation of allowable density.   This, too, might be challenged as a taking. The Real Estate Board has said the new rule \"raises serious constitutional issues.\"   Mr. Valletta, however, said the granting of development rights from underwater property was not a matter of law but rather an interpretation of the Zoning Resolution by the Buildings Department -- \"a kind of bonus.\"   \"We gave a little extra and we can clearly take it away,\" he said, \"because the constitution protects property rights and this is not a property right.\"   On existing piers, building sizes would be strictly limited, unless a developer received a special permit. As a matter of right, structures less than 200 feet long could rise only 40 feet. Longer, shed-like buildings could rise only 30 feet. And public space would be required all along the pier.   Developers could seek a special permit to build much larger buildings on piers. \"But given that the as-of-right standard has been significantly reduced,\" Ms. Mammano said, \"you have something to measure it against.\" It would seem unlikely, for instance, that planners would approve a structure 10 times higher than the stated limit.   Also on piers, planners have imposed a limit of 20,000 square feet on certain kinds of stores, including \"warehouses that provide accessory retail sales areas.\"   \"YOU couldn't have a 100,000- or 200,000-square-foot Rickel's,\" Ms. Mammano told the subcommittee at its first hearing. \"Going to a Home Depot and loading up on two-by-four's is not a waterfront experience.\"   Mr. McCaffrey asked, \"How is that different from going to the South Street Seaport and shopping at Banana Republic?\"   \"There are no windows, there is no life on the street,\" Ms. Mammano replied. \"At the South Street Seaport, when you go to Banana Republic, you don't just shop there. You have a drink. You sit down. You meander.\"   New piers and platforms are limited to parks, playgrounds or what planners call \"water-dependent\" uses, including docks, boatels, boat yards, launches, heliports, seaplane bases, sewage-disposal plants and marine-transfer stations for garbage.   By special permit, new piers can be converted to \"waterfront-enhancing\" uses like hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, arenas, boat showrooms, skating rinks, tennis courts and golf courses -- provided that the original use had ended at least two years earlier.   While critics suspect that this is a loophole through which commercial development can be slipped on to new piers, Ms. Mammano said: \"Who is going to go out and get a Corps of Engineers permit, financing for a water-dependent use, open it, close it for two years, then come in for a special permit? And all you can get is a waterfront-enhancing use, which does not include residential or offices. We thought the downside risk was minimal.\"   However, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan told the subcommittee, through an aide, that she opposed any rules that would \"give city sanction to as-of-right development of new piers or platforms\" or \"offer a special permit for converting these uses to other more questionable uses.\"   The vice president of the New York City Audubon Society, Leslie T. Sharpe, urged the city to allow new piers only where there was no practicable alternative. \"Activities that are 'enhanced' by a water-based location, such as an ice-skating rink and a golf driving range are not a proper use of the waterfront,\" she told the subcommittee.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"COMMERCE LEADER FACES MAJOR TEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/us/commerce-leader-faces-major-test.html","abstract":"  Ronald H.

After watching young Willie lob several shots onto the green of the Chasm hole, a par three guarded by a deep pit, Vanderbilt turned to his friends and pronounced: \"Gentlemen, this beats rifle shooting for distance and accuracy. It is a game that I think would go in our country.\"   The encounter proved to be an epochal one in the history of American golf, for Vanderbilt and his friends soon founded the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, one of the first in this country, where Willie Dunn arrived in March 1891 to serve as pro and expand the course. But while the game caught hold in America, it never developed the same appeal in France, where it remained the preserve of an elite few.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"SOAPBOX;\nOnce, We Were Compassionate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/soapbox-once-we-were-compassionate.html","abstract":"IT was chance that brought me to the Upper West Side: one friend booted me out of his loft in SoHo and another let me use his family's empty two-room co-op near Columbia.

But it is especially so in the fall. With no cities within a three-hour drive -- New York City is a five-hour drive away -- the leaf-peeping crowds here are smaller than in the Catskills or the White Mountains, and solitude is abundant on the innumerable mountain trails, streams and glassy lakes.   The Adirondacks are, after all, the largest park in America outside Alaska: a six-million-acre region larger than Massachusettes and as wild as many national parks in the West. This is where Ralph Waldo Emerson, seeking haven from civilization, established his \"philosopher's camp\" on Follensby Pond. And this is where a host of 19th-century millionaires with names like Whitney, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller built sprawling villas -- also called camps, no matter what their size -- around distant lakes, giving aristocratic cachet to the notion that remoteness somehow augmented the natural beauty of a place.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/c-corrections-622793.html","abstract":"  The Design column in The Times Magazine last Sunday omitted a credit for the picture of Rudolf Nureyev.

I thought it was one of the smartest works he ever made -- if people could bring themselves to collect soup cans, why not gather dust? -- and I thought of it again recently when the asbestos scare came crashing down, plunging New York City into panic over the safety of its public schools. The story highlighted the appalling lack of maintenance in the city's school buildings, but it also illuminated a need to refurbish ways of thinking about architecture itself.   This is not the school story we were supposed to be reading this year. These were not the pictures we were supposed to see. Instead of the daily deluge of images of decaying floor tiles, falling-down ceilings and distraught parents, we were meant to be looking with pride and amazement at the remarkable new school buildings that have opened their doors this year throughout the city. The work of the School Construction Authority, a city agency established in 1988 with an appropriation of $4.3 billion, these new buildings represent one of the most important public works programs in the country. They ought to be illustrating an uplifting narrative about the city's ability to turn itself around. Instead, the School Construction Authority found itself mired in yet another episode in the continuing saga of urban decrepitude, as the asbestos rained down on its parade.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"MUSIC;\nHighlights of the Spirited New Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/music-highlights-of-the-spirited-new-season.html","abstract":"ARTS organizations in New Jersey have made it clear that their spirit will not be squelched by having to deal with the persistent reality of financial difficulties.

In their study of the impact of tax increases on the re-election chances of incumbent governors in 48 states between 1960 and 1989, Timothy Besley and Anne Case said that a governor who has presided over an increase of at least $100 per year in the tax bills of households earning $40,000 or more in 1976 dollars is 15 percent less likely to win another term than governors in states with lower increases or none at all.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"And on Sunday, Boggs (3 for 4) Can Rest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/sports/baseball-and-on-sunday-boggs-3-for-4-can-rest.html","abstract":"  When Wade Boggs went to sleep Friday night, he was laboring under the misconception that all he had to do was show up for yesterday's game against Detroit at Yankee Stadium, get a hit to guarantee the 11th .300 batting average of his career and then take the rest of the season off.   \"When I got here, Buck Showalter called me into his office and told me that instead of needing to get just one hit, I had to go 2 for 4,\" said Boggs, the five-time American League batting champion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Run-and-Shoot Offense Is Now Shooting Pardee","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/sports/football-notebook-run-and-shoot-offense-is-now-shooting-pardee.html","abstract":"  In recent days, two embattled coaches in the National Football League have received a vote of confidence from their club owners, and a vote of confidence often becomes a kiss of death.

Once a manufacturing district, now a traffic-clogged side street, West 18th between 5th and 7th Avenues is a bleak, industrial-looking stretch.

For those who know and appreciate them they provide escape, a communal relief from the blare of bestsellers. Here is the way books used to be, jumbled on shelves, cloth covers worn to thread by countless other hands. They conjure a time when information was precious, when reading was learning. A privilege.    These stores sell out-of print, rare and used books. An acquired taste, perhaps. Years ago, when the Strand was still on Fourth Avenue, surrounded by smaller competitors, that area proved a mecca for devotees of dust and Dostoevsky.

The most extravagant one is \"Ground Zero Texas,\" an interactive film that cost more than $3 million and required an unprecedented collaboration between Silicon Valley programmers and veterans of movies like \"Robocop.\"    Their product, to be introduced to the press on Tuesday and in stores next month, could be described as an action movie with a plot guided by the viewer, who watches on a television hooked to a Sega CD game machine. It could also be described as a video game with real scenery and actors. Its basic appeal was probably best summed up by Zack Kerns, aged 10, who went to the movie set in July to watch his father, Hubie Kerns Jr., play one of the extraterrestrial storm troopers invading a Texas border town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Stark, Simple Forms in a Picture-Perfect Setting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/nyregion/art-stark-simple-forms-in-a-picture-perfect-setting.html","abstract":"  THE Somerstown Gallery has left Somers to become the Schoolhouse Galleries here. And its new home really is a schoolhouse, a 1920's building situated on a hill so that the sun pours through its huge windows. The owner, Lee Pope, does not do things by halves: in addition to three large galleries, the space accommodates a theater and eight artists' studios, at least one of whose tenants commutes from Manhattan. A more picture-perfect setup can scarcely be imagined.    On view in the galleries now is a show by two sculptors, John Nesbitt and Brett Stern, and two painters, Ann Richardson and Jean Tate. Mr. Nesbitt is the most experienced of the four, having shown extensively in his own country, Canada, since the mid-1950's. He works with the precision of a jeweler, locking together by means of bolts and welds, forms in alabaster, marble, wood and various metals.    An example is the chunky bronze less than a foot tall, which is impregnated vertically by a sliver of lead and bisected horizontally by a layer of gray marble. In shape and general character the piece recalls Brancusi's kissing couple. There are other allusions to reality: a block of stained wood ornamented with bronze elements, which suggests a head, African style, and a bronze that could pass as a flowering plant growing out of a tree trunk.    Otherwise, Mr. Nesbitt remains a nonobjective sculptor deeply preoccupied with his craft, leaving the skins of his carved elements alternately rough and smooth, welding (or soldering) the cast shapes and combining them all into masses that are virtually watertight. One of his best efforts is a fence of small alabaster blocks. He is easily the best artist in the show.   Although Mr. Stern's is by far the largest contribution -- 13 ceramics -- art seems to be the least of his interests. Having billed himself in a resume as the president of Symagery, a one-man research and new-product development company, he goes on to list numerous accomplishments. These include a book titled \"99 Ways to Open a Beer Bottle Without a Bottle Opener\" and a method of manufacturing clothes without human intervention by way of a machine that can produce a garment in 45 seconds.   His achievements as a model maker include an eight-foot telephone for a television commercial, a four-foot brownie for National Kosher Foods and the beetle headdresses worn in the Broadway musical \"Cats.\" Way down at the bottom of Mr. Stern's remarkable document are listed the five ceramic shows in which he has participated during the last year or so, one of them at the American Craft Museum in Manhattan.   Given credits like these, a viewer might be forgiven for wondering why Mr. Stern wants to diversify and how he has the time to do so. But it is possible that he is following the example set by Samuel F. B. Morse when he turned to portraiture as a means of financing his scientific inventions. In any case, the ceramics are purely exercises in craft, being variations on a bifurcated shape that looks a lot like the lower half of a standing female torso. They come in black, gray and shades of brown, with a bubbly crater glaze on the outside and a smooth metallic luster applied to the crevices within.   Although not as obsessive as Mr. Stern, Ms. Tate also makes much of a small idea. Each of her five large canvases is stained or lightly sprayed with color and embossed with rectangles, triangles and dabs of impasto applied thick and glossy in irregular rows. The colors of these include ultramarine applied neat, and viridian seemingly glazed over white, and they generally hang against backgrounds tinted in a paler version of the same hue, accompanied by patches of, say, thin lemon yellow. Ms. Tate's canvases are not bad, but they would be better if she considered more carefully the effects that contiguous colors have on each other.   Ms. Richardson does consider these effects and, hence, has slightly more success with her variations on a single image. This is a disk enclosed by a rectangle, which in turn, is enclosed by two or three more rectangles. The disk, usually black, is often rimmed in a contrasting color, as are the squares, which come in various grays, thinly applied, generally over a contrasting hue. Nevertheless, the works seem more anxious than spontaneous. It's as if the artist does not want to push them further for fear of spoiling her happy accidents.   Despite its occasional good points, the show on the whole conveys a feeling of emptiness, a feeling that is more often found in suburban than urban galleries. Whether or not this is yet another side effect of zoning, Renee Kahn, a painter living in Stamford, has taken up arms against the problem by starting a Journal of American Suburban Art. Having circulated a leaflet with questions like \"Do you deny your suburban identity at New York parties?\" and \"Has living in the suburbs turned your brains to mush?\" Ms. Kahn plans a first issue based on the responses. In a telephone conversation, the artist explained that $1 mailed to the journal at 78 Webb's Hill Road, Stamford, Conn. 06903, will yield a photocopy of Volume 1, No. 1, mailed unbound in a paper bag. From little acorns. . .   The show at the Schoolhouse Galleries continues through Nov. 21. The phone number is 277-3461.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931003","headline":"Corrupt From Top to Bottom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/books/corrupt-from-top-to-bottom.html","abstract":"  THE PENTAGON WARS Reformers Challenge the Old Guard.

To be sure, recent opinion polls show the Mayor drawing support from about 90 percent of black people. It is not considered likely that black Democrats would switch to vote for Rudolph W. Giuliani.

With the cash flow from his fan base, Ilitch is willing and able to hire high-salaried role players like Paul Coffey and a high-salaried coach like Scotty Bowman, if only to look at their championship rings. Despite a wealth of talent, the Wings always seem to stumble, and last season's first-round exit from the playoffs was most embarrassing.   Part of the blame goes to the goalie, Tim Cheveldae, whose team loses its poise and confidence too easily whenever he falters. Bowman, in Pittsburgh last spring, showed that even one of the greats in league history can be outcoached, the way he was by Al Arbour of the Islanders.
