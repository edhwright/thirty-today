Importing a name performer to enliven a production and stir box-office response can be a two-edged tactic, as witnessed by John Rubinstein's rather overinflated star turn last season in the troupe's \"Princess Ida.\" Mr. Astin, however, sticks to his \"script,\" and managed both to wake up a wavering audience and to energize his fellow players for the rest of the evening.   Mr. Astin, known to television viewers as Gomez in the \"The Addams Family,\" sings hoarsely and tiptoes around upper notes by means of little shouts, but he bestows a deftly manic approach on his famous opening sequence and has the verbal agility to keep Gilbert's fast-moving patter under control.

The program had been postponed from Dec. 11. The juxtaposition of Church of England theatrics and South American tradition was initially jarring, but the performances had enough conviction to make the combination seem almost logical.   The Britten work is based on the life of the fourth-century bishop Nicolas, a rather fierce and fanatic dispenser of good works whom the modern figure of Santa Claus echoes as faintly as possible. The narration of various miraculous episodes culminates in Nicolas's bringing back to life three boys who had been killed and cooked by an unscrupulous butcher (sort of \"Peter Grimes\" in reverse). While the music is not Britten's finest, it has an immediate ceremonial effectiveness. Mr. Gardner expertly balanced and controlled the various vocal and instrumental forces, even though his chorus did not have an especially polished sound.

Every time Jupiter emerged from a cartoon cloud that opened like an elevator, a bell rang as if the deity were arriving at the ladies' foundations area of a department store. Sometimes the costumes made it seem that way as well: the nymph Pasithea appeared in an outfit that might have been from Frederick's of Hollywood, a bright red garter belt and stocking outfit with a white feather boa and a pair of handcuffs. Jupiter jumped into a bubble bath, apparently in his birthday suit. Even the musicians did not keep their minds on the score.   This was a production of \"Semele\" but hardly the \"Semele\" that Handel's operatic setting gives us with its pastoral scenes and hints of high tragedy. This opera is based on the very same libretto (written by the Restoration dramatist William Congreve) and was completed by the English composer John Eccles in late 1706. It takes the same story from Ovid, of the young girl (Semele) in love with a god (Jupiter); she is tricked by the god's jealous wife (Juno) into demanding to see him in divine form; she dies from the exposure. The composer -- Purcell's heir in the English theater -- never heard the work. It is influenced by Italian opera, with declaimed recitatives and da capo arias, but by the time \"Semele\" was ready for performance, the fashion in London demanded authenticity: operas in Italian from Italy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930111","headline":"Cowboys are Quicker on the Draw","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/11/sports/pro-football-cowboys-are-quicker-on-the-draw.html","abstract":"  Dallas's third touchdown, which gave them a 24-3 lead and put the game all but out of reach, came on a 23-yard run by Emmitt Smith in the third quarter. It came on a draw play that is one of the Cowboys' favorites; that also means they often execute it better than other plays because they enjoy running it. They have used it all season long and in both previous games against Eagles. No doubt Philadelphia had prepared for the play, so the fact that the Cowboys scored on it indicates how well it was executed.    Basically, it's a cutback draw. The Eagles knew this draw would be run but did not recognize it from this formation, which was a formation Dallas had been using in this game but not running the draw play on.

From the onset, Redford insisted on using flies that mimicked natural food forms rather than those flies known as \"attractors\" -- crass, overdressed lures which basically annoy trout into striking them. Redford's position, leaked early to the trades (\"Ordinary Bob Nixes Fruit Flies for Fish Pic\"), was part of the aura of integrity that had prevented his movie from being made for 14 years, but authenticity had its price.

Ann Stock, the vice president of public relations for Bloomingdale's, who divides her time between Washington and the New York department store, is Hillary Clinton's choice for a job that to some is as important as the White House chief of staff and, in its own way, wields almost as much power.   Nicki Hedrick, director of media relations at Bloomingdale's, confirmed today that Mrs. Stock had resigned to take the White House job, where she will hold sway over who gets invited to Presidential functions. Mrs. Clinton's office refused to comment on the appointment.   \"If you care about going to the White House it's a very powerful job,\" said Carolyn Peachey, president of Campbell, Peachey & Associates, a public relations firm. Intense Competition    After 12 years in a city where the most sought-after invitation is to a White House dinner, there are a lot of Democrats clamoring to get on the list.   Competition for the social secretary's position was intense. \"It always has been,\" said Sheila Tate, who was press secretary to Nancy Reagan and is now president of Powell Tate, a public relations firm. \"The job has great cachet.\"   Mrs. Stock, a former deputy press secretary to Vice President Walter F.  Mondale, was chosen from a list that included Ms. Peachey, who did not want to be considered; Susan O'Neill, daughter of the former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.; Liz Stevens, wife of the film director George Stevens, and Alma Viator, a vice president of the National Theater.   A number of people prominent in Georgetown's social circle were surprised by the choice, and telephone calls today soliciting their responses often began with comments like the one from Polly Kraft, wife of the lawyer and former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler: \"Do I know her?\" She Knows Washington    Mrs. Stock may not be a household name to the Georgetown crowd, but she has long experience in the capital. \"It's good that no Georgetown ladies know her,\" said Ms. Tate. \"She's fresh and unspoiled. She's a hard worker and she certainly knows Washington.\"   Everyone agrees that the White House social secretary should know Washington so as to navigate the treacherous political waters and the rocky protocol shores.   \"It's very important,\" said Muffie Brandon, now director of corporate programming for the Ford Motor Company and social secretary to Nancy Reagan from 1980 to 1983. \"The intricacies of this city, the nuances of political life and of protocol are not things you can learn on the job.\"    Mrs. Stock is not new to politics or to Washington. Besides working for Mr. Mondale, she volunteered for the Capital Children's Museum and helped raise the money to open it.  Other Qualifications    Those who know Mrs. Stock describe her as energetic, enthusiastic and creative, highly organized and very professional, qualities that are important in such a sensitive job.   \"There are toes that don't need to be stepped on,\" said Ms. Tate. \"You need to genuflect to certain people. It's important that she knows the traps and avoids needlessly offending people, just in terms of the Hill and the traditions and all the protocol.\"   Mrs. Stock, who is 46 and lives in nearby Alexandria, Va., graduated from Purdue University, where she majored in elementary education. She has been married to Stuart Stock, a partner at Covington & Burling, for 22 years. They have a 13-year-old son, Chase, who is a student at the Potomac School in McLean, Va.   She is a member of the Overseas Economic Fund's Women in Business Committee and founded the Washington Woman Roundtable, a group of 1,000 female executives who meet every three months to network. She was founder of Washington's \"Race for the Cure\" against breast cancer, and helped to organize the same event in New York City.   Mrs. Stock could not be reached for comment.

The fine, according to the league person, has not been appealed, as Oakley would have to file through the N.B.A. Players Association.

In deciding which team kicks off a football game, the toss of a real coin is random enough to satisfy all concerned. But the cost of even a slightly nonrandom string of electronic coin tosses can be devastating to both practical problem-solving and pure theory, and a new investigation has revealed that nonrandom computer tosses are much more common than many scientists had assumed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930112","headline":"Cuba's Economy, Cast Adrift, Grasps at Capitalist Solutions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/12/world/cuba-s-economy-cast-adrift-grasps-at-capitalist-solutions.html","abstract":"  The Karl Marx Cement Factory beckons from a road outside this provincial city with a cheery sign on which a likeness of the plant stands proudly above a rolling green landscape.
