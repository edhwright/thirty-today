Many professional athletes are given second chances, and third, and fourth. What matters is what they do with those chances.

It will be very hard for the Mayor to hold the narrow lead over his Republican challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, that he has in some polls. But the tightness of the contest has produced some transparently ugly politics.   Dinkins surrogates have used bigoted statements to rally the black vote; the Rev. William Jones's comment about \"fascist\" elements in the Giuliani campaign is an example. The Mayor's tepid disavowals opened him to the accusation that these statements were coordinated with his campaign. It is not enough for the Mayor to say mildly that \"I do not agree with every statement made by every supporter.\" As Mayor and candidate, he has been too given to tardiness and half-measures. What was needed was prompt, outright repudiations of remarks like that of Eric Adams, the black policeman who condemned Herman Badillo, the candidate for Comptroller on Mr. Giuliani's ticket, for marrying a woman who was not Puerto Rican.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931007","headline":"For St. Petersburg, It's All Just Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/world/struggle-in-russia-for-st-petersburg-it-s-all-just-politics.html","abstract":"  The city known in Soviet times as \"the Cradle of the Revolution\" sat this one out, and there was none of the massed public support for President Boris N.

Giuliani, dressed in red plaid jacket and discreet gold earrings, facing camera in office setting with warm wood-toned television cabinet in background. At one point, footage is interspersed of Mr. Giuliani in a hard hat and plaid workshirt, talking first with a white construction worker and then a black one at a building site. As she says her final lines, Ms. Giuliani first nods, then shakes her head just a bit. PRODUCER: The Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT: As a journalist, I thought I'd seen everything. I was wrong. I'm Donna, Rudy Giuliani's wife. My husband was called a fascist by a group of ministers endorsing David Dinkins. And while people who support the Mayor are called proud, people who support my husband are called racist. This election shouldn't be about race, it should be about competence. Of course I want people to vote for Rudy Giuliani. But I want them to vote for Rudy because he's the best man for the job, not for any other reason. ACCURACY: In endorsing the Mayor last week, the Rev. William H. Jones, the head of a black Baptist ministers group, said Mr. Dinkins had been unfairly branded a murderer in the death of a Hasidic scholar in Crown Heights and that people who made such charges included fascist \"elements\" that has grown around Mr. Giuliani. But he did not call Mr. Giuliani a fascist. While some Dinkins supporters have said that some white Democrats are backing Mr. Giuliani largely because of his race, Mr. Dinkins has never explicitly ascribed racial motives to them. The Mayor often says that for blacks to vote for a black or Italians to vote for an Italian is an expression of pride, while voting against someone because of his origin constitutes racism. SCORECARD: Mr. Giuliani often contends that Mr. Dinkins is too willing to paint himself as a victim of racial animosities, and this commercial, and a similar one by Mr. Giuliani's running mate for Comptroller, Herman Badillo, argues that Mr. Giuliani is the true victim -- of guilty liberal voters reluctant to oppose a black candidate. Without saying so, it objects that few politicians or pundits find it troubling that more than 90 percent of black voters back Mr. Dinkins, while often bemoaning the fact that barely one quarter of whites support the Mayor. That amounts to a call to arms to Mr. Giuliani's strongest white ethnic backers to support him with pride, and to white liberals to be offended by appeals to guilt and focus on competence instead. It trades on Ms. Giuliani's reputation as a former news anchorwoman for WPIX-TV to make its case in a Checkers meets Diane Sawyer vein, and sorrowful tone as she stands by her man puts a soft edge on a tough message. But the ad also risks seeming disengenuous: While ostensibly saying that race should not be an issue, it actually goes to great lengths to highlight and trade on racially inflammatory remarks.

Ms. Dean is a rigorous abstractionist who has worked with both ballet and modern-dance companies. Her love of patterning has led some theatergoers to call her a minimalist, although that designation in no way does justice to the intricacy and beauty of her choreography.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931007","headline":"Briton Insists He'll Push for Democracy in Hong Kong","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/07/world/briton-insists-he-ll-push-for-democracy-in-hong-kong.html","abstract":"  The Governor of Hong Kong said today that his yearlong effort had failed to win approval from China for his plan to expand democractic rule before Britain withdraws from the colony in 1997, and that he would proceed with the plan despite Chinese threats.

The small increase wouldn't be very important -- except for the fact that last year's experience is part of a disturbing story that's been unfolding for a decade or more. The proportion of Americans living in poverty -- for a family of four, that means living on less than $14,335 in 1992 -- is now 14.5 percent, which is only slightly lower than it was in the 1960's.

While his former associates Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Theodore C. Sorensen worked hard to cement the myth of Camelot, revisionist historians have gone at that myth with sledgehammers. To Garry Wills (\"The Kennedy Imprisonment\"), Kennedy was a compulsive risk taker, obsessed with image and style. To Thomas C.

At the moment, evidence of their influence can be found, quite literally, all over town, in the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum, in Peter Saul's paintings at the Frumkin Gallery on West 57th Street and in the SoHo shows of the young painter Christian Schumann at Postmasters and the sculptor Daniel Weiner at Germans van Eck.    But enough about influence. A sizable portion of the real thing is now having its say in \"Comic Power,\" a sprawling survey organized by John Carlin and Carlo McCormick, with the assistance of Melissa Rachleff, at Exit Art/The First World, in SoHo. Admittedly, the comics under scrutiny are not, for the most part, the all-American kind that influenced Pop artists like Mr. Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol or the lapsed Abstract Expressionist Philip Guston, although a historical section devoted to newspaper comic strips from 1898 to 1945 includes examples of Chester Gould's \"Dick Tracy\" and George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"Breeders' Cup Countdown Begins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/sports/horse-racing-notebook-breeders-cup-countdown-begins.html","abstract":"  Belmont Park started its countdown to the Breeders' Cup yesterday when a dozen of the leading contenders for 1993 championships were entered in this weekend's major stakes here, one month before they gather again with all of the horse clans for the main event.

Combat\" and \"Secret Hearts\" (\"I don't care! I'd rather sink -- than call Brad for help!\"), not even his most ardent admirers could have predicted how rich a creative vein he had tapped. Everyone saw at the time -- how could they have seen otherwise? -- the giant pin that was Mr. Lichtenstein's art aimed at the hot-air balloon of Abstract Expressionism. He was regarded as a saboteur and a provocateur, but how far could he go with those big, cartoonish spoofs?   Very far, it turns out. So far, in fact, that the end is still not in sight. What makes the gigantic Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum so particularly remarkable is this almost miraculous sense of unfolding possibilities. Ideas tumble out of his work like circus clowns out of a Volkswagen. By the time you reach the top of the museum's ramp you may well wonder how the same artist who in 1961 was cribbing from an advertisement for Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos to come up with an image of a girl holding a beach ball could have conceived in the 1980's and early 90's vast compositions that seamlessly weave references to Picasso and Magritte, the Futurists and Expressionists, not to say to Mr. Lichtenstein himself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"Review/Film; Waking Up In a Future Of Muscles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/movies/review-film-waking-up-in-a-future-of-muscles.html","abstract":"Typical futuristic action-melodrama.

All three performances (the others are tomorrow and Tuesday) were sold out in advance.   The work, a City Opera commission, opened a world-premiere festival in honor of the company's 50th anniversary, in which three new works are being presented on consecutive evenings. But unless one comes to \"Marilyn\" already obsessed by Monroe's mixture of come-hither glances and childlike behavior; unless one finds her death tragic rather than merely sad, there will be very little in this opera to justify three hours of dutiful attention.

Maxwell's four-hour cinematic re-creation of the battle that was the turning point of the Civil War has a stately tone and meticulous attention to historical detail that make it feel more like an epic documentary than a dramatic film. \"Gettysburg,\" adapted by Mr. Maxwell from Michael Shaara's novel \"The Killer Angels,\" limits itself to the first three days of July 1863, when 150,000 soldiers threw themselves into a battle in which more than a quarter of them became casualties.    Probably no American movie has devoted more time to discussions of battlefield strategy than \"Gettysburg,\" which is a film to warm the cockles of a military tactician's heart. Its battle scenes, which used more than 5,000 Civil War re-enactors surging over the actual site of the original conflict, are impressively choreographed. In their sweep and grandeur, these scenes convey a strong visceral sense of what fighting a war used to be like.

Lukas Foss meant \"Griffelkin,\" an opera about a 10-year-old devil who can't quite succeed in hell, to appeal to both children and adults, and I think it will. If the revised version of the score, which had its premiere on Thursday night, were pruned, particularly in the second act, it could become a minor classic.   \"Griffelkin\" avoids almost all the pitfalls of adult works about, and partly for, children: it swerves into sentimentality without becoming mawkish; it celebrates innocence without being banal, and it never condescends to its characters or its subject. Mr. Foss's score, which includes a fair number of academic niceties (including a canon and lighthearted allusions to Mozart), is instantly accessible, managing to recall Stravinsky, Copland and hints of the young Leonard Bernstein, while still sounding original. It has its longueurs and times of forced gaiety and tumult, particularly in the last half of the second act (the first act could easily be combined with the second), but the third act is strikingly sure-footed. Overall, Mr. Foss's wry music is a fine foil for Alastair Reid's literate, often rhyming libretto.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931009","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/09/arts/classical-music-in-review-229793.html","abstract":"  Chie Sato Roden  Pianist Weill Recital Hall","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931009","headline":"Religion Notes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/09/us/religion-notes.html","abstract":"  Ecumenically Environmental   When you talk about grass roots, you can't get much more local than the houses of worship that dot every city in America.

But in nearly two years as Pakistan's Prime Minister, she impressed neither friend or foe. Her People's Party failed to enact a single measure of any consequence. Dismissed from office by a hostile President on charges of abuse of power, Ms. Bhutto was beaten at the polls by Nawaz Sharif. Now, in a dramatic comeback, her left-of-center party has just outvoted Mr. Sharif's business-oriented Pakistan Muslim League.   This is sweet vindication for Benazir Bhutto, and for the most part, good news for Pakistan. The big losers were militant Islamic parties, which won only 9 seats in the 217-seat Parliament. After years of dictatorship and turbulence, Pakistan seems to be evolving a stable two-party system. Mr. Sharif has emerged as a leader in his own right, and can no longer be dismissed as a tool of the military.
