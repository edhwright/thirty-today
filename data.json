The reasons for the latest abandonment are the same that curtailed other nuclear construction around the country -- ballooning costs and uncertainty about when plants could finally be brought on line. Although the T.V.A. had already spent $6.3 billion on the units and they were from 57 percent to 88 percent completed, the authority estimated it could cost up to $8.8 billion more to finish the job.

Inside a flickering candlelit pleasure dome, they are plied with wine and meat by aggressive prostitutes who wear bizarre, towering headdresses. Within minutes, the monks have broken most of the 10 prohibitions that were solemnly taught them by a 10-year-old holy man.    Midway in the orgy, General Shi (Wu Hsin-kuo), a warrior who has disguised himself as a monk, is led by his sometime lover Princess Scarlet (Joan Chen) into an inner sanctum with a bathing pool. As they begin to make love, they are joined by drunken monks and prostitutes laughing and thrashing around wildly. The revels are cut short when the child monk reveals that there is a 10,000-tael reward for Shi's arrest and removal to the imperial capital.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Mexico Sets Up a Panel to Respond to Rebels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/world/mexico-sets-up-a-panel-to-respond-to-rebels.html","abstract":"  The Government has formed a multi-party legislative commission to resolve the conflict with rebels in Chiapas and to ease tensions that have reached their highest level.

For its current exhibition, \"Orientalism: Visions of the East in Western Dress,\" the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art has focused on the fashion aspects of this fascination. Starting with a man's Chinese velvet cape made in Portugal in the late 16th century, the exhibition ranges through almost five centuries. It ends with contemporary styles by Jean-Paul Gaultier, Giorgio Armani, Gianni Versace, Oscar de la Renta and others.   Only two modern Asian designers are included, both from Japan. Hanae Mori uses a calligraphy print for evening gowns with a calm, classic look. Issey Miyake, who has always been more concerned with developing new fashion paths than with revisiting old ones, is responsible for three experimental designs, all in his new pleated fabric.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Arrest of Financier, Accused of Stealing, Shakes Barcelona","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/world/arrest-of-financier-accused-of-stealing-shakes-barcelona.html","abstract":"  People in Barcelona were accustomed to seeing Javier de la Rosa, a maverick financier, met by investment bankers, Middle Eastern sheiks and Government ministers as he stepped from his Mercedes-Benz limousine.

The CD's range in price from $6.98 to $16.98. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Nancy LaMott    \"JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS\" (Midder). Nancy LaMott is a model of unaffected sweetness in a cabaret field crowded with poseurs, and her spare, intimate Christmas album projects the same aura of cleancut nostalgia as her live performances. Outstanding cuts include a witty \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" in which the a cappella quintet Hudson Shad buzzes around her like Santa's helpers, and a wistful \"I'll Be Home for Christmas.\" On \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" she parries with Michael Feinstein.

So, with the sun beating down and the temperature hovering near 90, Els blazed his way around the Tryall Club in the first round of the $2.5 million Johnny Walker World Championship. With an ease that is becoming a trademark, he shot a round of 64 that tied the course record on the par-71 layout and gave him a three-stroke lead over three players.

Kofi, the lead singer and dancer of the Odomankoma Kyerema Cultural Troupe from Ghana, has taken Christmas carols as exercises in deft arranging. He uses bouncy reggae bass lines and adds gimmicks above them: percussive dancehall rapping, percolating electronics and choral-harmony African syllables, brand-new melodies between verses of familiar ones, even a soca version of \"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing.\" The buoyant singers include Kofi, Bebe Winans, the dancehall rapper Daddy Freddy and members of Take 6, and the music makes the most of its own slickness.

This CD collects the entirety of Elvis Presley's two holiday records (\"Elvis's Christmas Album\" from 1957 and \"Elvis Sings the Wonderful World of Christmas\" from 1971) and adds four alternate versions of songs. For some performers, that would be enough of a retrospective. But not for Presley. Some CD's of \"If Every Day Was Like Christmas\" have been specially packaged to include a pop-up wintertime picture of Presley's Graceland estate. This kind of kitsch pretty much sums up the uninspired songs from 1971 on the collection (with the exception of the rhythm-and-blues jam \"Merry Christmas Baby\").

Backed by orchestras and choirs or small pop-jazz groups, she shows off the creamy voice that her disco hits never revealed.

As the rumblings from the House Democratic leader, Richard Gephardt, suggest, Mr. Clinton also faces a crisis of anxiety within his own party. At a minimum, his speech probably showed Democrats that he had the stomach for the difficult task of self-rejuvenation.   Given the size of that task, a speech of only 10 minutes did not bespeak much in the way of confidence, but the President looked more focused than he has in recent weeks. Mr. Clinton must be nagged by a sense of lost opportunities. In 23 months, he has skidded from initiator to imitator.

Washington can begin that effort now. It is renegotiating a 1958 agreement with Euratom, the European Union's atomic energy agency, which is due to expire at the end of next year.

If there is no resolution of the strike, Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner said, \"next Thursday or Friday morning at 12:01 A.M., the implementation process will begin.\" The owners' 25-3 vote today gave the executive council, which Selig heads, the authority to declare an impasse and implement the clubs' final offer, the salary cap they proposed Nov. 17.     The decision was contingent on the union's agreement to postpone two deadlines dealing with player contracts. Donald Fehr, the union chief, said from New York he would recommend to the players' executive board that the union agree to the postponements.   Although Selig and John Harrington, chairman of the negotiating committee, emphasized that the owners acted solely in the interest of negotiating an agreement with the players, the decision raised the possibility at least that the owners became concerned that if they had acted today, they would have been declaring an impasse in the talks prematurely.   When the clubs' negotiators left Rye Brook, N.Y., on Wednesday, they were in the middle of perhaps the most promising period of the talks since negotiations began in earnest six months ago.   If the owners had declared an impasse today, they might have strengthened the union's challenge of the move before the National Labor Relations Board. An employer can declare an impasse in talks any time he chooses, but he has to be prepared to defend the action in the face of a union challenge.   The owners initially had scheduled the meeting to act on implementation for Dec. 5, but they emerged from a bargaining session in Leesburg, Va., on Nov. 30 and announced they had agreed to postpone the meeting for 10 days to give negotiations additional time to work. At the time, it appeared they had acted at the urging of Bill Usery Jr., the mediator.   But some management people since have suggested that the owners themselves wanted to delay the meeting and the vote.   Although Usery said last week that implementation would be \"very, very unfortunate,\" Harrington said today that the mediator had not asked the owners to delay their vote again.   \"He just asked us not to do anything or say anything that would preclude continuing collective bargaining in the spirit we had conducted collective bargaining,\" Harrington said at a news conference at the O'Hare Hilton. \"I think he will be surprised at this move.\"   Selig did not identify the three clubs that voted no. However, Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles was on record as saying he would oppose implementation, and the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers or the New York Mets were believed to be the other two clubs with negative votes.   Obviously, the overwhelming majority of owners are eager to implement the salary cap if the two sides are unable to reach agreement on a new collective bargaining contract. But they also don't want to put themselves at risk legally.   Taking the positive approach, Selig said: \"If there's a scintilla of a chance to have a meaningful solution at the table, you've got to try it. If you fail, you try again.\"   Fehr said it was positive that the owners were willing to continue negotiations without a salary cap in place. But he added, \"I can't tell you what it will lead to.\"   He said the union would hold internal meetings this weekend, then be prepared to resume negotiations on Monday. The talks, he said, could be held in Washington, Usery's home turf.   Reacting to Harrington's characterization of the owners' move as an olive branch, Fehr said, \"I hope it turns out to be one.\"   As to what might have happened to change the atmosphere, he said: \"There were some discussions that seemed to be of a more constructive tone. And I think everybody agrees on that.\"   Talks had been stalled on the union's refusal to accept a salary cap or a luxury tax on payrolls that could act like a cap. The owners removed their latest tax proposal, the one they made last Sunday in reply to a players' proposal 24 hours earlier, from the table Tuesday in Rye Brook.   \"We're back to a salary cap,\" they told union negotiators.   But during a bargaining session late Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning, the clubs' representatives, for the first time, indicated that they might have some flexibility on the way they would tax payrolls.    That idea caught the players' attention, and the two sides returned to the table Wednesday afternoon in a more hopeful manner. But while the union offered seemingly conciliatory ideas on elements of the owners' revenue-sharing plan that is linked to a salary cap, it did not produce a proposal the owners' negotiators said they expected and were waiting for.   The management team ended the talks at that point and flew here for today's meeting.   \"On the way in,\" Harrington related, \"we reviewed all the alternatives that were available to us. We met again this morning at 9 o'clock. The committee concluded on a unanimous basis to make the recommendation we made to the full ownership. It was done in the spirit of opening one more window of opportunity.\"   Harrington said the owners' willingness \"to walk through those doors of deadlines and open them again should show we're dead-set to negotiate a resolution of this dispute.\"   The two deadlines in question deal with clubs' salary arbitration offers to retain rights to their free agents plus the players' responses and the tendering of contracts to unsigned players on clubs' 40-man rosters.   The arbitration offer deadline was Dec. 7 and the response deadline on Monday. On Nov. 30, those were pushed back to Dec. 17 and 23. Clubs must tender contracts to unsigned players by Dec. 20. The new deadline for and tenders is Dec. 23. The deadline for players response to arbitration offers most likely will be Jan. 4. But the arbitration offers will become immaterial if the clubs implement a salary cap.   In all of his talk about the clubs' fervent desire to negotiate a new system rather than implementing one, Selig sounded one ominous note.   \"If the union really wants to reach an agreement,\" Selig said, \"we're going to give it more time, but it must address our central issue -- establishing a relationship between revenues and salaries.\"   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Shopping and Weather:The Holiday Mood on City Streets : Hong Kong","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/style/IHT-shopping-and-weatherthe-holiday-mood-on-city-streets-hong-kong.html","abstract":"Christmas is tough for taitais - which means Mrs. in Mandarin but in its common use refers to women who already have time to shop every day of the year.

The annual harvest of Christmas albums occupies a zone in between. A lucky few will survive to be hauled out every year along with the ornaments; the others will probably be forgotten by New Year's Eve.    Performers in search of a perennial place on the airwaves add contemporary trappings to familiar songs, or come up with new songs about the season, with sentiments from loneliness to reverence to mistletoe-enhanced lust. There are Christmas blues and Christmas raps, Christmas rockers and Christmas weepers. Christmas albums always reveal a healthy crop of corn, even as they provide a chance to hear exactly which recent styles have been absorbed by mainstream pop fabricatos. Yet now and then, through the commercial tinsel, a hint of the season's faith or a touch of its benevolence can be gleaned.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941216","headline":"Showdown Over a Chancellor; Cortines Has Wide Support, but Giuliani Might Still Win","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/nyregion/showdown-over-chancellor-cortines-has-wide-support-but-giuliani-might-still-win.html","abstract":"  As Mayor Rudolph W.

This week I have also walked in those paths, sampling a few of the many performances this work ritually receives every December, marveling again at the unearthly simplicity of \"Behold, I tell you a mystery,\" the tenderness of \"He was despised and rejected,\" and the robust vigor of Handel's conception of God and man. This oratorio has an uncanny ability to survive almost any performance, shedding glory on the players even if they do not always return the favor, allowing itself to be freely molded in the image of the musical worshiper.   Those images once included gargantuan performances like the one in London with 3,500 choristers that George Bernard Shaw wrote about in 1891. That tradition, a reflection of the British empire at the height of its power, is much more modestly preserved in the New York performances of the Oratorio Society or the Masterwork Chorus, but Handel today is generally far less grandiose and less awesome. There is a presumption of familiarity in the performances. The forces are usually smaller, informed by the authenticity movement; the singing is less stentorian and less connected to operatic styles. Trumpets sound, good tidings are told and the Lord reign eth without the music's seeming to come from some realm beyond the earthly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941217","headline":"Johnson Staying in TV","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/sports/sports-people-football-johnson-staying-in-tv.html","abstract":"  JIMMY JOHNSON plans to announce that he has decided to stay in television, but may return to coaching after a three-year network contract expires, The Dallas Morning News reported yesterday.

Beginning Monday in Washington, they will take another swing at the opportunity they might have missed in Rye Brook, N.Y., this past Wednesday.

some movement in their effort to settle the longest strike in sports history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19941217","time":"1994-12-17
