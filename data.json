Before an audience of students sprawled on the white stone or crowded around a buffet table set up for the school's year-end picnic, Eugene Park was going through an ear-splitting, high-voltage rendition of a Hungarian czardas by Vittorio Monti.   This was a crowd that knew its Monti and liked what it was hearing. Mr. Park, a first-year student whose face was obscured by long hair, rocked back and forth on his heels in the slower sections, building anticipation, then let it rip in the fast passages, bow hairs snapping as he punished the strings of his electric violin. It was Paganini with a few dashes of Pete Townshend thrown in for extra attitude. The students clapped and whistled, grateful perhaps for diversion from the week's main focus: solo performances before a faculty jury to determine their final grades. The Advent of Change    It was a scene at odds with the traditional picture of Juilliard, the most prestigious conservatory in the United States, and perhaps in the world, one whose graduates account for about 20 percent of the musicians in the Big Five American orchestras (and half of those in the New York Philharmonic).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930602","headline":"ATTACK ON YELTSIN STEPPED UP BY FOE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/02/world/attack-on-yeltsin-stepped-up-by-foe.html","abstract":"  Vice President Aleksandr V.

Despite new treatments that prolong life, in the last three decades there has been little improvement in long-term survival. Early, curable ovarian cancer produces no symptoms, and three-fourths of cases are not diagnosed until the cancer has spread beyond the ovarian capsule.   Once the disease has advanced beyond the ovary, fewer than 10 percent of women are cured. But if it is detected and treated early, 90 percent survive, a fact that has prompted a frantic search for cost-effective ways to screen women for early signs.

The finalists are Armen Babakhanyan, 25, of Armenia; Fabio Bidini, 24, of Italy; Valery Kuleshov, 30, of Russia; Simone Pedroni, 24, of Italy; Johan Schmidt, 28, of Belgium, and Christopher Taylor, 23, of the United States.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/nyregion/c-corrections-497193.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday about the installation of a sculpture of a bull at Madison Square in Manhattan misidentified the sponsor.

It is wrong for Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and other conservative Republican senators to oppose a Presidential nomination for executive office for such disagreement.   Opponents of Professor Guinier argue that since senators used Robert Bork's academic writings against him during his unsuccessful effort to be confirmed as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Professor Guinier's academic writings are likewise a basis to refuse to confirm her as an Assistant Attorney General. What that false analogy overlooks is that when Mr. Bork was nominated for an executive office in the Department of Justice -- solicitor general -- his academic writings were not used against him. Despite strong disagreement with his academic views, senators voted overwhelmingly to confirm him as solicitor general because they knew he was serving as part of the President's team, not as a free agent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"Senate Passes a Civil-Rights Bill To Safeguard Access to Abortion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/nyregion/senate-passes-a-civil-rights-bill-to-safeguard-access-to-abortion.html","abstract":"  Seeking to safeguard access to clinics where abortions are performed, the Connecticut Senate today approved a broad civil-rights statute that would make it a crime to use force or physical obstruction to deny someone the equal protection of state or Federal laws.

It's legitimate to argue that the police did a bad job of protecting the Jewish population in Brooklyn's Crown Heights section during the riots in the summer of 1991. The police did do a bad job. But to call the riots a pogrom, as former Mayor Edward Koch, the mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani and others persist in doing, is not only wrong -- and inflammatory -- but an insult to those who lived through the real thing.    My late father didn't speak often about his childhood in Eastern Europe. But when he did it was with a steely anger, a transforming bitterness that he carried with him all 89 years of his life. Though he left Poland when he was only 6, he could vividly recall nights when Cossacks would sweep through his village on horseback, beating, maiming and murdering Jews for one reason -- because they were Jewish. He remembered fleeing and hiding, and he remembered the confused fear of a child who could not make sense of what was, after all, incomprehensible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930603","headline":"The Two-Faced West : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/opinion/IHT-the-twofaced-west-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"One Face of Islam\" (Letters, May 18) by Robert J.

Harmony","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/opinion/l-kurds-and-christians-live-in-harmony-727593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Christian Sects in Kurdish Lands Dwindle\" (letter, May 24), Alastair Bruton claims that the numbers of Christians living in the Kurdish area in the north of Iraq and southeast of Turkey have been reduced from 25,000 to 200 or 300 \"because the Kurds told them they had no future in a land the Kurds would soon control.\" Mr. Bruton concludes by appealing for the linkage of \"safeguards\" to Western aid earmarked for the peoples of Kurdistan-Iraq because otherwise the West will be facilitating \"ethnic cleansing\" there.   Throughout this century, Muslim Kurds and Christian Assyrians and Chaldeans in Kurdistan-Iraq have enjoyed good and cooperative relations. In the 1930's, for example, the Kurds did not retaliate against Christians who displaced them, in collaboration with British colonialists, from the oil-rich area of Kirkuk. More recently, some Christians have joined Kurdish political parties.   In the 1980's, many Christians left the Kurdish area for Baghdad or destinations abroad for economic reasons. Iraqi Kurds, themselves victims of chemical warfare and an operation that, it is estimated, claimed the lives of 180,000 Kurds, were hardly in a position to force any other people out of the region.    Some Christians fled to Turkey in the April 1991 refugee exodus and refused to return for economic reasons or because they had no homes to which to return. This is documented in reports released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and in an April 1992 investigation report by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.   In the last year, in preparation for the May 1992 election, the Kurdistan Front set aside 5 seats (out of 105) for Christians in the new Kurdish Parliament. This quota assured the representation of Chaldeans and other Christian groups. Because the two major parties hold 50 seats each, the Christian members of the Kurdish Parliament will cast the deciding votes should a stalemate arise.   As the Iraqi military again looms as an ominous presence on the horizon of Kurdistan-Iraq, the fledgling democracy deserves and needs Western humanitarian aid as long as its leaders apply the law equitably to all people.

Interviews with some two dozen of the 668 Tony voters, and a few well-informed nonvoters (all were guaranteed anonymity) indicated that the two shows, each of which garnered 11 nominations, were in a dead heat for the best-musical award and that otherwise a division of the spoils is likely. Many agree that the best-musical award could go to one and best director to the other. One prediction -- call it the necessary-but-not-sufficient theory -- espoused by Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, is this: Because the Broadway musical tradition revolves around a good story, \"Kiss\" isn't likely to win best musical without winning best book. And because the pleasure of \"Tommy\" is so tied to its fantastical staging, it isn't likely to win best musical without winning best director. Terrence McNally's book could win, he added, and \"Kiss\" could still lose; ditto for Des McAnuff's direction and \"Tommy.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930604","headline":"Sounds Around Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/arts/sounds-around-town-221093.html","abstract":"  Remembering Sun Ra   Sun Ra Tribute, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300.

The musical elements include cello, train whistle, bass and electric keyboard. Performance art meets cabaret meets rock with a hint of funk. Show times are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11:15, and tickets are $25 and $20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930604","headline":"3 Candidates Striving to Leave No Republican Unturned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/nyregion/3-candidates-striving-to-leave-no-republican-unturned.html","abstract":"  Jim Wallwork came here to greet noontime shoppers and noshers around the Morristown Green today at a campaign stop that showed the difficulties of winning votes in the Republican primary for governor.
