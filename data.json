Dozens of New Yorkers have called or written to report their own encounters with a neatly dressed young black man with red hair and freckles who seems, somehow, to know them -- drawing the information out of them that he needs. Others wrote of similar cons. While there is not space for all of those tales, here is one with  a twist. \n\n      ON a springish night in 1993, I was walking down the Avenue of the Americas  with my girlfriend, Nancy.

(St. Martin's, $22.95), an absorbing, panoramic novel set in the waning Wild West days of British Columbia. It's that  good: intricately plotted, meticulously researched and shaded with nuance. In \"Shoot!\" the Canadian poet and novelist George Bowering tells the story of four  young men whose Indian mothers and white fathers earn them the dismissive status of half-breeds. Caught between two cultures that neither understand nor accept them, the boys tumble self-destructively from petty thievery to murder. With page after page of thundering hoofbeats, shoot-outs and blood-red sunsets, Shoot! does the western genre proud. But what truly distinguishes this novel is  Mr. Bowering's unflinching examination of bigotry and intolerance, which seems as relevant to today's world as to that of the 1870's. Steady doses of wit and adventure help his brusque prose recover from occasional didactic detours, and a spiraling narrative structure gives the old-fashioned setting some post-modern flair. If nothing else, discovering the source of its deceptively hee-haw title  is reason enough to tempt plenty of curious readers.

A brilliant colorist whose work is often seen as falling somewhere  between representation and abstraction, Mr. Hodgkin \"does not allow illustration to interfere with the making of a painting,\" Mr. Auping writes. \"Memory and metaphor are his preferred terrain.\" Mr. Auping finds that Mr. Hodgkin's paintings of the last two decades have forged the unlikely pairing of Intimism and Expressionism from wildly diverse influences like Henri Matisse, douard Vuillard, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning. Or as the cultural critic Susan Sontag puts it in her illuminating meditation: \"Hodgkin has understood that if the pictures are dense enough, they can go in two directions, doing justice to intimate textures as well as to emotions of a large expressiveness.

Now he's 6, and trying to do it again, with some expert guidance from his jockey, Jerry Bailey.  \n\n     The 38-year-old Bailey is a star in his own right. He was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame last year and also received the Eclipse Award as 1995's top  jockey. He has been riding Thoroughbreds for two decades, long enough, as he makes clear in this article, to appreciate the once-in-a-lifetime experience that Cigar represents.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Theaters Stick Together To Survive, and Flourish","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/l-theaters-stick-together-to-survive-and-flourish-020648.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"LONG ISLAND JOURNAL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/long-island-journal-019712.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"MAILBOX;Hall of Fame Criteria","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/sports/l-mailbox-hall-of-fame-criteria-022233.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"THE NEW YORK TIMES BUSINESS BEST SELLERS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/business/the-new-york-times-business-best-sellers.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Longer Life for Detectors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/us/longer-life-for-detectors.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/travel/c-corrections-018864.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Our Towns;In Suburb, Marianne Is An Enigma","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/our-towns-in-suburb-marianne-is-an-enigma.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"SOAPBOX: Maestro, and More;Remembering Henry Lewis, Alight With Intensity","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/soapbox-maestro-and-moreremembering-henry-lewis-alight-with.html","abstract":"YOU did not have to be a musician to enjoy Henry Lewis.

Which is also to say that his unrelenting enthusiasm could drive you crazy. \n\n     Henry loved movies, all kinds, from Jean Cocteau's classic \"Orpheus\" to Steven Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" But you could not simply watch a movie with him; he had ideas about them. Ninety minutes of any film, good or bad, would draw forth hours of theorizing.

Since then, our income tax system has consistently raised the revenue needed to meet the Government's spending decisions. Through two world wars and a worldwide Depression, the income tax system has proven capable, flexible and dependable. \n\n     But today a national debate rages over whether we should retain this system or return to a consumption-based tax system.

Because roots function mostly out of sight, gardeners have conjured up some pretty fanciful assumptions about how they grow. Such misconceptions permeate gardening behavior and have distorted how almost every shade tree and fruit tree in America is watered, mulched and fertilized. Here are some common myths about root growth: \n\n  MYTH NO. 1: TREE ROOTS ARE AS WIDE AS THE CANOPY.  This old adage is as widespread as it is wrong. In heavy clay soils, which have little air and offer  a lot of resistance to root hairs, tree roots may grow only half again as wide as the canopy, but well beyond its canopy's edge, also called the \"dripline.\" In sandy soils, which offer less physical resistance, roots will often grow up to three times as wide. In a shallow soil on top of a clay or hardpan layer, the roots may wander out to an area five times as wide as the canopy in search of moisture and nutrients.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Archives"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Making Records Far From the Urban Beat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/making-records-far-from-the-urban-beat.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"World News Briefs;Mutiny in Guinea Reportedly Resolved","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/world/world-news-briefs-mutiny-in-guinea-reportedly-resolved.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"ON THE JOB;Is This the Bronx Zoo?

The appliance division, he and others surmised, appeared to be in serious marketing trouble. \n\n     But the attendees soon learned that the problem had nothing to do with pricing, advertising or other basic marketing tasks. \"Up speaks a GE Capital guy and puts up his chart showing consumer debt reaching saturation levels,\" said Steven Kerr, vice president of leadership development at G.E.  \"Suddenly, everyone had a whole new angle on the problem.\" That new perspective led the employees to try solutions not from marketing but rather from finance, such as new ways to help debt-laden customers pay for big-ticket appliances.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"On Language;Congenital, Liar, Punch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/magazine/on-language-congenital-liar-punch.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Scientific Sleuths Hope to Track Pollutants to Their Sources","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/us/scientific-sleuths-hope-to-track-pollutants-to-their-sources.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960204","headline":"200 Killed in Quake in Southwest China","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/world/200-killed-in-quake-in-southwest-china.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Djuna and the Scholars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/books/l-djuna-and-the-scholars-018970.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"BEST SELLERS: February 4, 1996","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/books/best-sellers-february-4-1996.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"POP MUSIC;The Sorry State Of New York Radio","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/arts/pop-music-the-sorry-state-of-new-york-radio.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"A Raw French Film Survives Translation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/movies/a-raw-french-film-survives-translation.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"A City's Deer Called Too Costly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/a-city-s-deer-called-too-costly.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"DOES A SUGAR BEAR BITE?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/magazine/l-does-a-sugar-bear-bite-019178.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Neighborhood Report;City's Compromise On 14th St. Armory Pleases Local Groups","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/neighborhood-report-city-s-compromise-on-14th-st-armory-pleases-local-groups.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960204","headline":"Neighborhood Report;The Gritty and the Gentry Battle for a Waterfront's Soul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/nyregion/neighborhood-reportthe-gritty-and-the-gentry-battle-for-a.html","abstract":"Pockets of homes dot the industrially dominated streets of western Red Hook,  where ships' men once lived and maritime voyagers slept. Today the link between  home and work is gone: most residents work away from the area and the small-business owners largely live outside the neighborhood. \n\n     The tension has grown as residents who have moved in over the last five years or so seek to transform the commercial character of the waterfront neighborhood  into a mixed-use enclave.
