But his performance rating has slipped, his trust rating has slipped and so has his reputation for honesty and integrity.

Birt Illustrated. 192 pages. Harry N. Abrams. $39.95.   How does a photographer find his subject? Or must his subject find him? When young Alfred Stieglitz came home from Berlin in 1899, he claimed that New York City was photo-resistant. He had to see the rambunctious vaudevillians Weber and Fields and the great Eleanora Duse in \"Camille\" before he got it: New York's sights, rhythms, tones and sensations dictated their own rules. It was up to the photographer to grasp and make use of them.   Young James VanDerZee came to New York from pastoral Lenox, Mass., in 1908, and he came as a waiter, an elevator operator and a musician. When he finally opened his photography studio in 1917, his subject was Harlem, a city within a city, and its rules were wildly contradictory. What had first been a haven for upper-class Anglo-Saxons had then become a haven for middle- and working-class Irish, Italians and Jews, and was fast becoming a haven for upper-, middle- and working-class blacks from the South, the West and the Caribbean.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"DOLE WEAKENING HAITI RESOLUTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/world/dole-weakening-haiti-resolution.html","abstract":"  Apparently lacking the votes to pass a resolution tightly restricting President Clinton's military options in Haiti, Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, negotiated with the White House today about watering it down.

Surf music, guitar-based and full of huge, whooshing sounds, is the expression of a certain type of innocent American modernity, pure California and pre-pollution, -Watergate and -Vietnam. Mr. Dale, playing a Fender Stratocaster, the quintessential American pop guitar, was hellbent on making noise. He ran his fingers up and down the fret board in long glissandos, sending shimmering metallic sounds out into the room. And he twanged away, letting the low notes ring like a jackhammer on a construction site.

With its cracker-barrel humor, metaphorical use of the Mississippi River and poignant attempts to bridge the vast American racial divide, \"Show Boat\" is the Broadway musical's answer to \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\" Or would be if Twain had had Florenz Ziegfeld's taste for soaring melodies and lavish spectacle.    In today's American theater, there may be no artist more indebted to \"Show Boat\" than Harold Prince, whose entire career, from the original production of \"West Side Story\" to the current \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" has been devoted to building on the serious musical that Kern and Hammerstein invented. So it is no surprise that Mr. Prince's staging of \"Show Boat\" here, as the opening attraction of the North York Performing Arts Center, is a seismic event in the American musical theater. Given a huge budget, an enormous cast in which Broadway stalwarts vastly outnumber local recruits, and a house that resembles the mammoth Gershwin Theater back home, Mr. Prince has approached the piece as if it were a new work that might have been submitted to him by Stephen Sondheim shortly after their collaboration on \"Sweeney Todd.\" The result is a continuously fascinating display of theatrical wizardry that, largely because of inadequate acting, still falls short of what must be its principal goal: to make \"Show Boat\" as powerful for contemporary audiences as it was for those of the late 1920's and 30's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Theater in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/theater/theater-in-review-628993.html","abstract":"  Marriage Play  Signature Theater Company Kampo Cultural Center 31 Bond Street East Village Through Oct. 31  By Edward Albee; set by E.

If the effect of such scenes is disorienting, it ought to be, since this documentary consists entirely of excerpts from East German newsreels and educational material. Promoting everything from sex education for teen-agers to steamer cruises on the Volga, each of these snippets has its own blunt agenda. \"Show us where children are not so well off,\" a teacher asks a student, spinning a globe. \"Yes! Where capitalism dominates! A good answer.\"   Using no narration, interruptions or other means of breaking the spell, Wolfgang Kissel has strung together a riveting series of vignettes, each of them intended to sway the audience in what now seem laughably clumsy ways. Despite the dated, unbecoming light in which they now appear, though, these scenes are ultimately too sad and serious to play like anything out of \"Reefer Madness.\" Spanning 40 years' worth of East German history, \"Strictly Propaganda\" documents endless deceptions, variously large or insignificant, that add up to a national tragedy. Mr. Kissel makes his film all the more disturbing by never stopping to contrast real events with their absurdly sunny, inspirational counterparts on screen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931020","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/20/nyregion/bridge-052393.html","abstract":"  If your partner opens the bidding and the opponents reach a game, it is reasonable to assume that you can afford to double holding five trumps headed by the ace and a side king.

One panelist compared American theater in the 20's to the stock market, \"a joy ride\" destined to crash.   In her keynote speech, the director Anne Bogart commented on the astonishing productivity of Broadway, where in 1927 alone there were 268 openings covered by critics from the 24 New York City daily newspapers. While recognizing the contribution of musical theater, she was quick to add that it was paralleled by experimentation in drama: Eugene O'Neill and Sophie Treadwell shared a spotlight with Rodgers and Hart.

The President has proposed a complicated set of regulations to limit the rate in increase in health care spending to the inflation rate. Among other things, these regulations would limit the amount that health insurance premiums could rise each year. Many health care providers are concerned that the limits would adversely affect the quality of care and that some health care plans might actually run out of money. The President's proposal also calls for each state to set up contingency funds to bail out insolvent plans. SCORECARD: The ad purports to reflect the concerns of average citizens, and it effectively appeals to a generalized sense that the Clinton Administration's plan doesn't quite add up. But the ad has an melodramatic, overacted quality that may make viewers suspicious. And once they learn the ad is sponsored by the insurance industry, these suspicions are only likely to increase.

The selections at C&M Arts are also drip paintings, and also great, but they are relatively small, executed for the most part on paper measuring no more than 22 by 30 inches.

Land mines have turned large areas of the world into a permanent no man's land.

But he had to wait until he was in his late 60's, after 20 years of virtual retirement, before he found the audience that had slipped through his fingers earlier. He was lured back to performing in the early 90's by the encouragement of fellow singers like Ruth Brown, who had also gone through a period of rejection after early success. He made a widely acclaimed debut at the Supper Club last spring, and is back for an engagement through Nov. 20. His shows are at 8 and 10 P.M. tonight and tomorrow night.

The air smells of smoke and sugar and chilies and garlic, and the whole atmosphere is so inviting that you are irresistibly drawn into the center of the room.   Why hasn't Korean food become more popular in New York City? This is a puzzle because of all the Asian cuisines, Korean is most accessible to the American palate. Long ago we rose above our distrust of garlic and began our continuing romance with Chinese cooking. Then we overcame our fear of raw fish and learned to love Japanese. When Thai food came along, it seduced half the country. But most of us have yet to discover Korean cooking, which offers a great many things we already love (beef, barbecue, the opportunity to graze) and presents very few obstacles.

For his investment, Mr. Spielberg is assured a first look at the play as a potential film property. That is, his production company, Amblin Entertainment, will have a chance to bid on each play's film rights.    If Amblin does make the film, the playwright is assured the assignment of writing the first and second drafts of the screenplay, and in addition, Playwrights Horizons will be involved, as associate producers, in the production, contributing to the creative development of the project and, just as important, participating in the profits.
