It is pop's job to carry that music -- or at least its most accessible efforts -- from the periphery to the broader public.    Starting on Tuesday, bands from all over the United States converge on New York City, hoping to be heard by taste makers and music moguls in town for the New Music Seminar.

IDENTITY: Fashion designer, unwilling progenitor of the \"new glamour\" movement.  AGE: 38. HOME: Vienna. CAREER: Began designing his own collection in Vienna in 1980, and showed in Paris for the first time in 1986. Since then, he has been developing what he calls a non-referential view of fashion: one that does not look back. His clothes typically use high-tech fabrics and clean tailoring, but with a rock-and-roll edge. In the last year, the Lang influence has been inescapable in glossy magazines and on other designers' runways: satiny and silky sheens, deft touches of glitter, simple silhouettes. Fashion insiders are calling it \"the new glamour.\" He wishes they wouldn't. Q.  Why are there so many Helmut Lang rip-offs this season?  A.  I give that question back to you. That's your role in this industry, to define this kind of movement; it's not mine. I'm just doing it.  Q.  You don't like people using past references to describe your style. Why? A.  Because the past has nothing to do with it. It's all about today. We all know there is a history, and we all have our own history and past. There can be some references, but you can't always compare everything using the same old images and the same feelings. I think the history and the past we have is just an energy we've built up to do what we do now.  Q.  Your success has come from a steady evolution of your style. Does fashion try to change too much each season?  A: If something is good, it doesn't go out of style every six months. The fashion wheel of today doesn't have to go as quickly as it was pushed in the 80's. Q.  Culturally, why do you think this \"new glamour\" movement is happening now? A.  Simplicity, deconstruction, was what we had the moment before glamour, and it was celebrated like a religion. That caused the change. It's never good to exaggerate a movement. When that happens with glamour, when it's overexaggerated, we'll go quickly to something else.  Q.  How is this glamour different from yesterday's? A.  The difference is it's more mature. It's more mature than the glamour of the 80's, when it was important to be sun-tanned, before we knew what the sun could do to us. Today, it is being able to show you can play with sophistication. Q.  So, are designers forcing too much change? A.  I don't even think it's only the designers who influence it anymore. It's the media and what they promote to their readers. If there's one lipstick in your bathroom, you're out of fashion, or another, you're in fashion. We should have progressed much more at this point.  Q.  But obviously, since the new cry is \"glamour,\" you're profiting. How would you prefer to see magazines handle trends?  A.  The media is looking every season for a designer to tell a story. I have a long story I have to tell, continuing fluently year after year. I don't think I'm the one that invented glamour at all. I just built up my style year by year. I'm just lucky that the times are coming closer to what I do. But that wasn't the purpose of my work, to establish a new glamour. I do what I do. It has to do with my personality and my life, and I'm not thinking of what kind of provocation or sensation I want to make with my next collection. That wouldn't be a very good basis for a collection. I just try to do very honest, good clothes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Elizabeth Skinner, N. M.

But one leaves this book of black-and white landscapes, literary portraits, abstract-looking nudes and studies of English upper-class and lower-class life wondering just what makes Bill Brandt Bill Brandt. What links the man who in 1944 took a striking shot of an unhappy couple sitting at a pub with the man who in 1957 photographed an East Sussex landscape dominated by a large human ear? Why are the linkages in Brandt's work so unclear? A partial explanation is given in the introductory essay by the British art historian Ian Jeffries, who calls Brandt \"Britain's greatest photographer of the modern era.\" He says that many of Brandt's works, particularly those that appeared in his socialogical studies \"The English at Home\" and \"A Night in London,\" were intended as a series of photographs whose meaning depended on their juxtaposition -- a photograph of a coal miner at work was meant to go next to a shot of the coal miner's hard-bitten family at home without him. Even when Brandt (1904-83) was on assignment for magazines, Mr. Jeffries says, he often became \"engrossed or seduced by motifs.\" Here, one gets an occasional glimpse of Brandt's juxtapositions. There is, for instance, an eerie trio of photographs under the title \"The Magic Lantern of a Car's Headlights.\" But many of the photographs here are stripped from their intended context. That does not completely explain the uneasiness of this retrospective, though. The uncanniness of Brandt's art, as Mr. Jeffries points out, is the suggestion \"That what is ostensibly on show is not the whole story, that all those motifs are part of a larger, secret scheme, a private universe to which we are on the point of gaining access.\" SARAH BOXER","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Looking Back on the Art Of the Puppetmaster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/looking-back-on-the-art-of-the-puppetmaster.html","abstract":"SENSES are assaulted and assuaged with heraldic, brightly colored figures darting in every direction in \"Hidden Treasures: A Glimpse of Puppet Masterworks From the University of Connecticut,\" an exhibition at the William Benton Museum of Art at UConn in Storrs through Aug. 7.\n\nAlmost 300 marionettes, glove, rod and shadow puppets are in procession down the center of the gallery, poised on shelves and stages and dangling from walls.

We began by stopping at each cluster of rides and pavilions as we came to it, but by the end of our nine-hour day we were giddily crisscrossing the park.

The ones who do their 20 years in New York all want to be novelists. I'll go for that -- so long as they write with Ed Dee's drop-dead style and authenticity.   \"Mob grief was our specialty,\" brags Anthony Ryan, who works for the Organized Crime Control Bureau in Mr. Dee's punchy first novel, 14 PECK SLIP (Warner, $19.95). Ryan and his hot-dog partner, Joe Gregory, are staking out the Fulton Fish Market one filthy winter night in 1982 when they spot a barrel going into the East River. Recognizing a mob burial when they see one, they call for the boys in the wet suits. The divers bring up the wrong barrel but an interesting barrel just the same, because it holds the remains of Jinx Mulgrew, a bent cop who disappeared in 1972 before he could spill his guts about police corruption to the Knapp Commission. Ryan and Gregory jump all over this case, which spooks Jinx's crooked pals on the force as much as his old mob associates.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"A Life Dedicated to Saving the Cetaceans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/a-life-dedicated-to-saving-the-cetaceans.html","abstract":"  ROBBINS BARSTOW -- tall, razor thin and white bearded -- could pose for a painting of a captain of a 19th-century New England whaling ship hunting down the great creatures of the sea.

The first water slide, according to the World Waterpark Association, was built in 1971, when Dick Croul of Placerville, Calif., dug out a five-acre lake and shaped the pile of surplus dirt into a 350-foot Gunite-covered slide. Since that initial, rough attempt, water slides and the parks that contain them have become increasingly elaborate. In 1976 one of the first fiberglass slides appeared at Disney World's River Country. A year later Wet 'n Wild, considered the country's first full-scale water park -- and still billed as the most popular, with more than a million visitors a year -- opened in Orlando, Fla. Today, there are close to 500 water parks around the country, about 95 of them serving at least 100,000 thrill-seekers a year. Visitors to some of the most extensive and well-known parks -- including the 10 described below -- will find pirate ships, spidery spacecraft, yellow submarines and island refuges added to an already substantial assortment of wave pools, rivers, tunnels, waterfalls and 300-foot runs with 60-foot drops.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Distillation Of the Essence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/l-distillation-of-the-essence-689254.html","abstract":"  After reading \"An Ailing Author Shelves the Epilogue,\"  [ June 19 ]  I realize that it is possible to redefine one's self almost immediately.

Slippery Slopes -- four separate undulating slides, each 70 feet long -- are the tamest of the three major rides. Jessica and my wife, Susan, prefer Sesame Streak, which consists of three flumes, each 200 feet long; riders sit on inner tubes, twisting in and out of tunnels before splashing down in a pool. Runaway Rapids is a single 300-foot flume with lots of twists, turns and a bumpy bottom to simulate (vaguely) river rapids. Riders, on inner tubes, often end up going backward, which lends an out-of-control sensation as they speed through a steep tunnel and waterfall before the final splashdown.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Pinelands Plan Would Leave Critical Decisions to 3 Towns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/pinelands-plan-would-leave-critical-decisions-to-3-towns.html","abstract":"A DRAFT plan devised by an improbable coalition of developers, environmentalists and local officials and presented last week advances a broad effort to plot the future of the remaining 100,000 acres of pine barrens on eastern Long Island.\n\nAs a 90-day period for public comment begins, differing views among the drafters of the plan point to questions about protecting the 53,000-acre core area and the type of development in the surrounding so-called compatible-growth area of 47,000 acres.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"MUSIC;\n'Carmina Burana' and Its Lyrics of Young Love","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/music-carmina-burana-and-its-lyrics-of-young-love.html","abstract":"CARL ORFF'S \"Carmina Burana\" is a work whose appeal is universal, with \"tunes that stay in your head for weeks,\" said Zdenek Macal, who will conduct the work at the Garden State Arts Center on Wednesday at 8:30 P.M. \n\nOne of the most popular works for chorus and orchestra, \"Carmina Burana\" has a text drawn from a famous collection of 13th-century songs and poems, written mostly by minstrels and defrocked monks and discovered in the ancient Bavarian monastery of Benediktbeuren.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"War Stories","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/books/l-war-stories-663093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Glenn LaFantasie's very interesting essay \"Romance vs. Reality at Gettysburg: A Reconnaissance Report on the Books\" (June 12) failed to note the most original and thought-provoking book in the field, Kent Gramm's \"Gettysburg: A Meditation on War and Values,\" which was published earlier this year.

Monteux (1875-1964) was not the household name Toscanini was, partly because he hadn't the Italian's volcanic temperament and partly because between 1936 and 1952 (roughly Toscanini's tenure with the NBC Symphony in New York), Monteux was based in proud but provincial San Francisco.

It's true that in the city one worries about muggers, serial killers, and virus-borne exotic diseases. However, in the country there is one very large and inescapable worry. It's called the car. And even if your teen-ager doesn't drive, you can guarantee he or she will be riding in someone else's car -- for years. The majority of teen-age deaths come in auto accidents. Many more teen-agers are maimed or crippled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Geneva","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/travel/what-s-doing-in-geneva.html","abstract":"  Geneva, arguably Europe's most cosmopolitan city -- fully one-third of its 174,300 residents are foreigners -- is celebrating the tricentennial of Voltaire's birth. The French writer and philosopher spent the last 23 years of his long life in or near Geneva, as one of the many intellectuals who found refuge in what was then a nominally independent republic. A series of cultural events pays tribute to him this summer.   But Geneva's luminous months aren't all devoted to Voltaire. On Aug. 13, during the Fetes de Geneve (which run from Aug. 11 to 14), fireworks will light up Lake Geneva and the Jet d'Eau, the 475-foot landmark plume of water rising from it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Under Reeves, Giants Are Definitely Sporting a New Look","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/sports/pro-football-under-reeves-giants-are-definitely-sporting-a-new-look.html","abstract":"  It was mid-June and Giants Coach Dan Reeves had just told quarterback Phil Simms that his services were no longer needed.

The cutting of Simms and that scene could easily stand as a symbol for what the Giants have been through in the off season and where they are going. Free agency and a new salary-cap system have thrown the team into a tailspin and this Giants team, which will start training camp on Sunday, will be drastically different from the one that was only one step away from the conference title game last season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940717","headline":"Which Box to Check?

Some of the most interesting new music in Miami, though, comes from performers who have a foot in more than one camp. The Cuban-American singer and songwriter Nil Lara, who has made the Stephen Talkhouse club in Miami Beach his home base, is a prime example: here is someone as familiar with Led Zeppelin as with Beny More, who artfully blends rock and Latin elements into music both muscular and intelligent.

Once Germany was militarily dependent on NATO and deferred to American wishes; now the two cooperate as equals with common interests.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940718","headline":"DIALOGUE: Arsenals Abroad; Export Control For the 1990's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/opinion/dialogue-arsenals-abroad-export-control-for-the-1990-s.html","abstract":"  The United States' system for controlling sales of technology abroad was built in the cold war, a time when the U.S. and its allies dominated export markets and controlled critical technologies. That world no longer exists. As Congress begins debate this week on a new Export Administration Act to replace the one that expired in June, it has a chance to transform the system from a cold war relic into one that responds to the security needs and economic challenges of the 1990's.   The stakes are high. The Export Administration Act governs the export of \"dual use\" goods and technologies -- computers, telecommunications equipment, machine tools, electronics, aerospace products and other commercial items that can also have military applications. These are our most technologically advanced industries. They offer high-wage, high-skilled jobs. Growth in these job-creating sectors depends on exports. If export controls are poorly conceived, these sectors -- and U.S. competitiveness -- will suffer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940718","headline":"Comet Pummels Jupiter, Revealing Details","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/us/comet-pummels-jupiter-revealing-details.html","abstract":"  The titanic bombardment of Jupiter by a dying comet rained more mountain-size fragments on the giant planet yesterday, and new pockmarks and blemishes proliferated on its cloud-covered face.

Something of the sort is suggested by such late works as the Requiem, \"La Clemenza di Tito\" and the F-minor organ fantasia, although proto-Romantic pieces from the same period indicate otherwise. Mozart's Baroque interests were inspired by Baron Gottfried van Swieten, a knowledgeable music patron who worked to buttress the failing reputations of Bach and Handel late in the 18th century. Mozart made arrangements of several Handel works for the baron's Baroque concerts; the last of these, \"Ode for St. Cecilia's Day,\" was performed at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday as part of a Baroque-oriented week of Mostly Mozart.   Adapting the \"Ode\" for Classical forces, Mozart added some inner voices but did not actively re-compose; there is nothing unmistakably Mozartean. Instead, one hears a rather anonymous, high-gloss \"modernization,\" inferior but not detrimental to Handel's original. Gerard Schwarz led an enthusiastic, extroverted account, with broad, operatic vocal work by the tenor Gary Lakes and, commandingly, the soprano Christine Brewer (both singing in German, although not the translation printed in the program). What I missed were the \"sharp violins\" of John Dryden's poem, the exact, passionate articulation on which this music thrives. The same lack of clarity bedeviled Handel's Concerto Grosso in B minor (Op. 6, No. 12), first on the program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940718","headline":"Rioting Evokes Days of Arab Uprising","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/world/rioting-evokes-days-of-arab-uprising.html","abstract":"  It was a scene from the past: Sirens blaring, ambulances carrying scores of wounded to hospitals, hundreds of youths throwing stones at Israeli soldiers who shot back with bullets and tear gas at the edge of the Gaza Strip.

When the Okinawan group performed its first New York show on Sunday afternoon at the Central Park Summerstage, it demonstrated that corruption can be a good thing. The band didn't use Western instruments to imitate Western rock, but to further explore the music of its own culture. Because of this, Mr. Kina, considered the father of this hybrid Okinawan rock, has become a Bob Marley-like figure in the rest of Japan, where Okinawan music is considered exotic.    The group used a drum set, two electric guitars, a bank of synthesizers and a bass. The only visual difference between Champloose and other rock bands was the three women in bright, flowing robes who stood at the front of the stage. They sang in a nasal falsetto that set every dog in the vicinity howling, and they danced and drummed indefatigably throughout the concert. The women combined Okinawan tradition with the panache of 50's American girl groups.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Ailing Sampras to Take a Rest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/sports/sports-people-tennis-ailing-sampras-to-take-a-rest.html","abstract":"  PETE SAMPRAS withdrew from the Legg Mason Tennis Classic yesterday because of an injured left ankle and will not return until at least early next month.

Each was much more intense than the mere six-year dry spells that afflict modern California from time to time, new studies of past climates show. The findings suggest, in fact, that relatively wet periods like the 20th century have been the exception rather than the rule in California for at least the last 3,500 years, and that mega-droughts are likely to recur.   The evidence for the big droughts comes from an analysis of the trunks of trees that grew in the dry beds of lakes, swamps and rivers in and adjacent to the Sierra Nevada, but died when the droughts ended and the water levels rose. Immersion in water has preserved the trunks over the centuries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Observer; Good Heavens, Holmes!

Conducting is entirely a cumulative art, whose outstanding practitioners reveal their mastery over the long haul, not in virtuosic instants. An episode like Leonard Bernstein's famous overnight success with the New York Philharmonic is a glaring exception. Generally speaking, there are no conducting prodigies, and many talents rise to greatness only in old age. A night of good conducting is, after all, merely the average of a hundred musicians' efforts, and a great conducting career the average of many thousands of such nights.   So it is very difficult to draw conclusions from a single set of performances, as the distinguished jury of the American Symphony Orchestra's Stokowski Conducting Competition had to do at a finals concert on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall. Yet it was not a futile exercise. One conductor did clearly stand out from two other finalists, although not enough for the jury to award a first prize. Jan Wagner, originally of Austria and now based in Minnesota, won second prize, and Steven Zike and Sebrina Alfonso shared third prize. Such overnight ranking is risky, but we undeniably need some new way of detecting podium talent; the old European system, with its long apprenticeships in provincial outposts, no longer provides a dependable hierarchy through which good conductors can surface.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940719","headline":"Bank Regulator Says Clinton Sought Advice on S.& L.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/19/us/bank-regulator-says-clinton-sought-advice-on-s-l.html","abstract":"  President Clinton asked the nation's top bank regulator over the last New Year's holiday whether he could provide legal advice concerning the President's personal ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loan, according to an interagency memorandum written by the regulator.
