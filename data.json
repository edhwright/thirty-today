The eveninglong flashback to follow unfolds largely in the dank brick welfare housing of depressed northern England. The offstage band is small and tinny enough to hold forth in a garage. There is not much dancing, or, for that matter, much to dance about.   Which is just how Willy Russell, the author of the show's book, music and lyrics, wants it. First produced in London in 1983, \"Blood Brothers\" is a Thatcher-era attack on the British class system that wears its austerity on its sleeve, bourgeois frills be damned. Mr. Russell, the Liverpool-born author of \"Educating Rita\" and \"Shirley Valentine,\" would rather be sincere than slick. His musical has the rough-hewn proletarian flavor of British dramas of the angry-man era of the late 1950's and early 60's, and that authentic chips-with-everything spirit has been transferred to the snug Music Box Theater without any infusions of Broadway glitz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"Books of The Times; Peering Behind the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas Matter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/books/books-of-the-times-peering-behind-the-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-matter.html","abstract":"  The Real Anita Hill The Untold Story By David Brock 438 pages.

This impression is not entirely misleading. Mr. Brock's book is extremely damaging to Anita Hill's case.

Says It Placed Fatal Bomb; London Markets Rush to Reopen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/world/ira-says-it-placed-fatal-bomb-london-markets-rush-to-reopen.html","abstract":"  As officials scrambled to help banks and securities firms find temporary offices, the I.R.A. confirmed today that it had planted the deadly bomb that exploded Saturday in London's financial district.   Despite extensive damage to a number of buildings, officials expect financial markets to open Monday and to operate at nearly normal levels.    The bomb killed one person, wounded 44 others and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage when it went off in a parked truck in the heart of the City, as the financial district is known. Two Taxis Hijacked    Although the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility, its statement early today made no mention of two smaller bombs in London late Saturday night; they destroyed two taxicabs but caused no injuries.    The police said men with Irish accents tried to force the drivers of two cabs to drive them to their targets -- Prime Minister John Major's official residence at 10 Downing Street and Scotland Yard's headquarters -- but leaped out when the cabs were still far from their destinations. Both drivers fled before the bombs, which had been left in their cabs, went off.   If the bombings provoked one general reaction among the public, it was a sense that the Government and the police must step up their efforts against the I.R.A., which is waging a terrorist campaign to end British rule of Northern Ireland.   \"We are not getting results,\" said David Mellor, a former member of Mr. Major's Cabinet. \"The terrorists have ripped the heart out of the City of London, putting at risk lives, livelihoods and indeed the position of the City,\" he told the Press Association, a British news agency.  The Hunt for Clues    The explosion in the financial district left a 15-foot-wide crater in the street, shattered windows in dozens of buildings and sent shards raining down over several square blocks. Today the police continued a painstaking search for clues among the debris as officials sought to help banks, brokerage houses and other companies minimize the impact on their business.   \"The Prime Minister and I agreed that the best way to frustrate the terrorists is to have the City back at work tomorrow, and we are working hard to insure that it is,\" said Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor.   Thousands of workers will be unable to enter offices in the buildings that took the brunt of the blast, including the 52-story National Westminster Bank tower, which lost most of its windows, and the headquarters of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, whose lobby was destroyed. Most companies said that they were arranging for other office space and that they did not expect any major disruption. Estimating Losses    Initial estimates of the damage ran as high as $1.5 billion. But the Association of British Insurers said these estimates could prove highly inaccurate. The group noted that the initial assessment from a bomb explosion in the City a year ago, which caused extensive damage to the Baltic Exchange and nearby offices, was also $1.5 billion; the cost of repairs proved to be less than a third of that.   Some of the cost is expected to be borne by insurance companies and by the Lloyds of London insurance market. But much may fall to the Government, which agreed earlier this year to serve as an insurer of last resort for the many building owners who were finding it impossible or too expensive to get coverage against terrorism.   It was the most powerful explosion in London since an I.R.A. bomb went off in the area on April 10, 1992. Several I.R.A. attacks in recent months have been aimed at causing significant disruption as well as economic damage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/arts/dance-in-review-107593.html","abstract":"  Battery Dance Company  Gould Hall    As a choreographer, Jonathan Hollander picks fine music and creates tidy steps to it.

A combination of Government subsidies, industrial promotion plans and efforts by Nippon Steel itself, cushioned the blow and created jobs for many of the former steelworkers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"Ms. von Ferstel, Mr. Lobenthal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/style/weddings-ms-von-ferstel-mr-lobenthal.html","abstract":"  Alexandra von Ferstel, was married yesterday to Nicholas Ward Lobenthal, like her a lawyer in New York.

Four months of sterile arguments over Israel's deportation of 400 Hamas militants offer little encouragement on that score. Yet behind-the-scenes diplomacy orchestrated by the Clinton Administration gives some reason for hope.    Taking over from an Administration that got the peace process off to a brilliant start, but then seemed to lose its focus, the Clinton team made reviving the talks a top foreign policy priority.

As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms heavier than Endeavour.

Methadone treatment programs were pioneered in New York City 30 years ago and have now been evaluated around the world.   They invariably show a dramatic reduction of illicit drug use and associated antisocial behavior. They also appear to reduce the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. So effective is this treatment that most physicians consider it to be unethical to offer double-blind research trials without methadone in both groups.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930427","headline":"Talking About the Riots That Tore Los Angeles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/movies/talking-about-the-riots-that-tore-los-angeles.html","abstract":"  Even after so many showings, the pictures of last year's Los Angeles riots, like those of the beating of Rodney G.

During Ms. Redgrave's childhood, her parents were often absent, away on tour or, in the case of her father, at home working obsessively on his next role. The paternal slights were many, beginning with the fact that Redgrave failed to mention Lynn's birth in his journal. More attention was paid to her outgoing older siblings Vanessa and Corin.

He and Dr. Mi-Hua Tao, who now works at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Taiwan, fused a molecule of immunoglobulin, a weak immunogen produced by the host's malignant B cells, with a drug called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or GM-CSF. The drug is used to stimulate regrowth of the bone marrow in marrow-transplant patients and also enhances the body's ability to recognize antigens.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930427","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/27/nyregion/no-headline-189093.html","abstract":"  \"One of the most important stops on the organ is the room.

He topped one of the strongest fields in an American tourney by scoring 6 1/2-2 1/2 in the 10-man invitational event and was awarded the $2,000 first prize.   Grigory Kaidanov, a Russian emigre who lives in Lexington, Ky., took second place with 6-3.

Indeed, he was the early leader until he lost to Benjamin with two rounds to go. Here is an example of his powerful attacking play, against the Maryland international master Alexander Sherzer in Round 2 on April 14. Sherzer's chief comment was, \"I confronted him with a new move, but he discovered a strong plan against it.\"    The Aberbakh Attack against the King's Indian Defense, 5 Be2 and 6 Bg5, prevents 6 . . . e5 in view of 7 de de 8 Qd8 Rd8 9 Nd5, which wins material. It also retards the development of the white KN to keep the way clear for supporting such thrusts as g4 or h4.   If Black omits 6 . . . h6, as Sherzer does in this game, then, after 6 . . . c5 7 d5 e6 8 Qd2, he is no longer able to drive off the white QB, although he can still slip out of the pin with 8 . . . ed 9 ed Qb6.   Kaidanov's 11 Nh4 is the introduction to a formerly hotly disputed line of play that begins with 11 . . . Ne4 12 Ne4 Be4 13 f3. After 13 . . . Qb2 14 Rc1 Qd2 15 Kd2 Bd5 (15 . . . Bf5 16 Nf5 gf 17 Bd3 leaves Black in a poor endgame) 16 cd Re8 17 Rb1 Re5 18 f4 Rd5 19 Kc1 Nc6 20 Rb7 Rd4 21 Bf3 d5 22 Rd1 Rd1 23 Kd1, the consensus indicated by the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings, Vol. E, second edition is that White enjoys considerable advantage. For example, 23 . . . h6 24 Bd5 hg 25 Bf7 Kh7 26 Bg6 Kh6 27 fg Kg5 28 Rg7 will win for White.   Sherzer said: \"It was to avoid such trouble that I thought up 11 . . . Bg4. This move was not wrong. My mistakes came later.\" Kaidanov proceeded aggressively with 12 f3 Bc8 13 O-O-O!?   Sherzer said: \"The error was 17 . . . f5, opening my own king position. I should have played 17 . . . Ne5 at once.\" That way, on 18 h4, he would have been able to counterattack with 18 . . . Qb4 19 b3 b5 with reasonable chances of success.   Sherzer did indeed have counterattack in mind when he played 17 . . . f5 18 h4 fg 19 fg Ne5, but Kaidanov's attack with 20 h5! came more swiftly than he had reckoned on. After 20 . . . Rf2, Kaidanov charged to the attack with 21 hg!, ready to give up his knight with 21 . . . Rg2 to smash through with 22 Qh6! hg 23 Qh8 Kf7 24 Rh7 Kf6 25 Qg7 Kg5 26 Qh6 Kf6 27 Ne4 mate.   Sherzer had relied on keeping his opponent tied down after 21 . . . Nc4, but Kaidanov sharply broke loose with 22 gh Kh8 23 Nh4!, threatening 24 Ng6 mate. Sherzer could not play 23 . . . Kh7 because of 24 Bd3, picking up a rook, so he tried 23 . . . Nh5. But after 24 Ng6 Kh7 25 Rh5 Kg8, Kaidanov produced the annihilating 26 Na4!   On 26 . . . Qb5, there would have followed 27 Qh6 Kf7 28 Qh7 Kf6 29 Qe7 Kg6 30 Rg5 Kh6 31 Qg7 mate. But also after 26 . . . Nd2 27 Nb6 Re2 28 Na8, Sherzer had no way of putting up a fight, 28 . . . Bg4 meaning nothing after 29 Rg5. Thus, he gave up.   In last week's column, the diagram should have shown the black king at h8 and a black pawn at f5.

The play had its acclaimed New York premiere a year ago at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. The director for television (stage director Christopher Ashley seems to have become a nonperson in the publicity credits) is George C. Wolfe, who is represented on Broadway with \"Jelly's Last Jam\" and, in previews, \"Angels in America.\"   Tapping into a journalistic vein that in literature goes back at least as far as John Dos Passos, the television version of Ms. Smith's one-woman show allows her to embody 19 characters, male and female, black and white, young and old, all of them caught up in the Crown Heights tragedy that left two people dead. The dialogue is taken verbatim from interviews conducted by Ms. Smith and, for an Angela Davis segment, Thulani Davis. The acting sections are framed in black-and-white photographs of the real events, overlaid with music ranging from black hip-hop to traditional Jewish chants. The production is striking.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930428","headline":"Shoemaker Hopes for Rare Derby Double Feat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/28/sports/horse-racing-derby-notebook-shoemaker-hopes-for-rare-derby-double-feat.html","abstract":"  Bill Shoemaker rode 8,833 winners during his 41 years as a jockey, and four of them were winners of the Kentucky Derby.

It got there, and onto lists across the country, not because of enthusiastic book reviews, heavy advertising or a major promotion campaign by the publisher.

For that average room, the tax would be about $24. For a $200-plus room in one of mid-Manhattan's upscale hotels, the tax for just one night approaches $50!

It takes about 19 hours for Valhalla and all its accumulated weight to come crashing down on our heads, but midway through \"Die Walkure\" time and pressure begin to work their restorative powers.   Wagner's various motifs become the listener's friends, assuming with each transformation a deepening personality. If in the end we are crushed by sheer reiteration, we are curiously renewed as well.
