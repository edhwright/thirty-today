The accusation appears to raise serious doubts about Mr. Hoffenberg's bid to purchase The New York Post, calling into question whether he will be considered a viable buyer of the nation's oldest daily newspaper. A1.  Prospective Post publisher says regulatory problems won't derail purchase of the paper. B3.  For some Tower investors of modest means, brokers inflated assets, the S.E.C. says. B3.  AIDS CURRICULUM IN DISPUTE AGAIN   New York State's top education official has ruled that the New York City Board of Education overstepped its authority and infringed on teachers' rights by requiring that all AIDS education stress abstinence as the most effective means of avoiding the disease. Thomas Sobol, the State Commissioner of Education, overturned a board resolution that he said established a \"stopwatch approach to education\" by dictating how and when teachers should teach about AIDS. A1.  FERNANDEZ MAKES APPEAL IN QUEENS   Schools Chancellor Fernandez is targeting Queens in his lobbying effort to change one vote on the New York City School Board and keep his job as the head of the country's largest school system. In a brief, closed-door meeting with the seven-member board, Mr. Fernandez responsed to a board critique of his leadership, part of a formal review of his performance. B2.  COLD AND FLU STRAIN CITY HOSPITALS   The recent frigid weather and an outbreak of the flu have put a strain on New York City's medical services -- overloading ambulances and some emergency rooms, and raising fears among hospital officials of a return to the gridlock of 1989 when waits for beds were as long as four days. B3.  REGION  NEW REALITIES IN CONNECTICUT  When Congress restored $2 billion last summer to the all-but-scuttled Seawolf submarine program at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Bill Sullivan immediately felt the blip. His General Motors dealership in nearby New London ended the year selling more cars than any year since 1987, but most of the sales were for used cars. Similar fault lines are everywhere in Groton, as the most Pentagon-dependent corner of the nation shudders and shakes toward a future after the cold war. In many ways it is a story of waiting for the worst. A1.  CLOSING ARGUMENTS IN GLEN RIDGE CASE   As the Glen Ridge, N.J., sex assault trial in Newark entered its final phases, the first of four defense lawyers began closing arguments by attacking the credibility of two of the state's expert witnesses and stressing inconsistent testimony about the mental capabilities of the mildly retarded woman at the heart of the case. B5.  A DINNER FIGHT, WITH A FEMINIST SLANT   A group of 20 prominent women in Norwalk, including the president of the League of Women Voters, is trying to put an end to what it believes is Connecticut's largest men-only function, the Norwalk Catholic Club's Lincoln Day dinner.

To Theocritus and Virgil, it was a place in Greece: rugged mountains surrounding mossy clearings and deep forests, where shepherds sang and made love but by all appearances never worked. For Marie Antoinette (before revolutionists decided to shorten her a little) Arcadia was a rural cottage a la mode, with milkmaids all in silk.   For two nights and a day on Friday and Saturday, Nicholas McGegan, four other musicians, two singers, two speakers and three lecturers told audiences at the Metropolitan Museum about another set of artistic daydreamers. Their patron was an expatriate Swedish Queen, and the organization -- founded in Rome in 1690 and consisting of musicians, poets, artists and thinkers -- called itself the Arcadian Academy. This is also the name of Mr. McGegan's five-person instrumental group.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930209","headline":"Review/Television; Not a Lot of Laughs: Blacks' Bumpy Road To Comic Stardom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/09/movies/review-television-not-a-lot-of-laughs-blacks-bumpy-road-to-comic-stardom.html","abstract":"  As far as television is concerned, Black History Month isn't likely to come up with a more irresistible treat than \"Mo' Funny: Black Comedy in America,\" a documentary having its premiere on Home Box Office tonight at 9:30.

Ogden Nash wrote:   Do you, my poppet, feel infirm?   You probably contain a germ.    Can one germ really make you sick?     A.  The number of microbes needed to make someone sick depends on the infective organism and varies greatly, said Dr. Robert Quackenbush, a bacteriologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.   \"The most infective is shigella,\" Dr. Quackenbush said. In some cases, only 1 or perhaps 1 to 10 bacteria would be enough to cause a form of dysentery called shigellosis, he said.    The disease germ, which is closely related to E. coli, a common bacterium in the gut, lurks in the feces of infected people and can be very easily spread. It is an increasing problem in institutions like day-care centers and nursing homes if hands are not washed religiously. Infected people should be cared for in isolation until their feces are found to be free of the causative bacteria, medical authorities say.    A rarer disease called Q fever is caused by an organism called Coxiella burnetti that is also infectious in fairly low numbers, Dr. Quackenbush said. It is often spread by dust contaminated by infected farm animals.    Dr. Quackenbush pointed out that certain strains of infective microbes are more virulent than others, even within the same species.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930209","headline":"Fernandez Gets State's Backing On AIDS Study","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/09/nyregion/fernandez-gets-state-s-backing-on-aids-study.html","abstract":"  New York State's top education official has ruled that the New York City Board of Education overstepped its authority and infringed on teachers' rights by requiring that all AIDS education stress abstinence as the most effective means of avoiding the disease.

Wood have never been insiders at the American Bar Association, one had to strain even to hear their names at the latest gathering of the bar group here this week.   Schedules for the gatherings are set months in advance, so nothing was on the formal agenda concerning President Clinton's tortured search for an Attorney General and the two women's roles in it. What talk there was of the Attorney General problem was confined to the corridors, and as the convention progressed, indignation seemed to yield to impatience. Problem Called 'Passe'    By Monday night, Caralee T. Neville, a trial judge from Minneapolis, was calling the imbroglio \"sort of passe.\" \"Everyone thinks it's time we just get someone in that office,\" she said at a reception in the Massachusetts Statehouse.   Gathering twice a year, with many smaller conclaves in between, the bar association is, in the words of Evan Davis, onetime counsel to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, \"a very family kind of organization.\"   It is a family, moreover, to which neither Ms. Baird nor Judge Wood has strong blood ties. Ms. Baird's only arguably memorable appearance here, for instance, came last summer, when she spoke on \"quality billing versus hourly billing.\"   All told, there were far more pockets of pity for Judge Wood who, everyone seemed to agree, earned far less and acted far more properly but was treated far more shabbily by the Clinton Administration than was Ms. Baird.   \"I was uneasy about Zoe Baird, because an Attorney General has to be cleaner than clean,\" said Barbara M. Mayden of New York, one of those who was still worked up over the subject. \"But what happened to Kimba Wood sent people reeling. It's like the Administration cut and run.\"   But bar members seemed far more sympathetic to Brooksley E. Born of Washington, the bar governor who was conspicuously passed over for Attorney General, than to either Ms. Baird or Judge Wood, who sits on the Federal District Court in New York.   And they talked as much about Jamie S. Gorelick, another Washington lawyer and bar association stalwart on the latest Clinton list, as of any of the also-rans. One lawyer called the 42-year-old Ms. Gorelick, who represents the District of Columbia Bar Association in the A.B.A.'s House of Delegates, \"Zoe with a green card.\"   If conversations on the topic were peculiarly passionless, they were also surprisingly diffuse. Quickly, they spilled over from the specifics of the two cases to the hazards of hiring undocumented help, the pitfalls of seeking public office in an age of poorly defined and ever-changing morality, and the clumsiness of the Administration and its own house counsel. Black Eye for Lawyers    Some people lamented what they deemed as yet another black eye for the legal profession. \"Here we are, a noble profession, that wants to be part of the Clinton effort, and yet here's our department, the    Justice    Department, and they can't find anybody clean enough to run it,\" said Llewelyn G. Pritchard of Seattle. \"Everyone they pick has some fatal flaw.\"   Robert N. Sayler, a Washington lawyer whose partner, Charles Ruff, also fell headlong on the issue of failing to pay Social Security taxes for a woman in his employ, called the experience \"terribly embarrassing.\"   \"I don't think it follows from the facts but the public thinks, 'We always said lawyers were sleazy, and this proves it two more times,' \" he said.    The drama also provided humorous campaign fodder for bar politicians. Campaigning for chairman of the House of Delegates, Hector Reichard Jr. of San Juan, P.R., assured bar members that he had never hired any illegal aliens from the United States mainland.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930210","headline":"No Cuts in City For Chauffeurs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/10/us/no-cuts-in-city-for-chauffeurs.html","abstract":"  With President Clinton's cuts in White House staff privileges, there will now be more chauffeur-driven cars for staff members at New York City Hall than at the White House.

Some scholars have argued that opera's evolution toward the age of Verdi and Wagner made Rossini feel increasingly out of date; but there are contrasting indications that the composer's agile intelligence became impatient with operatic conventions old and new.   \"Le Comte Ory,\" Rossini's farewell to comic opera, looks like an old-fashioned buffo romp at first glance, but it has hidden depths and peculiarities. Philip Gossett, America's foremost Rossini scholar, notes its \"sexual and musical shadows, disguises and illusions.\" The plot revolves around Ory's attempted seduction of a Countess whose husband is away at the Crusades; in the final trio, Ory, dressed as a nun, thinks he has embraced the Countess in the dark, only to find that it is his own manservant Isolier (sung by a mezzo-soprano). Avoiding the madcap setting that convention might have demanded, Rossini writes off-kilter and slitheringly chromatic music for this scene; order is restored in the martial finale, but an intriguing tone of decadence lingers.   These reflections are prompted by Tuesday night's smoothly idiomatic rendition of \"Le Comte Ory\" given in concert form by the Opera Francais de New York, at Gould Hall. Yves Abel, the company's director, gave the buffo episodes brilliance and bite, the lyric stretches a spacious eloquence. Since Mr. Abel founded the group in 1988, the Opera Francais has acquired a reputation as a fine independent company; for the most part, this performance did not frustrate expectations.   Jeffrey Francis, a tenor, took the title role's murderously broad range in stride; a nasal edge to his voice enhanced the antiheroic side of Ory's character, although toward the beginning his delivery should have been more seductively fluid. Lauren Flanigan, a soprano, sometimes seemed too powerful as the timid Countess, but her virtuosity drew shouts of praise from the audience. Kristine Jepson was an accomplished Isolier, singing with assurance high into her upper range.   The supporting cast had a couple of weaknesses: Joy Hermalyn did not provide enough contrasting delicacy as the Countess's companion, Ragonde, and the enthusiastic Jan Opalach had moments of wavering intonation as the tutor. But Philip Cokorinos, a bass-baritone, made the most of the opera's comic highlight, Raimbaud's drinking aria. Nathalie Morais, Paul D. Moore and Pierre Lorieau filled out the cast.    The orchestra played with energy and eloquence; there were some odd sounds from the string section, but the wind playing blended elegantly with the voices. The chorus propelled the action handsomely.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930211","headline":"Horse Racing: Notebook; Russ, Aboard 30-1 Shot, Gets Comeback Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/11/sports/horse-racing-notebook-russ-aboard-30-1-shot-gets-comeback-victory.html","abstract":"  Mary Russ, who took six years off from racing to be with her three children, returned last month at the age of 39 and resumed her riding career.

Mr. Kleinsinger, who will celebrate the 20th anniversary of his first Highlights in Jazz concert tonight with a show by the Count Basie Orchestra at the Downtown Theater of Pace University, was a jazz fan stuck right in the middle of jazz's greatest depression. Clubs around the city were folding, mainstream jazz seemed hopelessly traditional to taste-makers, and a new generation of expressionistic musicians had lost the older audience while rock had stolen younger potential listeners. And jazz concerts were a thing of the distant past.   So he decided to put one on.   \"I had gotten to be friends with Bucky Pizzarelli after spending time at Dick Gibson's jazz party in Colorado,\" Mr. Kleinsinger recalled the other day. \"He said to me: 'You know, you're really comfortable with musicians, and you really love the music. You should do a concert.' So I did.\"   The first show, featuring the saxophonists Zoot Sims and Al Cohn, the drummer Bobby Rosengarden, the trumpeter Joe Newman and Mr. Pizzarelli on guitar (Mr. Kleinsinger couldn't afford to rent a piano) was at the Theater de Lys, now the Lucille Lortel, on Christopher Street. The Daily News panned it (\"Jazz at de Lys a Cliched Thing\" ran the headline) and The New York Times praised it (\"Jazz Series Pilot Lifts Fans' Hopes\"). Mr. Kleinsinger never looked back, and 142 concerts later, roughly seven a year, he's still at it, producing the longest-running jazz series New York has ever seen. A Demographic Mix    From the start, he did something unusual. His concerts have been not only racially and sexually mixed, but have also featured performers of widely disparate ages. A typical show might have an octogenarian or two, at least one woman, perhaps a young musician from Germany (looking bewildered), and some be-boppers. Everyone plays \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" one of the octogenarians sings an obscure pop song and the audience leaves ecstatic.   The concerts are nearly always sold out, and if they aren't the extra tickets are donated to the Harlem School of the Arts and La Guardia High School for the Performing Arts. He has a base audience of 350 who come to every show, and 400 or so more tickets are quickly taken by the 5,000 or so people on his mailing list. Those who come aren't likely to be jazz club habitues. They're often older and have some nostalgic connection with the musicians performing.   \"It's a funny audience in that Doc Cheatham and Milt Hinton would be bigger draws than Wynton Marsalis and Ron Carter,\" Mr. Kleinsinger said. \"For the most part they're people who loved jazz when they were younger and prefer the older forms of jazz, including be-bop. They want to hear songs they know and they like the jam session format. They remember Jazz at the Philharmonic and clubs like Central Plaza, where they'd see guys sitting in.\"   Before and after each show and during the intermission, friends who haven't seen each other for a month hug or shake hands, and chat. The musicians amble around during intermission, and the audience greets them like old friends. 'Celebration of the Mainstream'    For Phil Schaap, a radio disk jockey who spent eight years working the sound system for Mr. Kleinsinger's concerts, each one is a joyful event.   \"It's a monthly celebration of the mainstream,\" he said. \"It's like a clubhouse meeting, and when the meetings are successful, which they always are, everybody reaffirms the deal. The club is Jazz New York and Jack has a chapter of it.\"   The concerts are a way into the past, providing a clue to how jazz used to function as pop culture. \"I'm aware that a lot of people come with a spouse or a date, somebody who isn't a jazz lover and has to be entertained,\" Mr. Kleinsinger said.    But there is nothing condescending about them, either. Mr. Kleinsinger knows which musicians still retain the ability to connect with an audience in a different way, one that mixes the excitement of musical virtuosity with charisma.   \"I was drawn to jazz because the musicians were larger-than-life figures like movies stars,\" he said. \"Satch and Dizzy and Lady Day and others were colorful, vibrant personalities. When you did meet them they rarely let you down. Zoot Sims was exactly how I thought he should be. People like Clark Terry, Dizzy, Milt Hinton, these are great human beings who are gifted entertainers and musicians, all extremely aware of the audience and what the audience needs and deserves.\" A Way of Growing Up    The interest in jazz came early to Mr. Kleinsinger, who at 56 is retired and teaches special courses in law and jazz to seventh graders at Intermediate School 52 in Inwood and spends one day a week working at the Parking Violations Bureau. His cousin, George Kleinsinger, was a composer who wrote \"Tubby the Tuba.\" Mr. Kleinsinger grew up in New York, and as a child he went to the Roxy, the Paramount, the Apollo and other theaters to hear the music.   \"I still have all the records I first bought,\" he said. \"The first one was a Red Norvo 78, featuring Vic Dickenson and Joe Thomas, two of my favorites. The first LP was 'Battle of the Bands,' on Capitol, with Dizzy, and Benny Carter and Charlie Barnett.\"   When he would find himself bored at Newport Jazz Festivals, he would sketch out perfect concert lineups.   The Highlights in Jazz concerts have featured Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, Milt Hinton, Doc Cheatham, Zoot Sims, Al Cohn, Lionel Hampton, Red Rodney, Dorothy Donegan, Roy Eldridge, Buddy Tate, James Moody, Jimmy Heath, Maxine Sullivan, Hank Jones, Dick Hyman, Marty Napoleon, Vic Dickenson, George Duvivier, Jon Faddis and hundreds of others.   Even when the shows sell out, Mr. Kleinsinger says, they do not pay for themselves. He manages to cover expenses with grant money from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts and by having jazz cruises, jazz brunches and just about anything else with the name jazz in the title.   \"Actually, the beauty of the system is that I don't make a living at it, that I have another means of support,\" Mr. Kleinsinger said. \"We finish in the black, but just barely, with $1,000 or so left over at the end of the year. The musicians play for way below their normal price, and I don't really pay anybody else. But everybody loves it, so I'm going to do it until the day I die.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930211","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/11/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-439793.html","abstract":"  Rosemary Clooney Rainbow and Stars 30 Rockefeller Plaza 65th Floor Through Feb. 27    One word that describes Rosemary Clooney at 64 is balance.
