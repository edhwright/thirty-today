In Texas, for example, the number of condemned inmates without lawyers has dropped in recent months to 46. But even those who have lawyers may be getting perfunctory representation at best, says Steve Hall, a spokesman for the federally financed Texas Resource Center, which recruits and assists private lawyers in death penalty cases.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941230","headline":"Tracing Human Behavior Back a Few Million Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/arts/tv-weekend-tracing-human-behavior-back-a-few-million-years.html","abstract":"  Desmond Morris, longtime observer of the species he calls \"The Naked Ape,\" begins \"The Human Animal,\" his new six-part series, with an hour on \"The Language of the Body.\" Going here and there around the world, the zoologist lights on the gestures people use for quarreling and socializing, buying and selling, and just gabbing.

(212) 924-9755. Big Time Sarah does everything a good-time blues belter has to do: she shouts, she rasps, she wails, she slings double-entendres and she gets the audience to join in. Her group, the B.T.S. Express, chugs along and smiles at her exuberance. Sets are at 10 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. Admission is $20. JON PARELES N.R.B.Q., Unpredictably    N.R.B.Q., Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Take the raucous twang of rocked-up rockabilly and splash on the tone clusters and manic piano pounding that link Jerry Lee Lewis to Sun Ra. Add to a seemingly bottomless repertory of well-known and obscure old songs, throw in some jovial pop originals by the band, and this results in N.R.B.Q., a band as unpredictable as it is seasoned. The Motorkings, led by Frank Funaro, formerly the Del-Lords' drummer, are to share the bill. Admission to the early show, at 9:30 P.M., is $30; the late show, at 1 A.M., is $25. J. P. Cypress Hill    Cypress Hill, Palladium, 126 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 473-7171. In Cypress Hill's singsong raps, characters spend half their time smoking pot, the rest shooting at people. As a spokesgroup for the legalization of marijuana, Cypress Hill makes the worst possible case for its cause. But its fans make a party out of irresponsible intentions and bad vibes. Doors open at 9 P.M.; tickets are $60 in advance, $75 at the door. J. P. God Street Wine    God Street Wine, Irving Plaza, Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Among the coterie of young bands rooted in the Grateful Dead's jamming, God Street has a few custom options: glimmers of progressive rock and reggae, an occasional rap and a post-hippie precision. Otherwise, the two-chord vamps just keep percolating along for the tie-dyed dancers. Tickets are $28.50 in advance, $33 on Saturday. J. P. Blues and Techno    Crystal Waters and Lords of Acid, Limelight, 660 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, (212) 807-7850). With her tart, unsentimental voice, Crystal Waters carries the corrosive rhythm-and-blues of Dinah Washington and Esther Phillips into the era of house music. Her lyrics aren't always simple exhortations to dance; her 1991 hit, \"Gypsy Woman,\" combined an irresistible \"la-da-dee, la-da-dah\" chorus with verses about a homeless woman. Lords of Acid, from Belgium, combine fast, propulsive techno music with lyrics about as many taboos as they can formulate. \"I want to talk to you about the forbidden pleasures of the flesh,\" a woman announces to open a single called \"The Crablouse.\" Doors open at 9 P.M.; Ms. Waters is to performs about 11:30 P.M., the Lords of Acid at 1:30 A.M. Tickets are $35 in advance, $50 at the door. J. P. Debbie Harry    Debbie Harry and the Lunachicks, Don Hill's, 511 Greenwich Street, at Spring Street, SoHo (212) 334-1390. Two generations of women's punk-rock. Debbie Harry, who led Blondie in the 1970's and early 80's, helped invent a cool, clear-headed, barbed pop that opened doors for performers as diverse as Madonna, the Go-Go's and Liz Phair. The Lunachicks are faster, sloppier and louder, sometimes angrier, sometimes funnier. Admission is $25. Doors open at 9 P.M.; the Lunachicks are to perform at 11:30 P.M. and Debbie Harry at 2 A.M. J. P. Funk and Social Issues    Milo Z., A.K.A., 77 West Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 673-7325. Milo Z. revives the plunging bass lines and wah-wah guitars of 1970's funk. While the music echoes Kool and the Gang and Parliament-Funkadelic, the lyrics take on social issues from interracial romance to gun control. Three sets to begin at 10 P.M.; $75 admission includes an open bar. J. P. JAZZ Vernon Reid and Masque    Vernon Reid and Masque, the Sun Ra Arkestra and Kehinde Ouhuru and the El Shabazz D'Jembe Orchestra, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, meat-packing district, (212) 229-0785. Masque is a new group led by Vernon Reid, the guitarist in Living Colour, who can blast out hard-rock riffs, zoom through blistering solos or jab and squiggle into realms of electric jazz. The Sun Ra Arkestra has lost its keyboardist and navigator, Sun Ra, but its longtime saxophonist, John Gilmore, leads one of the few big bands to embrace both Fletcher Henderson's swing arrangements and the open-ended possibilities of \"Space Is the Place.\" Doors open at 8 P.M.; music is to begin at 9 P.M. Tickets may be bought in advance for $20 by calling (212) 645-5189. Tickets are $25 at the door. J.

The room is dim, and the sultry air is perfumed with the mingled aromas of ginger, lemongrass and curry.

They also abandoned the fish-head soup. Clearly, June and Stanley Cheah had more in mind than just opening an ethnic restaurant in an upscale area of Manhattan. They seem to have edited their menu to introduce their country's little-known cuisine in the most appealing fashion. Penang is the opposite of those Chinatown restaurants where hopeful diners are invariably told \"You won't like that\" when they order exotic dishes.

Andrew Davis revived one of them on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, when he led the New York Philharmonic in a program that showed the kinship between Russian and French music. The musical accents are distinct, yet because Russian composers tended to look toward France rather than Germany for models, the music often shows traces of a French sensibility, particularly in matters of coloration and lyricism.   Mr. Davis showed that this influence was not a one-way street. The exoticism that drives Borodin's \"Polovtsian Dances\" is mirrored in a more sophisticated way in Ravel's \"Bolero,\" composed about half a century later.

Like most jokes, Black Velvet Flag gets less and less funny with each telling. The band plays sedate lounge-music versions of raucous punk-rock classics by California bands like the Germs, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks. Occasionally, the band tosses a few similarly anomalous original songs into their straight-faced performances. James Chance, on the other hand, is the real thing. A survivor of New York's noisy no-wave scene of the late 1970's, Mr. Chance continues to merge punk, funk and free jazz. While John Lurie, the star of several of Jim Jarmusch's films, is informed by punk and lounge music, he will probably be looking to avant-garde jazz and pop music for his smart, sometimes noisy saxophone playing during this rare solo performance. The show is to begin at 10 P.M.; tickets are $25 in advance and $30 on the day of the show, and include hors d'oeuvres, a Champagne toast and party favors. Reservations accepted for tables. NEIL STRAUSS Women and Men    Friggs and Jackass, Brownie's, 169 Avenue A, East Village, (212) 420-8392. This might be one of the only nights to see these two bands without getting jostled and nudged by myriad talent scouts looking to sign them to a record label. The Friggs are four women who play garage rock that hits as hard as surf music and swings as much as rockabilly. Jackass is a group of men who have an edge on other bands that play disaffected guitar grunge: its lead singer would look good on a magazine cover. Also appearing: Trickbabys, Clowns for Progress, and N.Y. Loose. The show is to begin at 8:30 P.M.; tickets are $10 in advance and $12 on the day of the show. N. S. Rocket From the Crypt    Rocket From the Crypt, Swingin' Neckbreakers and Portastatic, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Maxwell's capacity is probably less than that of a New Year's Eve party in a Manhattan studio, but if a sense of community and a strong, mixed-bag lineup of alternative rock is what you're looking for, then look no further. Rocket From the Crypt is a band from San Diego that mixes pop contrivances with punk-rock spontaneity, the Swingin' Neckbreakers play melodic, high-energy garage rock that seems untouched by any musical innovation since 1965 and Portastatic is the name for Mac McCaughan of Superchunk's side project, which plays pensive solo songs and slow-building group rockers. The show is to begin at 10:30 P.M.; admission is $25 and includes a buffet and Champagne toast. N. S. A 15-Hour Party    Heaven, at a location to be announced this afternoon, (212) 592-4444 or (212) 696-8939. Heaven, a huge rave being held in a warehouse that holds some 3,500 people, is the perfect place for partygoers who want to test their stamina. It begins at 9 P.M. on New Year's Eve and ends on noon the next day. The 15-hour party features live drummers, performances and the latest electronic dance music played by disk jockeys from around the world. The highlight of the night should be the set by Juan Atkins, a musician and disk jockey from Detroit who was a pioneer in techno dance music. Also to appear working the turntables are Doc Martin from Los Angeles, Paul Van Dyk from Berlin, Wild Child from London, Tiga from Montreal. For those who can still stand, the party is to move to another location after noon for more of the same. There will be no Champagne at Heaven, but there will be free whistles, flashlights and noisemakers. Tickets are $18 in advance and $22 tomorrow. N.

Mr. Giuliani's decision to cut the budget by such a large amount on his own -- the first step of such magnitude by a mayor -- comes a week after a state judge threw out both his initial budget proposal and an alternative version of cuts enacted by the Council.

Yet in the two years he occupied the director's suite, James Woolsey showed little sign that he could see beyond the cloistered world of an agency overtaken by history.   Mr. Woolsey's resignation this week was merely ratification of a fatal loss of Congressional and public trust over his handling of the Aldrich Ames case, the most serious betrayal of American intelligence secrets in the cold war. His gentle disciplining of officials who failed to detect or pursue Mr. Ames's mercenary work for Moscow, long before Mr. Woolsey's arrival, may have satisfied the C.I.A.'s internal standards of justice. But the letters of reprimand did not fit a case that exposed rot at the core of the agency, including lax security, clannish protection of colleagues and blindness to unfolding problems that should have led investigators to Mr. Ames years before he was caught.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"Cuomo Names 3 Supporters to State Board","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/nyregion/cuomo-names-3-supporters-to-state-board.html","abstract":"  In one of his final acts as Governor, Mario M.

His literary interests, his extensive writings on art and his activity as the editor of the influential series of translations \"The Documents of 20th-Century Art\" have all conspired to leave an image of an artist who was too intelligent for his own good. Abstract Expressionist painting was supposed to come from the gut, or so the cliche ran, while Motherwell painted with his head. Knoedler & Company has set out to dispel this image by presenting a selection of pictures from Motherwell's most successful series of paintings, \"Elegies to the Spanish Republic.\" Four large canvases devoted to this theme are accompanied by a closely related work, \"At Five in the Afternoon,\" and by a dozen smaller studies on paper and cardboard. The result is a triumphant vindication of Motherwell's pictorial talent.   One's first impression upon entering the gallery is that of a tremendous consistency, a consistency that does not become repetitive but adds to the cumulative impact of Motherwell's paintings. Although the series was begun in 1949, the earliest canvas here dates from 1958-60. It sets forth the basic elements of the series: a succession of broad black vertical bands, often rounded and curving at their bases, interspersed with black ovoids floating before a white background. The stark contrast of blacks and whites evokes the blinding sunlight and inky shade of a Spanish afternoon, while the semi-abstract black forms suggest a bull's sex organs, as E. C. Goosen, the art critic, pointed out in a 1959 article on Motherwell. (The sacrificial ritual of the bullfight and the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War were intimately linked in Motherwell's personal iconography.) The 1958-60 \"Elegy to the Spanish Republic\" is about 6 feet high and 8 feet wide. Executed in oil and charcoal, with obvious areas of reworking, it has a handmade, improvised feeling perfectly in keeping with the critic Harold Rosenberg's famous description of the canvas as an arena in which the artist was to act.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/arts/art-in-review-254150.html","abstract":"  Farrell Brickhouse  Pamela Auchincloss Gallery 558 Broadway (between Spring and Prince Streets) SoHo Through Jan. 14","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"Keep in Mind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/arts/keep-in-mind.html","abstract":"  FIRST NIGHT NEW YORK '95.

His famous masterpiece \"The Gross Clinic,\" a grisly if monumental portrait of Dr. Samuel David Gross presiding over a lecture and operation, so repelled the selection committee of the 1876 Centennial Exhibition that it was displayed not with other paintings, but among medical exhibits in a hospital.   In fact, while respected by a small circle of friends and artists and revered by his students, Eakins spent most of his career on the margins of the official art world, where he found himself after being dismissed from his prestigious post at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1886. At issue was his unstinting pursuit of anatomical accuracy: he insisted on using completely nude models in classes that included students of both sexes. His study of the body also included the taking of photographs of nudes for which he, his fellow teachers and his students posed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/style/chronicle-254215.html","abstract":"  EDWARD and BETTY SCRIPPS are so fond of their doctor, EDWARD C.

Elliott Sharp, a guitarist who is a fixture on the downtown experimental scene, is to lead a trio that will show his roots. From 9:30 P.M. to midnight, he is to play jazz standards; at midnight he is to start playing blues. A four-course dinner and a Champagne toast is $90. There's no cover at the bar. PETER WATROUS James Blood Ulmer    James Blood Ulmer and Defunct, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. This New Year's Eve is James Blood Ulmer's sixth at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes uses of drones and odd tunings, is distinct. It's hard-rocking, slippery music charged with power, except when he sings. Defunct is a hard funk-and-noise band that remembers the early 1980's. The sets start at 10 P.M. The $20 cover includes a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. JAZZ John Hicks   John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. John Hicks is an articulate, active pianist who always plays as if the present chorus is the last. He is to be backed by the bassist David Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis, which is an exceptional rhythm section. It is to be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show is to start at 9 P.M., and $115 buys a five-course dinner and Champagne. The cover without a meal is $25, with a $20 minimum. From 1 A.M. to 4 A.M., the cover is $20, with a $15 minimum. P. W. Michael White    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Michael White's New Year's shows are becoming a tradition, and they should be. This clarinetist leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's raucous, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the polyphonic group improvisations that bray and holler. The band invites listeners into a time warp and makes them understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. It traffics in joy. Sets are at 9:30, 11:30 and 1:30 P.M. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. P. W. Dennis Jeter Big Band    Dennis Jeter Big Band, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121.

The music will start at 10 P.M. and will not be stopping until after 2 A.M.; $150 a person includes a four-course dinner, a bottle of Champagne for each couple and a bagel buffet at 2 A.M. The $75 cover at the bar allows a listener to drink anything, all night long. P. W. Jimmy Witherspoon    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. One of the last of the great blues shouters is to treat an audience to classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which come with a blues nastiness to them. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and 1 A.M. There is a $25 cover charge and a $15 minimum, which will include party favors, at the appropriate moment. P. W. Big Band    George Gee, Metropolis, 31 Union Square West, at 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 675-0851. George Gee's big band is to be taking both upstairs and downstairs duty, playing for dancers and diners and cocktail drinkers. Upstairs, for $110, patrons receive a four-course dinner with unlimited Champagne, starting around 8 to 10 P.M. and staying all night. Downstairs, for $60, one can dance, drink at an open bar and eat hors d'whatevers, starting at 9:30 P.M. P. W. Saxophones and More    Gerry Gibbs, Ravi Coltrane, Mark Turner and John Swana, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 929-7565. The most intimate and relaxed jazz club in New York offers, for $30, food and drinks (no alcohol is served) and a group that includes two promising tenor saxophonists, Ravi Coltrane and Mark Turner. That is to start at 10 P.M.; at 4 A.M., Frank Hewitt on piano, Victor Gaskin on bass and Jimmy Lovelace on drums are to come on, and there's music, as usual, until 8 in the morning. P. W. Two Pianists    Hank Jones and Jacky Terrasson, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleeker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. A double bill of the smoothest pianist in jazz, Hank Jones, and this year's sensation, the pianist Jacky Terrasson. Mr. Jones is to be here with a group that includes the saxophonist Raph Moore and the trumpeter Tom Harrell; Mr. Terrasson is to be performing solo. The show is to start at 9 P.M. A full dinner, with Champagne and party favors, is $150. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $50 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Mance and Lightsey    Junior Mance and Kirk Lightsey, Cecil McBee and Marcus Belgrave, at Zinno's, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182.

LATIN Tito Puente   Tito Puente, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The percussionist and band leader Tito Puente is to spin his sticks over his head, dance a bit, stick out his tongue and egg his orchestra on to bigger and better music. He's a titan who understands the nexus between music and entertainment, and when he convenes a salsa orchestra, it's hard to find tougher dance music. The $175 package includes a five-course dinner starting at 8 P.M.; Champagne and breakfast at dawn; $90 includes appetizers, starting at 10:30 P.M., Champagne and breakfast; for $50, one can enjoy the music from 12:30 on until breakfast. P. W. On Broadway    Club Broadway, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-7600. For $20, one gets some of the better Latin dance music in the city, including the great Conjunto Clasico, the singer and whistler El Canario and the singers Ray Sepulveda and Tito Rodriguez Jr. It's a bill built for dancing, in a club perfect for dancing on a night made for dancing.

Who else would think to perform a furious riot girl version of \"The Ladies Who Lunch\" in the same set with a San Francisco reverie that includes a homage to Sylvester, the disco drag queen?

The club plans to feature a 45-foot video screen showing the activities in Times Square and three performers associated with the golden age of disco. France Joli, who is to go on at 11:30 P.M., was a one-hit wonder with her lush, dreamy disco ballad, \"Come to Me.\" Martha Wash, who is to go on at 1 A.M. scored her biggest hit, the humorous disco-gospel anthem \"It's Raining Men,\" with her group, the Weather Girls.

The stars of this promising triple bill are the younger generation's leading torch-bearers for old-fashioned pop-soul romance. Boyz II Men, the Philadelphia quartet that has led the revival of post-doo-wop harmony-group singing, has sold more than six million copies of its second album.

Sanborn and Schuur    David Sanborn and Diane Schuur, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The most popular saxophonist after Kenny G, David Sanborn makes appealingly soulful music that begins with a rhythm-and-blues base and ripples out to embrace elements of world music and jazz-fusion without settling into the snoozy formulas that have given electric jazz a bad name. Ms. Schuur is a technical powerhouse of a singer whose style suggests a more formalized Ella Fitzgerald inflected with Kate Smith's clangy brightness.

Like an apparition from a 1930's movie musical, Tommy Tune is to strut down the staircase of the Rainbow Room at 11 P.M. and perform with a swing band led by Michael Andrews. The evening, which includes dancing to Mr. Andrews's orchestra, includes a seven-course dinner and costs $375 a person, not including beverages, tax and gratuities. Down the hall at the Rainbow and Stars cabaret, Maureen McGovern, the most vocally disciplined and technically resourceful of New York cabaret singers, is to perform her new show, \"My Reel Romance With the Movies,\" a program of classic movie songs, at 11 P.M. High points are medleys of songs by Henry Mancini and Harold Arlen. The evening, which includes a seven-course dinner, costs $325 a person. In a more rock-and-roll vein, holding forth at the Rainbow Pavilion after 11 P.M. are to be the Impalas, the vocal group best remembered for its 1959 hit, \"Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home).\" Dance music is provided by Uptown, an eight-member jazz band. The evening includes a seven-course dinner and costs $325 a person. The Promenade Bar will be open from 9 P.M. on and costs $50 a person. At midnight, Rainbow's Fellini Fantasy Parade, a conga line, is to make its way across the complex. No matter which room you choose, the setting offers the essence of Manhattan glamour. S. H. Mary Cleere Haran    Mary Cleere Haran, Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947. Mary Cleere Haran is something like a 90's Doris Day, but hipper and jazzier, with a feminist sensibility and an intellectual take on pop nostalgia. She is to perform her acclaimed show of 1950's movie songs, in which gorgeous renditions of songs like \"An Affair to Remember\" are accompanied by witty, sometimes barbed commentary on the Eisenhower era. Shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M., and there are two dinner seatings, at 8 and 10:30 P.M. There is a $45 music cover charge and a $30 food and beverage minimum. S. H. Weslia Whitfield    Weslia Whitfield, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan; reservations: (212) 840-6800, extension 154. Weslia Whitfield, the San Francisco cabaret singer who is almost a regular fixture at the Algonquin, combines an impeccable taste in classic pop songs with a homey, low-key delivery that is discreetly flavored with jazz. The 9 P.M. show is sold out. The 10:30 P.M. show includes an 8:30 dinner seating and costs $190 a person. S. H. COMEDY Looking for Laughs   Comedy at Caroline's, 1626 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 757-4100. Heading the New Year's Eve bill at New York's leading comedy club is to be Dave Attell, a balding 30-year-old comic from New York whose who wears ripped jeans and a jean jacket and delivers a barrage of sarcastic topical jokes. Four other rising comics are to join him on the bill: Jim David, Linda Smith, Greg Giraldo and John Henson. There are two shows: an 8 P.M. dinner package at $65 a person and a 10:30 P.M. countdown celebration (with dinner) for $110 a person. Reservations required. S.

Even the introduction of a designer collection for the next season has moved from the intimacy of a manufacturer's showroom to a tent or an amphitheater seating thousands. The cut or the fabric of an outfit is hardly the selling point, since the details cannot be seen beyond the first few rows. The music, the choreography and the lighting supersede the clothes. The mood is that of a Broadway musical.   Those who assemble fashion exhibitions feel similarly compelled to put on the glitz. It is therefore somewhat astonishing to come upon a small, modest, straightforward presentation of clothes by Claire McCardell, this country's finest designer, at the Parsons School of Design's exhibition center in Greenwich Village. The clothes have not been gussied up. They emit an air of reality, as if real people can wear them as they go about their daily lives. What is most astonishing is the fact that most of the styles are more than 40 years old. McCardell died in 1958 at the age of 53.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941230","headline":"HORSE RACING;\nN.Y.R.A. to Jockeys: Ride or Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/sports/horse-racing-nyra-to-jockeys-ride-or-go.html","abstract":"The New York Racing Association has told jockeys at Aqueduct that they would not be allowed on track grounds if they choose not to ride on Sunday, the first day many leading riders are expected to decline mounts because of a nationwide dispute over insurance coverage.\n\nA nationwide walkout seems inevitable because negotiations between the Jockeys' Guild and the Thoroughbred Racing Associations are at a standstill.

If the new state rule withstands court challenges, it will mean the city can legally leave families to sleep for two nights or more on the tables, chairs and floors of city offices while they wait for shelter. In the last four years, the city has routinely failed to place thousands of families as quickly as the state required, and as a result, state courts have fined it more than $5 million. Page 1.

Decisions to improve dangerous roadways or intersections, for example, or to increase an area's anti-drunken-driving patrol often grow out of trends revealed by accident statistics. And officials of four state agencies acknowledge that in New Jersey these statistics are often inaccurate, confusing and outdated by the time they reach the public.   Some of New Jersey's accident statistics of the last five years rise or fall by an implausible 30 percent or more each year, depending on which state or Federal agency is reporting them.

It was begun in 1937 by the remarkable Anne O'Hare McCormick and was originally called \"In Europe.\" In those days \"In Europe\" was foreign affairs for most Americans, and it seemed perfectly natural that the paper's one overseas columnist was rooted on the European Continent. Mrs. McCormick's 1954 obituary in The Times said she got her start in foreign reporting \"as the wife of Mr. McCormick, a Dayton engineer whom she accompanied on frequent buying trips to Europe.\"    Obviously, I was born in a very different era, one in which columnists only have to accompany their curiosity and engineers travel to Tokyo for buying trips, not Paris. Both factors have led me to start my column from Japan. While I have no intention of calling my column \"In Asia,\" the thought did cross my mind. Let's face it, when the history of the late 20th century is written, the most important event may not be the reconstruction of Europe, the cold war or the collapse of Communism, but rather the rapid modernization in one generation of two billion people from Japan to the border of India. Never have so many raised their standard of living so far so fast.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"The Hockey Lockout Affects More Than Just the Players","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/nyregion/the-hockey-lockout-affects-more-than-just-the-players.html","abstract":"PATTI E.

So, on a mild winter's afternoon, strollers can pause for a rest and enjoy the sight of boats in the bay. Three weekends ago they would even have seen sunbathers playing cards on the wide beach.   But since this is Cannes, watching the show along La Croisette has long been thought more interesting. For the best view, most people turn their backs to the sun, sea and sand. After all, during the Cannes Film Festival every May, there are starlets to be gawked at. In the summer, the young and beautiful show off their bodies. And in winter, elderly promenaders offer fashion, elegance and pampered little dogs as entertainment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Doctors' Accounts Vary In Death of Libby Zion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/nyregion/doctors-accounts-vary-in-death-of-libby-zion.html","abstract":"  When Dr. Gregg Stone resumes testifying on Tuesday in the wrongful-death lawsuit brought by Sidney Zion against New York Hospital, he will be trying to bolster the defense's side even as he contradicts a co-defendant's account.

We post-moderns are by now so far from the modernist repudiation of Victorian influence that we can look with an unembarrassed eye -- an eye of one's own, we might say -- at the three-decker Victorian novel's subplots and coincidences, its bloated serializations, its unnaturally heightened and speechifying dialogue. We can see past their potboiler mechanisms into what these baggy old novelists humanly, and sometimes half-divinely, knew.\n\nAnthony Trollope has long been excluded from this percipient, and undeceived, reassessment. He is nearly the only Victorian novelist who has been critically doomed to remain a Victorian. He alone appears to be unforgiven. Dickens and Henry James and George Eliot and Thackeray -- even the colonialist-imperialist Kipling! -- are permitted, and sometimes prodded, to transcend the accident of their chronology and the confines of their mores. Only Trollope is regarded as still mired in his devices -- devices that are, in their pre-video yet cinematic way, archetypes of our present-day story-machines, glowing like colored apothecary globes in rooms where pianos used to stand. Trollope, in brief, is dismissed as a kind of antiquated television set; he is said to be \"undemanding.\" Dickens, by contrast, survives in all his greatness as caricaturist; George Eliot as moralist; Thackeray as ironist; Hardy as determinist.

Niched with no fuss whatever in what was a communal apartment high in the annex of the former Sheremetyev Palace in St. Petersburg, it is devoted to a great Russian poet, Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966). A quiet and almost secret place, it has in it virtually no object of intrinsic value. Its installation is rudimentary. But it is her own room, with her belongings all around, nothing added or subtracted. The linden trees outside the window are the ones whose agitated shadows she remembered in times of trouble. How could her presence not be felt to an almost overwhelming degree?   From 1925 to 1952, it was the nearest thing to a permanent home she had. Here between 1935 and 1940 she composed \"Requiem,\" a sequence of poems from which posterity will know what it was to be in St. Petersburg during the Stalinist terror and to live in dread from day to day. And in this apartment she later wrote much of the long \"Poem Without a Hero,\" a phantasmagorical and often cryptic or coded autobiography into which people, places and incidents from her past come crowding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Smoke-Free Flights Increase","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/travel/practical-traveler-smoke-free-flights-increase.html","abstract":"  SMOKE-FREE flying suddenly looks a lot more real.

The election of Bill Clinton in 1992 seemed a declaration that Americans wanted a government that lifted the needy instead of punishing them.    But as 1995 dawns, a new band of hard-talking officeholders and social engineers has created a compassion crisis in American political life. Their political energy flows in part from the well-crafted fiction, originally promulgated under President Reagan, that the wealthy are embattled.

The year will also provide the occasion for a thorough reappraisal of British music, which is timely, for the reputation of British music abroad is not wholly positive. The stigma bestowed by the contemptuous dismissal of pastoral English music from the start of this century as \"cowpat school\" (a phrase reputedly coined by one of the few British composers with strong Schoen bergian leanings, Elisabeth Lutyens) has stuck, and British composers are too often seen as backward-looking, provincial and out of touch, plodding around in the fields while the rest of the world streams down the highway.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"Sex and Violence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/movies/l-disclosure-sex-and-violence-211095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I enjoyed the article on \"Disclosure\" and thought it made interesting points about the relationship between female sexuality, male fear and power.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"How Two Pianists Remade (And Upheld) a Tradition","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/arts/jazz-view-how-two-pianists-remade-and-upheld-a-tradition.html","abstract":"  TRULY INNOVATIVE ARTISTS IN a given form clarify the questions that the form itself seems to be asking at the moment the innovators come along.

Yet the tension between their sensibilities makes their common esthetic concerns stand out in bolder relief than they might otherwise have.   Such a pair were the pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, who together in the 1940's staked out the playing field for their instrument in what was known as modern jazz. In styles as different as Goya's was from Manet's, Powell, who died at 41 in 1966, and Monk, who died at 64 in 1982, re-evaluated the piano's relation to its European heritage and reached nearly opposite conclusions.

Its residents hungering for order, the civic life of New York's neighborhoods evolved as both prickly and aggressive, amounting to a stiffening of civic resolve that sought control over the streets and an erasure of the decades-old impulse of shrugging off disorder. Hearts hardened; community meetings often turned ugly.   Feeding off new commercial life swelling in neighborhoods from SoHo to the Upper West Side, Manhattan had a crisper feel, perhaps caffeinated by the new-style coffee bars that cropped up on some streets three at a time. Huge stores took over the empty hulks that were the dreams of turn-of the-century retailers. Themes and hooks were demanded, and the rollicking permutations of capitalism sometimes took bizarre forms. Televisions turned up above urinals in restaurants. One nightclub owner decided to have an earthquake night: the place shook at midnight as Los Angeles video imagery abounded. When the venture failed, he tried a Latin American earthquake and the imagery turned Cuban.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950101","headline":"A Bit of Mongolia in Oregon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/travel/a-bit-of-mongolia-in-oregon.html","abstract":"FOR some strange reason, the yurts along the Oregon coast were not booked up for Thanksgiving Day.

Neil A. Grauer, a freelance journalist and cartoonist, has provided the best to date: an appreciative, sympathetic overview of a singular talent and the often compromised life it inhabited. Neither a literary adulation (like Charles S. Holmes's biography, \"The Clocks of Columbus\") nor an irritable diminishment (like Burton Bernstein's \"Thurber: A Biography\"), REMEMBER LAUGHTER: A Life of James Thurber (University of Nebraska, $20) manages to offer a writer's life with a balance that is often lost in contemporary biography. Expedient, germane and selective, the book maintains an interest in the subject's personal life and development only to illuminate Thurber's work, which is what warranted the biography in the first place. Though Mr. Grauer necessarily relies on previous criticism, Thurber's letters and interviews with the author's few remaining associates (most of whom, alas, knew Thurber in his last two decades, when alcohol often inspired more diatribe than humor), his own opinions allow for both circumspection and conviction. Mr. Grauer fairly inventories the sources for Thurber's uncanny fictionalized memoirs as well as his later \"grumpy and misanthropic\" tone when he assumed \"the role of a nearly perpetual pallbearer for comedy.\" Throughout, Mr. Grauer does not permit a demeaning anecdote to displace the genuine accomplishments that continue to provide the greater perspective. \"Remember Laughter\" takes its title to heart, which should give readers a reason to celebrate.\nMICHAEL J.
