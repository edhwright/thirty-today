Fujimori might have been expected to cringe at the sight of his wife starting a sidewalk hunger strike against the Government. But he took the news in stride on Wednesday. He ordered his health minister to send an ambulance. Then, he sat down for lunch.   That evening, television news programs first showed the President, eating seafood washed down with white wine, seated at a cloth-covered banquet table. Then, viewers saw his wife, Susana Higuchi, being rushed to a hospital after fainting in the summer heat from dehydration and hunger.   \"It's quite dramatic,\" mused Augusto Alvarez Rodrich, a pollster here. \"Six months ago, she was in the Presidential Palace, now she's fainting on a sidewalk. But at the end of the day, I don't think it will cost Fujimori many votes.\"   Mr. Fujimori seems to be weathering an unrelenting six-month assault by his worst political enemy, his wife of 20 years.   Opinion polls routinely show Mr. Fujimori favored by about 45 percent of voters, more than the sum of the 12 other candidates, including his closest rival, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations Secretary General. Today, Peru's major electoral mystery revolves around whether Mr. Fujimori will be re-elected in the first round of voting on April 9 or in a June run-off.   But in a new twist for Peru's traditionally messy electoral politics, the President's wife is doing her best to make sure that his first term is his last.   Using Peru's radio, television, newspapers and magazines to wash the Presidential palace's dirty laundry in public, Ms. Higuchi over the last six months has accused her husband of having a mistress, lying to the public, being heartless to the poor, tolerating official corruption, being a dictator, locking her out of the palace, preventing her from seeing their four teen-age children, sabotaging her political aspirations, and plotting to kidnap her.   \"It appears that the intention was to put me in a cellar -- then goodbye Susana,\" the diminutive, 44-year-old civil engineer and businesswoman told reporters.   Just before Christmas, she filed for divorce, and then told reporters that her husband, a self-described Catholic, was really an agnostic.   Through it all, the 56-year-old Mr. Fujimori, an iron-willed figure who in four years has broken the backs of hyperinflation and of the Shining Path guerrilla movement, has smiled, albeit thinly, knowing that his public approval rating has not budged much since July, hovering around 65 percent.   \"Fujimori's relationship with the people is similar to Ronald Reagan's,\" said Mr. Alvarez Rodrich, who directs Apoyo, the nation's leading polling group. \"He comes under heavy criticism. But in the end people support him. Perez de Cuellar has yet to explain, in simple language: Why bother to change a President who in the eyes of the public is successful?\"   In addition to smashing the Shining Path, Mr. Fujimori has slashed inflation, from 7,000 percent in 1990 to 15 percent last year, sparking an economic boom that has given Peru the fastest-growing economy in North or South America for the last two years.   Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a patrician career diplomat who turned 75 today, seems to lack the common touch on the campaign trail and draws only small crowds. His coalition, Union for Peru, is a lightning rod for a diverse group of opponents to Mr. Fujimori: Socialists, retired army officers, Indians, Protestants and union leaders.   After three months of the campaign, no candidate has seriously dented Mr. Fujimori's support, despite opposition charges that the Peruvian Government is bankrolling Mr. Fujimori's reelection campaign.    Two weeks ago, Peru's Congress, controlled by Fujimori supporters, passed a watered-down election law that bars the President from making campaign speeches while he inaugurates public works projects.   With public works a key source of political patronage, Lima's Mayor, Ricardo Belmont, decided last year to run for president on a ticket called Obras, or Public Works. Sensing a threat, Mr. Fujimori promptly cut $22 million in federal funds from Lima's city budget, forcing the Mayor to cancel 14 major public works projects. Once a popular figure, Mr. Belmont now runs fourth in the polls, winning 3 percent of voter preferences.   Bristling at the complaints, the National Electoral Board vows that the general elections in April will be fair. Responding to an opposition complaint, the board last month invalidated about 14,000 voter identity cards that were illegally issued to army and police officers.   At every turn, Mr. Fujimori and his supporters have sought to stifle Ms. Higuchi's own political aspirations. Last July, Peru's Congress approved what is widely called \"the Susana law,\" barring the spouse or blood relative of a Peruvian President from running for Congress or for the Presidency.   Ignoring the law, Ms. Higuchi formed a political movement, called, ironically, Harmony. In October, she filed a petition to run for President, and, in January, a petition to run for Congress. In both cases, the board rejected the petitions on technical grounds. Protesting the latest rejection, Ms. Higuchi embarked on the hunger strike.   Today, with doctors urging her to abandon the protest, Ms. Higuchi might seem to be running low of ammunition in her war against her husband. But few people expect harmony to settle over the Presidential Palace. A few weeks before the election, book stores are to start selling Ms. Higuchi's tell-all memoirs.

Having spoken with literally thousands of parents, children and teachers, we were appalled at the public's wealth of environmental misunderstanding.\n\nWe were equally chagrined by the superficiality of what we heard, and have coined a new term for this type of sound-bite-based, factoid-heavy understanding: eco-glibberish. Here are half a dozen examples:\nRecycling Is the Key\n\n Myth: The most important thing we can do is to recycle. Actually, it's one of the least important things we can do, if our real objective is to conserve resources. Remember the phrase \"reduce, reuse and recycle\"? Reduce comes first for a good reason: it's better to not create waste than to have to figure out what to do with it. And recycling, like any other form of manufacturing, uses energy and other resources while creating pollution and greenhouse gases.\n\nRather, we need to make products more durable, lighter, more energy efficient and easier to repair rather than to replace. Finally, we need to reduce and reuse packaging.\nGarbage Will Overwhelm Us\n\n Myth: There's a garbage crisis. The original garbage crisis occurred when people first settled down to farm and could no longer leave their campsites after their garbage grew too deep. \n\nSince then, every society has had to figure out what to do with discards. That something was usually unhealthy, odiferous and ugly -- throwing garbage in the streets, piling it up just outside of town, incorporating it into structures or simply setting it on fire.\n\nToday we can design history's and the world's safest recycling facilities, landfills and incinerators. We even have a national glut of landfill capacity, thanks to the fact that we've been building large regional landfills to replace older, smaller local dumps.\n\nThe problem is political. No one wants to spend money on just getting rid of garbage or to have a garbage site in the backyard. \n\nThe obvious solution is to stop generating so much garbage in the first place. Doing so requires both the knowledge and self-discipline to conserve energy and to do more with less stuff.\nIndustry Is To Blame\n\n Myth: It's all industry's fault. No, it's all people's fault. Certainly industry has played a significant role in destroying habitats, generating pollution and depleting resources. But we're the ones who signal businesses that what they're doing is acceptable -- every time we open our wallets.\n\nAnd don't just blame industrial societies. In his recent book \"Earth Politics,\" Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker wrote that \"perhaps 90 percent of the extinction of species, soil erosion, forest and wilderness destruction and also desertification are taking place in developing countries.\" Thus, even non-industrialized, subsistence economies are creating environmental havoc.\nThe Earth Is in Peril\n\n Myth: We have to save the earth. Frankly, the earth doesn't need to be saved. \n\nNature doesn't give a hoot if human beings are here or not. The planet has survived cataclysmic and catastrophic changes for millions upon millions of years. Over that time, it is widely believed, 99 percent of all species have come and gone while the planet has remained.\n\nSaving the environment is really about saving our environment -- making it safe for ourselves, our children and the world as we know it. If more people saw the issue as one of saving themselves, we would probably see increased motivation and commitment to actually doing so.\nPackaging Is the Problem\n\n Myth: Packaging accounts for a growing percentage of our solid waste. If you were to examine a dumpster of garbage from the 1950's and a dumpster of garbage from the 1980's, you would find more discarded packaging in the first one. Packaging has actually decreased as a proportion of all solid wastes -- from more than half in the 1950's to just over one-third today.\n\nOne reason is that there was more of other kinds of wastes -- old appliances, magazines, office paper -- in the 1980's. But the main causes were two changes in the packaging industry.\n\nFirst, the heavy metal cans and glass bottles of the 1950's gave way to far lighter and more crushable containers -- about 22 percent lighter by the 1980's. At the same time, many metal and glass containers were replaced by paper boxes and plastic bottles and bins, which are even lighter and more crushable.\n\nSecond, the carrying capacity of packages -- the quantity of product that can be delivered per ounce of packaging material -- increased hugely. \n\nGlass, for example, has a carrying capacity of 1.2, meaning that 1.2 fluid ounces of milk or juice are delivered for every ounce of glass in which they are contained. Plastic containers have a carrying capacity of about 30.\nAmericans Are Wasting More\n\n Myth: Americans are over-consumers, since the per capita creation of solid waste continues to climb.  Each person generates about 4.4 pounds of garbage a day -- a number that has been growing steadily. The implication is that we partake in an unstoppable orgy of consumption. The truth is far more mundane.\n\nIn reality, increases in solid waste are based largely on the mathematics of households, not individuals. That's because regardless of the size of a household, fixed activities and purchases generate trash.\n\nAs new households form, they create additional garbage. Think about a couple going through a divorce. Once there was one home. Now there are two. Building that second house or condo used lots of resources and created lots of construction debris. Where once there was one set of furniture, one washing machine and one refrigerator, now there are two. Each refrigerator contains milk cartons, meat wrappers and packages of mixed vegetables. Each pantry contains cereal boxes and canned goods.\n\nTo make matters worse, households are growing at a fairly rapid rate, almost double the rate of population growth. That's because we're all living longer and away from our children, divorcing more frequently and becoming far more accepting of single-parent households.\n\nCensus Bureau numbers tell this story: From 1972 to 1987, the population grew by 16 percent. The number of households grew by 35 percent. Municipal solid waste increased by 35 percent, too. \n\nIf Americans were really creating more trash by overindulging, we would be spending more on trash-generating items: nondurable goods like food and cosmetics. These all generate lots of garbage, since they are used and discarded quickly, along with their packaging. But household expenditures for nondurable goods, as measured by constant dollars, declined slightly from 1972 to 1987 -- by about one-half of 1 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\nDoes all of this mean we can sit back and relax? No. The earth's resources are finite. Habitats are being destroyed. Biodiversity is declining. And the consumption of resources is expanding.\n\nBut it does mean that we must be less willing to accept glib, ideological pronouncements of right and wrong, good and evil, cause and effect. Thus, to truly change the world for the better, we need more facts, not simply more faith.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950121","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/nyregion/bridge-327795.html","abstract":"  Sixty years ago there was a young actress in New York City named Ann Gallagher.

For a silkier, thicker mane, men and women are lathering up with shampoo and conditioner designed for coarse equine hair. The leading brand, Mane 'n Tail, once available only in horse specialty and feed shops, now sells 95 percent of its product to tail-deprived humans. Four factories work double shifts to fill orders, and annual sales reached $60 million last year (up from $500,000 in 1989). A PHENOMENON IS SIRED: Barely four years ago, Roger Dunavant, the president of Straight Arrow in Bethlehem, Pa., the maker of Mane 'n Tail, handed out samples to horse folk; they told him what a nice job the concoction did on their hair. Soon after, a market study found that 10 of 12 buyers were not using it on their ponies. A LEGAL HORSE RACE: To protect its good mane, Mr. Dunavant has sued 12 companies and accused them of misappropriating the Mane 'n Tail moniker. Dick Kaitz, the executive vice president of Palm Beach Products, makers of Lucky Kentucky Mane, Tail and Body Shampoo, said the charges were baseless: \"They were turned down for a trademark for Mane 'n Tail. We had a legal opinion that gave us the go-ahead.\" A BUCKET JOB: Instructions from the Mane 'n Tail bottle: \"Add 1 oz. per gallon of warm water into a bucket. Pre-wet the coat with just water to remove excessive, loose dirt. Apply shampoo solution with a sponge or massage until a rich lather appears.\" Directions on two new packaged-for-humans lines, Equenne and Conceived by Nature, indicate a little dab of the viscous shampoo will do ya, and forget the bucket. IT ISN'T PRELL, BUT . . .: John Fish, Kmart's hair-care buyer, said customers had requested Mane 'n Tail before he stocked the shelves of the chain's 2,350 stores with it. \"We tested it in our quality assurance department and the information was that it was safe for humans,\" he said. \"It doesn't sell like Pantene Pro-V or Suave, but it sells very well.\" A local price comparison found a 32-ounce bottle of Mane 'n Tail selling for $5.99, or about 19 cents an ounce; a 13-ounce bottle of Pantene for $3.19, or 25 cents an ounce, and a 15-ounce bottle of Suave, 99 cents, or 6 cents an ounce. CELEBRITY NEIGH-SAYER: On the \"Late Show With David Letterman,\" Terry Bradshaw, Fox's football commentator, confided that the equine rinse had grown hair atop his bare dome, a renaissance thus far undetectable to the TV-watching eye. Mr. Dunavant said he couldn't make such a claim, \"or the F.D.A. will force me to do a $50 million study.\" But he added, \"I haven't lost any hair since I started using it.\" I'VE GOT THE MOUSSE . . .: Now there are Mane 'n Tail hair spray, perm enhancer, mousse and detangler (all for humans only), as well as The Hoofmaker, a skin moisturizer that doubles as a fingernail strengthener.

It became increasingly clear, though, that the two art forms spoke different languages. And while Hollywood continued to buy up Broadway's hits, commercial (never mind artistic) success on stage was no guarantee of similar results on film.

Otherwise, why would all of us bother to clamber into those ghastly flying machines and head off to parts unknown for mishaps unimagined? More likely, this recurrent yearning to return to a state of viewing virginity is peculiar to a place whose only raison d'etre is making an astonishing first impression. Would that I could see Venice today as I did riding with my family in a private motorized rowboat manned by a captain in a candy-striped shirt, when I was a freckled, crew-cut 10-year-old who couldn't imagine how a city had waterways for byways.

The classical-concert form, once a seemingly inviolate set of practices and behaviors, is in transition.   For several generations, the concert has had an almost ritualistic quality. A two-hour event, it generally offers works in 19th-century styles, beginning with an overture or other curtain-raiser, proceeding to a concerto or other showpiece and concluding (after intermission) with a grand symphony or a work demanding unusual concentration. Encores are chosen to amaze and entertain, with acrobatic marvels or disarmingly simple lyricism.

Only 18 months ago birch trees were still growing among the palace's few remaining, smoke-stained walls. But on Jan. 2 the Grand Hotel Taschenbergpalais Kempinski Dresden opened on the site.   The ornate palace was built in the early 18th century by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, as a residence for his mistress, Anna Constantia von Cosel. The court architect Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann, who also built the famous Dresden Zwinger complex, completed the building in 1711. It later became one of the residences of the Saxon royal family.   The hotel is in the heart of Dresden, surrounded by landmarks such as the Residenz Castle, the Church of the Cross, the Zwinger museums and art galleries, as well as the Semper Opera House. It has 213 guest rooms, including 25 suites, in a modern style with clean lines, contrasting with the building's elaborate, classical exterior.   Until March 31 the hotel is offering an introductory rate of $155 a night for both single and double rooms.   After the official grand opening on March 31, rates will range from $220 to $270 for a single, and from $250 to $300 for a double room.    More information: Am Taschenberg, 01067 Dresden, Germany.

Given the space presided over by Mr. Golio and the sculptors in Mrs. Udell's stable, the collaboration was inevitable. Chappaqua Library is a grand spread with walls inside and out made of blond concrete that has a ridged surface reminiscent of wide-wale corduroy. While the roughly 14-year-old structure is the last word in the International Style, the grounds have a medieval touch in the stream that flows around the edge like a moat.

In the gallery is a show of paintings by Belle Manes and small bronzes by Isabel Shaw, which was selected by Mr. Golio's predecessor. Ms. Manes has exhibited her still lives and interiors with figures in the galleries and museums of Connecticut and Westchester for more than a decade, during which time her compositions seem to have grown denser and her colors stronger. Where some might regard drawing and painting as separate activities, this artist does the two simultaneously, building up masses even as she defines and redefines their contours.

For many centuries bazaars have brought together in one immense place religion, political power and the economic life of cities from Morocco to Central Asia. In THE PERSIAN BAZAAR: Veiled Space of Desire (Mage, $50), Mehdi Khansari and Minouch Yavari, scholars of history and architecture (and husband and wife), reveal the social logic underlying these magnificent structures -- in drawings and words, but most vividly in photographs that let one discover the magic cave that is a bazaar as if one were walking through it, assaulted by the sounds of potters, cabinet makers, farriers and merchants of everything from bread to gold, seduced by the odor of spices and coffee, dazzled by light drifting down from the pierced domes and scattered by brilliantly glazed arches and ceilings onto crowds winding far below among fabrics and carpets, donkeys and carts, dust and incense. From the public hall called in Arabic qaisariya (\"Caesar's room,\" suggesting a connection between the oldest bazaars and ancient Roman basilicas) to mosque and seminary and bathhouse, from quiet terraced religious clubhouse to teeming caravansary -- here is the bazaar, made even more appealing by the realization that the global spread of the modern industrial economy has probably doomed this beautiful house of life.
