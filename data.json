Lindbergh, whom she met two years after his historic 1927 flight. The Lindberghs' 45-year marriage forms the centerpiece of this thoroughgoing portrait by Dorothy Herrmann, whose previous biography was of S. J. Perelman. Although Harold Nicolson described Mrs. Lindbergh with blithe condescension as \"an adorable little person,\" she proved equal to the dangerous, even death-defying pioneer flights she later wrote about, on which she accompanied her famous husband, serving as co-pilot, radio operator and all-round good sport. In 1932, she endured the kidnapping and murder of their firstborn son and the relentless press coverage the event produced. Later she weathered the fall from public grace that the couple experienced over Lindbergh's rigidly isolationist and pro-Nazi views, aspects of which she shared. While Ms. Herrmann seems intent on rescuing Mrs. Lindbergh's lyrical if occasionally cloying writings (13 books of nonfiction, poetry, fiction and memoir in addition to her 1955 best seller \"Gift From the Sea\"), her subject ultimately trips up the biographer. Because Mrs. Lindbergh placed duty to her husband before devotion to her craft, Ms. Herrmann suggests, her longevity as a writer was compromised. \"In a sense,\" she writes, Lindbergh \"and their extraordinary life together were her only subject.\" If that is so, then perhaps it is no coincidence that Mrs. Lindbergh, now 86 years old, has published virtually nothing since 1974, the year her husband died.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"President Asserts His Opponents 'Lack the Vision' on the Economy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/us/president-asserts-his-opponents-lack-the-vision-on-the-economy.html","abstract":"  President Clinton, seeking to counter accusations that his Administration is more interested in spending money than in cutting the deficit, said today that his critics \"lack the vision\" to improve the economy.

A man of my age, bearing an uncanny resemblance to me and calling himself Philip Roth, turned up in Jerusalem shortly before I did and set about proselytizing for \"Diasporism,\" a political program he'd devised advocating that the Jews of Israel return to their European countries of origin in order to avert \"a second Holocaust,\" this one at the hands of the Arabs. Inasmuch as his imposturing constituted a crisis I was living rather than writing, it embodied a form of self-denunciation that I could not sanction, a satirizing of me so bizarre and unrealistic as to exceed by far the boundaries of amusing mischief I may myself have playfully perpetrated on my own existence in fiction.\n\nNow, in life as in art, mischief can be a relief from all the prescriptions. The more scrupulously exacting the prescriptions, the greater the relief afforded by the mischief. Perhaps because of the abundance of prescriptions both internally and externally generated by Jewish history, perhaps because of the singular sort of care that living as a Jew has generally required, perhaps because of the exaggerated seriousness with which a thoughtful Jew is often burdened, Jewish mischief -- as couched, say, in the inexhaustible jokes about their peculiarities that Jews themselves so much enjoy -- flourishes, surprisingly enough, in even the most superdignified Jewish circles. The mischief subverts all the strategies that the Jewish predicament imposes, affords immeasurable if transitory relief not only because it is counterprohibitive but because it is counterparanoid as well, indifferent to threat, to enemies, to all the defenses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"THE TWIN TOWERS: The Bomb; Stored Chemicals Were Blast Waiting to Happen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/the-twin-towers-the-bomb-stored-chemicals-were-blast-waiting-to-happen.html","abstract":"  Investigators working on the bombing of the World Trade Center said yesterday that some of the chemicals found at a self-storage locker in Jersey City had been combined in a highly volatile mixture that could have exploded with great force at any time.   \"All you needed for a big explosion was a drastic change in temperature or for someone to knock over one of the containers,\" said one explosives expert who has been monitoring the investigation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"NO MORE NICE GIRLS\nCountercultural Essays.\nBy Ellen Willis.\nWesleyan University/University Press of New England, $22.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Honoring New York Citizens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/style/evening-hours-honoring-new-york-citizens.html","abstract":"  The Municipal Art Society's salute, Feb. 28.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Knee Sidelines Bream","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/sports/sports-people-baseball-knee-sidelines-bream.html","abstract":"  First baseman SID BREAM of the Braves underwent surgery late Friday night in Atlanta to remove a bone chip from his right knee and he might not be ready to play when the major league season opens in Chicago on April 5.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Holding On and Letting Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/books/holding-on-and-letting-go.html","abstract":"  ANNA   A Daughter's Life.

Danto raises the issue of consent. Unlike Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand or Diane Arbus, who all caught their subjects off guard, unaware or simply not knowing how they would look, Mapplethorpe got his subjects' full trust because he was part of their world. The thrill of these photographs, writes Mr. Danto, the art critic for The Nation, is that of \"the child who finds it delicious to be thrown in the air, certain his father will not let him fall.\" Thus, rather than catching the suspicious glare and passionate flurry of hostile strangers, Mapplethorpe caught the calm, clear look of those who want to be seen, say, urinating into the mouth of a friend, or up to their elbows in someone else's anus. Whether he was photographing the artist Alice Neel's ragged face when she was near death, or his roommate, the singer Patti Smith, nude and clutching some radiator pipes like a mental patient, or Mr. 10 1/2 exhibiting his organ on a table like a slab of meat, the staginess, the stillness, the symmetry all indicate Mapplethorpe's subjects were not just about to walk out of his viewfinder or his world. But what did he get from the luxury of consent? In a word, domestication. Even the most shocking photographs are tamed by the permission implicit in them. The picture of Elliott grabbing the testicles of Dominick, who is chained upside down, is so planned that it looks, as Mr. Danto says, like \"a fisherman being photographed next to some immense tuna he has caught.\" And one of the best shots, \"Man in a Polyester Suit,\" featuring a smooth, uncircumcised penis lolling out of a man's fly, is funny because it is so offhand. Mapplethorpe got so much permission for so many things that he made us forget, at least occasionally, what he was getting away with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"For Gay People, a Time of Triumph and Fear","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/for-gay-people-a-time-of-triumph-and-fear.html","abstract":"  After enduring weeks of vitriol in battles over homosexuals in the military, the St. Patrick's Day parade and school curriculums, gay and lesbian New Yorkers are taking stock -- many hurt and angry, others scared but defiant.   \"It's terrifying that outright bigotry against us is acceptable public discourse,\" said Howard Cruise, 48, a cartoonist who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens. \"People wouldn't dare talk about any other group, blacks or whatever, the way they talk about us.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"A U.S. Hotel List Notes Fire Safety","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/travel/practical-traveler-a-us-hotel-list-notes-fire-safety.html","abstract":"  FIRE safety for travelers moved ahead as this year opened. The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 began to have an impact on the marketplace with a drastic revision of the Federal Travel Directory. This makes it the first guide to American lodging that lists only places that have a smoke detector in every room, wired into the hotel's electric system, and, in the case of buildings taller than three stories, have installed a sprinkler system. Battery-operated smoke detectors are unacceptable because batteries wear out and can be stolen.    The Federal Travel Directory has been published for years, but now the safety act dictates that it may list no American hotel or motel unless it conforms to the law's provisions. To accomplish this, the Government gathered a list of conforming properties from the states and territories and then purged from the Federal Travel Directory all the places not on this master list, shrinking the directory from 9,000 listings in December to 4,164 in January. Federal Travel Directory    The Federal Travel Directory is not a likely rival for the Mobil Guide or the A.A.A. Tour Book, because the type is pretty small and there are no pictures. You have probably never seen it unless you are a Government employee, but it is revised and published anew each month, and anyone can buy a copy for $13. The initial issues for 1993 by no means include all the places that have taken the fire-safety steps; some have not gotten their reports into the system, although Government officials expect the data gathering, which is being accomplished through state fire marshals, to catch up soon. In any case, unless a hotel offers a \"government rate,\" meaning a discount, it is not included.

(\"The sardonic rat of no man's land,\" Harpur's wife calls him.) Given the morally ambiguous climate of this treacherous nether world, mistakes can be made, as Sarah Iles, the wild young wife of Harpur's boss, learns in COME CLEAN (Foul Play/Countryman, $20) when she goes slumming with an attractive gangster. After witnessing a killing in an underworld bar, Sarah and her lover are marked for assassination by both parties in a territorial gang war.   Although the plot takes the requisite crooked turns on its way to a violent finale, the characters are what give this series its hard-bitten brilliance. Saving the psychological realism for dreary people like Sarah (\"stuck in that wrong, bleak marriage\"), Mr. James lets his language soar with his criminals, characterizing mobsters like Benny Loxton and Leo Tacette in a mock-heroic style that confers dignity as well as absurdity on their aspirations for greatness. Let other chroniclers revile them for their evil deeds and vulgar accents; in the eyes of their poet laureate, men like Benny and Leo are epic villains.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Haitian Dissident Loses Plea for U.S. Refugee Visa","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/world/haitian-dissident-loses-plea-for-us-refugee-visa.html","abstract":"  In a case that international human rights groups say exemplifies the flaws in a Clinton Administration program to grant asylum to Haitians fleeing persecution in their country, a dissident who fled his hometown after being severely beaten by the military has been denied a visa to the United States.

The Abbey, the official national theater, is also providing some heat with a flickering controversy about its artistic director, Garry Hynes.   Since Ms. Hynes, who is 39, arrived in Dublin from provincial Galway County, to take over the Abbey two years ago, she has been the constant target of the Dublin theatrical establishment, led by newspaper and magazine critics. They slashed her 1991 production of \"The Plough and the Stars,\" largely because she had audaciously presented Sean O'Casey's gloomy characters with shaven heads, recalling Sinead O'Connor, to the dismay of many Dubliners who detest that singer. Since then, she has been under attack for putting on the wrong plays, for putting them on with imported actors (like Brian Dennehy, who filled the house with his portrayal of Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's \"Iceman Cometh\") and for ignoring the players of the Abbey's own permanent company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"U.N.

That is the amount of life savings that a person can keep if the spouse is to qualify for Medicaid. It does not include the value of a family house and a small amount of monthly income.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"THE TWIN TOWERS: The Overview; Clues and Tempers Grow In Widened Bomb Search","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/nyregion/the-twin-towers-the-overview-clues-and-tempers-grow-in-widened-bomb-search.html","abstract":"  Seeking new evidence to explain the role that Mohammed A.

That's an allowable position for a conservative pol, if only the status quo in question were not a corrupt, outdated and harmful one. As the G.O.P.'s designated hitter on all issues pertaining to campaign finance reform, Mr. McConnell told the Senate Rules Committee not to bother about the talk that senators spend too much time raising campaign money. It's a point many senators would probably dispute if they weren't so busy scrounging for funds. As the chart at right suggests, the senators have to churn out a lot of cash.    Mr. McConnell calls the Democrats' proposal to clean up campaign financing in part by using taxpayer funds an \"entitlement program for politicians.\" It's a mystery why a Republican would want to prolong the system under which his party lost control of the Senate. In truth, as Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, the chief sponsor of the Democratic reform plan, strongly notes, it's the present system that's the real entitlement program -- but for incumbents only.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930308","headline":"Violently, Drug Trafficking in Mexico Rebounds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/08/world/violently-drug-trafficking-in-mexico-rebounds.html","abstract":"  Without knowing of its reputation, without hearing it called \"Little Medellin,\" it might be difficult to recognize this bustling provincial capital as the historic center of Mexico's drug trade.

A4 CHINA EASES CURBS ON GROWTH   China's Communist leadership approved a revised five-year plan, setting more ambitious growth targets and thereby snubbing Prime Minister Li Peng. It also endorsed a reshuffle of Government leaders.

A1 CLINTON, NIXON AND YELTSIN   As political odd couples go, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon surely rank with the oddest. But there they were, the Vietnam dove and the Vietnam hawk, sitting around the White House living room bound together by their shared support of of increased aid to Russia.  A1 ZAIRE'S BATTLING LEADERS   The President and the Prime Minister of Zaire both say they have the authority to rule the large, impoverished African nation. Their battle for control has paralyzed the Government and cast doubt about its future stability.  A3 EVACUATION OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS   The Bosnian Serbs' military commander agreed to allow a limited evacuation of Muslims from isolated areas of eastern Bosnia, United Nations and Serbian officials said.  A6 VIOLENCE AGAINST SERBS   Some of the Serbs who remained in Gorazde after Serbian \"ethnic cleansing\" got under way in eastern Bosnia have been put to death as suspected snipers.  A6 News analysis: The obstacles to finding peace in Bosnia.  A7 DEBATE OVER MIDEAST AID MONEY   The Clinton Administration was forced by an influential Democrat in Congress to confront the delicate subject of whether the United States can afford to pour billions of dollars into Israel and Egypt.  A9 ISRAELI SETTLER SLAIN IN GAZA   Palestinian laborers stabbed an Israeli to death in a Jewish settlement, hours after the army opened the Gaza Strip after six days, the Israeli military said.  A9 IRISH LEADER TO MEET CLINTON   When Prime Minister Albert Reynolds meets Mr. Clinton on St. Patrick's Day, he plans to discuss the President's ideas for a U.S. policy on Northern Ireland.  A8 ENGLISH TRADITION: FISH AND CHIPS   Birmingham Journal: Fish and chips endures as England's original hot fast food, a quintessential institution. More than 9,000 outlets, mostly mom-and-pop storefronts, dispense the vinegary fare.  A4 National A12-16 WEIGHING LIMITS ON MEDICAL FEES    As part of their effort to control health costs, Clinton Administration officials are considering asking Congress to impose restrictions on medical malpractice lawsuits and limits on doctors' fees.  A1 STOCKS REACH A NEW PEAK   Stocks soared to new highs as investors braved the market's risks in search of returns no longer available from bank accounts and bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.84 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 3,469.42.  A1 LESSONS FROM POLICE-KILLERS   Two F.B.I. agents interviewed 50 killers of police officers in an effort to discover what the victims could have done differently. The result is a chilling collection of murderous narratives that could change officers' behavior.  A1 KING EXPECTED ON WITNESS STAND   Rodney King is expected to testify for the first time in the case of Los Angeles four police officers accused of violating his civil rights.  A12 HOLY WAR FOR CULT?   Law-enforcement officials brought in the Army's heaviest tanks and the leader of the Texas cult involved in a bloody shootout and subsequent siege said he might welcome an apocalyptic fire fight rather than a gentle surrender.  A12 LABOR PACT UPHELD   In a victory for organized labor, the Supreme Court validated a union-only labor agreement in the cleanup of Boston Harbor, ruling that states were free to negotiate such pacts. The Justices also let stand a lower court ruling that declared Louisiana's strict abortion law unconstitutional.  A13 RENO'S RECORD IS DEBATED    President Clinton praised Janet Reno, his choice for Attorney General, as a \"front-line crime fighter.\" But her office has lagged behind other Florida prosecutors in several measures, including the rate at which they take cases to trial, win guilty verdicts and obtain prison sentences.  A14 CLINTON'S POWERFUL COUNSEL   Other White House counsels have wielded great power. But because of the vacancies at the Justice Department, Clinton's counsel, Bernard Nussbaum, is in the unusual position of making some of the department's most important decisions.  A14 THINKING OF CUTS   Clinton and Congressional budget writers agreed to make deeper cuts in Federal programs than the President had originally sought. It was a grudging bow to political as well as fiscal imperatives.  A15 The Administration defended U.S. policy on Haitian refugees.  A16 Metro Digest B1 DOCTORS WHO'VE HAD ENOUGH   Throughout the New York region and across the country, senior, seasoned doctors are choosing to retire early because of what they see as a loss of control to insurance companies and government agencies.  A1 SUSPECT'S ROLE IN BOMBING   Federal and local investigators believe that Mohammed A. Salameh, the 25-year-old suspect arrested in the bombing of the World Trade Center, played a significant role in what they say is a conspiracy.

He helped more than 500 Allied pilots to escape from France, leading to his arrest by the Gestapo in January 1944.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Review/Piano; A Schubertian Realm of Simplicity in Quietude","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/arts/review-piano-a-schubertian-realm-of-simplicity-in-quietude.html","abstract":"  Strange are the ways of musical chemistry, especially when the ingredients are as different in appearance as Maurizio Pollini and the music of Schubert. Mr. Pollini has become our prototype of high-tech pianistic virtuosity: moving parts of astonishing efficiency administered by thoughtful, clear-headed intelligence. His amazing skills have wiped the sweat from the most prodigiously difficult endeavors, allowing listeners a calm, measured look at music usually bound up in the struggles of the performer.   Schubert, himself a pianist of uneven accomplishment, was a dealer in dreams and a communicator of personal loss. The compelling nature of nostalgia is the intense pleasure of its pains, and so the dotted rhythm that announces his G-major Sonata (D. 894) is a cry of loneliness sent out across an unbridgeable divide and at the same time an expression of self-sufficient serenity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Dehere Is Top Player","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/sports/sports-people-college-basketball-dehere-is-top-player.html","abstract":"  TERRY DEHERE of Seton Hall yesterday was selected as the Big East Conference's player of the year.

By the end of a day in which the Democrats' spending-cut fervor took on the tone of a bidding war, the House Democrats were floating two different figures -- $55 billion and $63 billion -- for two different plans to add more cuts to Mr. Clinton's. But since very few spending cuts were identified for achieving any of those figures, it was difficult to tell what, if anything, the plans had in common. Deficit Bidding War    The White House said Mr. Clinton had agreed in an afternoon meeting with the House Budget Committee's Democrats to shave an extra $55 billion off Federal spending from 1994 through 1998, mostly by trimming relatively minor amounts from each of an array of Government programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/nyregion/c-corrections-850693.html","abstract":"  An article yesterday about Connecticut women in Congress referred incorrectly to the dean of the delegation.

By evening's end, the audience will have seen a husband and wife beat each other senseless, and another husband return home to his wife with welts on his back after a night of flagellation by a transvestite. As a framed dime-store Jesus looks down from the wall, the whipped husband drops to his knees, demanding still more punishment. His wife obliges, pouring alcohol on his open wounds.   Such is the tough theatrical currency of \"Aven' U Boys,\" a work in which the agonized screams of the characters often blend into the apocalyptic metal-on-metal screech of the el roaring above their heads. The audience at the John Houseman Theater, or at least that part of it with strong stomachs, holds on tight. \"Aven' U Boys\" is not for those with a low tolerance for verbal and visual violence, but it can be enthusiastically recommended to anyone who wants to step into a fever dream of urban America 1993, as searingly realized by a new and gifted 29-year-old playwright named Frank Pugliese and as played for keeps by a half-dozen young actors of exciting promise. While Mr. Pugliese's Italian-American Brooklyn overlaps the Brooklyn or Bronx of Richard Price, Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese, his gripping style, in which fragmented dialogue and incidents seem to slice through the night like switch blades, casts its own disturbing spell.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930309","headline":"Clinton Challenged on Share of U.S. Aid Going to Israel and Egypt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/09/world/clinton-challenged-on-share-of-us-aid-going-to-israel-and-egypt.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration was forced by an influential Democrat in Congress today to confront the delicate subject of whether the United States can afford to pour billions of dollars into Israel and Egypt in light of a shrinking foreign aid budget and President Clinton's determination to resuscitate the American economy.
