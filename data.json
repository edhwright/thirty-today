So the sailoff held today, the final race of the semifinals, held little significance as Mighty Mary beat Stars & Stripes by 5 minutes 59 seconds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950405","headline":"IN PERFORMANCE: CLASSICAL MUSIC","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/arts/in-performance-classical-music-158195.html","abstract":"  Chopin in the Afternoon With Attention to Nocturnes  Garrick Ohlsson Alice Tully Hall    Garrick Ohlsson continued his admirable Chopin series on Sunday afternoon with a collection of nocturnes, mazurkas and polonaises and a sprinkling of isolated favorites as well.

The customizer here was Riccardo Chailly, who succeeded Bernard Haitink as chief conductor in 1988, and who has traded the luxurious warmth that Mr. Haitink and his predecessors had cultivated for the kind of brightness and brass-driven power of the Chicago Symphony during Georg Solti's tenure. Mr. Chailly has, in effect, turned a luxury car into a hot rod.    No doubt many concertgoers find this metamorphosis all to the good. Times and tastes change, after all, and these days gleaming precision and sheer sonic force are high on the list of orchestral virtues. Besides, whether one regards the Concertgebouw's flashy new sound as thrilling or coarse, it cannot be denied that section for section it remains one of the world's most polished ensembles. But not long ago it was also an orchestra with a distinctive sound. Now that distinctiveness has given way to the school of homogenous international virtuosity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950405","headline":"A Morality Tale About Everybody's Fall Guy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/theater/theater-review-a-morality-tale-about-everybody-s-fall-guy.html","abstract":"  The Atlantic Theater Company's \"Luck, Pluck and Virtue,\" written and directed by James Lapine, is a gelatinous satire that plays as if it had been conceived by someone locked too long in the stacks of the New York Public Library.

The Atlantic Division leaders trailed by 18 when Anderson, who suffered a concussion when he bumped heads with Detroit's Rafael Addison, was removed from the court on a stretcher early in the second quarter.

The 246-to-188 vote, largely along party lines, put the House's stamp on a plan that would reduce tax revenues by $189 billion over five years, fully $105 billion of that in the form of a $500-a-child credit to taxpaying families. Billions more would go to breaks aimed at retirees, investors and corporations. The bill now goes to a Senate far less inclined toward major tax reduction this year, but whose leader, Senator Bob Dole, faces strong pressure from within his own party to follow the House's lead. RATING CONGRESS -- The public gives a decidedly mixed review of the Republican Congress's first 100 days and is particularly skeptical about the leadership's ability to deliver both large tax cuts and a balanced budget, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.

June Leaf, an underrated member of the rich tradition of figurative art that came out of Abstract Expressionism, is such an artist. A feminist of the old school, she equates women's bodies with the frets of guitars, attaching them in both paintings and sculpture to swelling boatlike shapes that also cast them as figureheads. Her paintings are infused with a vague primordial narrative in which these figures and others inhabit abstract landscapes whose wavering, shifting surfaces are as much scratched into existence as painted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950407","headline":"Savard Returns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/sports/sports-people-hockey-savard-returns.html","abstract":"  Desperate for an offensive center to replace the injured JEREMY ROENICK, the Chicago Blackhawks reacquired DENIS SAVARD, one of their franchise's greatest stars, yesterday.

His spare yet ever-expanding vocabulary includes white grid sculptures capable of a nearly Piranesian complexity, and a profusion of wall drawings in pencil and bright ink that have left few geometric stones unturned. These drawings are executed by assistants following written instructions whose fusion of the linguistic, the visual and the philosophical makes them a minor art form in their own right. With Mr. LeWitt's photographs, prints and drawings on paper taken into account, no one except Donald Judd has so thoroughly overturned the notion of the Minimal while remaining true to first principles.   At the moment, three sides of Mr. LeWitt's complex sensibility are visible in exhibitions in SoHo and the South Village, more than Manhattan has seen in some time. A show of enormous sculptures at Ace Gallery New York is buttressed by an exhibition of wall drawings at the Lawrence Markey Gallery and a show of 45 working drawings on paper at the John Weber Gallery, the artist's longtime representative.

Four horrific bursts of killing have erupted between the majority Hutu and the militarily dominant Tutsi since the country won independence from Belgium in 1962. The most recent, in 1993, cost 150,000 lives. Now, a year after Hutu fanatics slaughtered 500,000 Tutsi in neighboring Rwanda, Burundi seems to be slipping toward a fresh calamity.   For weeks, Tutsi-led army and militia units have been attacking Hutu civilians, killing scores, even hundreds at a time. Hutu militia groups have been fighting back. But most Hutu have simply taken flight, swelling the region's already huge refugee population.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950407","headline":"SHORT CUTS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/style/IHT-short-cuts.html","abstract":"Some of the finest piano trio albums in the history of jazz are being made in our time..-.

Every head in the restaurant turned to watch as they were seated at a front table. Those pink clouds were so mesmerizing that everyone in the long, dark room waited to see if the women would remove them. We waited all evening and when they finally got up and left, hats still firmly anchored to their heads, a collective sigh zipped around the room.    This display was particularly impressive, given the difficulty of making an entrance at Zut! The fabulously silly room captures most of the attention. The eye is first caught by the animals cavorting over the circular bar and then bounces to the chandeliers made of giant straw hats. By the time it discovers the musical giraffes, dancing rabbits and bridge-playing penguins on the wallpaper, it is hooked. There is so much to discover: sombrero mirrors, copper monkey panels, gold animals twinkling on the ceiling like urban constellations. This is one of the most playful spaces in New York City.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950407","headline":"Whitman Protested in Capital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-whitman-protested-in-capital.html","abstract":"  Gov.
