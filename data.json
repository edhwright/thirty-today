He is fortunate to have as his guide Dr. David M. Eisenberg of the Harvard Medical School, a student of Chinese medicine. Dr. Eisenberg, who helped do a survey released last month that found that Americans spent $13.7 billion on alternative medicine in 1990, manages to be appreciative of the Chinese way of looking at health without going gaga about it; his steady approach lends credibility to a subject that has been known to turn some minds a little soft.   The first of five programs investigates the phenomenon called chi, which has to do with the flow through the body of what a Chinese doctor calls \"the force of life.\" Looking in at hospitals where traditional Chinese medicine is practiced, the Americans find that illnesses caused by obstructions to that flow are treated with herbs, needles, massage and meditation. Dr. Eisenberg quotes a Taoist proverb: \"When you have a disease do not try to cure; find your center and you will be healed.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930222","headline":"Vanity With a Purpose; States Expand Specialty License Plates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/nyregion/vanity-with-a-purpose-states-expand-specialty-license-plates.html","abstract":"  Into an age of Raiders jackets, X caps and Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts as ubiquitous as Lyme ticks comes the license plate with attitude -- both political and fashionable.

That's what folk music was, anyway, until Luka Bloom grabbed hold of it. Mr. Bloom is an Irish performer who would probably prefer to be called a rock musician or even a hip-hop artist, but performing solo on Monday night at the Bottom Line, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, he fit a surface description of a folkie. His jeans, illustrated with a painting of Malcolm X, displayed his progressive politics; his mellifluous singing of verses devoted to the old themes of love, tradition and survival indicated his affinity to bards ranging from Percy Shelley to Michelle Shocked.

Calling on the unshakable nerves of youth, the 22-year-old left-hander conducted a putting clinic over the back nine at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, Calif., as he pulled away to a four-shot victory in the Buick Invitational. Mickelson, still wearing the can't-miss label earned in his spectacular amateur career, won his hometown tournament with a seven-under-par 65, including a decisive 31 over the back nine. Mickelson, who passed up a $180,000 prize to retain his amateur status when he won a PGA Tour event in Tucson in 1991, recouped that exact amount in the tournament he first attended as a boy from nearby San Diego and in which he once served as a standard-bearer. His mother, Mary, and father, Phil, a former instructor at the Navy's Top Gun School at nearby Miramar and the man who taught the game to his preschool son, were in the gallery as Mickelson began to fulfill the promise of his amateur days with a 10-under-par 278 winning total.

As the Olympic silver medalist in the giant slalom last year in France, Roffe-Steinrotter came to the Subaru United States Alpine championships here this week with a reputation as big as all outdoors. But she had been on a losing streak, despite her domination of the national event last year with gold medals in three events.    That changed today, the last day for the women in this competition. Roffe-Steinrotter, a 25-year-old skier from Potsdam, N.Y., streaked down a course laced with 45-mile-an-hour gusts of wind, and blowing snow. She finished first, with a total from two runs of 2 minutes 8.04 seconds. In second-place was Julie Parisien, of Auburn, Me., in 2:09.12; Heidi Voelker, of Pittsfield, Mass., was third in 2:09.57. No Sense Complaining    The women competed in conditions that Parisien said would have caused World Cup officials to cancel a race. But Roffe-Steinrotter said the weather turned out to be an advantage.   \"I grew up in the East,\" she said, referring to the cold, icy slopes where she learned to ski. \"Let other people stand up at the top and complain. It doesn't make much sense when you have a job to do.\"   It has been a tough year for Roffe-Steinrotter. She has not been able to duplicate her 1992 season, which included a spectacular run on the World Cup circuit and a No. 3 ranking in the world giant slalom standing.   \"For me, maybe I have been trying too hard,\" Roffe-Steinrotter said. \"My expectations at the beginning of the season were too high. Maybe I put too much pressure on myself and forgot to ski with the freedom you need to ski with.\" A Trying Year    The 21-year-old Parisien has also overcome a trying year. Ranked No. 1 in the world in slalom at the beginning of this season, she won the first World Cup slalom, at Park City, Utah. But she was sidelined temporarily in January with a knee injury, and is still reeling from the death in December of her brother, Jean Paul.    But in the championships here, Parisien regained some of her prowess. Besides the giant slalom, she won a silver medal in the super giant slalom, and a bronze in the slalom. She also won a gold medal in the combined, a total of all four events including the downhill.   \"I'm a little disappointed in my downhill,\" Parisien said. \"I was seventh, and I definitely think I should have been in the top five. But over all, I'm psyched. I pulled myself together after being really tired after Japan.\"   As did the other world-class skiers here, Parisien competed two weeks ago in the world Alpine championships in Shizukuishi, Japan, where she won a silver medal in the slalom. A Near Sweep    This is the third year in a row that Voelker, 23, won a bronze medal at the nationals. \"I'm very happy with my third-place,\" she said, noting that the competition has been more intense than in other years.   The United States women's team excelled here, winning 13 of 15 medals. The other two went to Lindsey Roberts of Canada. Picabo Street, of Sun Valley, Idaho, who has emerged lately as a major world-class contender, won the silver in the combined; and Kristi Terzian, of Park City, Utah, won the bronze.   The American men were under much more pressure from the Canadians. So far, the Canadian men's team has won four medals, compared with five for the United States. The men are scheduled to race their giant slalom on Monday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930222","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/arts/dance-in-review-726493.html","abstract":"  Yanceydance Theater  Ohio Theater  SoHo    Leslie Yancey creates considerable atmosphere in \"Trio,\" the opening work of an evening of theater-dance pieces presented on Thursday.

At the end of the sold-out concert, on Saturday night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., flocks of women were finding their way up to kiss the group's charismatic lead singer, Jon Bon Jovi, dance with him a bit, and be photographed not just in his presence, but also all over and around his presence. It was rock celebrity pandemonium, and everybody, fans and band alike, were having a great time.   One of the great myths fueling rock suggests that lower-middle-class people, usually male and white, can both make oodles of money and maintain the rebellious stance so important to rock's adolescent audience. There's a clear contradiction in the myth, and Bon Jovi, as well as any band alive, has learned to play both sides of the problem. In 1986, when the band's record \"Slippery When Wet\" (Polygram) began its ascent, eventually selling some 13 million copies, Bon Jovi was the ideal prole band, a group of guys from New Jersey who hit it big. In their clothes, action and lyrics, the band pointed to a blue-collar tradition not so much linked to the urban decay mined by self-conscious prole poets like Bruce Springsteen, but to a suburban reality found in mall glamour and wasted Saturday nights. Mr. Bon Jovi, with his long blond hair, became a rock celebrity who was a hunk, enormously wealthy and who could sing songs like \"Wild in the Streets.\" Critics, preferring to celebrate older, more romantic types of working-class rebellion, hated -- and still hate -- the band.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930222","headline":"Put American Troops in Macedonia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/opinion/put-american-troops-in-macedonia.html","abstract":"So far, Washington's Balkan policy has been built on principles of bluster and bluff.

Yet, as the Government takes a fresh look at its sprawling $73 billion research establishment, it remains unclear how the White House hopes to coordinate the activities of dozens of agencies, how it plans to select which projects to finance and how it intends to evaluate the progress of the overall effort.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930224","headline":"Time to Stop the Posturing Over Welfare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/24/opinion/l-time-to-stop-the-posturing-over-welfare-400893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Caution on Welfare?\" (news analysis, Feb. 3), about President Clinton's proposed welfare reform, is appropriately skeptical, but doesn't go far enough to unmask the posturing over this contentious issue.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930224","headline":"Incentive Plan Seeks to Save G.M.

Boston University's 7-6 overtime triumph at Orono on Friday ended Maine's undefeated status this season after 32 games, 30 of them victories. Also concluding were unbeaten streaks of 50 games (46-0-4) at home; 44 regular-season games (40-0-4) and 33 contests (30-0-3) against Hockey East opponents.     Mike Prendergast, Boston University's sophomore forward from South Boston, who had been out a month because of a knee injury, ended all that when his shot went by Mike Dunham at 1 minute 50 seconds of overtime. Dunham, a United States Olympian a year ago, had been unbeaten for Maine in his last 24 games. The Terriers overcame a 6-2 deficit.    The next night Maine won, 6-1, and the two referees, Frank Cole and Drew Taylor, called 51 penalties for a total of 150 minutes, both Hockey East records. There were six 10-minute misconduct penalties, all in the third period. Four Maine goals came on power plays.   The Terriers never stopped Paul Kariya, Maine's celebrated freshman, who had seven assists in the two games. Kariya has 44 assists for 58 points, a 2.9 average, in 20 league games. Penalties? One, for two minutes.   Rankings   The voters in The Albany Times Union's poll, 12 coaches and 13 news media representatives, still like Maine. The Black Bears gained 24 first-place votes. The other vote went to No. 2 Michigan. Harvard is No. 3; Miami of Ohio, No. 4 and Boston University, No. 5.    Then come Minnesota-Duluth, No. 6; Lake Superior State, No. 7; Wisconsin, No. 8; Rensselaer, No. 9, and Clarkson and Minnesota tied for No. 10.     The poll ran counter to the Central Association standing, which finds Miami of Ohio continuing in first place with a 3-point lead over Lake Superior State and Michigan. The latter two meet on Friday at Ann Arbor, Mich. Women's Tournament  College hockey for women is making steady progress, according to Heather Linstad, the Northeastern coach. \"The caliber of players is improving,\" she said. \"And there are many more opportunties, like our national team and participation in the Olympic festival.\"    The Eastern College Athletic Association is sponsoring its first women's tournament, which begins tonight with St. Lawrence (6-6) at New Hampshire (10-4-2) and Princeton (8-7-2) at Northeastern (9-4-2). Rensselaer  The Engineers are a team to watch as the playoffs near. They have won 9 of their last 11 games, which included Harvard's only league defeat. The defense that supports goalie Neil Little gave up more than three goals only once, a 5-2 loss to Vermont.   Rensselaer, second behind Harvard in the ECAC standing and 1 point ahead of Yale, next plays ninth-place Colgate and 11th-place Cornell at home, while the slumping Bulldogs are at Clarkson and St. Lawrence. SUNY Tournament  Plattsburgh's Cardinals, the defending Division III champions, swept through the State University of New York league with an 11-0-1 record.    Next comes a four-team tournament Friday and Saturday in a two-game format, with 10-minute mini-games to break ties. Oswego State (12-12-1 over all and 5-7-0 in the conference) plays at Plattsburgh (19-4-2, 11-0-1), and Fredonia (11-13-1, 7-4-1) visits Cortland State (17-7-0, 8-4-0). Saves  The largest regular-season crowd in college hockey history, 18,275 spectators at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena, saw Michigan rout Michigan State, 11-1, on Jan. 30. . . .

Her few works achieve a sharply individual tone, a singular blend of lyrical grace and modernist violence.    \"American Visionary\" was the tag that Cheryl Seltzer and Joel Sachs, Continuum's directors, chose for the evening. For once, the phrase applies.  Crawford makes nonsense of the standard chronology of 20th-century music. Her early works inhabit a lushly dissonant medium derived not from Schoenberg but from Scriabin.  The violin sonata of 1926, performed by Renee Jolles (violinist) and Ms. Seltzer (pianist), opens with stark dissonances but finds an ecstatic lyrical tone.

The young Italian is well trained in traditional values, but he also has the boldness to renounce usual recital fare and program newer music close to his heart. Mr. Lucchesini began on late Sunday afternoon with a rock-steady performance of Beethoven's Sonata Op. 109 and ended with Rachmaninoff's B-flat-minor Sonata firmly under control. In between came Schoenberg's Three Piano Pieces (1909) and the Six Little Piano Pieces (1911), each a milepost on the composer's way toward 12-tone philosophy. Both lay tonality aside, but the first set is generous in its vestigial Romanticism, while the second concentrates music into aphorism, some of it startlingly brief.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930224","headline":"Socialists in France, Facing Defeat, Turn Against Mitterrand","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/24/world/socialists-in-france-facing-defeat-turn-against-mitterrand.html","abstract":"  Battered by financial scandals, unpopularity and in-fighting, the Socialist Party is gambling that it can recover from an expected drubbing in parliamentary elections next month if it can pin the blame for the debacle on President Francois Mitterrand.
