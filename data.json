Proportional representation sounds like the ultimate in democracy -- no voice too small to be heard. But its great defect is that it can spawn too many splinter parties. It tends also to create a permanent class of power brokers, since national parties choose lists of candidates and winners owe nothing to their constituency, providing less accountability than in other systems.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930424","headline":"What About the First Waco Raid?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/24/opinion/what-about-the-first-waco-raid.html","abstract":"  Search warrants and other documents now reveal what Treasury Department officials have denied or obfuscated about the disastrous Federal raids on the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Tex.: The first raid, on Feb. 28, was even more misguided than Monday's F.B.I. gas attack.

The special three-performance series, which began on Thursday and ends this evening, is a remarkable event for both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Japanese theater.   In previous engagements in New York, Noh has been seen on a traditional proscenium or concert stage. Performed in the open on a raised platform in front of this Egyptian temple (built in the first century B.C.), the plays gain theatrical and historical relevance. What might have seemed exotic turns out to be the most natural linkage. In this setting, the Kanze Noh Theater conjures a feeling close to Noh's spiritual source in the 14th and 15th centuries when plays were performed at shrines.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930424","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/24/nyregion/c-corrections-966593.html","abstract":"  A front-page Critic's Notebook article yesterday about art at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington was truncated in some copies, leaving the writer's arguments incomplete.

The twist, according to investigators, was that the tickets -- $70,000 worth of them -- were purchased with pilfered credit cards or credit card numbers. Page 27.

I have a job, I'm doing something that I care about. ...     ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (High School of Fashion Industries): I have yet to accomplish success. For me, I'm successful to the point I made it -- to me. My senior year in high school; I can feel that I'm successful that I made it there. And I'm still there for the second term. But I have yet to become successful in my heart . . . because I want my college education. I want this not because society says I need it, but because I want it.      DOUGLAS KILCOMMONS, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): I just want to interject something. I am like so, I am so impressed with like Juan and Bernardo and Zaire and Wubnesh. I am so impressed with you guys. ... In my school the biggest problem with minorities is they always feel like they are like under the gun.      Q    What do you mean by that?     DOUGLAS Under the gun? O.K., well they always feel like they're the ones who are like treated differently. And in some respects that is true, and I agree with that. However, you guys are the success, the minority success story in my mind. Look, all of you expressed today some of the problems that you had earlier, but you helped yourselves. And that's why it impresses me so much. ... And that is what we have to teach everyone to do.  Even white people who are down and out and like, you know, like bums laying on the street.      ZAIRE I don't know if I agree with the student that said that black youths don't focus on education. We must be focusing on education somehow 'cause we've got our black universities filled up with college students.     SUZANNE SCHAMING, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): We have an honors program. And there is one black person I know that is in the honors program.  And I have talked to this girl on many occasions, and, once we had a Harmony Day last year, and she talked to our class.  . . . She constantly gets abuse from black people 'cause she's black and she's in the honors program. And she said she gets abuse and she gets called names. ...It's sort of like putting a stereotype on yourself and expecting everyone else to fit into that.

Three years ago, the publication of the eighth edition of Macmillan's \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" enraged a number of senior baseball writers and statisticians.

Now, the ninth edition has just arrived in bookstores and libraries, and it contains significant alterations in the numbers for such Hall of Famers as Tris Speaker, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, and Eddie Collins.\n\nMy purpose here is not to defend \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" or its editorial staff. Nor is it to address the controversial question of whether present-day scoring rules should be applied to earlier eras when different conventions of record keeping prevailed.

ON STAGE, OFF STAGE: Memories of a Lifetime in the Yiddish Theater (Harvard University, paper, $29.95), written with Irving Genn, a family friend, combines selections from Buloff's reminiscences and correspondence with the memories of his wife and leading lady of 60 years, Luba Kadison. Much of their fascinating story concerns the Vilna Troupe, the celebrated Yiddish theater company where the two began their careers. Humor, pathos and occasional hyperbole characterize the authors' descriptions of the improvisation and absurdism that were part of everyday life for Jews in the Eastern Europe of the early 20th century. When Yiddish was prohibited on the stage, actors were instructed to ad-lib in a variety of tongues, even in gibberish, if the local secret police arrived. Buloff claims to have introduced the theater of the absurd with his expressionistic production in 1925 of \"Singer of His Sorrows,\" which Eugene Ionesco told Buloff influenced his own anti-naturalistic writing style. The couple made their way to New York in 1927. They appeared with Maurice Schwartz's famous Yiddish Art Theater. They also formed an amateur theater group in Chicago and toured South America. In the 1930's, Buloff made a successful transition into American theater and film, appearing in such Broadway hits as \"Oklahoma!\" and \"My Sister Eileen.\" \"On Stage, Off Stage\" conveys, simply and directly, an engrossing tale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"That British Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/l-that-british-style-039093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In his review of \"Pandaemonium\" (April 4), Stanley Hoffmann argues that I \"confuse nationalism and ethnicity.\" Fair enough.

It was recreated in Dusseldorf in 1987 and in Los Angeles two years ago. The Los Angeles show traveled to Chicago, Washington and Berlin, everywhere provoking discussion.   But the Nazis' attack on the visual arts was just part of their broader assault on modernist culture. In 1938, a lesser-known exhibition in Dusseldorf, \"Degenerate Music,\" gave similar treatment to proscribed composers. That exhibition, too, was recreated 50 years later in Dusseldorf.

But so far, Donnie Sellers says, that has not happened to him. If it did, though, it would be understandable.   That's because Mr. Sellers is living a dual life, working full time as a police officer in Norwalk, as he has for the last 26 years, and serving in the General Assembly in Hartford. In addition, he is serving his second term on the Norwalk Common Council, is in his sixth year as a member of the city's Fair Rent Commission and is in the Army Reserve.   That all leaves Mr. Sellers, 48, with little time for sleep. \"Fortunately I'm able to get by with very little sleep,\" he said in an interview at Norwalk police headquarters. \"I'm also fortunate in that I have a tremendous amount of energy.\"   Mr. Sellers is one of two police officers in the General Assembly. The other, Edwin Garcia, a sergeant in the Hartford Police Deparment, is also a freshman State Representative and, like Mr. Sellers, has to work an all-night shift in order to serve in the legislature.   But, as Mr. Garcia pointed out, \"When I'm at the State Capitol, I'm only five minutes from home and five minutes from work.\" By contrast, Mr. Sellers lives 65 miles from the Capitol and the trip, made almost daily, takes him about an hour and 15 minutes.   Only one other police officer has served in the General Assembly, Joseph Raia of New Britain. A Democrat, as are Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia served three terms before he was defeated in a primary in his city last May.   Indeed, Mr. Raia let his State Senator know that he supported a bill to permit police officers and other municipal officials to run for office. \"I had wanted to run for the legislature for some time, since I felt that police officers in the state were being treated by the legislature as second-class citizens,\" Mr. Raia said. \"But I couldn't because municipal workers were prohibited from running in Connecticut. So I told State Senator Joe Harper of New Britain that I was all for the bill.\"   The bill passed in October 1984. And two years later, Mr. Raia, who has been a police officer for 23 years, was elected to the General Assembly.  But unlike Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia took off days without pay when he had to be at the State Capitol. \"It cost me about $10,000 a year, plus about $6,000 in overtime,\" he said. That adds up to $16,000, which is what state legislators are paid, so Mr. Raia, in effect, broke even.   Before running for a vacant seat in the General Assembly in a special election last January, Mr. Sellers sought the advice of Mr. Raia and Mr. Garcia as to the feasibility of being a combination police officer and State Representative. \"They both encouraged me,\" he said with a smile. \"But then they don't live 65 miles from Hartford.\"  A Typical Day    On a typical day, Mr. Sellers, who is divorced and the father of three sons, works from 11 P.M. to 7 A.M. in the complaint bureau of the Norwalk Police Department, then goes home to get a few hours sleep before driving to Hartford. There, he spends up to eight hours attending legislative sessions, public hearings or meetings of the House Education and Labor and Employees Committees of which he is a member. Then Mr. Sellers drives home, catches a few more hours of sleep and is back at his desk in uniform at 11 P.M. \"Fortunately, I often have my days off during the week, which makes it easier for me in Hartford,\" said Mr. Sellers, who won his seat in the special election by a 2-to-1 margin while running with the endorsements of the Democratic Party and A Connecticut Party. \"When I do and I'm tied up late, I often stay over in Hartford with friends.\"   But on other days, neither snow, nor rain nor lack of sleep keeps Mr. Sellers from making his rounds as a state legislator and police officer. For instance, during the March 12 blizzard, Mr. Sellers, rather than drive, took a bus from Norwalk to Hartford because of the storm forecast. Then at the end of his legislative day, he hitched a ride with another Fairfield County legislator in order to get back home in time for the start of his 11 P.M. shift. \"It was kind of a rough day,\" he recalled. \"But everything worked out all right.\" Not to Mention Other Commitments    Still, at times Mr. Sellers has found himself wondering just what in the world he is doing, serving two masters, the legislature and the police department, not to mention his other municipal commitments and the Army Reserves (with whom he spent a recent weekend at Camp Smith, N.Y., near Peekskill).   \"There've been some doubts from time to time, but I'm sure it's going to work out just fine,\" said Mr. Sellers, who has walked a beat, ridden in a radio car and served as a community relations officer since joining the Norwalk Police Department in 1966. \"But I don't think I'm going to seek a third term in the Council this fall and I'll probably resign from the Fair Rent Commission.\"   No one will hold that against Mr. Sellers, whose councilmanic district includes a black and Hispanic section of South Norwalk where he still lives. That is primarily because of Mr. Sellers's popularity and visibility. Over the years, he has made it a point to come to know just about everyone in his neighborhood and, it seems, thousands of other people in Norwalk. Now he is determined to become acquainted with more people in the 140th legislative district, which includes most of South Norwalk but extends as far north as the Merritt Parkway. Directing Traffic With Flair    Given his style, that should not be too difficult. Few, if any, public figures in Norwalk are as recognizable as Mr. Sellers who has a penchant for flamboyant behavior, whether directing traffic or strolling the streets.   The question arises as to how Mr. Sellers got to know so many people in Norwalk. \"It's because I've been a people's kind of cop, and I've always made it a point to reach out,\" he said. \"And I go out of my way to get to know people. I even have my phone number listed, and I always have. Not many cops do.\"   Mr. Sellers's entry into politics came about indirectly. \"I was talking with Nick DePalma, who was then running for mayor as an independent and campaigning in South Norwalk in 1983,\" Mr. Sellers recalled. \"After a while, he said to me, 'Have you ever considered getting into politics?' I told him no, and he said, 'Do you realize people have been honking their horns at you nonstop since we started to talk?' It hadn't even dawned on me.\"   Later that year, Mr. Sellers received the Independent Party's nomination for the Common Council in his district. But no one had bothered to check the Police Department's manual, which then prohibited officers from seeking public office.   \"So I went to Mayor Frank Esposito and asked him if he would please appoint me to some board because I wanted to serve the people,\" Mr. Sellers said. Subsequently, Mr. Esposito appointed Mr. Sellers to the Fair Rent Commission. \"I called the local newspaper about it and had them take my picture and put it in the paper,\" Mr. Sellers said unabashedly. \"I wanted people to know that I was on the commission.\" Critics Take Attendance    In 1989, after the legislature changed the law, Mr. Sellers became the first police officer ever elected to the Norwalk Common Council when, running on the Democratic ticket, he won in a three-way race. \"When I was approached to run, I asked myself, 'Donnie, do you have a future in politics?' And I realized I was a very powerful black candidate. So I thought, go for the gusto. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, and opportunity knocks only once.\"   Mr. Sellers was re-elected to the Common Council in 1991. But since taking his Council seat, he has been criticized, mainly by Republicans, for missing too many committee meetings. Mr. Sellers does not deny that, saying it has been because of other priorities, including his three sons. \"Missing committee meetings hasn't affected my work as a councilman, and I never miss the actual Council meetings,\" he said.   Holding down two jobs is hardly new for Mr. Sellers, who is a graduate of the University of New Haven with a degree in political science. For six years he spent five hours a day teaching troubled middle and high school students in a special program at the Benjamin Franklin School in Norwalk. And during three of those years he also directed traffic outside of Pitney Bowes on Main Avenue in Norwalk from 3 to 6 P.M. five days a week. In addition, Mr. Sellers had started a boxing club for teen-agers and established a youth organization for young people from middle-class neighborhoods.   \"Norwalk's been good to me, and I want to give something back,\" Mr. Sellers said. \"And I think I understand people because I'm a grass-roots type of person. For instance, people in my Council district aren't issue-oriented. But they're petrified because of all of the crime. When they vote, they vote for me, Donnie Sellers, not the issues.\" 'My Own Mother Was Mugged'    Occasionally Mr. Sellers patrols his neighborhood in his car or on foot on his own time, in and out of uniform. It is a low-income area, riddled by drug-trafficking and crime, much of it violent. \"My own mother was mugged in my driveway at 5:30 in the morning as she was walking toward her car to go to work,\" Mr. Sellers said. But he remains upbeat, waving and calling out to residents. \"It's bad, but I do my best to try to make things better.\"   Even one of Mr. Sellers's sons has been scarred by illicit drugs. His son Earl, who is 21, has been arrested several times on drug charges and was shot and wounded in an apparent drug dispute in Stamford last September. He has spent time in prison and at several drug rehabilitation units.   \"I even locked Earl up myself,\" Mr. Sellers said. \"Once, he even stole my gun and sold it to get money for drugs. My reaction to all of that? To get him help. It's a disease. I love Earl, and we have a good relationship.\"   Mr. Sellers recalled how stories about him and Earl appeared in the same edition of the local newspaper in February. \"My victory in the special election was on page one,\" he recalled. \"And on page 3 there was a story about Earl being arrested. It shows that these things can happen to anybody.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"THE GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/the-guide-310693.html","abstract":"  NEUBERGER EXHIBITION   In celebration of the financier-art patron's 90th birthday, 50 of the 500 works of art contributed by Roy R.

Jefferson loved classical architecture and did more than anyone else to establish its presence in America -- but he loved imagination, invention and the breaking of rules even more. How was it that a man who disdained dogma could be the moving force behind a style that is the essence of dogma? Go to Monticello and find out.

This time he's a lanky Wall Street broker who calls himself Lance, a regular guy with \"a rather extensive background in the area of diplomacy.\"\n\nRachel Swann, the feisty protagonist of \"Temptation,\" Cynthia Blair's latest novel, is not impressed at first.\n\n\"You don't look like a regular guy,\" she says. \"You look like a regular nerd.\"\n\nBut the wine, the rich food and Lance eventually get to Rachel, and she finds it in her soul to take stock of some insider information.\n\nThe rest of the plot, well, it just goes to the devil.\n'Purposely Sarcastic' Book\n\n \"Temptation,\" released this month by Ballantine and chosen for the Doubleday and Literary Guild book clubs, is Ms. Blair's first hard-cover novel, and she will sign copies on Wednesday at 8 P.M. at the opening of a Barnes & Noble bookstore in the Roosevelt Field shopping center.\n\nThe novel, with blurbs from Susan Isaacs and Anne Rivers Siddons, was hailed by Publisher's Weekly as energetic and broadly comic and ingenuously appealing. The jacket describes the book as \"a cautionary fable\" about a woman of the 90's, a single mother who juggles family and career while pursuing a romantic life. \n\nA writer of more than 30 paperbacks, about half for young adults, Ms. Blair, who lives in Sea Cliff, has a witty and irreverent style. \"My editor told me that I'm now considered to be a writer of what is called smart women's fiction,\" she said. \"It's purposely sarcastic. It holds nothing sacred and it has a bite to it.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Blair completed the manuscript two years ago, the character of Rachel was a single woman on her own. But the novelist decided to change her into a divorced, single mother. \"I felt there had to be more at stake, or else she would just seem capricious,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to Lance, the devil appears in the guises of a heavily rouged Avon lady and a callous building superintendent who flicks ashes on the carpet. In one scene the garish cosmetics saleswoman produces a small bottle of the perfume of the month, a Night in Heaven, and liberally sprays it about the room. After becoming overpowered by the horrible smell and feeling \"as if the perfume had invaded every molecule of her body,\" Rachel begins to take the Avon lady, or Auntie Agnes, into her confidence, saying:\n\n\"All my life I've been striving for things. To do things, to accomplish things, to get the things I want. And it's fun to do that, in a way. But at the same time, there's always this frustration. Frustration that comes from the fact that the whole time you're out there, doing your best, knocking yourself out, you're never really certain whether or not you're actually going to get the payoff you so badly want.\"\nUnexpected Turns in Life\n\n Many of her themes, Ms. Blair said, have to do with how people change when life takes unexpected turns.  Though Ms. Blair did not say that she had recently made any pacts with the devil, she bears other similarities to her main character. Like Rachel Swann, Ms. Blair is a writer and a single mother.\n\nAfter earning a B.A. from Bryn Mawr College and an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she began writing part-time while working as a marketing executive. Then she decided to concentrate fully on fiction. \n\n\"When I was in college I purposely suppressed the urge to write because it was such an impractical thing to do,\" recalled Ms. Blair, who grew up in North Babylon.\n\nOne snowy afternoon in Cambridge, Mass., while she was supposed to be writing her business school master's thesis, Ms. Blair was struck with the idea for a novel. In one sitting she wrote 50 pages of what turned out to be her first published book of fiction.\n\nMs. Blair's longtime editor at Ballantine, Pam Strickler, said: \"It was actually 'Close to Home,' the book prior to 'Temptation,' in which she really showed me the kind of writer she'd become. 'Temptation' confirmed it.\"\n\nNarrated in the same dryly observant voice as \"Temptation\" and set in Sea Cliff, \"Close to Home\" chronicles the life of a marketing executive who abandons her career for the rigors of being a full-time mother. The heroine finds juggling Animal Crackers and Legos even more demanding than the stressful pace of corporate life.\n\n\"I like setting reality against absurd situations because that's how life seems to play,\" explained Ms. Blair, who has signed a contract with Ballantine for two more hard-cover novels.\n\nMs. Blair cited a scene in \"Temptation\" when Rachel's boyfriend, Howard, makes a spectacle of himself at a flea market when he jokingly plants a rotating light with a suction cup atop his bald head and cannot remove it.  \"That really happened to my neighbor,\" Ms. Blair said. \"I asked him if I could use it in one of my books.\"\n\nNeither does Ms. Blair hesitate to poke fun at what she called \"the sensitive new-age man, a man who is content to sit on the sidelines and let the woman be the star.\"\n\nOne of Rachel's two sisters is encumbered by such a fellow, who in one scene is thrown into an emotional crisis when there is no unsalted butter in the house. For the sake of the sauce, he immediately rushes out to the store to replenish the supply.\n\nYet amid the humor and satire, Ms. Blair said, one lesson might be encapsulated in the axiom, \"Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.\"\n\n\"What's ironic,\" Ms. Blair added, \"is that one of the things the main character asks for is a boost in her writing career, and this is what this book is doing for me.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/nyregion/connecticut-guide-051493.html","abstract":"  FOCUS ON THE SOUND   The quality of Long Island Sound will be the focus this week of the Junior League of Eastern Fairfield County.

In February, The Wall Street Journal reported that agents were \"grabbing\" commissions as high as 25 percent while the airlines wasted away. Trade publications for the travel industry responded with editorials and articles pointing to the essential role of travel agents, who now sell 80 to 85 percent of the airline tickets in the United States, a statistic no one disputes.

Webb was charmed by the ditty. And on May 2, 1938, just a week after Fitzgerald's 20th birthday, he recorded it with her singing the vocal. Seven weeks after that session, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" was the No. 1 hit in the country. And the record, which was to be the only million-selling single of Fitzgerald's career (if you exclude a duet with the Ink Spots), became the biggest hit of 1938.

Broccoli rape is an Italian version of broccoli, with a smaller head and a slightly bitter taste. It makes a superb sauce for pasta (and is also great with Italian sausages). Fennel looks rather like a bulbous head of celery, but it has a slight taste of anise. It is sometimes called Florence fennel so as not to be confused with herb fennel.

Mr. Stein has argued often that Mr. Dinkins has let down the city's students, and perhaps even imperiled the city's future, by underfinancing the school system. \"This administration has cut more than $700 million from the Board of Education,\" Mr. Stein said at a Democratic candidates forum last week in Brooklyn. \"That's a fact.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930425","headline":"Fictions of the Self in the Making","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/books/fictions-of-the-self-in-the-making.html","abstract":"I 'VE read somewhere that women transform themselves, or set themselves on some path of achievement, only after an awakening.

My \"calling\" was to nothing more romantic than writing criticism. It was a powerful summons nonetheless, and I was undeterred in its pursuit for seven years (plying my trade in The Village Voice and Art News).

Washing from the ground up yields the best results, but rinse the areas frequently with plain water to prevent streaks. They occur if washed siding dries before it is rinsed.   Another method is to use a pressure washer, which can be rented. It consists of a gasoline-powered compressor and a variety of spray nozzles that can be attached to a garden hose.

The officers thought the weapon was a semiautomatic handgun, the police said.   The authorities were unable to identify the man, who appeared to be 35 to 40 years old. As is the case in shootings by police officers, the incident will be investigated by a departmental firearms review board and the District Attorney's office.   The shooting occurred about 10:30 P.M. Saturday on Sheffield Avenue and Wortman Avenue in East New York after the officers, responding to a report of a man with a gun, saw a person who answered the description.   When the man saw the officers approach, he ran, said Sgt. John McCluskey, a police spokesman. As they chased the man on foot, Sergeant McCluskey said, he turned in their direction with a gun in his hand, and the officers opened fire.   The man did not fire his weapon, Sergeant McCluskey said. The officers fired six rounds.   The police recovered a Daisy BB gun that resembled a semiautomatic handgun, he said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"The Road to Reconciliation With Vietnam; Live P.O.W.'s","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/opinion/l-the-road-to-reconciliation-with-vietnam-live-pow-s-126193.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   There is something disturbing in your reports on a newly found 1972 North Vietnamese document in which the Vietnamese say they hold far more American prisoners of war than they acknowledged at the time.

The eveninglong flashback to follow unfolds largely in the dank brick welfare housing of depressed northern England. The offstage band is small and tinny enough to hold forth in a garage. There is not much dancing, or, for that matter, much to dance about.   Which is just how Willy Russell, the author of the show's book, music and lyrics, wants it. First produced in London in 1983, \"Blood Brothers\" is a Thatcher-era attack on the British class system that wears its austerity on its sleeve, bourgeois frills be damned. Mr. Russell, the Liverpool-born author of \"Educating Rita\" and \"Shirley Valentine,\" would rather be sincere than slick. His musical has the rough-hewn proletarian flavor of British dramas of the angry-man era of the late 1950's and early 60's, and that authentic chips-with-everything spirit has been transferred to the snug Music Box Theater without any infusions of Broadway glitz.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"Books of The Times; Peering Behind the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas Matter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/books/books-of-the-times-peering-behind-the-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-matter.html","abstract":"  The Real Anita Hill The Untold Story By David Brock 438 pages.

Two congressmen, three borough presidents, 20 City Council members and scores of citizens have pressed the Dinkins administration in recent weeks to invoke a clause in the Mets' contract with the city to have the billboard removed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"One Fullback Waits in Brooklyn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/sports/notebook-one-fullback-waits-in-brooklyn.html","abstract":"  He could have been one of them, leaving home in East New York for midtown Manhattan and the beginning of his new life, surrounded by his family, wearing a suit and a new hat with the name of a football team.

Says It Placed Fatal Bomb; London Markets Rush to Reopen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/world/ira-says-it-placed-fatal-bomb-london-markets-rush-to-reopen.html","abstract":"  As officials scrambled to help banks and securities firms find temporary offices, the I.R.A. confirmed today that it had planted the deadly bomb that exploded Saturday in London's financial district.   Despite extensive damage to a number of buildings, officials expect financial markets to open Monday and to operate at nearly normal levels.    The bomb killed one person, wounded 44 others and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage when it went off in a parked truck in the heart of the City, as the financial district is known. Two Taxis Hijacked    Although the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility, its statement early today made no mention of two smaller bombs in London late Saturday night; they destroyed two taxicabs but caused no injuries.    The police said men with Irish accents tried to force the drivers of two cabs to drive them to their targets -- Prime Minister John Major's official residence at 10 Downing Street and Scotland Yard's headquarters -- but leaped out when the cabs were still far from their destinations. Both drivers fled before the bombs, which had been left in their cabs, went off.   If the bombings provoked one general reaction among the public, it was a sense that the Government and the police must step up their efforts against the I.R.A., which is waging a terrorist campaign to end British rule of Northern Ireland.   \"We are not getting results,\" said David Mellor, a former member of Mr. Major's Cabinet. \"The terrorists have ripped the heart out of the City of London, putting at risk lives, livelihoods and indeed the position of the City,\" he told the Press Association, a British news agency.  The Hunt for Clues    The explosion in the financial district left a 15-foot-wide crater in the street, shattered windows in dozens of buildings and sent shards raining down over several square blocks. Today the police continued a painstaking search for clues among the debris as officials sought to help banks, brokerage houses and other companies minimize the impact on their business.   \"The Prime Minister and I agreed that the best way to frustrate the terrorists is to have the City back at work tomorrow, and we are working hard to insure that it is,\" said Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor.   Thousands of workers will be unable to enter offices in the buildings that took the brunt of the blast, including the 52-story National Westminster Bank tower, which lost most of its windows, and the headquarters of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, whose lobby was destroyed. Most companies said that they were arranging for other office space and that they did not expect any major disruption. Estimating Losses    Initial estimates of the damage ran as high as $1.5 billion. But the Association of British Insurers said these estimates could prove highly inaccurate. The group noted that the initial assessment from a bomb explosion in the City a year ago, which caused extensive damage to the Baltic Exchange and nearby offices, was also $1.5 billion; the cost of repairs proved to be less than a third of that.   Some of the cost is expected to be borne by insurance companies and by the Lloyds of London insurance market. But much may fall to the Government, which agreed earlier this year to serve as an insurer of last resort for the many building owners who were finding it impossible or too expensive to get coverage against terrorism.   It was the most powerful explosion in London since an I.R.A. bomb went off in the area on April 10, 1992. Several I.R.A. attacks in recent months have been aimed at causing significant disruption as well as economic damage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930426","headline":"March for Gay Rights; Thousands From New York, Marching in a Long Gay Line","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/26/us/march-for-gay-rights-thousands-from-new-york-marching-in-a-long-gay-line.html","abstract":"  At dawn this morning, a vast southward migration began.

As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms heavier than Endeavour. Columbia also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an imaging pod on its vertical stabilizer."},{"title":"STS-55","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-55","description":"1993 American crewed spaceflight","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/STS-55_Spacelab.jpg/320px-STS-55_Spacelab.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":253},"abstract":"STS-55, or Deutschland 2 (D-2), was the 55th overall flight of the NASA Space Shuttle and the 14th flight of Shuttle Columbia.
