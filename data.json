It was an extraordinary gamble: a piece of folly, many said. But the gamble has worked.

To make his job even easier, there was a telephone in the booth, and when Michel Rocard announced he was stepping down as Socialist leader, the agent promptly called his boss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940711","headline":"New York's Minority Bidding Rule Is Void","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/11/opinion/l-new-york-s-minority-bidding-rule-is-void-637580.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your news articles on New York City's affirmative action program and its implementation (June 26 and 27) were generally consistent with what we learned in connection with two lawsuits challenging the city's price preference rule.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940711","headline":"Berlin Journal; The Elite of the Classless Society, Now Declasse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/11/world/berlin-journal-the-elite-of-the-classless-society-now-declasse.html","abstract":"  The group of slightly shabby retirees chatting outside a library in eastern Berlin one recent afternoon hardly looked like former members of an international elite, comfortable with power and at ease in the company of kings and presidents.

But Mr. Clinton was wise to defer his decision. To include countries such as Poland now invites the redrawing of lines in Europe and the start of a second cold war.   The Partnership for Peace is two things: an effort to integrate Russia into the rest of Europe, not leave it out in the cold, by developing the rudiments of collective security; and a hedge against failure, and the revival of Russian imperialism, by preparing to expand the alliance eastward.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940711","headline":"When Opportunity Knocks (Again), Branco Gets Busy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/11/sports/world-cup-94-when-opportunity-knocks-again-branco-gets-busy.html","abstract":"  His time had come and gone.

So why all the worried faces? Why have some bleak forecasts cropped up? And why does a team that possessed the elite record in baseball two weeks ago suddenly seem vulnerable?   Blame it on the 10 lousy days before the break, the 10 days that nudged the Yankees from quality to somewhat questionable.   Perhaps the numerous injuries during the last month became too much of a burden. Perhaps the tantalizing thoughts of three straight days off after 36 games in 38 days had some Yankees thinking about fun and friends instead of first. Perhaps their four-and-a-half-game lead was only a mirage because this race was supposed to be tighter. Perhaps they skidded at an inopportune time and will regroup and rectify their plummet. Meaningful Games    But by losing 7 of their last 10 games, at Yankee Stadium and against teams from the supposedly inferior American League West, the Yankees have caused fresh doubts to be dumped upon their pursuit of post-season play. In a season when they are attempting to play meaningful games in October for the first time since 1981, the Yankees had four games chopped off their lead in 10 days and escaped to their homes with a one-half game advantage over the Baltimore Orioles. The race is on.   \"I thought,\" said Luis Polonia, \"we were going to run away with it.\"   Not so fast, Luis. While Manager Buck Showalter would categorize this losing as a \"perceived trend,\" the perceptions are that the Yankees will have some concerns when they initiate the second half of the season on Thursday in Seattle. Showalter has already wondered whether Don Mattingly (tendinitis right wrist) and Mike Gallego (strained calf muscle) will return promptly and effectively from injuries. And he will probably rely on 23-year-old Sterling Hitchcock in the rotation because 31-year-old Terry Mulholland's repertory has turned into Homers-R-Us for hitters.   There is also the need for Jimmy Key to continue dazzling, for the other starters to imitate Key on his worst day; for Danny Tartabull to start dazzling and for the bullpen to remain bearable. Showalter must instill in his players that they are still the finest team in the league, or at least the best in the division, despite the sputtering. Encouraging Sign    \"To realize we're capable of better and are still in first place is encouraging,\" said Showalter, after the Yankees reached the All-Star break with a 50-35 record. \"We still have to get even better as the season progresses.\"   When the Yankees stormed ahead of the pack to grab the top record in the majors for 26 days in May and June, with Paul O'Neill hitting over .400 and Key winning virtually every start, Showalter rarely smiled. He talked about challenges and winning every series because he did not want the Yankees to think their job was complete. Although Showalter does not think the Yankees relaxed with the decent lead, he admitted that having an edge allows teams to relax. He did not have to concede that the Yankees never boosted the lead from decent to devastating.   \"When you have a four and a half or three and a half game lead, you don't play with that sense of urgency,\" Showalter said. \"When you're behind, every game creates more tension as far as making every at-bat and every day count. You can't afford to fall back.\"   The urgency has returned. With a half-game lead, the Yankees will be studying the scoreboard to see how BAL is doing. Since they snatched first place by themselves on May 9 and stretched their lead to three and a half games by May 27, the Yankees had the opportunity to forge a sizable edge and make the other teams pursue the wild card berth. But now they are one defeat from having the fourth-best record in the league.   \"At that point, you would have said everybody was going to stay behind us,\" said Polonia, recalling when the Yankees were winning at a remarkable .700 percentage. \"But we lost a lot of games and Baltimore kept winning. You still have to think of the possibility of a wild card.\" Thoughts Are Urgent    O'Neill did not mention the wild card, but his thoughts were urgent.   \"I think there's an urgency anytime you are in position to win,\" he said. \"You don't know when you're going to be in that position again. When you're in first after the All-Star break, it's a clear chance.\"   Showalter added: \"I'd rather be controlling our own destiny. I know if we win, we don't have to worry about what they did.\"   How did the Yankees forfeit the chance to make it easier on themselves?    One answer is that until Melido Perez regained his form in the last month, Key was their only dependable starter. Another is that winning 7 out of every 10 games is nearly impossible. And let's not overlook the injuries that struck, as well as the loss of their touch at home; the Yankees have lost 14 of their last 22 games at Yankee Stadium. Over all, the Yankees dropped 20 of 37 games while limping to the break.   Still, Showalter hopes this team does not mimic the club that was tied for first place a major league record 18 days in 1993.   \"We hope,\" Showalter said, \"to make Baltimore, Detroit, Toronto and Boston feel like we did last year.\" A Lot of Ifs    If the starters are sturdy, the injuries heal, the Yankees regain their earlier form and there is no strike, the second half could still be joyous for them. Jim Abbott thinks it will be. Sitting at Fenway Park two weeks ago, Abbott surveyed the lineup and told himself he was part of a special team. He saw Key, Mattingly, Wade Boggs and O'Neill and thought about first and beyond.   \"It would be nice to do something with this group of guys,\" said Abbott, who figures to leave the Yankees as a free agent after the season.   \"I'm happy to be part of this team. I want to remember these times. I want to be a part of something with these guys.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940712","headline":"The Farrakhan Sideshow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/12/opinion/the-farrakhan-sideshow.html","abstract":"Fifty years ago, the civil rights movement battled the concrete ills of legal segregation.

It had become hard to define. Who could tell what distinguished the avant-garde from the merely idiosyncratic? Or from the just plain weird?   Now in its eighth season, the Serious Fun festival, which began last Wednesday and is to run through July 30, has spawned the sort of confusion that comes with growth and change. Critics say the whole thing has gotten too serious. Or maybe that it's too much fun. In any case, as Lincoln Center, with a new director of programming, Jane S. Moss, is mulling over a restructuring of all its special-performance series, no one seems entirely certain what Serious Fun is supposed to be. And though Ms. Moss said plans for next year's festival were under way, she acknowledged that performance-art programming under the Serious Fun rubric at Lincoln Center was not immune to change.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940713","headline":"At Issue: What Is Adequate for the Poor?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/nyregion/paying-for-new-jersey-s-schools-impact-issue-what-adequate-for-poor.html","abstract":"  With today's ruling, the New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed the state's duty to provide effective schooling, not just equal spending, for all students, especially those in struggling urban districts.

The players, who have made this work a specialty in recent years, did not bear down on the four notes with portentous solemnity. Instead, after two hours of exploring Bach's inventiveness and spiritual grandeur, in a work in which themes were expanded, contracted, turned upside down, combined with themselves and their variants in an encyclopedia of possibilities, the quartet played the theme with quiet, eloquent simplicity.   The tension immediately increased; it was as if a spring were being pulled back. Two themes had already been heard in the majestic fugue. But this third, signature theme, which has long been used as a tribute to the composer (in German, B is B-flat and H is B-natural), was clearly an announcement of something more sublime than had yet been achieved. A hint of what was to come was heard as the three themes intertwined, awaiting some sort of fulfillment. Then, without warning, the first violin fell mute, the second violin followed, as did the cello, and for brief moments there were only the eighth notes of the viola, which ended in silent space. That is where Bach is said to have left the manuscript at his death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940713","headline":"Cam's Card Shark 3-2 Choice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/13/sports/cam-s-card-shark-3-2-choice.html","abstract":"  Cam's Card Shark, the leading horse in harness racing who has dominated the 3-year-old division, was installed yesterday as the 3-2 morning-line favorite over nine rivals in Saturday night's $1 million Meadowlands Pace.

The dwindling and aging membership of Congregation Derech Emunoh somehow found the wherewithal to keep it open, cherishing the moments they could spend praying in the same pews that had supported their parents and grandparents.   But the determination of its 40 members came close to exhaustion yesterday morning when an early-morning fire destroyed much of the synagogue's ceiling and roof. Fire department officials said the two-alarm blaze was suspicious in origin, and because it involved a synagogue, the case was being investigated by the police as a possible bias incident.

So they should be. But in only 11 days, 10 young women have been the victims of sexual assaults or assault attempts in New York City pools. These incidents echo a nasty trend begun last summer with \"whirlpooling,\" in which groups of young males surrounded girls and young women, rhythmically clapping and intimidating them, then assaulting them.   Betsy Gotbaum, who was Parks Commissioner at that time, insensitively referred to those incidents as \"ordinary horseplay that got out of hand.\" Mr. Stern has shown that he is taking the problem more seriously. One idea he considered, but wisely rejected, was to segregate the sexes in the pools. Rather than deprive peaceful pool users of the pleasure of swimming with whomever they choose, he has opted to hold the thugs to civilized standards.
