Now public television is circulating a one-hour version of the film. On Channel 13 at 8 tonight, it adroitly salvages the essence of the original.    Mr. Codrescu, a Jew in Romania, left the country when Israel was paying Romania to let Jews out. He arrived in the United States in the mid-1960's. For his planned car trip, he had to learn how to drive, \"adjusting my notions of left and right.\" Hopping into a red 1968 Cadillac convertible, he bravely sets off, his instincts for the outlandish at full throttle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950320","headline":"Congress's New G.O.P.

Can the Government deliver decent housing to the shanty towns that constantly remind that third- and first-world conditions are literally a stone's throw apart? Can it deliver employment to the three million blacks and 600,000 whites that the Government conservatively estimates to be without jobs?

An entire Hollywood genre, the film noir, has devoted itself to the notion that the real truth about anyone is usually sordid, that wealth is synonymous with corruption, that the fancier the closet the nastier its secrets. In \"The Devil Never Sleeps,\" Lourdes Portillo, a Chicana film maker, takes the role of cinematic gumshoe as she investigates the mysterious death of her beloved multimillionaire Uncle Oscar. Although the concept is promising, the movie's conclusions are too vague and scattered for her spadework to dig up a compelling drama.   Using vintage snapshots, old home movies and interviews, the film builds a biographical portrait of Oscar Ruiz Almeida, a Mexican rancher who amassed a fortune exporting vegetables to the United States and went on to become a powerful politician and businessman. A go-getter and a charmer, Uncle Oscar married twice. With his first wife, who died of cancer, he adopted two children. After she died, he married a much younger woman who produced two more children from artificial insemination. Unfortunately for the film, the second wife refused to appear on camera, although excerpts from several telephone conversations are heard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950320","headline":"Sheryl Crow, With Conviction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/20/arts/pop-review-sheryl-crow-with-conviction.html","abstract":"  \"I was a waitress not too long ago, and then I won a Grammy,\" Sheryl Crow said midway in her sold-out concert at the Beacon Theater on Friday evening.

If you did not get into Cornell or Brandeis or Brown University, you could always commute to N.Y.U. But the administration, doing some long-range planning, decided that being the safety school was not good enough. So in 1984, it began a brash campaign aimed at moving the school into the nation's top tier of universities. And according to academics around the country who have looked on with envy, the strategy worked. A1. NEW YORK CITY  A VIGIL FOR A SLAIN SON   Ethel Stavropoulos has been going to a Queens courtroom each day for the last three weeks, always dressed in black and bearing a photograph of her slain son. \"People should be held accountable,\" she said. \"If you do wrong, you should be accountable.\" Mrs. Stavropoulos, 81, lost her son a year ago when Lisa Bongiorno, in an alleged hallucinogenic haze, struck the car in which the Rev.

TRIPLE MURDER IN THE BRONX   A man who was apparently angry that his ex-girlfriend was seeing someone else, killed the woman and two other people by spraying the inside of her Bronx apartment with gunfire, the police said.

A HAVEN FOR CHILDREN IN BROOKLYN   In a harsh corner of Brooklyn -- where a boy speaks of not being able to erase mental pictures of his mother, face down on the pavement, the barrel of a gun at the back of her head; where schoolchildren must walk past the hollow-stare windows of crumbling buildings -- Gershwin Junior High in East New York is a haven. And Greg (Jocko) Jackson is the gatekeeper. B3. REGION  SCALING BACK MEDICAID PLANS   The Pataki administration has scaled back its ambitious plans to revamp health care for the poor, saying it will move more slowly in requiring Medicaid recipients to enroll in managed-care plans, state officials said. The administration had originally planned to enroll an additional 1.2 million poor Medicaid patients in managed care by next spring -- a plan Mr. Pataki made a cornerstone of his efforts to cut the cost of state government and particularly the increasingly expensive Medicaid program. B5. TAKING ON THE GOVERNOR OVER A DISMISSAL   Deborah I. Volberg is just about the last person you would expect to make trouble. Reserved and quiet, she speaks with such slow, deliberate care that a reporter can easily take verbatim notes. Longhand. Former bosses describe her as \"sound\" and \"level-headed\" and \"nice.\" A rabble-rouser she is not. Yet this 14-year veteran of New York state government is indeed making trouble. She is suing Governor Pataki and members of his administration for dismissing her as a lawyer in the Department of Environmental Conservation. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick, B5. CHARGE OF RACISM IN REFUSAL TO CUT HAIR   When Andrew McBride walked into Sweeney Todd Hair Design in Stamford, Conn., and asked for a trim, he was told that no one there knew how to cut his hair. So Dr. McBride, who is the city health director in Stamford, closed the shop. \"They told me nobody was available to cut my kind of curly hair,\" Dr. McBride, who is black, said. \"I went outside and hung around, and I saw a white couple go in.

They would consolidate many existing programs into block grants and chop funding by nearly $3 billion. For a system that is already overburdened and underfunded, these proposals could spell disaster.    The child welfare system is a patchwork of programs, usually run by states and counties, that protect abused and neglected children and offer services to troubled families where children are at risk. It also helps families who take responsibility for neglected and abandoned children through foster care or adoption. The system has grown as families and neighborhoods, devastated by the economy, drugs and alcohol, have disintegrated. In 1993, almost three million children were reportedly abused or neglected, an increase of 130 percent from a decade earlier. Nearly 450,000 children were in foster care.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950321","headline":"Saving Old Barns (Till the Cows Come Home)","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/21/nyregion/our-towns-saving-old-barns-till-the-cows-come-home.html","abstract":"  TO New Yorkers, this is still Sunday-drive country.

Mr. Packwood said the committee's members reached a consensus supporting huge budget cuts during a weekend retreat on the Chesapeake Bay that also was attended by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. Most at the meeting also opposed further cuts in taxes until the deficit was under control. That position puts the panel, most of whose members are middle-of-the-road politically, at odds with more conservative Republicans in the Senate and especially the House, where Speaker Newt Gingrich has endorsed a five-year package of business and personal tax cuts totaling $189 billion.   LINE-ITEM VETO: In an effort to unify members of their party, Senate Republicans unveiled a proposal to reduce the Federal budget deficit by allowing the President to veto any of the thousands of separate items in Federal spending bills. The proposal would also allow the President to veto parts of a tax bill that grant favorable treatment to a particular taxpayer or to a \"limited group of taxpayers.\" Senate Democrats called the proposal a gimmick and a dodge, forcing the President to propose what Congress cannot bring itself to do: cut pork-barrel projects out of spending bills.

The performance gave a listener no reason to challenge his assessment. Certainly the work that closed the program, Charles Wuorinen's Percussion Quartet (1994), showed that no amount of textural and rhythmic intricacy is beyond the grasp of this ensemble's young players.

The city will seek a private buyer over the next few months.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950322","headline":"U.S. Doesn't Gain by Blocking Iran Oil Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/opinion/l-us-doesn-t-gain-by-blocking-iran-oil-deal-165795.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Conoco's Deal in Iran Faces Board Hurdle\" (Business Day, March 14): The Clinton Administration's policy to isolate Iran by blocking the deal allowing Conoco to operate two large oilfields in Iran is an exercise in futility.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950322","headline":"Workers in Tiny Post Office Were Well Known to Community Residents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/nyregion/death-post-office-victims-workers-tiny-post-office-were-well-known-community.html","abstract":"  Ernie Spruill and Scotty Walensky were the men behind the window at the tiny, two-person postal station in Montclair, N.J., and everyone in the Watchung Plaza section of town knew them.   \"Ernie was talking about taking it easy just the other morning,\" said Zack Bader, the owner of the Plaza Shoppe and Deli on Watchung Avenue, just 400 feet from the post office. \"I said to him, 'Ernie, you are looking good -- you are looking very fit.'

Yet it is a distinctly visible symbol of a small migration of families from East Coast and Midwest cities and suburbs, many with no previous rural ties, to a new and quiet life in which they adopt the customs and even the religious beliefs of the Amish, other Mennonites or the most conservative of the Quaker sects, the plain Quakers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950322","headline":"Walter Cronkite With an Assessment of TV News","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/movies/television-review-walter-cronkite-with-an-assessment-of-tv-news.html","abstract":"  \"Headlines and Sound Bites: Is That the Way It Is?\" No, not entirely.
