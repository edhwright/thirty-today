While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing. When not standing still, she either paces back and forth across the stage or sits on a stool. She doesn't tell jokes. When she talks, her patter has the clunky ring of predigested interview responses.    What largely makes up for the dearth of entertainment values in Ms. Houston's shows is a voice made of steel and smoke that can send chills through an audience. And at Tuesday's opening-night performance of a Radio City Music Hall engagement that extends through Monday, that voice rang magnificently through the auditorium.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930722","headline":"Swedish Conductor Joins Manhattan School","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/22/arts/swedish-conductor-joins-manhattan-school.html","abstract":"  The Swedish conductor Sixten Ehrling has been appointed chief conductor and musical adviser to the three orchestras at the Manhattan School of Music, the school's president, Marta Istomin, has announced.

Its population peaked at about 7,000 in the 18th century, when it was a regional center. During the American Revolutionary War, the town, which by then had become an administrative center for the British Province of Quebec, was taken by the Virginia militia during the Illinois campaign. It was designated as the county seat of Illinois County, Virginia, after which it became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787. Kaskaskia was later named as the capital of the United States' Illinois Territory, created on February 3, 1809. In 1818, when Illinois became the 21st U.S. state, the town briefly served as the state's first capital until 1819, when the capital was moved to more centrally located Vandalia."},{"title":"United States Army Corps of Engineers","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers","description":"United States federal agency under the Department of Defense and a major Army command","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/USACE.gif/320px-USACE.gif","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":320},"abstract":"The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an engineer formation of the United States Army that has three primary mission areas: Engineer Regiment, military construction, and civil works. The day-to-day activities of the three mission areas are administered by a lieutenant general known as the commanding general/chief of engineers. The chief of engineers commands the Engineer Regiment, comprising combat engineer, rescue, construction, dive, and other specialty units, and answers directly to the Chief of Staff of the Army. Combat engineers, sometimes called sappers, form an integral part of the Army's combined arms team and are found in all Army service components: Regular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve. Their duties are to breach obstacles; construct fighting positions, fixed/floating bridges, and obstacles and defensive positions; place and detonate explosives; conduct route clearance operations; emplace and detect landmines; and fight as provisional infantry when required. For the military construction mission, the commanding general is directed and supervised by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for installations, environment, and energy, whom the President appoints and the Senate confirms. Military construction relates to construction on military bases and worldwide installations."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930722","time":"1993-07-22

The saxophonist Illinois Jacquet was the last of the instrumental stars of the swing era to form his own big band. It happened 10 years ago when he was invited to give a series of master classes at Harvard University and found that his students were eager to know about the big-band era, which had ended more than 35 years earlier. Drawing on his experience as a sideman in the big bands led by Lionel Hampton, Cab Calloway and Count Basie, Mr. Jacquet put together the band he has led ever since. Its performance for dancing tomorrow at the Fountain Plaza will be the last of this season's Mid-Summer Night Swing sessions at Lincoln Center. Music starts at 8:15 P.M.

At the same time, for 18 of those years she was producing elevator and supermarket music for Muzak until, in the late 1970's, she dropped these disguises and revealed herself as a jazz pianist strongly influenced by Mary Lou Williams, Earl Hines and Duke Ellington.

Guises of Golson    Benny Golson Quartet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, East Village (212) 533-7900. Benny Golson moves fast and frequently and in a variety of guises. He is a saxophonist, a composer, a band leader and a writer of scores for films and television, talents that are usually mingled in whatever he may be doing. This weekend at Fat Tuesday's, he will draw to some extent on all of his talents. He will not actually compose a film or television score but his program may include material he wrote for scores for \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Mission Impossible\" or \"Ironside\"; songs he wrote or arranged for Ella Fitzgerald, Mama Cass, Eartha Kitt and Diana Ross, and his now-classic jazz compositions (\"I Remember Clifford,\" \"Whisper Not\" and \"Stablemates\"). And he will introduce the latest in a line of groups that began in 1959, when he shared leadership in the Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet. This one is a quartet featuring a fresh talent, Kevin Hayes, on piano, and two solidly established sidemen: the bassist Rufus Reid and the drummer Marvin (Smitty) Smith. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight, 8 and 10 P.M. on Sunday. There is a $17.50 music charge and a $7 minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930723","headline":"Reviews/Art; In Connecticut, Clothes, Photos and a Yale on Yale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/arts/reviews-art-in-connecticut-clothes-photos-and-a-yale-on-yale.html","abstract":"  From Stamford to Hartford and at points in between, the summer art season in Connecticut includes a provocative look at contemporary art that uses clothing as a metaphor, an examination of the influence of the 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge, a celebration of an important university art program and a consideration of the work of an American master.

Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, cited several instances in the 1980's when the Supreme Court \"cut back on the legal protections against job discrimination.\" He then asked Judge Ginsburg to discuss her view of the Court majority's approach to construing civil rights laws in those cases.   JUDGE GINSBURG My view of the civil rights laws conforms to my views concerning statutory interpretation generally -- that is, it is the obligation of judges to construe statutes in the way that Congress meant them to be construed. Some statutes, not simply in the civil rights area but the anti-trust area, are meant to be broad charters: the Sherman Act. The Civil Rights Act states grand principles representing the highest aspirations of our nation to be a nation that is open and free, where all people will have opportunity.   And that spirit imbues that law, just as free competition is the spirit in the antitrust laws, and the courts construe statutes in accord with the essential meaning that Congress had for passing them.                    . . .         Q.  I note that in a 1979 speech at a colloquium on legislation for women's rights you stated that \"I think discrimination based on sexual orientation should be deplored.\" . . . I'd like to ask you whether you still believe, as you did in 1979, that \"discrimination based on sexual orientation should be deplored.\"   A.  I think rank discrimination against anyone is against the tradition of the United States and is to be deplored. Rank discrimination is not part of our nation's culture. Tolerance is. And a generous respect for differences based on -- this country is great because of its accommodation of diversity.    I mean, the first thing that I noticed when I came back to the United States from a prolonged stay in Sweden -- and after I was so accustomed to looking at people whose complexion was the same -- and I took my first ride on a New York subway and I thought, What a wonderful country we live in -- people who are so different in so many ways and yet we, for the most part, get along with each other. The richness of the diversity of this country is a treasure, and it's a constant challenge, too, to remain tolerant and respectful of one another.    Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, noted later that the courts had frequently deferred to military regulations far more restrictive than would be permitted in civilian law. He then referred to Judge Ginsburg's earlier testimony that she found \"rank discrimination\" deplorable and asked her precisely what she meant by the term.   A.  Yes. I think base discrimination is deplorable and against the spirit of this country -- discrimination, arbitrary discrimination without reason.   Q.  No. Does \"rank\" mean institutional discrimination? Does it mean intentional discrimination? Does it mean arbitrary discrimination? Because as I understand the Constitution, it is permissible to discriminate or to classify provided there is a rational basis for it.    A.  If I discriminated against some person for reasons that are irrelevant to that person's talent or ability, that is what I meant when I said rank discrimination: arbitrary discrimination that's unrelated to a person's ability or worth, unrelated to a person's talent; discrimination because -- simply because of who that person is and not what that person can do.   Q.  Or does? Or does? In other words, do you draw it upon that person's status or conduct? Would it be a difference, in your judgment?    A.  A person's birth status should be -- should not enter into the way that person is treated. The person who is born into a certain home with a certain religion or is born of a certain race, those are irrelevant characteristics to what that person can do or contribute to society.   Q.  What about sexual orientation?   A.  Senator, you know that that is a burning question that at this very moment is going to be before the Court, based on an action that has been taken. I cannot say one word on that subject that would not violate what I said had to be my rule about no hints, no forecasts, no previews.   Q.  Well, it seemed to me that you already did comment on that when you responded to Senator Kennedy this morning. He talked about race, religion, and gender and sexual orientation, and I think your comment was rank discrimination is deplorable under all of those circumstances.   A.  I think rank discrimination for any reason -- hair color, eye color, you name it -- rank discrimination is un-American for whatever reason. If you have a classification, there has to be a reason, as you said, for any classification.   On Capital Punishment   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, asked Judge Ginsburg whether she believed, \"as Justices Brennan and Marshall did,\" that the death penalty was incompatible with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.   A.  At least since 1976, and possibly if you date it from Furman and earlier, the Supreme Court by large majorities has rejected the position that the death penalty under any and all circumstances is unconstitutional.   I recognize that there is no judge on the Court that takes a position that the death penalty is unconstitutional under any and all circumstances; all of the Justices on the Court have rejected that view. There are many questions left unresolved. They are coming constantly before that Court. I think at least two are before the Court next year.   I can tell you that I have -- I do not have a closed mind on this subject. I don't want to commit my -- I don't think it would be consistent with the line I have tried to hold to tell you that I would definitely accept or definitely reject any position. I can tell you that I am well aware of the precedent, and I have already expressed my views on the value of precedent.    Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, cited Herrera v. Collins, in which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the majority, \"was unable to declare clearly and unequivocally that the Constitution forbids the execution of innocent people.\" He asked Judge Ginsburg, \"Do you believe the Herrera case stands for the principle that it is unconstitutional to execute an innocent person?\"    A.  As I understand it -- and the case is not fresh in my mind -- what the Court said was that the evidence in that case was insufficient to show innocence. It did not rule out a different ruling in a case with a stronger record. We heard yesterday from Senator Feinstein, who was expressing her anxiety with the number of cases that go on for years and years.   The colloquy that is occurring here is showing the tremendous tensions and difficulties in this area. Her anxious plight was there must be a time when the curtain is drawn, and your anxiety is that no innocent person should ever be put to death. Those tensions are coming before you, some of them, in the Powell Commission report that you are going to have to address.    My understanding of Herrera is it's concerned with the situation that someone could say, 10 years after a conviction and multiple appeals, \"I didn't do it,\" and then the process would start all over again. I can empathize tremendously with the concern.                    . . .         What the Court said -- and this is to the best of my recollection -- that the evidence was too slim in Herrera to make out that claim, and it left the door open to a case where there was stronger evidence of innocence. That case is yet to come before the Court in the future. So my understanding of this case is it, based on that particular record, said the evidence was too thin to show innocence, that the Court was leaving open the question of whether you could have such a plea on a stronger showing than the one that was made in that case. And that's as far as the Herrera case went. It just left open a case where a stronger showing could be made.    In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Judge Ginsburg declined to discuss her views on the death penalty because, she said, she had never decided a capital case or written about the subject. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, later reminded her that while practicing law she had written a friend-of-the-court brief in Coker v. Georgia, arguing \"that the death penalty for rape was not constitutional.\"   A.  I did not write about the question we've been addressing about the constitutionality of the death penalty. The Coker-against-Georgia brief was a brief that said the death penalty for rape, where there was no death or serious permanent injury apart from the obvious psychological injury -- that that was disproportionate for this reason: The death penalty for rape historically was part of a view of woman as belonging to man, as first her father's possession. If she were raped before marriage, she was damaged goods and she was not someone -- it was a theft of something that belonged first to the father. And if she were a married woman and she were raped, again she would be regarded as damaged goods.   We've seen that most recently in tragedies in many places in the world, where women in Bangladesh, for example, were discarded, were treated as worthless, because they had been raped. And that was what Coker against Georgia came out of, and that's the whole thrust of that brief, that this was made punishable by death because man's property had been taken from him because of the rape of women. And that was the perspective that was taken in the Coker-against-Georgia brief.    Q.  On page 22 of that brief, a heading underlined says, \"The death sentence for rape is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment because it does not meet 'contemporary standards' regarding the infliction of punishment and is inadvisable since it diminishes legal protection afforded rape victims.\" It seems to me it deals directly with the issue of the Eighth Amendment.   A.  Senator Grassley, I urge you to read the entire Coker-against-Georgia brief. I think you will find it to be exactly what I represented it to be. One of the reasons why rapes went unpunished, why women who had been raped suffered the indignity of having the police refuse to prosecute, was statutes of that order.                    . . .         I've written on the subject of women who have been raped and society's attitude toward them. Coker against Georgia fits into that category, and it must not be taken out of context to say anything about any other subject than the one that was addressed in that brief. And that was that the death penalty for rape -- the origin of that and the perpetuation of it -- was harmful to women, far from resulting in convictions.                    . . .         It was a contribution to the proper way to look at this terrible crime. It was a contribution to the end of thinking of women as damaged goods because they had been raped. That's what I think about it. On Free Expression   Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked whether freedom of expression was still an evolving right under the Constitution.   A.  Free expression, I think, was an idea from the start, even before the limitations on it -- the Alien and Sedition Act, which I think never was reversed by the Supreme Court but certainly has been reversed by the history of our country since that time. The idea was there from the beginning, -- though I mentioned the Revolutionary War cartoon, \"Liberty of speech for those who speak the speech of liberty\" -- the idea was always there. The great opposition to the government as censor was always there.   But it is only in our time that that right has come to be recognized as fully as it is today with the line of cases ending in Brandenburg v. Ohio -- truly recognizes that free speech means not freedom of thought and speech for those with whom we agree, but freedom of expression for the expression we hate. I think that there are always new contexts that will be presented but that the dissenting positions of Holmes and Brandeis have become the law that everyone accepts. I think that is the case today.   Q.  What about in the area of entertainment?    A.  Well, now we're getting into more slippery territory. It depends what kind of entertainment, I suppose. You know that the Supreme Court has a series of decisions about the speech that's in the kind of nether land between fully protected speech and unprotected speech. Indecent speech -- you have -- it's not subject to -- that is within the First Amendment but not entitled to the same level of protection as other speech.   The Supreme Court has had decisions about the -- what do they call? -- adult movie theaters, that those can be zoned for the safety of the neighborhood. They can either be -- a municipality can decide to spread them out so they won't be clustered or can put them all together in one combat zone. So there is a difference between the degree of respect of the kind of knowledge, information -- political speech on the one hand; then, as you know, there is this category of speech that is unprotected by the First Amendment called obscenity. And then there is this category of speech that's not out of the ball park but that is subject to regulation, indecent speech.   That's an area that I can't talk about in specific terms because it is something that is -- has come before my court, is coming before the Supreme Court in connection with broadcast regulation. But I do recognize that there are those -- there is that category of speech that does not get the full protection of the First Amendment but is not left out entirely.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930723","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/23/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Michael Hepher, managing director of BT PLC, is reading \"Prophets in the Dark\" by David T.

After two and one-half hours of negotiations -- broken up by lunch -- an agreement was reached on a one-year contract worth $750,000, plus incentives based on playing time and starting time, and Nagle had fulfilled his wish to be in camp in time to compete for the starting job with Boomer Esiason. Jones Is Still Unsigned    The Jets were not so successful in talks with their first-round draft pick, linebacker Marvin Jones.
