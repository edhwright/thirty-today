The new definition is expected to help both researchers and clinicians separate chronic fatigue syndrome from a host of other conditions that can cause prolonged fatigue and that would require more specific therapy.

In \"A New World Christmas,\" the program he presented on Monday evening at Gould Hall, his goal seemed to be not simply a pleasing compilation of Christmas songs but also a program that drew on the full spread of his repertory purview.   Because Mr. Cohen's field of study now runs from medieval Europe to late 19th-century rural America, accomplishing this goal within the \"New World\" scope required some sleight of hand. One could, for example, include the Spanish composer Tomas Luis de Victoria's setting of \"Ave Regina caelorum\" on the grounds that it was also sung in colonial Mexico, but that would open the door to a large part of the Old World repertory and, one would think, invalidate the theme.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941221","headline":"Nets Find Cool Way To Score A Victory","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/21/sports/basketball-nets-find-cool-way-to-score-a-victory.html","abstract":"  In accordance with the new National Basketball Association rules, forearms and elbows are not flying frequently.

This romantic adventure was in the works in 1955, until it turned out that the stars would have to be insured for $18 million in case they were chomped on by piranhas while shooting in the Amazon. The movie was scrapped before it was begun. What remained was some film of the Karaja Indians the director Samuel Fuller had taken while scouting locations in Brazil the year before.   Mr. Fuller, the director of gritty movies like \"Pickup on South Street,\" is now 82 and an idol to many young film makers. In \"Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made,\" he and the director Jim Jarmusch travel to the Brazilian village Mr. Fuller filmed 40 years ago.

Nearly 40 pieces were played, with Monday night's program at Avery Fisher Hall digging deep into Armstrong's rarely performed orchestral works and Saturday's at Alice Tully Hall working through the revolutionary early works of Armstrong and King Oliver, among others. It is difficult music, and not just for Armstrong's trumpet parts; the pre-swing rhythms are hard to make come alive, and the orchestral works, even the barest ones, were often complicated by show-biz virtuosity.   But something happened in Lincoln Center's pursuit of Armstrong: he appeared, but only in the form of a shadow, and his vague presence pointed out a great flaw in the whole repertorial endeavor. While it is clear that the music of certain historical figures -- Duke Ellington, for example -- is ideal for the modern concert hall, depending mainly on the accurate reproduction of music found on records or in scores, the process falls short for others.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"A Dublin Dreamer Confronts Reality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/movies/film-review-a-dublin-dreamer-confronts-reality.html","abstract":"Middle-aged Dublin bus conductor and Wilde's &quot;Salome.&quot; Warm little charmer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"The Neediest Cases; Opening Home and Hearts to Disabled Children","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/nyregion/the-neediest-cases-opening-home-and-hearts-to-disabled-children.html","abstract":"  In Zafar Ahmed's native country, Pakistan, neglected children are usually sent to live with relatives.

One might have expected exactly the opposite from this Pop artist, famous for recyling images from both high and low culture into pristine, expertly composed icons of style. Since Mr. Lichtenstein's painted images are so seamless and devoid of touch as to seem almost like prints themselves, it might be supposed that his prints seen in bulk might easily impress one as not only redundant but also icy cold, too far removed from the artist's already invisible hand.    But in fact, this survey of 90 works dating from 1950 to 1994, which coincides with the publication of a catalogue raisonne of his prints, gives a fuller and more textured picture of Mr. Lichtenstein's artistic achievement and his way of thinking than last season's painting survey at the Guggenheim Museum did. The reason turns out to be simple: in printmaking more than in painting, Mr. Lichtenstein found a perfect mating of medium and message and is in many ways at his most thoroughly Pop.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941222","headline":"10 Writers Win Grants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/arts/10-writers-win-grants.html","abstract":"  The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund announced 10 winners of its annual Writer's Awards on Tuesday.
