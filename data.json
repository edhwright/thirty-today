For a third night, the vehicles pulled back from the Serbian roadblock at Mali Zvornik, on the Serbian side of the border between Serbia and Bosnia, and bivouacked for the night.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"Reds' Roberts Awarded $3.9 Million Contract","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/sports/sports-people-baseball-reds-roberts-awarded-3.9-million-contract.html","abstract":"  BIP ROBERTS, a second baseman who started games at three other positions for Cincinnati last season while batting .323, was a winner in arbitration yesterday.

With Cincinnati, Roberts started games in left field and center field, and at second base and third base, and committed only seven errors.

The case simmered throughout the 1930's, and its underlying tensions are still very much with us. Edgar Nkosi White, a playwright, and Genji Ito, a composer, have built a stylized blues opera from the basic facts of the case.   The plot focuses on Clarence Norris, \"last of the Scottsboro boys,\" who lived to be pardoned by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in 1976. He is represented as a naive, wayward soul who leaves his mother and girlfriend to find work. Thrown summarily into prison, he finds himself the victim of racial hatred. He is about to be lynched when Samuel Leibowitz, constantly referred to as \"a lawyer from New York City,\" arrives on the scene. Leibowitz's defense fails, and Norris breaks out of prison rather than face a death sentence. He finds his girlfriend, Donna Lee, shows up at Leibowitz's apartment in New York and is directed to a hiding place in Harlem. The police recapture him and return him to Alabama. In a vibrant gospel epilogue, he is shown being pardoned by the villainous sheriff, who is seated in Wallace's wheelchair.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"Brazilian Sequel: A Jailbreak, a Bitter Widow","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/world/brazilian-sequel-a-jailbreak-a-bitter-widow.html","abstract":"  With the killers of Francisco (Chico) Mendes apparently on the run in Bolivia, the widow of Brazil's slain Amazon defender asserted today that the authorities had ignored repeated warnings that security was dangerously lax at the Amazon jail.   \"The authorities knew about the conditions, but they didn't take any measures,\" the widow, Ilzamar Gadelha Mendes, said in a telephone interview from Xapuri, an Amazon town 2,500 miles northwest of here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930217","headline":"2 New Studies Link Vasectomy To Higher Prostate Cancer Risk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/17/health/2-new-studies-link-vasectomy-to-higher-prostate-cancer-risk.html","abstract":"  Two large new studies being reported on Wednesday add to earlier evidence that a vasectomy may increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer.

And during an era when musical institutions have increased dependence on a class of professional administrators, the Vienna shows how strong a link can be made between musical and civic goals by handling its administration through a democratically elected committee of players.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930218","headline":"CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN: News Analysis; Taste of Harsh Medicine","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/us/clinton-s-economic-plan-news-analysis-taste-of-harsh-medicine.html","abstract":"  Bill Clinton campaigned last year on the promise of economic change.

The slickly produced revue, in which six vocalists and a rock sextet perform more than 30 songs for which Ms. King wrote the music, aspires to be little more than a choreographed concert. If it lacks the theatrical energy, imagination and wit of anthologies like \"Ain't Misbehavin' \" and \"Sophisticated Ladies,\" it offers a richly nostalgic overview of a songwriter whose work seems more traditional today than it did 20 years ago.    Ms. King had the distinction of becoming a pop star a decade after she had established herself as a successful composer of teen-age pop songs with her husband, the lyricist Gerry Goffin. Overnight, it seemed, her phenomenally successful 1971 album, \"Tapestry,\" made the frizzy-haired songwriter with a Brooklyn twang an urban earth mother for the rock generation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Part of Woman's H.I.V.

Of course, scores of Manhattan restaurants fit that description. But few have regional American food as dazzling as this place.   Considering the intricacy of its Southwestern cuisine, it is remarkable how Arizona 206 has managed to maintain such a high level of food and service over seven years (and with four chefs). Six months ago, the reins were turned over to 26-year-old David Walzog, a veteran of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan and Red Sage, a Southwestern-style restaurant in Washington. Mr. Walzog is more daring and iconographic in style than his predecessors, and he certainly runs the palate through a chili gantlet. It is also evident that his flavor combinations are devised with intelligence and care.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-94108036022.html","abstract":"Hong Kong Is Not China .

Still, an exhibition of Beuys's drawings, even one that encompasses installations and multimedia pieces as this one does, can go only so far. Seven years after Beuys's death at 64, his art remains a maze of conundrums and enigmas. And what show could do more than hint at the charismatic persona that became the essence of Beuys's work through the performances and political activities that made him world famous?   One of the canonical images of 20th-century art is surely the death-masklike image of Beuys himself: gaunt, hollow-eyed and hollow-cheeked, invariably dressed in vest and battered hat. Shaman or charlatan? For more than one generation of politically minded artists, and especially for his fellow German artists, Beuys has been regarded with a reverence matched in its ferocity only by the ridicule that has also been heaped upon him. It was part of his openness of spirit that he reacted to mockery with disarming courtesy. Among the many aspects difficult to reconcile about Beuys was that he was both a kind of megalomaniac and also virtually indifferent to art-world success in the traditional sense.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Republicans Honor Weinberger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/us/republicans-honor-weinberger.html","abstract":"  At a gathering of conservatives attended by three of the men pardoned by President George Bush for their roles in the Iran-Contra affair, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas tonight paid an emotional tribute to Caspar W.

For example, her use of schlock figures from popular culture (in her case the pathetic cartoon characters on greeting cards) preceded Jeff Koons's translation of such figures into sculpture, as demonstrated by \"Hystorical,\" a 1983 painting that hangs in the gallery's office. So it is especially painful to see Ms. Wachtel's latest efforts, which present derivative dilutions of strategies she helped formulate.    These seemingly transitional paintings suggest an amalgam of work made in the 1980's by Richard Prince, Peter Halley and the team of Wallace and Donahue. They combine hard-edge abstraction and daytime television, juxtaposing silkscreened images of faces on the afternoon talk shows with monochrome panels that are variously notched and shaped. The colors and images appear to be subtly matched, both in hue and in emotional vapidness. In \"Massapequa,\" the face of a woman with bright orange lipstick and a greenish tint is embedded in panels of bright orange and green; in \"I'm O.K., You're O.K.\" a stolid male face is framed in panels of anonymous brown and yellow. It turns out that the colors are taken from corporate logos, mall interiors and fast food restaurant uniforms.    To some extent, Ms. Wachtel's subject has always been the falseness of American life, and there is certainly no small relationship between television's canned emotions and the mindless palette of corporate America. But for the moment that relationship remains largely conceptual, more in the artist's head than on canvas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Museum Set to Lose Indian Treasure","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/us/museum-set-to-lose-indian-treasure.html","abstract":"  For years, Audrey Stevens, the curator of a small one-room museum in the town library here, treasured the museum's collection of Indian artistry: an array of beaded shirts and purses, suede leggings, wooden pipes and braided locks of human hair.

Throughout history, music and words have engaged in an amorous wrestling match. Poets take inspiration from the violin's cry, while composers build mansions to house the work of bards. In songs, whether in rock or opera, words and music alchemically blend to create an entirely new expression. The Composers' Forum 57th-Anniversary Benefit celebrates this union with an afternoon of the spoken word by writers and musicians. Participants include Susan Sontag, whose latest novel, \"The Volcano Lover,\" explores the pleasures and costs of estheticism; Lou Reed, the guitarist, singer and songwriter, who personifies New York rock-and-roll; Thulani Davis, the novelist, librettist and poet of the black experience, and Robert Ashley, the composer whose rebellious experiments have helped revitalize opera.

The career of the blues singer Jimmy Witherspoon seemed finished a few years ago after an operation for throat cancer left him only a husky ghost of his richly colored voice. But he has regained his earlier vocal powers, even adding an octave to his range. Next week he is to receive a $15,000 Lifetime Achievement award from the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation; this weekend, he gives New York a sample of his rejuvenated voice. Backed by a trio led by the pianist Bross Townsend, with John Moody on bass and Michael Carvin at the drums, he will sing at Fat Tuesday's tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $20 cover charge and a $10 minimum. Lee Konitz's Path    Lee Konitz Duo, Tishman Auditorium, the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 229-5620. The alto saxophonist Lee Konitz has followed his own personal way through jazz since the mid-1940's, sometimes paralleling current trends, sometimes taking off in new directions. In the 40's he was a follower of Lennie Tristano when most young alto saxophonists were in the Charlie Parker camp. He was in Miles Davis's \"Birth of the Cool\" group and later in Stan Kenton's big, tumultuous band. In the years since, he has been the essential flavoring in a variety of small groups. Tonight, in one of his infrequent New York appearances, he will open this season's Jazz at 6 series, playing duets with the pianist Peggy Stern. Tickets for the concert, which begins at 6 P.M., are $10 at the door. McKenna on the Green    Dave McKenna, Tavern on the Green, Central Park West at 67th Street, Manhattan (212) 873-3200. The rumbling, rolling sound of Dave McKenna's piano is being heard in the Tavern on the Green's Chestnut Room for the first time. The repertory is Mr. McKenna's usual mix of classic songs of the 1920's, 30's and 40's, but the Tavern's Hamburg Steinway Model D Concert Grand adds a special glow to his distinctive way of developing the songs. He comes to the piano tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30, and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. The music charge is $15 tonight and tomorrow, $10 on Sunday, with no minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930219","headline":"Hunt Continues for Millions Missing From Cash Courier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/19/nyregion/hunt-continues-for-millions-missing-from-cash-courier.html","abstract":"  A week after they seized the assets of a Long Island armored-car company, Federal law-enforcement officials are still trying to determine what happened to the estimated $40 million they say is missing.

Considering the intricacy of its Southwestern cuisine, it is remarkable how Arizona 206 has managed to maintain such a high level of food and service over seven years (and with four chefs). Six months ago, the reins were turned over to 26-year-old David Walzog, a veteran of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan and Red Sage, a Southwestern-style restaurant in Washington. Mr. Walzog is more daring and iconographic in style than his predecessors, and he certainly runs the palate through a chili gantlet.
