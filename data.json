In 1992, with William Bolcom as the composer, \"McTeague\" was turned into an opera. The world premiere at the Lyric Opera of Chicago was directed by Robert Altman, the longtime maverick film director, who also wrote the libretto with Arnold Weinstein.    Now, with Mr. Altman getting credit for the concept and creative supervision, there's \"The Real McTeague,\" an hourlong \"Great Performances\" presentation on Channel 13 at 9 tonight. In a kind of synthesis of forms, scenes from the von Stroheim film are blended with corresponding scenes from the opera, directed for television by Kirk Browning.

Otherwise, the opposition of many deaf people to an operation that can sometimes restore hearing seems, at best, odd or idiosyncratic. At worst, especially in the case of denying the operation to a child, it seems cruel.   In my research for a book on the history of the disability rights movement, I found that fear of the cochlear implant comes out of the deaf community's well-founded sense of oppression. It is a reaction to more than a century of belief that deafness is a sickness, to be pitied, cured and eradicated. Americans born deaf have their own language, a sign language with its own grammar and sentence structure that is quite different from English. Using it, they built a vibrant 19th-century culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930527","headline":"Entropy and the Mets: Awaiting a Big Bang","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/27/sports/on-baseball-entropy-and-the-mets-awaiting-a-big-bang.html","abstract":"  After only five games, Dallas Green had seen enough to know he had seen enough.

No other New York gallery or museum has provided new architectural ideas with such stalwart shelter.   But the 90's have challenged the identity of alternative galleries. With the loosening of post-modernism's grip on the mainstream, and the weakening of the economy that supported it, the question arises: alternative to what? No one movement dominates architecture today. Theoretical \"paper architecture,\" which once offered an alternative to conventional practice, has itself become a convention.

Grand, 76 East 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-0600. It's common practice for grungy, punkish bands to pilfer the past and rehash it with a heavy dose of irony. Steel Pole Bath Tub, from Montana via San Francisco, revives late-1960's paranoia. While bass and drums chug out a grinding, post-industrialist rhythm and the guitars sputter and shriek feedback and distortion, Michael Morasky, one of the band's three singers, spins grim tales that read like James Ellroy on acid. In \"594,\" from the band's latest album, \"The Miracle of Sound in Motion\" (Boner Records), a psycho sits in the window of his room with a gun pointed at the street; in \"Bozeman,\" a staticky voice whispers, \"They got your mind controlled.\" Steel Pole Bath Tub's malice is just understated enough not to seem silly, and the grooves are deep and tight. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 day of show. Also Sunday night at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Show is at 9 P.M.; tickets are $6. Electric Romanticism    Springhouse, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Ever since the late 1970's, British bands from the Buzzcocks to Felt to Jesus and Mary Chain have toyed with the process of doctoring pop hooks with thick layers of electric guitar. Springhouse, from New York City, updates the formula with a new romanticism. On \"Postcards From the Arctic\" (Caroline), the band's latest album, the vocalist Mitch Friedland sings with supreme detachment, as if he wants to look down on his angst from above. The melodies are pretty and wistful, the sentiments dizzying and sad; at its best, as in \"Asphalt Angels,\" Springhouse captures and holds onto a fleeting sense of melancholy. Tonight at 10. Admission is $6. Brooklyn Blues    The Senders, Sideshows by the Seashore, Boardwalk at West 12th Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 372-5159. One of the few New York bands to have survived the rigors of the 1970's and 80's, the Senders still bash out a classic blend of blues, rhythm-and-blues and ornery attitude that long ago crystallized into the first wave of punk rock. The brawny, no-nonsense approach and dedication to tradition seems almost innocent when compared with today's young punks, the way 60's soul seems innocent compared to hip-hop; it's a style that lingers outside the mainstream, a little bit tougher than time and trends. Tonight at 10. Admission is $6.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930528","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/arts/art-in-review-225493.html","abstract":"  'James Brooks' 'The 1950's'   Joan T.

Josephina Howard, the chef and co-owner, is an enthusiastic proponent of regional Mexican cuisine, and her diverse menu reflects that. You will not encounter any jalapeno Alamos at Rosa Mexicano. Dishes are highly seasoned but rarely fiery. If one criticism can be made about the menu, it is that dishes rarely change. Daily specials aside, the lineup today is for the most part the same as when the restaurant was reviewed in 1990. And that review remarked: \"The menu has not changed much since my last review in 1986.\" Sticking to a winning formula makes sense, to be sure, but at the same time one expects innovation from a restaurant of this caliber.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930528","headline":"South Africa Frees 43 Blacks Seized in Crackdown","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/south-africa-frees-43-blacks-seized-in-crackdown.html","abstract":"  The police today released 43 black militants arrested two days ago in a crackdown on the Pan Africanist Congress, conceding that they did not have evidence linking them to specific crimes.

And fancy restaurants with their wood-burning ovens have trumpeted the cause of the individual pizza, a dainty invention requiring the use of a knife and fork, sacrilege to self-respecting slice eaters from the fold-and-devour school.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930528","headline":"What they're reading","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Colin Wilson, the writer, who is one of the original \"Angry Young Men,\" is reading John McCrone's \"The Myth of Irrationality:The Science of the Mind From Plato to Star Trek.\". \"A most infuriating book that argues that the human","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930528","headline":"Thieves Refine Tactics As Tourism Flourishes : Traveler, Beware, You're a Target","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/style/IHT-thieves-refine-tactics-as-tourism-flourishes-traveler-beware-youre.html","abstract":"LAST month's robbery and murder of a German woman vacationing in Florida has galvanized public awareness that tourists who are unfamiliar with their surroundings can be the most likely victims of crime..

It involves the American sculptor Beverly Pepper and the Boston landscape architect Martha Schwartz, and the new scheme comes with the neighborhood seal of approval.   Four years have passed since the furor over Richard Serra's \"Tilted Arc,\" the monumental steel sculpture that bisected the space in front of 26 Federal Plaza from 1981 to 1989. After a prolonged and heated artistic battle that involved the plaza's tenants and neighborhood residents, the 12-foot-high, 112-foot-long piece was proclaimed by the agency to have rendered the plaza unusable. In 1989 the work was dismantled and removed, an act that the artist said was tantamount to destroying it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930528","headline":"To the Beach: A Baedeker for Baskers; Manor Beach","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/arts/to-the-beach-a-baedeker-for-baskers-manor-beach.html","abstract":"  It has been a long time now since Larchmont in Westchester County was a summer community, but if you stand on Manor Beach and look out over the rocks to the green flank of Long Island, it is still possible to imagine Jay Gatsby gazing back.

Other beaches may aspire to the natural look; Manor Beach evokes a time when Nature was something to be improved upon, trussed and manicured and, if need be, rearranged.
