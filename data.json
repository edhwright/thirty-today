A governess has come to an isolated English estate to care for two children. She soon suspects that they have been sexually corrupted by her predecessor and a manservant, both of whom have died, both of whom seem to have returned as ghosts to haunt their once innocent charges. The composer and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, undercut the ambiguity cultivated by James; in the opera these ghosts are as real as their corruptive effects. At the beginning of the second act they triumphantly sing a line from Yeats: \"The ceremony of innocence is drowned.\"   But from that moment on, as the opera proceeds through its compact, beautifully orchestrated scenes, ambiguities begin to accumulate and the work itself begins to seem a strange ceremony of innocence. We begin to doubt some perceptions of the Governess, whose melodic lines echo and anticipate the singing of the demonic servant, Quint. The score, which turns church bells ominous and nursery rhymes into signs of corruption, sometimes seems as if it is being strained through the Governess's psyche. Britten's ceremony marks not the dissolution of innocence in the children, but the growth of an uncertainty that innocence is even possible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940422","headline":"1894:Cholera in Portual : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/opinion/IHT-1894cholera-in-portual-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"During several months, a number of young diplomatists attended at the Quai d'Orsay where they discussed measures to be taken to prevent the development of cholera.

Using Coast Guard cutters to turn back Haitians trying to flee their violent and tormented country is cruel and discriminatory.    U.S. law requires a hearing for anyone claiming asylum.

One can even overlook the fact that they promoted a soap that practically tore the skin off your body.\" Ah, the unknown Bergman. He is everywhere in \"Images: My Life in Film,\" a series of wry, lucid, ofter harsh reflections on his life's work that was published in Sweden in 1990 but appeared in English translation only three months ago.    New though it is, \"Images\" is not the most recent of Mr. Bergman's books to appear here, and it is certainly not the last word on the little Ingmar, \"considered sullen and too sensitive.\" It is not easy to keep up with his literary output since he stopped directing feature films in 1982.    \"Sunday's Children,\" an exquisite autobiographical film about his boyhood, was written by Mr. Bergman and directed by his 32-year-old son, Daniel. It is now at the Film Forum in the South Village. And Ingmar Berman's novel of \"Sunday's Children\" has just been published as well. In the hands of most former film makers, the novel might be a watered-down version of the movie. But \"Sunday's Children\" is as elegant, honest and emotinally brutal as \"Fanny and Alexander\"; though its scope is slender, this brief novel is a perfectly shaped treasure that stands among the finest work of Mr. Bergman's career.    The freshness of \"Sunday's Children\" in both forms is amazing, because Mr. Bergman has written this story before. It exists nearly whole, in subject and shape, in the next-to-last chapter of \"The Magic Lantern\" (1987), the first of the autobiographical books that have made Mr. Bergman, now 75, one of the most alluring writers of recent years.    In \"The Magic Lantern,\" one July the young Ingmar accompanies his father, Erik, from their country house to a nearby village where Erik Bergman, a minister, is to preach. Ingmar is a Sunday's child, according to folklore, able to see fairies and other visions. He takes the trip with his father by ferry and bicycle, and recalls seeing in the church a stained-glass window depicting \"Death leading a dance to the Dark Lands, wielding his scythe like a flag.\" - a picture that would become the final scene of \"The Seventh Seal\" and one of the most famouse Bergman images of all. Comically, Ingmar's older brother, Dag, promises to pay him for eating a live worm, then reneges on the offer after the boy with the notoriously fussy stomach has swallowed the creature. These are major incidents in \"Sunday's Children,\" too.    More striking, that chapter in \"The Magic Lantern\" includes flashes forward in time to the adult Ingmar Bergman visiting his elderly, widowed father. Their relationship is one of fear, anger, coldness. In expanded form, those forward flashes become the harsh emotional underside of the lyrically beautiful \"Sunday's Children,\" on screen and on the page.    \"I am forever living in my childhood,\" Mr. Bergman writes in \"Images.\" As the details of those July days echo from memory through \"The Magic Lantern\" on to \"Sunday's Children,\" they hold the key to the art of Mr. Bergman's memoirs. He keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audience in dazzling new shapes.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" the young Ingmar is an 8-year-old called Pu (on screen played by the golden-haired, wide-eyed Henrik Linnros). He is a serious child who both loves and hates his father and is already troubled by the idea of death. When film and novel flash ahead to 1968, the 50-year-old Ingmar is still angry and intransigent on his visits to Erik. In a dizzying swirl of connections between father and son, the middle-aged Ingmar isplayed on screen by Per Myrberg, who looks nothing like the real Mr. Bergman. But his father is played by Thommy Berggren, who as he ages looks quite a bit like Ingmar Bergman today.    Judging the adult Ingmar harshly, Mr. Bergman has made \"Sunday's Children\" a huge gesture of reconciliation to his now-dead father. It is also a great gift to his son. (It is easy to speculate that Mr. Bergman's ramshackle personal life, with eight children spread among four wives and one lover, might make usch gestures especially prized.) Daniel Bergman mad children's films and worked for television before filming \"Sunday's Children,\" his first feature. When the project was conceived, father and son agreed that Ingmar would write without consulting his son, and Daniel would direct without his father's help. Ingmar Bergman stayed away from the set of \"Sunday's Children.\"    The importance of teh screenplay is suggested gy the vast difference between \"The Best Intentions,\" the rich, trenchant 1991 film about his parents that was written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by Bille August, and the sprawling fiasco of \"The House of the Spirits,\" the current film written and directed by Mr. August. Only the luxurious scenery in those two films is similar.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" too, capturing the graceful picturesque quality of two days in the country is the easy part. Daniel Bergman's cinematographer, Tony Forsberg, even substituted for Sven Nykvist on \"Fanny and Alexander\" for a few weeks when Mr. Nykvist got the flu.    But Daniel Bergman has done more than create a pretty film that echoes his father's lyricism. Daniel and his actors capture the tormented emotions beneath the picturesque summer in the country. Pu is a darling, sympathetic little boy. \"Shut your mouth, Pu,\" his Uncle Carl says. \"You look stupid with you mouth open.\" The comment is repeated by Pu's nanny and by Day, but you have to return to \"Magic Lantern\" to discover why Pu's mouth is always gaping. Adenoid probglems caused the young Ingmar to breathe through his mouth, \"which made me look stupid,\" Mr. Bergman writes.    Pu is also preternaturally serious, like the famously humorless little Ingmar. Both film and novel rely on his relentless questions. Pu keeps asking \"What?\" like a nervous tic. When a servant tells a ghost story about a local watchmaker who hanged himself, the tale becomes a fantastic set piece on the page and an eerie black-and-white vision on screen. The watchmaker kills a demonic gradfather clock and a small, fully formed woman who lives inside it. Later, Pu goes to the place where the watchmaker killed himself and asks in a dream, \"When will I die?\" The watchmaker answers, \"Always,\" and idea that the film maker has carried with him throughout his career.    Similar though the two versions of \"Sunday's Children\" are, each makes a unique contribution to the grand mosaic of the Bergman biography. On screen, the adult Ingmar's coldness is more visceral; in the novel the connections between past and present are stronger and more resonant.    When Pu sits on the edge of the ferry and dangles his feet in the water, his father swats him on the head in fury, which leads directly to a flash forward. \"What did I do wrong?\" the aged father asks, having discovered his dead wife's diaries, which call their marriage \"a life-fiasco.\" The adult Ingmar coldly, even cruelly, tells his father how frightened the family was of his anger. Then he walks away. The scene returns to Pu and his father, who apologizes for pulling the child away from his dangerous perch on the ferry so violently. \"I was scared,\" he says. \"When you're scared, you get angry.\" The explanation goes back to \"The Magic Lantern\" and to the heart of the Bergman family's anger and unhappiness. Pu, having overheard his parents arguing, fears that his father will leave; Erik fears losing his wife; over the years, Ingmar's anger becomes implacable.    Mr. Bergman deftly positions his leaps in time to reflect backward and forward, so the present illuminates the past and the past explains the present. On screen, when the camera returns from 1968 to Pu's boyhood, the flashes forward almost seem to have been prophetic visions of this Sunday's child. On the page, the effect is the opposite, as the voice of Ingmar Bergman today is heard shaping his past.    On their way home from the sermon, Pu and his father are caught in a storm. The father puts his coat around Pu, and the story jumps ahead to Erik Bergman's deathbed. Erik whispers a blessing on his son, who is unable to understand what his father is mumbling. As the story returns to the past. Erik once more puts his coat around Pu, echoing the gesture of blessing. \"Sunday's Children\" itself is a blessing that Ingmar Bergman has bestowed on Daniel. This son had the good sense and talent to appreciate the gift and turn it into an enduring Bergman film.

He established the character-driven western with his classic \"Stagecoach\" in 1939, and by 1956 was probing the moral ambiguities of the frontier in \"The Searchers,\" a film that seems deeper with every viewing. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Ford's birth, the Museum of Modern Art is presenting \"John Ford, 1894-1973: An American Master,\" a series of films from the museum's collection that will run through May 6.    This weekend's highlight is a new print of \"The Searchers.\" Beloved by western fans and cineastes, this is the John Wayne movie for people who think they don't like John Wayne. As Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier, Wayne goes on an obsessive yearslong search for his niece (Natalie Wood; even Ford wasn't perfect at casting), who had been abducted by Indians. When he finds her, all his certainty about good and evil -- and all moviedom's certainty about cowboys and Indians -- is subjected to fierce moral scrutiny.

In \"The Magic Lantern,\" one July the young Ingmar accompanies his father, Erik, from their country house to a nearby village where Erik Bergman, a minister, is to preach. Ingmar is a Sunday's child, according to folklore, able to see fairies and other visions. He takes the trip with his father by ferry and bicycle, and recalls seeing in the church a stained-glass window depicting \"Death leading a dance to the Dark Lands, wielding his scythe like a flag.\" - a picture that would become the final scene of \"The Seventh Seal\" and one of the most famouse Bergman images of all. Comically, Ingmar's older brother, Dag, promises to pay him for eating a live worm, then reneges on the offer after the boy with the notoriously fussy stomach has swallowed the creature. These are major incidents in \"Sunday's Children,\" too.    More striking, that chapter in \"The Magic Lantern\" includes flashes forward in time to the adult Ingmar Bergman visiting his elderly, widowed father. Their relationship is one of fear, anger, coldness. In expanded form, those forward flashes become the harsh emotional underside of the lyrically beautiful \"Sunday's Children,\" on screen and on the page.    \"I am forever living in my childhood,\" Mr. Bergman writes in \"Images.\" As the details of those July days echo from memory through \"The Magic Lantern\" on to \"Sunday's Children,\" they hold the key to the art of Mr. Bergman's memoirs. He keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audience in dazzling new shapes.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" the young Ingmar is an 8-year-old called Pu (on screen played by the golden-haired, wide-eyed Henrik Linnros). He is a serious child who both loves and hates his father and is already troubled by the idea of death. When film and novel flash ahead to 1968, the 50-year-old Ingmar is still angry and intransigent on his visits to Erik. In a dizzying swirl of connections between father and son, the middle-aged Ingmar isplayed on screen by Per Myrberg, who looks nothing like the real Mr. Bergman. But his father is played by Thommy Berggren, who as he ages looks quite a bit like Ingmar Bergman today.    Judging the adult Ingmar harshly, Mr. Bergman has made \"Sunday's Children\" a huge gesture of reconciliation to his now-dead father. It is also a great gift to his son. (It is easy to speculate that Mr. Bergman's ramshackle personal life, with eight children spread among four wives and one lover, might make usch gestures especially prized.) Daniel Bergman mad children's films and worked for television before filming \"Sunday's Children,\" his first feature. When the project was conceived, father and son agreed that Ingmar would write without consulting his son, and Daniel would direct without his father's help. Ingmar Bergman stayed away from the set of \"Sunday's Children.\"    The importance of teh screenplay is suggested gy the vast difference between \"The Best Intentions,\" the rich, trenchant 1991 film about his parents that was written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by Bille August, and the sprawling fiasco of \"The House of the Spirits,\" the current film written and directed by Mr. August. Only the luxurious scenery in those two films is similar.    In \"Sunday's Children,\" too, capturing the graceful picturesque quality of two days in the country is the easy part. Daniel Bergman's cinematographer, Tony Forsberg, even substituted for Sven Nykvist on \"Fanny and Alexander\" for a few weeks when Mr. Nykvist got the flu.    But Daniel Bergman has done more than create a pretty film that echoes his father's lyricism. Daniel and his actors capture the tormented emotions beneath the picturesque summer in the country. Pu is a darling, sympathetic little boy. \"Shut your mouth, Pu,\" his Uncle Carl says. \"You look stupid with you mouth open.\" The comment is repeated by Pu's nanny and by Day, but you have to return to \"Magic Lantern\" to discover why Pu's mouth is always gaping. Adenoid probglems caused the young Ingmar to breathe through his mouth, \"which made me look stupid,\" Mr. Bergman writes.    Pu is also preternaturally serious, like the famously humorless little Ingmar. Both film and novel rely on his relentless questions. Pu keeps asking \"What?\" like a nervous tic. When a servant tells a ghost story about a local watchmaker who hanged himself, the tale becomes a fantastic set piece on the page and an eerie black-and-white vision on screen. The watchmaker kills a demonic gradfather clock and a small, fully formed woman who lives inside it. Later, Pu goes to the place where the watchmaker killed himself and asks in a dream, \"When will I die?\" The watchmaker answers, \"Always,\" and idea that the film maker has carried with him throughout his career.    Similar though the two versions of \"Sunday's Children\" are, each makes a unique contribution to the grand mosaic of the Bergman biography. On screen, the adult Ingmar's coldness is more visceral; in the novel the connections between past and present are stronger and more resonant.    When Pu sits on the edge of the ferry and dangles his feet in the water, his father swats him on the head in fury, which leads directly to a flash forward. \"What did I do wrong?\" the aged father asks, having discovered his dead wife's diaries, which call their marriage \"a life-fiasco.\" The adult Ingmar coldly, even cruelly, tells his father how frightened the family was of his anger. Then he walks away. The scene returns to Pu and his father, who apologizes for pulling the child away from his dangerous perch on the ferry so violently. \"I was scared,\" he says. \"When you're scared, you get angry.\" The explanation goes back to \"The Magic Lantern\" and to the heart of the Bergman family's anger and unhappiness. Pu, having overheard his parents arguing, fears that his father will leave; Erik fears losing his wife; over the years, Ingmar's anger becomes implacable.    Mr. Bergman deftly positions his leaps in time to reflect backward and forward, so the present illuminates the past and the past explains the present. On screen, when the camera returns from 1968 to Pu's boyhood, the flashes forward almost seem to have been prophetic visions of this Sunday's child. On the page, the effect is the opposite, as the voice of Ingmar Bergman today is heard shaping his past.    On their way home from the sermon, Pu and his father are caught in a storm. The father puts his coat around Pu, and the story jumps ahead to Erik Bergman's deathbed. Erik whispers a blessing on his son, who is unable to understand what his father is mumbling. As the story returns to the past. Erik once more puts his coat around Pu, echoing the gesture of blessing. \"Sunday's Children\" itself is a blessing that Ingmar Bergman has bestowed on Daniel. This son had the good sense and talent to appreciate the gift and turn it into an enduring Bergman film.

It slights neither the disturbing darkness of the play's first acts nor the sunny ebullience of the pastoral scenes, but it leavens each with comic and potentially tragic elements that inextricably link the two parts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940422","headline":"Home Video","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/arts/home-video-861804.html","abstract":"  Creating Demand    Above all a marketing operation, home video saves its best creative thinking for moving product.

Even as she moves into her 70's, the pianist Dorothy Donegan remains one of a kind. As a child, her skills so impressed the great jazz pianist Art Tatum that he gave her lessons, and she can still keep listeners on the edges of their seats with her unpredictable roller-coaster rides, which draw on whatever crosses her mind. Even her longtime New York accompanists -- the bassist Jon Burr and the drummer Ray Mosca -- often seem in danger of falling off the Donegan Express. Although no longer as volcanic as she once was, Miss Donegan still has a strong stomping foot that pounds home the beat to even a casual listener. She plays tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45 and Sunday night at 8:15 and 10:15. The music charge is $23.50 tonight and tomorrow night, $17.50 on Sunday. There is no minimum. JOHN S. WILSON Back to an Old Stand    Barbara Carroll, Bemelmans Bar, Hotel Carlyle, 76th Street and Madison Avenue, (212) 744-1600. Barbara Carroll is now in her 16th season of playing piano surrounded by the drawings of Ludwig Bemelmans, in a room that was named for the cartoonist and musician long before Miss Carroll arrived there. Earlier, in the 1950's, she had established another room as her home base: the Embers on 52d Street when it was known as Swing Alley. Despite these long runs, her playing has remained fresh and adventuresome; she has moved through new areas of jazz after starting as a be-bop disciple of Bud Powell and has also extended her performances to reveal a warm singing personality. She plays and sings tonight and tomorrow night from 9:45 until 12:45 A.M. There is a $10 music charge but no minimum. J. S. W. Drummer-Influenced Sax    Richie Cole Quintet, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. The fact that the alto saxophonist Richie Cole has been influenced by both the drummer Buddy Rich and another alto player, Phil Woods, accounts for much of the power of his virtuoso style. From 1969 through 1972, he was in Buddy Rich's Big Band, a group that carried out explosive ideas set off by Mr. Rich's drums. The influence of Phil Woods started in Cole's high school years, providing a basis for the saxophonist's lively, positive attack. His current quartet is made up of Bobby Enriquez on piano, Vic Juris on guitar, Ed Howard on bass and Vic Jones on drums. Shows tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10 and midnight; on Sunday, at 8 and 10. There is a $20 cover charge and a $10 minimum. J. S.

Like Lapidus, the legendary designer of Miami Beach hotels, Mr. Tschumi has an uncommon flair for glamorous architectural images. But he has managed to hobble this talent by styling himself as a cultural revolutionary. Like Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus, Mr. Tschumi seems to think that his designs can alter the reality as well as the look of urban life. Unfortunately, to judge from \"Bernard Tschumi: Architecture and Event,\" a show of six projects now on view at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Tschumi has come to feel that the look of things has taken reality's place.   Unlike many architecture shows, where the main event -- the building -- is missing, this one, organized by Terence Riley and Anne Dixon, puts Mr. Tschumi's best face forward. The Swiss-born architect, dean of the architecture school at Columbia University since 1988, has built only one major project to date, the 165-acre Parc de la Villette in Paris, shown at the museum in a model, drawings and photographs. Otherwise, his work (surveyed in a hefty 634-page book, published by MIT Press to coincide with the exhibition) has been largely confined to paper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940422","headline":"New View of Peril From A-Plant Emissions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/us/new-view-of-peril-from-a-plant-emissions.html","abstract":"  A team of Government-sponsored scientists said today that deliberate releases of radiation four decades ago from the Hanford nuclear weapons plant in southeast Washington exposed thousands more people over a much larger region than previously thought.

With Verdi or Wagner operas, one might quibble about editions and details, but the composers' fully orchestrated scores are solid foundations on which performances can be built. But with Monteverdi and his contemporaries, surviving scores present the music in shorthand, with instrumentation and scoring niceties left to circumstance, and fragments of competing versions clouding the picture. The questions \"What should be done here?\" and \"How?\" can be daunting for musicians used to being guided by the composers' expressed wishes.    The student singers and musicians of the Juilliard Opera Center have been puzzling over Monteverdi's 1642 opera, \"L'Incoronazione di Poppea,\" with musicological prodding from Gary Wedow (who, in turn, based his realization on Alan Curtis's 1990 edition of the work) and staging by Frank Corsaro.

A few weeks ago it put on a catastrophic blues program, a misguided collection of players and pejorative ideas about blues that indicated those in charge didn't have much of a grasp of who is capable of what in the jazz world. Not a good thing for a jazz series. Then along comes Thursday night's concert, \"The New Legacy,\" which did what the jazz program has done best: introduce unheralded, talented arrangers; allow gifted improvisers room to sell their wares, and let a fine big band roar.   The show was meant to pair young musicians with older ones, and it opened with \"New Orleans Joy,\" a piece by the trumpeter and arranger Randy Sandke that brought together four tunes loosely associated with the city of the title. He was joined by three other trumpeters, Doc Cheatham, Nicholas Payton and Jon Faddis. Mr. Sandke is one of the more miscast musicians working in jazz. He's often written off, unfairly, as a swing revivalist. But he can play virtually any jazz idiom, and as an arranger he brought modernist dissonances, bitter and astringent, to the piece. He also flashed lush reed writing, and roiling, shouting polyphony.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"New York:Spring Brings Out The Buyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/your-money/IHT-new-yorkspring-brings-out-the-buyers.html","abstract":"TAKE THE real-estate broker's maxim, \"Location, location, location.\" Add to that, \"Bigger is better\" and you have a snapshot of where the current action is in Manhattan's apartment market..A glance at a recent survey of co-op apartme","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19940423","headline":"Faces Turned to Crimson; Strike at Harvard Club Is Embarrassing, at the Least","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/nyregion/faces-turned-to-crimson-strike-at-harvard-club-is-embarrassing-at-the-least.html","abstract":"  Predictability is a cherished hallmark of a good city club.

You assume insurance companies are interested in providing cost-effective, good-quality care. My experience as a practicing psychologist tells me otherwise. Insurance companies are indeed motivated to minimize costs (that is, benefits paid out) -- this increases profits. But they have no incentive to maximize quality -- that often costs money. The result is that they often exclude highly trained and experienced providers who they think may prescribe more expensive treatment, and allow in mediocre practitioners who they think will be more compliant with the company's wish to save money. Similarly, \"medical necessity,\" the standard by which the companies determine whether to pay for treatment, is generally defined in a highly restrictive and self-serving way.

The Met, on the other hand, might borrow the Kirov's chorus for productions of Russian works.   \"This started out over lunch,\" Mr. Volpe said, \"when Gergiyev began explaining to me all of the financial problems the Kirov was facing, and how hard pressed they are to keep things going.

Thousands of bodies have already piled up, and the killing continues despite the presence of 1,700 United Nations peacekeepers. The wider horror is that the world has few ways of responding effectively when violence within a nation leads to massacres and the breakdown of civil order.    The U.N. Security Council threw in the bloodied towel when it decided unanimously Thursday to cut back the blue-helmeted force to 270 soldiers in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.

How will it play for children, who were after all the audience that made \"Beauty and the Beast\" a hit? And what if those children only have milk money, not the $65 needed for a seat in the orchestra?   Bear in mind that a family outing for four can cost $260 -- maybe more, if you don't make it past the $45 sweatshirts and $20 audiocassettes at the souvenir stand. Can this experience possibly be worth 13 times as much as a \"Beauty and the Beast\" videotape, which also happens to be the more enduring purchase? Believe me, even a 5-year-old can do the arithmetic on that one, especially a 5-year-old who loves the film.
