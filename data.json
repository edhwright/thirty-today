In an early encounter, she strode into the 1981 county budget hearing Mr. O'Rourke presided  over followed by nearly 1,000 parents. Ms. Ziegler's group testified past midnight, a filibuster of sorts, which prompted Mr. O'Rourke, then head of the County Board of Legislators, to return $1 million the Board had originally cut from the child-care budget. \n\n     If his budget balancing efforts were stymied by Ms. Ziegler at the time, all  is now forgiven. As master of ceremonies for her retirement dinner, Mr. O'Rourke praised Ms. Ziegler, who left the helm of the Westchester Child Care Council at  the end of 1995, for her tenacity. Sometimes on opposite ends of issues, Mr. O'Rourke said she had been a hard person to say no to.

Soon they and their acolytes --  Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Shirley MacLaine -- were known as the Clan, a phrase later dropped because it seemed too evocative of that other Klan.

Mr. Sinatra conducted  the orchestra for Martin's new album, \"Sleep Warm,\" and joined him onstage for the first time at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. Soon they and their acolytes --  Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Shirley MacLaine -- were known as the Clan, a phrase later dropped because it seemed too evocative of that other Klan.

This is far too hyperbolic a statement. Ms. Doerr does have a  sure and elegant hand when it comes to describing flora and fauna and the houses in California and Mexico where she has lived. But with her keen attention to detail in matters of character and emotion, she demonstrates a compassionate spirit that is anything but evil. Using an episodic structure similar to those in her novels, \"Stones From Ibarra\" and \"Consider This, Senora,\" this new book allows Ms. Doerr to contemplate certain events from the nearly nine decades of her life, even as she returns us to the locales made familiar in her fiction. Writing with admirable simplicity, she recalls spending sublime childhood summers at the beach, knitting a muffler for an American soldier in France (who  sent her a much-cherished thank-you note) and going off to Smith College in 1927. There are also memories of being widowed at 65 after 42 years of marriage  and then going back to college, and of helplessly standing by as her son began to succumb to cancer. Several of the short stories, set in Ibarra, reacquaint readers with Sara and Richard Everton, who were introduced in Ms. Doerr's first  book. Others explore different parts of rural Mexico. Like the matilija poppies  of Ms. Doerr's youth, \"whose crushed tissue-paper petals unfolded every June into white flowers as big as a child's face,\" these previously uncollected short works are strikingly pure and radiant.

So Madonna, the pop superstar, failed to persuade a Los Angeles Superior Court judge that her desire to avoid fulfilling the fantasy of the man charged with stalking and threatening to kill her outweighed his right to share time in the courtroom with her. As a result, she reluctantly went to court and testified last week against Robert Dewey Hoskins, who faces criminal charges of stalking, making terrorist threats and assault. She had asked that the defendant be removed from the courtroom or that she be allowed to testify from a remote location, but the judge said either course might prejudice the jury.

She goes from store to store, divesting in one day the purchases and pangs of guilt accumulated over months. What is great about buying, she says, is also great about returning: you experience the emotional rush of handing over your charge card and you end up with a nice shopping bag. Unshopping provides something else. Unshopping rewards you with a credit so that you can shop some more. \n\n     I know people who have returned evening purses after the party, wallets worn  from wear and maternity clothes after the baby was born. Mia Farrow even returned a child. Some people who return cannot face the ambivalence of owning.  Some love business transactions: they watch for sales so that they can take back and rebuy the item. Other returners simply cannot make up their minds. They buy  an article of clothing in several colors and sizes, hoping to make a decision at home with the help of family and friends.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"BACKTALK;Soft Spots Hidden Behind a Granite Jaw","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/backtalksoft-spots-hidden-behind-a-granite-jaw.html","abstract":"Don Shula jumped from his desk, tossed open the door of his office and threw  me out. \n\n     I had never admired or respected him more.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/westchester-guide-049883.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/c-corrections-049646.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"IN BRIEF;NEW JERSEY VOICES","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/in-brief-new-jersey-voices.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Under Apple Big Top, School Is a Headliner","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/under-apple-big-top-school-is-a-headliner.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"ATLANTIC CITY;At the Casinos","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/atlantic-city-at-the-casinos-049840.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"What's On: Tuning In to Public Access Shows","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/what-s-on-tuning-in-to-public-access-shows.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Books in Brief: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-050296.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Travel Advisory;Black History Events Planned for Washington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/travel/travel-advisory-black-history-events-planned-for-washington.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"U.S. Visa to Taiwan Aide","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/world/us-visa-to-taiwan-aide.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"World"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"How to Find a Therapist Without the Misadventures","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/l-how-to-find-a-therapist-without-the-misadventures-052221.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS: January 7, 1996","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/paperback-best-sellers-january-7-1996.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"TEACHING TEACHERS;Getting Minority Students Turned On to Teaching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/education/teaching-teachersgetting-minority-students-turned-on-to-teaching.html","abstract":"Jessica Benitez Elliott almost didn't become a teacher.

Boycott That Changed Dr. King's Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/magazine/the-boycott-that-changed-dr-kings-life.html","abstract":"By the time the Montgomery Improvement Association chose the 26-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. as its leader, the hours-old bus boycott by the black citizens of Montgomery, Ala., was already an overwhelming success. King would later write that his unanticipated call to leadership \"happened so quickly that I did not have time to think it through. It is probable that if I had, I would have declined the nomination.\" \n\n     Although press reports at the time focused on his inspiring oratory, King was actually a reluctant leader of a movement initiated by others. (The boycott began on Dec. 5, 1955.) His subsequent writings and private correspondence reveal a man whose inner doubts sharply contrast with his public persona. In the early days of his involvement, King was troubled by telephone threats, discord within the black community and Montgomery's \"get tough\" policy, to which King attributed his jailing on a minor traffic violation. One night, as he considered ways to \"move out of the picture without appearing a coward,\" he began to pray aloud and, at that moment, \"experienced the presence of the Divine as I had never experienced Him before.\"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"HERS;Doing The Right Thing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/magazine/hersdoing-the-right-thing.html","abstract":"THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN REGISTERED Democrats in the small Massachusetts town where I grew up. The night Jack Kennedy was elected President, all seven of them got drunk and did the twist at the railroad station, so I naturally thought that, aside from having better notions about the role of government, Democrats had more fun than Republicans. That insight alone turned me into a Democrat, and in my numerous recountings of the episode, I can't imagine why it didn't work for my daughter, Caitlin. \n\n     Not long after her 18th birthday, Caitlin told me she had registered to vote. But when she told me she was a Republican, I felt faint.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Ms. Goldstein, Mr. Kramer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/style/ms-goldstein-mr-kramer.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Style"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"INVESTING IT;Zooming Biotechs May Have Staying Power","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/investing-it-zooming-biotechs-may-have-staying-power.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Music to Museum Visitors' Ears: Line Forms Here","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/us/music-to-museum-visitors-ears-line-forms-here.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19960107","headline":"MARKET WATCH;Divine Right Of REIT Kings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/market-watch-divine-right-of-reit-kings.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Dec.31 - Jan. 6;. . . as Yeltsin Ushers Out His Foreign Minister","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/weekinreview/dec.31-jan-6-as-yeltsin-ushers-out-his-foreign-minister.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Week in Review"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"N.J.

LEON WHITESON'S book belongs to a genus that is coming back into fashion after a dormant spell: the miniature memoir, almost an extended essay, partial but intense, more rumination than narrative. It is not unusual for a book of this type to have a presiding metaphor or resonating motif. The writer tours himself, and takes the reader with him, while ostensibly looking out from that self onto its preoccupations. \"In Patagonia,\" by Bruce Chatwin, is a model of the type, fabulously self-absorbed but exhilaratingly inclusive.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"The Original Mogul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/the-original-mogul.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"LET THEM EAT CAKE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/magazine/l-let-them-eat-cake-048887.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Magazine"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"To Unlock Economic Power, Cut the Capital Gains Tax","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/l-to-unlock-economic-power-cut-the-capital-gains-tax-050806.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"The Good Servant","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/the-good-servant.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Child Abuse System Faulted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/child-abuse-system-faulted.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE;In Stuyvesant Town, Customers Can't Bank On Tellers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-side-in-stuyvesant-town-customers-can-t-bank-on-tellers.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Fighting Over Djuna","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/books/l-fighting-over-djuna-049778.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Books"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"An Icebreaker Through The Antarctic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/travel/an-icebreaker-through-the-antarctic.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Children Brighten Adults' Day Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/children-brighten-adults-day-care.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"Sports of The Times;Steeler Stewart Runs With Spirit of Thorpe","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/sports-of-the-times-steeler-stewart-runs-with-spirit-of-thorpe.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"PRO FOOTBALL;Kansas City and Indianapolis Bring Similar Game Plans to Their Playoff Matchup","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/pro-football-kansas-city-indianapolis-bring-similar-game-plans-their-playoff.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL;St. John's Bad Season Is Only Getting Worse","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/college-basketball-st-john-s-bad-season-is-only-getting-worse.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"LONG ISLAND JOURNAL","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/nyregion/long-island-journal-049670.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"New York"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"VOICES: VIEWPOINT;Look, Uncle Sam, No Form 1040's","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/voices-viewpointlook-uncle-sam-no-form-1040s.html","abstract":"THE worst part about the American income tax system is filling out long and complex tax forms -- the sort millions of Americans began receiving from the Internal Revenue Service last week. The I.R.S. already has most of the information we have to enter on numerous forms and schedules. If the United States followed the lead of Britain and many other European countries, most of us could avoid this annual burden. At the same time, the Government would pick up more revenue at less expense. \n\n     How? Through a return-free tax system based on withholding at the source with lower rates. With a few systemic adjustments, the United States could have a less burdensome income tax system that would be simpler and fairer to most taxpayers.","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Business"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL;UConn Ends Tennessee's Reign at Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/sports/college-basketball-uconn-ends-tennessee-s-reign-at-home.html","abstract":"","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"thumbnail_height":0},"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19960107","headline":"RECORDINGS VIEW;Dvorak Does Disney?
