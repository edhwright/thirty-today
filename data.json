The ambitious new piece shared the program with an onstage presentation of costumes worn at the Heian court in Japan from 794 to 1185. An exquisite cultural event in itself, the presentation included the methodical dressing of a model, Kaori Sato, in layer upon layer of silk kimonos of increasingly intense pink to red hues, with witty narration by Celeste Holm.   So when the curtain rose on \"The Tale of Genji,\" drawn from the 11th-century novel by Lady Murasaki, it was something of a shock to see a decidedly nontraditional mixed-race cast, in costumes that seemed to have very little to do with what had gone before, performing theater and movement that mixed Western contemporary and Asian traditional styles. The Japanese-born choreographer, now celebrating her 25th year in America, does know her stuff. The blend was seamless and comfortable, as was the score. But by the end of the ambitious piece, one had very little sense of connection to the characters or this complicated story of a young prince and the women who haunt him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950304","headline":"The Shrinking Welfare State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/opinion/the-shrinking-welfare-state.html","abstract":"  Gov.

He and New York City's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, also want to reduce Home Relief and other welfare benefits outright. Their goal of ending welfare as a way of life is laudable. But punitive acts against people who need help to survive won't take them there.   Driving people off the rolls and cutting welfare benefits rest on a popular but false assumption that New York is a welfare free-spender. The Mayor and Governor point out that the total spent in New York State on the main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (A.F.D.C.), is greater than what is spent by every other state except California. But that is simply because New York has more poor people eligible for welfare than any other state except California.

The difference is that only one other original member of the Scottish band remains, the guitarist Charlie Burchill. Mr. Burchill's increased contribution to the group, and the fact that alternative-rock and grunge have made synthesizer-driven rock seem retro, have resulted in Simple Minds using the guitar instead of the keyboards to power their songs of love and redemption.

In general, it seems to be a means for an investor to place bets on how other, more conventional investments (currencies, commodities, interest rates, whatever) will do, relative to each other, in a given period of time. Or something of the sort. You have to be a computer to figure out whether your bet is winning or losing, but that hasn't stopped investors from succumbing to derivativitis.   Mr. Kroft is more successful at reporting on how companies and other institutions that took fliers on derivatives in recent years wound up in the red, while the brokers who peddled them drew in hefty profits. He begins with the disaster of Orange County, Calif., which suffered a $1.6 billion loss, and he visits less famous financial basket cases in Ohio, where the people in charge all say they were misled.

(AP) YACHT RACING  Women's Team Wins  Getting a new America's Cup yacht up to speed off San Diego proved to be a formidable task during the America  team's first trials race in Round 4 on Thursday, and the result was a loss to Stars & Stripes. But the mechanical troubles, which skipper Leslie Egnot had termed \"teething problems,\" appeared to subside yesterday as the all-women's crew defeated Young America by 56 seconds. J. J. Isler, starting helmswoman on America  's new boat, Mighty Mary, shrewdly steered the yacht off to the right side of the course when a favorable wind shifted in that direction at the start, and 10 minutes later, Mighty Mary tacked in front of Young America, and was ahead by about six boat lengths.

Mr. Grant was leading his first important New York engagement, and he came prepared, producing a set that swung mightily from the first note, and offered up small-group improvisation at its most intense.   Mr. Grant's compositions work around bass figures and drum patterns, along with tempo changes, and an improviser's reaction to it all. At the club, he set a riff for the drummer Carl Allern to solo against, and during improvisations repeated ideas popped up, adding structure to the pieces. As a pianist, Mr. Grant likes busy solos that jump around; he'll slam his left hand as counterpoint to a run, or cram notes together for heavy chordal passages. He likes blues ideas, and on an unaccompanied version of \"Blue in Green,\" bold blues figures added motifs to the improvisation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950304","headline":"Specialized Indexes Help Track Returns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/your-money/IHT-specialized-indexes-help-track-returns.html","abstract":"FOLLOWING investments in emerging markets is notoriously difficult.

For the addicts, artists and other types that the Village Voice columnist Guy Trebay has met roaming the boroughs, that credo is more than a coping mechanism, it's a way of life. Yet in the face of the familiar urban plagues -- crack, heroin and AIDS -- Mr. Trebay's subjects remain fiercely optimistic, like the woman on East Third Street who planted a formal garden next door to a haven for drug addicts, or the artist who hung the trees in a vacant 125th Street lot with empty Ripple wine bottles. These and other bypassed New Yorkers find sympathetic commentary in Mr. Trebay's collection of Voice columns, IN THE PLACE TO BE: Guy Trebay's New York (Temple University, cloth, $49.95; paper, $19.95). Portrayed in Sylvia Plachy's haunting photographs, Mr. Trebay's subjects hold forth in the city's distinct vernacular. The author does not use his role as chronicler to moralize. There are no politics or preaching in his candid takes on a venereal disease clinic, a crack hot line or a homeless woman who lives in the 145th Street subway station. This is a frank and engaging look at a city that teaches its inhabitants not to make eye contact. \nHANNA RUBIN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Philistinism All Over Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/arts/l-victim-art-philistinism-all-over-again-456295.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In the storm of mostly self-serving responses to Arlene Croce's \"non-review\" of Bill T.

And the building's design, by Robert A. M.

Not that the new building isn't steeped in history. Disney's sprawling global empire of fantasy and real estate was built on animation, and the modest buildings in which Snow White and Bambi were born still stand on the company's lot in Burbank, Calif.. But in the years after Disney's death in 1966, the company's commitment to animation had faltered. By the time Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, revived that commitment, with the success of \"Beauty and the Beast\" in 1991, working quarters for the company's shrunken animation department had been split into eight different off-lot locations. The new building, which brings together most of the department's 1,400 animators beneath one roof, thus signifies a reunion as well as a revival.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"'I Gave So Much to Others?'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/books/i-gave-so-much-to-others.html","abstract":"  ANAIS NIN A Biography.

They are wrong. The American people are not nearly as isolationist as the moronic politicians who speak in their name.   The Chicago Council on Foreign Relations has been tracking American attitudes on foreign policy since 1974. Its latest poll, conducted by Gallup and released today, shows the following: 65 percent of those surveyed said the U.S. should \"take an active part\" in world affairs rather than \"stay out.\" That is up from the 1980's.

Many of the trails are really ancient shortcuts, once used by shepherds, farmers and peddlers as a steep but faster way to get from one village or one valley to another. James Fenimore Cooper, during a sojourn in Switzerland in the 1820's, hiked part of the route, and by the middle of that century the tour was popular with British visitors.

At the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, an abstract painter in the guise of a realist who chronicles timeless aspects of life, meets Jean-Michel Basquiat, who was a rafter on the stream of consciousness.\n\nMangold's retrospective consists of 58 paintings made between 1976 and 1994 that evince an especially severe, if essentially American subject matter. The earliest works are paintings of bare wooden floors, sometimes depicted reflected in mirrors, that our Puritan ancestors would have countenanced. She emphasizes a geometrical blockiness, a planked floor is essentially a grid, but also has the freedom to indulge in the amorphousness of wood grain.

It should also be remembered that different approaches suit different media. Thus, the witty Salinger allusion may be undeniably pithy in a review of John Irving's new novel, but in a sample script for \"Empty Nest\" a reference to Nell Carter's cellulite is certainly more appropriate.   And, with all due respect, such cellulite commentary might also lead to an annual income far surpassing that of most book critics. A funny sample script (referred to as a \"spec\" script) is Hollywood's calling card, and it can lead to employment as a disgustingly overpaid television scribe.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"A New Restaurant Will Prepare American and Asian-Marinated Steaks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/nyregion/a-la-carte-a-new-restaurant-will-prepare-american-and-asian-marinated-steaks.html","abstract":"  EAST will meet West in Huntington Village when Miller's Steak House opens in May.

Well, language may have been a problem at first. In 1915, when Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray met on Duchamp's first trip here from France, they could barely communicate in the usual way, which was seldom their primary interest anyway. At their first meeting, they played tennis without a net, carefully keeping score. Robert Frost would compare free verse to playing tennis without a net, meaning that rules were necessary to give resonance to art; Duchamp and Man Ray made careers out of breaking rules in pursuit of new resonance and new ways of playing the game.    By the time they met, Duchamp (1887-1968) had already contributed to the founding of Dada in Europe. His \"Nude Descending a Staircase\" had caused a scandal at the 1913 Armory Show in New York; one newspaper called it an \"explosion in a shingle factory,\" and even Teddy Roosevelt berated it. Man Ray (1890-1976) did not have his first one-man show until a month or so after their meeting, but he was already operating on a Dada wavelength.

That may be one reason the music took so many forms (jazz, blues, gospel), and why the offshoot of each form had its own name (rhythm-and-blues, doo-wop, soul), and its own musical, and social, twist. But none of these forms had lived an entirely segregated life: to one degree or another they had all taken what they wanted or needed from white music. With its youthful postwar brashness, aimed at teen-agers, rock-and-roll sped up this process.   The black pioneers of rock-and-roll were not giving America unfettered race testimony or self-expression. They were giving America calculated entertainment in bright racial Technicolor. Rock-and-roll was show business. To secure a mass audience it had to appeal to young blacks across class lines: be funky but suave too; primal, then languid, then ironic. And it had to lure young whites across both class lines and the great racial divide: it had to be exotic enough to thrill them but familiar enough to make them feel at home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"Once There Was Shag and a Family Called Brady","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/movies/taking-the-children-once-there-was-shag-and-a-family-called-brady-465195.html","abstract":"  The Brady Bunch Movie  Shelley Long, Gary Cole and special appearances by RuPaul, the Monkees and original cast members Directed by Betty Thomas PG-13 95 minutes","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950305","headline":"BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mercedes-Benz C36; Sumptuous Sedan For Serious Fun","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/automobiles/behind-the-wheel-mercedes-benz-c36-sumptuous-sedan-for-serious-fun.html","abstract":"  HAVING grown up in a German family, I think I can safely say that giddy humor is not the touchstone of my ethnicity.

Both Reich and the areas of investigation to which he devoted himself were controversial, but this is not a basis on which to judge the results of his labors.
