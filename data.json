Soon they will be again, though, now that the terminal's landlord, the Penn Central Corporation of Cincinnati, has given the Metropolitan Transportation Authority a new 110-year lease.   The lease, along with Penn Central's agreement to relinquish its right to build a skyscraper over the terminal, means the M.T.A. will now go full steam ahead on its plans for a $100 million renovation. The ceiling is part of that renovation; so are the construction of a monumental staircase to the east balcony and the restoration of historic storefronts and entrances.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"If You Could Make It There . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/if-you-could-make-it-there.html","abstract":"FLORENCE\nThe Biography of a City.\nBy Christopher Hibbert.\nIllustrated. 398 pp. New York:\nW.

My husband and I are considering going to Lourdes from Paris next April and would like to know about train and plane service between the two cities. -- Rita M. Solomon, Masontown, Pa.   A. To get to Lourdes, you can fly from Orly to either the Tarbes or Pau Airport. A single Air Inter flight operates daily, departing at 10:55 A.M. and arriving at Tarbes Airport, six miles from Lourdes, at 12:10 P.M. (1:40 P.M. on Sunday). Up to four flights a day serve Pau, which is 25 miles west of Lourdes. Bus service links both airports to Lourdes. For flight information, call (800) 237-2747.   Most passengers can take advantage of the Visite Fare of about $176 round trip (coded YAP) if they buy a ticket to Tarbes or Pau when getting an international ticket. Another favorable fare is the Super Loisir, which is about $141 round trip; it requires a Saturday night stay.    The T.G.V., or high-speed train, which takes 5 hours and 20 minutes, departs from Gare Montparnasse in Paris at 8:10 A.M., 2 P.M. and 5:40 P.M.

Its urgent postwar mixture of banks and advertising agencies, trade fairs and skyscrapers, doesn't have much of a precedent in German history, and the city, on weekdays, at least, can move at a bustling, un-Germanlike pace.  Frankfurt, in fact, has the highest percentage of resident foreigners of any German city, and it was probably this international flavor (and accompanying vagueness) that allowed it to reinvent itself in the 1980's with such dramatic flair. Not merely content -- actually, not at all content -- with being the country's financial center, Frankfurt embarked on a spree of museum construction that has placed it in contention with Munich, Berlin and Cologne for the title of Kunststadt, or city of art. \n\nThe most significant project, called the Museumsufer, or Museum Embankment, promoted the establishment of new museums, as well as the refurbishment or rehousing of nearby existing museums, on the Schaumainkai, the tree-lined avenue along the left bank of the Main River. The Museum Embankment, which was planned in the late 1970's and has just entered its finishing stages in the last couple of years, was meant to create an alternative kind of urbanity to the financial district and the neighborhood behind the train station, a red-light district that most Germans dismiss as a smaller, less compelling version of Hamburg's Reeperbahn. Consquently, many of the museums maintain beautiful parks, cafes and libraries.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Death Comes to the Professor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/death-comes-to-the-professor.html","abstract":"  LITERARY MURDER A Critical Case.

As a freshman at Smith College in Massachusetts, very far from my home in Ames, Iowa, I read about Travel Time in the students' handbook. Christmas vacation at Smith always began at a sternly precise minute -- 12:50 P.M., as I remember -- and failure to register in that last morning class, on what was called an Official Calendar Day, brought dire punishment.   But those few students who lived beyond the Mississippi were eligible for travel time. If they could satisfactorily prove to the registrar that their journey took more than 36 hours, they were allowed to leave up to 48 hours early. All that first fall I had been desperately homesick, marking off each alien day until I could return to my loved and familiar Midwest. Two days early? Incredulous, but hopeful, I read that paragraph in the handbook again. Quickly I figured my train connections. First the Boston & Maine commuter from Northampton to Springfield, then the long-haul New York Central to Chicago and finally the stop-and-go, rackety ride on the Chicago & Northwestern right into the Ames station. At first my total was several hours short, but I judiciously adjusted here and there until I came up with an only slightly padded figure of 37. Suddenly it was as if someone had erased two days from an immutable sentence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Sports of The Times; Postcards From an Odd Year: Here to There and Then Back Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-postcards-from-an-odd-year-here-to-there-and-then-back-again.html","abstract":"  ODD-NUMBERED years are odd.

The basis of support for policing our society must come from all citizens. Given this basic tenet, it follows that police agencies should be representative of the populations they serve. To be otherwise diminishes their ability to respond empathetically to many community concerns and reinforces the perception held by some segments of the minority public that law-enforcement agencies represent the force of the dominant society, to preserve the status quo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Crime","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/crime-906893.html","abstract":"  \"You don't want to know me,\" warns Eddie Dain, the tormented antihero of Joe Gores's nerve-plucking crime novel DEAD MAN (Mysterious Press/Warner, $18.95). \"I'm bad news.

Thanks to documents released on United States activities in El Salvador we know that the Ambassador reported to Washington that United States military advisers had for some time been training the Salvadoran civilian financiers of the death squads -- in his words, \"gun-toting Soldier of Fortune-magazine-subscribing, rich young extremists\" -- at United States expense. As you report (front page, Dec. 14), Mr. Walker stopped the training, over our military's objections.   After the sordid disclosures of a dozen years of United States policy in El Salvador, his indignant tone rings slightly off-key. Indeed, embarrassed Pentagon officials wondered aloud if Mr. Walker had not read their memos informing him that United States advisers were providing weapons and training to those they agreed were \"pretty much\" as the Ambassador described them.    Who, let alone the United States Ambassador, could be surprised that our tax dollars supported private war games with Salvadorans known to bankroll death squad activities? Or amazed that, as you report, the United States military defended its wealthy students because they merely paid others to kill, and resisted Mr. Walker's attempt to halt the training, so as not to insult the military sponsor of the trainees, himself among the worst human rights offenders?    Outrageous? Certainly. Astonishing? Not really.   The Reagan Administration conceived of, financed and trained the Salvadoran army's \"elite\" Atlacatl Battalion, which made El Mozote a household name in human rights circles by massacring an entire town of 700 civilians in 1981. The Bush Administration was still training the Atlacatl on Nov. 13, 1989, three days before its commandos marched into the Jesuit university residence to murder six priests and two women.    In the Jesuit case, and other instances when embarrassed by Salvadoran clients, United States officials, including Mr. Walker, offered denials, followed by limited admissions in the face of mounting proof and, ultimately, questionable accounts of what they knew and when they knew it.   Successive administrations provide the American public with new examples of official credulity tinged with cynicism. Most recently, Clinton Administration officials intoned their respect for the professionalism of Haiti's military leaders, despite rampant officially sponsored terror, only to express shock and outrage when military henchmen scared off United States ships carrying military trainers and then shot the Justice Minister, Guy Malary, to death on the streets of Port-au-Prince.    As a Nov. 14 front-page article disclosed, United States officials have reasons to know better. Senior members of a military intelligence and counternarcotics unit, formed and paid by the Central Intelligence Agency, ran drugs, engaged in political terror and threatened to kill the local Drug Enforcement Agency chief.   For many Haitians, including the martyred Justice Minister and likely the exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the damage is irreversible.    New death squad killings in El Salvador offer the United States an opportunity to restore some squandered credibility on human rights by pushing for investigations and prosecutions, regardless of where the evidence leads. In Haiti, United States diplomats must insure that the military's aggression is not rewarded, as some fear, with a blanket amnesty, an infusion of foreign funds and a pliant civilian government in exchange for a face-saving exit for United States policy.   As Haiti and El Salvador slide into news media eclipse, only public attention will police our leaders. In a sense, those United States trainers of death squad patrons have done their country a service. They have reminded all of us beyond any lingering doubt that our Government cannot be trusted to police itself.  ROBERT O.

The new, united Germany is finding that the post-cold-war world is a more harshly competitive place than it was before.

But as they have become parents themselves, many have been forced to grapple anew with the place of religion in their lives.   Theirs is often a wrenching search. They are torn between guilt, reluctance and nostalgia, between the sense that religion would be good for their children and their own lack of belief in some spiritual doctrines, as well as their discomfort with the way many religious institutions are run. A Sense of Duty    In a society that seems more frightening and amoral than ever, many parents say they yearn for a moral safety net, a place that will reinforce the values they hope to teach at home. Others feel they should at least expose children to religion, as a possible source of comfort and faith. Still others conclude that religion is not the answer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Why I'm the Poet I've Become: Berryman and the Lucky 13","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/why-im-the-poet-ive-become-berryman-and-the-lucky-13.html","abstract":"I CAN'T say if all poets have had mentors, actual living, breathing masters who stood or sat before them making the demands that true mentors must make if the fledgling is ever to fly. Some poets seem to have been totally self-starting, like the cars they used to build in Detroit; I'm thinking of such extraordinary examples as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, who over a hundred years ago created not only their own gigantic works but the beginnings of something worthy enough to be American poetry, and they did it out of their imaginations and their private studies and nothing more. But then they had the advantage of being geniuses. And neither was from Detroit.\n\nI think also of those poets who had to be poets, whom no one or nothing short of death could have derailed from their courses -- John Keats, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Rimbaud -- and who outstripped their mentors before they even got into second gear. There are those who were lucky enough to find among their peers people of equal talent and insight to help them on their way -- poets like William Carlos Williams and Ezra Pound, who for the crucial early years of their writing careers ignited each other.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Living Where Edison Filmed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/nyregion/neighborhood-report-bedford-park-living-where-edison-filmed.html","abstract":"  Construction of a much-awaited apartment building for the low-income elderly was completed earlier this month at the very spot where Thomas A.

He discovered his toy in the early 1960's, around the time Leo Castelli gave him his first one-man show, and after that he was scarcely to be caught painting without it. Indeed, even though Diane Waldman, the author of ROY LICHTENSTEIN (Guggenheim Museum/Rizzoli, $59.95) -- the hefty, bright catalogue for the artist's retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum through Jan. 16 -- quotes him as saying, \"I want my painting to look as if it has been programmed. I want to hide the record of my hand,\" he obviously has had no such luck. The Benday dots are the record of his own hand, and it is one of the most recognizable hands around. Conveniently for Ms. Waldman, the Guggenheim's deputy director, who is sometimes a bit too ponderous about her subject, Mr. Lichtenstein's untroubled and uncomplicated life's work fits neatly into thematic chapters: his caricatures of comic strips, of advertisements, landscapes, brush strokes, mirrors, entablatures, still lifes, various Expressionist, Surrealist and Futurist paintings, and interiors of suburban houses. We see the artist latching onto a theme, playing it out and then easing into the next theme, often looking casually backward to incorporate elements of his past paintings into the new ones. The amazing thing is that regardless of Mr. Lichtenstein's subject he has been able to hold the same ironic pose for 30 years without flinching. His consistent style serves somewhat the same role as a person with an unchangeably wry expression. Just as the wry look seems to take on different meanings depending on what it confronts, so Mr. Lichtenstein's Benday dots and flat primary colors read like a running commentary, pointing out the proper objects for parody at each moment and suggesting that at some point virtually everything is fair game.

But that means digging its own pits, mostly at the edges of the street and on the sidewalks, which makes many store owners angry about blocked access.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"What Would Happen If . . . ?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/books/what-would-happen-if.html","abstract":"  RUSSIA 2010 And What It Means for the World.

In the visitor's locker room at Madison Square Garden, a man who goes by the name Bam Bam sat on a trainer's table with his mouth open and his face in a grimace of pain. He had been hit in the face by an intentionally errant hockey stick that happened to belong to a player from New York. One tooth was broken off at the gum line, the nerve exposed. Another was bent at such an angle that Bam Bam -- better known as Scott Stevens, now with the New Jersey Devils -- could not close his mouth.   This was not a major crisis for Bam Bam, who had played the remainder of the previous period with his jaw hanging open and the taste of blood in his mouth. He wasn't worried about it, he just wanted back on the ice. Dr. Don Salomon wasn't quite so calm. Dr. Salomon is the younger of the Rangers' two team dentists (his mentor and partner, Dr. Irwin Miller, otherwise known by the players as \"Miller the Driller,\" has been with the National Hockey League team since the 1978-79 season), and it was his job to fix Mr. Stevens's teeth so that he could finish the game.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Miss Seldes, Mr. Carnahan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/style/engagements-miss-seldes-mr-carnahan.html","abstract":"  Aileen Patterson Seldes of New York and Timothy Seldes of Washington have announced the engagement of their daughter, Elisabeth Hall Seldes, to Matthew McNair Carnahan, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth M.

Mr. McGrath states that \"9 out of 10 times they can't recall a thing.\" He does not think that there is much sexual abuse and he concludes that \"there does certainly appear to be a lot of people in the mental health field fueling their careers on it.\"   What the literature on the subject shows is quite different from Mr. McGrath's views. The American Humane Society's clearinghouse on child abuse show that 60,000 to 100,000 children are sexually abused annually in the United States; this is equivalent to saying that 10 to 14 percent of American families are affected by child sexual abuse each year. According to the researchers, Kee MacFarlane and Dr. Jill Waterman, in a study done in 1986, current reliable estimates range from 100,000 to 500,000 cases per year and another study, done in 1980 suggests that one-fourth to one-third of all children have at least one sexual experience with an adult. Further, studies show that the vast majority of victims of incestuous abuse are females and approximately 98 percent of the perpetrators are males. Usually the male perpetrator is someone familiar to the victim.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"Works That Are Immune From Any Trends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/nyregion/art-works-that-are-immune-from-any-trends.html","abstract":"  THOUGH large enough to hold a sizable party, Aljira, the Center for Contemporary Art at 2 Washington Place here, can hardly contain the associations aroused by its two current shows.

The Manhattan Beach Community Group had complained that a 6-foot cyclone fence built by Jack Laboz of 293 Amherst Street interrupted the seven-block walkway connecting Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach. But on Dec. 15, Justice Leonard E. Yoswein dismissed contentions that the esplanade is a public easement. The group, made up of 800 residents, plans to appeal.   * FORT GREENE    The future of the South Oxford Tennis Club, the city's only black-owned tennis club, remains uncertain after construction began this month on Atlantic Center, a major revitalization effort in Fort Greene.   The city, which owns the club's land, told its owner, Richard Northern, in August that the club would have to close in November to make room for moderate- to middle-income housing in the Atlantic Center, a commercial and residential complex. But Mr. Northern, the founder of the club at 187 South Oxford Street, has refused to close the building and has pressured city officials to include it in the redevelopment plan.   The developer, the Forest City Ratner Companies, now says it is unsure whether the club, in a three-story neo-Georgian structure on the fringe of the Fort Greene Historic District, will have to close.   On Dec. 14, construction began on a Bradlees department store near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues and Hanson Place. The store is to occupy about 120,000 square feet on two stories and serve as Atlantic Center's anchor tenant in 210,000 square feet of commercial space.   * PROSPECT PARK    A police task force patrolling the cultural institutions around Prospect Park has been increased to 21 officers from 14 to create a feeling of safety for visitors.   The task force patrols Prospect Park, the Prospect Park Wildlife Center, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Brooklyn Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum, which attract a total of more than two million visitors a year.   The creation of the task force in 1991-92 and the recent increase in staff was recommended by Borough President Howard Golden's Crown Heights Coalition, which was worried that visitors would be frightened away after the 1991 racial disturbances. No increase in crime has been reported, the police say.   The added security is unrelated to the increased police presence ordered in Prospect Park after the murder of a drama teacher, Allyn Winslow, last spring, the police said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931226","headline":"A Knotty 'Orfeo' Untangled With Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/arts/recordings-view-a-knotty-orfeo-untangled-with-style.html","abstract":"  FEW OPERAS PRESENT quite such a tangled mass of problems as the earliest one that is still performed with any frequency. \"L'Orfeo,\" Monteverdi's retelling of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, has come down to us in parts that are notorious for their vagueness.

Even the hot young chefs are at their most thrilling when they \"interpret\" (as they call it) the traditional dishes of the surrounding Lazio region. Foreign restaurants, though no longer countable only on the fingers, are still largely ignored by both the public and, it is my impression, other restaurateurs. One way to satisfy the yen for something a little different is to go to a restaurant serving the cuisine of another region of Italy. Dal Bolognese    Bologna is to Italian food more or less what Stratford-upon-Avon is to English literature. The Emilia-Romagna region, of which Bologna is the capital, is the home of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and prosciutto di Parma, spinach pasta, tortellini, fabulous sausages and meat sauces that are made of meat, not tomato.    The challenge for a restaurant is basically just not to make any mistakes or to let the classic turn stale.   It was the lasagne verdi at Dal Bolognese that made me fall in love with Italian food some 20 years ago. (At least it was what led me to buy the first book by Marcella Hazan, a native of Emilia-Romagna, after which there was no going back.) When I returned last month, lasagne verdi was still on the menu and still inspiring.    The pasta was lightly flecked with spinach, the bechamel unobtrusive, and together they provided a squishy cushion for the tender little chunks of meat (not ground meat) suspended in a sauce that showed no visible tomato.    The Parmesan cheese was grated, as it should be, directly onto the plate. But my companion's tagliatelle al ragu -- plain egg noodles with the same meat sauce and plenty of Parmesan -- was, in its bold simplicity, even better than the lasagne.   The decor of Dal Bolognese is classic and clubby, and the address, on historic, high-rent Piazza del Popolo, tells you right off to expect customers as rich as the food.    On a recent Sunday at lunch -- the most hectic meal of the week in Italy -- the place was full of show people and cashmere-and-pearls perfect families, clearly regulars.   In such circumstances, in Rome, faces not known from either the neighborhood or the screen are often ignored. But the service was professional beyond the call of duty.    No sooner had my snobbish Italian companion raised one eyebrow to make a crack about how Americans would enjoy the sparkling Lambrusco, than our waiter was at his elbow offering to change the wine if he didn't like it.   We kept the Lambrusco, a light, regional red, to accompany his gran bollito misto, the restaurant's -- and the region's -- piece de resistance, and what practically everybody there was eating. This assortment of boiled meats is served from a special cart (carrello) that keeps them warm in their various broths.    The meats are presented with, as condiments, tubs of green sauce and \"mostarda,\" a fascinating fruit preserve typical, in many variations, of the northern regions of Italy.   The meats include (in the proportions the diner requests) beef, tongue, fowl, cotechino sausage, and, by rights, veal head, but when my companion asked for the latter, all that was left was a bit of ear.   My polpettone alla bolognese, two slices of a light meatloaf baked around a hard-boiled egg and served with mashed potatoes (pure in Italian) was less of a production but quite nice. The menu includes some cold dishes and simple grilled meats, so that you can get away with eating less than 3,000 calories, but there's no point in ordering anything other than regional specialties.   For antipasto, the best choice is a plate of unadorned culatello di Zibello, a delicate prosciutto-like specialty of Parma considered the aristocrat of Italian cold cuts and uncommon in Rome.   The homemade desserts, after an encounter with the carrello, seemed less appealing than something smooth and slippery, like creme caramel or sorbetto. Il Drappo   Admittedly the idea of a chi-chi Sardinian restaurant gives pause.    The region is one of Italy's poorest and most rugged, and away from the coast, its cuisine is that of the shepherds of the mountainous hinterland, which runs to grilled sheep innards -- definitely not on the menu at Il Drappo.    But the owner-chefs, Paolo and Valentina Tonu, are Sardinian brother and sister and the menu is built around island ingredients and themes, with delicious results.    And the particularly interesting breadbasket contains the typically Sardinian flat, brittle bread known as carta da musica (music paper).   The system at Il Drappo is the fixed-price meal, beginning with an antipasto of diced tomatoes on crunchy thin bread (you have to use both fork and fingers) plus tiny pizzas and some other tidbit, which on our recent visit was fritters with salady stuff inside.    The wine is the house Sardinian red or white.   The first courses change frequently but always offer at least one soup (lentil at our recent dinner) and an ample choice of pastas, usually with seafood or vegetarian sauces. We tried fettuccine with cozze (mussels) and vongole (clams) in a light, but very piquant, tomato sauce; spaghetti with chicory and bottarga (dried mullet roe), and spaghetti in a sauce of nero di seppia (cuttlefish ink).    All were wonderful, but the spaghetti with bottarga -- a specialty of Sardinia -- was sublime.   The main course offerings always include both meat and fish, usually in labor-intensive preparations, a welcome change in Rome. Our roast baby pork (maialino), however, was quite simple and classically Sardinian; the peppers stuffed with artichokes were less orthodox and more typically Drappo.   On another occasion, we enjoyed the grilled, stuffed squid, though the meatballs were a bit boring (both were offered on our most recent visit).   Dessert is seadas, dough filled with white cheese, then fried and topped with bitter honey. It's typically Sardinian, and very good. A chilled glass of Sardinian grappa or the much tamer bilberry liqueur called \"mirto\" finishes the meal.   Some people find the decor -- billowing draperies on the ceiling, Sardinian cork in the place of wood paneling -- too precious, but the waiter, Mario Bergantilli, manages to convey the true spirit of the place: the only thing you should take seriously is cleaning your plate. Tavola d'Oro   The only full-fledged Sicilian restaurant in Rome (though a handful of others serve Sicilian dishes) is a hole in the wall that becomes unbearably smoky and unmanageable when crowded, which is usually.   But a friend and I were there when it opened at 7:30 one recent evening, and enjoyed reasonable service, including the attention of the proprietor, Elisabetta Esposito.   In any case, one doesn't go there for the ambiance; one goes in spite of it, for the food.   Caponata, that wonderful Sicilian concoction based on eggplant, tomato, onion, and celery, is easier to find in New York than in Rome, so our antipasto Siciliano -- caponata, marinated zucchini, black and green olives, and roasted sweet peppers -- was sheer bliss.   The pasta offerings include the archetypal Sicilian preparation -- called alla Norma, after Bellini's opera -- with a tomato and eggplant sauce over little shells and ricotta salata grated on top; bucatini with sardines (also de rigueur); and short pasta, like penne, with broccoli (actually the pale-green cross between the cauliflower and broccoli appearing in American markets as \"broccoflower\") and caciocavallo cheese.   The most interesting main dishes are involtini (roll-ups) of eggplant stuffed with ground meat and the typical bistecca alla palermitana, a breaded veal cutlet baked, not fried, and large enough to share. The crespelle -- great hulking fritters, one filled with ricotta and the other with anchovies -- were too heavy.   Anyone who is able to continue can finish with a ricotta-filled cannolo -- the Sicilian dessert par excellence. Al Brigante Crocco    About 10 minutes' taxi ride from the center of town is a restaurant representing Italy's most depressed region, Basilicata, or Lucania (an archaic name), which is in the middle of the south, between Puglia on the east and Campania and Calabria on the west.    The region has almost no seacoast, and the dominant flavors of Basilicata are animal, dairy and vegetable.   This restaurant, whimsically named for a 19th-century brigand, is a cozy little spot that makes some effort to evoke its origins in its decor, which includes pottery dishes and hanging antique pistols.   The menu is strongest in the early courses. The antipasto consists of a plate of salamis and a plate of marinated eggplant, olives, mushrooms and the exotic lampascione, which looks like a small onion but has a bitter taste all its own. There was a good mushroom and potato soup on recent visit, but the homemade pastas, orecchiette (\"little ears\") and strascinati (flat disks of pasta about the size of a 50-cent piece), are the whole point of going to a Lucanian restaurant.   We found the orecchiette con cime di rape (broccoletti in Rome, broccoli rape in New York) a bit thin and flat (but then I found it insipid homemade in Basilicata too), especially in comparison with Tavola d'Oro's richer version. But there was nothing insipid about the superb strascinati with a strong tomato sauce, eggplant, and pecorino cheese. The rabbit with olives and the meatballs were uninteresting; neither satisfied the urge for the exotic that had taken us to the restaurant in the first place.    We might have done better with the baked baccala (salt cod), the only fish on the menu.    The carafe wine, an Aglianico (the inevitable red of Basilicata), was terrible. We eventually asked for a bottle (also Aglianico), which was decent, but we were charged for both.   The restaurant seats 45, which was about 35 more than it could handle on a Saturday night.

Life was very quiet here until the 1930's, when giant machines began tearing up the countryside to extract the high-quality coal that lies in thick deposits 30 to 80 yards beneath the surface.   During the Communist era, coal from this region stoked homes and factories throughout eastern Europe.  In Altdobern, a community of 3,800, two-thirds of the workers were connected to the coal industry. But the collapse of the Communist alliance, and the access to more efficient western producers and alternative fuels, has meant slow death for the industry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931227","headline":"Review/Television; Adultery With Contrition As Only Opera Can Do It","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/27/arts/review-television-adultery-with-contrition-as-only-opera-can-do-it.html","abstract":"  Even before its premiere in Trieste in 1850, Verdi's \"Stiffelio\" was having trouble with censors because of its depiction of a man of the cloth, in this case an evangelical Protestant minister, and his adulterous wife.

Otherwise, he will not be able to hit Congress's deficit-reduction targets and pay for his economic strategy of investing in education, training, research and infrastructure.   Yet last week he made the budget hole $10 billion deeper by giving the Pentagon money to pay Congressionally mandated salary increases over the next five years. And the Pentagon wants even more to cover inflation during a five-year period in which it already plans to spend a whopping $1.2 trillion. That averages $240 billion a year -- about five times what Russia spends on defense and nearly as much as the rest of the world combined.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931227","headline":"Analysis of Vote Yields Clues to Giuliani's Future","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/27/nyregion/metro-matters-analysis-of-vote-yields-clues-to-giuliani-s-future.html","abstract":"  WHO lost Chinatown?
