While Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were serving the subpoenas, President Clinton met with the White House counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, who was one of those subpoenaed, to arrange the lawyer's resignation. Mr. Nussbaum told Mr. Clinton that he would step down on Saturday, aides said.   On an extraordinary day in which Mr. Clinton and his aides tried to contain the political damage, they battled a rising tide of bad news, including signs that some Democrats were quietly joining the Republican clamor for Congressional hearings into Mr. Clinton's investment in an Arkansas real estate venture, the Whitewater Development Company. The Clintons were partners in the venture with James B. McDougal, the head of the savings and loan. Information Quest    The subpoenas were issued by Robert B. Fiske, the special counsel appointed to look into the Whitewater matter, but there was no indication that they were for any purpose other than the gathering of information.   All 10 of the officials were named in news accounts this week as having taken part in unusual meetings to discuss the Federal investigation of the Arkansas savings institution, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. Mr. Fiske has broad-based authority under his charter to determine whether the Government has handled itself properly in that case.   Not since the Iran-contra affair has a Federal law enforcement agency reached this deeply into the White House as part of an official inquiry. The subpoenas of top aides to Mr. Clinton and to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen handed the White House a major embarrassment as officials tried to steer attention away from Whitewater.  Sensitive Subject    At those meetings, the Treasury and White House aides reviewed the status of an investigation by the Resolution Trust Corporation into Madison Guaranty, a sensitive subject that would ordinarily be kept from political officials and anyone with a connection to the institution. No one has suggested that there was anything criminal about such discussions, but they might have violated Government ethics regulations.    The six White House aides subpoenaed to testify were Mr. Nussbaum; Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton; Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff; Mark D. Gearan, the communications director; Maggie Williams, the chief of staff to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.   All were ordered to appear in Federal District Court in Washington on March 10 to provide testimony for a grand jury in Little Rock, Ark.    A separate subpoena demanded that the White House surrender all documents and communications relating to contacts between the White House and Treasury Department officials about Madison Guaranty.   In response, Joel I. Klein, the deputy White House counsel, issued four memorandums ordering the White House staff, janitors and technicians not to destroy information and documents in files, computers, waste baskets and burn bags.   Howard Schloss, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said Deputy Secretary Roger C. Altman; Jean Hanson, the department counsel, and Josh Steiner, Mr. Bentsen's chief of staff, had also been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury under the direction of Mr. Fiske.    A participant in the meetings said that Jack DeVore, Mr. Bentsen's closest aide at the time, was also told to appear before the grand jury.   Associates of Mr. Nussbaum said that he had hoped to postpone his resignation long enough to diminish the impression that he had been dismissed but that he had recognized as the day progressed that he had little option but to step down immediately.   As soon as the first meeting was disclosed, Republicans began demanding a new inquiry into the Clintons' investment and put pressure on Mr. Clinton to act firmly to disavow the talks. Today, some Democrats also seemed to be considering hearings on Whitewater. Expectations for a Day    Mr. Clinton had to cope with the question of Mr. Nussbaum's fate on a day in which a meeting with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine was supposed to be the main event. At a picture-taking session and a joint news conference in the East Room, the first question to Mr. Clinton was whether Mr. Nussbaum, who is 57, would remain at his post. Mr. Clinton later added discussions with top aides to his afternoon calendar to consider that very question.    But the White House agenda became even more complicated late this afternoon, when the F.B.I. told William H.  Kennedy 3d, an associate White House counsel, that it planned to serve the six subpoenas. Mr. Kennedy told Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, who told Mr. Clinton about 6 P.M., just before he began to talk with Mr. Nussbaum.   An F.B.I. agent served the six subpoenas about an hour later in the White House counsel's suite. In a written statement tonight, Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary said, \"The White House will comply fully and promptly with the subpoena.\"   Before the latest round of criticism over his role in the Whitewater affair, Mr. Nussbaum had already been at the center of a series of White House political miscues, including the failed nomination of Lani Guinier to a top Justice Department post, the torturous search for an Attorney General and the removal of files from the office of Vincent W. Foster Jr., Mr. Nussbaum's deputy who killed himself in July.   Officials said that history, coupled with Mr. Nussbaum's most recent actions, had left his position difficult to defend, especially after officials said that the once-unquestioned support of his political patron, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was in doubt.  A Telling Symbol    \"If this was the first time in the barrel for him, maybe we could fight for him,\" a senior White House official said. \"But the third time is hard.\"   Earlier today, Mr. Clinton refused twice to comment about Mr. Nussbaum's fate, a telling symbol in the Washington political lexicon. The President was said by aides to be particularly upset that the White House lawyer had not anticipated trouble from the series of meetings with senior Treasury Department officials on the investigation into the bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan.   Associates of Mr. Nussbaum said he would have preferred that a decent interval pass before he resigns his post. But they said Mr. Clinton's failure to express confidence in him during public appearances today could only have been intended as a message that it was time to leave.   Other officials said aides to Mrs. Clinton had told associates in the Administration that she was disappointed in the way Mr. Nussbaum, her one-time mentor, had handled the matter. Because of her close friendship with Mr. Nussbaum, Mrs. Clinton's views on the issue are crucial.   Even this morning, a close friend of Mr. Nussbaum's said, \"None of us see how he can survive much longer.\"   Before this week's first disclosure of his participation in an unusual meeting, Mr. Nussbaum had told friends that he believed his job was to be a kind of a lightning rod for the Administration. But he told the friends that he hoped to stay in the White House for at least another year, if not until the end of Mr. Clinton's first term, and had recently bought a residence at the Watergate Apartments. Consequences of a Resignation    By this afternoon, senior White House officials were discussing what the consequences of a resignation by Mr. Nussbaum might be, and whether it might help close the political wounds inflicted by the disclosure of the meetings.   Mr. Clinton on Thursday expressed dismay that the meetings had taken place, but that only led Republicans in Congress today to voice new complaints about the White House's conduct.   After poking for months at Whitewater's embers, the Republicans expressed new confidence that the missteps would finally force Congress's Democratic majority to undertake hearings. And, more dangerously for the White House, some Democrats began to echo them privately.   In the Senate, where Republicans were already pledging to hold up approval of important White House nominations until a Whitewater hearing was scheduled, aides to senior Democratic senators said there was growing uneasiness among their bosses.   Saying that they were growing resigned to the possibility that some kind of inquiry might be necessary, if only to quiet the mounting furor from Republicans and other critics, the aides said the matter had been referred to Senate Democratic leaders.   In addition to Mr. Nussbaum, only Ms. Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel, took part in all three of the briefing sessions. The two were the only participants in what White House officials have described as the most troublesome encounter, on Sept. 29. In that meeting, Ms. Hanson told Mr. Nussbaum that the Clintons would be mentioned as possible beneficiaries of illegal actions in a request for a Justice Department investigation of Madison Guaranty by the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is responsible for failed S.& L.'s.   That was more than a week before the R.T.C. formally referred the case to the Justice Department and before the decision became final, giving Mr. Nussbaum advance knowledge of information that under other circumstances is regarded as highly sensitive. Meetings in Question    Another meeting took place in October and the third, last month. The others who were served subpoenas attended these meetings except Ms. Caputo. She acknowledged this week that she had received a brief telephone call from a Resolution Trust Corporation official whose name she did not know.    At his news conference with President Kravchuk today, Mr. Clinton sought to emphasize that with new procedures imposed on Thursday the White House has now erected a \"a clear and appropriate firewall\" to prevent further contacts between his aides and Federal investigations into Madison Guaranty and the Whitewater case.   Seeking to turn the focus to his critics' conduct, Mr. Clinton accused the Republicans of engaging in \"fairly blatant, bald and totally political\" efforts to make an issue of the meetings, in which he said he had not been accused of \"doing anything wrong.\"   The Senate Democratic aides who spoke of uneasiness about the turn the Whitewater case is taking said the chamber's leaders were already mulling over the possibility of Banking Committee hearings into the propriety of the meetings, if only to cut their political losses.   \"They have the discomfiting feeling of watching the Administration make every mistake they could think of,\" said one aide, who spoke only on the condition of not being identified. \"Now they're thinking, 'How many more town meetings can I go to before being asked about this? What do I say if I'm asked about it on 'Meet the Press?' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940305","headline":"Lost Daughter's Images Touch a Mother's Heart","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/05/nyregion/about-new-york-lost-daughter-s-images-touch-a-mother-s-heart.html","abstract":"  ON Dec. 22, Claire Avery, 82, left her retirement home in Stuart, Fla., and came to New York City to visit her 57-year-old daughter.

It's a modest work: a remodeled entrance and lobby in an old garment district loft building, along with a redesigned hallway on one of the upper floors. It is also modest in spirit. Mr. Ranalli, an architect known for spare geometric designs, has departed from his customary vocabulary and steeped himself in the style of an earlier day. He hasn't renounced his own esthetic. Rather, he's woven it into a vintage swatch of urban fabric. Synthetic blends may not be fashion's raiment of choice, but Mr. Ranalli's stylistic synthesis is a beauty.   Located at 575 Seventh Avenue (at 38th Street), the Fashion Center Building is hardly a traffic-stopping landmark. But the 24-story block of showrooms and offices is a rich part of the garment district's distinctive urban tissue. And while the building's architect, Henry Ives Cobb, is an obscure figure today, he was highly regarded at the turn of the century, chiefly on account of his master plan for the University of Chicago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"The Doctor Who Gave Silk Stockings a Second Life","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/arts/arts-artifacts-the-doctor-who-gave-silk-stockings-a-second-life.html","abstract":"  \"SAVE YOUR OLD SILK stockings,\" Sir Wilfrid Thomason Grenfell wrote in a 1928 issue of the Grenfell magazine, a quarterly that publicized his medical mission in what were then the British colonies of Newfoundland and Labrador.

A year later he renewed his plea, writing, \"When your stockings run, let them run to Labrador!\"    The silk and rayon stockings were ideal for hooked rugs, because they were readily available and absorbed dyes beautifully, especially pastels and earth tones.

Even though WYNY-FM (103.5) is one of the biggest country stations in America, it is pretty much the only game in town, and its playlist is limited to a narrow range of new-fangled contemporary stars.    For a hard-core country fix, listeners should turn to Laura Cantrell's \"Radio Thrift Shop\" on WFMU from 1 P.M. to 3 P.M. on Saturdays. Ms. Cantrell moves deep into the heart of honky-tonk, western swing, barn waltzes and rodeo songs. She concentrates on the classic period from the 40's to the 60's, when kings and queens like Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Bob Wills and George Jones ruled the Grand Ole Opry and continuously redefined the style for a changing rural America.    Like the best disk jockeys, Ms. Cantrell is part historian, part fan, part philosopher. While she has an active weakness for big names like Williams and Jones, she also has the breadth of knowledge to unearth plenty of forgotten gems. She is at her most revealing when she emphasizes the women of country: sassy mamas like Kitty Wells and Tammy Wynette, hot rockers like Wanda Jackson, unsung heroes like Molly O'Day and Dale Evans. Country music is a stereotypical bastion of conservatism, but Ms. Cantrell shows that these women were feisty long before feistiness was fashionable.    \"The Radio Thrift Shop\" presents country music as a living oral tradition. Ms. Cantrell is happy to throw in the occasional tidbit of juicy gossip: \"Hubert Davis was a drunk old banjo player around Nashville for a long, long time,\" she said after playing his ineffable ode to illicit romance, \"I Know You're Married but I Love You Still.\" And her taste extends beyond country into folk, blues, gospel and swing. When she juxtaposes a big band tune like Lee Wiley's \"I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues\" with Bob Wills's \"San Antonio Rose,\" she not only provides appropriate context, but brings unseen connections to light. At its best, country music can be as mean as the blues, as raucous as rock-and-roll, as romantic as the sweetest pop standard. Ms. Cantrell knows this, and she wants to share it. KAREN SCHOEMER SOUNDS OF YESTERDAY    In the wee hours of the morning, when WQEW, \"the home of American popular standards,\" ventures a little too far into Barry Manilow and Billy Joel territory, turn your AM dial a few notches to the left to WEVD (1050) and \"The Danny Stiles Nostalgia Extravaganza.\" Seven nights a week, from about 11 P.M. to 5:30 A.M., WEVD stands for \"wonderful, entertaining vintage disks,\" as Mr. Stiles digs up some of the coolest, strangest, funniest and most obscure recordings of the pre-rock era. He also broadcasts on Saturdays from 2 P.M. to 5 P.M. on WNYC-AM (820).   Mr. Stiles -- who refers to himself variously as the \"vicar of vintage,\" \"the raja of rare records\" and \"the doctor of archeological discology\" -- has a fascination for the forgotten: his area of expertise spans more than 100,000 albums, singles, 78's and old-time radio broadcasts from the late teens through the 50's.    Mr. Stiles, who has been a D.J. for 47 years, owns several different versions of Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher,\" and he remembers when Frank Sinatra was known as \"The Voice\" and \"Swoonatra.\" He holds names like Connee Boswell near to his heart, and reveres Al Jolson as the king he once was. Sometimes, just for a kick, Mr. Stiles will throw in an old country tune like Ray Price's \"Crazy Arms,\" because his program has no boundaries, playlists or limitations; his only guideline is his own idiosyncratic passion for a moment in pop history that is little more than a shadow.   Mr. Stiles's show harkens back to a time when radio was the mouthpiece for a national subconscious. He reads his own commercials for restaurants, pastry shops and plumbing supply stores, and he broadcasts from a make-believe art-deco studio on lower Broadway. Coming through the hazy AM band in the middle of the night, the needle of his turntable scratching through the grooves of ancient vinyl artifacts, he really does seem like the ghost of a lost but grander time.    There is a song that plays at the end of the film \"The Shining,\" a wierd, otherworldly tune called \"Midnight\" by the Ray Noble Orchestra. Like Jack Nicholson's character in the film, Mr. Stiles sees himself in the past. When he plays \"Midnight, the Stars and You\" on his radio show, he brings something long dead back to life. K.

Eventually Sadat's decision was reversed, and on Tuesday 11 of these ancient rulers went on view in a gleaming new installation with state-of-the-art display cases.

His multimedia company across the street, Ellipsis Arts, may bear an obscure address, Lumber Road, but no corner of earth is too remote for Mr. Charno and his staff of seven to explore.\n\nMr. Charno produces collections of spiritually charged and often forgotten music. Those musical documentaries include Balinese trance rituals, Pygmy yodels, Haitian voodoo rites, throat singing from Tuva, just north of Mongolia, in the former Soviet Union, Japanese sitting songs, American Indian squaw dances and Australian aboriginal music.\n\nIn the 18 months since he founded Ellipsis, Mr. Charno's efforts have won popular and critical acclaim.  \"Global Meditation,\" a four-CD collection of spiritual, ritual and meditative music from 40 countries and traditions, won the Billboard World Music Album award for 1993. \n\nLast year Mr. Charno worked with the United Nations when it declared 1993 its Year of Indigenous People.  He produced \"Voices of Forgotten Worlds,\" transporting listeners to 28 cultures, from a Mayan fiesta to a Tibetan monastery. A recording of contemporary African music has just been released, \"Africa: Never Stand Still,\" and a three-CD set, \"Trance,\" will appear in the spring.\nSecret of Success\n\n How does a native from Queens who has a degree in psychology and who calls himself a \"bad musician\" find himself marketing the music of far-flung lands? Combine Mr. Charno's fascination with with distant cultures, his business acumen and a holistic orientation, and a partial answer emerges. \n\nMr. Charno began as a distributor of health products and quickly expanded to include \"new age\" music. In 1985 he produced his first music series, \"The Art of Relaxation.\" The Relaxation Company, which he founded with his wife, Jenny, a massage therapist, focuses exclusively on products that enhance relaxation. \n\nMr. Charno became so intrigued by the music that he compiled a sampling of what sounded best. That was the start of Ellipsis, a venture separate from the Relaxation Company, he said. Sales from both concerns exceed a total of $2.5 million a year.  \"Ellipsis is an open-ended company, an indulgence,\" he explained. It is is named for the points denoting missing words. Each set of music is accompanied by booklets or books introducing little-known cultures.\n\nIn a 95-page companion book to \"Forgotten Worlds,\" the editor, Larry Blumenfeld, captures the appeal of world music by describing a concert by Tuvan throat singers in New York. \"With stringed instruments and hand percussion,\" he wrote, \"the ensemble establishes a simple rhythm reminiscent of the folk music of many areas. When the singing begins, two, three, four sounds emanate simultaneously from an individual singer, ranging from deep growls to high flutelike tones.\n\n\"In combination with one another, the singers create an almost otherworldly effect. The audience, mostly curious Americans, sits in rapt attention wearing looks of wonder. The Tuvans on stage grin.\"\n\n\"There's a growing hunger that people feel to find out who we share the planet with,\" Mr. Charno said. \"We're a restaurant to help people sample a meal.\" His kitchen, the office on Lumber Road, welcomes visitors with tinkling wind chimes, offers of herbal teas and a liberal sprinkling of Mr. Charno's laid-back humor. The conference room is dominated by a pool table used for relaxation, although it is covered for formal meetings. A conga drum rests in one corner. \n\n\"That's how Jeff calls us to meetings,\" Mr. Blumenfeld smiled.\n\nA large blackboard on the floor is fresh with marketing ideas, and the warehouse downstairs holds a gym that is convenient for Mr. Charno, the father of 6-month-old Emma.\n\nMr. Charno is proud of his cross-market appeal, which includes book and record stores and nature companies. \"Bookstores don't sell 'Pearl Jam,' but they sell 'Voices of Forgotten Worlds,' \" he said. \n\nMr. Charno has honed in on projects with a mixture of musical and political soul. The United Nations classifies 300 million people in 70 countries as indigenous, direct descendants of the original inhabitants of their land, and often oppressed by colonizers. \n\n\"The voices of indigenous people are beginning to be heard,\" Mr. Blumenfeld said. \"Politically they demand rights and representation. Environmentally they defend what they hold most dear, the land they've inherited. Culturally they teach us ways to farm, to heal and to look at life. The voices heard through this project are powerful. They say simply, 'Our land sounds like this.' \"\n\nAlthough Mr. Charno is sympathetic to the plights of indigenous people and donates a percentage of his sales to the United Nations Center for Human Rights, he insists that the music comes first. \"I'm not on the indigenous-people's rights bandwagon,\" he said. \"I resist the temptation to become preachy about it.\"\n\nYet Mr. Charno could not totally escape political implications. The United Nations halted further involvement because of \"a couple of cans of worms,\" he said, adding:\n\n\"The Chinese Government doesn't consider Tibetans to be an oppressed indigenous group. The Tibetans see their country as an occupied land.\" \n\nAn aboriginal people in Taiwan, the Bunun, posed a similar problem. After World War II many Chinese moved into their tribal areas.\n\n\"We wanted to respect political and social issues, but not be completely guided by them,\" Mr. Charno said.\n\nThrough photographs often obtained through The National Geographic, Mr. Charno said, he hoped to dispel misconceptions and infuse \"Voices of Forgotten Worlds\" with authenticity and reality. \"We tried to identify when people were in costume and when it was Tuesday afternoon at the market,\" he said. \"A photo of Tibetan monks shows them wearing vests and sneakers along with red robes and funky hats.\"\n\nMr. Blumenfeld interviewed 75 musicians around the globe by telephone.  He said he was moved by the stories of people like Nakamoto Matsuko, an Ainu woman who lives in Japan. \n\n\"My grandmother has an Ainu name,\" he quoted her in the book.  \"My mother and I don't. We can't have Ainu names, because the Government wants all the people to be Japanese. Assimilation policy means that we cannot speak Ainu.\"\n\nMr. Blumenfeld said it was \"an eye-opener to talk to people my age who weren't able to speak their mother's language in school.\"\n\n\"People are aware of dying species, plants, even cultures,\" he said.  \"But not much thought is given to languages that are disappearing by force. To me music is a language.\"\n\nThe American Indian musicians he interviewed were initially \"standoffish, defensive and suspicious of my motives, because they felt their tradition and music had been co-opted by the men's movement,\" Mr. Blumenfeld said. \nLove in a Rain Forest\n\n Mr. Blumenfeld was intrigued by stories like that of Louis Sarno, a New Jerseyan who fell in love with a Pygmy woman in a rain forest in the Central African Republic. \n\n\"Their music, which features exquisite polyphony, subtle calls and responses and distinct harmonies, is a reflection of the egalitarian nature of their society,\" Mr. Sarno told Mr. Blumenfeld. \"Everyone has a part, but alone it's nothing. When they come together they make this beautiful whole. The collaboration they have in their society is not forced. They cooperate out of their own heart.\"\n\n\"The idea of a community getting together to make music in a spontaneous way is deep,\" Mr. Charno said. \"I don't have that in my life.\"\n\n\"Music is simply a part of life for indigenous people,\" Mr. Blumenfeld added. \"It's not like hiring a band for a wedding. It's something you can't separate from the rest of life.\" In \"Forgotten People\" he describes as follows the simple musical traditions of the 100,000 Inuit people, inhabitants of the Arctic formerly known as Eskimos: \n\n\"High atop a hill overlooking a partially frozen sea, an elderly Inuit man beats a small, simple round drum with a wooden stick. He begins to sing a melodic chant over the beat as he turns his body left, and then right. Bending at the knees, he springs up again and again, moving the drum side to side, completely absorbed in the drum song.\"\n\nMr. Charno, too, is completely absorbed in his projects. Like a juggler balancing a half-dozen balls, he oversees the musical, marketing, legal, editorial, administrative and engineering aspects of his company. \n\nHe also knows when to delegate. His producer, Brooke Wentz, works on contacting record labels and archives to locate music that has already been recorded and listens to hundreds of hours to whittle down the choices. For Mr. Charno's newest project, a boxed set of flamenco music to be released in the fall, he has hired a Spanish expert. \n\nSome of the issues Mr. Charno has faced may seem simple, but he researches each one thoroughly. For instance, although all his projects are printed on recycled paper, he is ambivalent about its value. \n\n\"There's a lot of fluff about recycled paper, because it's not 100 percent recycled,\" he said. \"A lot of distinctions are not obvious to the consumer. It's a very sensitive issue, because customers want to know that companies are acting responsibly. Until we finish our own exploration I would rather err in the direction of safety, both environmentally and commercially. It's interesting and cool that companies can use environmental issues to further their commercial practices.\n\nFor Ellipsis projects other than \"Forgotten Worlds,\" Mr. Charno donates a percentage of sales to the Rainforest Alliance. So far that totals $15,000. He anticipates donating another $15,000 to the United Nations. \n\n\"Each person has his own joik, his own special song,\" says the Saami tradition of Scandinavia. Mr. Charno sings his joik through Ellipsis.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Summer Glories Passed Quickly, But Oh, the Fall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/arts/classical-music-summer-glories-passed-quickly-but-oh-the-fall.html","abstract":"  TO HEAR HER IS TO LOVE her: if anyone feels otherwise about Victoria de los Angeles, I don't want to know.

Even then she had the confidence to insist that she first be presented in recital in each city; this guaranteed a friendly core audience in the opera house, because the recitals were at such a level of expertise, novelty, spontaneous communication and indefinable stylistic savoir-faire that the singer could initiate a houseful of devoted admirers at each one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Missing: One Dog.

The flight skirts the coast of New South Wales above Sydney, grazing the city at the northern and southern headlands where the harbor forms; directly below the extended claw of South Head a crescent is carved, a sliver of sand where city meets surf. This is Bondi. The plane goes on, to land farther south at Botany Bay, but one can easily return by taxi or city bus.   Some will be disappointed. The city presses hard into Bondi (pronounced BONN-die), as it does to most of its 34 ocean beaches. The beach is not long, just over half a mile from end to end. Larger, less congested shores can be found up the coast in northern New South Wales or Queensland. But Bondi is where the Australian myth of surf and sand began, its surf life-saving club Australia's oldest -- the world's oldest, it asserts -- formed in 1906.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"In England, Sweeps of Bluebells","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/travel/in-england-sweeps-of-bluebells.html","abstract":"  THEIR color is almost impossible to describe -- a clear, deep azure that mysteriously seems to lighten in sun to shades of violet. On a showery April day, English bluebells glow with vibrant color: the blue of a sky washed clean, bright water in a quiet bay, a nest of robins' eggs, the implicit promise of iris and forget-me-nots. After a dark, cold winter, wild bluebells -- actually, wild hyacinths, officially identified either as Endymion nonscriptus, Scilla nutans or Hyacinthoidies nonscriptus -- suddenly appear in astonishing profusion for their brief blooming season, somewhere from late March to early May. Certain woodlands, where bluebells thrive in mottled shade, often look as if their spring housekeepers had flung out new bright blue carpets.   Although many visitors to England seek out the drifts of daffodils made famous by Wordsworth, few know exactly where or how to look for bluebells (the American bluebell, Mertensia virginica, is from a completely different family). Daffodils grow easily from bulbs planted almost anywhere. Bluebells are shyer and more elusive, true wildflowers clustering in damp areas along woodland paths. Those who want to find bluebells in their full glory must venture beyond London. Although a bluebell takes seven years to flower from seed, some woods are so thick with plants they become known in season as bluebell woods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Health Care for All, if Congress Doesn't Weaken","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/opinion/l-health-care-for-all-if-congress-doesn-t-weaken-389110.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Organized labor backs real health care reform.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Move Intended to Quiet Questions on Clinton's Land Deal Seems to Backfire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/us/move-intended-to-quiet-questions-on-clinton-s-land-deal-seems-to-backfire.html","abstract":"  There were many in the White House, including President Clinton, who hoped that the appointment in January of Robert B.

The ascendance of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Nirvana confirmed that the Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath fan clubs have never adjourned. Since the end of the 60's, the sound of suburban teen-agers coming of age has been the sound of grinding, stomping guitars and howling voices, holding the promise that turbulence can be converted to triumph.    Yet Seattle rock also twisted its 70's roots. Black Sabbath had sung about Satanism and apocalypse; Led Zepplin wailed mystical ruminations and testosterone blues. Seattle bands broke the link between power chords and extroversion; they turned inward and brooded, exploring endless variations on self-laceration and hopelessness. Songs were about the smoldering rage that goes with powerlessness, about the downward spiral of drug addiction, about cynicism so deep it couldn't even imagine humor. In the teen-age (and twentysomething) wasteland of the 90's, when neither jobs nor purpose are within easy grasp, guitar riffs weren't all that carried the music up the charts; the pervasive despair also hit home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"A Prisoner Perseveres And Wins Freedom","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/a-prisoner-perseveres-and-wins-freedom.html","abstract":"  Vincent James Landano was driving to his mother's house on Staten Island one day in 1976 when he passed several police cars leaving her street.

His name is now added to a growing groundswell of Long Island taxpayers who are coming to grips with this problem. In November of last year Tom Gulotta defeated Ben Zwirn in the contest for Nassau County Executive. The central issue in their bruising campaign was the onerous burden of taxes that the electorate now bears. Both candidates pledged to at least stop raising them. But Islandwide only 40 percent of the property taxes paid by this electorate goes to support governmental services. Sixty percent goes to fund the public schools on Long Island. Yet this huge 60 percent school-tax bill generates only a small fraction of attention from our state legislators and media that the 40 percent generates for governmental services. This must change.   In Rockville Centre, 78 percent of our $37 million budget goes toward school-district employees' salaries and fringes. The salary range of teachers goes from a starting salary of $35,000 a year to a high of $83,000 a year, and those figures do not include fringes or overtime. The average salary for all R.V.C. teachers is $59,419. But if you want a classic example of what 40 years of lobbying our school boards and state legislators by the teachers union, has accomplished it is the fact that in R.V.C. there are 363 salary classifications used to pay the 259 teachers in our system.

In recent years, most classical stations have followed a destructive philosophy of programming innocuous background music for a projected upper-class listenership. Snippets of Vivaldi or Johann Strauss mingle with luxury-life-style commercials and brainless chatter. Longer symphonic works are increasingly rare, vocal or chamber music nearly nonexistent; the 20th century slips in only by accident. The possibilities of the medium -- to explore wider repertory, to propagate new music, and to draw highlights from the limitless archives of recordings -- go largely unrealized.   With three classical stations, New York was once a haven for radio listeners. WNYC-FM, the public radio station, offered some remarkably adventurous new-music programming in the early 1980's, anchored by Tim Page's popular \"New, Old and Unexpected.\" WQXR-FM (96.3) and, to a lesser extent, WNCN still allowed music of substance into their commercial formats. But WNCN abandoned itself to the \"classical life style\" approach, then gave way to a rock format late last year, and playlists on the other stations have grown more and more timid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"The Real Scuttlebutt on the Cut of a Jib","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/the-real-scuttlebutt-on-the-cut-of-a-jib.html","abstract":"BECOME a sophisticate, or at least better versed, in dealing with the sometimes puzzling terms left over from the days of sailing ships. \n\n\"A B Seas: An Illustrated Dictionary of Sailors' Language,\" at the Maritime Center in Norwalk through April, helps unravel the language of the sea as it is brought to life with pictures, objects and interactive projects.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"'Up 'n' Irish '94' Show Now From Massapequa","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/up-n-irish-94-show-now-from-massapequa.html","abstract":"HE may sound like he is from Dublin or Donegal, but Andy Cooney, who headlines the \"Up 'n' Irish '94\" show at the Westbury Music Fair on Wednesday night, hails not from the \"old country,\" but from the relatively newer sod of Massapequa.\n\nThe performance will be Mr. Cooney's first at Westbury, but at 27 he is very much a show business veteran.

As technologically advanced as the sports have become, as dangerous and death-defying, the costuming remains curiously unexamined and embryonic. What the Olympics need is a Busby Berkeley, a man who used people, costumes and movement to create a third dimension on film. Such an Olympic visionary would be an athletic-wear designer and coordinator who takes into account the roughly 150 million of us who watch on television and who understands that uniform and costume design can enhance the thrill of a sport, even taking it to a new level. \n\nThe opening ceremonies are always promising in this regard. This time, officials handed out white ponchos to everyone in the stadium, to create the appearance of snow around the big world egg. It did look good, a stark background to those Gumbyish vette (Norwegian fairy) outfits. Those helium-filled plastic doves they let loose are a great televisual idea.

The only other time I saw Rothko's last paintings was at the Marlborough Gallery in 1970, a few months after his suicide, and they made a stark impression. In those unusually Minimalist works, the clouds of rich moody color that had characterized Rothko's mature work had been blasted away. All that remained were barren moonscapes: in work after work, single rectangles of gray met rectangles of black to form a bleak horizon.   Instead of exhaling, and suffusing the eye with soft color, these paintings inhaled, and held their breath. The rectangles almost seemed locked in a vise, thanks to the clean, hard lines of their edges, which, in contrast to Rothko's usual feathered borders, showed signs of taping. An emotional scale that had ranged from brooding to exultant to lyrical was collapsed into a single note of despair. The last Rothkos at Marlborough hinted at an artist who had reached a dead end. They appeared to be the logical prelude to death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Providing Decoration, an Artist Uses Glass of Many Colors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/providing-decoration-an-artist-uses-glass-of-many-colors.html","abstract":"FOR nearly 50 years, since he was a young man just out of the Navy, Earl Bihn has been obsessed with glass -- its colors and weights and the way that light reflects through or refracts.

Siphonators, which were combination coffee makers and hot water dispensers for making tea, were among the Edicraft products marketed in the late 1920's by Edison. Examples of the Edicraft products, also including toasters, waffle irons and sandwich grills, will be on display.   The \"Electric Servant\" program will be offered from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.

EMBLEN STAGE SOLOS    Of the numerous solo performers whose virtuosity has commanded a mostly bare stage in New York this season, Irene Worth and Spalding Gray are among the best known. The McCarter Theater in Princeton will be presenting each, if only for a single performance.   In the midst of what appears to be an Edith Wharton renaissance, Ms. Worth, who last year celebrated the 50th anniversary of her stage debut, is offering a reading -- her word is recital -- from the author's novels, including \"Ethan Frome\" and the 1933 autobiography, \"A Backward Glance.\"   Ms. Worth's \"Portrait of Edith Wharton,\" which she has described as \"an old-fashioned Victorian evening,\" is on tap tomorrow night at 8. It includes observations on New York's frivolous society, conversations with Henry James, memories of a first prepubescent kiss and sexual fulfillment at 45, but mostly, it is about the joy of writing.   Today from 5 to 7 P.M., Ms. Worth is also to discuss, with Arif Mardin, a composer, their new recording, \"Her Infinite Variety -- Irene Worth as the Women of Shakespeare,\" with a question and answer period afterward. The appearance, which is free, will be at the Betts Auditorium at Princeton University's School of Architecture at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Washington Road.   Audiences will have to wait until June 9 to hear Mr. Gray, in \"Gray's Anatomy,\" tell of his quest for a risk-free cure for an eye ailment: a \"macular pucker.\" Among the alternative medical practitioners he visited, he says, are a witch doctor in Borneo, a Filipino psychic surgeon and a quack in New Jersey.   The monologuist's Princeton appearance is to take place during the first week of his return engagement at the Mitzi E. Newhouse in Lincoln Center, where \"Gray's Anatomy\" played two performances a week for seven weeks earlier this season.   Tickets cost $17 to $22 for Mr. Gray and $18 to $22 for Ms. Worth, or, only for the Worth performance, $10 for students with ID. Reservations: (609) 683-8000. No tickets are required for Ms. Worth's appearance today.

Doctorow offers no criticism of the cliche about \"Uncle Tom's passive submission to his fate.\" Uncle Tom is beaten to death in two stages, first by fellow slaves at the order of Simon Legree, then by Legree himself, because of Tom's Christ-centered refusal to be dominated by Legree and to obey his orders. Legree in buying Tom saw him as a possible overseer. Legree is driven mad with exasperation and comes to hate Tom more and more, because Tom, far from being hardened by all the blows he has to endure, befriends first a fellow slave in the field who is not up to the punishing work and then Legree's quadroon ex-mistress, Cassy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/sports/transactions-386200.html","abstract":"  Hockey National Hockey League","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Play Area Lost in Bureaucracy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-play-area-lost-in-bureaucracy.html","abstract":"  Once again, spring is on its way, and once again, 550 grade-school students at P.S. 75 on West End Avenue and 96th Street will be using an empty paved lot for a playground.

In the advertising world, romance rarely flourishes between the creative and business sides. \"In creative, they call the account people 'suits,' \" Ms. Rudberg said. \"My boss at the time banned account people from coming onto the creative floor. Once, as a practical joke, somebody outlined a dead body in chalk on the floor and wrote, 'Account guy.' \"    Mr. Thibodeau, 28, is now working on commercials for Brute cologne at Lintas. Like an actor getting into character, he always wears Brute. Ms. Rudberg, 31, now works at the Lotas Minard Patton McIver agency, where she's known for wearing hats made of everything from fake leopard skin to fake green grass and for being the pickiest perfectionist in the office.    Judy Lotas, a partner in the agency, recently saw the movie \"Blink\" with the bride. \"The other people in the theater were screaming because it was sort of scary, but the only time Linda shrieked was when the female lead's lipstick had disappeared and she just had her naked lip liner on,\" Ms. Lotas said. \"Linda gets esthetically horrified.\"    The couple, who compared planning their wedding with working on a commercial together, spent a year organizing the event, which turned out to be stylishly homemade and personal, down to the tiniest detail.   For instance, a shower for the bride at her Upper West Side apartment was actually a poetry reading. She asked about 20 friends, all women, to bring poems, instead of kitchen utensils or lingerie, and read them aloud.    For the wedding invitations, the couple bought handmade paper that looked like granite -- blue with white and gray specks -- from an art supply store in the East Village; they had them printed by hand at SoHo Service. Even the vases for the wedding had the bride's colorful, quirky imprint on them. Ms. Rudberg, a potter, had made dozens of vases -- pink polka-dotted, striped and otherwise Dr. Seuss-inspired, each filled with a one-of-a-kind floral arrangement.   For the wedding, the couple scouted locations on the East Coast and eventually chose the Canfield Casino, an ornate, turn-of-the-century building in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Now city-owned, the casino has a carved oak bar, a gentleman's gambling room and a ballroom with a barrel ceiling decorated with stained-glass medallions the size of manhole covers.    At an interfaith ceremony on Feb. 19 -- she is Jewish, and he is Protestant -- the couple looked their account-creative parts. Mr. Thibodeau wore a dark conservative suit, while the bride appeared in an enormous tulle hat and a white cotton dress as simple as a monk's cassock. Guests compared the hat to everything from a cumulus cloud to a souffle to a geyser of Saratoga Springs sparkling water.    Dinner was served in the ballroom, where the ceiling medallions depict the 12 signs of the zodiac. Even they held a personal meaning for the bride and bridegroom: she is a Capricorn, and he is a Virgo, two very compatible signs.    As the bride recalled: \"After we met, my mother didn't ask, 'Is he Jewish?' She asked, 'What sign is he?' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/us/inside-381772.html","abstract":"  The Second Bomb Case   Having won convictions in the World Trade Center bombing, prosecutors turn to the coming trial of a blind cleric and others charged with a widespread terror plot.

The death of the Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski on Feb. 7, at the age of 81, inspired no radio dramatizations that I was aware of.

So you can decide the rivalry for yourself.   Although by American standards restaurants in Japan are expensive -- sometimes breathtakingly so -- prices are considerably lower at lunch; the four restaurants that follow are suggested for lunch. There is generally no tipping in Japan, but a tax of from 3 to 6 percent will be added to your final bill.

Konomi    A small restaurant nestled into the bustling Asakusa district near Kappabashi, Konomi offers exceptionally tasty kyobento that, at lunchtime, are remarkably reasonable in price. The top-of-the-line option between noon and 3 P.M. is the Kyobento Course, which for about $40 begins with an elegant arrangement of hors d'oeuvres and goes on to include a savory steamed custard, delicately herbed rice, miso soup and silky, jade-colored tea sorbet.

In a dizzying sprint, New York built upward and outward -- so quickly that its people were left thrilled, dazed and sometimes maddened by their new surroundings. The sense of wonder is long gone. But the freshness of the reaction can be found in the literature of the building of New York. The Bridge   . . . There was nothing in the average person's experience to compare to this spacious, beckoning, empty thoroughfare. It climbed up and out of the city like something seen in dreams. It was a highway people just naturally wanted to travel, even if they had no interest in the smaller, more sedate city they knew to be at the other end. To the New Yorker who lived within its shadow, it was not just a bridge to Brooklyn -- few New Yorkers had any special desire to go to Brooklyn -- it was a highway into the open air. When the day came when everyone could go out on it, when people by the tens of thousands could go up that road and through those colossal arches, they would go, they knew, not to Brooklyn, but to a place where sailing ships would glide like toys beneath their feet, where they could look down on the tallest buildings and their own mean, narrow streets and the people in them, where they could gaze out over land and water and everything man-made. \"What a relief it will be from the ill-smelling streets and stuffy shops,\" one man wrote. \"What a happy escape from those dreadful cabins on the ferryboats!\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"What the Frogs Are Telling Us","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/opinion/what-the-frogs-are-telling-us.html","abstract":"  A familiar harbinger of spring in much of North America is a tiny frog known to scientists as Hyla crucifer and to ordinary householders as the spring peeper. Beginning in March, male peepers in search of mates form a clamorous and joyful chorus, trilling around ponds and swimming pools. But the chorus has muted in recent years, in line with a mysterious worldwide decline in frogs, toads and other amphibians. Now there is evidence that what is silencing the peeper may be ultraviolet radiation resulting from a thinner ozone layer.    This hypothesis does not explain all disappearances: loss of habitat, pollution, acid rain are among other credible culprits. But scientists at Oregon State University have found that ultraviolet rays do deadly damage to the eggs of frogs and toads that have been vanishing from the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. This has to be of some interest to another bare-skinned species.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940306","headline":"Mexico City's Chapultepec Zoo Coming Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/travel/travel-advisory-mexico-city-s-chapultepec-zoo-coming-back.html","abstract":"  The Chapultepec Park Zoo in Mexico City, is scheduled to reopen in May after nearly two years of renovations.

Such solidarity has served the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Urban League and other traditional organizations very well.
