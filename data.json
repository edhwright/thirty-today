Those with incomes over $200,000 would get, on average, an annual tax reduction of $11,266, while taxpayers with incomes between $30,000 and $50,000 would have an average tax cut of only $569.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950407","headline":"Inside Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/arts/inside-art.html","abstract":"  Getting Caught in the Web    Thea Westreich is a newbie.

Mr. Rihm, one of the more interesting composers working in Germany today, is an eclectic, and in \"Fremde Szene II,\" the trio's offering on Tuesday, he weaves shards of Romanticism into a texture that is by turn eerie, vehement, harsh and lyrical.    Those diverse qualities may seem a lot to pack into a single-movement, 20-minute work, but Mr. Rihm writes in a fluid style that makes the progression seem natural. At the same time, he moves back and forth between true interplay and apparent chaos. Often the violin and cello pursue a theme in tandem while the piano explores music of an entirely different character; yet a moment later the three lines are closely intertwined.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950407","headline":"Dim Outlook in Philadelphia Strike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/us/dim-outlook-in-philadelphia-strike.html","abstract":"  With business off as much as 15 percent, Chris Carbonara and Chris Doyle have marked down the entrees they sell from their lunch wagon outside Philadelphia Community College.

His spare yet ever-expanding vocabulary includes white grid sculptures capable of a nearly Piranesian complexity, and a profusion of wall drawings in pencil and bright ink that have left few geometric stones unturned. These drawings are executed by assistants following written instructions whose fusion of the linguistic, the visual and the philosophical makes them a minor art form in their own right. With Mr. LeWitt's photographs, prints and drawings on paper taken into account, no one except Donald Judd has so thoroughly overturned the notion of the Minimal while remaining true to first principles.   At the moment, three sides of Mr. LeWitt's complex sensibility are visible in exhibitions in SoHo and the South Village, more than Manhattan has seen in some time. A show of enormous sculptures at Ace Gallery New York is buttressed by an exhibition of wall drawings at the Lawrence Markey Gallery and a show of 45 working drawings on paper at the John Weber Gallery, the artist's longtime representative.

Thus it has made the planet feel slightly cooler, even as nations continue to pump into the sky ever greater quantities of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause global warming.\n\n Nearly all the ash from Mount Pinatubo has now fallen back to earth, settling on our soil, water and forests, but also, it seems, clouding our minds.

Green has never been a terribly welcome figure in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's City Hall, but yesterday he found himself banned even from a city-owned center for the elderly after the Giuliani administration decided that a forum he planned on the Republican Party's Contract With America was a political activity prohibited on city property.    As a result, Mr. Green and Thomas M. Menino, the Mayor of Boston and a fellow Democrat, met with about 40 older people on the sidewalk yesterday morning at 93d Street and First Avenue, outside the Stanley M. Isaacs Senior Center, which the Housing Authority owns. Afterward, Mr. Green charged that Ruben Franco, the chairman of the Housing Authority, had engaged in \"big-brother censorship.\" But Mr. Franco and Mr. Giuliani said they were only trying to protect the city's Federal housing money.    The dispute began on Wednesday, when Mr. Green notified the Housing Authority that he and six big-city mayors -- all Democrats -- planned to discuss the Contract With America, the Republican policy agenda that has been the focus of the first 100 days of the Congressional session, at the center. A day later, Mr. Franco called the center and said the event was prohibited, citing Housing Authority regulations that say, \"In no case may community center space be used for partisan political activities.\"    Mr. Franco informed Mr. Green as well, but the Public Advocate, a likely mayoral candidate, decided to show up anyway. He and Mr. Menino spent the morning telling older people on the sidewalk how Federal policies will affect them, and then he spent the afternoon telling reporters on the sidewalk outside City Hall about the damage done to the First Amendment.    \"Here we have a city official who is engaging in classic prior restraint because he has decided to ban me from speaking because of his guess about the political content of what we might say,\" said Mr. Green, who was joined by Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.    City officials defended their decision by noting that all the mayors invited to the forum were from the same party, and suggested that only one side of the Contract With America would have been presented.    \"I know the mayors that were here came for a meeting that was sponsored by the Democratic National Committee to raise money,\" said Mr. Giuliani, explaining why the mayors had come to New York in the first place. \"So it would have been very hard to escape the fact that what Mark Green was organizing here was a partisan political event.\"    Mr. Giuliani himself has given the Contract With America mixed reviews, saying that he agrees with parts of it and disagrees with others.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"IN PERFORMANCE: POP","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/arts/in-performance-pop-790095.html","abstract":"  Trumpets and Guitar Over a Tuba's Beat  Spanish Fly   Mercury Lounge","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"Private Offshore Trust Business May Soon Bloom in Dublin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/your-money/IHT-private-offshore-trust-business-may-soon-bloom-in-dublin.html","abstract":"EUROPE'S fastest-growing offshore financial center may soon be open for business from private investors, if Dublin accountants and lawyers have their way. .The International Financial Services Centre, or IFSC, at Dublin's Custom House Docks has attracte","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"Hockey; Rangers Roll Out a Welcome Mat for the Islanders","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/sports/hockey-rangers-roll-out-a-welcome-mat-for-the-islanders.html","abstract":"  It is becoming increasingly apparent that this might not be another Year of the Rangers.

Mr. Ajmone-Marsan has a good effect on his young pit orchestra, which played not just with competence but also with style and understanding.   Opera has a way of heightening human passions by simplifying relationships. Thus the Edouard Blau libretto embraced by Massenet is about star-crossed love: lovers wrapped in a hopeful embrace that will never really be. Goethe's Werther is more interesting because his life is lived on the inside. He is the ruminating delusionary to whom Albert and Charlotte, a devoted couple, remain loving friends until death.

in Point Lookout, L.I., a quaint beach town. Yards were tiny, with most space taken up by patios. At the far end of our concrete patio was a small raised bed garden, about 2 feet by 15 feet. A three-foot-high white brick wall topped by several feet of white lattice served as the back of the garden and the property boundary.\n\nIn that small space, we grew tomatoes, morning glories and climbing roses -- all trained upward. One year, small melon and cucumber vines twined up the lattice. Low-growing annual flowers tucked in among the other plants provided accents. A honeysuckle plant thrived in a corner, climbing onto the garage. On long summer evenings, the contrast of the dark plants against the lattice made the garden a thing of mystical beauty, even after sunset.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950409","headline":"That Man In a Cape Is Still Flying","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/arts/television-view-that-man-in-a-cape-is-still-flying.html","abstract":"  O.K., SO THIS TIME HE DIDN'T LEAP TALL ratings obstacles in a single bound.

When the two shows squared off on Sundays at 8 P.M. a season and a half ago, they were battling for a network audience left over from CBS's long-running and still enormously popular \"Murder, She Wrote.\" Older viewers are fiercely loyal to Angela Lansbury. ABC and NBC aimed for a younger market, the 18-to-49 crowd.

Classical tradition is premised not on a robotic replication of the composer's instructions but on a vital re-creation of the score in the heat of the present. Yet it is possible for a performance or recording to document the composer's original idea with uncommon precision. Two recently released symphonic cycles make bids toward authenticity in very different ways: John Eliot Gardiner's period-instrument Beethoven survey on Archiv (436 900-2; five CD's) and a reissue of 1950's broadcast performances of Carl Nielsen's symphonies on Danacord (351/3; three CD's).   Mr. Gardiner created the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique six years ago in anticipation of a Beethoven cycle, and its name proclaims his intention. He wants the primal, brazen shock of Beethoven's orchestration, with its thudding timpani, blaring woodwinds and militant brass. He wants to show Beethoven's connection to French revolutionary contemporaries like Gossec and Mehul. He wants a smaller orchestra so that Beethoven's harmonic and rhythmic surprises stand out more clearly. He wants brisk tempos that whip up a Toscaninian atmosphere of excitement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950409","headline":"In Fallen Chechen Capital, Medical Care Is in Ruins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/world/in-fallen-chechen-capital-medical-care-is-in-ruins.html","abstract":"  Grozny's Hospital No. 4, one of only three hospitals still open in this city eviscerated by war, is barely functioning, with most of its buildings in ruins.

Narrow lanes were clogged with exhaust-belching motorbikes and trucks. The muddy main street of Ubud was lined with thatched lean-tos -- as well as T-shirt shops, Fuji film signs, placards advertising cheap plane tickets, vegetarian restaurants and, considering this was off-season, a surprising number of Westerners.

Why is that scaffolding still around the Paramount Building (the old Gulf & Western Building) on Columbus Circle? Is there any hope of its being removed?  A.  First the good news. Donald J. Trump, whose company now manages the building, at 15 Columbus Circle, says the scaffolding will be removed in three weeks.    Now for the bad news. It'll immediately be replaced with what Mr. Trump calls \"new, improved, more beautiful scaffolding.\"    The 50-foot-tall scaffolding was initially put up in December 1993 to keep pedestrians from getting hit by falling glass windows. The 44-story building has structural defects: it pops its windows as it twists perceptibly in high winds.    The building is being transformed into the Trump International Hotel and Tower, a combination hotel and luxury apartment rental.   The Trump Organization along with the Galbreath Company manages the building with the General Electric Pension Trust, the current owners.    They are stripping down the building to the metal, reinforcing the structure, and putting up a \"new skin\" designed by Philip Johnson: bronze with silver accents and floor-to-ceiling bronzed glass.    Mr. Trump says the new scaffolding will have \"great signage and lights\" and will be up at least until the end of the year. And the windows will pop no more, they say.  If the Sticker Lies . . .    Q.  I often find it difficult, if not impossible, to open the back doors on city buses. This despite the sticker on the door that says all you have to do is touch the yellow tape. Why, why, why? A.  Patience, weary passenger. Or strength!   That's actually an either-or proposition: Either you're pushing too hard when the doors want to open in their own good time, or the sensor's not working and you're stuck hefting their true weight.    Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, says the doors are designed to open on their own. A hard push on the tape to hurry them up will only meet resistance. \"So touch it lightly,\" Mr. Seaton says, \"and be patient.\"    On the other hand, he admits, the strip could be damaged by vandalism or simple wear and tear, leaving the doors -- extra wide to accommodate wheelchairs, and therefore extra heavy -- susceptible only to brute strength.    There are 3,700 New York City Transit Authority Buses and the majority have electronic sensor technology. Mr. Seaton says that each bus is periodically checked to make sure the sensors are working. Green Arm of the Law   Q.  How much legal authority do park rangers wield? I was recently ticketed at my Manhattan Beach park for having my dog off the leash. When I couldn't produce I.D., the surly ranger threatened to arrest me for vagrancy. How much intimidation must I tolerate? Must I carry I.D. to walk around my own neighborhood? A.  Rangers can indeed arrest you. The 40 Urban Park Rangers in New York City and the 200 officers in the Park Enforcement Patrol (called PEP officers) who patrol the city's 1,560 park properties are authorized to issue summonses, request identification, take someone into custody and bring the person to the police station, i.e., make an arrest.   \"They are trained, certified peace officers,\" said Alexander Brash, chief of Urban Park Service, which oversees both units.    The rangers and PEP officers go through eight weeks of training on Randalls Island and carry batons, pepper gas and handcuffs (but no guns). The rangers wear big-brimmed Smokey Bear-type hats; the PEP officers' hats are more like the ones worn by state troopers.    In 1994, the two groups made 170 felony arrests (for crimes like setting a car on fire) and confiscated 116 weapons (mostly knives). And they issued 7,866 environmental summonses, 9,774 parking violations (mainly to people who drove on the grass) and 1,010 criminal court summonses.    And, if they see an offense being committed on park property and they are in uniform, they can even follow the perp out of the park.    But if you think that a park officer is not acting within these constraints, you can complain to the Urban Park Service, (212) 360-2781. MONIQUE P.

The Heusels didn't want to spend last Saturday in Washington, where they were on vacation. It was April Fool's Day, and they wanted to dosomething foolish. They impulsively spent $102 for a pair of round-trip Amtrak tickets for their first trip to the Boardwalk -- which was also their first train ride.   They boarded the 9 A.M. at Union Station. They arrived in Atlantic City at 12:25 P.M. and took a bus to a casino, the Sands, where they were given $10 in coins. Not only did they win back the cost of the trip when they got lucky on the slot machines; they witnessed the end of an era.    Along with 101 other passengers that night, the Heusels were on the last Amtrak run out of Atlantic City. After the 10:15 rumbled out of the rail terminal, Amtrak closed its ticket office and removed just about everything but the tracks, hoping to shave $4.6 million from its budget.    The end of Amtrak's six-year run did not mean the end of rail transportation to Atlantic City, which is still provided by New Jersey Transit. But for people like the Heusels, going to Atlantic City by train would no longer be an effortless caprice.    They would have to want to go badly enough to travel first to Philadelphia's 30th Street Station and leave the comparatively luxurious Amtrak coaches, with their burgundy reclining seats, convivial cafe cars and easy-to-find restrooms, for a New Jersey Transit train that makes a half-dozen stops each way; has no reclining seats, running water or food car, and doesn't get you free coins from casinos. (The New Jersey Transit fare is lower: $6 each way on the Philadelphia-Atlantic City run, compared with $9 on Amtrak.)    \"It's really too bad,\" Mr. Heusel said, getting coffee in the cafe car. \"I could really get to like this.\"    On the platform, Richard Del Bono, the engineer on the 10:15, solemnly embraced saddened Amtrak employees. \"This is an emotional moment,\" he said. \"I ran the first train down here in 1989, and now I'm riding the last one out.\"    Though Amtrak's era in Atlantic City is hardly long enough to be called an era, the railroad era is something else. The city's initial prosperity was based on the ease with which day-trippers from Philadelphia and New York could board a train and, within a few hours, inhale the salt breeze.    A railroad conductor, Alexander Boardman, invented the city's Boardwalk. In the 1930's, the city had two train terminals, one at South Carolina Avenue, the other at what has become the bus terminal, at Missouri and Arctic Avenues.    The railroads left Atlantic City in 1982, victims of the automobile and the casino bus. But when bus-exhaust pollution levels began to rival those at the Lincoln Tunnel, the county improvement authority spent $20 million for a new terminal to adjoin a new convention center (now under construction and scheduled to open in 1996). Amtrak paid for repairs and track improvements; the state built or restored stations along the line.   Amtrak and the casino industry had high hopes for the train. Amtrak added a first-class club car and encouraged chartered junkets for high rollers. Some casinos offered coin refunds to passengers. And New Jersey Transit began commuter service for casino employees.    But Amtrak never quite got enough warm bodies. For last few years, its trains were rarely more than half full.    \"It meant a lot to some people,\" said the conductor on the 10:15, Earl Davisson, who, instead of punching tickets, was autographing them. \"We had our regulars we'd see every week. There was a group up in Connecticut that would charter a whole car once or twice a year. We had birthday parties all the time.    \"Now I hear we might be back when they get the convention center open. But then again we might not. Nobody thought we'd be back when they stopped in '82, but here we are. Or were.\"    He signed a ticket. \"Nothing's forever.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950409","headline":"Met Titles: A Ping-Pong Of the Mind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/arts/classical-view-met-titles-a-ping-pong-of-the-mind.html","abstract":"  \"OVER MY DEAD BODY,\" JAMES LEVINE proclaimed a few years ago about proposals to project texts on screens during Metropolitan Opera performances.

The task of bringing them to public attention has repeatedly fallen to writers and photographers.

At the end of the century, photographers stepped in, but in the aftermath of World War I, as prosperity rapidly advanced in America, poverty retreated from sight once more.    The Depression brought it roaring back, with photographers in its train. Another world war produced another period of prosperity and silence, and then, in 1962, Michael Harrington made the poor visible again by pointing out their invisibility in \"The Other America.\" Today, of course, the urban poor are always in view.

They may be seething inside, but on the surface they are composed.   Mr. Hartley is no ordinary film maker. His timing is offbeat, his narratives off center. He often directs his actors as precisely as if he were choreographing them, down to the tilt of their head and the angle of their gaze. His protagonists are as likely to be women as men.

But fish biologists are anxiously counting the first shad to show up in the Connecticut River (the run usually begins in early April and continues into June) hoping that the river's population will not continue a dramatic decline that began to be noted during the spring of 1993 and continued through 1994.\n\nIn 1994 more than a million shad were missing in the Connecticut River alone, said Thomas Savoy, a state Department of Environmental Protection fish biologist. Scientists expected about 1.5 million shad last spring. But only about 300,000 made it. Even more troubling, since fish return to the waters where they were spawned, the decline could be self-perpetuating. Some fish biologists anticipate that only 100,000 shad, or even fewer, may appear in the Connecticut River this spring. If that happens, it will raise serious questions about the long-term survival of the Connecticut River shad run. Every river that runs into the Atlantic Ocean between the Canadian maritime provinces and northern Florida has a shad run, said Richard St. Pierre, a United States Fish and Wildlife Department fish biologist. And in every major river where shad surveys are done, scientists in 1993 and 1994 noted a severe population decline. The shad that did make it were for some reason much smaller than they should have been, Mr. St. Pierre said. The best theory that fish biologists have is that the shad's troubles could be related to a sharp rise in the population of larger striped bass, Mr. Savoy said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950409","headline":"WHAT'S DOING IN;\nIndianapolis","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/travel/whats-doing-in-indianapolis.html","abstract":"The Indianapolis 500 is not until May 28, and most events leading up to it do not begin until early May.

This is a large portion of ham; in fact, if one were redesigning the sandwich, there might be a little less ham and a bit more bacon. But then again, the ham-heavy Student Special has certainly stood the test of time. MICHAEL KAGAY    The Annex, 128 1/2 Nassau Street, Princeton, (609) 921-7555.

It is instead a particular family's story, an account of how one clever woman, long ago in a Polish shtetl, managed to save her household. Like all of Mr. Mamet's work, this dark little tale is laced with foreboding and imminent violence. It is also rife with trademark Mametian dialogue; the aborted, unfinished sentences have an edgy, staccato rhythm that creates an undercurrent of tension. The setting is one of pure domesticity: an older woman and her granddaughter are in the kitchen preparing food for the seder table. They are making haroset, the mix of apples, raisins, honey, walnuts and wine that symbolizes the mortar used to bind the bricks of ancient Egypt. As the young girl cuts up the apples and chops the nuts, bits and pieces of family lore are revealed. The grandmother has been in the Israeli Army; the samovar brought over from the old country, which an aunt had made into a lamp, has disappeared; but great-great-great grandmother Clara's candlesticks have been saved. Inevitably, since this is a Mamet story, attention is focused on the knife the girl is wielding. And a large, glittering chef's knife figures ominously in many of Michael McCurdy's beautifully rendered drawings. The young girl asks if this was the knife Clara had used, so many years earlier, to thwart death. Her grandmother then tells how Clara, during a pogrom at Passover, created a scene of bloody devastation that fooled the enemy. The rampaging Cossacks miraculously passed over Clara's house; her family survived to tell the tale. The story echoes back to the Jews of ancient Egypt, who marked their homes with blood, avoiding the Angel of Death. But it is also a modern-day parable of survival, a Passover story that in only a few dozen riveting pages showcases Mr. Mamet's fascination with lies, duplicity and a reality that is not quite what it seems.

Now that his sons, Robert Jr. and Tom, are running the business, Mr. Dorsi had time to answer some questions about his hometown.   Q.  So what's Long Hill like?   A.  We've got a little of everything. We have wooded areas. We've got the Passaic River, and we've got the Great Swamp, which runs into Long Hill and Chatham and Madison. People are always running and bicycle riding, especially in the summer, when a lot of people come from the city and get off at the train station with their packs.   Before, we had Italian and Polish and Armenian people, mostly. Now, it's just mixed. We're just getting better people all the time -- better educated, more money. We don't have anyone here who's that famous. Leo the Lion, the MGM symbol, was pretty heavy here about a year ago. People came from all over to see where he was buried. Now it's died out; I heard the owners took the headstone away because they want to sell the property.   Q.  What are people in Long Hill talking about these days?   A.  A few years ago, the new people didn't like the name Passaic Township, which was what Long Hill was called for a long time. So there was a vote, and people changed the name to Long Hill. Long Hill sounds a little richer, like Short Hills. People used to get us confused with Passaic, over there near Clifton. The old people didn't like this when the name changed; they never said Passaic Township, they just said Millington, Stirling, Gillette, Meyersville or Homestead Park -- those are the villages that are part of Long Hill. But now you never hear anything about Passaic. People say either Long Hill or Stirling or Gillette.   Property is worth a lot of money here, and people are worried about all the stores coming in now, like T.J. Maxx and Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's. All the land is just about saturated. They're building a new development now -- Stirling Manor, I think it's called. They're going to build about 60 homes on the hill, and the cheapest you can get is $375,000.   Q.  Has the town changed?   A.  Years ago, you knew everyone by their first name, their last name, where they lived. Now you don't know. You do meet a lot of nice people; we've got a lot of lawyers, dentists and doctors and F.B.I. people. You see almost the same people every day, and you try to talk to them a little. We have the lottery here at the store; that brings in a lot of people. It's just that everybody's in a hurry.   TV and the malls have changed a lot of people. These new people have got a landscaper and a gardener; they sleep late on Sunday, take the kids to the mall, stay all day. It isn't like when families got up early, went together to get a bun or rolls, got the morning paper, went back home and read it at home. We open at 6:30 every day. The early birds are all old-timers coming in for coffee, doughnuts and rolls. We try to satisfy everybody; that's what kept me here so long. I want to retire, but my sons always need help. It's O.K.; I've got to do something. DAVID W.

But that recipe is actually too simple. A real home theater system implies hi-fi sound and then some; it involves the same 360-degree sonic environment (\"surround sound\") that provides at least half the thrill of experiencing \"Jurassic Park\" at the Bijou.

Here is a summary of the major cases and the officers who have been charged. 30TH PRECINCT, HARLEM   In August 1993 several Harlem police officers were videotaped breaking into an apartment that had been set up by undercover officers as a phony drug den. The sting operation, which followed reports that officers had been shaking down drug dealers and stealing property on their beats opened up one of the city's biggest police corruption scandals in decades. In the days and months that followed, more than two dozen other officers and supervisors were arrested. The most recent arrests came last week, when two officers and a sergeant were accused of falsifying arrest records and lying in court to win convictions.   Peter Allgor -- assault -- case pending   Jorge Alvarez -- grand larceny -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending    John Arena -- drug conspiracy -- acquitted   David Benitez -- extortion -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Edward M.

Thus began the Morgue Boy's investigation. In a trial that ended on Tuesday, jurors acquitted three officers of extortion charges but deadlocked on civil rights charges stemming from what prosecutors said were illegal searches and arrests based on false evidence.   Christopher Banke -- obstruction of justice -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Philip Carlucci -- conspiracy -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Kevin Hembury -- conspiracy -- pleaded guilty, sentence pending   Keith Goodman -- extortion, conspiracy -- acquitted   civil rights violations -- mistrial   Frank Mistretta -- extortion, conspiracy -- acquitted   civil rights violations -- mistrial   Richard Sanfilippo -- extortion, conspiracy -- acquitted   civil rights violations -- mistrial 109TH PRECINT, QUEENS   Early last year the Police Department received a series of complaints form residents in and around Flushing that several officers were using drugs on the job. Four officers were ordered to take drug tests: one resigned and the other three failed their tests and were dismissed. The department also set up a series of corruption stings, resulting in the arrests of two officers and one former officer, who are accused of stealing $1,400 while responding to a false report of a kidnapping. Police officials say more officers are under investigation.    Anthony Biancaniello -- grand larceny -- case pending   Joseph DiGregorio -- grand larceny -- case pending   John Pylyp -- grand larceny -- case pending   48TH PRECINCT, THE BRONX   The 48th Precinct is the latest focus of corruption inquiries, with two dozen officers currently under investigation, police officials say. After sting operations involving undercover officers posing as drug dealers, eight officers from the 48th have been placed on desk duty, and officials say that indictments of more than a dozen more could come as early as this week. One of the officers on desk duty, Timothy Zaccardo, has also been charged by the Rockland County District Attorney with participating in a suburban cocaine ring. Officers from the 48th are believed to have robbed drug dealers, sold narcotics and beat up suspects.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950409","headline":"The Apocalypse in Paris","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/books/the-apocalypse-in-paris.html","abstract":"PARIS BABYLON \nThe Story of the Paris Commune.\nBy Rupert Christiansen.\nIllustrated. 435 pp. New York: \nViking. $23.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950409","headline":"Douglas Gardner, Jennifer Radding","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/style/weddings-douglas-gardner-jennifer-radding.html","abstract":"  Jennifer Ty Radding, a daughter of Linda and Edward Radding of Longmeadow, Mass., was married in New York last evening to Douglas Benjamin Gardner, the son of Charlotte and Joseph Gardner of New York.

Was this treaty worth the paper it was written on?
