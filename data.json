This is a considerable moral victory for the opposition, and a vindication of Western pressure. Mr. Moi has held office since 1978, having succeeded Kenya's first President, Jomo Kenyatta.

From the perspective of Ping Chong's far reaching performance piece, Japan found a symbolic certification for its world economic supremacy through the acquisition of masterpieces of Western art. In other words, it has become the land of the rising \"Sunflowers.\"   In previous works like \"Kind Ness\" and \"Nosferatu,\" Mr. Chong has dealt incisively with American and European myths and traditions, and in others he has soared into the futuristic. Rarely has he approached subjects of an Asian nature, a fact for which he fully compensates in \"Deshima\" (at La Mama Annex). This is an ambitious attempt to probe ancestral roots as well as ancestral trade routes and to dramatize the reverberations between disparate cultures. He studies economic as well as political imperialism.

During the boycott, a bitter nine-month stalemate between Hollywood producers and New York film unions, the major studios virtually shut down film making in the city. Not only has the number of movie productions in New York been sharply reduced ever since, the report says, but the boycott has also caused a lasting talent drain of actors and production and technical workers, many of whom have moved to the West Coast. That exodus has reduced the available pool for theater in New York as well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930107","headline":"Stranger in a Strange Land: Muslim in Serb Army","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/world/stranger-in-a-strange-land-muslim-in-serb-army.html","abstract":"  When Muslim soldiers of the Bosnian Government fight their way up the precipitous slopes of Mount Trebevic in an effort to break the siege of Sarajevo, Edin Lazovic and his fellow commandos are there to stop them.

Only three months ago, pain from his herniated thoracic disk still riveted much of his upper torso, and the greatest scorer in hockey seemed resigned to retirement at age 31. On airplane trips, he would need permission from flight attendants to lay flat on the floor. In a restaurant once, he lay spread-eagled on the carpet to ease his back pain, and an unknowing waitress assumed he was drunk.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930107","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/nyregion/c-corrections-250893.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday about the funeral of the Rev.

Labor Accord Is Reached, Allowing Free Agency for Players","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/us/pro-football-nfl-labor-accord-is-reached-allowing-free-agency-for-players.html","abstract":"  Five years of bickering, bargaining and court battles came to an end today when the National Football League and its players agreed to a seven-year contract that, for the first time in the history of the sport, gives veteran players the freedom to move to other teams.   For owners, the agreement brought a landmark as well: the right to impose a salary cap, enabling them to hold down the earnings of players and somewhat blunt the impact of free agency. Thus, the movement of players in football will most likely not resemble the mad scramble that characterizes baseball, but rather the more restrained movement in the National Basketball Association, which also has a salary cap.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930107","headline":"New Cuban-Americans Also Oppose Castro; Change Old Attitudes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/opinion/l-new-cuban-americans-also-oppose-castro-change-old-attitudes-299093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"A Bridge to Cuba\" (Op-Ed, Dec. 18), Prof. Ruth Behar, a second-generation Cuban-American, urges rapprochement with her native land.

Quebec Makes 'Em Quiver  The Quebec Nordiques, perennial Adams Division doormats, moved into first place last night when Andrei Kovalenko connected on an overtime goal to give the Nor diques a 3-2 victory over the Bruins in Boston. Kovalenko got his 15th goal of the season at 1 minute 35 seconds of overtime. Claude Lapointe passed from the left boards to the left side of the slot, where Kovalenko one-timed a 30-footer to the left of goalie John Blue. The Nordiques, 6-1 in their last seven games, have 54 points, a point more than Montreal. They had just 52 all last season. Boston, 1-5 in its last six games, had its seven-game unbeaten string against the Nordiques broken. (AP) North Stars 6, Penguins 3: Ulf Dahlen scored three goals and Russ Courtnall added two more as Minnesota, taking advantage of the absence of Mario Lemieux, defeated the Penguins on Pittsburgh ice. Dahlen registered his third career hat trick and the first by a North Star in 41 games this season. On Wednesday night, Lemieux left Pittsburgh's game against Boston in the second period, complaining of a stiff back. He has since been ordered by doctors to rest his back until Jan. 25, and last night he watched from a private box as the Penguins' six-game unbeaten streak came to an end. (AP) Flyers 8, Capitals 2: Kevin Dineen broke out of a slump with three goals as Philadelphia crushed visiting Washington. Philadelphia, which has just one loss in its last five games (3-1-1), recorded its 999th franchise victory. Washington, which had been unbeaten in its last four games (2-0-2), suffered its first loss against a Patrick Division opponent in its last eight games (6-1-1). Dineen notched the Flyers' first goal at 5:43 of the first period off a scramble in front. Dineen had just two goals in his previous 20 games and 2 points in his last eight contests. His hat trick last night leaves him with 11 goals for the season. (AP) Blues 3, Flames 2: Brendan Shanahan, suspended by the league earlier in the day for a stick-swinging incident, scored on a 15-foot slap shot with 2:02 left in overtime to give St. Louis the victory at home. Shanahan was suspended for six non-game days without pay for hitting Minnesota's Mike Craig in the face with his stick on Dec. 22. In last night's game, Shanahan took a pass from Nelson Emerson in the right circle and fired the puck past goalie Mike Vernon to give the Blues consecutive victories for the first time since Oct. 31. (AP) Oilers 3, Blackhawks 3: Steve Larmer's second goal of the game with 5:38 left in the third period earned host Chicago the tie. Larmer took a pass from Michel Goulet, who had circled the Oilers' net as goaltender Bill Ranford was shoved into the net, and jammed the puck over the goal line. It marked the 11th straight season that Larmer, playing in his 843rd straight game, has scored 25 goals. (AP) N.B.A.  Spurs Cast a Spell  Dale Ellis scored a season-high 33 points and David Robinson added 16 as the San Antonio Spurs won at home over the Utah Jazz, 109-99, the Spurs' third victory over the Jazz this season. San Antonio, in second place in the Midwest Division, pulled within four games of Utah. The Jazz's six-game winning streak was stopped. (AP) Trail Blazers 113, Rockets 91: Cliff Robinson scored 21 points and Portland took advantage of the Rockets' 19-point fourth quarter for a road victory in Houston. Portland won its third straight victory, and the Rockets lost their sixth game in a row. Portland didn't lead until it went on 19-8 run over the final 7:13 of the third quarter. Houston went scoreless for 2:40 during Portland's run. (AP) Hawks 100, Bucks 94: Stacey Augmon scored 20 points, including two key baskets to keep Atlanta comfortably ahead in the final minute, and Kevin Willis added 18 points and 14 rebounds as Atlanta won in Milwaukee to end a four-game losing streak. Frank Brickowski had 24 points and Eric Murdock 19 for the Bucks, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. (AP) Suns 111, Mavericks 107: The best team in the league had to rally to beat the worst. Phoenix (23-5) outscored Dallas (2-25) by 29-18 in the fourth quarter to avoid an embarrassing loss. \"It was tough to get up for a game like this,\" said Charles Barkley, who led the Suns with 32 points and 14 rebounds.
