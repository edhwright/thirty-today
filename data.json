There may be an inch of hope on the horizon in the new twin-jet Boeing 777, but don't hold your breath: The 777 will not make a commercial debut until next summer, and it is a protean plane, one with an interior that can be rearranged quickly, so what you see on the charts may not be what you get.    Seating in the main cabins of major United States airlines continues to get tighter as competition intensifies. As John McDonald, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines said, schedule and price are the bottom line for air travelers, and extra space will attract new customers only when bottom lines are equal. \"The market won't support it,\" Mr. McDonald said. \"Comfort is one thing everyone talks about, but you still see 300 people crowded aboard a charter 727 to San Juan.\" This would be more than twice the capacity on a scheduled flight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"HORSE RACING: JUVENILE AND JUVENILE FILLIES;\nFlanders Wins but Fractures Right Foreleg","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/sports/horse-racing-juvenile-and-juvenile-fillies-flanders-wins-but.html","abstract":"The winner's circle after today's $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs was crowded with the victorious owner, the trainer and jockey, and a gathering of hangers-on that would make a prizefighter blush.\n\nBut the conspicuous absence of a horse left everyone with a forced, tight smile, as the connections of the 2-year-old filly Flanders clashed with the emotional high of winning, then seeing the filly taken away in a horse ambulance with what turned out to be fractures in her right foreleg.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Beth Estreicher, Lawrence Farkas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/style/weddings-beth-estreicher-lawrence-farkas.html","abstract":"  Beth Elane Estreicher, a daughter of Sandy and Albert Estreicher of Willowbrook, S.I., was married last evening to Lawrence William Farkas, a son of Sylvia and Sidney Farkas of Forest Hills, Queens.

It became such an important conduit of goods and people that trains running twice daily between Kenya and Uganda were full with passengers, who included in the early years Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. Churchill called Uganda the \"Pearl of Africa,\" a sobriquet that stuck.   But in the early 1970's Idi Amin put his chokehold on Uganda, and the East African community, which had created common currency and markets among Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, rancorously disintegrated.

At times, however, Mr. Lautenberg portrays himself as an inside outsider, saying that he would be able to do more for New Jersey as a third-term Senator than Mr. Haytaian would as a novice in Washington. ANALYSIS    Though polls throughout the campaign have shown Mr. Lautenberg with a comfortable lead, the New Jersey electorate is notorious for last-minute volatility and there is still a large bloc of undecided voters.   Mr. Lautenberg needs a good turnout from the traditionally Democratic urban areas. A year ago, Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, lost to Christine Todd Whitman by about 25,000 votes out of 2.5 million votes cast, largely because he did poorly and she did surprisingly well on that kind of turf. For Mr. Haytaian to win, he must rally his bedrock of conservative voters and the rest of the Republican faithful, but as importantly, he must match Mrs. Whitman's performance in urban areas, particularly among black voters.  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES    FRANK A. LOBIONDO, 48. Republican from Vineland, a State Assemblyman who works as the operations manager for his family's trucking business. A former member of the Cumberland County Board of Freeholders, first elected to the State Assembly in 1987.  Has earned a reputation as its most conservative member. Sponsored law making \"stalking\" a crime. Lost 1992 race for Congress against the Democratic incumbent, William J. Hughes.   LOUIS N. MAGAZZU, 37, Democrat from Vineland. A lawyer, currently the solicitor for the city of Vineland; has never held elected office. THE DISTRICT    Before 1974, the Second could be counted on to vote Republican. But Mr. Hughes rode to victory that year on the Watergate wave that swept dozens of Democrats into office. In spite of his party label, his conservative politics and his support of environmental protection, anti-crime legislation and senior-citizen issues helped him hold on to that office for 20 years before he decided earlier this year to retire. It is expected that with the popular Mr. Hughes now off the political scene, the district will return a Republican to office. THE ISSUES    Mr. LoBiondo has campaigned unwaveringly on conservative beliefs: lower taxes, spending cuts and reduction of the Federal Government. Mr. Magazzu has stressed fighting crime as the main theme of his campaign, including championing gun control laws. ANALYSIS    In land mass, southern New Jersey's sprawling Second District -- which encompasses all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, is the largest in the state. In politics, it is bedrock Republican and conservative. In 1992, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats 85,000 to 70,000 with about 150,000 unaffiliated voters. If Mr. LoBiondo loses, it will rank as a major Election Day upset. The Republican candidate has raised more money than his opponent by a 3-to-1 margin and polls show him with at least a 30-point lead.   The race has significance beyond even the impressive boundaries of the Second. Under the redistricting that reduced the New Jersey Congressional delegation to 13, Mr. Hughes's lock on the Second District gave Democrats a 7-to-6 majority. The majority will assuredly shift to the Republicans on Nov. 8. In practice, it will give the Republicans little more than political bragging rights, but it will be another blow to the political psyche of New Jersey's Democrats, who in the last four years have also lost control of both chambers of the Legislature and the Governor's mansion. EIGHTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES    HERB KLEIN, 64, a Democrat and a lawyer from Clifton. Served in the State Assembly for four years in the 1970's. Won Congressional seat two years ago in an expensive and bitter race. A prominent Democratic fund-raiser between his two stints in elected office, Mr. Klein spent more than $500,000 of his own money and $1.2 million overall in his victory two years ago.   BILL MARTINI, 47, a Republican and a lawyer from Clifton. Served on Clifton City Council and is a Passaic County Freeholder; also a former Assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey. THE DISTRICT    The Eighth was redesigned two years ago after New Jersey lost one of its 14 Congressional seats as a result of the 1990 Census. When Representative Robert A. Roe, a 12-term Democrat, saw the new district lines, he decided to retire. The district, once a haven for Democrats, is now highly competitive. It includes the blue-collar urban centers of Paterson and Passaic, as well as suburban towns like Glen Ridge, Cedar Grove and Verona. THE ISSUES    Both candidates say fear of crime is the chief concern of voters, with the economy, taxes and government spending also high on the list. Mr. Klein points to the recently enacted Federal crime bill as the first initiative coming out of Washington in years that offers real hope of increasing public safety. Mr. Martini calls the bill \"pork laden,\" with programs that have little to do with crime-fighting. He has said that only the certainty of prison sentences will reduce violent crime. Mr. Klein said he voted against the Clinton budget because it did not have enough spending cuts, and has consistently opposed tax increases that affect the middle class. Mr. Martini charges that his opponent later voted for all the spending proposals in the budget he opposed and that he repeatedly passed up opportunities to vote for further deficit reductions. ANALYSIS    Leaders in both parties agree that this is the closest Congressional race in the state this year. Both sides have spent heavily on campaign advertising and have been supported by visits from party luminaries from outside the state.

But in the final days of the gubernatorial campaign, State Senator George E.

Mrs. Campbell, a retired school teacher from Denville, N.J., wore a headlamp so she could see the eggs as they fell into her hands.\n\n \"They were warm and sticky,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"And they dropped out of this one-and-a-half-yard-long leatherback turtle three or four at a time. I handed them to a volunteer, and she put them into a plastic bag. Mama turtle had dug her nest in a stretch of sand likely to be washed away, so we moved all the eggs to a safe zone on the beach. It was a grand opportunity -- totally satisfying.\"\n\n Mrs. Campbell was a volunteer on an expedition in St. Croix, the Virgin Islands, sponsored by Earth-watch, an environmental organization that signs up volunteers who pay to work with scientists on research projects in 60 countries.\n\n Every year tens of thousands of Americans like Mrs. Campbell spend their vacations abroad on educational trips sponsored by museums, universities, religious and political groups and other organizations that offer specialized learning. Many participants are teachers, who convert their summer learning into a course for students.\n\n \"For many adults, study abroad is a dream post-poned,\" said Joan Elias Gore of the Council on International Educational Exchange in New York. \"They want to enter a culture in a way that lets them learn it and live it, rather than see it as tourists.\"\n\n An art trip led by a museum curator or a safari escorted by a wildlife researcher often seems the ticket to adults seeking a learning vacation.\n\n \"They take their education seriously and they want to know that their time won't be wasted,\" said Edith Gaines, who started a travel-study program at the Art Institute of Chicago 11 years ago. In 1995, the Art Institute will offer 15 international trips.\n\n Some adult learners are empty-nesters, whose children have grown and moved away from home. \"These adults want to understand the meaning and variety of life,\" said Lynne Kaufman, director of travel-study programs at the University of California Berkeley Extension. \"When they discuss 'King Lear,' they know what it's like to have an ungrateful child.\"\n\n Mrs. Kaufman supervises summer programs in England at Oxford University, where small seminars are taught by British dons. A list of required reading is sent to participants before courses begin.\n\n Pat Fairbanks, 62, and her husband, Bob, 65, of Monarch Beach, Calif., attended the Oxford program last summer. \"You're there, you forget all about O.J. Simpson,\" said Mrs. Fairbanks, a former real estate broker. \"We really enjoyed the stimulation of studying with people all ages -- 19 to 80.\"\n\n They also studied \"Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Painting\" in Nice and Paris through Elderhostel. In 1994, 27,000 people 60 and older traveled in Elderhostel's academic programs in 49 countries. Elderhostel does not assign homework or required reading, and the Fairbankses found that a drawback. \"It's just not as demanding,\" Mr. Fairbanks said.\n\n\"Still, our Elderhostel trip was fascinating,\" Mrs. Fairbanks said. \"The instructors were outstanding. But we were probably the youngest people, and we missed the multi-generational aspect.\"\n\n For Marjorie Kramer, 77, of Morristown, N.J., an Elderhostel program of archeological study in Turkey was a good fit. \"We heard lectures and we visited fortifications, palaces and excavations,\" said Mrs. Kramer, a former fashion coordinator at Neiman Marcus. \"Elderhostel has a marvelous grasp on what's best seen firsthand and what's best described in lectures.\"\n\n An otherwise excellent trip can sometimes fall short at dinnertime, though. Mrs. Fairbanks said the food in her Nice hotel \"was so bad, the elders got hostile and complained, so the tour organizer moved our dinners to another hotel.\"\n\n Lodging, to, can pose a challenge, according to Mrs. Gore of the Council on International Educational Exchange. \"Someone who owns his own home might wind up in a student dormitory, sharing a room. Students love music -- often late at night -- but it may not be the music you love.\" \n\nEducational exchange is a popular component of adult travel. Marie-France Cambronne, 36, an assistant professor of education at the State University of New York in Cortland, traveled on an American Field Service trip to rural Thailand, where she designed workshops to help high school instructors teach English.\n\n\"When I came to New York from Haiti as a teen-ager, I spoke no English, so I know what it is to learn a new language,\" said Miss Cambronne.  Her five-week trip cost $3,000, and included airfare, lodging and meals.\n\nA cheaper program is International Volunteer Projects, offered by the Council on International Educational Exchange.  Participants spend two to four weeks working on environmental or community service projects, such as helping to restore a 12th-century monastery. The price is $165 plus airfare, and includes lodging and meals. Accommodations are far from fancy, however -- sometimes a bunk in a school.\n\nThe Stanford University Alumni Association's 17-day Northwest Passage Expedition was in a different category altogether. The September cruise, on a Russian icebreaker, cut its way into waters north of the Arctic Circle. Depending on the cabin travelers chose, the price was between $10,980 and $20,000, plus $1,900 for airfare from the East Coast. All meals were included, though.\n\nTO GET the most out of a study tour, a traveler should insist on two criteria, according to Ed Williams, director of TraveLearn, a Lakeville, Pa., organization that arranges travel-study for 266 universities, colleges and community colleges in the United States.\n\n\"First, be sure the tour is led by a guide and a faculty escort who have expert knowledge about the country you're visiting and the discipline you're studying,\" said Mr. Williams, an assistant professor at Kean College in Union, N.J. \"Second, look for a small travel group. Our philosophy is never to send more than 20 people, and we average 14. Think of it this way. This should be a luxury field trip with the best teachers you've ever had.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"The Museums of Mom and Dad","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/books/the-museums-of-mom-and-dad.html","abstract":"  FAMILY By Ian Frazier.

Whether it's the turf wars depicted in gangster rap or the suffocating tension heard in urban metal bands, cities are grim, soul-depleting battlefields; earplugs and bulletproof vests are as vital to survival as a Walkman.   Pop musicians are often right, of course; city life can be a wearying, disconcerting grind. But just as often a city's mix of styles and sounds -- and the joyful mess that results when they clash -- can be as invigorating as a sudden breeze on a hot day, which is where the all-female quartet Luscious Jackson comes in. The cover of the band's first album, \"Natural Ingredients\" (Grand Royal/Capitol CDP 7243-8-28356; all three formats), is crammed with graffiti -- in particular, the fat-lettered Day-Glo style that sprang up during the early day of hip-hop.

Mrs. Campbell, a retired school teacher from Denville, N.J., wore a headlamp so she could see the eggs as they fell into her hands.\n\n \"They were warm and sticky,\" said Mrs. Campbell. \"And they dropped out of this one-and-a-half-yard-long leatherback turtle three or four at a time. I handed them to a volunteer, and she put them into a plastic bag. Mama turtle had dug her nest in a stretch of sand likely to be washed away, so we moved all the eggs to a safe zone on the beach. It was a grand opportunity -- totally satisfying.\"\n\n Mrs. Campbell was a volunteer on an expedition in St. Croix, the Virgin Islands, sponsored by Earth-watch, an environmental organization that signs up volunteers who pay to work with scientists on research projects in 60 countries.\n\n Every year tens of thousands of Americans like Mrs. Campbell spend their vacations abroad on educational trips sponsored by museums, universities, religious and political groups and other organizations that offer specialized learning. Many participants are teachers, who convert their summer learning into a course for students.\n\n \"For many adults, study abroad is a dream post-poned,\" said Joan Elias Gore of the Council on International Educational Exchange in New York. \"They want to enter a culture in a way that lets them learn it and live it, rather than see it as tourists.\"\n\n An art trip led by a museum curator or a safari escorted by a wildlife researcher often seems the ticket to adults seeking a learning vacation.\n\n \"They take their education seriously and they want to know that their time won't be wasted,\" said Edith Gaines, who started a travel-study program at the Art Institute of Chicago 11 years ago. In 1995, the Art Institute will offer 15 international trips.\n\n Some adult learners are empty-nesters, whose children have grown and moved away from home. \"These adults want to understand the meaning and variety of life,\" said Lynne Kaufman, director of travel-study programs at the University of California Berkeley Extension. \"When they discuss 'King Lear,' they know what it's like to have an ungrateful child.\"\n\n Mrs. Kaufman supervises summer programs in England at Oxford University, where small seminars are taught by British dons. A list of required reading is sent to participants before courses begin.\n\n Pat Fairbanks, 62, and her husband, Bob, 65, of Monarch Beach, Calif., attended the Oxford program last summer. \"You're there, you forget all about O.J. Simpson,\" said Mrs. Fairbanks, a former real estate broker. \"We really enjoyed the stimulation of studying with people all ages -- 19 to 80.\"\n\n They also studied \"Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Painting\" in Nice and Paris through Elderhostel. In 1994, 27,000 people 60 and older traveled in Elderhostel's academic programs in 49 countries. Elderhostel does not assign homework or required reading, and the Fairbankses found that a drawback. \"It's just not as demanding,\" Mr. Fairbanks said.\n\n\"Still, our Elderhostel trip was fascinating,\" Mrs. Fairbanks said. \"The instructors were outstanding. But we were probably the youngest people, and we missed the multi-generational aspect.\"\n\n For Marjorie Kramer, 77, of Morristown, N.J., an Elderhostel program of archeological study in Turkey was a good fit. \"We heard lectures and we visited fortifications, palaces and excavations,\" said Mrs. Kramer, a former fashion coordinator at Neiman Marcus. \"Elderhostel has a marvelous grasp on what's best seen firsthand and what's best described in lectures.\"\n\n An otherwise excellent trip can sometimes fall short at dinnertime, though. Mrs. Fairbanks said the food in her Nice hotel \"was so bad, the elders got hostile and complained, so the tour organizer moved our dinners to another hotel.\"\n\n Lodging, to, can pose a challenge, according to Mrs. Gore of the Council on International Educational Exchange. \"Someone who owns his own home might wind up in a student dormitory, sharing a room. Students love music -- often late at night -- but it may not be the music you love.\" \n\nEducational exchange is a popular component of adult travel. Marie-France Cambronne, 36, an assistant professor of education at the State University of New York in Cortland, traveled on an American Field Service trip to rural Thailand, where she designed workshops to help high school instructors teach English.\n\n\"When I came to New York from Haiti as a teen-ager, I spoke no English, so I know what it is to learn a new language,\" said Miss Cambronne.  Her five-week trip cost $3,000, and included airfare, lodging and meals.\n\nA cheaper program is International Volunteer Projects, offered by the Council on International Educational Exchange.  Participants spend two to four weeks working on environmental or community service projects, such as helping to restore a 12th-century monastery. The price is $165 plus airfare, and includes lodging and meals. Accommodations are far from fancy, however -- sometimes a bunk in a school.\n\nThe Stanford University Alumni Association's 17-day Northwest Passage Expedition was in a different category altogether. The September cruise, on a Russian icebreaker, cut its way into waters north of the Arctic Circle. Depending on the cabin travelers chose, the price was between $10,980 and $20,000, plus $1,900 for airfare from the East Coast. All meals were included, though.\n\nTO GET the most out of a study tour, a traveler should insist on two criteria, according to Ed Williams, director of TraveLearn, a Lakeville, Pa., organization that arranges travel-study for 266 universities, colleges and community colleges in the United States.\n\n\"First, be sure the tour is led by a guide and a faculty escort who have expert knowledge about the country you're visiting and the discipline you're studying,\" said Mr. Williams, an assistant professor at Kean College in Union, N.J. \"Second, look for a small travel group. Our philosophy is never to send more than 20 people, and we average 14. Think of it this way. This should be a luxury field trip with the best teachers you've ever had.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"SOAPBOX;\nGay and Black: A High-Wire Act","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/soapbox-gay-and-black-a-highwire-act.html","abstract":"MY life usually feels like I'm balancing on a thin wire strung across the city.

Today, a growing number of American educators believe that the world is too small, too competititve and too dangerous to tolerate the sort of ignorant chauvinism that so provoked James. The cure, they say, is not small, easy or cheap: American higher education needs to go global.    That does not mean lightheartedly dispatching students to sample cultural bonbons in exotic lands. To serious-minded American educators, globalization means such things as the presence of large numbers of foreign students and professors on campuses in the United States, so that this fall at New York University's Washington Square campus, for example, more than 30 different languages are being spoken.    It means tens, ultimately hundrends of thousands of American students resident in foreign countries, mastering the local language and culture and -- as with present-day University of California students -- taking a full load of rigorous, faculty-screened courses taught in the native tongue at one of 100 institutions in 32 different countries.    It means internationalizing the curriculum, as in a course in accounting at the University of Michigan School of Business that now includes the study of Japanese regulations permitting the depreciation of assets at many times the rate allowed in the United States.    It means using the latest technology so that sudents at Ramapo College, a small, publicly supported institution in Mahwah, N.J., join in discussions with other students, scholars, artists and officials around the world in 120 teleconferences every year.    \"International education is not a new idea, but the times have now conjoined to make it dominant,\" said L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who has taken a leading role in the movement.    \"What's happening here,\" he continued, \"is comparable to what happened in the 19th century when Johns Hopkins University adopted the philosophy of the great German research universities and set the pattern for Harvard, Yale and the others.\"    The number of American student studying abroad has grown steadily over the last five years and is now at a record high of 72,000, according to the Institute of International Education, the nation's leading educational exchange organization. This figure is small in comparison with the number of foreign students studying in the United States (438,000, or six times as many), but -- significantly -- the profile of these itinerant American students has changed.    \"Typically, they used to be affluent women in their junior year at one of the elite Seven Sisters colleges and they would be studying architecture and French language in Paris,\" said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute. \"But today more of them tend to be male, they are less likely to be affluent, they may be interested in business or industry and there's a slight shift away from Europe as their destination.\"    One conspicuous sign of the growth of international studies is the number of study-abroad programs now being offered. Ranging from a business and economics course at the university of Hungary in Pecs to another concentrating on language and culture at the leading university in Hanoi, Vietnam, these programs have virtually doubled over the last decade, from 1,857 to 3,701.    Students are eagerly responding. At an elite institution like Harvard University, 51 percent of the undergraduates participate in at least one work or study program abroad. At Kalamazoo College, a small, selective liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Mich., 85 percent of the students study overseas thanks to a private gift of more than $5 million that subsidizes travel and on-site living expenses.    A few American colleges and universities have not been satisfied with merely offering study-abroad programs but have adopted globalism as a fundamental objective for the entire institution. Speaking for N.Y.U., Mr. Oliva recently declared: \"We plan to enter the next century as the quintessential global university. We will extend to every undergraduate the opportunity to study abroad as part of his or her N.Y.U. education, and we will become a center for global faculty inquiry and a center for worldwide conferences of university leaders.\"    Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said his institution aspired to be \"a global college\" for more practical reasons. \"We believe,\" he said, \"that our graduates likely will either supervise or be supervised by someone of another race, ethnicity or nationality, and that their careers and lives as citizens will be affected by international and intercultural life.\"    Several American colleges and universities have established campuses in foreign countries so that students may spend extended periods abroad and earn credits readily accepted by employers and graduate schools in the United States. Webster University in St. Louis operates wholly owned branches in Geneva, London, Vienna and the Dutch city of Leiden.    Emerson College, a small liberal arts school in Boston, has established a branch in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where students study subjects such as global marketing, communications and advertising.    Some of these branches fare better than others; Japan, for example, has proved especially tricky for American institutions to penetrate. Of the more than 20 American branches established in Japan in recent years, at least 9 have failed, most recently a Texas A & M branch in Koriyama. All are said to have been victims of the economic recession in Japan and the unexpected difficulty of recruiting Japanese students.    But if it has not always been easy to attract foreign students to American compuses overseas, foreign students have for years flocked to attend colleges and universities in the United States. In fact, according to the Department of Commerce, the 438,000 foreign students currently resident in the United States, while only a small fraction of the total enrollment of 14.5 million, have fed a major and all-but-hidden export industry bringing some $6 billion annual to the American economy.    The cohort of foreign students has kept growing steadily at the rate of about 4.5 percent a year for the past two decades. Quite often, these students become leaders in their societies at home. Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said he recently attended a state reception in Seoul, South Korea, at which no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers introduced themselves to him as Berkeley graduates.    \"That's typical,\" Chancellor Tien remarked. \"I get the same greetings in Indonesia and Singapore.\"    The reasons for all of this activity are many. The first and most important is the rise of the global economy. Alert, job-oriented students have come to realize that as the world shrinks, many of the best jobs are going to go to college graduates who possess international skills. For example, after graduating from Wellesley College in 1987, Cynthia Jeffers taught English for two years in Japan under a program run by the Ministry of Education. She then returned to the United States, entered the Harvard Business School and upon her graduation last June landed a job as an associate in the corporate finance department of Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the major brokerage firms on Wall Street. Her experience in Japan, she said, greatly increased her prospects in the job market.   Another stimulus for globalization is that most financial aid for students has recently become \"portable,\" as college officials like to say. In the past, vaguely worded Federal statutes authorizing financial aid for college students -- Pell grants, Stafford loans and the like -- made many student advisers hesitant to recommend the use of these grants overseas.   Stephen Cooper, the director of academic programs abroad at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that he and a group of associates successfully lobbied Congress to make every form of Federal aid for students applicable for study overseas. The new explicit language appears in the Higher Education Act of 1992.   \"Judging from the number of inquiries I've received from around the country, this is having a big impact,\" said Professor Cooper.   Still another spur is the development and prevalence of new communications technology that allows educators to leap oceans and cross borders with impunity. B. Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School and a pioneer in the field educators now call \"distance learning,\" has taken the new technology a step further. Last year Dean White set up a program sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the national airline of Hong Kong, that employs interactive television to link M.B.A. candidates in Hong Kong with professors at Ann Arbor.   \"It's actually a complex teaching system because we don't believe we can provide the quality we want with interactive TV alone,\" said Dean White. \"Consequently, we send our faculty to Hong Kong and bring their students here for face-to-face meetings.\"   \"It's the future,\" he continued. \"Our pilot project for Cathay Pacific carries with it a vast productivity potential.\"   Another reason for the growth of interest in globalization is that travel abroad, like hit shows on Broadway, has good word of mouth. \"It's a cliche, but over and over you hear students saying 'It changed my life!' \" said Dr. Krasno.   It is a point confirmed by Corbin Smith, the director of Stanford University's Overseas Study Office. \"When we surveyed the senior class here over the last few years,\" Mr. Smith said, \"asking what was the most meaningful experience during their undergraduate years, more than 87 percent of those who participated in a Stanford study-abroad program gave that the highest rating.\"   Not everyone is so enthusiastic. Roger Kimball, the neoconservative author of \"Tenured Radicals,\" which takes a skeptical look at academia, observes that colleges are \"making out like bandits\" by collecting full tuition from students and \"placing them at a fraction of that cost at overseas institutions.\"   It is true that the ranks of foreign students in the United States have been swollen not only by the quality of colleges here but also by sharp-eyed admissions officials who have successfully recruited well-heeled foreign students when they were unable to fill their campuses with enough American students able to pay the ever-rising tuition costs.   In fact, unregulated overseas recruitment proved so easy -- and profitable -- that a few years ago unscrupulous hucksters began to recruit foreign students for small community colleges in the United States with misleading promises that after a year or two the student could transfer into Harvard or M.I.T. Today, some professional organizations have adopted generally effective guidelines and codes of ethics to substantially reduce such misrepresentations.   And some critics, like Mr. Kimball, say there is a great   Continued on Page 31  Continued from Page 26  deal of wishful thinking in the notion that \"a semester abroad is going to make one into an internationalist.\"   Holly M. Carter, dean of the office of educational opportunity programs at Northeastern University, argues that the belief that today's college students are more culturally aware than their predecessors is a comforting myth that ignores \"the increase in hate crimes, blatant bigotry and racism on the campuses.\"   But educational leaders like Mr. Oliva of N.Y.U. argue that a global perspective is vital to the international community. \"There are at least three factors driving the globalization of education today,\" he said. \"The first is purely serendipitous: We're on the cusp of a new wave of immigration.\" (About a million immigrants have come to New York over the past decade, many of whom have attended N.Y.U.)   \"Second,\" he continued, \"people realize that the more different environments you move into, the more you learn. Conversely, the more you study with people just like yourself, the less you learn.    \"I realize in my own life that I never learned more than when I was overseas for a year and a half. Everything became very vivid. There was no moment when I could let my mind relax. And gradually, I discovered that I could master change.\"   \"And third,\" Mr. Oliva said, \"the demise of the Soviet Union has made Americans more international than ever. It made us realize that the Soviet Union had been a major force in policing ethnic rivalries. The world got capped under big cloaks. We used to think of the division between Northern and Southern Ireland, and what's happening in Yemen, as anomalies. Now we see them as the rule.    \"In the future,\" he continued, \"we probably face 30 to 40 years of instability and border wars like the 19th century, but with one frightening difference -- small nations possessing immensely destructive weapons. So our job in international education is to help provide a global environment in which these ethnic disputes can be handled on the basis of intellectual discourse and debate, not war.\"   John Markham, director of the University of California's Education Abroad Program, says, \"The question I like to ask is: Should the University of California have a foreign policy?\"   Most educators acknowledge that the vast majority of American faculty and students are still relatively insular, but they are optimistic that economic forces will prevail.   \"The sea change will occur,\" Dr. Krasno said, \"when the global economy drives corporate leaders to say they want to hire people with foreign language skills and knowledge of foreign cultures, and that all things being equal they will hire them first. That's when the rush will begin.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Gerry H. Rubin, David L.

While travelers stream to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, few make the trip there. Indeed, most Westerners know it only vaguely as a country somewhere in the Balkans, perhaps as the fairy-tale setting for George Bernard Shaw's \"Arms and the Man,\" or for its music -- above all, the otherworldly folk singing of the a cappella female chorus called Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares.\n\nSome people may even confuse Bulgaria with Romania, its trouble-plagued neighbor to the north.

One of the most significant of these outbreaks was the appearance in the late 1940's and 1950's -- overnight, like so many mushrooms -- of countless small independent record companies based in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and other urban centers.    Fed and watered by the huge numbers of blacks who had swarmed to the cities for defense jobs during World War II, the indies, as they were called, pumped out dance music, hot blues and boogie-woogie records that the major labels usually just didn't bother with. These small companies were often started by music-industry amateurs -- small businessmen, nightclub owners and hustlers, some of whom actually had a genuine ear for music, all of whom had an eye for the main chance.  Spurred by an amalgam of opportunism, megalomania, true love for music and sheer greed, they managed to document some of the most vigorous popular music ever recorded in America. In the process, they called the tune that the entire industry eventually danced to.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Lara A. Hopfl, L. I.

And T.W.A. also deserves an aerial loop-the-loop. While the airline contested the designation of parts of Eero Saarinen's 1962 building, described by Robert A. M. Stern as the \"Grand Central of the jet age,\" it had good reason for doing so. In addition to sharing J.F.K.'s general state of dilapidation, the T.W.A. terminal is in dire need of design modifications. Airport security regulations and increased air traffic have placed demands on the building unforeseen 30 years ago. Happily, these changes will now be supervised by a preservation architect sensitive to Saarinen's design.   The Grand Central comparison is probably stretching it. While T.W.A. is a powerful piece of expressionistic sculpture, echoing Erich Mendelssohn's dynamic designs of the 1920's, it lacks Grand Central's urban prominence and complexity. Wallace K. Harrison's main terminal for La Guardia remains the most architecturally distinguished airport building in New York, not least because of the skill with which Harrison knitted the terminal into the context of urban transportation. With its raised roof canopy tilted toward the sky above the terminal's concave facade, the design deftly merges the highway's horizontal curve with an airplane's upward angle of takeoff.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Ghostly Spot, New Life . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-morrisania-ghostly-spot-new-life.html","abstract":"  When Pearl Fleming moved to Walton Avenue more than two decades ago, she would see the bustle around the Morrisania Hospital's emergency-room entrance and the students in the adjoining nursing school.

There is little indication that you are approaching what is billed as France's most picturesque village.\n\nBut after turning off the highway at Meximieux, the road begins to climb, and the buildings become scarcer. The countryside lifts into gently rolling hills, with clumps of trees nestling in their curves. In the distance, atop a flat-topped, buttelike hill, you can see a stone wall, interrupted by a vast portal and crowned by a huge church tower and a jumble of terra-cotta tile roofs. You could be in central Italy rather than on the other side of the Alps.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Lopez, Osborne, Ali: Ah, What a Banquet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-lopez-osborne-ali-ah-what-a-banquet.html","abstract":"  Felipe Lopez of St. John's flew out of town on a school night (\"He needs another award?\" groused his old high school teacher. \"He should be home with his books.\") Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne flew out of town on a practice night (he stayed only 20 minutes before he flew home).

It has become a posthumous tribute to the American artist rather than a follow-up to the gallery's Dehner exhibition of 1993. The show opens today and will continue through Dec. 4.   Influenced heavily by the Fauves, Cubists and German Expressionists of the 1920's, Dehner drew and painted until the 1950's, when she began to sculpture as well. The show contains line drawings, watercolors, gouaches and bronzes, varying in scale and ranging in style from the figurative to the abstract.   During the 50's she divorced her husband, the sculptor David Smith, and began achieving a reputation for herself. The gallery director, Vincent Baldassano, said: \"Dehner is often analyzed in terms of her 25-year marriage to Smith, during which she nurtured him intellectually and artistically. His effect on her life and art, however, is variously described as competitive, intimidating and stifling.\"   The gallery, at 43 Katonah Avenue, is open Thursdays through Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. For more information, call 232-7529. FIBER FAIR    Fiber artists will be on hand in profusion and would-be spinners, weavers, knitters and crocheters should be intrigued with the possibilities displayed on Saturday when the Westchester Knitting Guild, the Handweavers Guild of Westchester and the Center for Fiber Arts at Marymount College get together for a Fiber Fair on the Tarrytown campus from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.   The sponsoring nonprofit groups are dedicated to promoting the use of fleece, cotton, wool, silk and flax in creative ways, and they encourage people to use natural fibers in weaving. Visitors who come dressed in their own fibre creations will receive gifts, and those who donate a knitted or woven cap to a drive called Caps for Kids will get a free raffle ticket.   Throughout the day there will be classes for beginners and experienced practitioners, children, teenagers and adults, in knitting, spinning, weaving, dyeing, crocheting, pattern charting and machine knitting. Yarn, fleece, flax, silk, buttons, books, videos and all kinds of knitting, spinning and weaving equipment will be on sale.   The college cafeteria will be open for lunch, and all events will be held in Rita Hall, including the raffle, a bake sale and a fiber fashion show.  Admission will be $5, $2 for children. The college is at 100 Marymount Avenue. Call 322-1627 for more information.

But a stand of 20 healthy American chestnut trees was identified in 1991 at the Lasdon Arboretum in Somers, and the site has become a research center for the American Chestnut Foundation of Morgantown, W.V.   Dr. Sandra Anagnostakis, a biologist affiliated with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, has developed a disease-resistant American chestnut tree. She will preside over a program about her work and the work of the Morgantown foundation and the Lasdon Arboretum in bringing a disease-resistant chestnut tree to market by the year 2000. The event is on Wednesday at 7 P.M. at the Arboretum, and admission is free.   To reach the Arboretum, in Lasdon Park, take Exit 6 off I-684 and go west on Route 35 four miles to the entrance.

Valour! Compassion!,\" would reply, \"Who says so?\" It's probable that Buzz, who's convinced that virtually everybody is gay and just doesn't admit it, could make a case for Chekhov. Yet it isn't homosexuality that links the new comedy to \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"The Seagull.\" Rather, it's Mr. McNally's breadth of vision and his ambitious attempt to deal with characters, who are both privileged and threatened, in a way that ignores self-pity but doesn't ignore the larger world outside. Though the audience never sees that other world, what's happening in it is very much a part of the life of the play itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"The Barnstorming of New York Candidates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/the-barnstorming-of-new-york-candidates.html","abstract":"  From the Brooklyn waterfront to Brookhaven, L.I., to a rally in Rochester, the man who wants a fourth term as Governor and the men who would succeed him sped into the last weekend of an election campaign that will test the power of anti-incumbent anger and perhaps reshape New York politics.

In countries where graduates find they have trained for careers in fields already crowded with professionals, many schools are shifting their emphasis to job training and workplace skills. Some universities find themselves short of students; others have a surplus. As institutions of higher learning struggle to find solutions, they are questioning long-held traditions and beliefs about their systems of higher education.    If French students were long thought to spend their time sitting around drinking coffee, smoking Gitanes and discussing philosophy, that image vanished in clouds of tear gas this spring when tens of thousands of them took to the streets to insist on their right to a well-paid job after they completed their studies.    The spark for the violent protests was a new law allowing employers to pay less than the legal minimum wage to those with technical diplomas. Affected students were outraged. They said they had been led to higher education by the promise of good jobs, but now were being told that their studies were worthless.    The Government quickly backed off, saying it had merely tried to fight unemployment, which affects one in four French youths between the ages of 18 and 25. But the dispute helped focus on a more fundamental issue. What is the purpose of higher education in France today? Should youths be educated for the sake of being educated or should the emphasis be on preparing them for the workplace?    Traditionally, French universities had a somewhat elitist approach. But since 1984 everyone who passes the baccalaureat examination at the end of high school has the right to a place at a university. As a result, the number of students in higher education has jumped from 1.2 million in 1980 to 2 million this year.    Over this period, umemployment has continued to rise. And since by law university students can study what they like, they are rarely guided toward degrees with better job prospects. It is only when they complete their studies, then, that many discover they have not been prepared for the job market.    Officials in the Ministry of Higher Education conceded that they were under pressure from university rectors to limit the number of students and even to institute entry exams, and under pressure from the private sector to focus more on practical education. But they said all efforts to bring change are politically explosive, not only because higher education is now considered a right, but also because universities absorb youths who might otherwise be unemployed.    \"It's a critical situation,\" one ministry official said. \"The student needs to know if he's capable of doing a specific job, but the university doesn't answer that question. It's only posed when the graduate looks for a job and is told, 'You've done three years of law studies, but tens of thousands have done the same thing, so why should we choose you?' People are only now discovering that their blind faith in degrees is a fiction.\"    As a result, more students are now opting for two-year courses in so-called University Institutes of Technology because graduates from these schools are in greater demand than those from a conventional university. It is not surprising, then, that they fought the wage cut. Some experts believe students must change as much as universities. \"No one wants to stop studying before university,\" said Jean Barrans, a retired professor from Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse. \"Everyone wants a white-collar job and no longer accepts a blue-collar job.\" Professor Barrans also said that he felt French students had grown passive because only 20 percent work their way through the university. The rest are supported by their parents or government grants. \"If they had to work to finance their studies, as in the United States,\" he said, \"perhaps things would be better here.\" ALAN RIDING","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"BEST SELLERS: November 6, 1994","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/books/best-sellers-november-6-1994.html","abstract":"                   Weeks    This   Last   On    Week   Week   List   Fiction              1   1   3   INSOMNIA, by Stephen King.

CURRY JR., 42, Democrat. State Comptroller since 1990, lawyer, State Senator from 1979-83, ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1982, former political director of Freeze Voter, the political arm of the nuclear-freeze movement.    EUNICE S. GROARK, 56, A Connecticut Party. A one-time Republican, Lieutenant Governor since 1990 when she ran on the third-party ticket of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker. Lawyer, corporation counsel for Hartford from 1987-90, and a Hartford City Councilwoman from 1981-85.   JOHN G. ROWLAND, 37, Republican. Congressman from Waterbury from 1985-91, barely lost the 1990 race for governor, member of House Armed Services Committee. Consultant since 1990 for several military contractors based in Connecticut.    TOM SCOTT, 36, radio talk-show host, State Senator from 1981-1991, led anti-income tax movement in 1991, ran unsuccessfully for United States House of Representatives in 1990 and 1992. THE ISSUES    The state income tax, imposed in 1991, has been the central issue. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott promise to scrap it without raising other taxes. Mrs. Groark would not change the income tax, and Mr. Curry wants to keep it and economize elsewhere to provide money to cities and towns to cut property taxes. All candidates have called for expanded efforts to reduce crime, and all four favor the death penalty. Mrs. Groark has been attacked over the Weicker administration's policy of giving tax breaks and cash incentives to attract and retain companies, an approach she favors. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott says tax cuts would do more for the economy than such incentives. Mr. Curry would shift economic assistance to smaller companies. ANALYSIS    Mr. Rowland has been the front-runner since the campaign began, and has had a large advantage in financing, spending much of his money on television commercials. But Mr. Scott, who appeals to many of the same conservatives, has drawn off some support, and many voters, particularly women, have been troubled by Mr. Rowland's efforts to suppress a police report on a domestic dispute with his ex-wife in April. After a surprise primary victory, Mr. Curry has campaigned aggressively, but in a close race he may lose critical votes to Mrs. Groark. OTHER STATE RACES  (x denotes incumbents)   LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR M. Jodi Rell, Republican; Joseph P. Ganim, Democrat; Audrey Rowe, A Connecticut Party; Glen R. O'Keefe, independent   TREASURER Christopher Burnham, Republican; Joseph M. Suggs, Democrat (X)   COMPTROLLER Gene Gavin, Republican; Nancy Wyman, Democrat, A Connecticut Party   ATTORNEY GENERAL Richard Arnold, Republican; Richard Blumenthal, Democrat, A Connecticut Party (X)   SECRETARY OF THE STATE Andrea Scott, Republican; Miles S. Rapoport, Democrat, A Connecticut Party UNITED STATES SENATE  CANDIDATES    GERALD LABRIOLA, 62, Republican, retired pediatrician, State Senator from 1981-83, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1982 and for the Republican nomination for governor in 1982 and 1986.    JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, 52, Democrat, United States Senator since 1991; State Attorney General from 1983-89, State Senator from 1971-81. THE ISSUES    Mr. Lieberman's TV advertising depicts him as an advocate for creating jobs, fighting crime and making Congress more accountable. Dr. Labriola, relying largely on handshaking and yard signs, assails Mr. Lieberman for backing President Clinton's budget plan last year, calling it the largest tax increase in history. Dr. Labriola says Mr. Lieberman \"fakes right and votes left.\" ANALYSIS    Mr. Lieberman has had a commanding lead in the polls from the beginning and a huge advantage in fund raising, allowing him to air television commercials that focus on his family and his achievements and do not mention his opponent. Dr. Labriola has had little money for television ads. Some Democratic Party analysts have predicted the most lopsided victory in state history. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES    SAM GEJDENSON, 45, Democrat, dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House of Representatives, seeking his eighth term.    EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 53, Republican, a retired statistician at Pfizer. Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr. Gejdenson in 1992, a race he narrowly lost. THE DISTRICT    The Second Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut. It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism jobs have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard. THE ISSUES    Mr. Munster campaigned last time on the argument that Mr. Gejdenson had lost his local bearings after more than a decade in Congress. This time, the debate has centered more on effectiveness. Mr. Munster's commercials attack Mr. Gejdenson's attendance record for major votes. Mr. Gejdenson's commercials say Mr. Munster failed to do much of note as a State Senator. ANALYSIS    Mr. Gejdenson did not appear to take Mr. Munster seriously in 1992, but he is fighting hard this time, trading blow for blow in a negative campaign that seems to have shifted the advantage to Mr. Gejdenson. He has portrayed his Washington savvy as reaping huge benefits for the district in business for military contractors. FIFTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES    GARY A. FRANKS, 41, Republican, seeking his third term, the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in 60 years. Former labor-relations executive.    JAMES H. MALONEY, 46, Democrat, State Senator from Danbury since 1986. THE DISTRICT    The district is economically diverse, encompassing wealthy enclaves like Wilton and Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide. THE ISSUES    Mr. Maloney, with far less name recognition or money than his opponent, has tried to portray Mr. Franks as a Congressman more interested in gaining a national reputation than serving constituents. Mr. Franks has contended that Mr. Maloney has no real agenda to pursue if elected. ANALYSIS    Mr. Franks was considered vulnerable in 1992, when Bill Clinton carried Connecticut in the Presidential election, but he won with a 43 percent plurality when two Democrats -- one running as an independent -- split the Democratic vote. This year, he could benefit from having John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, on the ticket. Mr. Rowland represented the district from 1985 to 1991, and remains popular there.

IDENTITY: Makeup artist. AGE: 32. RECENT PROJECTS: Fashion Week spring shows for Isaac Mizrahi, Donna Karan, DKNY, Richard Tyler for Anne Klein, Ralph Lauren, Todd Oldham; author of \"The Art of Makeup,\" (HarperCollins, 1994; $60). PAST CLIENTS: Tina Turner, Barbra Streisand, Roseanne, Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Ross, Susan Sarandon, Uma Thurman, Audrey Hepburn, Anjelica Huston, and Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Allure magazines. Q. How did you get into makeup? A. As I was growing up in Louisiana, people told me I was ugly. I think it was because I was effeminate. Mine is the story of the ugly duckling, about being able to see that you're not what everyone around you is telling you that you are. I became interested in the idea of transformation.     Where it stemmed from, for me, was the awareness from a very early age that I was gay, then hearing how awful and evil that was. Eventually I realized that was all lies, and then I started questioning what else I had heard that wasn't true. It was a wonderful springboard for me into the world of fashion and beauty, because it kept me from accepting what was and made me see the possibilities of what could be. Q. It's interesting that you translated notions of illusion into such a literal metaphor. A. It wasn't anything conscious, but I guess it was vicarious, in a way -- the idea that if I can make you look good and feel good about yourself, that makes me feel good about myself because I helped you.  Q. What's this glamour thing about? A. At a certain point in the 80's, there was a no-makeup movement, which was, I think, a political movement. I always think everything that happens in the fashion world is based on politics. In the 80's, people in the fashion world were losing their friends to AIDS, they were watching gay and lesbian civil rights being destroyed, there was an enormous amount of sexism going on. And the fashion business reacted in several ways.     During the beginning of the Reagan years, there was a real white-male view of women as Barbie dolls -- very glamorous, and voluptuous. So in the early 80's there was a lot of Big. Big hair, big makeup, big breasts. Then, suddenly, came the no-makeup movement. What it meant politically was that women don't have to wear makeup to be accepted. It's O.K. for women to be bare-faced. And not only is it O.K., it's good, it's a great look. And it was important to expand the boundaries of what we considered acceptable.     Now, there's a return to glamour because even the no-makeup look was becoming oppressive. Q. So the fashion world presents us with an extreme? A. Always. No one's going to go home and do their makeup the way we do it for a magazine. But you can go off and say \"Oh, purple's the message.\" It's not about saying, \"Go wear this to go out tonight,\" but rather: \"Oh, yellow! Color! I'll put a little spring into it.\" Q. Who creates trends, and how? A. There's a really small group of people that can make a big difference. It's not like some little committee, and it keeps changing, but it's a group of people who love women and feel a great respect for women, and most of them have their finger on the pulse of what's going on, in terms of what affects their lives.     Manipulation is not part of the inspiration. It's the desire to open up doors and make things more acceptable.     That's where Kristin McMenamy and Kate Moss come in. That's where Roshumba comes in, or Naomi Campbell, who has more traditional black features than most of the black models before her. When Steven Meisel brings Kristin to the American public and says, \"This is beauty, and it's not the typical all-American blonde,\" it's because Steven fights for it that America wakes up. Like Barbra Streisand. Those are the people I love and adore, because they are breaking the boundaries and creating more acceptance for everyone. Q. What are some of the runway makeup trends that are new and interesting? A. I'll tell you what I think is the most old-fashioned: a ton of foundation. I think what's new is someone with dark, smoky eyes -- yet you can see their skin -- and glossy lips. Not so long ago, there was a return to the 70's, but it was done very literally, copied from a 70's magazine, without any modern take on it, which to me is uninspiring.     What I'm here for, as a makeup artist, is to present women with options. A new option is to be inspired by a look from the past, and then make it modern. Q. Who's doing the most innovative makeup nowadays? A. The Japanese are light-years ahead of everyone else when it comes to formulating makeup. It's scary to me that American companies have no clue, compared to the Japanese. For the Japanese it's more of an art. For American companies it's about how much something will sell. Q. What looks do you like? A. The whole range, from a woman who's completely dressed up, has her hair pulled back, let's say, and wears a velvet coat, huge earrings and no makeup, except for some sort of oil in her face (I love skin that looks glowing like that). Women with a lot of makeup on also catch my eye.     I love the extremes. It's fascinating to see that someone's far up on either end of the spectrum. It says they're not afraid of being different. And those are the people I gravitate toward, because that's me. Q. Where do your ideas come from? A. I get a lot from children. I look at my niece -- her little cherub cheeks, rosy lips, long blond eyelashes, dark eyebrows -- and I think: \"That's it! That's the makeup for the show!\"     It's not at all about making women look just like little girls, either. It's just that my niece inspired me, just like I get ideas from old movies I watch. Q. Where do fashion and beauty go now? A. That depends on what happens in politics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"A Hot Investment Entices, But It's Not Always Wise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/us/a-hot-investment-entices-but-it-s-not-always-wise.html","abstract":"  Do you pay too much in taxes?

That mission failed disastrously, and as German film exports under the Nazis fell, Goebbels turned his efforts toward conquering the audience at home. His theory was that propaganda worked best when an audience didn't know it was there. So while emigrant German film makers like Fritz Lang successfully planted the roots of film noir in Hollywood, those who stayed behind were given the far more difficult task of transplanting the light, optimistic American style to the Third Reich -- of creating a dream factory in hell.   The resulting Nazi doppelganger of Hollywood is on view in \"The Ministry of Illusion: German Film 1933-45,\" starting Friday at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which is a co-sponsor with Goethe House.

Now, after years of fruitless debate, a solution may have arrived: A growing shortage of applicants is forcing the country's universities to consider the most farreaching changes since their founding.    Demographics rather than a shift in values is behind the new thinking. The birth rate is tumbling and Japanese society is aging with remarkable speed. Within 30 years the number of people over 65 will soar to 25 percent of the population, from the current 12 percent. The number of 18-year-olds peaked in 1992, and is expected to drop steadily in coming years.    Yoshiya Abe, an expert on education policy at Aichi Gakiun University, near Nagoya, said there would be 20 percent fewer university applicants in the year 2000, a figure that is sending shock waves through Japan's educational factories.    Now universities, which traditionally accepted only the students they wanted after putting them through a battery of mind-numbing exams, are changing their standards as they compete for students. They are accepting students based on recommendations or skill in sports like rugby. In other words, students are slowly finding their outside interests encouraged rather than regarded as distractions from the tasks of memorizing dates and facts.    In another change, universities have begun to trim costs. Up to now, parents have paid vast sums to insure their children spots at good universities because diplomas from the right schools -- rather than the student's academic record -- have been the most important criteria for jobs at the best companies and government ministries.    In a startling report issued earlier this year, the Government found that Japanese parents with two children spent nearly 16 percent of their incomes on education -- with much of it on cram schools to prepare youngsters for the rigorous and minutely detailed entrance exams at middle schools, high schools and universities. By contrast, the survey found, American parents spend on average less than 3 percent of their income on their children's education.

From the conventional to the outlandish, Ms. Andrews portrays an extraordinary range of subjects: a World War II veteran, shyly proud in his American Legion cap; the pastor of the Full Truth Unity Fellowship of Christ Church, singing a gospel song, eyes closed in ecstasy; a cowboy, muscular and self-assured, who rides on the gay rodeo circuit; a lesbian garden club in Georgia called the Digging Dykes of Decatur; even a Mardi Gras \"krewe\" or club, featuring transvestites in Las Vegas-style beaded costumes. Though the more eccentric photos grab attention, the substance of the book lies in its soulful depiction of people as simply themselves. Ms. Andrews's portraits are filled with texture and natural light and reveal a skillful photographer who makes her subjects comfortable. The text conveys each person's story and manner of speaking, and varies from rambling to eloquent. \"Family\" affirms gay men and lesbians in all their diversity, while widening the reader's image of what a family can be.

The bright, rectangular dining room, with its benches of polished wood, is festive and informal.  The attentive staff does not allow the conspicuously helpless to go unattended.

But did his name come up in connection with \"Pulp Fiction,\" a movie that some say transformed movie making? We think not.    Instead, it can be argued that Danny DeVito is not only the most powerful man in Hollywood but also the center of the universe. Through this actor-director-producer-beautician, anyone could theoretically get to anyone else. Producing, through his company Jersey Films, has made Mr. DeVito's reach all encompassing. The company's productions run the gamut of subjects (and studios) from \"Hoffa\" (20th Century Fox) to \"Reality Bites\" (Universal) to \"Pulp Fiction\" (Miramax). Next up: \"Get Shorty\" (MGM), starring John Travolta and \"Feeling Minnesota\" (New Line Cinema), starring Keanu Reeves. Mr. DeVito will also direct \"Matilda,\" based on the Roald Dahl children's book, for Universal. Here's how Mr. DeVito Links up to the universe. JOSH YOUNG GRAMMY WINNERS    Mr. DeVito appeared in \"Ruthless People\" with Bette Midler, opened for Barbra Streisand at a benefit for Bill Clinton and was born in Asbury Park, N.J., the town Bruce Springsteen put on the map. PEOPLE WITH TELEVISIONS    Nearly everyone remembers Mr. DeVito from the series \"Taxi.\" \"People pat me on the back, and say, 'Hey, how are Rhea and the kids?\"' Mr. DeVito said. Anyone deprived of \"Taxi\" has certainly been to \"Cheers,\" where Mr. DeVito's real-life wife, Rhea Periman, served drinks as Carla. WORLD LEADERS (INCLUDING MICHAEL OVITZ)    In \"Junior,\" which opens on Nov. 26, an airline flight attendant (played by Judy Ovitz, wife of Michael Ovitz) tries to eject the DeVito character from the First-class cabin. \"Let's face it, Danny knows everyone,\" says Ivan Reitman, the film's director. Also co-starring: Emma Thompson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Kennedy spouse and head of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during the Bush Administration. GENERATION X    For a 50-year-old, Mr. DeVito has impeccable credentials with 20-somethings. \"Reality Bits,\" directed by Ben Stiller, 28, and written by Helen Childress, 24, is known as the definitive Gen-X movie. If not for Mr. DeVito and his partner, Michael Shamberg, backing this film, the revival of the Knack's hit \"My Sharona\" might be years away. ALUMNI OF THE WILFRED ACADEMY OF HAIR AND BEAUTY CULTURE    The Wilfred Academy once had 58 branches in the New York area. After completing his studies in Asbury Park in 1964, Mr. DeVito got his beautician's license and practiced at his sister's salon. Told that all Wilfred outlets are now closed, Mr. DeVito sheepishly admitted, \"I haven't kept up with my alma mater.\" NEW HOLLYWOOD    Jersey Films has made movies at nearly every studio except its home base, Columbia Pictures, so it shouldn't be surprising if the company gets a film going with the new studio formed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen. During Mr. Katzenberg's reign at Walt Disney Studios, Mr. DeVito starred in three Disney films: \"Tin Men,\" \"Ruthless People\" and \"Renaissance Man.\" OLD HOLLYWOOD    Mr. DeVito's first turn on the golf course was with Jack Nicholson, a close friend since they appeared together in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest \" (1975). \"I played 18 holes my first time out, and I lost every ball in Jack's bag,\" Mr. DeVito said. \"Michael\" -- Michael Douglas, a pal since the 70's and a collaborator on four DeVito films -- \"is a golf enthusiast too, but I'm not getting out there with him.\" Mr. Nicholson's best friend is Warren Beatty. QUENTIN TARANTINO    Since the critical success of \"Pulp Fiction,\" Quentin Tarantino is a universe unto himself. Three years ago, Stacey Sher, president of Jersey Films, slipped Mr. DeVito and Michael Shamberg the script for \"Reservoir Dogs,\" then in production. Jersey Films bought Mr. Tarantino's next script, for \"Pulp Fiction,\" sight unseen and was the executive producer of the film, distributed through Miramax. \"The only guidance you need to give a guy that talented is what kind of lenses to use,\" Mr. DeVito said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Democrats On Defensive In a Handful Of Contests","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/the-1994-campaign-legislature-democrats-on-defensive-in-a-handful-of-contests.html","abstract":"  The Democrats are on the defensive in a handful of contested legislative races around New York State this year, and while the Republicans could pick up seats in both the Assembly and the Senate, the gains would not upset the balance of power in either house and seem unlikely to have any sway in the death-penalty debate.

annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting. APEC is an 18-member group of Pacific Rim countries that includes China and Japan. On the agenda is a proposal to create by 2020 the world's largest free-trade and investment zone -- a dramatic symbol of America's tilt toward soaring opportunities in Asia and away from the enervated economies of Western Europe.    Mr. Clinton pushed Nafta, the accord with Mexico and Canada, through Congress over the opposition of important Democratic constituencies. He also signed, along with more than 100 trading partners, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- which Congress will vote on after the elections. An APEC accord is an enticing next step. APEC members account for about half of the world's economic output; yet the U.S. share of trade and investment in the group is falling. A trade agreement would guarantee fair access, a key to U.S. growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"Republican Leader Practices Nonchalance in Tough Campaign","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/us/1994-campaign-georgia-republican-leader-practices-nonchalance-tough-campaign.html","abstract":"  He has never been accused of being at a loss for words, but Newt Gingrich needs only two to respond to speculation that his race for Congress in suburban Atlanta may not be the cakewalk that had been anticipated.   \"Who cares?\" Mr. Gingrich said before addressing the pumped-up Republicans checking out T-shirts and bumper stickers reading \"Bill Lied,\" \"Visualize No Liberals\" and \"Rush for President\" inside Vittle's Restaurant here on Saturday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941107","headline":"Parking Rules","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/nyregion/parking-rules-757977.html","abstract":"  Because of Election Day, alternate-side street cleaning regulations will be suspended in New York City tomorrow.

Mario Cuomo as soft on crime. The case of Thomas Grasso, a twice-convicted murderer, is not a test of toughness but rather a test of fidelity to law, and the winner is the Governor.    Last week the Republican challenger stood outside a Staten Island boarding house where Mr. Grasso killed an 81-year-old fellow resident in 1991 and accused Governor Cuomo of refusing, arbitrarily and on ideological grounds, to send Mr. Grasso to Oklahoma where he is under a death sentence for a murder there. He repeated the bogus charge over the weekend, perhaps hoping to close the campaign with a last round of death-penalty politics.

all bridge deals, neither partnership owns the 26 high-card points indicating that game should be bid. And on those deals it is more likely than not that both sides will be bidding. Judging how far to bid in these competitive auctions is crucial, and not well understood.   The first major book on this subject was the best-selling \"To Bid or Not to Bid: The Law of Total Tricks,\" by Larry Cohen, published two years ago. The sequel, \"Following the Law,\" deals with refinements of the basic idea. It is available for $15.95, including mailing, from the author at 181 Longhill Road, Bldg.

Preston's thought-provoking, troubling and ultimately misleading Op-Ed article (\"Killing Pain, Ending Life,\" Nov. 1). The case he describes is far from adequate for making medical and ethical decisions about appropriate care. From the short description given, I wonder why a person with \"intermittent\" pain was placed on a continuous infusion of morphine. In addition, morphine drips for pain management are supposed to be adjusted to maintain patient comfort, not to intentionally decrease respiration. I wonder if the case described was an example of poor medical management rather than an appropriate indictment of an extremely valuable and perhaps underused therapy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"Debate on Whose Voice Is Heard in Initiatives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/us/the-1994-campaign-ballot-measures-debate-on-whose-voice-is-heard-in-initiatives.html","abstract":"  In a new wave of direct democracy, voters across the country will vote on Tuesday on a wide variety of ballot measures to limit taxes, permit gambling, increase punishment for crime and limit the tenure of elected officials.

The shooting occurred just after 9 P.M. when the bodega owner, Salvatore Matos, and the former employee resisted several armed men who entered the store, the Espinal Bodega, at 279 Woodbine Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. The former employee, 35, who was not identified by the police, was taken to Woodhull Hospital, where he was in stable condition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"After 3 Years, Abducted Girls Return to Mother","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/nyregion/after-3-years-abducted-girls-return-to-mother.html","abstract":"  A New Jersey mother's determined struggle to find her two young daughters, abducted by her estranged husband nearly three years ago and taken to Pakistan, ended happily yesterday with tears of joy when they were reunited at Kennedy International Airport.   \"This is the happiest day of my life,\" said the mother, Virginia Ramos, of Union City. \"My only fear is that their father will try to take them away from me again.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"So Strong, So Vulnerable","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/sports/pro-football-so-strong-so-vulnerable.html","abstract":"  Under the harsh stadium lights and in front of an assemblage of ill-tempered men who are intent on knocking him down or knocking him out, Troy Aikman, peering across the green field and about to take the snap, must block out the possibilities of catastrophe.

Portraying Laura Lee Weems, a small-town, family-smothered spinster in \"Night Seasons,\" the drama by her father, Horton Foote, at the Signature Theater Company, she seems at first a curtained character, absorbing the disappointments her small world deals her with a polite self-containment kept in place by a flicker of hope.   But toward the middle of the first act, there comes a moment when Laura Lee, who has just learned of the marriage of a former suitor, seems to hear one door too many closing behind her. All Ms. Foote does is look directly into the audience, but in such a manner that you may want to turn away. Her gaze brims with the realization that her life is a cul-de-sac. And though she soon steps back into the harness of civilized convention that guides her through each day, the play has acquired a haunting throb it won't shake for the rest of the evening.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"Where To Listen For Sounds Of Summer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/sports/baseball-where-to-listen-for-sounds-of-summer.html","abstract":"  In a cramped Manhattan conference room, the baseball owners plan their season.

With both camps sensing a close and volatile race, the candidates relied on last-minute help from -- and contrasting appeals to -- the biggest group of undecided voters: women. Mr. Pataki wrapped himself in the Republican tax-cutting credentials of Gov.

Brian Eno first codified a philosophy of sound as atmosphere in the 1970's; long before him, though, Erik Satie introduced the notion of musique d'ameublement, a furniture music that the audience was supposed to hear with comfortable inattention. And in a sense, much music written before Haydn and Mozart was ambient: the Baroque genre of Tafel musik, or table music, was intended as background for aristocratic dinner conversation.   Modern ambient music, however, makes more complex demands. It does not serve as the background for unrelated events; rather, like certain modes of Minimalism, it aims to wrap the audience in its sensuous embrace, excluding more conscious forms of activity. Rather than sitting composedly in chairs, listeners lie on the floor, or maybe dance. Ambient music overlaps heavily with the dense, overwhelming dance sound of techno and rave.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"The 4 Possible Governors On a Final Weekend Tour","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/nyregion/the-1994-campaign-connecticut-the-4-possible-governors-on-a-final-weekend-tour.html","abstract":"  John G.

But Philip Jerry's \"Our Town,\" performed by the American Repertory Ballet here tonight at the State Theater, is not just an unfashionable narrative dance. The piece is also based on a play that develops slowly and is full of nuances of a sort not easily expressed in ballet. Mr. Jerry's dance, dedicated to his mother, is filled with the spirit of the Thornton Wilder classic, but it also succeeds in dramatic and pure dance terms.    Mr. Jerry's retelling of the story is fairly simple. He introduces these small-town characters promptly in a seamless flow of small encounters and events. He establishes young Emily Webb's relationship with her parents immediately, at the same time creating a sense of her tumultuous embrace of life. Her growing love for handsome young George Gibbs is also clearly charted, as is his initially bashful love for her. Emily's death and return are handled with an almost painful simplicity as well as a good deal of ingenious staging.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941107","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/07/nyregion/chronicle-757918.html","abstract":"  HADDA BROOKS always played the same role in movies of the 1940's and 50's: the sultry singer at the piano in nightclubs frequented by Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas or George Brent.

The key may lie in an ancient brain structure thought to coordinate body movements, according to a brash theory on brain evolution that has gained backing from new research.   The theory holds that modern humans evolved when areas of the cerebellum, the part of the brain just above the brain stem that controls movement, and frontal parts of the higher cortex both expanded. At the time, rudimentary connections between them also expanded, forming a unique circuit. This expanded circuit, which is not found in other primates or vertebrates, may have resulted from a mutation in one or more genes that help shape the developing brain, said Dr. Henrietta Leiner, who developed the theory a decade ago with her husband, Dr. Alan Leiner. The part of the brain that gives humans motor dexterity enlarged to give them mental dexterity, she said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941108","headline":"COLLEGE SOCCER REPORT","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/08/sports/college-soccer-report-762733.html","abstract":"  Atlantic Coast Conference  North Carolina State captured the regular-season title with a record of 5-1 and was awarded a bye in the first round of the conference tournament, which will be staged at Clemson starting Thursday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941108","headline":"Ex-Officer Is Charged In Abduction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/08/nyregion/ex-officer-is-charged-in-abduction.html","abstract":"  A retired Garden City police sergeant was charged today with kidnapping and sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy he \"arrested\" for stealing a pocketbook, the police said.
