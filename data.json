How do squirrels find the nuts they have buried?    A.  They seem to have a very good memory for where they put things, said Dr. Lucia Jacobs of the University of Utah, who has studied the matter firsthand.   Wild squirrels' burial behavior gave some clues to the question. In a small-scale study in a 15-acre tract of woods adjoining the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., she focused on gray squirrels dining on hickory nuts. An account of her research was published in Natural History magazine in October 1989.   Before burying a nut, she observed, wild squirrels removed the fragrant husk, reducing the chance of using smell to find it, but also reducing the chance that its hiding place would be obvious to other squirrels. She carefully observed the digging of a hole an inch or two deep. The nut was dropped in, then slowly and painstakingly covered with dirt and camouflaged with ground litter, reducing visual clues to other squirrels.   To address the question of memory, she used hand-reared squirrels allowed out one at a time to bury nuts in an outdoor arena. They were then returned to their cages for 2 to 12 days.

Litt, State Department director of Northern Gulf affairs: Mr. Litt's statement that the Administration's report will draw \"heavily on the People's Mujahedeen's own stated views\" is unconvincing. The department has acted to the contrary.   In a Congressional hearing this week, Robert Pelletreau, Assistant Secretary for Near East affairs, asserted the Mujahedeen had acknowledged responsibility for the deaths of American nationals and had taken part in the seizure of American diplomats as hostages in Teheran. Both statements are false. The Mujahedeen have denied both allegations.   Mr. Litt's letter is full of baseless allegations that originate in the Irangate deals and were part of the demands of the Khomeini regime. These allegations have never been substantiated, and have already been answered by the Mujahedeen.   These responses have been ignored by the State Department, whose declared positions over the last six months contradict the objective study needed to prepare the report. The compilers have made up their minds, violating impartiality.   The problem is not the Mujahedeen but those in the State Department who advocate a policy of appeasing Teheran. They view discrediting Iran's democratic oppoosition as the only way to justify reconciliation with an international outlaw.   Congress and the public have made their will known: Don't appease the mullahs, don't prejudge, be objective, listen to all voices, particularly the subjects of the report.

In standard news magazine fashion, there are snapshots and home movies of the pretty children before they were stricken, followed by grim hospital scenes. The reporter, Meredith Vieira, goes on to accuse the Federal Department of Agriculture of not doing enough to protect consumers from contaminated meat.   As journalists long ago discovered, nothing is more moving than the death of a child, and you can't help feeling for the parents who lost their children because a fast-food chain served hamburgers containing a lethal bacteria. The step from sympathy to indignation at officialdom for not preventing the deaths is easy. Too easy, perhaps, and tonight's expose, like most of its sort, never confronts the question of whether the costs of the tighter regulation demanded by parents and \"meat safety activists\" would be justified.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941012","headline":"Pine Chip Gets the Rail","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/12/sports/pine-chip-gets-the-rail.html","abstract":"  Pine Chip, the world's fastest trotter, who will be making the final start of his career, drew the rail yesterday for the $300,000 Cadillac Breeders' Crown Open Trot at Freehold Raceway Saturday.

Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said today.   The project, the first in the nation to dismantle a licensed commercial nuclear reactor, cost several million dollars less than the $186 million projected. Mr. Kessel said the authority \"got away cheaply\" performing a task that would eventually confront operators of more than 100 commercial reactors now in operation.   \"This is an historic day, not just for the people of Long Island, but for the country,\" he said at a news conference inside the former reactor building.   The plant, proposed in the mid-1960's, never went into commercial operation. Because of fears that safe evacuation of the surrounding area would be impossible in the event of an accident, the former owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, sold Shoreham to the state for $1 in 1992 in an agreement intended to block its operation.   Mr. Kessel said removing the radioactive waste that was produced during testing required 353 truck shipments of more than 5 million pounds of waste to burial and reprocessing sites in South Carolina and Tennessee.   The authority also shipped 560 irradiated fuel assemblies by barge from the plant, which is on Long Island Sound about 60 miles east of Manhattan, to the Philadelphia Electric Company's power plant in Limerick, Pa. The last of 33 barge shipments was made in June.   The pool where fuel rods were stored was drained and irradiated surfaces were ground away, officials said. They said no radiation above normal background levels remained inside the reactor building.   Mr. Kessel today signed a letter informing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that all radioactive material had been removed and other steps taken to comply with decommissioning regulations. He said he expected final approval from the agency by next year to lift all restrictions on use of the plant.   The authority has been studying a possible conversion of Shoreham to a gas-fired power plant.   Construction of Shoreham began in 1973. The plant was nearly completed by 1984, but public opposition to its opening and a lengthy dispute between the company and state and Suffolk County officials over emergency evacuation plans delayed issuance of a Federal operating license until April 1989.   By then the company had agreed with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to abandon the plant in exchange for rate increases and other financial compensation.    A Lilco spokeswoman, Elaine Davis, said today: \"It's been five years since we signed the settlement agreement. We are glad they have completed the decommissioning.\"   Mr. Kessel, who is also the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, said Governor Cuomo deserved credit for closing the plant. He said operating the plant would have cost Lilco customers, who pay among the highest electric rates in the nation, an additional $1 billion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/c-corrections-517100.html","abstract":"  A chart in Business Day on Oct. 5, about the effects of a 1978 law that requires utilities to buy power from independent generators, misstated the rates that New York State utilities charge residential customers.

Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar.   While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble; called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers.   Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21.   In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called \"Black Tuesday\" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an \"unmasking trial,\" the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era.   But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence.   \"I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors,\" said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. \"But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame.\"   Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market.   After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured.    Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.)    Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now.   During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar.    With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today.   But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies.   During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. \"Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises,\" he said. If the latter, \"the ruble will continue to fall.\"   Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded.   As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases.   Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation.    Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment.   \"Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen,\" Mr. Lindbaek said. \"In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold.\"   Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs.   Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: \"Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies.\"    Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. \"In contrast to the Russian Government,\" he said, \"the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you.\"   Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. \"We understand what has happened better than anyone,\" she said. \"We understand it with our pockets.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"When Opting to Insult Is Really No Surprise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/metro-matters-when-opting-to-insult-is-really-no-surprise.html","abstract":"  AT that now-infamous police rally at City Hall two years ago, the one that got out of hand over the issue of civilianizing the complaint review board, some speakers attacked Mayor David N.

Dr. Gunn had divided his time among six abortion clinics in Georgia, Florida and Alabama. On July 29, 1994, Dr. John B. Britton was also killed by an anti-abortion activist. Dr. Britton regularly flew from his home elsewhere in Florida to work at Pensacola's only other abortion clinic.    The physician who reportedly succeeded Dr. Britton, Steven Chase Brigham, is equally peripatetic. In the last two years his medical license was suspended in New York and Georgia and restricted in New Jersey and California amid accusations of improper procedures. Anyone looking for proof of the shortage of abortion providers in the United States has only to look to Dr. Gunn's 1,000-mile-a-week marathons, Dr. Britton's cross-state commuting and Dr. Brigham's record. The murders of Dr. Gunn and Dr. Britton are stark proof that the small number of people still performing abortions are working in a war zone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"The WHO Record : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/opinion/IHT-the-who-record-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"An Ongoing Torture\" (Letters, Sept. 22) from E.
