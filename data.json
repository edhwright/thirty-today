The Breeders are led by the ever-smiling Kim Deal on rhythm guitar; she used to play bass for the Pixies, and the songs she writes still have bass lines that swagger and pump. Above them, Kelley Deal (Kim's sister) plays tersely melodic guitar licks, while Kim Deal strums distorted chords on an acoustic guitar and sings in a voice that can be breathy, raw or girlishly winsome.    For the length of a few verses and few choruses, the music has all the confidence of its roots in 1960's surf rock and garage rock; it's lean, brash pop. But in alternative rock, nothing arrives unmixed. The Breeders' songs shift abruptly from soft to loud, and they stop and start, mocking their own momentum; they end suddenly, as if determined not to overstay their welcome. It's a twist on the unquestioning arrogance of previous, overwhelmingly male rock bands, a skepticism made more explicit when Josephine Wiggs, on bass, sang a deadpan version of Aerosmith's \"Lord of the Thighs.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930913","headline":"RU-486: When?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/13/opinion/ru-486-when.html","abstract":"  RU-486, the French-manufactured \"abortion pill\" which should be available here in about two years, has been used safely by thousands of Europeans.

It is also a pill that may have far wider application -- provided its manufacturer, Roussel-Uclaf, is willing to brave America's anti-abortion activists. A recent study by a National Academy of Sciences panel found great potential in antiprogestins, a class of drug used in RU-486. \"There appear to be a lot more uses for these drugs than simply as abortive agents,\" the panel's chairman, Dr. Leslie Z.

The problem for the Administration is with television itself.   Discussions of the agreement, like those on the \"MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,\" have been performed through a glass dimly. It takes a powerful dose of civic responsibility to sit through the opposing predictions and predilections; the screen turns as smoggy as Mexico City.

The other murder victims in Miami -- black, white and Hispanic -- fail to get such attention because their fate is, sad to say, commonplace in this increasingly violent society.

David Fonseca scored the winning goal during injury time at the end of the first half at Centenario Stadium in Montevideo, Uruguay. With only one round remaining in South American Group B, neither of the two berths is settled. Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay all have 10 points with Sunday's two games to decide the issue. Bolivia, once seemingly secure in its bid for a World Cup bid, and Brazil need a draw to qualify. Uruguay needs a victory, or a draw and a Bolivian loss, to get to next summer's World Cup in the United States. (AP) AUTO RACING Hill Wins in Italy as Prost's Engine Blows Damon Hill had a bad start and a good finish in the Italian Grand Prix yesterday in Monza, Italy. His French teammate, Alain Prost, had quite the reverse. Jean Alesi of France thrilled Italian fans by driving a Ferrari to second place, and Michael Andretti finished third, his best Formula One finish this year, in a McLaren-Ford. Andretti, who fought back in the second half of the race after spinning off in the second lap, said he was delighted to have made his first trip to the podium in Formula One. Prost, a 38-year-old French veteran, saw his Renault engine explode four and a half laps from the checkered flag and from his fourth world title. He led for 48 laps after roaring off from the pole position. (AP) Fittipaldi Is Still in the Race: Emerson Fittipaldi kept the Indy-car championship battle alive with a runaway victory in the Pioneer Electronics 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. It was a turnaround for Fittipaldi, who had been struggling since winning at Portland, Ore., on June 27, and a day of missed opportunities for PPG Cup point leader, Nigel Mansell, and Fittipaldi's teammate, Paul Tracy. Mansell, who went into the 199.3-mile, 89-lap race with a 34-point lead over Fittipaldi and a 47-point lead over Tracy, started from the pole and had a good chance to wrap up the championship with two races remaining.

But critics of pop culture usually put the emphasis in the wrong place, thinking in terms of artists, originality and creativity instead of the audience's needs. The wildly cheering sellout crowd for Aerosmith had probably seen the same routine dozens of times before, and it didn't care a bit. There's a clear need, culturally, for some sort of transcendence in entertainment, and the band and its lead singer, Steven Tyler, were there to supply it.

Alfred A. Knopf. $22.     Like the heroines of Susanna Moore's other two novels (\"My Old Sweetheart\" and \"The Whiteness of Bones\"), Clio Lynott is an \"island girl,\" a girl brought up in the fierce, Edenic beauty of Hawaii, and unprepared for the confusions and seductions of that other world that lies, beckoning, on the other side of the ocean. Like theirs, hers is the story of a woman's search for identity and her attempt to mediate between the claims of the past and the present, family and self, home and the world.   Clio is the cousin of Mamie, the heroine of \"The Whiteness of Bones,\" and she shares Mamie's tortuous family history. Clio's great-grandmother was a full Hawaiian princess who married a shipwrecked Irish sailor in 1871; her dowry, Ms. Moore writes, included \"a coastal plain on the island of O'ahu that was one day to become the city of Honolulu.\" Her house, once the center of all that was lovely in island society, has been handed down to Clio's eccentric aunt Emma, the self-appointed custodian of the family's past.   Clio's own immediate family has disintegrated, a victim of the centrifugal forces of selfishness and dislocation. Her mother, Kitty, a flighty, impulsive woman vaguely reminiscent of Lily's mother in \"My Old Sweetheart,\" has abandoned Clio and her brother, Dix, to start a new life with a new husband in Australia; she occasionally mails Clio presents -- a flea- bitten ermine muff, a stained bed jacket, an alligator handbag with a broken clasp -- then later asks for them back.   Clio's father, John Lynott, is an equally negligent parent. He marries a cruel, mocking woman named Burta and allows her to terrorize his children: Burta starves Clio and Dix, humiliates them and kills their beloved pets. Unable to cope any longer, Clio runs away from home to live with her aunt Emma.   Emma's house, formerly the princess' town residence, is filled with treasures from Hawaii's past: feather capes from the time of Kamehameha I, carved idols with abalone-shell eyes, koa chests filled with musty, fragrant antiques. And Emma has set herself the task of preserving Hawaii's less tangible treasures from the past: the long songs without meter or rhyme known as meles, the oral genealogies of its island families, its hulas and its myths of gods and goddesses and spirits. Knowledge of such matters is disappearing in the new Hawaii of tourists and fancy hotels, and she wants Clio to become \"the next keeper of the flame\"; she wants Clio to become the repository of the family's and the islands' history.   This dedication to the past has already warped the lives of Emma and her mother, Mabel. Many years ago, each of them gave up the chance to run away with the man she loved to stay on at the family homestead. Both now live willfully in the past: Emma spends hours recording and memorizing \"the lore of her race\"; Mabel actually thinks she's living in a bygone era, inviting the likes of Mark Twain and Jack London for tea.   Clio dutifully absorbs her aunt's lessons, and she soon finds she can \"no longer separate what had happened a hundred years earlier from what she had dreamed in the night.\" \"She used to say laughingly,\" Ms. Moore writes, \"that she knew the ritual ceremony for wrapping the bones of a chief, but she could not divide fractions. She could steer an outrigger canoe through rough seas, but she had never learned to iron.\"   The weight of her family's past, however, has begun to suffocate Clio, and she yearns to explore the bright, mysterious world beyond Hawaii's shores. At the age of 27, she meets and marries a movie star named Tommy Haywood, a modern-day Prince Charming who is her complete opposite, a man without a past, a man who lives relentlessly in the present. Tommy -- who seems to have been modeled on another Tom, Tom Buchanan, the hard-nosed, careless husband of Daisy in \"The Great Gatsby\" -- takes Clio away to California and introduces her to a world of rich, vapid movie people, a farcical West Coast version of the frivolous world of New York socialites encountered by Mamie in \"The Whiteness of Bones.\"   This world is delineated in overly bright comic-book colors of greed, stupidity and shallowness, very different from the lyrically described world of Hawaii rendered in a shimmering chiaroscuro of soft, tropical tints; and it's consequently hard to understand why someone as thoughtful and intelligent as Clio would linger there for even a moment. And yet she does linger, convinced that Tommy has awakened her from years of sleepwalking, convinced that she has escaped the fate of her aunt and her grandmother. It is only when her marriage comes to a sudden and violent end that she is forced to return home to Hawaii and finally grapple with her family's emotional legacy.   Clearly \"Sleeping Beauties\" would be a better novel if Ms. Moore had modulated her satire of Tommy's Hollywood world and depicted the people surrounding Clio in more muted, realistic terms. As it is, Tommy and Clio's father and stepmother are cardboard villains, devoid of any real emotional reality, and hence flimsy foils to Clio's dreams and aspirations.   What redeems the book is Ms. Moore's persuasive ability to delineate Clio's inner life and the place she has come from. Clio's childhood in Hawaii and her relationships with her aunt and grandmother are so fervently and authentically described that we feel we know her, not just as a character, but also as a flesh-and-blood human being.

The tragic clash of Western and Japanese cultures was examined in \"Madama Butterfly\" on Saturday afternoon, and the legend of the vengeful ice princess \"Turandot\" was offered that evening. And perhaps to sweep away the tense emotionalism of those works, on Sunday afternoon the company revived its 1984 production of \"The Mikado,\" Gilbert and Sullivan's deliciously silly fantasy about the Japanese town of Titipu, and its odd web of bureaucratic and romantic entanglements.   Lightweight though \"The Mikado\" is, this production is one of the most delightful in the company's repertory, and it has retained its freshness. Originally staged by Lotfi Mansouri, and now directed by Christian Smith, it plays on subtle contrasts. Thierry Bosquet's sets, for example, are delicate Oriental hangings and screens, painted in pastel shades. But his costumes use bright reds and greens. There is a spareness that makes the stage seem roomy, yet the bustling crowds are on hand when Gilbert calls for them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"Dolphins Put Humphrey on Injured List","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/sports/sports-people-pro-football-dolphins-put-humphrey-on-injured-list.html","abstract":"  Running back BOBBY HUMPHREY was placed on injured reserve yesterday, insuring the end of his tumultuous tenure with the Miami Dolphins. The move, made after a slight cartilage tear was discovered in Humphrey's left knee, means he can't play for the Dolphins this season.   Humphrey will undergo arthroscopic surgery and is expected to be healthy again in six to eight weeks. The Dolphins then have the option of waiving Humphrey, which would allow him to play for another team this season. Otherwise, he becomes a free agent after the season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/arts/classical-music-in-review-531093.html","abstract":"  Beethoven Festival  Planting Fields Arboretum Oyster Bay, L.I.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"Let the Yugoslavs Vote : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/opinion/IHT-let-the-yugoslavs-vote-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"With negotiations between the parties involved in the ex-Yugoslavia drama again in an impasse, one wonders whether a totally different approach could offer a glimmer of hope.

Jim Florio escorted the United States Attorney General around the state today.   During a morning news conference in Hackensack, Ms. Reno and Mr. Florio stood side-by-side near a table covered with semiautomatic weapons and called for a national ban that would mirror legislation that New Jersey adopted in 1990. The New Jersey law bans the sale and restricts the possession of semiautomatic weapons. The passage of the ban, and Mr. Florio's defeat of a Republican-led effort to rescind it, are two of the successes of his first term, and the Governor has strived mightily to keep them before the public.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930914","headline":"MIDEAST ACCORD: The Overview; RABIN AND ARAFAT SEAL THEIR ACCORD AS CLINTON APPLAUDS 'BRAVE GAMBLE'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/14/world/mideast-accord-overview-rabin-arafat-seal-their-accord-clinton-applauds-brave.html","abstract":"  In a triumph of hope over history, Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel, and Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., shook hands today on the White House lawn, sealing the first agreement between Jews and Palestinians to end their conflict and share the holy land along the River Jordan that they both call home.

Short started the encounter bristling with aggression, putting on the board one of the most demanding speculative attacks known to the game.
