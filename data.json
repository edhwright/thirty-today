A documentary film about black G.I.'s liberating Jewish concentration camp prisoners during World War II brought an audience of 1,200 blacks and Jews to tears. They spoke of common ground, embraced and passionately agreed that together, they had experienced a rare, powerful moment -- a catharsis in the increasingly hostile relations between blacks and Jews in New York City.    But in the colder light of day, many wondered whether theirs was a lasting epiphany on race relations or a moment as fleeting as it was strongly felt. And yesterday, unlike the night before, not everyone could agree. Some considered the evening at the Apollo a turning point, while others feared the truce would be about as permanent as those jaunty waves across the trenches between British and German soldiers in the early days of World War I.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"New Work Corps Could Change People's Lives; California-Style","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/opinion/l-new-work-corps-could-change-people-s-lives-california-style-630092.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Stephen Ambrose's suggestion to create a 1990's version of the Civilian Conservation Corps (Op-Ed, Nov. 28) certainly caught our attention.

Their three-year pledge of $18 billion was an encouraging sign of unflagging commitment by the nations that are better off, despite widespread recession and budget deficits.   In real terms, the new pledge is roughly equal to the last one, in 1989, but in effect it works out to a little less. Expanding populations and environmental protection stretch aid funds thinner; also, more governments, including the former Soviet republics, are likely to be seeking I.D.A. aid.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19921219","headline":"Review/Music; Johnny Cash, the Fatalist as Patriarch","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/19/arts/review-music-johnny-cash-the-fatalist-as-patriarch.html","abstract":"  Near the end of \"The Johnny Cash Show,\" the traveling family musicale that rolled into the Ritz on Wednesday night, the graying giant of country music settled down with his five-piece band to perform a succession of his signature hits. Singing \"I Walk the Line,\" \"Man in Black,\" \"I Got Stripes\" and \"I Guess Things Happen That Way,\" his rumbling bass-baritone cut to the bone of each song. And the packed house, knowing it was in the presence of a living monument, kept begging for more.    At 60 years of age, country music's \"Man in Black\" still seems almost as pure an embodiment of the severe, hard-bitten way of life that many of his songs chronicle as he did when he began recording in 1955. Casting himself as a cross between an itinerant preacher and a 19th-century highwayman, he has always used his sepulchral voice to express a dour, flinty fatalism that borders on the grim.

Mr. Zorn has always been fascinated by and suspicious of music's ability to suggest mood; most of his pieces jump from texture to texture, idiom to idiom, almost as soon as each one registers, as if refusing to manipulate the listener. But Mr. Zorn has also composed atmospheric pieces like \"Spillane,\" a soundtrack without a detective movie. The six sections of \"Kristallnacht\" use both fragmentation and longer dramatic arcs, yet with a pervasive mood of mourning and determination.    Before the performance there were recordings of bouncy 1930's cabaret songs and then, for about 15 minutes, the sounds of a train journey; standing in the dark, packed Knitting Factory on Wednesday night, it was easy to recognize an allusion to the sealed trains that carried people to concentration camps.

John Berger is simultaneously a Renaissance man and a recluse -- an English fiction writer, poet, art critic and philosopher, he lives in a tiny French Alpine village in a house without indoor plumbing. This collection of essays touches on both poles of his experience, from the meanings he finds in painting and photography to the metaphysical implications of cleaning his outhouse. In January our reviewer, Alison Lurie, said that \" 'Keeping a Rendezvous' should give only pleasure to its readers.\" Vintage International has also reissued LILAC AND FLAG: An Old Wives' Tale of a City ($11), the final novel in Mr. Berger's \"Into Their Labours\" trilogy.

Thirty-five color photographs by Shomei Tomatsu -- \"Photographs by Tomatsu: Sakura + Plastics\" -- propose a complex opposition. Rectangular, 35-millimeter pictures focus on pink cherry blossoms (\"sakura\"); they hang next to dark, nearly square photographs of plastics washed up on the beach. Though both series appear to be chiefly about visual pleasure, Tomatsu's vision of flowers turns out to be as ambiguous as his orderly images of pollution. The damaged environment beckons seductively; the prodigious displays of spring harbor hints of darkness.   His work, which in the late 1950's and 60's influenced such Japanese artists as the film maker Akira Kurosawa, has a certain authority and reserved elegance but breaks no new ground. In the cherry-tree pictures, blossom and branch, seen close on, choke the surface with a vigorous, wiry calligraphy the Abstract Expressionists would have admired. Lee Friedlander staked out this territory in black and white, in Japan, some dozen years ago, and long before, Japanese artists filled screens with snaking branches and soft explosions of blossom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"A Populist Inauguration: Jackson, With Decorum","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/us/the-transition-a-populist-inauguration-jackson-with-decorum.html","abstract":"  When President-elect Bill Clinton's big rock candy mountain moves from Little Rock to Washington, the contrast with previous inaugurations will be palpable, deliberate and historically aware. While there will be entertainment, fireworks and a multicultural festival on the Mall, it is clearly designed to contrast with the plutocratic touches of the Reagan and Bush inaugurations.   Because a partially open house at the White House is on the schedule the day after the inauguration, there is talk of recapturing the spirit of Andrew Jackson's first inauguration, on March 4, 1829. If so, the Clintons had better roll up the carpets and count the silver first. Contemporary accounts of General Jackson's inauguration serve to caution the Democratic residents of the White House about the wisdom of letting the People join in the fun too democratically.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Gems of the Desert","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/books/in-short-nonfiction-gems-of-the-desert.html","abstract":"  \"Walk in beauty,\" the Navajo blessing says, and SOUTHWESTERN INDIAN JEWELRY (Abbeville, $49.95) shows how generations of American Indian artists have achieved the balance, order and symmetry that phrase implies. Since ancient times, Indians have fashioned jewelry and religious artifacts from turquoise and shells, which signify sky and water, growth and renewal. With the introduction of silversmithing, modern tools and a greater variety of materials, Dexter Cirillo writes, younger artists are going far beyond traditional designs and are creating works of singular beauty and technical sophistication. Ms. Cirillo, an independent curator and dealer, discusses such influential earlier figures as Kenneth Begay, a silversmith known as the father of modern Navajo jewelry, and Charles Loloma, a Hopi who perfected the sculptural inlay technique. Each tribe has a distinctive style and preferred material for jewelry, Ms. Cirillo writes; for example, the Santo Domingo Pueblo people are known for their beadwork, the Zuni for their fine stone-cutting work. Ms. Cirillo also includes a collector's guide, glossary and tips on avoiding the purchase of fraudulent pieces. Stephen Northup provides excellent photographs of the artists, but Michel Monteaux's shots of the jewelry are the true glories of the book. With his skilled use of lighting and background, Mr. Monteaux manages to bring metal, wood, stone and shell to life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19921220","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/travel/q-and-a-148092.html","abstract":"  Cruising the Intracoastal   Q.

Putting their wits to the task, the    creme de la creme    of the Gypsy underworld converge on every Cadillac dealer in the San Francisco Bay area to execute a brilliant fraud that nets them 31 mint Caddys in a single day.

A laconic authority figure who would die to protect the woman he loves, the hero of \"The Bodyguard\" was conceived by Lawrence Kasdan 17 years ago with Steve McQueen in mind. That -- along with the geekiest haircut this side of basic training -- helps explain why the character seems to have walked out of the past.    In \"Forever Young,\" Mel Gibson    does    walk out of the past. In 1939, he is a brave test pilot, so despondent when the woman he loves is hopelessly injured that he volunteers to be frozen as part of a top-secret experiment.

I. Joes. Of course, the first Christmas gifts were the ones the three wise men presented to the infant Jesus: gold, frankincense and myrrh.

The three had conferred with King Herod, and he had made them his emissaries there.   Of the three gifts, two are well known. Both frankincense and myrrh are fragrant but bitter gums derived from plants of the region and were used to make perfume and incense.

His are the eyes the Nets envision someday leading the franchise to a National Basketball Association title. Far-fetched? Maybe, but Anderson is only a part of the Nets' talented youth movement, and title talk in New Jersey is not complete science fiction.

The God's-eye pictures are now available to the eye of flesh in the splendid ATLAS OF ROME: The Form of the City on a 1:1000 Scale Photomap and Line Map (Marsilio/Rizzoli, slipcased, $250).   The scale is such that not only every building but every automobile, tree, medium-size bush, row of vegetables (more of these than you might think) and almost every person, if standing in the sun, is represented on the 276 right-hand plates of the atlas; on the facing pages, the plan of every building at ground level is etched on a corresponding computer-prepared map, elevations are given, and most if not all streets are labeled. Buildings are not identified by name or number, so you may require another map to read this one; but, with some exceptions, a code on the left-hand page tells us whether each building is privately owned or belongs to the Government, the state, the city or the church. There are surprises here: the church does not own St. Agnese, St. Agostino or St. Ivo della Sapienza, three of the most important ecclesiastical monuments in the Piazza Navona area; the state owns them. The Pantheon is \"Parliamentary and Presidential\" property. The tomb of Augustus, the Ara Pacis and the pyramid of Caius Cestius are identified as private property. Here's food for wonder! Who's buried in Augustus' tomb? Who owns the pyramid of Caius Cestius, and    what does he do with it?

Looking at my own school, I see that there is not a lot of moral value in my classmates or even in myself. This is not to say that my school is in moral decay, but it is typical of most schools these days. Almost everyone uses foul language; teachers are often laughed at and not taken seriously, and classroom courtesy is at an all-time low when one person is constantly interrupting another person or shooting them down with some sarcastic statement.

A few hardy travelers penetrated the anti-Western bureaucracy to visit the southern region, a land of rare wildlife, lakes and tropical ice-capped mountains. But the northern highlands, with their rich history of Christianity, remote rock churches and a culture untouched by the outside world, remained out of bounds. A devastating civil war that gathered steam after the coming to power of the Communist regime in 1974 and ended in May 1991, presented a practical obstacle. Beyond that, the hunger, poverty and repression rendered tourism an inappropriate idea. Yet those Americans who have experienced Ethiopia -- humanitarian workers, diplomats, writers and even businessmen -- have often developed a lasting affinity with a people and culture that unlike the rest of Africa refused to succumb to European colonialism.   The curtain lifted on Ethiopia when the Marxist regime collapsed and war between the Government and rebels based in Tigre province came to an end. Since then a small trickle of visitors, which the Ethiopians hope will grow in numbers, have ventured through what the Ethiopians call the historic route.

The fisherman's sweater hasn't vanished -- in fact, it's been updated in lighter weights and in a range of colors beyond the classic off-white -- but young Irish designers are working with other yarns (cotton-linen mixes, mohair, alpaca, raw silk, rayon and viscose), other patterns, other concepts and other attitudes. Instead of boat decks and north-woods cabins, their sweaters suggest cocktails on the terrace, catered picnics, disco dancing and autumn in the city. Irish cultural traditions are an abiding inspiration, but new things are being done with them.   Although there are good knitwear shops in Kerry, Clare and other counties on the scenic route, the best selection of work by young Irish designers is to be found in and around Dublin.

Manhattan's 20th-century French Gothic cathedral, the colossus of Morningside Heights, is indeed absurd. Yet the century that has given us Camus, Genet and Steve Martin is one that has found in absurdity a redeeming spiritual grace. In this sense, at least, St. John's stained glass windows reflect our age as accurately as the glass curtain wall of an office tower designed by Mies van der Rohe. To paraphrase Beckett, the cathedral can't go on. It goes on. It has been going on since Dec. 27, 1892, when the cornerstone was laid. There have been interruptions. Now and then, the cathedral has halted construction to re-examine its motives or rethink its design. These ruminations have contributed to the impression that \"St. John the Unfinished\" is the existential cathedral, a building at once alienated and engaged.

At this particular performance, the original title seemed even more appropriate, for with the Czechoslovak soprano Gabriela Benackova singing Jenufa and Leonie Rysanek creating the role of her stepmother, the second act became a masterfully executed chamber opera, a psychological portrait of suffering and determination. The daughter, disappointed in love, bears an illegitimate child; the stepmother, disappointed in life, thinks she is protecting the girl by killing the newborn baby.

LONG ISLAND SOUND STATUS REPORT   The Long Island Sound is a vital but ecologically troubled estuary, threatened by pollution that pours into it every day from sewage-treatment plants, according to a preliminary report of a seven-year study of the Sound. The report recommends limiting the amount of nitrogen that flows from sewage plants into the Sound, a proposal that some say would stifle development in surrounding communities.

What direction is the government at Georgetown taking? Is it the right path? Is it moving, is it beginning to realize its potential?

Bothered by a worsening arthritic left elbow condition, Sandy Koufax retired after the 1966 season, a year he went 27-9 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Is this the biggest victory total a pitcher has posted in his final year in the major leagues? Has anyone else retired after a     20-victory season?      A. As usual, Koufax is in a class of his own, this time as the only 20-game winner to decide to call it quits before the next season. Two other pitchers -- Ed Cicotte and Lefty Williams, both of the Chicago White Sox -- also won 20 games in their final season in the majors, which was 1920 in both cases. But both had quits called for them by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball's first commissioner. Near the close of the 1920 season, Cicotte, Williams and six other White Sox players from the previous season were deemed by Landis to have had a role in fixing the 1919 World Series.
