He always conjured up visions of purity, line, grace and beauty.\n\n He also shared his talent unselfishly. While he made his name in solo figure skating, he was willing to exhaust all the abilities he had: his professional projects included efforts in pairs skating and ice dancing, always bringing innovation and freshness to the ice. And as great as he was, he was always encouraging, making his skating partners fell equally talented and special.\n\n Curry crossed the boundaries of sport and was recognized by the dance world. His collaboration with choreographers such as Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Twyla Tharp, Lar Lubovitch, Laura Dean and Peter Martins underscored his versatility.\n\n Some artists are encumbered by the restrictions inherent in their field.

The only thing certain is that U.S. fighter pilots mistook the helicopters for Iraqi craft and fired missiles at them, killing all 26 on board. Beyond that there are only questions. A needed investigation has already begun. Needed as well is a reconsideration of U.S. objectives in Iraq.

For the visitor, what is striking is the concentration in the room, to which the model, diligent but somewhat bored, provides a quiet counterpoint.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"U.S. Funds: The Best and the Brightest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/your-money/IHT-us-funds-the-best-and-the-brightest.html","abstract":"SMALL caps are risky.

Dr. Acer had quit practicing dentistry eight months earlier and was dying of AIDS; the investigator went to his home in Stuart, Fla., to tell him that a former patient had AIDS but no apparent risk factors for contracting the virus that causes it. The centers, she explained, wanted a blood sample to see if the genetic strain of his virus matched the patient's.\n\nThe DNA from Dr. Acer and his patient, Kimberly Bergalis, apparently did match. So began the strange case of the dentist who gave his patients AIDS -- a case that set off public hysteria, with its plaguelike implications, and prompted widespread calls for H.I.V. testing of health workers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"Court Asked To Reinstate Rape Counts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/nyregion/court-asked-to-reinstate-rape-counts.html","abstract":"  Acting as special prosecutor in a contentious rape case, State Attorney General G.

He always conjured up visions of purity, line, grace and beauty.\n\n He also shared his talent unselfishly. While he made his name in solo figure skating, he was willing to exhaust all the abilities he had: his professional projects included efforts in pairs skating and ice dancing, always bringing innovation and freshness to the ice. And as great as he was, he was always encouraging, making his skating partners fell equally talented and special.\n\n Curry crossed the boundaries of sport and was recognized by the dance world. His collaboration with choreographers such as Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Twyla Tharp, Lar Lubovitch, Laura Dean and Peter Martins underscored his versatility.\n\n Some artists are encumbered by the restrictions inherent in their field. Because Curry let nothing stand in his way, his limits were never defined.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"Most Programs for Dyslexic Children Succeed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/opinion/l-most-programs-for-dyslexic-children-succeed-807281.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I respond to \"A Disabilities Program That 'Got Out of Hand,' \" your April 8 front-page article about the Fisher Landau program for dyslexic children at the Dalton School in New York City, as a learning specialist, a member of the Fisher Landau advisory board, and as a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society (New York branch and national).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940416","headline":"Carlo Bergonzi Will Define 'Retirement' as He Wishes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/16/arts/carlo-bergonzi-will-define-retirement-as-he-wishes.html","abstract":"  Retirement for an opera singer means an end to instant recognition, stage-door groupies, recording projects, the pleasure of filling a theater with one's voice and the thrill of standing center stage and receiving cheers from packed houses.

She's the daughter of the king of Colchis, the granddaughter of the sun, a wife, a witch, a mother, a primeval terror in her own right. Medea is not a woman to be easily characterized. \"I am adept at everything that's hidden,\" she boasts to the women of Corinth. She then goes on to commit atrocities that astonish even her. To play her mostly as victim is to humble one of world literature's most titanic creations.    Yet even if the initial concept of the production is wrongheaded, the Euripides \"Medea\" now in a limited engagement at the Longacre Theater is efficient, polished and high-toned. It's also a theatrical event, marking the return to Broadway of Diana Rigg, who plays the title role, her first appearance in New York since 1975 and her bewitching performance as Celimene in \"The Misanthrope.\" Further, this \"Medea,\" directed by Jonathan Kent, is fashionably contemporary in its theatrical effects and in Alistair Elliot's new translation.

The great popular dissemination of art books and classical records in postwar America did not demean art and music, but created larger audiences for them. The CD-ROM disk speaks to the masses of children who are already interactive computer literati and opens up a world for them that is different from the Super Mario game world to which most of them are already addicted. The most highly motivated children will want to go to the National Gallery after using the CD-ROM anyway. They can use the disk to do papers in high school and college.

Born in Italy in 1896, Modotti emigrated in 1913 to the United States, where her natural beauty led to modeling jobs and roles in silent films. In Los Angeles she met Edward Weston, who documented her allure in some of his best-known photographs. They became lovers and traveled to Mexico together in 1923, where Modotti served as Weston's apprentice. Within a year, he returned to the States, leaving Modotti to run his studio; her career as a professional photographer soon took off. Poverty in Mexico affected her profoundly, and she began using her art to protest social injustice. She became a member of the Mexican Communist Party, and in 1930 she was deported. From then on, living in Berlin, Moscow, Paris or Spain (during its civil war), she more or less gave up taking pictures; her life revolved around radical politics. Offered the position of official photographer of the Soviet Communist Party, she turned it down. \"While she was too devoted to the party to risk disapproval or expulsion,\" Ms. Hooks writes, \"Tina was too much of an artist to see her work reduced to mere propaganda.\" Modotti's output comprises a scant 400 photographs, about 100 of which are reproduced in this book. They speak eloquently of her gift, revealing a true artistic eye and a formalist's sense of composition. Modotti died in Mexico City in 1942 at the age of 45, but she lives on through her art; her photograph \"Roses\" sold for $165,000 at Sotheby's in 1991.

So it was not surprising on a recent visit to discover New York cooks like Larry Forgione of An American Place and Richard Chiavari, formerly of the River Cafe, in Miami.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940417","headline":"New Jersey Q & A: Dr. Rebecca Stafford; Leading Change at Monmouth College","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/17/nyregion/new-jersey-q-a-dr-rebecca-stafford-leading-change-at-monmouth-college.html","abstract":"  DR.

His delicate, densely crosshatched ink drawings, suggestive of 19th-century engravings and ironic story-book texts meld into a singular sensibility: gothic, yes, but without a hint of the genre's hysteria.   In fact, the most disturbing element of Mr. Gorey's work is its cool acceptance of all things horrific. \"With God almighty being flighty and absent frequently,\" as Mr. Gorey writes, these witty novels in miniature tend less to build to climaxes than to trail off into existential ellipses, leaving a final impression of forbidding stillness.

Fox's \"Honor Thy Father and Mother,\" wistfully subtitled \"The True Story of the Menendez Murders,\" is a typical exercise in television docudrama, replete with warnings about composite characters and compressed time sequences. The script is based on public records, meaning the trial itself and newspaper accounts, and on the book \"Blood Brothers,\" by John Johnson and Ronald L. Soble, Los Angeles Times reporters who covered the case. Mr. Soble actually does a cameo bit in the movie.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"SENATOR OUTLINES CHEAPER VERSIONS OF HEALTH PLAN","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/us/senator-outlines-cheaper-versions-of-health-plan.html","abstract":"  Senator George J.

The band, which mixes aboriginal music from Australia with various international pop styles, performs in aboriginal outfits. The band members come out, bodies painted, playing sticks and didgeridoos. They perform a short set of tribal music, unaccompanied. And they do traditional dances. Inadvertently, their shows become a type of ethnic spectacle.   Their music deserves more of a response. The band, from northeastern Australia, has recently released a new album, \"Freedom\" (Hollywood), and can get a real rock momentum going. Its blend, where a didgeridoo, gutturally repeating a few notes, anchors the bottom end of the music and the clanging of hard wooden sticks sifts in and out of bass, guitar and keyboards, offers a beautiful musical vision of cultures in flux.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"Sports of The Times; This Hextall Joins Ranger History Books","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/sports/sports-of-the-times-this-hextall-joins-ranger-history-books.html","abstract":"  HIS family name already resides in the New York Rangers' record book: winning goal in 1940 Stanley Cup final game -- Bryan Hextall Sr.    His grandfather scored the last cup-winning goal in Ranger history.

With a shortage of mail-sorting capacity in the borough, much of the mail for addresses in the Bronx is sorted in Westchester County, Queens and Manhattan.

So when a young director named Nick Gomez recently sought permission to shoot a movie about Newark in the city itself, municipal officialdom winced. Backed by the film maker Spike Lee, Mr. Gomez had written a screenplay, \"New Jersey Drive,\" about the reckless teen-age car bandits who have given the city gobs of unflattering publicity in recent years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"-","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/nyregion/c-corrections-820920.html","abstract":"  A picture caption in some editions Friday with an article about a dispute over the value of Andy Warhol's estate referred incorrectly to \"Shot Red Marilyn,\" the Warhol painting that was shown.
