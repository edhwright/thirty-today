At best, that means continuing the status quo on the school board -- a profound disservice to city schoolchildren.    Ms. Segarra and Dr. Impellizzeri have been in the majority of a divided 4-to-3 board that has been less preoccupied with education than with social issues, like AIDS education and a curriculum that would teach tolerance of homosexuals and different cultural groups.

There are many reasons for this good news: public-service campaigns promoting sensible drinking and designated drivers; major lawsuits that have caused bartenders to think twice about serving intoxicated customers; society's growing distaste for public drunkenness. Yet the deaths of three pedestrians in New York City this spring at the hands of a man with a long history of drunken driving, Abraham Meyers, was a dramatic reminder that we have a long way to go.    The killings provoked justifiable, widespread outrage over lax laws and meager enforcement. Yet few mentioned that the accident might have been averted through simple technology. In a few feet, a car can transform a driver's failings -- drunkenness, anger, momentary inattention -- into a body count. Since cars are essential to everyday life, they cannot be banned, but they can be engineered to keep drunks from getting behind the wheel.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Veto Delayed By Giuliani On Job Shift","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/nyregion/veto-delayed-by-giuliani-on-job-shift.html","abstract":"  Mayor Rudolph W.

Both premieres stuck close to the project's ground rules. The reference point of the choreography was ballet's classical idiom, not modern dance. And budget considerations excluded extravagant costumes and sets. But as usual, Holly Hynes did wonders with her variations on leotards and tunics, and Mark Stanley excelled again with ingenious lighting that provided a fresh theatrical context at the New York State Theater for each work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Salvador Rightist Inaugurated, Pledging to Fulfill Treaty","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/world/salvador-rightist-inaugurated-pledging-to-fulfill-treaty.html","abstract":"  Armando Calderon Sol took office as President today, leading a right-wing Government that has pledged to complete the political changes promised to end the 10-year civil war.

Though the budget fight is now the second longest in more than a decade, it is unclear what impact the delay has had on cities, towns and school districts that depend on state aid. Thanks to $5.5 billion in emergency appropriations from the Legislature over the last two weeks, there has apparently been little borrowing and few layoffs or delays in public projects or in meeting payrolls.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Germany Opts to Redo Old Ministries in Berlin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/world/germany-opts-to-redo-old-ministries-in-berlin.html","abstract":"  Criticized for trying to upholster its long-delayed move to the national capital in Berlin, the German Government said today it had decided to save $600 million by moving into spartan, existing buildings rather than try to complete comfortable new ones by the target date, the year 2000.   The Berlin city government has been pleading with the German federal Government to get the move underway before foreign investors and swarms of lobbyists who have already bought up prime real estate around Berlin give up and leave. For a long time, Chancellor Helmut Kohl seemed the main obstacle to an expedited move, saying he didn't want to work out of an improvised office.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Settlement for Cabby Shot by Policeman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/nyregion/settlement-for-cabby-shot-by-policeman.html","abstract":"  A Haitian cabdriver who was shot by a New York City police officer two years ago, even though he had his hands up, won $1.5 million from the city and $5,000 from the officer in a settlement approved yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.

Common sense, and the wise counsel of political figures as diverse as former Mayor Edward Koch and the City Council member Ronnie Eldridge say that $100 million is too low a price for half the Coliseum site that was once going to bring $338 million. Deputy Mayor John Dyson's plan to keep Mr. Zuckerman's cost to $80 million by having the city contribute $20 million is simply unconscionable and undermines Mr. Dyson as a trustworthy steward of public money.   Mr. Giuliani does not have to tie himself to Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Dyson. As of last night, Mr. Zuckerman had not formally accepted the offer. Mr. Giuliani is not one to accept advice when he has gotten the bit in his teeth. But he would be smart to snatch the paper back before Mr. Zuckerman can sign it. Otherwise, this deal will go into the history books as a signal error of Mr. Giuliani's first year and one that will permanently damage his reputation for judgment and probity.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940602","headline":"Rockets Go On Retreat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/02/sports/pro-basketball-rockets-go-on-retreat.html","abstract":"  The Rockets head south to Galveston Thursday morning.
