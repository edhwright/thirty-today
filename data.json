But Jellybean Benitez, best known for his production work with Madonna, Sting, Whitney Houston and such Latin artists as Ruben Blades and Marc Anthony, decided to take his new Latin music record label elsewhere. He went to Wall Street, and after some 18 months of negotiating and planning, he has found a backer: Wasserstein Perella, a leading international investment bank. In addition to forming an independent record label that will release pop music by bilingual Latin artists, Mr. Benitez and Wasserstein Perella have formed JB Music Publishing to acquire the rights to music by new and old artists in all genres.   Besides the fact that few record labels have ever found a sponsor on Wall Street, this deal, which industry sources say is in the $15 million range, is unusual for another reason. It shows just how much faith big business has in the exploding Latin music market. Sales of Latin music have nearly doubled since 1990. The pop audience for Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada continues to grow, and the new album by the Mexican singer Luis Miguel entered the pop album charts at No. 29 in August, the best debut ever for a Spanish-language album. And there's still room for sales to grow. Though 10 percent of this country's population is Hispanic, Latin music makes up only 2 percent of domestic record sales.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941201","headline":"It's the End of the Riff for Wynton Marsalis's Septet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/01/arts/it-s-the-end-of-the-riff-for-wynton-marsalis-s-septet.html","abstract":"  Wynton Marsalis made news in his first set on Tuesday night at the Village Vanguard.

But the police said today he did it without a degree or license to practice dentistry.   \"He provided a full range of dental services, everything from new bridges and crowns to root canal,\" said Detective Lieut. Gerard Pelkofsky of the Suffolk County police.   Mr. Cordova's illegal practice is an example of an underground network that serves Suffolk's growing population of Central and South American immigrants. It is a network that provides services with no language barriers and no questions about alien status, the police and advocates for Latino immigrants said.   \"Dental and medical care is a big problem for them,\" said Patrick Young, program director for the Central American Refugee Center, an advocacy and service organization in Hempstead. \"They have no idea how things work in this country so they go where their friends go and where people speak their language.\"   Mr. Cordova's illegal practice came to light a week ago when a patient who had had root canal work developed an infection and had to have several teeth extracted by a licensed dentist, the police said.   The patient, a native of El Salvador, complained to the police, who found that Mr. Cordova had attended dental school in El Salvador but had never earned a degree in dentistry and was never granted a license to practice dentistry.   Lieutenant Pelkofsky said detectives raided Mr. Cordova's split-level brick and aluminum-sided home here at 81 Adams Street at 8:50 P.M. on Wednesday and found a complete dental office on the lower floor.   Mr. Cordova, 47, and his wife, Rosa, 42, who worked as his receptionist and dental assistant, were charged with the unlawful practice of dentistry. Both were given desk appearance summonses and are to appear in First District Court in Central Islip on Jan. 17.   Lieutenant Pelkofsky said the Cordovas faced other possible charges, including the violation of environmental laws in disposing of X-ray film and other items, and failure to use procedures necessary to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus.   The police said that Mr. Cordova's father and brothers were all practicing dentists in El Salvador and that his son was a student at the New York University School of Dentistry.   At one time in Central America, it was not uncommon for some dentists to work without formal degrees. Typically, they learned their trade as apprentices to other dentists.   Mr. Cordova had worked as a technician at a dental laboratory on Long Island until two years ago, when he quit to work full time at his growing dental practice, the police said.   The shades were drawn at the Cordova home this afternoon and telephone calls went answered. The mailman made a delivery shortly after noon as two young men, one of whom was described by a neighbor as Mr. Cordova's son, entered the house. Both declined to comment.    Maria Hernandez, who lives around the corner on Jackson Avenue with her sister and brother-in-law -- all Salvadoran immigrants -- said her sister had been a patient of Mr. Cordova's.   \"I can't believe he is not a real dentist,\" Ms. Hernandez said. \"My sister had no problems with him. He and his wife were always very nice to us.\"   Mr. Young of the Central American Refugee Center said that an estimated 85,000 Salvadoran immigrants live on Long Island, of which 35,000 live in Suffolk. The largest concentration, or about 5,000, live in modest single-family homes and apartments in Brentwood, he said.   Most Salvadoran men are legal aliens, he said, while many of the women and children tended to be illegal aliens.   \"Finding good professional health care and legal advice is a difficult problem for Latino immigrants,\" he said. \"There have been many cases involving people who have taken advantage of Salvadorans and their problems with immigration. This case with a dentist points out the need for better educating the Salvadorans about medical services available to them.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"Guilty Verdict For Gunman In Van Attack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/nyregion/guilty-verdict-for-gunman-in-van-attack.html","abstract":"  A Manhattan jury yesterday found a 28-year-old immigrant from Lebanon guilty of murder and attempted murder for firing shot after shot into a vanload of Hasidic students crossing the Brooklyn Bridge last March 1, killing one and injuring three others.

Modern psychiatry might just call it magical thinking: a vision of what the world could be, should be, would be, rather than what it is. Yet an artist like Ferdinand Hodler (1853-1918) had good reason to want the world changed. He was born into poverty, and by the time he was 12, both parents were dead of tuberculosis, a disease that would later kill his brothers and sisters, two of his mistresses and his son.   In one way or another, this traumatic, hammering experience of loss pervades almost every aspect of \"Ferdinand Hodler: Views and Visions\" at the National Academy of Design. The exhibition is the first American overview of this Swiss artist's career in more than 20 years, and even though the large-scale works that made his name are not included, it captures the blend of passion and reserve that defines his work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"Double Lockout: Minors Bolt Door","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/sports/hockey-double-lockout-minors-bolt-door.html","abstract":"  National Hockey League players, locked out for more than two months, have found another door shut.

Not that the word \"chapter\" really describes \"Greek Gold.\" The exhibition is more like a thorough outline, an unusually rich and delightful form of Monarch Notes: one strength is the remarkable degree to which it functions as a microcosm. Its usually tiny works of wearable ancient art echo in miniature many of the themes, motifs and concerns at the heart of classical Greece, including its preoccupation with the human body, its devotion to its all-too-human gods and the perfect pitch with which it distilled its forms and proportions from nature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/nyregion/news-summary-983799.html","abstract":"  International A3-17  ECONOMIST TAKES OVER IN MEXICO  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon took office as President in Mexico, promising a new fight against poverty and sweeping changes in the corrupt justice system.

Ms. Schneider set up a landscape of vague and gauzy colors, and when the tenor saxophonist Bobby LaVell improvised corkscrew phrases, the sound slowly accumulated around him, as if growing upward from his feet. Ms. Schneider is after new sounds, and in the harmonic ambiguity of her material, the tight and dissonant voicings, she made a case for herself as one of the better composers working in the big band idiom.   The rest of the night wandered a bit, with the band suffering from an uncharacteristic lack of energy. Under Jon Faddis's direction, it usually swallows everything it takes on, then smiles happily, but the material seemed to be causing a bit of discomfort.

The fusion resulted in a show that explored the downside of psychedelia. Xanax 25, a New York band that plays every Monday night at the Nightingale bar (213 Second Avenue, at 12th Street, East Village), made angry music inspired more by Altamont than by Woodstock, more by Charles Manson than by Timothy Leary.

She turned nearly upside-down, twisted into a somersault, landed on her feet and, like a seasoned pro, stayed right in character. For the only time in this, the most sentimental of operas, an audible gasp in the audience showed concern about anybody onstage.    That's a shame, because on the surface this production has much to recommend it. It is replacing the shopworn 1958 production that was still in service last season and that has now been donated to the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. There was originally talk of having Franco Zeffirelli create this new \"Butterfly,\" but the assignment went instead to Giancarlo del Monaco, whose brand of realism, evident in two compelling Met productions of \"La Fanciulla del West\" and \"Stiffelio,\" is far more intimate and restrained than what we might have expected from Mr. Zeffirelli.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941203","headline":"Briefcase : Cater Allen Offers New Offshore Funds","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/03/your-money/IHT-briefcase-cater-allen-offers-new-offshore-funds.html","abstract":"The Cater Allen Group, which claims responsibility for assets of more than $15 billion, is launching two new offshore funds with conservative investment strategies which the company says are designed \"to be suitable for first-time investors.\".","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19941203","headline":"Into the Void With Yves Klein","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/03/style/IHT-into-the-void-with-yves-klein.html","abstract":"These two Rhineland cities, traditional rivals in the cultural sweepstakes, have undertaken a unique collaboration.
