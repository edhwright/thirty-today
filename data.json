Then, by running off a classically balanced be-bop line, he would escape.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930624","headline":"Ex-Officers Shot in Queens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/nyregion/ex-officers-shot-in-queens.html","abstract":"  Two retired police officers were shot and wounded in Maspeth, Queens, last night during what appears to have been a robbery by an undetermined number of men, the police said. The incident occurred shortly before 10 P.M., when the two men, who were working for Copstat Security Company, approached a Chemical Bank at 49th Street and Grand Avenue to make a bank drop, said Officer Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman. The two men, who were not immediately identified, were listed in stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital. He said officers were told that a gray van had been seen fleeing the scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930624","time":"1993-06-24

It was not the last time an audience decided James wasn't much of a showman, and he soon returned to what he did best: writing novels and tales of exquisite subtlety. But he always longed for large public acclaim, and finally, curiously, belatedly, James found his mass audience on film.   There is nothing Hollywood would call high-concept in his fiction. His characters' most dramatic moments often exist in what they see or think or sense, or think they possibly might have seen or sensed. Isabel Archer's wedding in \"The Portrait of a Lady\" is an absolute nonevent that takes place between chapters, nothing compared to the quiet moment when she realizes her husband has deceived her. And James's career is filled with heroes whose most energetic action is running from their own emotions. Yet film makers as different as William Wyler, Francois Truffaut, Jacques Rivette and James Ivory have been gloriously inspired by James, in unpredictable ways.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930625","headline":"Reno and F.B.I.

They were one stroke ahead of Jack Nicklaus, who designed the 6,876-yard course, and Jim Colbert. The top of the leader board was a familiar spot for Albus, who stunned the golf world by winning this tournament in 1991 while still working as a club pro at Piping Rock Club in Locust Valley, L.I. (AP) Stadler and Maltbie Fire 65's: Craig Stadler and Roger Maltbie came within a shot of the course record as they shot five-under-par 65's to share the first-round lead in the Canon Greater Hartford Open in Cromwell, Conn. John Huston, Keith Clearwater and Dan Forsman are a shot back and nine players, including Nick Price and Corey Pavin, were at three under. A day after only six players broke par on the TPC at River Highlands course during a celebrity pro-am because of wind gusting to 25 miles an hour. (AP) YACHT RACING  New Winners in Day 4  Shifting winds off the Rhode Island coast yesterday stirred up a new set of winners in the fourth day of Block Island Race Week. Merrythought, the 62-foot sloop owned by Jack King of Annapolis, Md., edged the 50-foot Infinity out of the overall big-boat lead. Sailing aboard Merrythought was Gary Jobson, an America's Cup veteran. Both boats were designed by Bruce Farr of Annapolis, but Merrythought is 10 years older. Racing for the first time this month, Infinity, owned by John Thomson, of Port Washington, L.I., has been the favorite to win its class at Block Island. In another upset, Blue Yankee, a 43-foot sloop owned by Robert Towse, of Stamford, Conn., took over the lead in Class 2 from the 43-foot Barrister III. Eddie-Warden Owen, the top-ranked match-racer from England, sailed on Blue Yankee. BOXING  Knockout for Snipes  Renaldo Snipes, a 36-year-old former heavyweight contender on the comeback trail, made his fourth payday in the last three years pay off last night at the Paramount, where Madison Square Boxing staged its next-to-last program. The 215-pound Snipes raised his career record to 39-7-1 by scoring his 22d knockout, stopping Eddy Curry, a 193-pound cruiserweight, at 2 minutes 16 seconds of the third round. Snipes, a popular local fighter out of Yonkers, is hoping to be invited back to the last Garden-promoted card, scheduled for July 8. He floored Larry Holmes in his only title shot, a World Boxing Council challenge in 1981. But a controversial long count allowed the champion to get up, and then Holmes knocked out Snipes in the 11th round. In last night's featured bout, Lamar Parks, ranked among middlweight contenders by the W.B.C., came back from a first-round knockdown to win a unanimous decision over Danny Garcia of San Juan, P.R.

What it finds is the prevalence of a subtle caste system in which those whose looks come closest to approximating white European standards of attractiveness tend to fare better in American society than those who look more African. It also finds that the tensions generated by this system, which is really an internalized expression of white racism, leave almost everybody feeling insecure.

The package exploded shortly after 8 A.M. at the computer science center at Yale in New Haven. The authorities said they believed it had come from the same person who sent a bomb to a professor at the University of California at San Francisco on Tuesday and who has sent 12 other similar packages since 1978. A Group Called 'FC'    Scores of law-enforcement officials have tried for years to track down the bomber, whom they called Unibom, for University Bomber. The authorities have never been able to establish a motive or precise pattern to the bombings, but officials said yesterday that the bomber's distinct signature was clear from the material used to make the bombs. They also made the connection to the earlier incidents from a letter received yesterday by The New York Times.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930625","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/25/nyregion/metro-digest-269893.html","abstract":"  EMPIRE IS FAULTED IN INQUIRY   United States Senate investigators have determined that the financial problems of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the nation's largest nonprofit health insurer, are largely a result of its own mismanagement.

In songs like \"Peanut Butter Karma\" and a version of Blondie's \"(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear,\" the guitars are layered on thick and cymbals crash calamitously, but the melodies have an airy prettiness.

His literate, well-made tunes are little epiphanies that capture moments of love and longing, and although he's not the most emotive performer in the world, his words often betray more than he's letting on.

Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But if that leader lacks the support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election.

Wind gusting to 20 miles an hour yesterday afternoon kept later starters from making a strong run at Pavin, who completed 36 holes at 132, eight-under for two rounds over the 6,280-yard Tournament Players Club at River Highlands.

(AP) Thunderstorm Halts Senior Players Championship: Jim Colbert and Rocky Thompson were in the clubhouse at 5-under-par 139 when a thunderstorm halted yesterday's second round of the Senior Players Championship in Dearborn, Mich. Thompson shot a one-under 71 and Colbert matched par at 72. An inch of rain fell in an hour on the TPC of Michigan golf course, and two hours later officials decided they couldn't get the bunkers into playable condition in time to complete the second round. Thirty-nine players, half the field, faced a restart early this morning to complete the second round. When the horn sounded to halt play, first-round co-leader Jim Albus was six-under after 13 holes and Bob Charles, the other first-round leader, was four-under after 12 holes.

In New Jersey, Republicans in the State Assembly fancied that a cut in the personal income tax this year would put Gov. Jim Florio on the spot and, of course, enhance their own popularity. But the politically astute Governor has pulled a fast one and also lobbied for a tax cut -- not as big as the G.O.P.'s, but still a cut.   A scorecard may help here: Governor Florio, a Democrat, is seeking a second term. But the huge tax increase he pushed through the then-Democratic Legislature three years ago was so unpopular that a year later the Republicans won veto-proof majorities in both houses. Thus chastened, Mr. Florio is unlikely to force another showdown on taxes anytime soon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930626","headline":"The Nomads of Albany","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/opinion/the-nomads-of-albany.html","abstract":"  Talk about party animals.

Ms. Rimland, a 45-year-old matrimonial lawyer, took her own life and that of her daughter around midnight on June 15 by running the car engine inside her garage after looping a rubber hose from the tailpipe into the car window. In a note she left behind she said she could no longer abide her husband's sexual abuse of her daughter, even though a court had found no substance to that charge.  Groping for Answers    Ms. Rimland's awful act has left those who knew her groping for an explanation. Her husband's friends paint her as an unstable, ruthless woman who would stop at nothing to keep him from their daughter.  But her many champions describe her as a loving mother who despaired of any other means of protecting her child.    The mother was buried by a Reform rabbi under a searing sun in a cemetery in Elmont, L.I. Her two children from an earlier marriage, Jason Rimland, 23, and Marisa Rimland, 19, leaned against each other sobbing inconsolably. An outpouring of mourners proclaimed her death another injustice of a family court system that had permitted the father, Arie Adler, to resume unsupervised visits.    Abigail, a bubbly girl who loved to sing and dance to Disney songs, was laid to rest after sundown in a small cemetery in Monsey, N.Y., that belongs to the largely Hasidic community to which her father had begun to cleave. Car headlights had to illuminate the grave so that mourners could aim their fistfuls of dirt. Jason and Marisa were there, even though Mr. Adler had won the battle to bury Abigail in a cemetery of his choosing.   The separate funerals were the culmination of a two-year custody fight that has not died even with Abigail's death. It shows how fierce and irrational battles over children can get, and how difficult it is for Family Courts to sort out the truth.   The case has galvanized several groups that feel Family Court judges are biased against women, insensitive to sexual abuse and overly secretive and insular. However, the father's defenders see it as another example of a national hysteria over child abuse that has led to fabrication of destructive charges in a blind fury over other grievances.    But overriding any ideological issues were the consuming passions of the parents, whose bitterness lives on in their survivors. Jason and Marisa originally wanted their mother and half sister cremated, but the Orthodox community, which opposes cremation, sent a Hatzolah ambulance worker to the coroner's officer to safeguard Abigail's body. Jason and Marisa have already cleaned out Abigail's toys and dolls from her room in a large ranch house here to keep them from the father.   \"The family doesn't let the living live in peace and it doesn't let the dead die in peace,\" said Anne Selinger, who put Mr. Adler up in her family's home. Extreme Visions    The story of Abigail's parents, like that of many custody fights, is woven of extreme visions. Her family and supporters see Marcia Rimland as a strong, devoted mother who snuffed out her daughter's life when she felt she had no other way to protect her. As a lawyer, Marisa said, her mother knew that appealing the Family Court decision could take a year, during which visits she considered inadequately supervised would continue.   \"She would rather Abigail not be there than to have Abigail hurt,\" Marisa said. \"She loved her more than life.\"   \"She felt cornered,\" said her sister-in-law, Deanna Rimland. \"She felt she had no more options.\"    But Mrs. Selinger and leaders of the Orthodox community around Monsey see her as an unstable, calculating and litigious woman who was so obsessed with excluding her husband that she was willing to brainwash Abigail into believing she was being molested.    According to Mrs. Selinger, Ms. Rimland had always kept her children apart from her estranged husbands. For many years, Mrs. Selinger said, Ms. Rimland had influenced Marisa and Jason to shun their father, Leonard Cohen, who died in January. Similarly, Ms. Selinger said, she made sure Arie Adler would never see Abigail.   \"She couldn't do it through the court system so she did it by taking her life and her daughter's life,\" Mrs. Selinger said.    Views of the 38-year-old Mr. Adler are similarly stark. Mrs. Selinger sees only an affectionate father who tried to protect a daughter who cherished him against a ruthless wife. But the Rimland supporters condemn him as a cold, selfish man who inspired tantrums of fear in his helpless daughter and took advantage of her.   Mr. Adler's lawyer, Howard M. Gurock, denies that his client ever abused Abigail and accuses the mothert of brainwashing the child into making the charges.    The final act was played out swiftly. On June 14, Judge William P. Warren of Family Court in Rockland ruled that the preponderance of evidence did not indicate that Mr. Adler had abused his daughter. A court-appointed social worker had testified that Abigail's \"presentation is entirely consistent with that of a sexually abused child.\" But other witnesses found significant inconsistencies, and Mr. Adler's Lubavitcher hosts, Mrs. Selinger and her husband, Craig, said they had seen only a warm relationship whenever father and daughter stayed over.   The judge, concluding that the tales of abuse were the result of prompting by the mother, ordered a resumption of unsupervised visits in two days. Desperate, Ms. Adler drove to the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on Tuesday and won what some felt was a concession. The Selingers would supervise the visits. But Ms. Rimland felt that the Selingers were too close to her estranged husband.   That night she wrote a note to her older children on a piece of memo paper and led her daughter to her red Toyota.   \"You are my children and I love you more than myself,\" said the note that Jason found in the car. \"Abigail is also my child. I cannot knowingly allow her to be sexually abused. I have no choice. I hope you understand. Be kind to each other. I'm sorry I have to leave you alone. Love forever. Mom.\" Met Six Years Ago    Marcia and Arie met at a party six years ago. He was a broad-shouldered Israeli immigrant with gold-rimmed glasses who was studying electrical engineering. She was a small, slender woman with intense eyes who had been raised as a furrier's daughter in the Bronx. She had two teen-age children from an unhappy first marriage and was fashioning a career as a lawyer.   They married in September 1988, but quarreled regularly, particularly with the arrival of Abigail on June 3, 1989. Their disputes turned so violent that the police were called more than half a dozen times. By August 1991, Mr. Adler moved out, eventually living as a boarder in Hasidic homes, and Ms. Rimland sued for divorce.   One issue dividing them was Abigail's religious upbringing. Ms. Rimland disregarded most Jewish observance, but Mr. Adler, who once had been willing to work on Yom Kippur, began following the Orthodox path of colleagues at International Business Machines who gave him rides to work, though he did not adhere to any particular sect.    He wanted his daughter, who called him Abba, the Hebrew word for father, to eat kosher food and he forbade any phone calls on the Sabbath.   \"He fills her head with Chasidic dogma,\" Ms. Rimland wrote in one of several briefs she filed as her own lawyer. Sole Custody to the Mother    Judge Warren awarded Ms. Rimland sole custody in April 1992. He did not give credence to Ms. Rimland's warnings that Mr. Adler was planning to abduct Abigail to Israel and he permitted Abigail to stay with Mr. Adler every other weekend. Mr. Adler never fled to Israel, but he did fail to make support payments and was jailed for 31 days last year.    Mrs. Selinger blamed his incarceration on Ms. Rimland's excessive demands for money, which, she said, had impoverished Mr. Adler.   In September 1992, Ms. Rimland filed a brief that described what she charged was a pattern of sexual abuse. She said she began to notice that her daughter became hysterical whenever she was dropped off for an overnight visit.    \"She would scream and hold on to me so tight that I literally would have to pry her arms and legs from me,\" Mr. Rimland wrote, adding that she always encouraged Abigail to go with her father.   She said she also noticed that her daughter's toilet training began to regress and that she often masturbated. Ms. Rimland called this to the attention of officials at the county's Child Protection Services, who wondered whether Abigail was being abused.    That was the first time she suspected that possibility, Ms. Rimland said. So she asked Abigail what her father wore when she slept over. She said Abigail told her he wore nothing but an undershirt and repeatedly touched her genital area.   About the same time last summer, Cherri Varvaro, who ran a home day care center that Abigail attended, took a workshop on abused children and decided that Abigail exhibited the classic behaviors of abuse. She asked Abigail and was told that her father sometimes \"tickled\" her genitals.    Ms. Varvaro alerted Ms. Rimland and Child Protection Services in August. Their complaints led to an investigation by the County Attorney.  During the nine months until his decision, the judge insisted that Abigail's visits with Mr. Adler be supervised.   The judge appointed Dr. Virginia C. Strand, a clinical social worker, to interview Abigail and decide whether abuse had occurred. Dr. Strand reported in November that Abigail \"demonstrated a hypervigilant attitude commonly seen in abused children and/or children who witness domestic violence.\" She said Abigail, with no coaxing, volunteered that her father had penetrated her with his fingers and penis.   But Judge Warren, who has been on the bench five years, said in an interview that he discounted much of Dr. Strand's report because \"Strand never considered the possibility of prompting by the mother.\" Indeed, he said, one of several social workers monitoring the case had asked Abigail whether anyone had told her to say such things about her father and Abigail had replied, \"Mommy told me to say this.\"    \"I did not find the mother credible,\" Judge Warren said.    More convincing to Judge Warren was Mrs. Selinger, the mother of four young daughters and a son, who testified in hearings in February and March that Abigail and Mr. Adler slept in separate beds in a basement playroom and that she saw only affectionate relations. It was the mother whom Abigail did not want to see, Mrs. Selinger testified, describing how Abigail became hysterical when Ms. Rimland phoned.   \"Do you think I as a mother with small children would allow something like this to happen in my house?\" Mrs. Selinger said of the abuse charges.    By the time of the hearings, the custody cases had so consumed Ms. Rimland and Mr. Adler that both lost their jobs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930626","headline":"Bosnian Leader Resists Pressure to Negotiate on Partition Plan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/26/world/bosnian-leader-resists-pressure-to-negotiate-on-partition-plan.html","abstract":"  The Serbian-Croatian proposal to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina into three loosely confederated ethnic states continued to be opposed by Bosnia's President today as he faced diplomatic pressure to join seven other members of the collective Bosnian leadership when peace talks resume here next week.
