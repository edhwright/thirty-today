At a modest cost to the taxpayers, $167 million this year, it has helped channel private donations to an impressive variety of nonprofit arts institutions across the country. Institutions report that each dollar granted by the Endowment generates an average of $11 in matching private funds. As a result, many more Americans have been able to experience original art firsthand, and talented artists have been encouraged to pursue their work.    This is just what the Endowment was created to do. But now, for a variety of reasons, some conservative Republicans want to use their new Congressional majorities to cut off funds for the Endowment and shut it down.

Reared in Harlem during its cultural flowering and trained in art, Mr. Lawrence had by the age of 20 evolved a slightly archaic, Cubist-inflected style that held abstraction and representation in perfect balance. By 1940, when he turned 23, he had already executed three cycles of small tempera paintings, each numbering around 30 works, which chronicled the lives of Toussaint L'Ouverture, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.    Mr. Lawrence's activities did not go unnoticed: his work was exhibited not only in group shows but also in two solo shows, and he received a Rosenwald Fund fellowship. With this support, he waded into his fourth and longest cycle early in 1940, executing \"The Migration Series,\" whose 60 captioned images have been reunited for the first time in 20 years in a compelling exhibition that has just arrived at the Museum of Modern Art. A bittersweet saga whose mixture of words and images has a circling, fuguelike rhythm, \"The Migration Series\" is Mr. Lawrence's greatest achievement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950113","headline":"On Stage, and Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/13/theater/on-stage-and-off.html","abstract":"  Fugard, After Apartheid    The McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., has announced that Brian Friel's play \"Wonderful Tennessee,\" which did not work on Broadway in 1993, will replace the intended end of its season: the world premiere of a new work by the South African playwright Athol Fugard, the author of \"Master Harold . . . and the Boys\" and \"A Lesson From Aloes.\"   Mr. Fugard, reached at his home in Durban, said the play was not ready yet and in any case, the McCarter was to get only the American premiere, after which he hopes to bring it to New York in cooperation with the Manhattan Theater Club.

After 10 years of honoring rock's pioneers and innovators with a night of improvised jams, confessional speeches and other surprises, it is turning into a ritual that one day may be as formal, as rigid and as respected as the Grammys. The fact that in September a giant shrine of steel and glass called the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is to open in Cleveland will add more prestige and convention to the ceremony, which is scheduled to move from New York to Cleveland in 1997.   While an annual event like this is a positive achievement for rock-and-roll, it's important that the Hall of Fame's big night not lose the spontaneity and energy that defines the music it celebrates. In ceremonies past, the speeches were followed by jam sessions where anything could happen, and usually did. This year, perhaps because highlights of the event were being taped for an MTV special, the performances seemed planned and contrived, with long, momentum-killing pauses between each.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"Welfare Overhaul Chorus Begins on a Cautious Note","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/us/welfare-overhaul-chorus-begins-on-a-cautious-note.html","abstract":"  Members of Congress from both parties promised today to give states much more control over a wide range of welfare programs.

If privatization means bringing in private management to do a better job, it is worth exploring. But outright sale would be foolish. Responsible officials need firm control over facilities that are central to the area's role as a hub of national and international commerce and travel.   The question comes up because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governors George Pataki and Christine Todd Whitman, all Republicans, are bent on having private interests take over public services wherever possible, and are all strapped for cash.  The Mayor and the Governors have separate official interests. The cities of New York and Newark own the airport land. The Governors, watched over by Port Authority bondholders, jointly control the Authority and thus the airport management. But overriding their parochial perspectives, all three should have one paramount concern -- the quality and capacity of these facilities. Ranked among the world's principal airports, they are and will continue to be key to the region's growth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/nyregion/news-summary-702995.html","abstract":"  International 3-6  CLINTON CHIDES RUSSIA ON ATTACK    President Clinton broke his silence about the Russian attack on a secessionist region, urging that the military action be halted but saying that aid to Russia should not be cut back because of the crisis. 1","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"Japanese Tire Maker Clashes With Labor Chief Over Strike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/us/japanese-tire-maker-clashes-with-labor-chief-over-strike.html","abstract":"  Over the past week, the head of the American operations of the giant Bridgestone Corporation of Japan has rebuffed repeated appeals from Labor Secretary Robert B.

Or at one of its other original performances, in an old limestone quarry with its \"lovely dripping water sounds and Valhalla-like mists\" or at a lava cave in the Canary Islands. Because this New Age-ish Minimalist performance group is actually part of the aging countercultural avant-garde, in which the point is to displace the world of artifice and return the listener to a state of nature in which sound is unmediated sensation rather than learned art.    That was why Pauline Oliveros was playing a just-tuned accordion and David Gamper a just-tuned piano: so that overtones of each note would coincide precisely with the pitches of other notes being played, creating uncanny resonances like those created in cisterns and caves. That was why conch shells were used as horns: to invoke the ritualistic, preindustrial musical universe. And that was why Stuart Dempster walked onto the darkened performance space trumpeting a didjeridu, a long tubular Australian folk instrument that created waves of upper register overtones over a bass drone: to invoke non-Western instrumentation and exotic, unfamiliar customs of listening.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"The Loser?Auction House Estimates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/style/IHT-the-loserauction-house-estimates.html","abstract":"It all looked like the end of an era, with dealers finally succumbing to the victorious onslaught of the auction houses.

The ruling, handed down on Tuesday by Justice Kristin Booth Glen of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, could delay for years some elements of the waterfront plan, which is being formulated jointly by city and state officials, because it means that community groups from the top to the bottom of the 4.5-mile stretch of riverfront can challenge the waterfront plan on environmental grounds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950114","headline":"A New Storm Unloads Rain on California","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/us/a-new-storm-unloads-rain-on-california.html","abstract":"  A new storm front rolled in off the Pacific today and began giving California yet another drenching.

The Good Weather Insurance Agency in Salem, Mass., handled two of the three Connecticut contracts for Reliance National Insurance. Each policy is different, but they all require at least two or three storms before they kick in. East Hartford needs three storms with at least three inches of snow.

The city early on adopted jazz as a spiritual cause, and it was manifested in French films -- the soundtrack for Louis Malle's \"Ascenseur Pour l'Echafaud,\" with its chillingly moody music by Miles Davis, or Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless,\" with music by Martial Solal. Though American jazz musicians moved to Paris early on, and were performing there by 1919, it was after World War II that jazz blended with existentialism and was imported to the United States through film with a European beat sophistication.   But the bohemian vision created by the movies isn't quite right any more, as jazz has blended as easily with bourgeois society as it did with beat culture. In Paris, jazz is all over the city, and its audience isn't enveloped in a romantic Gauloise haze. Parisians still get nostalgic about the golden age, but their city today has an astounding variety and richness to its music. Jazz has become part of the city's consciousness in a way that challenges even New York. People go out, and they go out to relax, and listen. If you want to hear music on Saturday night (weeknights are less crowded), better reserve early. And plan to stay out late.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"Babylon Designates Garbage-Carting Consortium","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/nyregion/babylon-designates-garbagecarting-consortium.html","abstract":"AFTER 26 years in the carting business Joseph A.

To Jan. 29. 463-5672. \n\nAs more recognition is given to the spiritual content in midcentury American abstraction, Mark Tobey's substantial reputation becomes even more significant. This small exhibition of 15 prints from the Hofstra Museum collection, all executed in the two years before the artist's death in 1976 at age 86, is valuable as a review of Tobey's achievements and as a demonstration of the range of motifs he explored with the calligraphy-inspired thin marks that are usually termed his \"white writing.\" Frequently reproduced examples from museum collections tend to narrow public conceptions of his imagery, which is unfortunate. This show and a recent exhibition at the Yoshii Gallery in Manhattan suggest the wide scope of his themes and pictorial ideas.\n\nTobey's luminous marks sometimes rush over the entire surface and sometimes are made to seem compressed. Space can be intentionally ambiguous when it is perceived under layers of tangled lines, or it can add pressure when it surrounds a weblike mass.

In \"Patterns and Poetry: No Robes From the Lucy Truman Aldrich Collection\" (through next Sunday), Susan Hay, curator of costume and textiles, sought to make a virtue of limited gallery space by using a compact design that would show the costumes in a dramatic context. Though the original proposals called for concrete structures, David Harvey, the exhibition designer, credits budgetary constraints with forcing an appropriate solution -- the illusion of an architectural setting, in this case a 16th-century No stage at the Nishi Honganji Temple in Kyoto, Japan. In so doing he followed the Japanese principle that finds beauty in the absence or elimination of everything unnecessary. Unlike the designs of museum mega-shows that depend on quantity and showmanship, Mr. Harvey's suggestion of architecture enhances an exhibition devoted to a theater of allusion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/nyregion/c-corrections-933195.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a picture caption on page 1 of the Arts and Leisure section today about UPN, a new television network that will begin broadcasting tomorrow night, renders the full name incorrectly.

No master of the written word, Mr. Schulke is instead an insightful photographer whose shots transcend his sometimes sentimental and awkward prose. Mr. Schulke, a veteran photojournalist, makes the atmosphere -- the despair and the exhilaration -- palpable in his images, which begin with King's funeral in 1968, then backtrack to the 1963 funeral of Medgar Evers, whose death, Mr. Schulke writes, was \"the first murder of a black civil rights leader the media had paid any attention to.\" The iconography of the civil rights movement is hauntingly familiar: beefy, helmeted police officers and sheriffs' deputies, nightsticks at the ready, lips tight and implacable; demonstrators, black and white, seemingly fixed in time and place by their dedication to the cause of equal rights. Mr. Schulke frequently compromised his credentials as an impartial observer; even King once rebuked him with the warning, \"You have to stay back and not listen to your guts.\" His dislike of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace became so intense, Mr. Schulke writes, that he felt compelled to turn down magazine assignments about him. His pictures of Federal marshals, armed segregationists and protesters illustrate his recollections of tear gas, Molotov cocktails and sniper bullets. This is the third book Mr. Schulke has produced about King, with whom his relationship sounds intimate and genuine. \"He'd give you a hug,\" Mr. Schulke writes, \"and you would die for the man.\" LYNN KARPEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950115","headline":"What's Up -- and What's Going Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/realestate/what-s-up-and-what-s-going-up.html","abstract":"  A YEAR ago, Costas Kondylis, one of the city's most employed, most pragmatic apartment tower architects, had 13 people working for him.

This was true of matters as weighty as accepting a contract for an opera and as slight as permitting the transposition of an aria, or even sending a list of his decorations and honors to the Italian senate.   So when Giulio Ricordi, the scion of the house that published Verdi's operas, set about persuading Verdi to touch up \"Simon Boccanegra,\" an 1857 score that was not getting performed and therefore not bringing in any royalties, he may not have been totally discouraged to receive the following communication: \"I received yesterday a large parcel which I suppose to be a score of 'Simone.'

His tempos and dynamics were more fluid than Szell's, and the orchestra's sound was sometimes better focused and more thrilling.

The stars were a pair of well-established dancers, the regal El Camborio and his fiery partner, Lucia Real. They clattered across the floor loudly and rhythmically, their hips and torsos swaying and shaking in creative combinations of classic flamenco moves. Like all outstanding flamenco artists, they kept their arms, hands and fingers in ceaseless, evocative motion. This aspect of flamenco is perhaps the most direct evidence of its roots in southern Asia, the original home of the Gypsies who developed it.    Modeled after the 16th-century popular theaters known as corrales de comedias, Corral de la Moreria is musty with tradition. A full menu is available, but most patrons around me made do with glasses of red wine, counting on the show to provide the evening's sensory delights. They were not disappointed. The dancers overflowed with emotion, and they were expertly accompanied by stylized guitar music and jaleo, the clapping and calling that is integral to the performance. The jaleadores achieved a perfect balance between spontaneity and restraint, keeping rhythm while adding a rustic element that recalls flamenco's rural origins. Theirs is a practiced art, and a patron would no more join in the clapping than he would bring a toy banjo and strum along with the guitarists.   Flashy and colorful, wild but also highly ritualized, flamenco dancing has become an instantly recognized symbol of Spanish culture. Its rich history reflects that of Andalusia, the sunny and fertile region of southern Spain where it was born. It shows influences from the Islamic and Jewish cultures that once flourished in the region, and even from Roman dances, which arrived 20 centuries ago. But it was the Gypsies who were to flamenco \"like rice to paella,\" in the words of the historian Fernando Quinones, \"the unifying and fundamental element.\"    Flamenco has become an international art form, with schools all over the world, including several hundred in Japan. Less overtly erotic than other Latin forms, like the tango and the samba, still it is nothing if not sensual. According to Andalusian tradition, the best dancers are not young or conventionally attractive, but mature and heavy-set, their legs thick and muscular from years of practice.   Foreign interest in flamenco began as part of the wave of fascination with Spain kindled by the Romantic movement, and attracted artists ranging from Gustave Dore to Rimsky-Korsakov to Washington Irving. They and other early tourists in Spain often sought to visit academies where flamenco was taught, and in response to their interest, \"cafes cantantes\" opened in many Andalusian towns. It was their successors that I wanted to find.   My appetite whetted in Madrid, with three companions I set out for Seville, home port of conquistadors and Andalusia's largest and most important city. We traveled aboard the high-speed train that was built to serve visitors to the 1992 world exposition there. The trip, which only four years ago lasted the better part of a day, now takes just two and a half hours. The ride was smooth and the airline-style service courteously efficient as we sped southward.   Romances between dancers and bullfighters are the stuff of countless legends and stories still told in Andalusia, so it was fitting that both of the flamenco bars we visited in Seville were in the shadow of the famous Maestranza bullring. The shows reflected very different aspects of flamenco's modern face.   El Patio Sevillano is a large room decorated in Andalusian patio style, with ceramic tiles and engravings of the city. Patrons are often packed close together, although on the night we visited the place was not crowded. We sat by the side of the stage, near an elegant Spanish gentleman, clearly an enthusiast, who called out encouragement to the dancers at the right moments.   The show was centered on but not limited to classical flamenco. Some of the numbers were closer to ballet; others resembled popular dance. One was even performed to the recorded strains of the overture from \"Carmen,\" which outsiders often take to be the quintessential Andalusian anthem but which was in fact composed by Georges Bizet, who was French, and has little if anything to do with flamenco.   The troupe at El Patio Sevillano totaled 14 dancers, guitarists and jaleadores. As soon as one number was over, the dancers rushed upstairs to change into new costumes while others took the stage. This was a highly polished show, ready to be lifted intact by some ambitious promoter who wanted to introduce Spanish dancing abroad. Purists might scorn some parts of it, but the per formers were accomplished professionals. The jaleadores added an air of authenticity to a show that was aimed mainly at tourists.   The next night we visited a smaller tavern, El Arenal. Housed in a 17th-century building on a small, hard-to-find alley, its walls are covered with drawings of flamenco dancers and scenes of senoritas flirting with bullfighters. While the show was not as seamlessly choreographed as others we had seen, it was probably the most authentic we saw in Spain. The dancers performed with unbridled emotion, seemingly heedless of the audience. \"This time I feel like I'm sitting around a Gypsy campfire,\" one of my companions said as we sipped our sangria.   We were disappointed to find no flamenco being performed in Cordoba during our visit, and traveled with high hopes from there to our final stop, Granada. Home to the legendary Alhambra, the Moorish castle that is the most popular tourist attraction in Spain, Granada is always packed with tourists, and flamenco shows are part of the standard fare.   Following the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel, we chose a place called Jardines de Neptuno. We should have balked when the concierge told us that a bus would pick us up at the hotel. We began to worry when the bus stopped at several other hotels, filled up with tourists, and then parked at our destination behind two other full-sized buses. Inside, the showplace was a three-sided arena with sloping rows like those at a sports stadium, and seats for 800 patrons. As far as we could tell, there was not a single Spaniard in the house, and understandably so. The show was painfully commercial, a virtually unrecognizable mixture of flamenco, salsa and various other Latin styles.   Most of the performers at Jardines de Neptuno were Hollywood-pretty, but the choreographers were evidently unconcerned with authenticity. The spectators didn't seem to mind. They chattered loudly in English and German, and one man in the front row clapped incessantly along with the jaleadores as if he were at a sing-along festival. We confronted the concierge later, and he replied with a philosophical shrug. \"If flamenco is alive today,\" he said, \"it is because of tourists.\"   In 1922, the composer Manuel de Falla and the poet Federico Garcia Lorca, among others, organized a flamenco festival in Granada to revive its classical roots. Aficionados in the city this year for the weeklong Flamenco Encounter in Granada (to be held in either June or October) or in Cordoba for the Flamenco-Guitar Festival (two weeks in July, still to be designated) can follow suit by immersing themselves in the art of flamenco. Those in Seville may catch sight of the filming, beginning next week, of \"Flamenco,\" a movie by Carlos Saura. \"Other forms of popular music come and go,\" he said, \"but flamenco is constantly renewing itself. This is an especially good moment -- lots of exciting new performers.\" WHERE TO GO TO WATCH THE DANCERS    For information about flamenco festivals, write to the National Tourist Office of Spain, 665 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022.

Hotels and cultural sites on the island off the east coast of Africa had fallen into disrepair owing to government neglect. But in the last few years, the Government (Zanzibar and Tanganyika united in 1964 to become Tanzania) has encouraged tourism investment, and improved facilities have begun drawing travelers, many of them adding stops on Zanzibar to longer East Africa tours. One of the island's chief attractions is the Stone Town section of the city of Zanzibar, with its narrow, winding streets and balconied limestone houses with ornately carved doors. Visitors also may tour farms where clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom are grown, or swim at Indian Ocean beaches.    One company that operates East African tours, Wildlife Safari, offers a two-night stay on Zanzibar before any of its trips. Participants stay in the Dhow Palace, a Stone Town house converted to a 10-room hotel.  The cost of $295 a person, based on two in a room, includes breakfast and sightseeing.  Travel to Zanzibar is usually by a flight from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian coast, followed by a 22-mile hydrofoil ride. Round-trip fare is $300, according to the company.
