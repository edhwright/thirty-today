But for 58-year-old HANK DEKKER, blind since 1977, it is the next step in a series of long-distance voyages. Having sailed for the first time 13 years ago, Dekker has crossed the Pacific Ocean alone twice.   Dekker plans to set out today in a 30-foot sailboat from Cape May, N.J., for a 3,000-mile solo voyage to Plymouth, England. He will navigate with the help of a Braille compass and charts, and with the aid of voice-synthesized readouts from radar and a satellite tracking device, the Global Postioning System.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"No Change of Heart : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/opinion/IHT-no-change-of-heart-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"Mideast: All Stand to Gain\" (Opinion, June 14): .Shibley Telhami lists Libya's authorized pilgrimage by private citizens to Jerusalem as a symptom of improvement.

Or, actually, an old one. When the company revives its 1967 Frank Corsaro production tomorrow evening, it will not present the well-worn standard edition. Instead, Christopher Keene will conduct the American premiere of the score as it was performed at its world premiere at La Scala.    That version had only a single performance, on Feb. 17, 1904, and was booed off the stage for a complicated combination of reasons. The audience found its Wagnerian-length acts too long, and objected to the absence of a tenor aria. Some listeners derided the Japanese folk elements, and criticized other sections of the work as warmed-over \"La Boheme.\" And some objected to the brutality and outright nastiness with which Puccini and his librettists, Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica, described this tragic meeting of East and West.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Questions On Signing Up New Voters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/nyregion/questions-on-signing-up-new-voters.html","abstract":"  In an often partisan hearing, State Senate Republicans yesterday sharply questioned the credibility of a former New York City Board of Elections official who now works for Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign and raised concerns about whether duplicate registrations and other irregularities could skew a close race this fall.   At the hearing at the State Office Building in lower Manhattan, Board of Elections officials acknowledged that they had found as many as 22,000 duplicate registrations on file in the city between the time of the Presidential election last fall and this spring, but they said that a random check of 180 of them had found no evidence that any of those registrants had voted twice. They said they were weeding out the duplicates from the three million voters on the rolls. Duplicate Registrations    For years the board has been plagued by administrative problems, and Senator Michael F. Nozzolio of Seneca Falls, the chairman of the Senate's Elections Committee, called the hearing to examine recent reports of sloppy record-keeping and potential irregularities, especially in the wake of big voter registration drives last year. Aides to the Republican-Liberal mayoral nominee, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who lost in 1989 by less than 50,000 votes, have repeatedly claimed there is potential for outright fraud, arguing that duplicate registrations, particularly in heavily black districts, could hurt their candidate this fall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"Hentrich: Punt, Pray And Kick","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/sports/pro-football-hentrich-punt-pray-and-kick.html","abstract":"  After a college career at Notre Dame, Craig Hentrich should have no problem punting or kicking before a large crowd and a national television audience. The real question for Hentrich and the Jets is: Can he kick better than the incumbent, Louie Aguiar?   Punters in the National Football League are ranked by the average net distance of the kick (the total distance of the kick minus the return yardage). By that measure, Aguiar ranked third in the American Conference and fifth in the league, with 37.6 yards. Still, there is a perception that Aguiar's job is in jeopardy because of Hentrich's mere presence in camp. Al Roberts, the Jets' special teams coordinator, made it clear today that Hentrich, the team's eighth-round draft pick, was not being handed the job, but that he could kick his way into contention.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930729","headline":"N.F.L.

Simmons will have the surgery today to repair torn cartilage he suffered during Monday morning's workout. A test Tuesday revealed the tear. Simmons was the 15th player selected in the draft and had been slotted to start at left outside linebacker.   \"It'll set him back a little bit, certainly,\" Holmgren said. \"But we're talking four to six weeks and he'll be back in there at the beginning of the season.\"   In Simmons's absence, the Packers will start Jeff Brady, a third-year man. A knee injury limited him to 8 games and 18 tackles last year. (AP) San Francisco 49ers    What is a trip to a foreign land for his teammates is a homecoming of sorts for the San Francisco 49ers' offensive tackle James Parrish.   Parrish, a veteran of the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football and now struggling to win a spot on the 49ers, said he was mobbed by young autograph-seekers during an evening walk on the Ramblas, the city's jammed promenade.   \"It's great, I'm just glad to be back in the city and see some of my old friends,\" Parrish said before the 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers scrimmaged at a practice for their American Bowl game in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday.   \"All the guys on the team know I played here and know the city and the people -- and my Spanish is pretty fluent,\" said Parrish, who played for the Dragons before the W.L.A.F. folded after the 1992 season. Parrish was cut last season by San Diego after he spent the 1991 season on Miami's \"physically unable to perform list.\" (AP) Miami Dolphins    At first it looked as if it were just another scuffle during two-a-day drills in Davie, Fla. Hot, tired and suddenly angry, Huey Richardson reached out and grabbed offensive guard Charles Hope's face mask. Then Richardson ripped it off, and the message was clear -- he'll fight to keep his career alive.   Richardson, a former Florida Gators star, is trying to win a job at defensive end with the Miami Dolphins, his fourth team in three years. He was a bust with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who made him the 15th player selected in the 1991 draft. The Washington Redskins and Jets waived him last year. In two seasons, he made seven tackles.   \"I had the opportunity at those other places; they just didn't pan out,\" said Richardson, 25. \"My dad always told me that adversity builds character, so I guess I'm getting a lot of character.\" (AP) Cincinnati Bengals    David Klingler, Cincinnati's starter in his second pro season, says he isn't worried about Jay Schroeder taking his job. Klingler, last year's first-round draft pick, said he welcomes the experience Schroeder and quarterbacks coach Ken Anderson have to offer.   \"If anything, having Jay there takes off the pressure,\" said Klingler, who has played in four N.F.L. games, compared with 100 for Schroeder. \"With Kenny, now you have two guys back there with a lot to offer.\"   Schroeder, once the starter for Washington and the Los Angeles Raiders, played for the 1987 Super Bowl champion Redskins. He came to the Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, signing a two-year contract for up to $3 million, but was told he would be Klingler's backup.   \"In the back of my mind, I'm thinking I could go 16 weeks and not get a shot,\" Schroeder said. \"But I've got to be prepared. That's the only way I can treat it. I've seen it happen for nine years. It's tough to go through a whole season with one quarterback. I don't think they would have brought me in here if they didn't think I could start.\" (AP) San Diego Chargers    Cornerback Gill Byrd, the San Diego Chargers' career interception leader with 31 over 6 years and the current player with the most time as a Charger, underwent reconstructive surgery on his left knee yesterday and is out for the season.   The team physician, Dr. Gary Losse, repaired two ligaments and a tendon that Byrd, 32, tore when he apparently caught his cleats in the grass and fell during a non-contact, one-on-one drill Tuesday afternoon.   Byrd's loss means the Chargers have to fill both starting cornerback spots. They lost right cornerback Anthony Blaylock to the Chicago Bears via free agency.

It wasn't quite good enough for a new Ferrari. The $140,000 Ferrari Testarossa, the prize for anyone setting a world record in Sestriere, Italy, at Europe's highest track -- 6,000 feet -- went unclaimed yesterday for the fifth consecutive year. Plenty of big names tried, including Sergei Bubka, Kevin Young and Quincy Watts. But it was Jackson who came the closest to winning the car as he won in 12.97 seconds, just 0.05 off the world record of 12.92 set by Roger Kingdom in 1989. Running against a headwind of 1.6 meters a second, the Welshman became only the third man to break the 13-second barrier. He broke his European record of 13.04, set last year in Cologne, Germany. Bubka won the pole vault, clearing 19 feet 1/4 inch. He barely missed at a world-record attempt at 20-1 3/4, hitting the bar with his arms after clearing it with the rest of his body. Young, an American, won the 400 hurdles in 48.20. Watts, another Olympic champion from the United States, won the 400 in 44.13 seconds, the third best time of the year.

But the huge margin of defeat in a district that had been held by the Tories since 1910 was larger than expected and seemed certain to weaken Mr. Major's political standing at a time when members of his own party have begun discussing whether he should be replaced.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930730","headline":"Banska Stiavnica Journal; After the Uncoupling, Slovakia Seems Unnerved","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/30/world/banska-stiavnica-journal-after-the-uncoupling-slovakia-seems-unnerved.html","abstract":"  Alena Daubnerova, whose forebears stretch back generations in this traditional area of strong Slovak nationalism, represents the ambivalent streak of many Slovaks as they confront life in their new country.

A case in point is Moonshake, Matador's newest overseas acquisition. This English quartet runs the gamut, sometimes delivering jazzed-up guitar rock, sometimes veering toward a techno-groove sound. David Callahan, the lead singer and guitarist, sings gutter tales in a startling voice, blending Morrissey's warble and John Lydon's sneer; Margaret Fiedler (who plays synthesizer, guitar and vocals) is cooler, her lyrics more insinuating.

The opening work, in fact, tore through any presumed bond between the composers. Even on its own terms, Beethoven's brooding, introspective String Quartet in F minor (Op. 95) inhabits a world alien to Mozart at his darkest, and is certainly worlds removed from the program's sole Mozart offering, the Piano Concerto No. 21 in C (K. 467).

The city should take two measures promptly.    (1) Lanes should be created to segregate skaters from bicyclers so that both can use the park safely.

But old farm programs rarely die, and the farm lobby seems likely to get this one resurrected when Senate and House conferees work out the final allocation of farm funds for next year. That would be a pity.   As subsidies go, the payout to sheep and goat ranchers is trifling, at $200 million a year. It began as a sop to the ranchers, when President Eisenhower rejected their plea for tariff protection. The nominal justification was \"national security\" -- the need for cloth for military uniforms.

Lewis was third in 10.22 behind another American, Jon Drummond, who led for most of the race before a sellout crowd of 14,797 at the Gateshead International Stadium and finished in 10.12. Christie and Lewis were guaranteed $150,000 apiece. Christie, 33 years old, was faster out of the blocks than Lewis and was a meter clear of his 32-year-old rival at the line after overtaking Drummond in the last 20 meters. Calvin Smith, a former world record-holder, was fourth in 10.33. Lewis said he was affected by a slow start, but Christie said Drummond's stunning speed off the blocks inspired him to victory. It was the first time Lewis and Christie had met since the 1991 world championships final in Tokyo, which Lewis won in a world-record time of 9.86, with Christie fourth in a European-record 9.92. Both marks still stand. Despite Christie's triumph, Lewis holds a 12-2 lead in their head-to-head races.

Korda, the highest seeded player left in the tournament, advanced to a semifinal meeting today with unseeded Mikael Pernfors, who followed his victory over Jim Courier on Thursday with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over No. 8 Aleksandr Volkov. Korda extended his record against Lendl to 5-1. He has known the Czech-born American citizen since childhood, when his father, Petr Korda Sr., worked with Lendl on the Czechoslovak Davis Cup team. \"I don't read his shots well,\" said Lendl, the former No. 1-ranked player who is now ranked seventh. \"He has no backswing, and I have trouble picking up the ball. If he's making his shots, he's hard to play against.\" Also advancing yesterday was unseeded Richey Reneberg, who defeated Brett Steven, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. He will face the winner of the late quarterfinal between Andre Agassi and Todd Martin.

For McGaughey, the turning point came when Lure started training on turf a year ago, at Saratoga. He went on to win five of his next eight races -- all of them on grass and one of them a victory in the Breeders' Cup Mile -- while running second in the three others and running up a bankroll of $1.3 million. And today he returned to Saratoga for the first time since the turning point, and won the $119,400 Daryl's Joy Stakes on the grass with style, command and a relentless rush through the homestretch that buried Fourstardave by three lengths. Star of Cozzene Isn't Here    There was some pressure on Lure to win this one, and not just because he was coming back to Saratoga. The main pressure came from his rival and nemesis, Star of Cozzene. Four times in the last three months, they have dueled in major races; Lure won the first two, Star of Cozzene the next two.

Klaus Barbie's lawyer, Jacques Verges, claimed he could show that France, Israel and other countries had committed crimes equal to those of the Nazis, citing the use of torture by the French in Algeria and Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.   Mr. Verges's revisionism turned out to be a hollow threat, easily discredited. The real threat to our understanding of the Holocaust was the trial of John Demjanjuk, the Nazi collaborator whose conviction the Israeli Supreme Court has overturned. The prosecution built its case around the presumption that a sword- and whip-wielding Ivan of Treblinka was, as the Israeli prosecutor put it, a more \"major\" war criminal than an ordinary death camp
