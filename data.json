Her voice, full of raw-throated emotion and bluesy finesse, helped propel her. But unlike many good-timey singers around the country, Ms. Osborne has more to offer than party anthems. At the Mercury Lounge on Tuesday night, she and a new band previewed her new album, in a set of remarkable songs that contemplate sex and faith, despair and trust, pleasure and loss.   Ms. Osborne's songs carry the essentials of roots rock -- blues riffs, soul vamps, a folky twang -- into a modern urban setting. She has plenty of vocal technique, from Bonnie Raitt's blues turns to Balkan glottal stops, but she uses it to illuminate the songs, not to show off. In \"St. Teresa,\" she had a hoarse, ravaged voice to sing about a drug-addicted prostitute; she was sweetly comforting in \"Crazy Baby,\" pleading with a depressed friend not to commit suicide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Davis Hopes Practice Routines Will Leave Jitters Behind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/sports/figure-skating-davis-hopes-practice-routines-will-leave-jitters-behind.html","abstract":"  His stomach churning triple axels, his confidence spiraling into a death-drop spin, his nerves turning to slush, Scott Davis has resorted to an extreme cure for his stage fright -- virtual reality.

Among the most novel offerings is a festival of Spanish music, including orchestral, chamber and flamenco concerts and preconcert lectures (Feb. 7 to 13, 1996). The series is a tribute to Manuel de Falla on the 50th anniversary of his death. Charles Dutoit is to conduct the orchestral program, which includes music by Falla, Albeniz, Rodrigo and Turina. The festival is to be sponsored by the Sociedad General de Autores de Espana.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Spartan Official Quits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/sports/sports-people-colleges-spartan-official-quits.html","abstract":"  The Michigan State athletic director, MERRILY DEAN BAKER, resigned yesterday with two years left on her contract.

He seems like a natural -- re-elected by a landslide last year in a stunning comeback, firmly identified with several of the issues that have captured the nation's attention and emboldened his party, proud possessor of an efficient fund-raising network and the dominant political figure in a state whose wealth and sheer size give it an ever-more-dominant role in national politics.

The story of that odyssey, from its bitter roots to its profound consequences, was admirably set forth by Nicholas Lemann in his 1991 book, \"The Promised Land.\" Inspired by that work and borrowing its title, the resonant five-hour BBC documentary that begins on Sunday gives some of the people who took part in the greatest peacetime migration in American history an opportunity to tell what it was like.   The opening hour is alive with memories of growing up in sharecropping families in the Mississippi Delta.

Of course the chief blame for this debacle lies with the White House, which once again put forth a nominee without adequately vetting the person's background or knowing the answers to potentially explosive questions. As a result, the Administration put out false information on the number of abortions performed by Dr. Foster. In this as in earlier episodes, White House bungling makes it difficult for President Clinton's natural allies to support him fully.
