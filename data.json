NEW YORK CITY ANGRY SHOUTS FROM STATEN ISLAND The Staten Island secession movement, once dismissed as pointless grousing from a borough angered by its diminished role in city government, has grown in recent years into a powerful shout of resentment and distress that will go to a vote Nov. 2. Even die-hard supporters of secession do not think the proposal would make it through the gantlet in Albany. Yet successful or not, the movement has already sent a disturbing message to City Hall.

New Jersey's largest non-shellfish catch is of Menhaden, a common bait fish, at more than 27 million pounds in 1992. In contrast, the area's recreational fishing harvest has declined, due partly to the region's sluggish economy and also since a Federal law went into effect limiting andlers to 10 bluefish (the most popular sporting fish on the East Coast) a day.

Or at least Britain's rapacious television commentators seemed to feel its disappearance was welcome; they had mocked the poor beast unmercifully since it first lumbered to life.   A roundelay of romantic entanglements and low-life skulduggery set in an imaginary Spanish resort community, the series was everything that Anglophilic admirers of Masterpiece Theater think is foreign to British television: bloated, leaden, dull. Worst of all, it committed the sin of sins for a soap: the characters weren't sexy, weren't appealing, weren't in any way suitable for fantastical self-projection by couch potatoes. They weren't even ordinary enough to seem lifelike. Money Couldn't Buy Love    The set alone, built in southern Spain, cost more than $3 million; the budget was five times that, making the show the most expensive independent production ever commissioned by the BBC. The critics, especially in London's tabloid press, were merciless: \"In its early days, 157 episodes ago, 'Eldorado' was almost treasurably bad,\" The Guardian wrote just before the final show on July 9. \"But then it began to improve. It became mediocre instead of dire.\" The audience watched elsewhere, with rarely more than a third of the projected 15 million people tuning in. The Producer's Assessment    As it happens, \"Eldorado\" was meant, at least in part, to be a serious soap, and its producer, Verity Lambert, has been quoted to the effect that it failed not because it was bad but because it was too experimental. Her credits, after all, include shows of just the sort that have given British television a good name in the United States: \"Dr. Who,\" \"Rumpole of the Bailey,\" \"The Naked Civil Servant\" and the like. And the new head of drama for the BBC, Charles Denton, seems now to be aiming even lower, unashamedly courting the biggest possible audience. \"We are in direct competition with ITV for the mainstream popular audience,\" he told The Independent.

the first-person accounts of bouts with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The young women who deliver them may not fully understand the roots of their compulsion to starve or stuff themselves, but their vivid memories leave no doubt of its power and the deep unhappiness from which it springs.   Their straightforward descriptions are in contrast to the visual pretensions and theoretical mishmash that fill much of the rest of this 90-minute Canadian documentary, which was shown on Cinemax last year. Most of it is devoted not to illnesses associated with food, but to the more general question of why so many women can't stand being fat. Starting with the proposition that an obsession with thinness prevails in North America -- where 5-foot-4-inch, 140-pound women dream of being 5-10 and 110 pounds -- the program serves up a miscellany of purportedly expert opinions on why this is so, from the points of view of a Jungian psychoanalyst, a professor of women's studies and assorted psychologists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930811","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/11/nyregion/news-summary-377593.html","abstract":"  International A2-9  COMMANDOS MAY GO TO SOMALIA  The U.S. is considering using commandos in Somalia to search for Gen.

Mr. Clinton first proposed increasing fees for grazing and mining on Federal lands in his budget package, but backed off when Western senators threatened to scuttle the whole package if those fees were in it. His pullback added to the perception -- in full bloom at the time -- of a floundering fledgling in the Oval Office. But if Mr. Clinton can now accomplish most of the same objective through normal rule-making without a draining battle in Congress, his early retreat may nourish the notion that he knows what works and what doesn't.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930811","headline":"How Bosnia's Saviors Became Its Jailers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/11/opinion/how-bosnias-saviors-became-its-jailers.html","abstract":"Faced with the real possibility of American or NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, and with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic's refusal to return to peace talks in Geneva until the Serbs vacate positions around Sarajevo, the United Nations acted. It made a deal with Bosnian Serb leaders to move U.N. troops into the strategic sites while the Serb forces gradually pull out. But as has been the case so often in the war, the U.N. moves have only ended up helping the Bosnian Serbs. \n\nIt is not that the U.N. approves of the siege of Sarajevo. Its personnel, civil and military, have been killed in the relief effort there by fire from all sides. But it has come to share certain goals with the Bosnian Serb troops of Gen. Ratko Mladic. First and foremost has been forestalling air strikes or any other form of American or NATO intervention to lift the siege. When General Mladic, in a bid to tighten the siege at the end of July, took too much ground too quickly and again provoked the threat of American intervention, the United Nations rescued him by stepping up negotiations with him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930811","headline":"Looking to Advice from the Alumni","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/11/sports/sports-people-olympics-looking-to-advice-from-the-alumni.html","abstract":"  DONNA DE VARONA sees them as an untapped treasure, BILL TOOMEY as a great and dormant asset.
