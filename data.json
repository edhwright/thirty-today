The three slapdash docudramas, one each for ABC, CBS and NBC, are indeed instantly disposable programs. But far less dismissible is the spectacle of commercial television pouncing feverishly and in some instances recklessly on the story of a 17-year-old Long Island girl who shot and disabled the wife of the man she said was her lover for over a year.   Ratings, of course, are at the heart of the matter. And no network has yet gone broke overestimating its audience's appetite for sleaze. Monday's broadcast of NBC's \"Amy Fisher: My Story\" was one of the highest-rated television movies this season, second only to the two parts of \"The Jacksons: An American Dream\" on ABC. Sunday at 9 P.M., CBS's \"Casualties of Love: The 'Long Island Lolita' Story\" will go head to head against \"The Amy Fisher Story\" on ABC.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Police Investigating if Killing Was Connected to Testimony","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/nyregion/police-investigating-if-killing-was-connected-to-testimony.html","abstract":"  A 26-year-old Brooklyn man was shot in the face and killed when he answered his door on Tuesday, a day after he testified before a grand jury against a man who robbed him of $200, the police said yesterday.

The deed she commits is hideous, the swiftness of the act frightening, but she does not have the aspect of a villain. In her insane urge to rescue her stepdaughter's reputation, to save Jenufa by murdering Jenufa's child, she somehow saves herself from unambiguous damnation. The forgiveness she receives is the linchpin of a matchless dramatic structure, one in which the most lurid deed is committed by a woman but the anterior crimes are committed by men.   Anja Silja, singing at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time in more than a decade, had mixed success as Kostelnicka in a cast change on Tuesday night. From her entrance in the middle of Act I, she seemed a bit off the mark. The character first enters almost unnoticed, marching across the stage and then off again with a single cold remark. Then, a few minutes later, she stops a scene of drunken merriment dead in its tracks with a fierce monologue of scorn. Ms. Silja caught the coldness very well, but her second entrance did not cast the proper shadow of overpowering authority. The role is something of a vocal nightmare, and Ms. Silja's lyric-dramatic soprano did not have enough fullness of tone in the upper register. The acting was finely shaded and intelligent, but a certain demonic spark was missing. These are intangible qualities, but \"Jenufa\" depends upon them to make its fullest impact.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Today's TV Listings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/arts/today-s-tv-listings.html","abstract":"  Television listings appear today on page B15.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Political Memo; The New Year at a New Age Retreat: The Clintons in Agreeable Company","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/us/political-memo-new-year-new-age-retreat-clintons-agreeable-company.html","abstract":"  The sight of the President-elect and the First Lady-elect arriving here today with monogrammed (BC and HRC) matching overstuffed boxes of work papers to celebrate New Year's Eve by talking about \"personal and national renewal\" with 1,500 friends invites the question:   Is America really ready for the Renaissance?","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Police Query 2 in Search For Girl, 10","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/nyregion/police-query-2-in-search-for-girl-10.html","abstract":"  As the authorities continued to search for Katie Beers, the 10-year-old who disappeared from a Long Island video arcade on Monday, a lawyer here said today that the police were focusing on two of his firm's clients as possible suspects in the case.

And since the production was last reviewed, new singers have taken up most of the other roles, and James Levine has taken over the conducting from Seiji Ozawa.   A listener might have expected so many changes to make for a diffuse \"Onegin,\" but the performance Mr. Levine led on Monday evening was anything but that. Mr. Croft and Jerry Hadley, as Lenski, were not only both in fine voice but also conveyed the subtleties and tensions in their characters' shifting relationship. All of the principals, in fact, touched on the inner passions and torments that lie within the Pushkin poem and which Tchaikovsky's music magnifies so splendidly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"Foreign Affairs; The U.N.

He said he told the 48-year-old Handley on Monday that a change would be made. At a 10 o'clock meeting this morning, Handley told his assistant coaches of the decision.

The selected works, by Schein, Praetorius, Schutz, Tunder, Sweelinck and Weckmann, would make sense together no matter what the season.  And the performances, under the direction of Gwendolyn Toth, had a youthful flair, even a certain sensuality, that stood out in a season of routine ritual.   Schein's instrumental Suite in G established the virtues of Artek's sound: pungent, sharply textured and fully expressive. Motets of Praetorius and Schutz followed (\"In Dulci Jubilo,\" \"Heute Ist Christus der Herr Geboren\"); the voices of Evelyn Simon, a soprano, Daniel Gundlach, a countertenor, and David Frye, a tenor, were not smoothly blended at first, but their ensemble warmed up as the evening went on. Mr. Gundlach delivered an impressive solo for Franz Tunder's \"Kleines Kindelein.\" Ms. Toth, who accompanied at a small console organ throughout, played solo in \"Ons Is Gheboren Een Kindekijn,\" by Jan Sweelinck, teacher of many important German composers of the period.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921231","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"War Crimes in Bosnia - And in Somalia as Well.
