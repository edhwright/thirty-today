Not bad for three men over 50 and a 48-year-old mother of five. What made the excitement all the odder was that during its brief existence (1965 to 1968, in this configuration), the Velvet Underground sold hardly any records at all. Hostile to peace-and-love banalities, irreducibly New York in attitude, the band epitomized the coolness of the downtown Manhattan art scene and the sex-and-drugs danger of the city at night. Division, Then Reunion    Ignored or reviled by the American public and the record industry, the Velvets still had an enormous influence, especially when they were taken up by Andy Warhol and given a temporary new lead singer in Nico, his latest \"superstar.\" Blending Lou Reed's adult poetry with John Cale's vanguard musical experimentation, the Velvets were the parents of the entire art rock, punk, new-wave and college rock scenes worldwide.   Bitterness kept the Velvets apart. Mr. Reed had forced Mr. Cale out in 1968 and embarked on his solo career in 1970. Sterling Morrison, who had been a college classmate of Mr. Reed's at Syracuse University, wouldn't talk to his old friend for years, until a new band contract was signed in 1986, redistributing record royalties.   Mr. Reed was the only one to sustain a visible career. Mr. Cale made and produced some admired records, but his most notable recent achievement was a 1988 commemoration of Warhol, in collaboration with Mr. Reed, called \"Songs for Drella.\" Maureen Tucker, the band's drummer, lived in Georgia, brought up her children, worked in the computer business and played in underground bands. Mr. Morrison eventually earned a Ph.D. in English literature in Texas, working on tugboats in the Gulf of Mexico and playing in Ms. Tucker's latest band. Nico was killed in a bicycle accident in Ibiza in 1988.   In 1990, at the invitation of the Cartier Foundation, the four surviving band members got together in Paris for a Warhol tribute. That led to a quasi-impromptu public rendition of one of their most famous songs, \"Heroin,\" but was no proper reunion. For that, another meeting in New York, followed by two days of trial-run practice sessions, was necessary before the current European tour got the go-ahead.   The watchword for the reunion is fun. Band members have used the word in many interviews, and while it may be their actual motivating factor, it is also a conscious strategy to subvert cosmic expectations. The problem with a Velvet Underground reunion is that nothing the band will do can match the legend that has grown up around it. As David Sinclair wrote on Monday in The Times of London, \"The group's unique godhead status will begin to diminish almost from the moment they start their first number.\" Fun and Money    Clearly their ambitions are serious, and include the courting of a mass audience that was never theirs in the 1960's. The first big concert takes place tomorrow at the 13,000-seat Wembley Arena in London, with four stadium dates with the Irish band U2 at the end of the month and an appearance at the huge Glastonbury Festival in England on July 25. All of this for a band that never played in Europe.   The four musicians say they have no plans for further activity, but they surely have expectations. An album to be recorded live in Paris from June 15 to 17 will be released by Sire, presumably to coordinate with American performances. The issue is not whether the band will perform in the United States, but when and under what circumstances. \"We're all going our separate ways,\" Mr. Reed said in a group interview between shows in Edinburgh. \"But if anything came up and it seemed very special and it seemed like fun, we'd be receptive.\"   This will mean money, which most of the band members can use. But all four seem sufficiently aware of -- proud of, burdened by, amused at -- their legend not to wish it squandered out of simple greed. They insist they reunited only because they became convinced that their material still held up, still made sense and could still be played best by them. Above all, they resented being intimidated by their own reputation. \"Should we stay in hiding just because a myth is loose in the land?\" Mr. Morrison asked.   No attempt has been made to recreate the exact sound of the old, technically primitive recordings. New equipment lends the band's sound a solidity and variety it never had before. Sylvia Reed, Mr. Reed's wife and manager, is now the Velvets' manager and the designer of their contemporary-looking stage lighting. Mr. Cale has fretted about looking and sounding too slick.   At rehearsals, they relearned the words and musical structures of the old songs and then developed them at will. (Mr. Cale had to learn songs created after his departure; he also now sings a couple of Nico favorites.)   \"We never played them the same way twice back then, so why should we now?\" Mr. Reed asked. As Mr. Cale has said, \"We're in the business of remythologizing, not demythologizing.\" Although repertory for this tour consists basically of old band material, they are gingerly working in some new numbers, including a most effective -- and inescapably Velvet Undergroundish -- item called \"Cast the First Stone\" as the third and final encore Thursday night. Building Enthusiasm    British critics have so far been mixed in their reactions, \"Cleaning up their act seems like cheating,\" one wrote before he had heard a note. Another came right out and argued that since the members of Velvet Underground had purveyed death, they should have died, long ago. But others seemed more impressed then they had expected to be.   \"The language the Velvet Underground invented still communicates the rock 'n' roll verities,\" wrote the critic for The Glasgow Herald. Mr. Sinclair, in The Times of London, seemed to recant his earlier pessimism: \"This show did not produce a feeling of deja vu,\" he wrote on Thursday, \"more an impression that, after 25 years, the rest of the world has only just caught up with them.\"   Those who attended both Edinburgh shows found the second, on Thursday, far superior to the first. Nervousness had receded, and the band was beginning to generate an excitement that will surely build over the tour. Certainly the audience loved it, standing throughout the two-hour set and cheering wildly.   Indeed, there was much to cheer. Mr. Reed still sings with the same ominous distinctiveness; Mr. Cale is still the same multi-faceted musical saboteur; Mr. Morrison still contributes a guitar sound of weight and solidity. The revelation on Thursday, though, was the diminutive Ms. Tucker's drumming. Standing at her kit and whacking away, she makes a tom-toms-of-doom sound that inspired straight-ahead punk drumming for a generation. The effect is not quirky or amateurish; it is rocklike in the granitic sense of that word, the foundation on which the band could build a creative future to match its potently nostalgic past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930605","headline":"North Korea Isn't Convinced It Should Stay in Nuclear Pact","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/05/world/north-korea-isn-t-convinced-it-should-stay-in-nuclear-pact.html","abstract":"  United States negotiators failed again today to persuade North Korea to drop its plans to withdraw next week from an international treaty intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

Suffering through an off night, the all-American pitcher allowed 12 hits and 5 runs and threw 172 pitches before the Longhorns edged Oklahoma State, 6-5, in a first-round game. Kieschnick (16-3), a first-round draft pick of the Chicago Cubs, gave up singles to Sean Hugo and Peter Prodanov in the ninth before making Thad Chaddrick his 11th strikeout victim to end the game. In an afternoon game, Darren Dreifort, Wichita State's relief ace, hit the game-winning home run in the 11th inning and then got the save as Wichita State defeated Arizona State, 4-3. Dreifort was within a strike of collecting his fifth save of the season in the ninth when A.S.U.'s Sean Tyler hit a homer to tie the score at 3-3. But Dreifort (11-1), a second-round choice of the Dodgers in the draft, hit his 21st homer to lead off the 11th and then survived a two-on rally in the bottom of the inning. Dreifort was chosen second by the Dodgers in the major league draft. (AP) TENNIS Navratilova Is Winner Top-seeded Martina Navratilova took advantage of the service errors and inexperience of Dutch teen-ager Kristie Boogert yesterday to post a 6-3, 6-3 victory at the Beckenham grass-court event in England. Navratilova then made a plea to Wimbledon's seeding committee to put her in the half of the draw that doesn't contain defending champion Steffi Graf. \"I think I should be seeded joint No. 2 with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario behind Steffi,\" said the nine-time Wimbledon champion. Navratilova does not want to be seeded third and face the possibility of meeting Graf in the Wimbledon semifinals. The fifth-seeded Boogert, 19 years old, broke Navratilova's serve early in the second set but then was broken three times by the 36-year-old left-hander. In the men's semifinals of the exhibition tournament, second-seeded David Wheaton defeated fellow American Ken Flach, 6-7 (7-9), 6-3, 6-2. Wheaton, a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1991, will face Chris Bailey of Britain in today's final. Bailey also needed three sets to defeat 13th-seeded Grant Stafford of South Africa, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-3. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD Near-Miss for Bubka Sergei Bubka cleared 19 feet 2 1/4 inches, then barely missed a world pole vault record of 20-1 3/4 last night at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore. The Ukrainian, who has set world records 34 times, got off to a rocky start by missing at 18-8 1/4. But he sailed easily over the bar on his second try at that height and on his first attempt at 19-2 1/4 before asking that the bar be set just above his world-record mark of 20-1 1/4. Last week, Bubka cleared 19-8 1/4 at the Bruce Jenner Classic last week for the highest vault ever on United States soil, but he did not attempt a world record then, waiting instead for the Prefontaine meet.   Both the Prefontaine meet and Bubka are sponsored by Nike. Bubka missed badly on his first world-record try but nearly cleared it on his second, knocking the bar off with his torso on the way down. His third attempt was even closer. He made it all the way over the bar but brushed it with his arms. The bar stayed in place for an instant, then fell. Bubka tied the meet and Hayward Field record set by Kory Tarpenning in 1988. Tarpenning was second yesterday at 18-8 1/4. (AP) Hometown Heroes: Luann Williams, former Clara Barton High School of Brooklyn star now at Odessa (Tex.) Junior College, took both women's sprints yesterday in the Coors/Metropolitan Athletics Congress outdoor track and field championships at St. John's. Williams, the national junior college champion in the 100 and 200 meters, won the 100 in 12 seconds and the 200 in 24.43 seconds yesterday, running for the Caribbean Connection Track Club. She almost lost the 100 when her starting blocks slipped, and she got off poorly. However, Williams made up ground quickly and caught Marissa Maggio of Anderson International at the tape as both were clocked in the same time. Charlene Neptune, Williams's teammate at Clara Barton, Odessa and the Caribbean Connection, finished first in the 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 32.47 seconds. She was second in the 800 meters at 2:10.34 behind Adina Valdez of the Westchester Track Club, who won in 2:06.52. In men's events, Ric Liddie of the Pioneer Club, former Andrew Jackson runner, upset Larry Gardner of Nike Atlantic in the 400 meters with a time of 47.77 seconds.  GOLF  Baker's Lead Is Cut Peter Baker, after shooting an even-par 72, had his three-stroke lead trimmed to one yesterday in the Dunhill British Masters in Woburn, England. Baker, a 25-year-old Briton who vaulted into the lead with a course record-tying 64 on Friday, managed a lone birdie on his third trip over the 6,940-yard Duke's course and was at 13-under 203. That left him just one shot ahead of countryman Carl Mason, Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland and Joakim Haeggman of Sweden. Mason and Haeggman shot 69's, and Rafferty, who birdied the last two holes, had a 70 and was at 204. Sandy Lyle, a former Masters titleholder at Augusta, followed his second-round 65 with a 70 and was another stroke off the pace at 205. Bernhard Langer, winner of this year's Masters at Augusta, fell five shots off the lead with a 71. (AP) Title for Florida: Florida won the team championship and Arizona State's Todd Demsey won the individual title at the N.C.A.A. men's tournament in Lexington, Ky., when Georgia Tech's David Duval couldn't par the final hole. Florida, which relinquished the lead to Georgia Tech after the third round and trailed by three strokes heading into the final 18 holes, shot a five-under-par 283 to finish at seven-under 1,145 on the par-72 Champions course. Georgia Tech was one stroke back while North Carolina finished third in the 15-team tournament with a five-under 1,147. Demsey, who had three birdies yesterday in recording a three-under 69, finished with a 10-under 278, while Duval's 70 put him a stroke back in second. The Gators, who also won the tournament in 1968 and 1973, clinched the title when Chris Couch sank a four-foot putt for par on No. 18. The Gators also won the tournament in 1968 and 1973. (AP) SOCCER Bundesliga Decided Bernd Hobsch scored two second-half goals and Werder Bremen shut out VfB Stuttgart, 3-0, yesterday in Berlin to capture the Bundesliga title. Bremen entered the game with the same 18-10-5 record as Bayern Munich, but Munich saw its hopes for a record 13th crown end in a 3-3 draw against Schalke. Bremen, the champion in 1965 and 1988, broke a 0-0 tie when Hobsch fired his first goal in the 46th minute. Thomas Wolter scored four minutes later to make the score 2-0, and Hobsch scored again in the 74th minute. Munich had been in first place since opening day before Bremen took over first last Saturday. Bayer Leverkusen secured a UEFA Cup berth for next season with its 4-0 victory over Monchengladbach.

Other states are looking at Connecticut to see how to handle rabies.\"    Fairfield County is completely saturated with the disease, Litchfield County heavily infected. Other parts of the state west of the Connecticut River are experiencing an upsurge in cases with the spring population boom, according to Dr. LeGeyt. More than 1,300 cases of rabies have been identified in wild and domestic animals throughout Connecticut since 1991. \"We have been expecting rabies here since 1986,\" said the director of the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Association, Harry Shook. The disease has been traveling through the Middle Atlantic region since 1977. Though thousands of exposures have been counted nationally, not one case of human rabies has been identified because the post-exposure treatment is so effective, Dr. LeGeyt said.  Ebbs and Flows    The virus ebbs and flows in a cycle that depends on how fast the wildlife re-populates. Cases will decline first in the areas first affected, like Fairfield County. A decline is expected in these areas in two to three years, said Dr. LeGeyt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Lucy S. Waller, Charles J.

So what exactly possessed me to suggest to my family an elemental vacation in the Wild West -- whitewater rafting for five days on the Green River in Utah, followed by a week at a dude ranch in central Colorado? It may have been that I was turning 40. Nor could I deny some stirrings as I watched Billy Crystal and his buddies sitting around a campfire with real-life cowboys in \"City Slickers.\" And, more simply still, our whole family had had it with sedentary, surprise-free vacations by the beach. So off west we went.\n\nMy kids were in rapture almost from the moment we arrived at Lost Valley Ranch, late on a Sunday afternoon in August. For Deborah and me, it was the setting that first captured our hearts: a working ranch nine miles down a dirt road in the 23,000-acre Pike National Forest, in a sweeping valley surrounded on every side by majestic mountains. For Kate, 11, and Emily, 7, the horses were the instant source of excitement. After the wranglers put on a welcoming mini-rodeo, we all walked over to the stables. As the kids were being fitted to saddles, it dawned on them that they were about to be given horses of their own for the next week -- huge, sleek animals fully prepared to take them wherever they wanted to go. From that moment on, our children became utterly self-sufficient. They had the run of the ranch. They rode with their peers, and we spent time with them at meals, by the pool in the late afternoon and after their evening activities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Kay Beyer, Hilary Childs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/style/engagements-kay-beyer-hilary-childs.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. John H.

Last month checkpoints were being set up on many of the country's major highways, in what the Mexican Attorney General's office said was an attempt to stem drug trafficking and crime on the roads. (The plan was being implemented well before the fatal shooting late last month of Juan Jesus Cardinal Posadas Ocampo and six other people at Guadalajara Airport. Officials said the shooting was a fight between rival groups of drug traffickers, and that the Cardinal was mistaken for one of them.)\n\nThe first highway checkpoints are being established in Mexico's northern and Pacific coast states, including Baja California Norte, Sonora and Chihuahua, and in southern states like Oaxaca and Chiapas.

One sort of food writer assumes that the cook wants and needs to be told what to do in a prescriptive fashion -- make it work, make it beautiful. But from the opposite camp come recipes aimed at some presumably smaller number of cooks who are confident enough and experienced enough to search out the cooking tutors who will simply show them the way and set them free.   Elizabeth David, the British food writer, was renowned for being a cookbook author in the latter camp (the American chef Anne Rosenzweig once said of David's writing: \"Recipes were not recipes; they were ideas\"). More recently, there have been many other strong examples of the approach. Among contemporary books, Shirley King's \"Fish: The Basics\" comes to mind for its willingness to give direction and then trust the cook to do something with it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"TRAVEL;\nArcadia: Last of the Head Trips","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/books/travel-arcadia-last-of-the-head-trips.html","abstract":"THE travel book, like the novel, is a literary genre apparently without rules. Fourteen lines are mandatory in a sonnet, and a tragedy must end with someone's death, but the travel book is free from precept or precedent: it needs only to describe a journey, which writing -- as the movement of language through time -- automatically does. Nevertheless, the best travel books owe a secret allegiance to one of the most ancient literary genres: they all turn out to be versions of pastoral.\n\nPastoral is the form that depicts the paradise we have lost, the rustic simplicity of a good life in a golden age. The pastoral ideal of the classical poets, from Theocritus to Sir Philip Sidney, was irretrievably distant in time. For the travel writer, the idyll is teasingly remote in space, but can be reached by consulting the airline schedules.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Brown Is Late at Start But Early at the Finish","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/rowing-brown-is-late-at-start-but-early-at-the-finish.html","abstract":"  The Brown crew, the men's varsity eight that had hardly been tested this season, was a little casual and a little tardy in reaching the starting line today for the championship race of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta on the Cooper River course.

And it's almost true. Bisected by Route 6, Cape Cod's main artery, Eastham appears at first glance to have little of even passing interest, besides a glimpse of water and a vaguely hat-shaped visitor center. To most hurried visitors, \"the gateway\" to the National Seashore, as Eastham is known, remains a stop for gas on the way to the beach; for those who pause a moment longer on their way to Wellfleet or Provincetown, it's a straggle of efficiency cottages, a few motels and a handful of slightly faded roadside attractions. No blown glass, no band concerts, no yacht club.    But for those who linger, Eastham provides its own quiet blandishments. The sun rises over the ocean on one edge of town, and sets a few miles away over Cape Cod Bay. In between sunrise and sunset, you can swim across a couple of freshwater ponds, or brood by a salt marsh. A watery, drifting place, Eastham loses a bit of itself every year to the tides, shored up only by beach grass and scrub pine. Where the ground isn't spongy, it's sandy. Long ago, I decided that this tentative quality must be why Eastham has stayed so unassuming, blessedly free of choked harbors, of restaurants that treat lobster as haute cuisine, of golf courses larger than half an acre. Instead it's a mom-and-pop kind of town; the same family has always owned the general store, and a rented bicycle comes with a desultory chat about back roads, and a reminder to wear a helmet. When you spot someone wearing Spandex on the bike path, you know he's ridden in from somewhere else.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Brown, a Free Agent, Wants to Stay Put","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/sports-people-football-brown-a-free-agent-wants-to-stay-put.html","abstract":"  Bengals wide receiver EDDIE BROWN, just granted free-agent status, says he'll consider remaining in Cincinnati.   \"Cincinnati is still in my heart,\" Brown said Friday after an arbitrator made him a free agent, ruling that an injury to his neck was football-related.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Quentin Crisp on Playing the Queen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/movies/film-quentin-crisp-on-playing-the-queen.html","abstract":"  For the movie \"Orlando,\" the director Sally Potter asked the author Quentin Crisp, then 83, to play Queen Elizabeth I at age 67.

It was 1956, the year of her first marriage and two years before her first solo show in San Francisco. So when she hit Manhattan in 1960 with the first of several shows at Staempfli Gallery, the artist, then 22 years old, was still something of a prodigy. The canvases from this phase are loaded with pigment, much of it red; later on, when Ms. Brown switched to enamel, the turbulence subsided but the ingenuousness remained for the rest of her life, which ended in an accident in 1990.    To judge from the 1970's works on view in the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford, the artist was selectively naive, producing an improbable painting of revelers one moment and sophisticated drawings of nudes the next. A clue to her outlook may be found in six self-portraits in which the headgear changes while the face, with its large pale green eyes, remains consistently bland. In these Ms. Brown was as much a master of deadpan as is Ed Ruscha in his images with words.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"West by West Puts His Feet in the Handicap Picture","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/horse-racing-west-by-west-puts-his-feet-in-the-handicap-picture.html","abstract":"  In the hours before the festive air of Belmont Day was shattered, some of the best-known horses in racing competed in three major stakes leading to the main event of a day marked by extreme swings of fortune.

Like the Napa Valley of the early 1970's, the peninsula between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie is fertile territory for new, ambitious estates with big ideas. They are coaxing good wine from young grapevines and impatiently awaiting the nuances that come with older vines and more cellar experience.    Some 25 wineries -- 21 of them established since 1979 -- are cultivating grapes on 15,000 acres luxuriant with European vinifera vines. Entrepreneurs are so optimistic that applications for licenses to start 12 more wineries are pending before the provincial Liquor Control Board. Land values and planted acreage have risen. New buildings, German wine presses and sleek Italian bottling machines are appearing. And rising reputations are nudging revenues upward: Since 1990, sales of the peninsula's premium wines have increased 100 percent.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/books/paperback-best-sellers.html","abstract":"                     Weeks       This   On       Week   List   Fiction                     1   46   JURASSIC PARK, by Michael Crichton.

Curiously, though flying was then more primitive, it was also more comfortable. In 1934, American Airlines coaxed Douglas Aircraft into coming up with something that would be called a DC-3. This pleasure dome would carry 14 passengers, with one berth each, from New York to Los Angeles. Before then, the trip took 25 hours and required 15 stops. Now you stopped only three times, and were there in 17 hours and 30 minutes. The volume's endpapers invoke the view-from-the-air of the modernist T.W.A. The graphic shows us two routes from west to east. To fly to Europe meant landings at Newfoundland, Ireland and Paris or Newfoundland, the Azores and Lisbon. It is the curse of the jet that except when traveling to the Far East one is never in it long enough to eat, drink, be merry and sleep. The label art reminds us at once of the airlines' utilitarian beginnings (\"Hoosier Airplane Lines. 1923 Charter. 1924 Air Taxi. Serving Fort Wayne, Muncie, Indianapolis, Vincennes and Terre Haute. 'Silver Wings,' Operator\") and of the ends they would go to in trying to make you feel loved. \"American Flagship Skysleeper\" wasn't a bag tag -- that was the legend painted on the hull of the DC-3. When ux and I went off on our wedding trip in 1950, we rented the tail end of the Pan Am DC-4, a mini-suite. Price? $150. . . .

From the beginning, he tells us in STRAIGHT UP OR ON THE ROCKS: A Cultural History of American Drink (Simon & Schuster, $18), this was a tippling country. The colonists displayed a knack for experimentation and improvisation, making alcoholic drink from \"anything that would ferment.\" Beer, cider and especially rum were consumed with gusto and in a myriad of combinations with other ingredients. As America pushed westward, rum gave way to whisky, and the national appetite increased. Liquor was considered a health-giving beverage, and, Mr. Grimes reports, \"At least one 19th-century insurance company imposed a surcharge on abstainers, regarded as weak and weedy, and unquestionably a bad health risk.\" The 19th century saw the rise of the saloon and the emergence of bartending as an honorable and highly respected profession. The later part of the century saw the birth of most of the classic cocktails -- including the martini, the manhattan and the old-fashioned. Prohibition \"turned a lot of beer and wine drinkers into whisky drinkers.\" Gin, once a drink for down-and-outers, became \"the spirit of the age.\" The period following Repeal has been, in the author's view, \"a dreary saga of industry consolidation, mass marketing of image, and anxious trend-watching. The cocktail has suffered as a result.\" And what is the prognosis for the future of the cocktail? Mr. Grimes finds hope in two disparate groups: immigrants, rum and tequila drinkers who may \"impart new vigor\" to the cocktail; and yuppies, whose status-seeking insistence on \"the best\" disdains the blandness of blended whiskies and watery beers. The author includes recipes for 110 cocktails, both classics and worthy newcomers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"In the Region: Connecticut; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/realestate/in-the-region-connecticut-recent-sales.html","abstract":"  Barkhamstead, Conn.  $68,000   167 West Hill Road  3-bedroom, 1-bath, 70-year-old ranch; formal dining room, w/b stove, walk to beach, 1 acre; taxes $917.

No less important is the fact that the Grand Palais show, which continues through June 14, has not been dictated by some satrap of the seminar. It is an unscripted encounter in which works of art never before brought together in such numbers are left free to sort themselves out.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"John F.

It lies on a climatic fault line where westerly winds blowing off the North Sea meet dry winds blowing, reputedly, out of the Russian steppes. People look out their windows into claustrophobic courtyards and then spend their weekends walking through vast, forestlike parks. Architecturally, it is a city of confounding ugliness -- of once pompous prewar buildings with their now charred, or missing, or jarringly restored facades; of banal, poured-concrete apartments and office blocks on both sides of the former wall; of contemporary architectural experiments that can look like recent wounds surrounded by so many scars. It is also a city of exquisite, if infrequent, beauty. Karl Friedrich Schinkel's cool classicism, for instance. And the inspired, often utopian innovations of the 1920's -- many influenced by Schinkel -- are often, even in their postwar, reconstructed versions, still exciting and surprising. Schinkel's buildings, many of which are in the center of the city, are almost unavoidable, but the best examples of Weimar-era architecture are -- to my mind -- the great housing developments known as public-housing estates, or Gross-Siedlung. They are all in the outer districts of town, but easily reached by subway.    The first to be constructed -- and, at the time, the most famous -- was the \"horseshoe,\" or Hufeisen, estate, one section of the Gross-Siedlung Britz, in the working-class borough of Neukolln, southeast of the city center. The Horseshoe Estate, built between 1925 and 1927, is so called because the focal point of its thousand or so dwellings is a horseshoe-shaped three-story apartment building. Three streets of one-family houses surround the horseshoe, and the boundaries of the estate are bordered, for the most part, by three-story apartment houses. Bruno Taut, Weimar Berlin's most productive architect, designed much of the project, including the horseshoe itself, but credit is also given to Martin Wagner, who designed the apartments on the estate's northern boundary. Wagner, as a member of the building society that financed the construction and, later, as Berlin's chief city planner, was the driving force behind the city's 1920's housing revolution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"Sports of The Times; Racing Can't Afford More Tragedies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-racing-can-t-afford-more-tragedies.html","abstract":"  HOW much more of this can racing take?

Growing ridership on the diesel-powered Port Jefferson branch in the late 80's helped create a demand for direct service. By using dual-power technology, along with $2.27 million for double-decker cars, the railroad and the M.T.A. had hoped to increase the capacity of the line without the expense of electrifying east of Huntington, where the third rail ends.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930606","headline":"12th Season for Early Music Festival","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/nyregion/music-12th-season-for-early-music-festival.html","abstract":"  THE Connecticut Early Music Festival celebrates its 12th season with a dozen concerts in eight locations, and an expansion of the term early music to encompass songs of Stephen Foster, even works for period instruments by seven contemporary composers.

Always at the top of the dispute list is \"obscene art.\" The work funded by the endowment that has stirred an outcry constitutes less than 1 percent of the agency's $175 million budget. Robert Mapplethorpe, for example, spent much of his artistic energy on innovative photographs of flowers -- the black and white depictions of homoeroticism constituted a small, but nonetheless vital, part of his lifetime body of work. The imposition of standards of decency can only turn funded works into formulaic colors on canvas, a contradiction of what artistic expression really is.   What should be kept in mind, though, is that a good deal of arts endowment dollars bring exhibitions and performance to rural areas of the United States where residents would not otherwise be exposed to or engaged in the artistic discourse of America today. The endowment also aids in the genesis and production of ballet and operatic performance in cities, long suffering from both Federal and state cutbacks in funds.   The first job of the new head should be to enlighten citizens about the functions and benefits of the National Endowment for the Arts, and to dispel the misconceptions introduced during the last 12 years. Only then can the agency engage the public in the multifaceted and forever evolving conversation we know as American art. ELISE H.

The last 12 years of conservative claims that these things can coexist by cutting the fat out of our Government have been refuted by a quadrupling of the national debt in that period.

But Prairie Bayou, who had run second in the Kentucky Derby and first in the Preakness, suffered compound fractures in his left foreleg and was destroyed by injection about 30 minutes later.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930607","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/07/nyregion/c-corrections-842693.html","abstract":"  A chart on Wednesday with an article about proposed energy taxes described two elements of the plan incorrectly. As passed by the House, the plan would tax liquefied petroleum gas at 26.8 cents per million British Thermal Units, not 61.0 cents, and would impose a natural gas tax on consumers, not utilities.    The related article referred to an economist incorrectly.

But almost everyone is too ready to agree on a key issue of historical responsibility.    It is now conventional wisdom that Germany, by extending diplomatic recognition to Croatia and Slovenia in late December 1991, forced the breakup of the old Yugoslav federation, making the subsequent tragedy in Bosnia inevitable. That's a strained reading of the chronological record. Worse, it conceals the real dynamics of the crisis, inviting future policy mistakes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930607","headline":"Ellen S.
