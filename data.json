The room in the Uffizi Gallery, formerly hung with paintings by the Italian 16th-century master Dosso Dossi, looks directly over the narrow street on which a car bomb exploded one night late last month.   Through that enormous opening in the wall, the view is breathtaking and horrific: set against the backdrop of the soft Tuscan hills and the great dome that Brunelleschi designed for the cathedral are the shattered red tile roofs of the buildings across the street from the Uffizi and the crumbled shell of an adjacent tower, in which a family killed in the explosion used to live. A few household belongings can still be seen on what remains of the tower's top floor, reduced to barely more than a roofless platform. Historic agricultural archives housed in the tower were destroyed. If it weren't for the backdrop, the whole scene would bring to mind Sarajevo instead of Florence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930617","headline":"CLINTON SEES CUT IN SPACE STATION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/us/clinton-sees-cut-in-space-station.html","abstract":"  President Clinton has decided not to kill the eight-year-old space station project but to proceed instead with a slightly slimmed version of the original design, costing about $10.5 billion over five years, a senior Administration official said today.

But Jackson Heights is also the home to Little Colombia -- where high-level drug dealers operate and where much of their cash is laundered through travel agencies and wire transfer services that line Roosevelt Avenue in conspicuous numbers. By coincidence, the community is also the city's new capital for houses of prostitution.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930617","headline":"2 Leaders Propose Dividing Bosnia Into Three Areas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/world/2-leaders-propose-dividing-bosnia-into-three-areas.html","abstract":"  The leaders of Serbia and Croatia, the two most powerful republics in the old Yugoslav federation, today proposed scrapping the international plan for ending the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and offered one of their own.

But the railroad rejected, at least for now, a bolder plan to continue the trans-Hudson tracks eastward across Westchester, through White Plains to Port Chester. Such a line would break the radial nature of the train system by connecting the Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines, allowing people to move easily by train among suburbs and satellite cities rather than simply commuting in and out of Manhattan. But the railroad said that a train would draw only about 15 percent of the people who drive, because their destinations on the Westchester-Connecticut side are so diffuse.  Wanted: A Direct Route    In contrast, the railroad said, 60 percent of the people who commute to Manhattan from New York west of the Hudson during peak hours would do so by train if one were available that took a reasonably direct route. By way of comparison, the railroad said that in Westchester it captures 75 percent of those passengers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930617","headline":"Now Read The Rules To Japan","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/opinion/IHT-now-read-the-rules-to-japan.html","abstract":"At regular intervals, like the dance of the hours in the great clock towers of Central Europe, there is movement about Japan.

In tonight's second segment, Bernard Goldberg takes a similar attitude toward the family of a Marine colonel, James Sabow, who officials say committed suicide in 1991; his wife, children and brother maintain that he was murdered, probably by military brass trying to cover up their activities in the drug trade.

The Museum of Television and Radio decided, quite rightly, to focus on Mr. Irons's performances going back to the 1970's in \"Love for Lydia\" and continuing through, among other productions, \"Brideshead Revisited\" (1980-81) and \"Tales From Hollywood\" (1992). Not so coincidentally, Mr. Irons can be seen doing an especially intense turn on Bravo tomorrow night, at 7 and at 1:30 A.M., in the American premiere of the BBC production of \"The Dream\" (1990).    Adapted by Murray Watts from \"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man,\" Dostoyevsky's last short story, \"The Dream\" is a monologue. The Man -- admittedly, I'm always suspicious of characters called the Anything, but here it works -- sits in a mansionlike setting that could be either a home or an insane asylum.

The Pattern and Decorative movement of the 1970's tried to effect a truce, but negotiations faltered in the 80's. A furniture-as-art vogue came and went overnight, and craft objects showed up in the work of consumerist artists like Jeff Koons and Haim Steinbach chiefly for their irony value. The present trend toward multiculturalism might reconcile the two categories, and exhibitions like \"Africa Explores\" at the Center (now Museum) for African Art a few years ago demonstrated how it could be done. But crossover figures in New York City galleries are still rare.   All of which gives \"Glass Installations,\" at the American Craft Museum, more than usual interest. The six participating artists have created large-scale, site-specific installations from glass, a medium long identified with discrete functional forms and highly specialized techniques. In doing so, they obscure -- with varying degrees of success -- the line between traditional craft and the kind of politically and psychologically motivated installation art popular today. While none of the work in the show is earthshakingly radical -- in fact, some of it feels vaguely familiar and expressively tepid -- it represents a step in an interesting direction, and a good one for the American Craft Museum to be taking at this time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Rhode Island Governor Settles Paternity Suit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/us/rhode-island-governor-settles-paternity-suit.html","abstract":"  Gov.

People are foxes (who know many things) or hedgehogs (who know one big thing); Apollonians (advocates of order and classical discipline) or Dionysians (revelers in the romantic and the extreme). Writers are palefaces (genteel surveyors of sensibility, like Henry James) or redskins (raucous explorers of the outer limits, like Melville). One is \"in\" or \"out\"; in Nancy Mitford's words, \"U\" or \"Non-U.\" Or, as Ken Kesey once put it, you're either on the bus or off the bus.   Recently, however, such amusing distinctions have given way to more serious efforts to pigeonhole the world, efforts that underscore our tendency to see everything in terms of either-or, all-or-nothing, left-or-right. Teen-agers used to ask each other, \"Are you a fan of the Stones or the Beatles?\" John or Paul? Those innocuous questions, used to categorize one as a human being, have been replaced by similarly reductive -- but considerably more loaded -- litmus tests: Are you \"pro life\" or \"pro choice\"? Are you for unemployed loggers or endangered spotted owls? Do you believe Anita Hill or Clarence Thomas? Is Bosnia another Holocaust or another Vietnam?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"Review/Art; Shades of a Rebirth for Painting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/arts/review-art-shades-of-a-rebirth-for-painting.html","abstract":"  After a year dominated by everything but painting -- sculpture, installation art, late-Conceptual political art and so on -- the 1992-93 art season is winding down with a flurry of group painting exhibitions, almost all of them in SoHo. It would be stretching things to say that the medium is making a comeback, although it's about time: like the Democrats, painting has been out of office for so long that, in theory, it ought to be able to do some good. But it does seem that painting has a higher priority among young entry-level artists than it has had in recent seasons. With several galleries mounting painting shows concentrating on younger painters, re-election could be just around the corner.    Although these shows hardly represent the full range of painting being done at the moment, even by the younger generation, they do provide some interesting signals about the medium's direction. Cartoons, usually mixed with abstract elements, are especially hot, as are high-key fluorescent colors, which give some of these shows an undeniable visual bounce. Variations on the all-over composition, whose roots go back to Jackson Pollock's abstract drip paintings, continue to proliferate, often made of tiny semi-legible images.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930618","headline":"At Elizabeth High School; A 'Benevolent Despot' Still Speaks His Mind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/18/sports/at-elizabeth-high-school-a-benevolent-despot-still-speaks-his-mind.html","abstract":"  \"I was the black kid of my generation,\" said the man called Coach. \"Rahway was a Waspy place and I'm half Italian, half Albanian.

He had this theory that most of us operated, all our lives long, on skills we had acquired by the age of 22.

For the last five years, the Knitting Factory in the East Village has run its downtown version of the JVC Jazz Festival, called What Is Jazz?   This year's JVC Jazz Festival, as always, features some of the best improvisers in the jazz tradition, including Joe Henderson, Wynton Marsalis, Gerry Mulligan, Betty Carter, Elvin Jones, Freddie Hubbard, Benny Golson, Gary Bartz and many more. And it's heavy on singers, including Lena Horne, Cassandra Wilson, Anita O'Day, Ms. Carter and Mel Torme.

Would they arrive in time or would the war on land have already been decided? No one could answer these questions, though Pentagon operations analysts tried mightily to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930619","headline":"Family Preservation and Its Victims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/19/opinion/family-preservation-and-its-victims.html","abstract":"  Take any floor of a typical low-income housing project. In one apartment, there might be a single woman in her mid-20's with two kids, struggling on a meager welfare check to keep the kids dressed, clean and in school. Down the hall is a family of six. Despite months of looking, Mom works as a maid and Dad, unemployed, does a few odd jobs. At the end of the hall, there is a woman with three kids. She is a heavy crack cocaine user. Her present boyfriend is also her drug supplier, and when he gets angry he hits the kids. Sometimes they lock the kids in the apartment and go off for hours of partying.   The state decides to make life easier for one of these families. Which one? Under welfare laws in Illinois and other states, the mother doing drugs and allowing her boyfriend to belt the kids is the only one entitled to a free housekeeper up to five days a week. She can also receive up to $2,000 for a security deposit and the first month's rent on a new apartment, as well as furniture and up to $500 in cash.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930619","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/19/nyregion/news-summary-786793.html","abstract":"  International 2-5  JAPAN'S GOVERNMENT IS DISSOLVED    Rebel Japanese lawmakers in the ruling party joined the opposition to pass a vote of no confidence in the Government of Kiichi Miyazawa, who then dissolved Parliament and called for elections in July.  1  U.S. ACCEPTS WEAKNESS IN BOSNIA    News analysis: President Clinton's decision to accept the possibility of the ethnic partition of Bosnia reflects a consensus among his advisers that the U.S. is incapable of mediating the war there and unwilling to take military action to stop it.  4    European diplomats turned their focus to the partition of Bosnia.  4    Fighting continued across Bosnia despite another cease-fire.  4  AZERBAIJAN GETS A NEW LEADER    One of the most notorious former officials of the K.G.B. assumed power in Azerbaijan when he announced on television that the former Soviet republic's President had fled to escape advancing rebels.  3  U.N.

That concern is being addressed here this week at the seventh Boston Early Music Festival and Exhibition, which assembles every two years. After exploring the late Classical era in recent years, the festival set aside the newfangled stuff and returned to the movement's roots. This year's program is devoted mainly to music of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when Renaissance styles gave way to Baroque innovations. Its modernist edge is a concert of Colonial and 19th-century American hymns and ballads to be given by the Boston Camerata on Saturday evening.

At a hot and humid Hayward Field, Tolbert overcame favorite Gail Devers, plus medical problems that included a torn hamstring, stress fractures in both her feet and chronic anemia. She edged Devers in a photo finish, winning the women's 100-meter hurdles in 12.72 seconds to foil a historic attempt at a double by her more famous
