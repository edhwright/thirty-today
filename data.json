First of all, though it performs as a trio, the 10-year-old band currently exists only as a vehicle for the songs, solos and obsessions of its front man, the anti-hero of alternative rock guitar, J Mascis. Mr. Mascis is the crown prince of slackers: he functions at the lowest energy level possible in interviews, on the stage and in life. Life, if one is to believe Mr. Mascis' songs of dashed hopes and heartbreak, is an ever-widening wound that is best borne under heavy anesthesia.   On Friday, Mr. Mascis summed up this philosophy best in \"Feel the Pain,\" from his new album \"Without a Sound\" (Sire). \"I feel the pain of everyone,\" he sang in a cracking, sleepy voice. \"Then I feel nothing.\" The juxtaposition between these two extreme states seemed to be a guiding principle for Mr. Mascis throughout the show.

It was cold, windy and rainy at Soldier Field on this Halloween night, but none of that was as chilling to the Chicago Bears as the whipping dispensed by the Green Bay Packers. The Bears started slowly and finished that way. The Packers started with a few slips but finished upright, thwarting the Bears by 33-6. - \"I've never played in conditions like that. It was like playing in Hurricane Camille, except it was 80 degrees cooler,\" said Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, who ran for one touchdown and passed for another. \"It was unbelievable. I went out in pregame and said, 'I might not complete a pass,' and I almost lived up to it.\"   Green Bay led by 14-0 at halftime and never looked back in scoring the game's first 27 points. The finishing touches were a 1-yard, third-quarter run by Edgar Bennett and, in the final quarter, a Bennett 13-yard score on a swing pass from Favre and a 9-yard scoring run by Reggie Cobb. For Bennett, it was a three-touchdown night.   Chicago -- which entered this game averaging only 18.4 points scored per game and had not scored more than 22 points in any game this season -- knew it was in trouble after falling behind, regardless of the terrible weather.   Quarterback Erik Kramer was ineffective and was replaced by Steve Walsh to begin the second half. Walsh finally connected, in between the Packers final two touchdowns -- with receiver Jeff Graham on a 5-yard pass that was the Bears' only score.   In this huge game for strong midseason standing in the National Football Conference Central race, Chicago slipped to a 4-4 record and Green Bay matched that mark. Both are tied with Detroit for second place behind the Minnesota Vikings (6-2).   There was one highlight for the Bears: at halftime, in an upbeat ceremony, the numbers of the Bears greats Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers were retired. Chicago finished with five turnovers, the Packers with none.   This was not a game for the faint of heart. At kickoff, the temperature was 43 degrees, the winds gusted up to 53 miles an hour and the windchill factor made the temperature seem 8 degrees. The Bears had their 91st consecutive sellout -- admittedly with 19,563 no-shows -- but more than half the crowd had left by halftime because of the weather.   It was an important and emotional game for Steve McMichael. For the last 23 meetings between these two teams, McMichael had lined up at defensive tackle for the Bears. This time, the 15-year pro, because of a free agent move to Green Bay in the off season, was on the line for the Packers.   It figured that the team that could establish a running game and stick with it would have the upper hand early and late in this 149th clash between the colorful rivals. Turnovers, however, played as large a role in the Packers rumbling to a 14-0 halftime lead.   The Packers found the running on the left side to their liking. The matchup there was left tackle Ken Ruettgers, left guard Guy McIntyre and center Frank Winters versus the Bear right end Alonzo Spellman and right tackle Chris Zorich. It was a matchup the Packers steadily won, with that left side leading Green Bay to a 223-94 lead in rushing yardage.   Favre was 0 for 7 passing until late in the third quarter but he scampered for 36 yards down the right sideline and dove in on the final yard for the touchdown and a 14-0 Green Bay lead with 4:46 left in the half.

Pataki PRODUCER: Russo, Marsh & Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va. VISUAL: Photographs of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Shoreham nuclear plant, plus newspaper headlines and highlights of the script over ominous music. Ends with photograph of Mr. Cuomo scratching his head. SCRIPT: Announcer: \"First, Mario Cuomo cut a cynical deal to buy votes with a $9 billion bailout of Lilco. Now he's cut another deal -- for Rudy Giuliani's support. Just three days after Giuliani's endorsement, The New York Times reported that Giuliani is already counting on $150 million more of your state tax dollars. Billions for Lilco, hundreds of millions for Giuliani and tax increases for us. Don't let Mario Cuomo buy this election with your money.\" ACCURACY: The Governor has proposed a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, which would cost about $9 billion, to be financed through tax-exempt bonds. Politicians of many stripes and the financial markets greeted the idea skeptically. Mr. Cuomo contends a takeover would lead to lower electric rates, by eliminating shareholder dividends and Federal taxes the utility now pays. Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget modification, announced a day after his endorsement of the Governor, does depend on $150 million in new aid from Albany, although he and Mr. Cuomo insist they never discussed any deal, and no governor can deliver much in the way of state aid without the cooperation of the Legislature. Mr. Cuomo has proposed no tax increases. SCORECARD: Mr. Pataki is vulnerable to the charge -- by Mr. Giuliani and other local officials -- that his proposed state income tax cuts would force higher local taxes. This ad tries to turn that attack around, arguing that Mr. Cuomo is the taxer who is pitting different parts of the state against each other. In making that claim, of course, Mr. Pataki seeks to divide the state further, and energize his base in the upstate areas that have provided a growing share of the electorate.  The ad's anti-tax message could hit home, as does its suggestion that the Lilco plan is an election-year gambit. But its conspiracy theory may strike voters as hard to believe, and it does nothing to sketch in Mr. Pataki's own personality or ideas. TODD S.

Cuomo (paid for by the New York State Democratic Committee) PRODUCER Axelrod & Associates, Chicago and Washington ON THE SCREEN Black-and-white scenes of State Senator George E. Pataki, Pat Robertson and a newspaper headline reading \"George is 100 percent 'right' according to Pat Robertson,\" then of assault weapons laid out together, as white letters on black background come zooming into view to highlight parts of script over ominous music. SCRIPT Announcer: \"The more you learn about George Pataki's friends, the more you wonder. As a State Senator, Pataki won the top rating from Pat Robertson's radical coalition, which preaches a ban on abortion and wants creationism taught in our schools. And now, the National Rifle Association's endorsed Pataki, who's opposed tougher gun laws, like the ban on assault weapons. The N.R.A., Pat Robertson and the radical right. If George Pataki's their man, can he really be ours?\" ACCURACY In 1993, Mr. Pataki did receive a 100 percent rating from the Christian Coalition, based on four votes: Medicaid funding for abortions, a bill that finances the Medicaid program through aid to local governments, the section of the budget that provided for postponing scheduled tax cuts and a bill on child pornography. This year, his rating was 83 percent. Mr. Pataki supports abortion rights, though he has voted consistently for restrictions. He says he supports a ban on assault weapons, but in April he voted against an amendment to a gun-licensing bill that included sharp restrictions on a number of assault weapons. At first, he denied the vote, then said it was procedural and now says it was a partisan vote with the Republican majority on a measure that did not go far enough. SCORECARD This is one of the harshest ads of the race, produced and paid for by the State Democratic Committee in part because the Governor's media adviser, David Garth, has opposed making such attacks. But for weeks now, Mr. Cuomo has sought to define Mr. Pataki as out of step with a state that retains a strong plurality of Democratic voters likely to reject a strongly conservative candidate, and polls suggest the Governor's attacks have been working. The risk is that the imputed link between Mr. Pataki and the Christian right is tenuous, and voters may be put off by the tough tone. TODD S.

In an era of sharp cutbacks in government services, and when entitlement programs soak up ever greater portions of government budgets, the net burden of high levels of immigration can no longer be supported. The sentiments of Emma Lazarus's anthem -- to send us your huddled masses -- are simply no longer economically possible or desirable.   American incomes have been stagnant for the last 20 years. The taxpaying population is in revolt and any new taxes to support transfer payments and new social programs are not politically feasible. The impact of population growth on cities and states is demonstrable.   California estimates that the net cost of illegal immigration to the state's taxpayers is more than $3.5 billion. In New York City, the school population has grown by more than 20 percent in the last three years, a phenomenon that is almost entirely immigration-driven.    While immigrants do contribute to the economy, their net impact is negative, especially if they cannot enter the more skilled professions. As welfare reform becomes more urgent, the competition and friction between illegal immigrants and citizens who must integrate into the work force at lower skill levels will become more intense.   The country can no longer support the present legal immigration of 700,000 people annually, let alone illegal immigration levels that push total annual immigration into the millions. Quality of life and environmental and economic realities dictate that even our current population of 260 million consumes too much of the earth's limited resources.   A halt to illegal immigration and a reduction of legal immigration are urgently needed. If both can be accomplished, the natural birth rate of the United States will eventually reverse our population to more sustainable levels.    You place misty-eyed ideology before hard reality in attacking California's Proposition 187. Some of its provisions may be unconstitutional, but its real import is that it is placing the question of out-of-control immigration policy squarely in the center of public discourse where it belongs.

The auction house expects it to sell for about $1.42 million, roughly the price the manuscript of Schumann's Piano Concerto brought in November 1989. The record price for the sale of classical music manuscripts was set in 1987, when nine Mozart symphonies sold for $4.5 million. The manuscript will be on display at Sotheby's in New York City from Tuesday to Friday next week.   If the score is acquired by a library and comes under scholarly scrutiny, it could yield at least subtle changes in the way the music is performed, since it includes alterations and corrections Schumann made as late as 1853.

A 17-knot wind, far brisker than the 5-6 knots that prevailed at the first two races of the championship, made the fight for first place all the more dramatic. One Australia crossed the start line prematurely, and had to re-round. In the meantime, America  was off to a clean start, well ahead of One Australia on the right side of the course.

From 1975 to the early 1980's, Earth Wind and Fire was one of the most popular bands on Earth, singing about love and backing its utopian wishes with music that fused gospel sentiments, funk syncopation, pop melody, jazz harmonies and Latin rhythms. At its peak, Earth Wind and Fire came up with music that was both ingenious and embracing, proffering hope and reassurance through cross-cultural synergy. It was generous music, with an abundance of harmonizing voices and deftly deployed horns. But it couldn't stand up to the corrosive 1980's, when best-selling black pop polarized into bare-bones, confrontational hip-hop or plush come-ons.   Now, Earth Wind and Fire is an oldies act, but still popular enough to sell out two nights at the Beacon Theater. \"We're going to take you back to the 70's,\" Philip Bailey declared on Tuesday. It's a reconstituted band. Maurice White, the band's founder, producer and main songwriter, no longer tours with it; he has taken with him his kalimba, the African thumb piano that was a band trademark. Along with Mr. Bailey, the current lineup includes only two other longtime members, Verdine White on bass and Ralph Johnson on vocals and percussion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941103","headline":"Immortal Latin : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/opinion/IHT-immortal-latin-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The students of the Latin classes at the International School of Brussels and I, their teacher, have read with interest \"Latin, in the Computer Age, Shows Signs of Resuscitating\" (American Topics, Oct. 5) about the renewed interest in Latin in","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941103","headline":"3 Iranians Go on Trial in France in Slaying of Exiled Ex-Premier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/world/3-iranians-go-on-trial-in-france-in-slaying-of-exiled-ex-premier.html","abstract":"  In a case that has already strained relations between Paris and Teheran, three Iranians went on trial here today for the 1991 slaying of Shahpur Bakhtiar, an exiled former Iranian Prime Minister.

The festival got off to an intriguing start on Oct. 8 with a program that featured a concert by Vytautas Landsbergis, the piano-playing first president of free Lithuania. But \"Drama 20/21,\" a comprehensive tribute to Fluxus that suggested both its history and its meaning today, promises to have been the oddest event in the festival.

It offered a series of high jinks on a stage covered with electronic equipment, preserved for posterity by an audience armed with still and video cameras and tape recorders.
