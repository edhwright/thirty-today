On the face of it, Mr. Glass's two-act piece is an interpretation of an interpretation, a gloss on a gloss. And indeed, there are places in it -- Orphee's pursuit of the Princess on the streets of Paris is one -- that mean little without the corresponding images created on film 43 years ago. Condensing here, implying there, \"Orphee\" the opera follows the train of Cocteau's thoughts on a very ancient myth. It uses much of his dialogue verbatim.   Yet in another sense, Mr. Glass's piece is closer to Gluck than to Cocteau. Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice,\" written in 1762, is opera's most prominent hommage to the Orpheus myth. Although the new opera's reference to an old one is brief and fleeting, the flute solo with orchestra that announces the Princess's entrance from the Underworld seems, intentionally or not, more a comment on the music around it then a passing bow to history.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"At Airports, Life in the Slow Lane","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/style/IHT-at-airports-life-in-the-slow-lane.html","abstract":"I HAVE a recurring nightmare of waiting behind two dozen people in the check-in line at a strange airport.

Everything improved: the seating, the service, the size of the portions. We had already reached dessert, but our little plate of petit fours was whisked away to be replaced by a larger, more ostentatious one.

The explanation is that although potential audiences for \"Tennessee\" were eager enough to supply the play with a substantial advance sale, the drop at the box office when the reviews came out -- they weren't terrible, just reserved -- was immediate and huge. Fans of the Irish playwright Brian Friel and his lyrical, understated, obliquely emotional dramas, the theory goes, had already bought their tickets; his reputation had carried the play as far as it was going to, and the show needed the buzz of critical rapture to assume the burden, as it had with Mr. Friel's previous Broadway offering, \"Dancing at Lughnasa.\" On Monday, however, the day after \"Tennessee\" opened, less than $8,000 worth of tickets was sold, a dooming total for a show with weekly operating costs of more than $135,000.

For others, its appeal should be as a cheeky if predictable sendup of erotic obsession and its unhappy consequences.   \"Sex and Zen,\" which opened today at the Cinema Village, is based on Li Yu's novel \"The Carnal Prayer Mat,\" an erotic work that was banned for centuries in China. It follows the sexual swath cut by Mei Yeung Sheng (Lawrence Ng), a knight-errant in fanatical pursuit of ultimate pleasure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"Ballot Issues in Three Regions Debt Questions for New Yorkers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/opinion/ballot-issues-in-three-regions-debt-questions-for-new-yorkers.html","abstract":"  Albany seeks voter approval next week for three constitutional amendments to ease restrictions on New York State and local borrowing.

In its wildly expressionistic opening sequence, Catherine (Jade Leung), a waitress in an eerie, blue-lighted truck stop, goes berserk when a customer makes a pass at her, killing him and a police officer who has been called to the scene. At her arraignment, Catherine shoots her way out of a Los Angeles courtroom in a blitz of gunfire. Moments later, she is kidnapped by the C.I.A., which implants a microchip in her brain and trains her to become a political assassin with the code name Black Cat.   The film, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, makes no pretenses toward realism: the film is a Hong Kong answer to \"La Femme Nikita\" and its American remake, \"Point of No Return.\" \"Black Cat\" is a stylish pop fantasy spun around an invincible female action hero.

Working entirely with the bright and mostly worthless trinkets to be found in souvenir stores, gift shops, toy stores and party-decoration outlets, Mr. Mantello has turned the gallery into maze of zany installations and overloaded assemblage sculptures. He has also painted some walls hot pink, covered others with wallpaper or with blown-up resort photographs, and levitated helium balloons all over the place. Disco music emanates from one work, air freshener from another. With repeated appearances of fake food -- hamburger-shaped yo-yos, plastic bagels, chocolate-kiss pinatas, furry ice cream cones and elaborately iced cakes that the artist makes himself -- there is virtually no sense that isn't aroused, or at least assaulted. Take the young ones, but stick around, for this is a show that grows on grown-ups, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931029","headline":"Review/Film; A Lust for the (Supposedly) Lifeless","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/29/movies/review-film-a-lust-for-the-supposedly-lifeless.html","abstract":"Zombie's splattering rampage.

The threat is also unnecessary, because Nafta doesn't bear on the trade issues that disturb Mr. Chretien the most.    The dispute is mostly about subsidies the Canadian Government gives industries like wheat and lumber. These subsidies are designed to solve domestic problems, like bailing out flagging industries and developing downtrodden regions. But the two countries' economies are so intertwined that domestic subsidies inevitably affect trade between them. Subsidies help Canadian producers lower their prices, giving exporters an \"unfair advantage,\" according to their U.S. competitors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931030","headline":"Secret Tapes Tell of Plan To Kill Bombing Suspect","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/30/nyregion/secret-tapes-tell-of-plan-to-kill-bombing-suspect.html","abstract":"  The Egyptian authorities intended to kill a defendant in the World Trade Center bombing trial when he was arrested and tortured in Egypt a month after the bombing, an informer told the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The concert was part of the Kitchen's Autumnmusic series, which ends tonight.   She found common musical ground with a musician from the opposite side of the globe; Mr. Rothenberg is a New Yorker. Mr. Rothenberg, on alto saxophone, bass clarinet and shakuhachi (a Japanese wooden flute), was a deferential partner to Ms. Namchylak, who sings both traditional Tuvan music and an avant-garde vocabulary of scat syllables, twitters and shrieks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931030","headline":"For County Executive in Nassau","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/30/opinion/for-county-executive-in-nassau.html","abstract":"  Long Island's Nassau County is suffering the effects of a bloated, deeply entrenched political machine.

He understood the intricacies of government and seemed to have a handle on the county budget.   But bad economic times have gotten the best of him. Mr. Gulotta is too tied into the wasteful, patronage-laden ways of the Republican machine to bring the revolutionary changes in government that Nassau needs.

It was the first time since 1982 that the orchestra had played in New York under its own music director (visits in 1986 and 1991 were led by James Levine and Bernard Haitink, respectively). And it was the first time New Yorkers could hear how Mr. Abbado has been shaping this great instrument since he became its caretaker and leader in 1989.   The orchestra looks younger, but its sonic tradition has not been radically modified; it was still recognizably the instrument heard in recordings and previous concerts. The famous sleek strings still had an astonishing elegance; the orchestra as a whole could give a polished, glorious three-dimensional body to sound.

Mothers who had made it through World War II had to endure this compulsive behavior in the 1940's and 50's.\nCHENILLE, THE FASHION PHENOMENON: Sweaters made of another kind of chenille (and we'll get to that shortly) are pouring out of Manhattan stores, enveloping the island in a sea of fuzz. At Barneys New York, where it is possible to spend from $150 to $340 on a chenille sweater, \"chenille's selling faster than anything else,\" said Suzie Welton, a vice president at Barneys. The two Barneys stores together are selling chenille sweaters at a rate of 350 pieces a week. At Eileen Fisher, the rate is an impressive 20 a day per store.\nWHY NOW: Chenille sweaters are post-modern security blankets, said Valerie Steele, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \"In the old days, you felt secure if you were well dressed,\" she continued. \"Now people are bringing out more eccentric security blankets.\" Made by Donna, Ralph or Azzedine.\nMORE NOSTALGIA: At the Lucy Anna Folk Art and Antique Quilt store in the West Village, Karen Taber is selling a slew of old chenille bedspreads to people who remember playing with toy cars between the tufted lines in their bedspreads.\n\n\"It brings back memories to people who don't have many memories,\" she said. She also makes teddy bears and rabbits out of old chenille spreads that her parents find for her.\nWHAT IT'S DOING FOR THE ECONOMY: The interest in antique chenille spreads has revived the bedspread industry, said Ed McNamee, an executive at Georgia Tufters, which produces chenille spreads in Calhoun, Ga. \"Nineteen-eighty was the bad year, when all bedspreads died, as people switched to comforters,\" Mr. McNamee said. \"But now,\" he added gleefully, \"they're paying $200 for stuff we made 40 years ago.\"\nCHENILLE NUANCES: All chenilles are not alike.\n\nThe bedspread fabrics are made by sewing the tufts onto cotton (the newest machines that do this are Individual Controlled Needle machines, Mr. McNamee said). Chenille for sweaters and thousand-dollar dresses, on the other hand, is made in an even trickier and more expensive way: basically, the warp and weft (some say \"woof\") get woven together, then cut into strips and woven again, so that the fuzzy ends stick out.\n\nIra Livingston, a vice president of Cotton Inc., which represents American cotton growers, told me a lot more that I could pass on. Frankly I'd rather be pulling tufts out of a spread.\nTHE MINI-CONTROVERSY: At Eileen Fisher, the sweaters are made with rayon, which doesn't pill like cotton and drapes better, Ms. Fisher said. But cotton has a better weight and takes color better, said Lydia Caffrey, Cotton Inc.'s fashion director. At Barneys, the top-of-the-line sweaters are made with peluche, a long-haired version of chenille yarn that makes fabrics that feel like sealskin and cost more than other chenille.\nETYMOLOGICAL CONFUSION: \"Chenille,\" in French, refers to caterpillars as well as the yarn. And the word derives from the Latin word \"canicula,\" or \"little dog.\" But in English, \"caterpillar\" is derived from the Old French word \"chatepelose,\" which means \"hairy cat.\" How did all this get mixed up? Martha Barnett, a word historian, said, \"It has to do with the way humans tend to name those furry creatures based on their resemblance to other animals.\"\nTIMELY NEW INSULT: \"Laid comme une chenille.\" In French, it means, \"ugly as sin.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Votes in Congress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/votes-in-congress-155093.html","abstract":"  Tally Last Week in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York    Senate   1.

Marra, 52, takes over tomorrow as the Yonkers School Superintendent, the fifth-largest system in the state, he will bring to the city an intimate knowledge of the school district, skill at maneuvering the political minefields of Yonkers and an outgoing, enthusiastic personality.\n\nHe will also continue in the direction of his predecessor, Dr. Donald M. Batista, by carrying out the second stage of desegregating the schools to eliminate \"vestiges of discrimination\" remaining because of inadequate financing. The district recently won a Federal suit for more money that was filed in 1987, and Judge Leonard B. Sand is expected this spring to rule on the amount and source of compensation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Hold the Wine And Pass the Beer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/food-hold-the-wine-and-pass-the-beer.html","abstract":"  BEER is big: there are more varieties of beer than ever on store shelves; new breweries are opening; restaurants are beginning to have beer lists, and many restaurants are designing special menus to accompany an assortment of beers. The beer dinner is replacing the wine dinner. And it can also happen at home.   At a restaurant beer dinner, an assortment of four or five beers are chosen, like wines, to accompany certain dishes. Sometimes the dishes themselves are made with beer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Health Officials See Early Flu Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/health-officials-see-early-flu-season.html","abstract":"SOON it will be that time of year again, when the fever starts to rocket upward, when the runny nose and sore throat set in, when everything starts to ache -- legs, back, head, even the eyes -- and the only thing that looks appealing is a warm bed.

Visitors, particularly the affluent, would come for a month or longer. Many of today's visitors still prefer the period from November to March, when the army of T-shirts thins and cashmeres move in, when beach life scales down and the temperature favors golf and tennis. Hotels and restaurants are not as crowded, rates are lower and cooler does not translate to cold.    At the beginning of the year, in an attempt to convince prospective guests that January toMarch is not cold, a number of hotels offered a \"temperature  guarantee,\" which will be repeated in 1994. During these months, participating hotels (including Lantana Colony, Elbow Beach, the Reefs and the Princess Hotels) will give a 20 percent discount on room rates on any day the temperature does not reach 68 degrees.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Financing A Co-op Privately","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/realestate/your-home-financing-a-co-op-privately.html","abstract":"  ANYONE eager to sell an apartment in a financially troubled New York co-op building is well aware of the frustration that comes from knowing a potential buyer will be refused conventional financing.

Stuart Davis, who studied there from 1910 to 1913 and who briefly reflected its influence before forging his own distinct style, praised the school for taking art \"off the academic pedestal\" and for developing \"the student's confidence in his own perceptions.\" The painter also recalled it as a place for making friends, subject to a rite that involved the initiate buying \"a large quantity of beer.\"    On the other hand, John Sloan regarded his mentor as \"a dominant personality deservedly commanding respect and somewhat impatient of ideas that 'crossed' his own and 'never,' he said, 'felt really close to him.' \" Yet, the Ashcan School painter retained much of Henri's influence; similarly, George Bellows, who said that his life \"began\" at the school, continued to pursue the robust form of Realism practiced and nurtured by Henri. Then there was Man Ray, who studied with the master in Philadelphia and admired him for being \"against what most people were for and for what most people were against,\" and in his own way followed suit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"UNIVERSITY PRESSES -- IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/university-presses-in-short-fiction.html","abstract":"HARLEM RENAISSANCE \nTHE SLEEPER WAKES \nHarlem Renaissance Stories\nby Women.\nEdited and with an introduction by Marcy Knopf.\nRutgers University; cloth, $35; paper, $12.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Improvisation as a Method of Acting","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/improvisation-as-a-method-of-acting.html","abstract":"THE lights in the classroom of the Rochambeau Special School here were still shining late one recent Thursday night as Ann Lawday led her odd assortment of acting students through a final exercise.

And don't forget that a university campus is meant to give Mr. Mamet's work a new imprimatur of environmental correctness that means more than its title.    But that's not what will go on drawing audiences to \"Oleanna,\" even though Mr. Mamet set up the play within the hallowed portals of academia. To be sure, according to low-budget constraints, all the audience sees on stage is an office with a desk and a chair or two that a professor can pick up and hit a student over the head with, but we know there's a university out there.

One example: A hotel shopper looking for a room in Puerto Rico called the small Casa San Jose, a stylish bed and breakfast in San Juan, and asked for the \"best rate.\" The choices for Sept. 12 and 13 were few: A $150 windowless room on the first floor or a $200 suite with a view on the third. The bargain hunter paused to consider: windowless claustrophobia versus a view -- or two long flights of stairs versus convenience. The voice at the hotel broke in: \"You can have the $200 suite for $180.\"   All discounts don't come that easily, especially during the winter high season when expensive hotels are often full. But negotiating is certainly in order. Published rates should not be taken at face value. Some hotelkeepers say without caviling that they will negotiate. On the other hand, the published bargain rate can also slide upward -- a special package may be \"subject to availability.\" Most packages are not available during holidays; the best bargains in winter are in January, when rates dip at many hotels. In any case, discount packages need close scrutiny.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"BACKTALK;\nFrom Baseball and Apple Pie, to Greed and Sky Boxes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/sports/backtalk-from-baseball-and-apple-pie-to-greed-and-sky-boxes.html","abstract":"As George Steinbrenner persists in his uproariously quiet effort to turn a mountain into a molehill (what else would you call the \"New Jersey Yankees\"?), the parallels that are drawn between this particular expression of avarice with ones that took other monuments out of Brooklyn and Upper Manhattan almost four decades ago should be drawn only lightly. Times have changed -- not for the better -- and a larger venality at work here needs to be addressed. If in checking it out, we should stumble on a cure for the madness, like some creative application of the laws of eminent domain, a no-money-back guarantee will be in effect.\n\nTo be sure, Walter O'Malley and Horace Stoneham deserve the notoriety they got when they moved the Dodgers and Giants to California in 1958, forever changing the course of professional sports in America. O'Malley and Stoneham made greed fashionable at a time when owning a pro sports franchise was thought to be more of a love than a living. \"Sportsmen\" owned pro teams, and some were said to have lost fortunes keeping the old home team in the old home town.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"The Fatal Caesar Salad","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/the-fatal-caesar-salad.html","abstract":"A PLACE WHERE THE SEA REMEMBERS\nBy Sandra Benitez.\n163 pp. Minneapolis:\nCoffee House Press. $19.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"In the Traveler's Lost and Found","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/travel/in-the-traveler-s-lost-and-found.html","abstract":"  I HEARD it said a long time ago, in the days when the Egyptian Book of the Dead was regarded as a kind of tour guide to an acid trip, that on every good trip, something precious is lost. It was said that this was in fact the mark of a good trip, the physical item lost representing a letting go of established forms of self -- of status, poses, connections, all manner of possessions.   And so it has been. On every good trip, no matter where, there is a kind of redistribution of belongings, rather like bees pollinating. The lost item reminds you that travel is a two-way process, a kind of binding of person and place in which the place too will have its say. If a place speaks to you then something of you will be left there.

Lee and Larry Olmstead of The New York Times to discuss the candidates and the issues in Tuesday's mayoral election and their feelings about life in New York. The participants were Melissa Woronoff, 20, a college student who divides her time between the Bronx and Manhattan; Ken Shung, 39, a free-lance photographer who lives in Manhattan; Jerolyn J. Minter, a retired college professor who lives in St. Albans, Queens, and Roger D. Fields, a \"40ish\" Harlem resident and the senior vice president of the United Block Front Street Association, a program in which ex-offenders build housing.   What follows are excerpts from their discussion.   What things are most important to you when you look at the quality of life in the city?    ROGER FIELDS: No. 1 is crime, which, as an African-American, is very, very on my mind. And No. 2 is affordable housing. When one talks about upgrading and upper mobility in any community, it must be a safe community. And once you build housing, that housing, which may be comfortable and affordable, has to be in a safe neighborhood.   JEROLYN MINTER: I agree with much of what you're saying, but I think when you put things in order of priority, it's not crime first. Crime is an offshoot of something that I think is more deeply rooted. Attention to education and educational standards, economics, housing -- all are built upon the first fundamental, and that's learning how to understand someone who is different from you that you have to live next door to or in the community right adjacent to yours.   FIELDS: Well, I don't tend to agree with you. When one talks about empowering different ethnic groups, those communities must first have safe streets and must have affordable housing before one can no longer feel stressed. And one gets angry because one sees that one group is getting more than another group, which also causes division.   No. 2, if we talk about education standards, when you develop affordable housing and affordable home ownership, then those communities become mixed and those educational standards become more active, because the community is not monolithic nor mono-economic.    Melissa, what's your idea of the key areas?   MELISSA WORONOFF: Well, I would agree with Jerolyn. I would also add not only race but also class and religion. And I think that's what's great about New York City, but it makes things hard at times. I mean, to get those things to work out, that's really the starting point and then other things will follow.   KEN SHUNG: My concerns with the city have to do with crime. I think the real issue for me is, like, who's raising our kids? When there are two functional parents in the house, then you can maybe have the next generation of people that would want to not resort to crime. I just feel that you've got to start at home. If parents don't spend time with their children, then there's no love. When there's no love, the children don't grow up with any kind of sense of responsibility and moral obligation.   MINTER: I have a concern when I read statistics that come past my desk, that eight out of 10 African-American children are going to be brought up in single-parent families.  What is going to happen to that poor mother who's going out working, trying to support that child. And she has to put that child in a daycare center if she doesn't get home until 5, and that daycare center or that school program is not going to be able to give them the kind of structure that they need. When they look and see Mama struggling to pay the rent and buy food, and on the corner is this drug dealer who has diamonds and is driving cars, what's going to happen? What happens is that person becomes the role model.    WORONOFF: I think it's interesting that there certainly are a lot more single-parent families today. But I think what needs to happen is that both our city and the country need to acknowledge that families are changing and need to accommodate for that, rather than try to change it.   What can the mayor of this city, whoever is elected, do about any of these issues? What are they really responsible for?   MINTER: They're responsible for selecting the people who are going to take care of the various city agencies and monitoring them. I would make sure these people are knowledgeable, decisive, have some humanist to them and are in contact with the needs of the people.   FIELDS: I would fire every single commissioner in the City of New York; that's the first thing I would do. The second thing, I would go to people who have grown up in this city, understand its problems, are not political. I would want my commissioners to be responsible to me, not to the Democratic or Republican or whatever leader placed them there.   MINTER: I have come to realize that in our society we aren't willing to give people time enough to bring about change. You can't come in and change things in four years that have been messed up for the last 12.    FIELDS: Wait a minute, Jerolyn, are you trying to tell me things were messed up in the last 12 years before David Dinkins became Mayor? This Mayor, he has more nepotism than any other mayor in the history of this city. He appoints Joyce Brown deputy mayor -- who happens to be married to Carl McCall, the person the Mayor appointed to the Board of Ed. He appoints Victor Gottbaum to the Board of Ed, and his wife to being Parks Commissioner. I can go on and on and on. I think that this Mayor has shown no leadership. I think this Mayor has gone to traditional clubhouse politics and has not reached out to the community. I think the city was much better four years ago than it is right now.   Who else wants to jump into that?   WORONOFF: I think the country was better off four years ago than it is now. I mean, the economy was better. When the economy goes down, you know, crime does go up. We have more homeless people. Fewer people have jobs; more people are being laid off. I wouldn't place that blame on Mayor Dinkins.   Ken, are you better off than you were four years ago?   SHUNG: Oh, what a question. I guess -- I don't know, I haven't been that alert in the last four years. Do I feel more fear when I walk down the street? I do.    The accusation has been that the Mayor panders too much to blacks. And that Mr. Giuliani has pandered too much to whites. Then the President came in and said that there are too many people in this city who are unwilling to vote for people who are different from themselves, be it because of race or religion.   SHUNG: Anyone who suffers from any kind of discrimination might find truth in that kind of statement. I think people go into the voting booths after all is said and done, and get very tribal and start to, like, push the lever they feel they can identify with.   FIELDS: I think that everywhere you go there are going to be people who are racist. But I think people are concerned about issues. And President Clinton, I thought, made an inappropriate statement which caused the campaign to become even more racially oriented than it is.    What should the Mayor do to build bridges to racial harmony?   MINTER: I believe that Mayor Dinkins has been systematically trying to build those bridges here in New York, initiating programs all the way toward bringing this into fruition.    FIELDS: In reference to Mayor Dinkins's leadership in building bridges, I did not approve of the way he handled Crown Heights. I did not approve the way he handled the Korean boycott. I did not approve of the way he dealt with the Washington Heights situation with the drug dealer, in which my tax dollars were used to bury him. I think when you build bridges, you build them in an objective and corrective manner. I think, unfortunately, in this campaign, no one is building any bridges.   MINTER: In terms of Giuliani, I don't think that he would be building bridges. He has set a tone with his activities that, to me, is negative and divisive. I will vote for David Dinkins, because I believe in his dream.   FIELDS: Well, let me tell you something. I'm not going to vote for David Dinkins. I'm going to vote, this ex-offender, this African-American, is going to vote for Rudolph Giuliani. I think his record in reference to civil rights when he was United States Attorney shows his concern. I don't see Rudy Giuliani as a police monster.   Tell me about welfare.   MINTER: To eliminate the high numbers of people on welfare, you have to improve the economic situation. You have to provide training for people so that they can fit into the economic arena for jobs. For mothers who have to work, you have to provide the services that will care for the child while the mother is in training on a new job. You have pockets of this happening. It's not happening across the board in large numbers because you're looking at money. Where do you get the funding for this?    FIELDS: You've been doing it for 30 years, and it hasn't worked, the social scientist's philosophy. This is this old liberal philosophy that has kept our community behind. We need to inform people very candidly. If you have children out of wedlock continuously, you are going to be punished. We must stop people from having six children from six different fathers.    No. 2, we cannot reward people because of the fact that they do not wish to work. I agree with you, we must provide jobs. But those jobs must be provided with the partnership between private industry and the government. The government cannot continue to absorb and create these make-believe jobs and cost taxpayers more money. Now the welfare system rewards you.    What is it that the mayor can and should do?   FIELDS: He should have an aggressive, aggressive program of finding fathers who are not paying. We need to have these people who are on temporary income maintenance, these Aid to Dependent Children, and these Workfare people actually participate in training and working and placed in private enterprises. We need an aggressive program like that. And Mayor Dinkins doesn't have that program.   MINTER: He has started some of these programs.    FIELDS: He hasn't started -- the only thing he has started is sitting there and playing tennis at Gracie Mansion.   WORONOFF: I would say that as far as welfare is concerned, we need to have programs that fit the people's needs, rather than programs that lead people into who we want them to be. If there are single mothers with children, then we need some sort of daycare for these children while the mothers learn the skills that they need to go out and work. We need support for our community members out there.   We're talking about ethics and values. What can any city administration do to affect values -- let's say, the homeless problem?   SHUNG: Well, those policies should not polarize people and put them on the margins of society. I think people tend to think: \"Well, not in my neighborhood. Or not in my backyard. Or I'll just retreat and it won't happen.\" What happens is, they'll be sitting in a public school, or even a private school. And the child that grew up on welfare, that value system will be in the same classroom as your child who had maybe a nice upbringing, and those values will cross. This is a problem that America has to confront, that our value systems, whether you're rich or poor, and those class distinctions, are eventually going to cross paths.    MINTER: You know, another concern is health care. I think that a lot of women, particularly pro-choice women, may not be inclined to vote for Giuliani, because he has gone back and forth on the issue of abortion. I think that taking a stance on abortion is really taking a stance on women and how highly you value them.    FIELDS: Well, people are going to vote for David Dinkins, who at one time was not pro-sexual preference, and that's become pro-sexual preference.    WORONOFF: I'd also say that Giuliani's issues on homelessness and his 90-day policy is something that people are going to be looking at.    FIELDS: I think what he was talking about was that bureaucracies tend to drag their feet. And what he was saying was, \"Within that 90 days, I want that person placed.\" I think he was using the concept that the Rev. Calvin Butts and the Abyssinian church do in Harlem, that you come to the shelter for a short period of time. And the first day you're there, you begin to look for employment and permanent housing.    Is the city doing enough?    SHUNG: To deal with homeless?  The city is not doing enough. I think I don't even look for Mayor Dinkins to solve the world's problems. I look for him to start moving in the right direction, to build the bridge instead of break it down. . . .    MINTER: I'd like to tell you, I have not voted for Mayor Dinkins because he was black. I voted for him because I thought he was the best person to do the job. I'm proud of him because he happens to be an African-American. I feel that he sets a good role model for African-American children, who can look and say: \"I can aspire, too. And doors will not necessarily always be closed to me.\" But I think he is a man, a human being, trying to do what I would like to see done in this city.   FIELDS: Well, I will tell you, it took a lot for me not to vote for him this time.   Because of race?   FIELDS: Because of race. It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made in my life. . . . You know, it's interesting, because you have such diverse people here. Here I am, supporting a relatively conservative candidate. And here are some of the traditional people who you would think would support a more conservative candidate, supporting a liberal candidate.   And what I'm hearing over and over is that we're all saying the same thing. Who would be the best mayor to take care of the quality of life and show compassion? We're all saying, who's going to show more compassion? All of us sitting here who are employed or have some income are saying we're concerned about those people who can't take care of themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"UNIVERSITY PRESSES;\nThere's Always an Explanation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/university-presses-theres-always-an-explanation.html","abstract":"THE COLUMBIA ENCYCLOPEDIA\nFifth Edition.\nEdited by Barbara A.

Everyone is mad for the Dutch painters of the era -- the soulful Rembrandt with his golden shadows and the light-soaked domestic perfections of Vermeer -- but the Flemish Peter Paul Rubens? His name evokes Church Triumphant martyrdoms, over upholstered female nudes, and epicene monarchs costumed as gods, images that have little appeal in the censorious, secular, anti-everything 1990's.   Yet few paintings visiting this country at present are as captivating as Rubens's \"Garden of Love,\" the centerpiece of an exhibition titled \"The Age of Rubens\" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (through Jan. 2). Many of the characteristic beauties of Flemish Baroque art can be savored in this panoramic image: sensuous figures, neo-classical architecture, acres of marvelously wrought silks and exotic stuffs, putti as plump as pillows, stormy skies and lambent rays of sunlight that speak of the cruelty of time and the triumph of human love.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Prosecuting Bucket Slaying Could Be Tricky, Experts Say","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/prosecuting-bucket-slaying-could-be-tricky-experts-say.html","abstract":"  At the outset, the case against Pedro Jose Gil looked fairly simple.

But for Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, taking the case to a grand jury for an indictment could be turning into something of a tightrope walk. There is a good chance, legal experts say, that rather than indicting for murder, the grand jury could indict Mr. Gil on a far less severe manslaughter charge, potentially exposing Mr. Morgenthau to criticism that he was too easy on the defendant. Mr. Morgenthau also runs the remote risk that the grand jury would not indict Mr. Gil at all.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"A la CarteBay Scallops, a Rare Breed Indeed, Are Making a Return Visit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/nyregion/a-la-cartebay-scallops-a-rare-breed-indeed-are-making-a-return-visit.html","abstract":"  BAY SCALLOPS are small, sweet and special.

Architects agonizing over how to design buildings for today's culturally fragmented public, for example, could do worse than reacquaint themselves with Venturi's concept of the \"difficult whole.\" Unity is not meant to be easy, Venturi proposes, nor is diversity synonymous with distintegration. Difference is as great a civic virtue as justice, faith or grandeur.   And seldom has it been celebrated as delectably as at Stevenson Library, Venturi's new addition to a pair of library buildings at Bard College. The strength of the design is due partly to Venturi's smart solution to a complex problem, but it also owes much to the context he found there. A small school with a progressive reputation, Bard sits high on a bluff above the Hudson River in Annandale, commanding views that have scarcely changed since the days of the Hudson River painters. Its original library, a perfectly proportioned Ionic temple built in 1893, is the ideal architectural accent for this American arcadia.

Translated by Jay Paul Minn, it is a bewitching account of Loti's camelback travels from Cairo to Gaza through the Sinai Desert. Loti (1850-1923) was an atheist who embarked on the trip to heal his spirit by following \"old abandoned trails to Holy Jerusalem.\" (He covered the Gaza-Jerusalem journey in his next book, \"Jerusalem.\") He was often as enthralled with his Bedouin guides in their \"furry rags\" as he was with the sacred landmarks he visited. Similarly, his religious enthusiasm was as much anthropological as spiritual: at a sixth-century Byzantine church, he marvels at the contents of two reliquary chests. One contained \"the mummified black hand of St. Catherine, lying with its rings and bracelets on a silk cushion\"; the other, \"her head, crowned with a tiara of precious stones, an awesome relic framed by quilting and smelling of mummy.\" On the road, the author and his companions meet bandit sheiks, learn to distrust mirages and suffer an attack of longhaired caterpillars.

W. Hayes had to love this. Let the coaches in their short-sleeve shirts draw up their puntrooskies and their pretty pass patterns. In Woody Hayes's Ohio -- and a quarter-century after the last national championship, you better believe it still is -- they build a team the old-fashioned way, for days like this, when the snow blows over a treacherous field even before Halloween.   John Cooper, the beleaguered Buckeye coach with the perfect record this season, has adjusted to life in the 90's with a greater emphasis on speed. But Ohio State's 24-6 victory over Penn State, on a long, gray afternoon for the Nittany Lions in Ohio Stadium, was created with speed made effective by power, the kind manufactured by an imposing offensive line that helped the Buckeyes take a large step toward a return to the Rose Bowl. Big Gap Between Old and New    Ohio State, 8-0 over all and 5-0 in the Big Ten, demonstrated a surprisingly wide gap between itself and the newest member of the conference. The Buckeyes rushed for 224 yards and were led by Raymont Harris, who gained 151 on 32 carries, both career highs. He was the most effective beneficiary of the big men up front: left tackle Alan Kline, left guard Jason Winrow, center Jack Thrush, right guard Dave Monnot and 310-pound right tackle Korey Stringer.   \"We just went and did what we do best,\" Winrow said, remembering the start of the third quarter. \"Run the ball inside the tackle box. We knew we had them where we wanted.\" A 68-yard drive, which Butler By'not'e ended from the 4-yard line, gave the Buckeyes an 18-point lead that was never seriously threatened.   With that line at work under conditions that favor their advantage in power, Harris and the Buckeyes imposed their will. \"I couldn't believe it,\" Harris said when asked about the weather. \"It was like, 'October? Snow?' I knew with the conditions like that, we would run the ball more. I liked that.\"   And the Buckeye defense, led by the relentless Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson, the 300-pound sophomore defensive tackle, transformed the Lions' passing game from an uncertain element of its offensive scheme into a liability.   The combination was overwhelming. Penn State (5-2 over all, 2-2 in the Big Ten) is tied for sixth place. The Lions entered the game with an average of 278 rushing yards a game. Today they were held to 149 yards, including 123 by Ki-Jana Carter, the Columbus-area hero who ran for more than 100 yards for the sixth time this season and became the first to gain more than 100 this season against the Buckeyes. But with his cutback ability diminished by the muddy conditions, and with Penn State's comeback hopes necessitating the pass, Carter gained just 29 yards after halftime and was hardly a factor.   Too many Lions could say that. Quarterback Kerry Collins was 6 for 19 in the second half, and 13 for 39 over all, with 4 interceptions. The Lions were held to 109 yards in the second half and went without a touchdown for the second time in eight games, including the 24-3 Blockbuster Bowl loss to Stanford at the end of last season.    \"We didn't come into this game thinking, 'Wow, this is Penn State, an icon from the past,' \" Harris said. \"Really, they were no more important than Purdue or Northwestern, or any other Big Ten team.\" 5 Penn State Turnovers    Penn State's first defeat on the road to a Big Ten team since the Lions lost here in 1975 came as the result of five turnovers, a blocked field goal, and an inability to take advantage of favorable field position and come from behind in the second half. \"We just did not have good field position throughout the game,\" Paterno observed.   His team's four possessions in the third quarter began at its 46-yard line, and at Ohio State's 44, 44 and 32. The possessions ended with an interception, an unsuccessful fourth-down play from the Buckeye 13, a punt and a fumble.   The result was the type of celebration usually reserved for Michigan victories. \"All I smelled was liquor when the fans went on the field,\" Wilkinson said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"The Irish Make Up For Earlier Lapses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/sports/college-football-the-irish-make-up-for-earlier-lapses.html","abstract":"  For the first time in nearly two years, Notre Dame was trailing at halftime.

Their mission was to make a better world, not better art. As John Reed put it, \"This class struggle plays hell with your poetry.\" They found a haven in the Village, a backwater unaffected by the grid system imposed by city planners on the rest of New York. GREENWICH VILLAGE: Culture and Counterculture (Museum of the City of New York/Rutgers University, $29.95), a fine collection of essays and photographs edited by Rick Beard, a former official of the Museum of the City of New York, and Leslie Cohen Berlowitz, director of the Humanities Council of New York University, examines the peculiar confluence of geography and economics that made the American bohemians feel at home. For example, few thoroughfares linked the Village with the business district to the south or with the flourishing shopping district just north; this preserved the neighborhood's intimate quality. As the essayists -- who include Alfred Kazin, Daniel Aaron and Denis Donoghue -- point out, the anonymous rooming houses and studios offered liberation from conventional restraints. Still, personal relations took a back seat to politics. Village residents expressed outrage at the needless deaths in the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire and were early supporters of the suffragettes. After World War I, many of the original Villagers moved on, the artistic types were shrewd entrepreneurs playing to an increasing tourist trade, and the neighborhood's character remained; the Beat Generation writers of the 1950's hung out in the Village for the same reasons John Reed and Emma Goldman had 40 years earlier.

The images in the show, which focus on the animal's massive size, fanlike ears, huge tusks and wrinkled trunk, take the form of sculpture, masks, headdresses, stools and the prow of a boat. Many of the works incorporate elephant ivory, bone, hair or hide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"A Line of Clothing For the Office","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/style/l-a-line-of-clothing-for-the-office-505993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I appreciated Liz Logan's Oct. 24 article, \"Our Ms. Brooks (Brothers),\" because it focused on a source of comfortable officewear for women.

Of course, on certain religious feast days one can still find Peruvian Indians in the mountains in just such angel costumes (without the rifles), but their predecessors have been preserved in magnificent paintings, reproduced -- along with an astonishing array of art produced in oil, metals, wood and textiles for 300 years -- in CAMBIOS: The Spirit of Transformation in Spanish Colonial Art (Santa Barbara Museum of Art/University of New Mexico; cloth, $50; paper, $25). Two curators of a show organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Gabrielle Palmer and Donna Pierce, give overviews of art in the Viceroyalty of Peru (all of South America except Brazil) and the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Central America, Mexico and parts of the United States). But it is the descriptions of individual works that, taken together, fill one with wonder at the lavishness, vitality and great endurance of the artistic genius that flowed through the old Spanish empire, making the gold and gems Europe fought over seem tawdry in comparison. Mexican painters like Juan Correa and Miguel Cabrera certainly knew contemporary European standards, but their work blazes with light, passion and wisdom that express their own visions of the great civilization rising around them. And the anonymous casters and carvers of silver Peruvian incense burners in the forms of turkeys, peacocks and armadillos knew all that Cellini knew, and more.

Here are several.   Why Police Wear Blue   Q.  What is the history behind the color blue for uniforms for the New York City Police Department? Why was it chosen? A.  The department's official colors are blue, white and green. Blue was chosen as the uniform color largely for practical purposes, said Officer Dominick Palermo, assistant curator of the Police Museum at the Police Academy in Manhattan. \"Sometimes you have to change a flat tire,\" he explained. \"It is much easier to get grease off of blue than white. Also, the color blue has meanings, such as courage and strength.\"   The uniform, modeled after that of the British police, was adopted in 1853. New York officers resisted it at first, opting instead for street clothes and an eight-point star that identified them as police officers, because they thought the uniforms looked too British (not such a popular group in New York at that time). On the Beam   Q.  What is the purpose of the big point at the top of the Empire State Building? A.  The top part of the \"point\" is an antenna used by 13 major FM radio stations as well as Channel 41, a Spanish-language television station. The tippy-top of this antenna transmits the Home Shopping Network's signal. Map Help   Q.  Why is it that even though 12th Avenue and the Henry Hudson Parkway connect, they still remain separate streets on maps of the city? A.  Lisa Daglian, spokeswoman for the City Department of Transportation, says the Henry Hudson Parkway is also known by three other names south of 57th Street: West Street, West Side Highway and 12th Avenue. The map you have may be trying to let you know that and telling you to look for signs accordingly. A Lot of Tokens   Q.  How much does it cost to run the New York City subway system? A.  Some $2 billion a year, with half from fares and half from government subsidies, which the Transit Authority began receiving in 1964. Cabby Specifications   Q.  What type of training do New York cabdrivers need and what type of license are they required to have? A.  All New York City taxi drivers -- there are now 40,000 -- must be at least 19 years old and \"proficient\" in English, hold a valid driver's license from any state, have a good driving record and be felony free. They must get a license from the Taxi and Limousine Commission ($62) and go to taxi school for 20, 40 or 80 hours, depending on their language skills and knowledge of city geography. No More Duck Intrigue   Q.  I am reading \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" which poses the intriguing question that no one really answers -- where do the ducks in Central Park go during the winter, or does someone take care of them there? A.  About 15 types of waterfowl pass through Central Park during the year. Most migrate south, but many Canada geese and mallards stay all year, fending for themselves or relying on the kindness of strangers. Ebbets Neighborhood   Q.  What section of Brooklyn was Ebbets Field located in? A.  Ebbets Field was built in 1913 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, so desolate at the time that the area was also known as Pigtown, Goatville, Tin Can Alley and Crow Hill. Ebbets Field's first game, an exhibition match between the Dodgers and the Yankees, was that same year. Man on a Horse   Q.  On 59th Street by Central Park is a statue of a golden man on a horse. Who is he and what is he pointing at? A.  The statue is of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman with Victory, dedicated on May 30, 1903.   In fact, he isn't pointing, Victory is. But the way it was designed by the sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, their motions are meant to look as one, according to \"Manhattan's Outdoor Sculpture\" by Gayle Cohen (Prentice Hall, 1988).   The statue had lost its golden sheen over the years, but around 1990 the Victorian Society in America spiffed it up. As for whom or what Victory is pointing at, Abbey Lavine, a reference assistant at the New-York Historical Society, said, \"Well, at whatever Victory would be pointing at.\" JENNIFER STEINHAUER","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"35 Years With Woodrow Wilson: The Journey of a Long-Distance Editor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/university-presses-35-years-with-woodrow-wilson-journey-long-distance-editor.html","abstract":"  ON March 4, 1913, Woodrow Wilson was sworn in as President of the United States. Eighty years later to the month, Princeton University Press published the final narrative installment of \"The Papers of Woodrow Wilson,\" a 69-volume documentary record of Wilson's life and work. None of these elegant-looking books (each one of which costs $65) has ever appeared on a best-seller list; none is likely to turn up on the shelves of your neighborhood bookstore any time soon. Yet some 95,000 individual volumes have been sold since 1966, when the first one appeared. Virtually every American library owns a set, as do hundreds of other libraries around the world (there are at least two sets in Moscow.) Initially subsidized by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, \"The Papers of Woodrow Wilson\" long ago began to turn a handsome profit for Princeton. In fact, the publication of the Wilson papers is probably the biggest success story to date in the little-known branch of historical research known as documentary editing.   The publication of large-scale documentary editions like \"The Papers of Woodrow Wilson,\" which make essential primary manuscript sources readily accessible to historians everywhere, is one of the most important jobs done by America's university presses, and one of the most unglamorous. Documentary editing projects, like dissertations, have a way of dragging on forever; many actually outlive their original editors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"POSTINGS: With a Show of Photos from New Book; Landmarks Group Plans Forum On Preservation Pros and Cons","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/realestate/postings-with-show-photos-new-book-landmarks-group-plans-forum-preservation-pros.html","abstract":"  On April 19, 1965, Mayor Robert F.

You can be forgiven for thinking the main thing that has divided the incumbent Mayor, David N. Dinkins, and and his Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, is whether George J. Marlin, the Conservative Party candidate, should have been included in their debates. But as the chart at right shows, there are some real distinctions between the men who would be Mayor. At the same time that you are being asked to decide who should spend the next four years in City Hall, you will get to weigh in on whether eight years in office is enough for anyone. If it is approved, ballot proposal No. 4 would force candidates who win on Tuesday and are re-elected in four years to be out by 2001.

For more than a decade, she has insisted on seeing herself as a classical choreographer -- working with ballet companies, hiring ballet dancers for her own group and making increased, if often inverted, use of the classical ballet vocabulary. Yet she has never accepted the codified classical idiom as a given. At heart, she remains rooted in a modern-dance mentality. That is, she's more interested in exploring new movement than in accepting a single vocabulary as a creative premise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"The Imaginary Woman","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/the-imaginary-woman.html","abstract":"LIAISON By Joyce Wadler.

Here are several.   Why Police Wear Blue   Q.  What is the history behind the color blue for uniforms for the New York City Police Department? Why was it chosen? A.  The department's official colors are blue, white and green. Blue was chosen as the uniform color largely for practical purposes, said Officer Dominick Palermo, assistant curator of the Police Museum at the Police Academy in Manhattan. \"Sometimes you have to change a flat tire,\" he explained. \"It is much easier to get grease off of blue than white. Also, the color blue has meanings, such as courage and strength.\"   The uniform, modeled after that of the British police, was adopted in 1853. New York officers resisted it at first, opting instead for street clothes and an eight-point star that identified them as police officers, because they thought the uniforms looked too British (not such a popular group in New York at that time). On the Beam   Q.  What is the purpose of the big point at the top of the Empire State Building? A.  The top part of the \"point\" is an antenna used by 13 major FM radio stations as well as Channel 41, a Spanish-language television station. The tippy-top of this antenna transmits the Home Shopping Network's signal. Map Help   Q.  Why is it that even though 12th Avenue and the Henry Hudson Parkway connect, they still remain separate streets on maps of the city? A.  Lisa Daglian, spokeswoman for the City Department of Transportation, says the Henry Hudson Parkway is also known by three other names south of 57th Street: West Street, West Side Highway and 12th Avenue. The map you have may be trying to let you know that and telling you to look for signs accordingly. A Lot of Tokens   Q.  How much does it cost to run the New York City subway system? A.  Some $2 billion a year, with half from fares and half from government subsidies, which the Transit Authority began receiving in 1964. Cabby Specifications   Q.  What type of training do New York cabdrivers need and what type of license are they required to have? A.  All New York City taxi drivers -- there are now 40,000 -- must be at least 19 years old and \"proficient\" in English, hold a valid driver's license from any state, have a good driving record and be felony free. They must get a license from the Taxi and Limousine Commission ($62) and go to taxi school for 20, 40 or 80 hours, depending on their language skills and knowledge of city geography. No More Duck Intrigue   Q.  I am reading \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" which poses the intriguing question that no one really answers -- where do the ducks in Central Park go during the winter, or does someone take care of them there? A.  About 15 types of waterfowl pass through Central Park during the year. Most migrate south, but many Canada geese and mallards stay all year, fending for themselves or relying on the kindness of strangers. Ebbets Neighborhood   Q.  What section of Brooklyn was Ebbets Field located in? A.  Ebbets Field was built in 1913 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, so desolate at the time that the area was also known as Pigtown, Goatville, Tin Can Alley and Crow Hill. Ebbets Field's first game, an exhibition match between the Dodgers and the Yankees, was that same year. Man on a Horse   Q.  On 59th Street by Central Park is a statue of a golden man on a horse. Who is he and what is he pointing at? A.  The statue is of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman with Victory, dedicated on May 30, 1903.   In fact, he isn't pointing, Victory is. But the way it was designed by the sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, their motions are meant to look as one, according to \"Manhattan's Outdoor Sculpture\" by Gayle Cohen (Prentice Hall, 1988).   The statue had lost its golden sheen over the years, but around 1990 the Victorian Society in America spiffed it up. As for whom or what Victory is pointing at, Abbey Lavine, a reference assistant at the New-York Historical Society, said, \"Well, at whatever Victory would be pointing at.\" JENNIFER STEINHAUER","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931031","headline":"Lyrics Grew on Plum Trees","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/31/books/lyrics-grew-on-plum-trees.html","abstract":"  SEEDS IN THE HEART Japanese Literature From Earliest Times to the Late Sixteenth Century.

But when it comes to campaign contributions many influential people have decided to play it safe and give to each side, campaign records show.   Some contributors call it hedging their bets.

But the upshot is that scores of contributors have insured that they will be in the winner's corner, no matter who wins on Tuesday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New
