The move will come in President Clinton's detailed budget request, expected to be made public the week of April 4, said George Stephanopoulos, the chief White House spokesman. How Congress will respond and how hard Mr. Clinton will push the issue are still unclear, say lawmakers and legislative analysts on Capitol Hill. Abortion foes say they believe they have a good chance of blocking the President. Signal of Deep Change    For all the uncertainties, Mr. Clinton's decision to seek the repeal of the 16-year-old Federal prohibition, the Hyde Amendment, which applies to the Medicaid program for poor people, is a sign of the sea change in abortion politics. Both sides of the abortion issue predict that the next six months will test old positions, longstanding alliances and the power of the abortion-rights movement under a friendly Administration.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930330","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-90233664294.html","abstract":"Muslims in America Regarding the report \"U.S. Makes an Arrest in Tower Bombing\" (March 5):.

The evolution of larger brains, more efficient metabolisms and more elaborate social systems all seem to support the conventional wisdom that complexity increases during evolution. So clear is the trend that some biologists suggest that the evolutionary process is actually driving the increase in complexity, pushing the upper limit of life's intricacies ever higher.   But in two of the first studies to measure these trends, based on mammals' backbones and fossil shells, researchers say they have been unable to detect any overall evolutionary drive toward greater complexity, at least over periods of tens and even hundreds of millions of years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930330","headline":"Doctor Recounts Threats By Farrow Against Allen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/nyregion/doctor-recounts-threats-by-farrow-against-allen.html","abstract":"  A clinical psychologist testified yesterday that she warned Woody Allen that she feared for his safety because of threats made by Mia Farrow.

It has long been assumed that the continents float on the underlying rock, just as an iceberg floats in water.

After contemplating their expressionless faces, the camera returns to the drama, but detachedly, as though the director has decided to observe the world and its butchery through uncomprehending bovine eyes.    Wielded by a lesser film maker, this conceit, which alludes to the eye-slashing opening sequence in \"Un Chien Andalou,\" the seminal 1929 Surreal collaboration between Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, might seem pretentious. But \"Cows\" is a film so overflowing with what can only be called life-force energy that these digressions lend it an extra depth and poignancy.

If I catch the squirrels that have taken over my bird-feeder and take them to the woods several miles away, will they make it back to my yard? In other words, do squirrels have a homing instinct?     A. \"They do have such an instinct,\" said John C. Muir, an urban geographer who is executive director of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment in Prospect Park. \"It is not well understood by science, but they will often return several miles.\"   As an example, he described an informal experiment at his own institution, which conducts extensive environmental education programs for school children and adults.   Some years ago, he said, a classroom in the park's Picnic House was invaded by squirrels that would distract the children. \"You have never lived until you have dealt with hundreds of fourth-graders, at the most inopportune time, aroused by cries of 'Rat! Rat!' \" he said.    So the center trapped the squirrels alive and transported them as far away as the Dyker Beach Golf Course near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which is about seven miles away from Prospect Park, as the crow flies.   \"We got a chance to know these squirrels intimately,\" he said, \"and there is no doubt that the same ones were back in three to four days.\" They had somehow found their way for more than seven miles, through urban backyards and busy streets, to their preferred habitat. Water With Meals    Q.    My grandmother used to say you shouldn't drink water with your meals, only afterward. Is there any reason for this?     A \"Physiologically, it can't make any difference at all,\" said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairman of the department of nutrition, food and hotel managment at New York University.    The water is absorbed by the body, she said, just as the body absorbs the significant proportion of food itself that is water. The only real difference is that water takes up space in the digestive tract that could be occupied by food.    \"Many diet plans suggest drinking huge amounts of water with food,\" she said, to provide extra bulk and keep the person from eating to excess, but she said that most people's calorie-control mechanisms quickly compensated for such attempts to outsmart them.   \"It is funny how the advice has shifted,\" she said. \"People eat so much more now that I guess you can ascribe it to the shift from nutritional deprivation to nutritional excess.\"     Readers are invited to submit questions about science to Questions, Science Times, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

So why would an American playwright be so rude, let alone unfashionable, as to disinter the rotten corpse again right now?   Lanford Wilson has his reasons, and they may not be the ones you expect, in \"Redwood Curtain,\" his first play since \"Burn This\" five seasons ago and his most powerful since \"Talley's Folly\" in 1979. This work, a Circle Repertory Company production at the Brooks Atkinson Theater on Broadway, is set mostly among the towering redwoods in Northern California where untold thousands of Vietnam veterans have disappeared into a feral, ghostly existence, their only contact with civilization an occasional visit to town for an odd job or a meal scarfed from a garbage can. But Mr. Wilson has not written another melodrama in which a crazed Vietnam vet refights the war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930331","headline":"The Blame for Empire's Mess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/31/opinion/the-blame-for-empire-s-mess.html","abstract":"  Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has run up huge losses, provided poor service to some large corporate clients, spent millions on perquisites for its top officials and handed lucrative contracts to directors and other insiders.

The commercial insurers blame mismanagement by Empire and loose supervision by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, Salvatore Curiale.

The other is a Butoh dancer, Min Tanaka. He is seemingly clad in layers of clay, wearing a stiff earthen mask, miming the doomed ruler's every gesture or enacting his history in formalized gestures. He is a lifesize puppet, a mirror of Oedipus, the Theban king who is himself a sort of puppet, forced into a tragic snare set by the gods.    But as the horrifying truth of Oedipus's past comes to light, the clay shell around Mr. Tanaka is shed, leaving a vulnerable, nearly naked man: the only human figure free of elaborate costume and cosmetic trappings in the entire film. He who has been so blind to himself blinds himself. We see shredded strips of blood-red ribbon hanging on his face. Groping, with a blank stare, he stumbles under the scaffolding and ramps that compose the somber stage set, until he is walking knee-deep in a pool of dark water, surrounded by ghostly figures. The chanting of the chorus has come to an end. We watch the water dripping from above, then hear the sound of cleansing, pouring rain.

Dedicating itself noisily to the Year of the Woman, this year's show missed no opportunity to emphasize Hollywood's feminine side, no matter how misconceived that opportunity might be. There was, for instance, a quickie tribute to \"93 winners or nominees written or co-written by women.\" But as luminaries were seen entering the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the background music was \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls.\"   The show was determined to honor women as sanctimoniously as possible, provided it could retain the usual quota of dancing girls. (A writhing-cheesecake presentation of the Oscar-winning song from \"Aladdin\" suggested that the film's teen-age lovers had wandered into a bordello.) And the prevailing tone of condescension was established early on. \"Women have always made vital contributions to movies,\" intoned the academy's president, Robert Rehme, who pointed out that this year 36 women were nominated in 12 categories. \"That's not equality yet, but it's progress,\" he insisted as the audience offered weak applause.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930331","headline":"Review/Recital; The Bringing Together Of Poet and Composer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/31/arts/review-recital-the-bringing-together-of-poet-and-composer.html","abstract":"  In the best moments of her recital on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall, Renee Fleming illuminated that undefinable space between a song's text and its music where emotional connections are made that transcend both elements. This kind of communication has to do only partly with vocal quality and technique, although it undoubtedly helps to begin with an attractive sound and to know how to use it. The magic, though, is in discovering the chemistry between the poet and the composer and then adding the personal resonance that makes the singer seem an indispensable part of the amalgam.    Miss Fleming achieved that in several of the songs she offered. In Brahms's \"Lerchengesang,\" her smooth, slightly dark, gracefully weighted tone was ideal for the mystical imagery of Carl Candidus's text, and there was artfulness and subtlety in the way she shaped the lines, particularly ascending figures that tapered to a sweetly produced pianissimo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930331","headline":"Jets Are in Quandary Over 2 Defensive Ends","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/31/sports/football-jets-are-in-quandary-over-2-defensive-ends.html","abstract":"  It seems unlikely that Reggie White, the Eagles' defensive end and premier free agent, will make a decision before tomorrow on which team he wants to play for.

Wolford made $700,000 last year; Kelly makes $2.864 million a year.   Ralph Cindrich, Wolford's lawyer, negotiated a deal with the Colts over the weekend that included this clause tied to the team's record: He would be paid at least as much as the Colts' highest-paid offensive player.   Wolford then took that offer, which calls for Wolford to average $2.6 million a year over three years, and showed it to the Bills, who had seven days to match it. But the Bills' highest-paid player on offense happens to be Kelly, the quarterback hauling down an average of $2.9 million a year. Did this mean the Bills would, in order to match the Colts' deal, have to pay an offensive lineman as much as their star quarterback?   The league yesterday said no. Cindrich said yes.   The league's management council and the Players Association will fight it out before an arbitrator at a hearing tomorrow.   \"If this is disallowed, it's discrimination against offensive linemen,\" Cindrich said.   But that wasn't the only flurry of N.F.L. activity yesterday. In addition, the Cleveland Browns reunited those former University of Miami quarterback rivals, Bernie Kosar and Vinny Testaverde, by signing Testavarde as a backup for what the Browns described as a one-year deal plus an option year.   The 29-year-old Testaverde had wanted a $2 million-a-year deal. He is believed to have signed with the Browns for a base salary of about $1.4 million this year. The contract is heavily laced with options that could swell to more than $2 million.    Art Modell, the Browns' owner, said the team doesn't expect to move on Carl Banks, a linebacker who two years ago asked the Browns to make a deal for him with the Giants. Banks still expects to leave the Giants, and Alan Herman, his agent, said he expects at least one club to make an offer early next week. Since Banks is a transition player, the Giants would be entitled to match that offer and retain him. Coach Dan Reeves says the Giants will compete with any offer he receives.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"For Yanks and Mets, a Day to Wince at Pitching","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/sports/baseball-for-yanks-and-mets-a-day-to-wince-at-pitching.html","abstract":"  One day after the Yankees finally settled on their starting rotation, it was cast into potential doubt today when Melido Perez injured his left leg running to first base against the Atlanta Braves.

The settlement, expected to be announced within days, concludes a class-action suit brought by 17 families in Yonkers whose rent is federally subsidized under a program known as Section 8. The case is separate from the long-running desegregation battle that centers on where to build new public housing in Yonkers. Limits on Minority Population    The 17 families contend that, since the program began in 1974, they and 1,500 other families were steered by county and municipal housing offices into a rundown black and Hispanic section of southwest Yonkers, violating anti-discrimination laws.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930401","headline":"Missing Suspect Charged In Trade Center Bombing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/nyregion/missing-suspect-charged-in-trade-center-bombing.html","abstract":"  A missing sixth suspect, described by investigators as a 25-year-old taxi driver born in Iraq or the United Arab Emirates and apparently in the United States illegally, was charged yesterday in the World Trade Center bombing.

First seen deflecting the catcalls of leering fisherman and fighting bitterly with her parents, Ingalo (Solveig Arnarsdottir) soon finds herself in difficulty. After starting a brawl in a local dance hall, she is sent from her rural home to a clinic in Reykjavik for observation. A doctor there, having considered the effects of Ingalo's childhood head injury and her penchant for physical attacks, pronounces the patient \"a selfish bastard.\"   At the clinic, Ingalo meets a fellow patient (Thorlakur Kristinsson) and has a quick affair that is no less brutalizing than her other experiences. Dismissed by the man who seduced her, she returns to her small town, only to run away from home. Ingalo, along with her brother Sveinn (Haraldur Hallgrimsson), joins the crew of the very same fishing boat whose workers eyed her in the film's opening scene.

But it was only under prodding by Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa that the Muslim Brotherhood today condemned attacks against tourists and Government officials. Police State or Civil Unrest?    The confrontation signals the administration's resolve to curtail or shut down any Muslim group that appears to be politically inclined.
