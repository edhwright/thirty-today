Hill & Wang, $25. \n\nIn 14 years of environmental reporting at The New York Times, Philip Shabecoff saw American environmentalism rise and fall and rise again. He met colorful characters from James Watt, Ronald Reagan's fundamentalist Interior Secretary, to David Brower, the grand curmudgeon who brought the Sierra Club to political life. On his beat the world reached an agreement to save the ozone layer and the Audubon Society fought about keeping the egret as its symbol.\n\nRecognizing how crucial the experience of the American land has been in shaping American environmental thought, Mr. Shabecoff begins his book with an east-to-west eagle flight over the continent as it would have appeared at the time of Columbus 500 years ago: occupied by natives, but virgin to a European eye, and blessed with passenger pigeons, buffalo, pristine waters and unbelievable riches in timber, minerals and soil.\n\nThe story continues through the Lewis and Clark expedition, through Daniel Boone, John James Aububon, Emerson, Thoreau and George Perkins Marsh in Woodstock, Vt., setting down in the 1860's the first principles of sustainable resource management. There is the strange association of President Theodore Roosevelt with Gifford Pinchot, the forester, and John Muir, the mountain man, whose interacting passions produced the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the preservation of Yosemite Valley as a national park and the flooding of Hetch Hetchy Valley, Yosemite's twin, to provide water and power for San Francisco. Already the battle between development and preservation was joined.\n\nThere is a parade of personalities: Rachel Carson, William O. Douglas, Lois Gibbs, the embattled housewife of Love Canal, and Aldo Leopold, the ecologist and game manager who appears to be one of the few people able to embrace both sides of the use-it-conserve-it dilemma. Mr. Leopold gave Mr. Shabecoff his title, in a passage that describes his own ecological conversion. \n\nSome years ago Mr. Leopold and some friends had found a mother wolf with her cubs and had shot them. \"We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce, green fire dying in her eyes,\" Mr. Leopold recalled in his book \"Sand County Almanac.\" \"I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes -- something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch. I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean a hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.\"\n\nMr. Shabecoff throws in this quote without connecting it to his title, but his position is not that the fierce, green fire of American environmentalism is dying. Rather, he sees it surging up and down in waves, three so far: first, the Roosevelt-Pinchot conservation movement of the early 1900's; second, the burst of landmark environmental legislation around the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, and third, the professionalism and pragmatism of the present.\n\nHis last chapter offers advice for the fourth wave. Get political, Mr. Shabecoff says. We have green publications, green technology, green products. Now we need green politics.\n\n\"To make the political breakthroughs necessary to achieve their goals,\" Mr. Shabecoff writes, \"the environmentalists \n\nmust \n\nmake common cause with other sectors of our society that have a stake in changing the political and economic status quo.\" That alliance is natural, he points out, when you look to see who gains from polluting, and who gets polluted. He makes the interesting observation that \"the Black Caucus . . . has the best voting record, year in and year out, on environmental issues of any interest group in Congress.\"\n\nIt's too bad that Mr. Shabecoff's courageous advice comes at the end of his book, not at the beginning, and that the early parts of the book are written in a plodding style that may not carry readers through to the end. Mr. Shabecoff admits that he is a journalist, not a historian. Until he gets to history that he himself witnessed, he does not make his story come alive. It's as if he were working through a list of names and ideas that need to be mentioned, describing each one dutifully, but rushing to get to the good stuff: the Reagan Administration and Anne Gorsuch Burford, the Bush promise and disappointment. He doesn't even tick off the history list in chronological order, so one can get confused about whether Barry Commoner might have been influenced by Rachel Carson or vice versa.\n\nThere is one more problem with this book, one that might have arisen from 14 years of environmental reporting under constant pressure to be objective. Mr. Shabecoff lets his bias loose in this book. Too loose. There are too many preachy sentences about \"the urbanized, overcivilized materialism that is engulfing late 20th-century America\" and about human beings having \"for the first time . . . the ability to make the world uninhabitable for their own species.\"\n\nIt would have been better to tell the story of the settlement and degradation of a glorious continent, of political corruption and senseless waste of resources and of the eloquent voices raised against that folly, and to let readers come to their own conclusions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930311","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/11/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-961993.html","abstract":"  Ngoc Lam and Que Lam Music of Vietnam Metropolitan Museum of Art    Vietnamese music, as played by Ngoc Lam and her daughter Que Lam on Sunday afternoon, is a sphere of pristine melodies, openwork counterpoint and an occasional delicate swirl.

Her beheading still strikes terror into the hearts of those who witnessed the rise and empowerment of the Nazi regime, which reached its height of brutality in those days of 1943 and 1944, when its leaders realized the war was lost. Stalingrad had just become the nemesis of the Eastern front, and the air bombardment of German cities had begun, bringing home that the supposed invincibility of the German Reich was a myth.   Mildred Harnack-Fish, I presume, was married to the son of Dr. Adolf von Harnack, the theologian and humanist, once director general of the Prussian State Library and president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (after World War II, the Max Planck Institute). Adolf von Harnack was a scientist of great distinction, who represented the best of German culture and thinking. It is no wonder that in such an environment as the young Harnacks lived, Nazi ideology kindled active resistance.   Almost concurrent with Mildred Harnack-Fish's death, Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl, brother and sister students at the University of Munich, were executed at Stadelheim Prison in Munich. They and several more students and a professor were members of the White Rose, a secret society whose main sin had been to print and distribute leaflets and other material to appeal to the conscience of academic circles in Bavaria and to counter the lies of German victories on the many war fronts.    These young people, like the July 20, 1944, resistance group, were victims of the Volksgerichtshof (the People's court) under Judge Roland Freisler. All were condemned to death. Luckily for Freisler, he died in an air raid, instead of at the Nuremberg war crimes trials, where he belonged.

Jagr had two goals and won it by tipping in Larry Murphy's slap shot from the right point at 3 minutes 18 seconds of overtime, but this was a night for the National Hockey League's two biggest stars to stage one of their rare head-to-head shootouts.

Gucci, which is better known for its shoes and handbags, made a surprisingly strong case for its ready-to-wear. And there was hardly time to assimilate these well-presented messages before Gianfranco Ferre triumphantly closed the week of fall fashion shows today.   The cool professionalism of a master tailor like Armani is always a pleasure. He did not bother to tinker with proportions or decorations. Jackets just slid over the body in a gently fitted line, accompanied most often with easy, comfortable-looking trousers. Colors were mild, with the emphasis on honey shades and light browns. Traditional patterns like checks and herringbones had a pale subtlety. Occasionally, a short vest with a rounded hem peeped from under a jacket. A massive necklace was sometimes worn on the chest, but there was no other jewelry, not even earrings. It was simply the apotheosis of the pants suit as the basic daytime look for the woman of today.  Doing What Works Well    The designer tried a few long, full skirts with his well-cut jackets, and they seemed to work well. Then he gave the suit a dressier tone by adding a touch of metal to the material and a big printed silk shawl edged with fringe to the shoulders. That was fine, too. So were the suits with a gentle ruffle down the inside of the front closing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"Review/Art; Fast Rise, Lasting Role Of a Gentle Giant","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/arts/review-art-fast-rise-lasting-role-of-a-gentle-giant.html","abstract":"  THE angelic-looking Max Ernst, who died in 1976 a day short of his 85th birthday, may have been the gentlest of the giants of 20th-century art. The often compelling, sometimes revelatory exhibition of Ernst's early years at the Museum of Modern Art, the first major examination of the artist's work to be held in New York City in nearly 20 years, confirms the German-born Surrealist as an astoundingly inventive, even protean artist.   Beginning with two derivative yet beautifully colored Cubo-Futurist compositions and several examples of a touchingly sweet, emotionally dark Expressionism, the show follows Ernst's rapid development from 1912 to 1927 through 170 works in painting, drawing, prints and most of all collage. A pioneer of Dada and Surrealism, Ernst helped divert Cubist collage, which was implictly abstract, into Dadaist territory in 1919, fusing unrelated images into recognizable yet hauntingly unfamiliar realities. Inspired by the dreamscape that Giorgio de Chirico opened for exploration just before World War I, Ernst then began converting these collages into paintings that helped form the basis of Surrealism, the art movement that his friend Andre Breton erected on the ashes of Dada in Paris in 1924. Without the monumental hybrid creatures of Ernst's 1921 paintings \"Celebes\" and \"Ubu Imperator,\" without the mutant plants and jewel colors of his stratified collage landscapes or the reconstituted academic figuration of \"The Tottering Woman,\" with its machine-clad 19th-century circus performer seen against a crystalline blue Northern Renaissance sky, the Surrealist work of Magritte, Dali and Tanguy is virtually unimaginable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"House, Like Senate, Votes To Ban H.I.V.

Last week the British advertising magnate went on a shopping spree. The day before an exhibition opened at the Anderson O'Day Gallery in West London, Mr. Saatchi bought out the entire show, five abstract paintings by an unknown 32-year-old British artist named Simon Callery. The works were priced at $:4,000 and $:5,000 each, and Prue O'Day, an owner of the gallery, said Mr. Saatchi spent $:20,000, or about $29,000. Mr. Saatchi first saw Mr. Callery's work a month before, at a new artist's space near King's Cross in London called Cubitt Street Studios, where he bought an abstract landscape painting.   Such sprees are nothing new for Mr. Saatchi. But just as fast as he buys many works by a single artist, he has been known to sell them, sending prices on a rapid roller-coaster ride. This fickle behavior is a subject of great interest to gallery owners, artists, auction-house experts and collectors, who keep close tabs on Mr. Saatchi's dealings because he has been known to inflate an artist's reputation and then deflate it in short order, all single-handed. For example, in the 1980's Mr. Saatchi bought, in bulk, the work of the Italian artist Sandro Chia, and then, shortly after, he sold the work and Mr. Chia's prices tumbled. They have never quite recovered.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"How Many Sexes Are There?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/how-many-sexes-are-there.html","abstract":"  Western culture is committed to the idea that there are only two sexes.

Legally, too, every adult is either man or woman, and the difference is not trivial. It means being available for, or exempt from, draft registration, as well as being subject to laws governing marriage, the family and human intimacy.   But if the state and the legal system have an interest in maintaining a two-party sexual system, they are defying nature. For biologically speaking, there are many gradations running from female to male; along that spectrum lie at least five sexes -- perhaps even more.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930312","headline":"Restaurants; In Morningside Heights, quality outrides many changes.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/arts/restaurants-in-morningside-heights-quality-outrides-many-changes.html","abstract":"  The Terrace restaurant, high above 119th Street at Columbia University in Morningside Heights, seemed a likely victim for the harsh recent recession.

The previous Met production of \"Ariadne,\" which was 26 years old when last done in 1988 (it can be seen on Deutsche Grammophon laser disks), was a straightforward, blunt staging of this peculiar opera.

His major contribution as a composer has been an ever-evolving technique of electronic-music performance.   On Saturday night, Mr. Tudor introduced a new electronic system designed especially for him: the Neural Network Audio Synthesizer, a fearsomely complex apparatus that processes analog signals through something called a \"neural network chip.\" The composer had available a variety of pre-taped segments, which he modified by the flicking of cryptic switches.
