The women's team led at the start of the 18.5-mile race off San Diego. The boat, skippered by J. J. Isler at the start, and later by Leslie Egnot, led six other cup yachts. But at the fourth mark in the six-stage race, John Bertrand, skipper of One Australia, passed America . A 17-knot wind, far brisker than the 5-6 knots that prevailed at the first two races of the championship, made the fight for first place all the more dramatic. One Australia crossed the start line prematurely, and had to re-round. In the meantime, America  was off to a clean start, well ahead of One Australia on the right side of the course. After finally passing America , Bertrand found himself in a tough tactical battle, having to jibe back and forth to hold his slim lead in the fifth leg.

It was generous music, with an abundance of harmonizing voices and deftly deployed horns. But it couldn't stand up to the corrosive 1980's, when best-selling black pop polarized into bare-bones, confrontational hip-hop or plush come-ons.

defendants. Unlike most cities, New York contracts the work to a private organization, the Legal Aid Society. Despite a history of dedication to an often thankless job, the society has grown fat with age. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has correctly chosen to pare the fat. That will cause the society financial pain. But it may also bring about new ways of dealing with the city's immense criminal caseloads and better justice at lower cost.    Two factors moved the society into the Mayor's line of fire. One was the city's budget crunch. The other was the society's foolish two-day strike in September. The strike, which Mr. Giuliani halted with a threat to fire the society, strengthened his hand just at budget time. Now he calls for a cheaper system -- $12.5 million less than the current budget of $79 million -- and a modern legal services contract to replace the one first signed in 1966.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE : Il Mostro","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/style/IHT-the-movie-guide-il-mostro.html","abstract":"Il Mostro.

The show, organized by the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Manitoba, brings together 14 Latin American artists, several of whom have shown in New York. They are an eclectic bunch, often thought-provoking, in one case genuinely exciting. But neither the specific works nor the essays in the show's vague, buzzword-filled catalogue suggests why they were deemed suitable company.   Given the lack of a unifying theme, one is left to judge the artists one by one, and generally speaking, the lighter their touch the better they look. It's refreshing to encounter a political metaphor as understated as Maria Fernanda Cardoso's \"Flag,\" a checkerboard pattern of guava candies forming an emblem both sweet and insubstantial, or to find gender issues as deftly explored as they are in the work of Jose Leonilson, whose crudely sewn dresses and wall hangings stitched with provocative inscriptions are \"women's work\" quietly in revolt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Jury Recommends Death Penalty for Abortion Foe Convicted in 2 Killings in Florida","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/us/jury-recommends-death-penalty-for-abortion-foe-convicted-2-killings-florida.html","abstract":"  A jury recommended today that Paul J.

His signature style is the clear-sighted film that serenely explores emotional and social upheavals, like \"Diary of a Country Priest,\" the 1950 tale of a quiet priest's religious crises. \"The Devil, Probably\" is a late, little-known Bresson film that takes the same calm approach to a world crumbling from the inside out. The film was shown at the 1977 New York Film Festival, then virtually disappeared from the United States until today, when it begins a weeklong run at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.    The film, set in contemporary Paris, begins with a newspaper account of a young man's suicide, then flashes back to the final six months of his life. Charles is 20 and in despair over a meaningless life.

Even as polls of American Catholics show deep dissent from his positions -- a 1992 poll, for example, showed that 67 percent favor opening the priesthood to women -- John Paul II remains hugely popular. Why? Various explanations have been offered. He is charismatic, and a master of the world tour and the vast open-air Mass.

Kubrick's chilliness remains every bit as disturbing as the threat of nuclear war, but it also inspires awe. So does the fact that with a fastidiousness some of his own characters might have appreciated, Mr. Kubrick has rephotographed every frame of this film with a Nikon camera to create a mint-condition print for its 30th anniversary.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Redistricting Heats Up Election Races; 2 Margins of Error","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/opinion/l-redistricting-heats-up-election-races-2-margins-of-error-728241.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In this final week of the 1994 election campaign I would beg the media to stop using two misleading phrases when presenting poll results.

Expansions have been rewarded at the polls in years of high growth: 5.3 percent in 1964, 5.4 percent in 1972, 7.8 percent in 1984. No such good year has occurred this time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Fuss Over Photos of Mitterrand's Other Child","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/world/fuss-over-photos-of-mitterrand-s-other-child.html","abstract":"  Breaking a French taboo on press revelations about the private lives of public figures, Paris-Match magazine published photographs today of a young woman whom it described as President Francois Mitterrand's daughter, who was born out of wedlock.

VIRGINIA -- Two new polls show that the race for Senate in Virginia is still unsettled in the final days and Senator Charles S. Robb may be gaining ground. Both suggest that the Democratic incumbent has overtaken his Republican challenger, Oliver L. North, but the leads are within the statistical margin of sampling error. The surveys were conducted by the Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research company and the Virginia Commonwealth University. Scott Keeter, a director of the Virginia Commonwealth poll, said that the most notable difference in the last two polls was a decline in the percentage of voters who said they trust Mr. North to tell the truth -- from 37 percent last month to 26 percent this time. One explanation, Dr. Keeter said, could be Nancy Reagan's comment last week that Mr. North \"lied to my husband and lied about him.\" MICHIGAN -- Detroit's largest black-owned newspaper, The Michigan Chronicle, has sent shock waves through state political circles by endorsing Gov. John Engler, a conservative Republican, for re-election on its front page. While polls have shown Mr. Engler far ahead of his challenger, former Representative Howard Wolpe, the Governor has been even less popular than most Republicans among black voters. Indeed, he received only 13 percent of the vote in Detroit in 1990.

Eldridge of Manhattan as chairwoman of the Council's Contracts Committee and to strip her of the $5,500 stipend that goes with the position.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/arts/art-in-review-728128.html","abstract":"  Susan Rothenberg   Sperone Westwater  142 Greene Street  SoHo  Through Dec. 17    These are the latest of Susan Rothenberg's nominally abstracted paintings inspired by New Mexico, where she has lived for several years. Their palette is mostly red, yellow and white -- bone-dry colors -- and the objects that float in them, like astronauts drifting in space, include a hawk, a skull, rocks and horses. As always with Ms. Rothenberg, the surfaces consist of heavily scumbled lines that can occasionally seem like so much wasted energy but that mostly give the paintings an all-over buzz and a certain raw beauty that evokes the raw beauty of the landscape.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/arts/art-in-review-728136.html","abstract":"  Jane Hammond   Jose Freire Gallery  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through tomorrow    For the last six years Jane Hammond has made paintings using a repertory of 276 appropriated images and six predetermined colors, with mostly deadly results, but her recent paintings are starting to shed their visual stiffness. Her compositions are looser and more casually layered, her surfaces brushier, her palette less emphatically limited. Her images, often used more sparsely or on canvases shaped (a little like Elizabeth Murray's) to suggest hands, feet or open books, interact more suggestively.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Raise the Hurdle for College Athletes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/opinion/raise-the-hurdle-for-college-athletes.html","abstract":"  People who worry about education -- and how colleges exploit athletes without providing it -- will find some alarming news in \"The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams,\" Darcy Frey's new book about the sports obsession in America's poorest neighborhoods and public schools.

Tommy, who lives with his widowed mother (Patti Allison) and dour brother (Neal Jones) in a working-class neighborhood, is the highly symbolic main character in Kenneth Branagh's socially pointed melodrama \"Public Enemy,\" which is having its American premiere at the Irish Arts Center.   The play, which predates the films directed by Mr. Branagh, takes place in the mid-1980's, when the strife in Belfast was worse than it is today. One way Tommy has avoided being caught up in the warfare that divides the city is by spinning a fantasy of himself as a latter-day Cagney character. In the play's opening scene, he wins a talent contest in a bar by doing an impersonation of the Hollywood legend singing and dancing \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" But it quickly becomes clear that Tommy's identification with Cagney is more than a crowd-pleasing daydream. It is an obsession that has spun dangerously out of control.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Article 726389 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/arts/article-726389-no-title.html","abstract":"  The history of Chinese food in New York is filled with as many embraces and betrayals as a prime-time soap opera. First came the Cantonese-style Chinese-American dishes that were staples for decades: pepper steak, shrimp with lobster sauce, fried rice. Then New Yorkers began a torrid affair with the spicy Sichuan cuisine, which arrived in the late 1960's and early 70's.   Alas, the institutionalization of Sichuan food bred boredom, and culinary wanderlust struck again. A return to Cantonese, perhaps, with its noodle and dumpling specialties? A flirtation with Fukienese, a dalliance with Shanghaiese? And then maybe even a return to Sichuan?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19941104","time":"1994-11-04

More than 30 young men and women took part in the writing group, and for our final project I asked them to discuss issues that directly affect their lives. Here are some excerpts. Keep Positive I am 90 percent African-American. My desires and my goals are to be a choreographer, an actor, a singer, a writer, a model, an African-American activist. To keep myself motivated, I pick role models. I put inspiring themes on my bedroom wall. To be positive, you have to think positively. I am determined. I know times are going to be hard. I know I have strikes against me. I have come a long way. I want to take further steps.   Being a teen-ager and black in the world today is very hard. You never know what's going to happen. We live in a world of racism, hate, prejudice and other problems. Today for me and for others we need more racial pride and more racial identity. You Can't Win P eople think that because I take Ritalin my brain is messed up. Just because I handle things differently and my thoughts might be on another cloud from yours does not mean I'm messed up in the head. To me life is just a game you can't win. Why can't you win? The answer is clear to me: you are not supposed to win because the object is not to win. The object is just to play for fun.   I could never express myself very well through words -- that's why I turned to music to show other people how I feel. Other people never really get my ideas though.   When I look at the world today, I see hunger, pain, misery, drugs and crime. Making a Future People call me C-Dog. I have been to hell and back. I have been shot in the leg. I could have died. I have been to every school in Rochester. My mother and I have been through some tragic things. My father died when I was 11 months. My life was going downhill, but I'm in a comfortable school now, and I'm about to try and turn my life around. My mother works two jobs. I'm still alive. I want to go to college.   The real issues in the world today are crime, guns, us, our community. I know why people are killing each other. People are killing each other because they don't have a future. People live on the streets today, and no one cares about them.   Ever since I was in third grade I was a follower, but now that I have seen what is going on in the world I strongly believe I can be a leader. It's hard. I have to keep on pushing myself. I want to graduate and make my family proud, and most important I want to make myself proud.   -- Collice, 17 I Prefer Animals I am a very polite person. I like to practice different languages. My favorite music is jazz. I like pop and blues, too. I spend most of my time working at my house. I like to play basketball in my backyard or play football in the street. I am not a perfect person, but who is? I like animals better than humans. At times an animal is my best friend. My favorite subjects in school are science and social studies. I like everything that is natural.   Lately I have been thinking about the way drugs go around. I think people should go to church and put their money in church instead of drugs or cigarettes. Most people today are greedy, and that's why I do not care for money. Animals are not greedy. Animals are not wasteful.  -- Patrick, 15 One Dream I want to make it in the world. Maybe I can be an actor or a singer. I want to be somebody for my people. When I get older I want to do something that nobody can do but me. This is my one dream.   I have learned that if you want something in this world you have to take the initiative and work to the best of your ability. One other thing I have learned is that I am no different from a grain of sand on the beach.   Attitude I could care less about being on an honor roll. At this school before lunch we have 10 minutes of free reading. I have started a book. I have enjoyed reading the book. I am getting toward the end, and I don't like the thought of coming to the end of the book.   My favorite kind of music is heavy metal. My favorite group is Slayer. I think a lot of my attitude comes from the music I listen to. I'm not saying music gives me a bad attitude -- just sometimes music goes with the mood.   The most important thing in my life is my family. At this time in my life my family is having a lot of problems. My family puts a lot of pressure on me, and right now I'm trying not to let that bother me too much.   Childhood Walking through the outside air, the cold spring is all in my hair. It is dark. It is wet. It is gloomy. The ground is wet and soggy. It is like I am dark and secluded, not in a violent sense, in a sad sense. I like to sleep. Sometimes I wish I would never wake up. I want to sleep under water. My wish is to be blind and deaf so I could never see or hear the wrong doing.  Childhood brings memories. I lost my childhood the day I was born. I was always on my own. Maybe in some way I was happy as a child, not in the sense of anyone being nice, but in the sense of so much happened.   -- Jason, 16 Face It Drugs, crime, drugs are everywhere today. People fight and kill and hurt others for a buck. It is hard trying to make it in this lifetime. I don't believe drugs and crime will stop. Today we have to learn to live with murder, rape, robberies, fights. We have to learn to deal with them. We have to stop turning our heads the other way.
