The slobbish Vinnie baits Carter as much with what his ex-wife describes as the \"apologetic menace\" in his voice as by what he says.

The trade association, joined by six other food-industry and supermarket groups, has filed suit to stop the Agriculture Department from testing ground beef for E. coli bacteria that are responsible for as many as 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths a year.   The contamination occurs when a cow's intestinal or fecal matter comes into contact with muscle meat during unsanitary slaughter. Ground beef poses a special hazard because the grinding process spreads the contamination throughout the product. Proper cooking will kill the bacteria, but many people have grown used to eating their beef rare or raw.

The worst part was that I had to work it into the essay section. They had a section for listing family members who had gone to Harvard, but that was only for immediate family members. It was 3 o'clock in the morning and the application was due next day. So I started writing something dumb about my intellectual development -- or was it my personal growth? -- all the time saying to myself, \"I can't, I can't,\" when suddenly out of the blue came, \"As I was having dinner last night with my first cousin once removed, Robert Lowell, the poet, I turned to him and said. . . .\"   That was a long time ago, in 1969, and it is just as well to make a clean breast of it now. Also, I might just as well admit that I do not get poetry. In high school I was good at subjects like \"The Culture of Poverty\" and \"The Negro,\" but when it came to analyzing those poets, forget it. To this day, put a gun to my head and I still cannot tell you the difference between the tone of a poem and the mood of a poem. Still, I did not lie on the application. Bobby -- Bobby is what we called him in the family -- had been out to Concord the night before. (Concord, Mass., is where I grew up, under the influence of the writings of Louisa May Alcott -- my mother said there was an excruciating period when I called her Marmee and helped with the dishes every two seconds.) Bobby came out to visit my mother whenever he was teaching at Harvard. They were first cousins, and Bobby had been reading her his poems ever since they were teen-agers summering at Rock. They got along great, although neither of them probably understood a word the other one said. My mother is very pretty and very normal, and she believes in treating other people as normal even if they're not.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"LONG ISLAND GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/nyregion/long-island-guide.html","abstract":"FREE CHOICES\n\n TODAY In the 1950's, when they were starting their careers as entertainers, Laura Manning and Florence Reid of Westbury and Joan Brooks of Glen Cove appeared as a trio.

His gifts were immediately recognized by the likes of Carl Van Vechten and Frank Crowninshield, and he soon found work doing caricatures and illustrations for Vanity Fair and other leading magazines. Gallery shows, book publication and commissions for set designs followed. Rosa Roland was a celebrated dancer and choreographer when Covarrubias met her, but by the time they married in 1930, she had left the stage. A striking beauty photographed by, among others, Edward Weston and Cartier-Bresson, she became an accomplished painter, photographer and cook. In COVARRUBIAS (University of Texas, $29.95), Adriana Williams, an independent scholar, chronicles the lives and times of Miguel and Rosa Covarrubias with a veritable torrent of names, places and events. Most of the notable artists and intellectuals from the 1920's and 30's seem to have crossed their paths, either in New York, on their travels, or in Mexico City, where they moved in the mid-30's. Their wide range of friends included Al Hirschfeld, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera and John Huston. Covarrubias was fascinated by the ethnic roots of culture and eager to experience authentic forms of dance, music and art before they were lost to the leveling effect of modern life. This passion not only enriched his art -- from the Harlem drawings to his murals for San Francisco's 1938 international exposition -- but also led to books on Balinese culture and the archeology of Mexico. Ms. Williams has not worked this rich material into an authoritative biography, but the abundant information she has gathered should serve future biographers well.

The Cosmati, named for Cosma, the oldest and most active of the group, were a medieval cooperative of stonemasons and sculptors that created a dazzling inlaid marble and glass technique. For over 100 years, it captured the markets and made them the most sought-after church decorators in Italy.\n\nThe Cosmati recycled marble fragments from ancient ruins and combined them with cubes of colored glass to produce intricate geometric patterns saturated with the blood red of imperial porphyry, the dusty yellow of antique giallo and the elegant gray-green of serpentino. With these they decorated everything from cloister columns to candleholders. But it was their floors that were the talk of the medieval world, so much so that from the 12th to the 13th centuries, churches in many parts of what we now know as Italy rivaled one another in the splendor of their Cosmatesque floors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"Residential Resales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/realestate/residential-resales-853496.html","abstract":"  In the following reports, the \"listed at\" price is the asking price when negotiations began that ended in the sale.

Unafraid of boring his audience with scenes in which little seems to happen, the Polish director of brooding, haunting films like \"The Double Life of Veronique\" (1991) and \"Decalogue\" (1988) deals in emotional nuance and unspoken dialogue in the increasingly marginalized tradition of Robert Bresson and Ingmar Bergman. Mr. Kieslowski continues this tradition in \"Red,\" the widely praised finale to his \"Three Colors\" trilogy, which opens in New York on Wednesday.   Meeting with a group of American journalists during the Cannes Film Festival last May, Mr. Kieslowski, 53, projected the bookish intensity of an Eastern European auteur. He sported a buzz cut (perhaps to hide an incipient baldness), glasses and a leather jacket. Though his English is serviceable, he preferred to speak in Polish, through a translator, in effect adding another protective layer.

In each of his novels he has created figures who stand starkly silhouetted against a vast, harsh landscape and an equally harsh political system; they are belittled and dehumanized by both. His prime concern has been with survival, spiritual and physical, the scraping of meaning and sustenance from the most hostile of environments. There is no comfort to be had from this experience; for Mr. Coetzee's characters, to be conscious is to suffer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"TODAY'S SECTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/us/today-s-sections.html","abstract":"  Magazine/Section 6   A special issue of the Magazine asks \"What's New York the capital of now?\" It's a city in which density is destiny.

That is the inevitable question posed by \"Frank Sinatra Duets II,\" the follow-up to last year's \"Duets,\" which became the singer's best-selling album ever when he was 78. The answer is a highly qualified yes. Once again, Mr. Sinatra displays a punchy (but sometimes punch-drunk) aggressiveness as he recapitulates past triumphs joined by guests who vocally stretch themselves to fit a classic pop mode.    The first album was a conceptual and technological landmark in its teaming of Old Blue Eyes with rock and soul singers like Bono and Aretha Franklin in versions of classic performances that retooled the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle, Don Costa and other Sinatra arrangers. The fact that the singer and his partners sounded as if they were sitting side by side, even though they had recorded their parts separately, made the feat all the more astounding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941120","headline":"All Aboard: Big East Is Switching From the Local to the Express","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/sports/college-basketball-preview-all-aboard-big-east-switching-local-express.html","abstract":"  Three new coaches, each of whom loves to run on offense and press on defense.

Except for the loss to George Mason in the 1985 championship game, North Carolina has captured the title every year since the N.C.A.A. instituted the women's tournament in 1982. After a fairly close game before intermission, the Tar Heels erupted for four goals in the second half to hand Notre Dame (22-1-1) its only loss of the season.

As he told ABC on Sunday, he may block the trade accord unless the Administration swallows a cut in the tax on capital gains -- the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments.   Mr. Dole's behavior mirrors what the electorate decisively rejected two weeks ago: politicians who say they stand for one set of principles but act according to another. The Republican Party has proudly put the U.S. in the forefront of nations negotiating for open trade and investment. Mr. Dole supported past free-trade pacts because he recognized that they contributed mightily to world growth.
