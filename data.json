As television has taken over our culture, most of us have come to treat it much as we treat our parents: as a force that is always there, is often distracting, but rarely commands our undivided attention. The museum, where television is an object of research, even reverence, isn't about such heedless intimacy.

Mr. Pena, a Spanish flamenco guitarist whose exceptional virtuosity is matched by his passion, will present his Gypsy folk Mass, Misa Flamenca, a work that melds the Roman Catholic liturgy with flamenco traditions. In the work, which was created for the Wroclaw Music Festival in Poland, the Gloria has become a fandango and the Eucharist an alegria. The concert will feature Mr. Pena's Flamenco Company, an ensemble of guitarists, vocalists and percussionists, and the Andalusian flamenco dancer Javier Cruz. The Elmer Iseler Singers, a Canadian group, serves as chorus. Show time is tomorrow at 8 P.M., and tickets cost from $23.50 to $25.50.

Among the high points of her new act are a rendition of Laura Nyro's \"Sweet Blindness\" in which she sprawls across the piano in a delirious fog of Southern moonshine and a version of Bob Dylan's \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" that gets to the song's chilly, contemptuous essence like no one else's.

For those who have a taste for such things, Film Forum 2 is offering a program of six animated short films by the Quays, which opens today and plays through Thursday. They range from a recent music video for the singer and songwriter Michael Penn, to \"Anamorphosis,\" a formal examination of perspective in 16th- and 17th-century paintings.   Timothy and Stephen Quay, identical twins who were born in Philadelphia and now live in England, are masters of an eclectic Eastern European mode of Surrealism. Their most experimental films re-imagine the world as a waking nightmare experienced in mysterious, frequently decrepit settings. The puppet figures in a film like \"Street of Crocodiles\" (1986) bob and lurch through spaces so dingy and encrusted with age that they conjure up images of an anguished collective memory, buried but still stirring under a mountain of detritus.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930409","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/09/arts/art-in-review-123093.html","abstract":"   Joan Mitchell   Robert Miller Gallery  41 East 57th Street  Manhattan  Through May 8    This is among the most beautiful gallery shows in a long while and a fitting tribute to one of the leading second-generation Abstract Expressionists. Joan Mitchell died of lung cancer in Paris in October, at the age of 66. These are her last, radiant paintings, remarkable in their diversity of touch, magisterial in their scale and authority. In \"Phyllis,\" the only work on view from 1991, not 1992, Mitchell paints in broad, almost blunt strokes that seem to be pushed and pulled across the canvas. In other paintings, she draws in thin, elegant lines bunched like tangles of streamers, or in bold vertical lines that evoke tall grasses. As free flowing as her paintings can appear, they have about them an extraordinary harmony and structural solidity; they are often in two panels joined together, each panel with its own character and yet inseparable from the other. There is even, in what may be the most comprehensive and brilliant of these paintings, \"Ici,\" a loose grid that binds together the complex jumble of lines and joyously colored patches.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930409","headline":"Cuomo Urges Product-Liability Revisions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/09/nyregion/cuomo-urges-product-liability-revisions.html","abstract":"  In an effort to protect manufacturers from exorbitant legal judgments, Gov.

While polishing the play, he has also put it in context, having added a related one-act, followed by a brief epilogue. The result is a pungent chamber trilogy of character sketches.   In the play, at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II, the principal character is careering through a crisis.

In his current show, at the Pace/ MacGill Gallery, Mr. Witkin deploys his now familiar style in works that range from the cloyingly sweet to the truly terrifying. In \"Satiro, Mexico,\" a man is dressed up as a satyr, complete with furry legs and hooves and with little horns sprouting from his head. But the silliness of this image is given a sharp twist by the fact that the man has no arms, an aspect that Mr. Witkin, in a typically histrionic gesture, emphasizes by ringing the places on the man's torso where his arms should be with crowns of thorns.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930409","headline":"CHANGE UNDER WAY AT ENERGY DEPT.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/09/us/change-under-way-at-energy-dept.html","abstract":"  Seeking to streamline her department, the new Energy Secretary isreversing some organizational changes that her predecessor made to improve nuclear safety, provoking a vituperative fight and the resignation of a top official.

While this analysis is common among both European citizens and a growing number of Americans, it is flawed.   Even if one accepts the wisdom of military action in this crisis, it is unrealistic to expect the European Community to take charge of such an operation. National governments and national foreign policies are still in control of Europe's foreign policy and have determined Europe's actions toward the former Yugoslavia.    The Community has so far been given almost no power in foreign policy. The European Community commission, the Community's executive authority, has only an advisory role in foreign policy making, and even when the 12 European Community countries try to act together, any member state can veto action.   Perhaps more significant, the European Community countries have no command system for joint military operations outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And Germany, the biggest member state, refuses to send its army outside Western Europe. Imagine what United States foreign policy would be like if it had to depend on the unanimous agreement of 50 governors!   Europe's weakness in the Yugoslav crisis has exposed not the failure of the Community, but the need for it. Europe's national governments have shown themselves incapable of moving beyond narrow national interests to the more global outlook that they could have if their sovereignty was pooled together. The dream of united Europe is not dead, but it risks getting prematurely buried under faulty explanations and exaggerated expectations.  MARK M. NELSON Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for Intl.

The President and the majority in Congress are not only from the same party but on the same wavelength.

Her name was omitted from this article, as it has been for years by textbooks, nonfictional publications, Watson and Crick's scientific manuscripts and, ironically enough, \"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA\" by James Watson.   Rosalind Franklin was a dedicated scientist working at the King's College laboratory in London in the 1950's, along with Maurice Wilkins, recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology. While there she experimented with X-ray crystallography techniques on deoxyribonucleic acid and used these patterns to decipher the structure of DNA. As James Watson and Francis Crick were struggling with the idea of a triple helical structure, Rosalind Franklin found that DNA was a double helix with the sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside, contradicting Watson and Crick's ideas. In February 1953, Watson came to Franklin's laboratory and asked Maurice Wilkins if he could see the X-ray film patterns. Without asking her permission, Wilkins agreed to show him, and it was this secret information that aided Watson and Crick in their discovery of DNA's structure.

At once glittering and provocative, it is a genuine landmark event, bringing together some 300 of the premier paintings and drawings by Venetian masters of the 16th century and by artists outside Venice who came under their spell.   The story of Venice's rise to artistic prominence during the 1500's has often been told, but it cannot be told too often. For the achievements of Titian, especially, marked a watershed in the history of painting. The show is aptly named: until he was done in by the plague in 1576, at about the age of 90, Titian had a dominating place in the artistic landscape of the 16th century not unlike the one Matisse has occupied in ours. Titian's masterly effects of light, the richly textured surfaces of his late works, his noble and psychologically penetrating portrait style, and his ability to evoke, in the same painting, both intimacy and grandeur, set the pace for countless artists for the next several hundred years. All across Europe and well into the 1800's, from Rubens and Velazquez through Delacroix and Turner, painters felt compelled to respond to the art of Titian and to the accomplishments of other masters of the 16th century that are on view here.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"ART;\nAncient Chinese Tomb Sculptures as Appeasers of the Spirit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/nyregion/art-ancient-chinese-tomb-sculptures-as-appeasers-of-the-spirit.html","abstract":"MORE than 40 years ago, Lillian Schloss and her late husband, Ezekiel, of New York City began collecting ancient Chinese tomb sculpture.

Valentia Island, just south of Dingle, leaves the mainland and its more urgent rhythms behind. Its cliffs and blunt hills, its quiet roads and irregular patches of farmland, stretch out into the disorderly winds of the open sea. \n\nLess than a quarter of a mile of water separates Valentia -- just 21 square miles -- from mainland County Kerry at the harbor's narrowest point. But as you cross the bridge over Valentia Harbor from Portmagee, there's a distinct sense of partition, of leaving behind one ethos and entering another. Part of the sensation comes from the fact that the bridge lies at the far end of the island, nine miles west of the mainland's heavily trafficked Ring of Kerry. The sensation increases as you sit at the crossroads on the island side on a hill above the bridge. Behind you is a low green mainland valley bounded by hills and bluffs stretching toward the ocean; to your left is Valentia's rising headland, and beyond it, the Atlantic; to your right, a road that wanders toward the island's two main villages, Chapeltown and Knightstown; ahead of you, farmland that climbs the hillsides.

In Virginia and New Jersey, the National Rifle Association recently suffered two defeats in quick succession against state legislatures; this surprised many on both sides of the gun control issue, because the N.R.A. has long been considered politically invincible, an impermeably strong lobby. \n\nIn Virginia, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder pushed the State Legislature to pass a law limiting the purchase of handguns to one a month; in New Jersey, the Legislature, under pressure from Gov. Jim Florio and a groundswell of public opinion, voted unanimously not to overturn the state's ban on assault weapons. Now the issue of gun control is heating up in Connecticut. Legislation banning both assault weapons and the inexpensive handguns known as Saturday night specials has emerged intact from the General Assembly's Public Safety Committee and will be taken up by the Judiciary Committee at a public hearing tomorrow. Assault weapons have become especially vulnerable to tighter controls because they are popular with gangs and drug dealers and are widely believed to have no legitimate civilian purpose, legislators say.\nA Coalition Gears Up\n\n A new gun control group, based in Fairfield County but hoping to become statewide, is also gearing up for the state's battle over gun control. The Connecticut Coalition Against Gun Violence says its short-term goal is really quite simple: \"This bill, this year,\" said Carol Leighton of Fairfield, the coalition's co-chairwoman. \"We want a statewide ban on assault weapons and Saturday night specials passed this year by both houses of the legislature, and signed by the Governor.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Where Are the Italian-Americans?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/books/l-where-are-the-italian-americans-137093.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   What a shame that in his welcome essay on the scarcity of Italian-American fiction writers, Gay Talese does not consider the missing literary voice of  Italian-American women.

Its name is French for beautiful marsh, and for all the world it would seem to belong on the Normandy coast. From a distance you can see the graceful curve of its small harbor repeated in an arc of stone town houses just beyond the sea wall, with a cluster of neat sailboats moored offshore. A tantalizing, rounded turret rears up in the background.\n\nThis is the look I remember of seaside towns in Normandy, and it was the Normans who gave Beaumaris its name, though they had to come a long way from home to do it. Beaumaris, or Biwmares, as it is spelled in Welsh, lies on the eastern shore of the Isle of Anglesey, which is 20 miles wide by 22 miles long, just off the coast of North Wales. To reach it you must cross the Menai Strait, a narrow channel of sweeping tides and treacherous sands, squeezed dramatically between dissimilar shores: on the mainland the immense mountains of Snowdonia fold in and out of the sky; to the west Anglesey lies low, like a great, green pool of earth slipped from the foothills. Leaning into the wind on the sea wall in Beaumaris you can look back across the strait and feel safe, ringed away from the world by mountains more fortresslike than the elegant 13th-century castle just down the street, also called Beaumaris. Yet here in the heart of Welsh-speaking Wales, this town with a French name and its Anglo-Norman castle are reminders that the world long ago found paths over and around the mountains to Anglesey. The Normans and the English came as conquerors, as did the Romans, though since the Middle Ages travelers have been traipsing across the island in more peaceable pursuit of the ferry to Dublin.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Every Breeze Seems to Whisper Langer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/sports/golf-every-breeze-seems-to-whisper-langer.html","abstract":"  On a windswept afternoon when the holes at the Augusta National seemed to grow smaller, Bernhard Langer pulled off a destiny-evoking shot among a host of pyrotechnics today to take a commanding lead into the final round of the 57th Masters.

It might occur during the second encore at a Springsteen concert or nearing 4 A.M. on a downtown dance floor; at these moments, transcendence comes with an air of spontaneity, no matter how carefully orchestrated the circumstances. To actively seek some sort of nirvana (remember when it used to be a state of consciousness, not a band?) seems silly to the ranks of skeptics and hedonists that make up pop's hippest ranks. Enlightenment is iffy business, at least it was until raves brought young scene makers into a brand-new age.   Tipping its stocking cap to psychedelia, the English-borne dance movement known as rave encourages a belief in the possibilities of mind expansion through electronic beats and synthesized hallucinogens. On the dance floor, the quest resembles the dervish's twirl into frenzy. But even the most energetic ravers sometimes need a break and seek a space where their mental journeys can follow a less physically demanding path. This need has resulted in the establishment of chill-out rooms in clubs as well as the closest thing in years to a fashionable form of meditative music -- ambient house.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/nyregion/westchester-guide-912493.html","abstract":"  SERIES ON RELIGIONS   Religion in the context of American democracy is the focus of four lectures to be given at Manhattanville College on Wednesday evenings under the umbrella title of \"Religion in the New World Order.\" Peter Gardella, associate professor of religion, will give the first talk this week on \"Evangelists of Democracy.\"   \"Islam and World Peace\" will be discussed on April 21 by James Edward Jones, who is also an associate professor of religion at the college.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington offered an illuminating mini-survey of French dance. The focus was on four modern-dance troupes, the Ballet du Rhin from Alsace (in an 18th-century reconstruction of the quintessential French ballet \"La Fille Mal Gardee\") and the Paris Opera Ballet. The latter turned out in full might with Rudolf Nureyev's staging of \"La Bayadere\" plus a mixed bill intended to show off a specifically French repertory.   Such programming suggests that French dance is split down the middle between establishment troupes and dissenters. It might be relevant, then, to recall the analysis that Francois Goguel, a French political scientist, applied to French society as a whole. France, he wrote in the 1940's, was perennially divided by the forces of movement and order. This division, however, was not simply synonymous with the political left and right, since the parties on either side could often advocate social change or the status quo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"A Chorus of Moral Voices","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/books/a-chorus-of-moral-voices.html","abstract":"THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY\n\nRights, Responsibilities,\nand the Communitarian Agenda.\nBy Amitai Etzioni.\nIllustrated. 323 pp. New York:\nCrown Publishers. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930411","headline":"Public & Private; The Good Guys","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/opinion/public-private-the-good-guys.html","abstract":"  Before another television talk show hands out money to chat with the members of the Spur Posse, the lowlife band of high school jocks who measured their own self-worth in terms of how many meaningless sexual encounters they'd had, the people who produce and host the shows should acknowledge something about their guests.

(Cornell University, $14.95.) Nervous disorders seem to be a peculiarly American malaise. Tom Lutz shows how a constellation of symptoms ranging from insomnia to hot flashes became classified as \"neurasthenia,\" an illness that had a broad impact on our 20th-century culture. In 1991 our reviewer, Michael Vincent Miller, praised the writing as \"witty, concrete, gossipy and intellectually pluralistic.\"   FORTUNATE LIVES, by Robb Forman Dew. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Martin and Dinah Howells seem fortunate in every way: they live comfortably in a New England college town with their daughter, Sarah, and son David, who is about to leave for his freshman year at Harvard. But his leave-taking stirs up memories of the couple's other boy, Toby, who died in an accident, and the summer becomes a time when the family's bonds are tested. \" 'Bittersweet' is one of the best words for parenthood . . . and it is perhaps the right word for this novel,\" Ron Carlson said here last year. Harper Perennial has also reissued Ms. Dew's first novel, DALE LOVES SOPHIE TO DEATH ($10), which introduced the Howells family. In 1981 our reviewer, Katha Pollitt, said the rewards of the novel, which won an American Book Award, are \"quiet but rich, and prove once again that in fiction there are no automatically compelling subjects.

Although it has enjoyed a secure place in rock's instrumental arsenal since the days of Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, it has never entirely shed its highbrow aura. And for reasons that have a lot to do with the music's macho rebel side, rock has yet to spawn a keyboard hero with the Dionysian mystique of Jimi Hendrix or the godlike one of Eric Clapton.

The issue was not how democracy could be fostered in Russia, but whether Japan would be able to use the visit to press Moscow to return a group of islands seized at the close of World War II.   The chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, first said the territorial issue would not be raised, since the point of the meeting is to provide financial support for the programs of the beleaguered Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin.

Vaccines contain a microorganism or virus in a weakened, live or killed state, or proteins or toxins from the organism. In stimulating the body's adaptive immunity, they help prevent sickness from an infectious disease. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, herd immunity results. Herd immunity protects those who may be immunocompromised and cannot get a vaccine because even a weakened version would harm them. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the elimination of diseases such as polio and tetanus from much of the world. However, some diseases, such as measles outbreaks in America, have seen rising cases due to relatively low vaccination rates in the 2010s – attributed, in part, to vaccine hesitancy.
