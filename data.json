Since 1976, when his first album appeared, Mr. Parker has built a dedicated following with songs that lash out at hypocrisy and smugness. He arrived just before punk-rock as part of England's pub-rock movement, which valued the craftsmanship of 1960's soul, folk-rock and country music; his rage never tore apart his songs. And through most of the last two decades, he has been articulately snarling at everyone from estranged lovers to unthinking consumers.    But on Friday night, Mr. Parker had more affectionate tidings. \"People think I'm filled with hate/ They've got it wrong, that's out of date\" he sang in \"Pollinate,\" from his new album, \"12 Haunted Episodes\" (Razor and Tie). One love song proclaimed earnestly, \"You're my partner for life\"; another insisted, \"I am undoing this cruel stage that I've been going through.\" From his older material, he chose some of his more atmospheric, less combative songs, in gentler new arrangements: \"Fool's Gold\" changed from a march to a waltz. For most of the new songs, he strummed an acoustic guitar, and he didn't mind singing 'la la\" choruses; his new band, the Episodes, would rather lilt than pound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950403","headline":"1920: Luxury in the Air : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/opinion/IHT-1920-luxury-in-the-air-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"NEW YORK - Coast-to-coast air service, furnishing a flight from New York to San Francisco in 36 hours, travelling by day in a comfortably appointed, chair- equipped cabin, and riding at night in Pullman-like berths, is to be a reality early next July, acc","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950403","headline":"Sports of the Times; Arkansas-U.C.L.A.: A Championship That Deserves the Name","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/sports/sports-of-the-times-arkansas-ucla-a-championship-that-deserves-the-name.html","abstract":"  BASICALLY, the Final Four boils down to this for me: The attraction is not the fanfare, not the idea of \"being there.\" I like championship things.

On Sunday, about 100 of their spiritual descendants ventured back in time, making a pilgrimage to the places the congregation has called home: from that first humble site at Grand and Clinton Streets, to the current Synagogue Emanu-El at Fifth Avenue and 65th Street, on the corner where the Astor Mansion once looked onto Central Park.

FOR SOME FANS, PEACE TINGED WITH ANGER   In the dust and dirt of a city playground, pure baseball is played without hot dogs, heroes or joyless thoughts of Major League squabbles. After a season without a World Series, the sandlot is one of the only retreats for fans and players who confess that they feel more loyalty to a scuffed and battered baseball than to the men who throw them. Not even the talk of a baseball settlement brings peace. C2. REGION  MURDER TRIAL SET IN JORDAN   A Jordanian-American who confessed to strangling his wife in her New Jersey apartment after a fight over their two children is scheduled to go on trial in Amman, Jordan, on Monday for murder. Mohammed Ismail Abequa, 46, was arrested in Jordan, where he had fled with his daughter and son shortly after the July 4 killing. He has been in custody since then. Mr. Abequa will be tried by a three-judge, no-jury criminal court on charges of premeditated murder and kidnapping. B5. A NEW AUDIENCE FOR BASKETBALL   It was a typical gathering of basketball fanatics: tortilla chips and bean dip, a mammoth television broadcasting the game, and feverish fans whooping their devotion. But these were not baritone-voiced fans cheering on slam-dunking players. They were sisters rooting for their undefeated University of Connecticut women's basketball team -- graceful athletes who have become role models for girls across the state, capturing the hearts and minds of a normally untapped audience. B5. URBAN RENEWAL SPURRED BY DYNAMITE   They once represented the promise of urban renewal. But two buildings in the Christopher Columbus Homes in Newark have been turned to dust, a symbol of well-intentioned housing policies turned bad. The Newark Housing Authority dynamited the two long-vacant high rises to make way for new homes at the site.

That removed a big barrier to House passage of the tax bill later this week. The dissidents had held the bill hostage for two weeks, obliquely threatening to block a final vote on it unless they were guaranteed that Congress would not rush tax cuts into law and then renege on its promise to cut spending as well. The accord yesterday gave leaders assurance that their five-year, $189 billion package of tax cuts would pass an increasingly skeptical House. HEALTH INSURANCE DEDUCTION -- The Senate agreed to extend a tax deduction for health insurance for self-employed workers. The measure, contained in a House-Senate conference report, cleared the Senate by a unanimous voice vote and now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. The measure would allow an estimated 3.2 million self-employed people to deduct for tax purposes 25 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. MEDICARE -- The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in 2002, the Clinton Administration told Congress. The annual report said that Medicare's hospital insurance program was now \"severely out of financial balance\" and that there was an urgent need for Congress to address the problem. But it recommended no specific measures. POLICY ON HOMOSEXUALS -- Gay-rights advocates, senior military officers and even some Republicans expressed surprise at Speaker Newt Gingrich's assertion that Congress would try to undo a two-year-old compromise policy on homosexuals in the military. \"This certainly isn't a part of the Contract With America,\" said Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican on the Armed Services Committee. \"We firmly believe there is not a problem with the existing law.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950404","headline":"Man Pleads Guilty in the Kidnapping of His Boss","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/04/nyregion/man-pleads-guilty-in-the-kidnapping-of-his-boss.html","abstract":"  First, there was the Fermin Rodriguez who worked behind a sewing machine for eight years, making pants for tuxedos.

The view that emerges is of a city of seven million in deep trouble, gritting its teeth and refusing to despair. The drivers include a teacher, an economist, an actor and a policeman.

But as the return of John Corigliano's \"Ghosts of Versailles\" showed at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night, history just helps strip away the accidents of a work's origins. In this case, the Met was unveiling its first new work in 24 years at the much-anticipated 1991 premiere. \"Ghosts\" was an American opera that was energetically determined to entertain. John Conklin's astonishing sets had an immediate impact. And this novel work somehow managed to encompass campy parody and sentimental nostalgia while provoking analysis and reflection.    Now, three and a half seasons later, the work is a repertory piece, released on video and scheduled by the Chicago Lyric Opera for next season. The opening-night audience may not have cheered as it did at the premiere, but listeners were certainly entertained and, according to the Met, the five remaining performances boast very good, if not spectacular, ticket sales. The performance was up to initial standards as well. James Levine was again in the pit and Colin Graham's production was still brilliantly imaginative. Teresa Stratas reprised her role as the ghostly Marie Antoinette, and Gino Quilico his as a Figaro who becomes mixed up with the French Revolution's Reign of Terror.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950405","headline":"Rival Claims to Island Chain Bring Edginess to Asia's Rim","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/world/rival-claims-to-island-chain-bring-edginess-to-asia-s-rim.html","abstract":"  China and its Southeast Asian neighbors say they are eager to avoid a military clash over a chain of potentially oil-rich islands in the South China Sea, but their recent actions suggest that they may be girding for a fight.

There are a few American Jewish organizations and lawmakers meddling in the Arab-Israel negotiations today who would do well to reflect on that lesson.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950405","headline":"At the Nation's Table: Austin, Tex.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/style/at-the-nations-table-austin-tex.html","abstract":"First, Bone and Chop\nThe Rattlesnake . . . \n Hudson's on the Bend, a hearty restaurant on the western edge of Austin, is closed on Sunday mornings, but on one Sunday each month, the parking lot is filled with pickups, four-wheel-drive vehicles and Mercedes-Benzes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950405","headline":"Rupite Journal; For a Revered Mystic, a Shrine Now of Her Own","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/world/rupite-journal-for-a-revered-mystic-a-shrine-now-of-her-own.html","abstract":"  This remote hamlet has become a shrine for the sick and troubled from throughout the Balkans and beyond.

Mr. Chailly has, in effect, turned a luxury car into a hot rod.    No doubt many concertgoers find this metamorphosis all to the good. Times and tastes change, after all, and these days gleaming precision and sheer sonic force are high on the list of orchestral virtues. Besides, whether one regards the Concertgebouw's flashy new sound as thrilling or coarse, it cannot be denied that section for section it remains one of the world's most polished ensembles.
