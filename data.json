At this historical juncture, it may be useful to pause to consider what, if anything, we have learned about power transfers and early independence from those African states that preceded South Africa in attaining freedom.   To be sure, South Africa is more urban, better educated -- even its black population -- and more industrial than were its neighbors to the north when they achieved independence. It also has a large and talented multiracial middle class.

Thus to rampaging gangs of ethnic butchers who have claimed as many as 250,000 lives, a diploma is a death certificate.

Since it does not permit a board or pieces, it can be played anywhere, on horseback, for example, as long as the players can report their moves to each other. Quick play probably began not long after the chess clock was introduced in 1883. Joop van Oosterom, a Dutch entrepreneur, brought the two together in his Melody Amber Tournament in Monaco from March 26 to April 7.   The adventurous sponsor assembled almost all the world's top players in this event in which each contested one game against the other 11 at the quick tempo of 25 minutes for each player for all moves. Each also contested a second game against the others at the same tempo but this time neither player was allowed chess pieces. They briefly communicated their moves by mouse on the empty screen of a computer chessboard. The clock invented by Bobby Fischer was used to time both types of game. For the quick game, it gave the players 10 additional seconds each time they moved. For the blindfold-quick game, it gave the players 20 extra seconds each time they moved.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940503","headline":"Understanding Terrorism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/03/opinion/understanding-terrorism.html","abstract":"Again, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat are to shake hands in a momentous ceremony, tomorrow in Cairo.

Unfortunately, emotions in Israel make the viability of peace with the Palestinians depend on cessation of all terror attacks -- an unrealistic objective. This dream gives the terrorists far too many chips and too much disruptive power.

The ban would not apply to guns now legally owned, although it would require the filing of a Federal form for such guns to be transferred.   The Senate's assault weapons ban was passed as part of the crime bill. It was chopped off the House version.

Back then, he seemed to be teaching the sonatas, presenting them as gems of crystalized musical imagination, set in velvet and examined in a bright, analytical light. Those accounts were by no means passionless, but their principal appeal was intellectual. Now the excitement Mr. Brendel finds in these works is more visceral, more concerned with the gritty, real-life side of Beethoven's music. The velvet has not entirely been cast aside, but the emphasis has shifted from admiring the music to experiencing it.    The works at hand in this installment of Mr. Brendel's three-year Beethoven cycle were the composer's first three sonatas (Op. 2) and his 23d, the \"Appassionata\" (Op. 57). The juxtaposition of the early works, completed in 1795, and the mature \"Appassionata,\" composed a decade later, tells an interesting story of shattered conventions and conceptual expansion. What Mr. Brendel showed, however, was that the seeds of explosive emotionalism that drive the \"Appassionata\" are to be found in the Opus 2 Sonatas, disguised by a veneer of Haydnesque decorousness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940504","headline":"Casino Cheating 101; Police and Other Officials Learn to Spot Those Who Break the Rules of the Game","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/04/nyregion/casino-cheating-101-police-other-officials-learn-spot-those-who-break-rules-game.html","abstract":"  Some people mash the blackjack cards with their rings.

The tragedy of Gorazde may for now at least be over. But there are other towns of equal strategic interest on which the Serbs are now free to concentrate their forces.

Then he sat down, seemed to leave his nervousness behind, and proceeded with the help of his band to perform three rocking pieces that perfectly blended improvisation and arrangement with jazz and Afro-Cuban musical sources.   Mr. Perez is a smart and gifted pianist, and he has placed himself right at the nexus of several cultural streams. With his band, which includes David Sanchez on saxophones, Larry Grenadier on bass, Ignacio Berroa on drums and Kimati Dinizulu on percussion, he moves easily between the music of the Caribbean and the United States. In Mr. Perez's hands, rhythms constantly shift. And he sends cultural references flying. One minute a boogie-woogie figure spreads shadows over an Afro-Cuban riff, another Mr. Perez muffles the strings inside the piano with his left hand while playing a riff surrounded by a dense and static percussion barrage, only to slide the music gracefully into a deeply swinging section.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940505","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/sports/results-plus-994863.html","abstract":"  HORSE RACING Sky Beauty Returns to Winner's Circle  Sky Beauty made a successful return to racing yesterday, scoring a three-length victory over For All Seasons in the $81,425 Grade II Vagrancy Stakes for fillies and mares at Belmont Park.

So, for almost a century, the fate of this small, no longer bucolic county has been hitched to the city's thirst for clean water.   But the county's strong-willed residents have never quite thought of themselves as just a watershed, some appendage to a big city, and many say they have become tired of being pushed around by the Goliath to the south.  Even Harsher Rules    Residents complain that the city, to protect its water and avoid spending $8 billion on treatment plants, has stepped up enforcement of long-ignored regulations for sewage treatment and storm-water drainage, forbidding the construction of household septic tanks and asphalt parking lots. In the next few weeks, the city plans to publish even harsher rules that county residents say will make it impossible or prohibitively expensive to build new businesses and homes and will derail the resurgent economy of a county that is two-thirds watershed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940505","headline":"U.S. Asks Russia for Data on Its Stocks of Nuclear Material","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/world/us-asks-russia-for-data-on-its-stocks-of-nuclear-material.html","abstract":"  In an effort to stem the spread of nuclear weapons, the Clinton Administration has asked Moscow to disclose how much plutonium and highly enriched uranium it has and where it can be found.
