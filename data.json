Grumet, declaring unconstitutional the public school district that New York State established for a community of Satmar Hasidim. Justice David H. Souter's majority opinion was joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred separately. Justice Antonin Scalia dissented in an opinion that was also signed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas. FROM THE DECISION  By Justice Souter    The Village of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, N.Y., is a religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim, practitioners of a strict form of Judaism. The village fell within the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until a special state statute passed in 1989 carved out a separate district following village lines to serve this distinctive population. The question is whether the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is binding on the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Because this unusual act is tantamount to an allocation of political power on a religious criterion and neither presupposes nor requires governmental impartiality toward religion, we hold that it violates the prohibition against establishment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940628","headline":"Germany Holds Off South Korea","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/28/sports/world-cup-94-germany-holds-off-south-korea.html","abstract":"  The first half of this Group C match today went according to form, with the defending World Cup champion German team all but squashing the quick but inexperienced South Korean team, which has never won a cup game.

Chief Justice William Rehnquist's opinion for a narrow 5-to-4 majority was a triumph of ideology over community needs to protect fragile environments and scarce resources.    For generations the right to use property as the owner saw fit, especially commercial property, has been subject to a social compact that includes valid zoning and land planning. But now the Court, driven by an ideology that exalts property ownership to undeserved heights, diminishes the ability of local governments to control development.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940628","time":"1994-06-28

Opponents would prefer to keep chemical arms to deter the use of gas by others. And a recent revelation that Russia may be concealing efforts to develop advanced chemical weapons has fueled doubts about Washington's ability to verify compliance.    The U.S. has not relied on chemical weapons as a deterrent in recent years and it would be imprudent to do so now, given its superiority in conventional arms. Moreover, the U.S. would be a lot more secure with the treaty's verification provisions than without them. They provide ways to detect and stop suspicious activities by any state.

By a 6-to-3 vote the Court struck down as unconstitutional the creation of a special school district for Satmar Hasidic residents of a town 50 miles northwest of New York City.    The decision was not surprising; the state's aid to the religious sect clearly crossed the church-state lines the Court has drawn for generations. The sect sends most of its children to private religious schools. But it had made a poignant plea that its handicapped children be granted special education, supported by public funds, in a separate district safe from the ridicule and hostility that might be generated in other public schools because of the sect's distinctive dress and reclusive living style.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940629","headline":"Personal Health","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/29/us/personal-health-530093.html","abstract":"  POOLS are great fun, terrific for cooling down on a hot day and for getting aerobic exercise.

Newly minted Russian businessmen are subsidizing the competition, which was once the hallmark of Communist high culture. In 1990, when the dying Soviet state was too strapped to pay, the Japanese electronics firm Pioneer came to the rescue. Four years later, the Russian bank Neftechimbank and Transaero, Russia's first private airline, have joined Pioneer to become sponsors of the 1994 competition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940629","headline":"Drug Use: Still a Hushed-Up Secret in Baseball","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/29/sports/baseball-drug-use-still-a-hushed-up-secret-in-baseball.html","abstract":"  Drug use.

That shift should make future governments more responsive to ordinary consumers and less beholden to bureaucracy and special interests.

As music director, Mr. Masur has thrown open the orchestra's doors for public discussions, open rehearsals and radio broadcasts. Ms. Borda, the executive director, has tried to lure untapped audiences by scheduling cheaper, shorter concerts at unusual times and festivals to highlight specific themes in music. Together, they have mended ties with a fractious, once-demoralized orchestra, winning critical acclaim for restoring its musical excellence.   Despite this string of successes, however, the Philharmonic has yet to shake the fiscal demons that have been haunting it, and other orchestras, in recent years. A deficit that first surfaced in 1990 will not disappear this year, as predicted.

After a brief flirtation with power in 1948, it settled into place as the permanent opposition party and seemed to take pride in the fact that it stood by its principles -- ardent pacifism, workers' rights, anti-Americanism -- rather than fighting for power.   As years passed, the Socialists exerted almost no influence over the conservative, increasingly corrupt power structure, and it has suffered its own corruption scandals. But the party remained the second-largest in Parliament, and its position struck a resonant chord with many Japanese. Most people regarded the Socialists as unsuited to govern but a useful check against the Liberal Democrats.  A Setback for Anti-Americanism    Never was this moral stance more in evidence than in 1960, when rioting broke out among Japanese who opposed extending the postwar security treaty with the United States.
