The same is true of Swiss Team matches, which are played in abundance at every weekend tournament. A fictional version, using actual deals, has appeared monthly for many years in The Bridge World, and its author, Jeff Rubens, has now collected some of them in \"Swiss Team Challenge\" ($13.75 including mailing from The Bridge World, 39 West 94th Street, New York, N.Y. 10025).   The diagramed deal, in which the author himself was the declarer, is one of the most difficult in the book. West leads the heart king and shifts to a trump. East takes his winners and lead his last trump, preventing any ruffs in the dummy. West throws his two heart losers, and reluctantly gives up the club eight when South plays another trump. South must then plan his play in this position:    [ DIAGRAM ]   South's primary chance is a normal diamond split, since he can set up the fifth diamond with a ruff and return to the club ace. But he should consider the possibility that somebody, probably West, has five diamonds. If that is true he could be squeezed in the red suits by cashing the ace and king of clubs followed by trumps. But removing the ace of clubs is fatal if East began with four diamonds.   South should give himself an extra chance by cashing the club king, seeking a little more information, and then leading a trump. That ruins West, for if he throws a club South can cash the ten. This is a clash squeeze, a very rare bird indeed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19921214","headline":"Health-Care Planners Urge A Tax on Workers' Benefits","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/14/us/health-care-planners-urge-a-tax-on-workers-benefits.html","abstract":"  A plan for health care reform that is gathering momentum around the country has at its heart a little-known but politically explosive proposal: taxing the health benefits employers give their workers.

Their heads are cast down. Luis Resto's score gives them a vast, dark landscape through which to move, though minimally. The fact that they danced before a closed curtain, slightly to the side of center, gives their duet a look of impermanence. It is as if the two men feel each other breathing.

Under some proposals, workers would pay taxes on part of the money employers spend on health care benefits -- anything over what it costs to buy the least expensive plan. Or employers may lose tax deductions on what they pay. Supporters say the idea makes economic sense, since it would force consumers to choose more carefully.

Miss O'Connell, who comes from a working-class family in County Clare, brings a clear-eyed realism to everything she sings. But if her Irish folk roots are evident, there is nothing provincial about her style.

His best-known buildings include the Ford Foundation Building in New York, the Oakland Museum and the General Foods Corporation headquarters in Rye Brook, N.Y.   Mr. Roche, who is 70 years old and was born in Ireland, first came to prominence as a partner of Eero Saarinen, whose firm he joined in 1950. After Saarinen's death in 1961, Mr. Roche took over the design of several major Saarinen projects, including the CBS Building in New York and the TWA Terminal at Kennedy International Airport. In 1966 Saarinen's firm was renamed Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates. That same year saw the completion of the Ford Foundation headquarters, a building that secured Mr. Roche's reputation as a leading American modernist. A Change in Approach    Since then, Mr. Roche's Connecticut-based firm has designed a number of major projects in New York, including the United Nations Plaza Hotel, the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum, for which he also devised the master plan, the Central Park Zoo, the Morgan Stanley Building and a new addition to the Jewish Museum. In his more recent projects Mr. Roche has departed from an early adherence to modernism's crisp geometric lines, and the exteriors of his buildings reflected a richer, more eclectic approach.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921214","headline":"After a Review, It's Bien Bien","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/14/sports/after-a-review-its-bien-bien.html","abstract":"Fraise's late-season bid for an Eclipse Award was won on the track but lost in the stewards' stand today when the Breeders' Cup Turf winner was disqualified for bumping a rival in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup at Hollywood Park.\n\nFraise and Bien Bien raced as one in the final furlong and were inseparable with 50 yards to go.

But the fierce storm, which caused six deaths in the New York region and disrupted travel, business and countless lives, was 500 miles out to sea. As Federal and state disaster officials began damage surveys and thousands of residents returned to flooded homes and began cleaning up the mess, there were no official estimates of the storm's cost. But unofficial estimates, some local damage assessments and comparisons with previous storms suggested that private and public losses were likely to run into hundreds of millions. A1. 3,000 HOMELESS ON LONG ISLAND   Almost 3,000 residents of Bayville, on Long Island's North Shore, remain homeless, their houses still under water left by Friday's storm. And throughout the island, more than 19,000 residents remained without electrical power. B5. NEW YORK CITY  RABBI ATTACKED IN MANHATTAN   In an assault that the police are investigating as a bias crime, a 62-year-old rabbi was attacked and stabbed by a man while walking near the one-room synagogue on the Lower East Side he had helped to keep alive. The rabbi, Shaya Apter, was listed in stable but guarded condition at Beth Israel Medical Center with two stab wounds of the stomach. B3. LITERARY SUBTEXT TO CONTRACT ISSUE   When a subcommittee of the New York City Board of Education begins considering whether to renew the contract of Chancellor Fernandez, the debate will take place in the shadow of a book. Mr. Fernandez and the panel have fought this year over a string of issues, but their relationship was strained further this month by the publication of dismissive remarks about the board, Mayor Dinkins and Governor Cuomo in Mr. Fernandez's autobiography. B3. A MAYOR'S RESPONSES, AND THEIR IMPACT   In responding to two events a month apart, Mayor Dinkins has come under fire, first for failing to convey sufficient outrage when a Brooklyn jury on Oct. 29 acquitted the accused killer of a rabbinical student and then for hastily overreaching by branding the assault on a black man on Dec. 1, apparently by Hasidic Jews, as a \"repugnant\" bias crime. Arguably, mayors might benefit from a self-imposed moratorium on their instant responses to daily peppering by reporters in the nation's most competitive media market. Metro Matters, B3. Prosecutors to recommend against prison for woman charged in daughter's shooting. B3. REGION  MATCHING UP THE MENTALLY ILL   When Robin Kravitz describes her struggle to pierce the solitude of mental illness, she is a study in turmoil. The blind dates, synagogue dances and a doomed romance make her fingers shake. Each attempt to bridge the gulf between her and \"the normal world,\" as she puts it, seemed a contract for defeat. And then along came Alice Cohen, matchmaker for the mentally ill. In a program that is raising doubts among doctors as well as gratitude among its users, Mrs. Cohen's dating service for the mentally ill, the Friendship Exchange, matches up people with schizophrenia or severe mood disorders. One of the first programs of its kind in the nation, it charges no fees and Mrs. Cohen, whose son is mentally ill, collects no salary. A1. THE EMPIRE RATE QUANDARY, AGAIN   In a few weeks, the New York State Insurance Department will rule on an issue that state lawmakers thought had been resolved by their landmark insurance law last summer: whether to impose an enormous rate increase on 1.4 million customers of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The request has placed Governor Cuomo in a bind: Either he allows the rate increase, leaving many customers priced out of insurance, or they deny the request, possibly forcing Empire into a crisis beyond repair.

Both these qualities are obvious in the new Alaias. Fitting as snugly as plaster to the ribs and waist, the jackets and coats flare out over the hips in princess lines. They evoke late-1930's and 40's silhouettes. Yet, they are as curvy as all get out, calling attention to the bosom and hips. They are a fascinating amalgam of ladylike dressmaking and unmistakable allure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Archives"},{"date":"19921215","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/news/pop-and-jazz-in-review-925692.html","abstract":"  Throwing Muses    The Knitting Factory SoHo      Throwing Muses, one of the most innovative collegiate-rock bands, has fissioned and shrunk.

The economy has surged since October, in large part because Americans seem to be feeling more confident about their jobs and their incomes. So they have gone shopping. But sometimes a major event, like a military victory or a Presidential election, can cause people to feel better off than they actually are. And after a while, the optimism disappears, along with the surge in shopping and economic growth.   That possibility makes the consumer confidence surveys that will be conducted over the next six weeks very important in gauging whether a strong recovery has finally arrived after nearly four years of weak growth or outright recession.

This is Not a Recipe.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/opinion/warning-this-is-not-a-recipe.html","abstract":"  What you see below appears to be a recipe.    But it is not a recipe.    It is a tool for making a political statement.   The arena? The holiday party.   You have cooked up something special, let's say your famous, lighter-than-air Solstice cookies. It's the pride of your kitchen, a secret recipe you've honed to perfection. You bring a batch to a party and your fellow-revelers are in hog heaven. Everything is merry until you find yourself cornered by someone preaching Recipe Socialism: share your secret or be branded Capitalist Running Dog.   Now, you mustn't admit that you don't want to give away your recipe because it's    yours    and you're entitled to it. That smacks of respect for private property and the subversive conceit that you deserve what you earn by the sweat of your brow. But if you try to be honest, your fellow traveler friend (eager to lay hands on undeserved gain) is apt to accuse you of lacking the holiday spirit.   Don't argue. Just clip out the following recipe (note how convincingly we've matched the layout of recipes in The Living Section), and present it to the pastry panhandler. Holiday Puffs   Total time: 25 minutes  1 egg  1/2 cup buttermilk (or 1/4 cup milk mixed with 1/4 cup vinegar)  5 teaspoons baking soda  1/2 teaspoon vanilla  1 cup lemon juice (fresh is best)  1/2 cup sugar  3/8 cup all-purpose flour   1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter a cookie sheet.   2. In a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup, beat the egg until foamy.   3. Add the buttermilk and the vanilla and blend well.   4. Add the baking soda, one teaspoon at a time, sprinkling it in and beating until the mixture is smooth and the consistency of light cream.   5. Add the lemon juice all at once. Stir gently until blended, but do not beat (it is important not to allow air to get trapped in the mixture).   6. Sift the sugar and the flour together in a small bowl and add it to the egg mixture a teaspoon at a time. Stir until just moistened.   7. Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls, one inch apart, onto the buttered cookie sheet.   8. Bake for 12 minutes or until golden. Serve hot.     Yield: 12 servings     Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 62 calories, 1 gram fat, 10 milligrams cholesterol, 2 milligrams sodium, 4 grams protein, 4 grams carbohydrate.    Then rest secure in the knowledge that when your pantry pinko reaches Step 5, about a gallon of lemon-egg foam will gush out of the measuring cup and inundate the kitchen counter. It's harmless, just lemon juice liberating the carbonate radical of the sodium bicarbonate to produce a cascade of CO2 bubbles -- no fires and, regrettably, no explosions. But plenty messy and more than enough to make Chef Share-the-Wealth crazy.   A ruling-class lackey like yourself may want to photocopy and distribute this recipe to all the bleeding hearts at the party. Or add a touch of verisimilitude by writing it out on a file card, dipping it in weak tea to age the paper and leaving it out as freeloader flypaper. And if nobody's trying to mooch a recipe from you, no need to feel left out. Be an anarchist: slip the recipe into someone else's fax machine (it's a virus) and use the auto dialer to send little bundles of holiday chaos all 'round the world.

He is the musical charmer who seduces Death into taking a holiday, if only a short one.

Myths like this live partly because they are malleable. So when Craig Lucas (words) and Gerald Busby (music) deposit the Orpheus myth in the midst of music students at an American community college, minor adjustments make it fit. Tinkering with the ending of this story is an old operatic tradition anyway. The one for \"Orpheus in Love,\" which opened last night at the Circle Repertory Company, falls between happy and unhappy.

The labor market is weaker than the unemployment rate suggests, for several reasons. Many workers are involuntarily working short time when they would like to be working full time. As everybody knows, we're experiencing an unusual series of layoffs by businesses, permanent layoffs, not temporary cyclical layoffs.    Why can't the Federal Reserve do this job by itself? Well, we heard about the bank credit crunch yesterday and we see that the Fed has more or less given up on doing anything more to stimulate demand, even though it has 300 basis points left between interest rates, short-term interest rates now and zero. I think maybe the Fed did things so late and so little during the recent downturns that they let the economy and business expectations slip away from their grasp.    That's why I think the country needs some fiscal stimulus in the short run. I would be willing to see something like 1 percent of G.D.P. stimulus, which would be about $60 billion a year, and for a couple of years. Other people may prefer a smaller amount.    Now fiscal policy for recovery is bound to raise the deficit temporarily. And we're fooling ourselves if we think there's a way of having a fiscal stimulus that doesn't have that result.    The thing to do, I believe, is to combine the short-run fiscal stimulus with credible deficit reduction policies that will be phased in at a later time, so far as possible enacted, so that they will come into effect at a later time, whether they're tax increases or expenditure reductions.    In today's weak economy, fiscal austerity would be counterproductive and would actually reduce investment in plant and equipment, in technology and human capital for the future. So it actually would damage the prospects of our children and grandchildren, rather than improving them.  Allen Sinai  Chief economist, Boston Company    Short run, a modest dose of net fiscal stimulus probably is necessary to lift growth and jobs as part of the task of raising potential growth in the long run, as well as to sustain a fledgling business expansion. A $20 billion to $30 billion program of short-run fiscal stimulus I believe should be ready to go, legislated as needed in early 1993.    The measures used in this fiscal stimulus I think should . . . do double duty in the sense of being measures that lift short-run growth in jobs but also raise long-run potential output. Candidates . . . include infrastructure spending on roads, highways, buildings, airports, rail and telecommunications and equipment investment tax credits.   Investment tax credits would produce the greatest bang for a buck if they were targeted towards productive equipment, incremental and refundable. Other possibilities: measures such as inflation indexing of capital gains, R.& D. tax credits, education and manpower training programs and incentives for small business.    A major effort should be made to find measures that can raise growth without raising the Federal budget deficit. Some possibilities include an easier bank regulatory environment for bank lending to improve growth at little cost to the budget, a shift in the composition of Treasury financing further away from long-term issues to reduce interest costs of Federal Government financing and greater efficiencies and reduced costs for the provision and delivery of health care services.   On timing, you should do it right away and  [ make it ]  retroactive . . . to early December. I think the impact would be in the second through the fourth quarter of next year when the current impulse of the economy may indeed be fading and so it would come at the right time. If you wait longer, it's dangerous.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Mr. Gaidar Departs, Democratically","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/opinion/mr-gaidar-departs-democratically.html","abstract":"  It's tempting to interpret the resignation of Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar of Russia as a startling rebuke to Boris Yeltsin and his program of radical economic reform. Yet even with the more- cautious apparatchik Viktor Chernomyrdin in the job, reform could still go forward, though at a slower pace and on a different trajectory. And though the infighting was brutal, the result was reached democratically.   That reaffirms the wisdom of not imposing a made-in-America brand of economic policy as the test for all United States aid to Russia. America's basic interest lies in consolidating democracy's tenuous hold on this vast and troubled country and preventing a fateful turn to ultra-nationalist demagoguery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Expectation and Intricacy Conspire Against Nagle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/sports/pro-football-expectation-and-intricacy-conspire-against-nagle.html","abstract":"  He has been at it for 11 months -- morning, afternoon and often nights -- and Browning Nagle still can't complete even half his passes and has thrown 14 interceptions to only 6 touchdowns.

They were sculptured with the assurance of a master. Nothing was ornate or excessive. Mr. Prey didn't need to \"emote\" or impose feeling on a phrase. He seemed to take on the persona of each song, becoming the young lover, the worshipful son, the wizened wanderer. In \"Alinde\" he presented an eerie Romantic drama of dialogue and yearning. In \"Der Schiffer\" -- \"The Boatman\" -- his voice seemed to embody animal energy, the recurring accents suggesting the repeated swell of waves. \"Die Allmacht\" -- a paean to the power of Jehovah -- had the authority and wonder of authentic faith.

A Caribbean Christmas Party\" (Rykodisc USA) to the mellow sounds of \"Mel Torme's Christmas Songs\" (Telarc). Because holiday albums have a successful record, record companies each year deck the stores with a hodgepodge of sparkling new ones and a cornucopia of old ones.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Dycom Industries reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/business/dycom-industries-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html","abstract":"*3*** COMPANY REPORTS **","thumbnail":null,"section":"Business Day"},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Review/Film; A Family That's Not So Nice to Come Home to","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/movies/review-film-a-family-that-s-not-so-nice-to-come-home-to.html","abstract":"Queens widow with problem relatives and secret admirer.

But fleeting thoughts and occasional action hardly count. Despite the increasing costs of cards and postage, holiday greetings still flood post offices every year. Untold hours are spent choosing, signing and addressing them, and a lot of midnight oil is burned by men and women creating original and highly personalized greetings.   A completely unscientific survey seems to indicate that an increasing number of people each year make the momentous decision to stop sending cards, but the number is still minimal. Nevertheless, the men and women who have decided to flout tradition take some pride in their decision and almost never back down -- there's the odd twinge of guilt, but that seems to be about it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Home & Garden"},{"date":"19921216","headline":"Sales of U.S.-Made Vehicles Maintain Their Strong Pace","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/16/business/sales-of-us-made-vehicles-maintain-their-strong-pace.html","abstract":"  In keeping with generally stronger retail activity, momentum in the automotive market carried over from last month as sales of domestically produced light vehicles surged 17.9 percent higher in early December compared with the corresponding period a year ago.
