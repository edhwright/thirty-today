Actually, it is difficult not to think about lunch when one is closeted with people who arrive for their civic duty armed with a list of dim sum parlors. My list, however, had no dim sum parlors (I was open to suggestion), but it did have a Thai restaurant remembered for its squid, and an Italian restaurant remembered for its linguine with clam sauce. They, along with most of the restaurants around City Hall, have another distinction as well.

This is not a \"high art versus low art\" polemic. Both kinds of music exist within the classical music world, just as they do in rock and jazz.    Now and then these approaches intersect, as when, for example, Luciano Pavarotti is at his best, when he is in good voice and when his heart is in the music. When he is not -- as was the case on Sunday afternoon, when he sang a recital at the Metropolitan Opera House -- his performances are a measure of the gulf between showmanship and artistry, and an enlightening look at the artistic placebo effect.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"1944:Spain Denounced : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/opinion/IHT-1944spain-denounced-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WASHINGTON - [From our New York edition:] The United States today [Feb. 21] officially identified the Falangist movement of Generalissimo Francisco Franco as the Spanish counterpart of Nazism and Fascism and charged it with seeking restoration of the old","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"Hunyady Wins for Austria, and Hungary, Too","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/sports/winter-olympics-hunyady-wins-for-austria-and-hungary-too.html","abstract":"  Emese Hunyady, an Austrian from an old Hungarian family, won the gold medal in the women's 1,500-meter speed skating race today while Bonnie Blair of the United States just missed in a gallant attempt to win a sixth career medal in the Winter Games.

A two-year delay will give Congress a chance to determine whether the gross mismanagement prompting that pullout has been convincingly corrected.   Mr. Reagan's move won widespread applause. Washington provided one-fourth of the budget for Unesco's profligate Paris-based bureaucracy, notorious as a patronage dumping ground. Unesco had also become synonymous with vaporous declarations that were hostile to Western institutions, especially the press. Delegates from Soviet bloc and third-world tyrannies pushed for a \"New World Information Order\" in which journalists would become little more than cheerleaders for established regimes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940223","headline":"Scalia: Fifth Amendment 'Clearly Permits the Death Penalty'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/us/scalia-fifth-amendment-clearly-permits-the-death-penalty.html","abstract":"  Following are excerpts from Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion concurring in the Supreme Court's order denying review in a Texas death penalty case, Callins v. Collins, No. 93-7054. In it, Justice Scalia responds to Justice Harry A. Blackmun's condemnation of the death penalty.   Justice Blackmun dissents from the denial of certiorari in this case with a statement explaining why the death penalty \"as currently administered,\" is contrary to the Constitution of the United States. That explanation often refers to \"intellectual, moral and personal\" perceptions, but never to the text and tradition of the Constitution. It is the latter rather than the former that ought to control. The Fifth Amendment provides that \"(n)o person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, . . . nor be deprived of life . . . without due process of law.\" This clearly permits the death penalty to be imposed, and establishes beyond doubt that the death penalty is not one of the \"cruel and unusual punishments\" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940223","headline":"Radinsky Will Probably Miss Season","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/sports/sports-people-baseball-radinsky-will-probably-miss-season.html","abstract":"  SCOTT RADINSKY, A Chicago White Sox reliever, had a malignant lymph node removed from his neck, and will likely miss the season while undergoing treatment to prevent the spread of Hodgkin's disease.

The spectacle ended last week with Ms. Sawyer staying put at ABC, with a new salary estimated at up to $7 million and new assignments that will make her, as Bill Carter wrote in The New York Times, \"the most visible news figure in television's most watched hours.\"   The biggest coup in television news this month, aired on PBS's \"Frontline\" just as Ms. Sawyer closed her deal, was a documentary titled \"Tabloid Truth.\" Tracing the TV-news feeding frenzy on a single story -- the Michael Jackson scandal -- the correspondent, Richard Ben Cramer, revealed that the seamy journalistic standards and sometimes the personnel of tabloid shows like \"Hard Copy\" and \"A Current Affair\" are inexorably tainting network news departments.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Big East Conference Approaching a Crossroad","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/sports/on-college-basketball-big-east-conference-approaching-a-crossroad.html","abstract":"  Now that a countdown is leading toward the inevitable demise of the Big East Conference as we have known it, to be determined as soon as tomorrow, the most remarkable achievement of this collection of colleges should be remembered as something beyond its meteoric growth, its special collection of gifted athletes, its honeymoon with cable television and its boldly successful risk taking.   For a decade and a half, since four Eastern athletic directors first gathered at a La Guardia Airport hotel in search of a better way, a league has somehow reached unparalleled success in an enclave free from the influences of the football establishment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Israel Must Decide Price of Peace for Itself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/opinion/l-israel-must-decide-price-of-peace-for-itself-285196.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Israelis living in the valley below the Golan Heights may still remember the shells that were fired from Syrian guns in 1967. The condition was unacceptable. At the cost of the lives of several hundred Israeli soldiers, and many more who were maimed for life, the guns were silenced. These young men gave their lives for one reason only, that there be peace and quiet in the valley.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Sitting at War's HQ, Bosnian Serbs Talk of Peace","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/world/sitting-at-war-s-hq-bosnian-serbs-talk-of-peace.html","abstract":"  Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, put it bluntly this week: \"We would rather drive Mercedeses than tanks.\"    After almost two years of war in Bosnia, it appears that the Serbs -- both in Belgrade and in Bosnia -- are actively pursuing a peace settlement in the conviction that Russia's new involvement can secure them a share of Bosnia that they could accept.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Legal Fight on Ousted School Head Is Likely to Clarify Chancellor's Powers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/nyregion/legal-fight-on-ousted-school-head-is-likely-to-clarify-chancellor-s-powers.html","abstract":"  A dispute between Schools Chancellor Ramon C.

Mr. Cortines has credited Mr. Johnson with leading an educational renaissance in the district, which includes the west central Bronx.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Sugar Is to Blame for Little Monsters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/opinion/l-sugar-is-to-blame-for-little-monsters-285161.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The sugar industry must be pleased that a new study is being pointed to as proof that sugar does not cause hyperactivity in children. The study, conducted by Dr. Mark L. Wolraich of Vanderbilt University and involving 48 normal preschool and school-age children, shows only that a small number of children whose parents believed they were sugar-sensitive did not react to table sugar. (Corn sugar, a widely used sweetener, was not tested.)   Several previous studies, as well as numerous reports from pediatricians and allergists, found that sugar indeed causes some children to become more active or to engage in inappropriate behavior. The effects of sugar could well be exacerbated by the effects of dyes or other food ingredients commonly found in sugary foods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"Critic's Notebook; In Russia, Artists Talk of Money and Money Talks","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/arts/critic-s-notebook-in-russia-artists-talk-of-money-and-money-talks.html","abstract":"  In the depths of the Russian winter, the cold drives the tattier St. Petersburg street vendors indoors. Snow masks the urban decay and reflects light off the city's pastel palaces and golden monuments glittering in the sun. The canals and even the Neva River are mostly frozen, steam rising eerily from the water and ducks scrabbling desperately for food. It's so cold, about all one can do is talk.   At the State Hermitage Museum, as at all large Russian arts institutions, the talk is mostly of money. Since Mikhail B. Piotrovsky inherited the job of director from his father in the summer of 1992 -- Vitaly A. Suslov briefly bridged the gap between the two men -- he seems to have done an admirable job establishing links to the West and otherwise compensating for faltering state support.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940224","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Carlos Teles, the concierge at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris, is reading the French translation of \"Of Mice and Men\" by John Steinbeck..\"Why am I reading it?
