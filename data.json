But it seemed as if the entire cast, supported by James Levine's supple conducting, was attentive to his esthetic lessons. There were beautifully structured arias but also exquisite nuances; freedom accompanied law. One was tempted to paraphrase Sachs's acclaim for Walther: this came close to being a Masterscene.   There were many highlights throughout the performance, but that scene -- with its final quintet -- was the heart of this impressive, uncut \"Meistersinger.\" Otto Schenk has again made a case for traditionally staged Wagner at the Met, following the composer's detailed directions. In this case, the literalness made still more sense because Wagner violated his own principles for musical drama and used a realistic subject, not a mythical one, basing his story on the song contests once held by German guilds.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930116","headline":"Observer; Must Be Democrats","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/16/opinion/observer-must-be-democrats.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration looks ready to hit the ground stumbling.

Instead, it is nature's version of the all-purpose player, a quality clearly expressed in the striper's appearance. Although the fish has a slightly pugnacious mug, relatively large scales, and sharp tines on its dorsal fin, it is a marvel of fine proportions. \n\nThe striper's head is bold but handsome. Its iridescent silver flanks are dramatically marked with dark, horizontal stripes, and the rear half of the dorsal fin is an elegant, curved fan. But good looks alone have not allowed the striper to survive the harsh oceanic environment where life pretty much boils down to trying to eat something smaller than you before you are eaten by something bigger than you. Forged in this briny predator's carnival, the striper is a vivid illustration of the balance that can be struck between beauty and purpose.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Kelly and Marino Race the Clock","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/sports/conference-championships-kelly-and-marino-race-the-clock.html","abstract":"  Any discussion of successful active quarterbacks in the National Football League invariably leads to the mention of Buffalo's Jim Kelly and Miami's Dan Marino.

The Michelin two-star chef (and a worthy candidate for a coveted third star) recently transferred his restaurant from an airy, loftlike space in the center of town to a classic Art Deco mansion, built by a local pharmacist in 1932 as a house designed for gastronomic celebration.   Like Mr. Gagnaire's cuisine -- grounded in the classics but offering bold touches of creativity, enthusiasm and humor -- the house fuses past, present and future artistic traditions. Dining in this white and ivory space with bold touches of color is like feasting in a bright, modern living museum. Every detail -- from doorknobs to light switches to artful menus -- has been considered, but there is no tortured sense of design for design's sake.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Streetscapes: 200 East 84th Street; A Middle-Aged Frump Gets A Belated Soupcon of Glamour","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/realestate/streetscapes-200-east-84th-street-middle-aged-frump-gets-belated-soupcon-glamour.html","abstract":"  THIS is a revolution not of bullets, but of blueprints.

In BERTHE MORISOT'S IMAGES OF WOMEN (Harvard University, $45), Anne Higonnet declares that \"Morisot became a painter despite being a woman,\" then argues that the painter's association with the Impressionist movement was an extraordinary feat. However, this thoroughly researched study shows that such was not the case. Morisot (1841-95) profited from her upper-middle-class origins -- for example, she studied painting under Corot with the support of her mother. Her marriage in 1874 to Eugene Manet, the brother of the painter Edouard, made her socially and professionally a member of Impressionist circles. Little wonder that Morisot showed her work in all but one of the Impressionist exhibitions. Ms. Higonnet, who teaches art history at Wellesley College, devotes very little space to Morisot's style or technique, instead focusing on the sociopolitical forces that shaped her paintings. Even though the 1894 painting \"Julie Dreaming\" boldly depicts a sensual, languid adolescent, Ms. Higonnet writes, overall Morisot's work \"reflected a middle-class ideology of domestic femininity.\" This observation seems fair, even though Ms. Higonnet then argues that Morisot wished to be freed \"from the cultural constraints of gender.\" The author's unstable definition of the painter's relationship to her sex, and of the place of the female artist in 19th-century France, is disappointing and ultimately irritating. It is a pity that ideology should be put to work toward a belated recognition of Berthe Morisot; her talent alone should suffice.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Southern Liberals in Love","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/books/southern-liberals-in-love.html","abstract":"FAVORITE SONS\n\nBy John Russell.\n318 pp. Chapel Hill, N.C.:\nAlgonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $19.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"POSTINGS: Housing and Commerce; Seeds of Change on 6th Ave.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/realestate/postings-housing-and-commerce-seeds-of-change-on-6th-ave.html","abstract":"  The announcement last week that the four largest flower wholesalers were pulling up roots from the traditional Flower District on the Avenue of the Americas was only part of an economic development story that promises dramatic change in the area.

The garden, scheduled to open last week, features tropical plants, especially bromeliads, set amid cascading streams in a greenhouse roughly 40 by 50 feet at the western end of the 3.5-acre conservatory complex. The project was a collaboration between Mr. Burle Marx and Conrad Hamerman, a landscape architect in Philadelphia.   Bromeliads, which include such plants as pineapples and Spanish moss, absorb moisture through hairlike scales covering their leaves. In the Cascade Garden, fog emitters spray mists to maintain 80 percent humidity; 3,000 feet of heating cable wound through the beds and in the walls and structural columns keep the plants' roots above 60 degrees. The designers were inspired by the runnels of water that trickle down tropical mountainsides, Mr. Hamerman said, but he noted the garden was \"an abstraction of nature, not an imitation.\" Steel columns and other structural elements of the greenhouse, which was built in 1958, played a big role in the garden's design, which has a strong vertical sweep. Some 35 tons of Pennsylvania mica from local quarries were used in the stonework.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"When Shakespeare Wasn't for Everyone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/theater/sunday-view-when-shakespeare-wasn-t-for-everyone.html","abstract":"  I don't suppose the acting profession requires much defending these days, but if ever I'm called upon to come up with an eloquent explanation of why actors act, I know whom I'll quote.

It's all they dream about, miracle drives and last-minute scores. As the seconds tick down, the hopes and expectations of cities around the country rise and fall with the fortunes of their sports heroes. If the home team loses on Sunday, studies show, then on Monday workers' productivity plummets and everyone gets depressed. If the team wins, business soars and taverns fill up. This link between a city's psyche and the fate of its football players may seem strange to those not swept up by National Football League delirium. Why, skeptics are apt to wonder, would a big city invest so much of itself in the vicissitudes of a major sports franchise?\n\nFor a city like Buffalo, the answer lies in its own past. Like Cleveland, Detroit and Pittsburgh, cities with similarly checkered economic stories, Buffalo looks to its big-league sports teams for the gratification denied it by history. Misfortunes, whether a plant closing, a toxic event or a botched Super Bowl, have a way of shaping a city. And while they rarely admit to it, Buffalonians are a little haunted by a past that reminds them how close and yet how far away their dreams are.

Since the makeshift Rainbow staging, with no discernable sign of direction by Mr. Toppo, has none of the above, the choice of play is simply unfathomable for a company that has dealt with somber contemporary plays.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Sports of The Times; Montana's Stand-In Scenario","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-montana-s-stand-in-scenario.html","abstract":"  AS compelling as Steve Young has been as the 49ers' quarterback, if he were an actor, he would be starring in a motion picture with Jack Nicholson learning his lines as a stand-in.

Nevertheless, some places stand out. One such that I especially love is La Chiusa, in the hamlet of Montefollonico (province of Siena), just outside Montepulciano, the famous Tuscan wine town. The owner, Umberto Lucherini, acts as host and sommelier, but the servers are women, unusual for Italy, as is the chef, Mr. Lucherino's wife and co-owner, Dania Masotti.   In a large converted farmhouse, La Chiusa is an elegant establishment, seating 40 to 50 people, with a tasteful rusticity in the form of brick, beams and a great wooden bottle-filled island in the middle of the spacious dining room. Local women move a little cart from table to table, making by hand the evening's pici, a spaghettilike Tuscan pasta, as well as other kinds of pasta.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"CRIME","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/books/crime-306193.html","abstract":"  James W. Hall knows a place, which he describes with affectionate horror in HARD AGROUND (Delacorte, $22), where lazy treasure seekers will fork over $500 for a dubious map to a sunken ship laden with 17th-century Mayan gold. In the avaricious climate of this place, a serious scavenger could just as easily save the 500 bucks and get more reliable information through theft and murder. The author calls this degraded place Miami, and he mourns its physical and moral wreckage with splenetic, comic rage.   Hap Tyler, the driven hero of Mr. Hall's fourth imaginative crime novel, sees himself as representing \"the insipid, watered-down, failure-prone\" genetic strain of an illustrious ancestor who was one of Florida's first land developers. When Hap's brother, an archeologist who has the inside track on that lost ship, is murdered by ruthless booty hunters, Hap bravely launches himself on a wild crusade to avenge his brother and to save their ancestral home from inventively wicked characters. Mr. Hall, whose earlier, moodier novels were set in the environmentally fragile Florida Keys, has lightened his imagistic style and found a lode of flashier inspiration on the glittery Gold Coast. Although poetic lyricism fades in this bright setting, it's the right place for the vivid characters and their bold adventures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Per-Bag Garbage System Creeps Along","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/perbag-garbage-system-creeps-along.html","abstract":"THE Robertsons on Chatham Street pay $4 a week to dispose of their household garbage, while on the other side of this Morris County community, the Stemmlers on Edge Hill Road pay $6. \n\nThat difference reflects the quantity of garbage the two families set out each week, the cost standard since Chatham Borough began assessing residents on a fee-per-container basis last fall.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"If It's a Saturday, It Must Be Election Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/if-it-s-a-saturday-it-must-be-election-day.html","abstract":"  PEOPLE who see advertisements proclaiming a special election in the 29th State Senate District on Jan. 23 may think they include a typographical error.

It's true that archeologists are excavating graves from the fort along present-day Alameda Street, and that the Pima County Courthouse is an amiable example of Spanish Colonial Revival kitsch. But in general, downtown Tucson has papered over its Hispanic origins, with a few exceptions. There are two downtown districts, both within walking distance of El Presidio Park, that bring Hispanic Tucson vividly to life. In one, directly north of the park and also called El Presidio, it's possible to walk Tucson's evolution from a Mexican to an American town in one block; the other is a compact neighborhood of more than 150 plastered adobe houses called the Barrio Historico.\n\nThe barrio occupies 13 blocks just south of the very contemporary Tucson Community Center; its main streets are Convent, Meyer and Main. In spite of gentrification, the neighborhood seems frozen somewhere in a purely Hispanic past.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Magnetic Therapy to Relieve Arthritis Pain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/magnetic-therapy-to-relieve-arthritis-pain.html","abstract":"WHEN Harold Goldman developed bleeding ulcers from the drugs he was taking for arthritis, his doctor warned him to stop taking the medication and have a knee replacement. \n\n\"Even with the arthritis, I was used to bowling and playing golf and tennis,\" Mr. Goldman, 73, of Merrick, said. \"I used to take the painkillers before and after I'd play.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Laura Whitman, Paul Provost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/style/engagements-laura-whitman-paul-provost.html","abstract":"  July wedding plans have been announced by Mr. and Mrs. William F.

The opulent 120-seat restaurant is reminiscent of a Mogul palace with marble floors, crystal chandeliers, ornate wall hangings and royal-blue and gold-leaf furniture. Waiters in stunning sherwani, (a brocaded jacket worn below the knee, a feature of Mogul attire) serve dishes brought to the table in sealed earthenware pots, for dum pukht is a Mogul pot-roasting technique. Meat cooked over low heat in sealed clay pots develops a unique tenderness and a deep, earthy flavor. What distinguishes dum pukht from other clay-pot cooking around the world is the addition of mogul spices, whose volatile oils imbue the food with extraordinary delicacy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Seton Hall Is Pitt's Latest Upset Victim","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/sports/college-basketball-seton-hall-is-pitt-s-latest-upset-victim.html","abstract":"  Pitt's basketball team may not be ranked in the top 25, but the Panthers certainly know how to beat teams that are.

The monthly maintenance charges were $350, but they have now risen to $598. In 1990 and 1991, a 13th-month assessment was made to defray rising costs. In 1992, two extra months of charges were again requested as special assessments. I have been paying the regular maintenance of $598 on time but have been unable to meet the last two assessments, totaling $1,169.00. I have recently been asked to pay these arrears and my suspicion is that yet another 13th assessment will be requested soon. The regular maintenance also goes up every January. Can you tell me whether these assessments are legal? Am I obligated to pay them? . . . M. Williams, Manhattan Answer: Yes. Common charges, according to Richard Siegler, a Manhattan lawyer, are generally imposed by the board of managers to defray the operations of the condominium, and they are borne by everybody in proportion to their interest in the condominium. He said the common charges could be changed as often as necessary to insure that the expenses were paid. They can be added to the regular monthly assessment or tacked on as a special assessment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/c-corrections-336393.html","abstract":"  A report in the Dining Out column on Dec. 27 misstated the credit-card policy of Vespa in Great Neck.

Technically he is endowed with a neat figure, natural turn-out, exceptional elevation, impeccable turns and beats, strong but sensitive feet (rare in a man) and a suppleness laced with a fiery dash of Slav temperament which permits him more grace than most men could get away with.

Franks,   The Dancing Times (London), March 1962    \"A pop dancer -- that's what we've got -- a pop dancer, at last.

Pop dancers, like pop singers, have got to have a gimmick or some special thing about them, like tears or a wiggle or a half-starved little-boy look; and I think Nureyev's thing is that even when he is behaving in a withdrawn and gentlemanly way you feel that he may suddenly snarl and bite you in the neck.\"  Richard Buckle,   The Sunday Times of London, May 20, 1962   \"Nureyev, with his shock of unruly hair, his sullen expression, seems indeed, at first glance, like a beatnik in ballet tights. . . .

The discipline of a premier danseur appears to cloak a creature of wild and beautiful movement impulses.\" Walter Terry,   The New York Herald Tribune, June 10, 1962   \"From the very beginning of the 'Flower Festival' pas de deux Mr. Nureyev showed why he has been an object of dance attention during the past year. It is because of his extraordinary personality projection, which is the result of a natural stage instinct developed with the most careful calculation, and because of the unusual quality of his dance movements. He has an acute consciousness of every part of his body from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers and toes; he knows that every little inflection of it counts and he sees to it that the audience is made aware of each inflection.\"  Allen Hughes,   The New York Times, Oct. 22, 1962  ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930117","headline":"Katie's Ordeal: Seeking Friendship, Finding 16 Days of Terror","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/nyregion/katie-s-ordeal-seeking-friendship-finding-16-days-of-terror.html","abstract":"  Katie Beers's voyage through the trapdoors of a man's twisted mind began as a lonely girl's dream outing: a birthday shopping expedition for the kinds of things her family never bought her, followed by a trip to the video arcade.

But after a month and a half of treatment at a clinic in Lexington, Ky., they found that the colt's system was once more producing red blood cells and he returned last week to his winter quarters at the Jonabell Farm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930118","headline":"Qiaotou Journal; Chinese Bet Their Shirts on Buttons and, Bingo!","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/18/world/qiaotou-journal-chinese-bet-their-shirts-on-buttons-and-bingo.html","abstract":"  For a glimpse into China's economic revolution, it is useful to stroll down the main street of this humble little town on the banks of a putrid river in the middle of nowhere.

Its Egyptian setting, after all, is a fanciful affectation: apart from the pyramids, which do double duty as Egyptian and Masonic symbols, the work's connections with Egypt are tenuous. The Masonic ritual toward which the tale so elegantly leads is, mythical Egyptophilia notwithstanding, entirely Northern European. And its characters seem almost Alpine. Papageno, for one, may have a connection with the bird-men of Egyptian hieroglyphics, but surely those fierce-looking figures are not meant to be Papageno-like dunces. Indeed, the work's blend of low comedy and high seriousness argues that the setting is the least of the work's concerns.   But for all the leeway this opera offers, directors who update it, transport it or otherwise depart from the traditional staging are few. The production that returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday evening is not among the renegades. Based on a John Cox staging that was originally mounted at Glyndebourne 15 years ago, this \"Zauberflote\" was restaged at the Met by Guus Mostart in 1991, and is now directed by David Kneuss.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930118","headline":"Despite Critics Right and Left, Mandela Pushes Talks With de Klerk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/18/world/despite-critics-right-and-left-mandela-pushes-talks-with-de-klerk.html","abstract":"  Nelson Mandela, the president of the African National Congress, said today that mounting alarm about South Africa's economy had created a new sense of urgency that he believes will bring the end of white rule this year.

Also known as overtone or harmonic singing, throat singing allows a performer to produce two or three notes at once through careful positioning of the lips, tongue, jaw, velum and larynx. The singer produces a basic note as well as its harmonics, which have a flute- or whistle-like tone.   Tuva, a former Soviet autonomous oblast bordered by Russia and Mongolia, is one of the few places where overtone singing is practiced. Other throat singers, such as the Gyoto Tantric Choir and new-age innovator David Hykes, place the technique in a spiritual context, emphasizing the discipline it requires and its meditative qualities. The singers from Tuva showed another way it can signify: as a means of storytelling and of comprehending the natural world through art, which are classic motivations for folk music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930118","headline":"Miami Gives Up Ball And a Trip to the Bowl","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/18/sports/conference-championships-miami-gives-up-ball-and-a-trip-to-the-bowl.html","abstract":"  Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino stood in a near-empty locker room at Joe Robbie Stadium today and spoke softly but matter-of-factly about another squandered chance to reach the Super Bowl.

Maria Excommunikata, a band with an international membership and a penchant for spooky melodrama, bore an uncanny resemblance to the outrageous glam groups that dash madly through Mr. Almodovar's movies. Arrayed in the black costumes of a thousand Halloweens, these women swooped through a repertory of original songs that mixed gothic imagery, hard-rock posturing and cabaret sentimentality into a brew that could have been deliciously clever had it been seasoned with a bit of irreverence.   But Maria Excommunikata's performance was unfortunately marked by more sincerity than wit. The group's musical abilities did not save it from its own pretensions. The operatic vocals of the Romanian-born Anca Marinescu intertwined with the atmospheric guitar work of Elizabeth Morgan and the snaky keyboards of Sina Hjort of Denmark to form intriguing sound patterns recalling early 80's gothic rock, but the songs' lyrics were stuck in typical boy-girl sentimentalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930118","headline":"Correction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/18/arts/c-correction-866593.html","abstract":"  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the actor Michael Aldridge was published in error.
