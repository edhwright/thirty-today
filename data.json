Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, intends to talk about jobs, when she puts forth her own economic-stimulus program next Tuesday. Legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle are eager to talk about jobs too.

In this companion volume to the collection's first venture out of its Merion, Pa., gallery, works by Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne and Picasso make their first print appearance in gorgeous color and endow each page with revelations of exquisite nuance, astonishing detail, innovative technique and sheer intelligence. French and American scholars have contributed extensive and accessible notes about the artists' careers, the paintings' origins and their place within the Barnes collection. Paradoxically, the forewords and introductory essays to this brilliant array reveal that its esthetic bias somewhat belies the vision Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951) -- chemist, businessman, philanthropist, educator and adventurous collector -- strove to establish and communicate through his collection as a whole. Barnes was obsessed by the continuity of great art throughout the ages, and he delighted in conveying what he had discovered -- that, for example, Modigliani's figures echoed the elongated lines of African tribal masks. Thus his gallery showed ancient Chinese paintings, ceramics and old European masters next to the then-risque French paintings reproduced in this book, and next to the American Indian and African-American art, African sculptures and Mexican retablos he was among the first to collect. This illuminating context is sorely missed. This aside, though, the greatness of the French paintings shown here cannot be denied.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"Chelsea Warning: No Red-Light District","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-chelsea-warning-no-red-light-district.html","abstract":"  When the police closed a fifth-floor massage parlor called the Honey Bee Oriental Club last week, it brought to 10 the number of unlicensed Chelsea massage parlors shut down this year for prostitution.   \"We've moved against massage parlors in midtown before, but what's new is the large concentration of illegal activity in Chelsea, a largely residential neighborhood,\" said William H.

The Smithsonian Institution, one of the world's largest museum complexes, and the National Gallery of Art are also free.

Styles of The Times asked three of the Lampoon's present staff members to comment on Mr. O'Brien's first week.: Dear Conan,   Though flattered by the opportunity to offer you some constructive criticism, we feel it's a bit like the snotty little reprobate back-talking a well-respected teacher. (You have long been admired at our little magazine.) Anyway, everyone knows we would be fools to make any negative comments about a man to whom we will all soon be groveling for jobs.    That said, we are snotty little reprobates, and we're still shielded enough from the real world to be able to give anyone back talk, particularly you. So here then is our thoroughly unbiased and utterly honest impression of your first week.   * Our generation isn't as cool as yours. But we think the show's on too late. Put it on earlier.   * Shave Max Weinberg's head. Bald band leaders are funny.   * When it's nice outside, maybe you could have the show outside just once.   * The talking Clinton and Schwarzenegger heads with the animated mouths are hilarious. Of course, Clutch Cargo's perfected it, but we won't say anything if you don't.   * When you tell a joke, say some of the words with italics. Works for us!   * The leg wrestling was funny and all, but we do not appreciate you displaying secret Lampoon rituals.   * You asked a trivia question about the Partridge family and the answer provided was \"we don't know.\" A disregard for learning is never funny.   * We laughed ourselves silly at your casting of Andy Richter as your sidekick. He does look exactly like that mean old Dean Phruple! Wink! Wink! Attaboy, Conan!   * And what's with this name change, \"Conan\"? We like you just fine with your given name, and you will always be Cy Kugenspiel in our hearts.   In summary, we think you're doing a great job. We're all really proud of you, and you're doing the Lampoon proud. But we know that any of us kids could do your job at least as well -- and we sleep better knowing this.

True natives -- about as rare there as Republicans or galoshes -- get teary-eyed hearing Jeanette MacDonald belt out, \"open your Golden Gate . . .\" The rest of us, refugees from the grimy East Coast or more exotic Asia, still have trouble believing that we can perch on the wind-scrubbed hillocks of this multicultural sand castle without paying for the privilege in foreign currency. The locale Dashiell Hammett used for his hard-boiled fiction is about the hardest place to get hardened in. After 20 years, I still get a chill scrawling the name of the city at the end of my return address; a detour up Nob Hill makes me want to put on black tie; the windmills beside Ocean Beach are pointed out to that invisible passenger along on my never-ending tour of eccentricities in Baghdad-by-the-Bay.\n\nEver wide-eyed, I recently made my first move in a decade -- going from a creaky Victorian upper flat in Noe Valley to a less charming but cozier postwar stucco sublet close by the New Chinatown of the Richmond. Like many others, I knew my new neighborhood only through brief dips into its unparalleled smorgasbord of ethnic restaurants. I'd previously dismissed this corridor to the ocean along the north flank of Golden Gate Park as somehow less than truly San Franciscan. After all, this is a precinct with no hills, no hippies, no painted ladies, as San Francisco's Victorian houses are called. A year later, I'd argue that no other section so accurately reflects the city where the United Nations was founded. In the place known to generations of Asian immigrants as Old Gold Mountain, the Richmond may be the most golden, the most Californian place of all. Certainly, it is the area that most persistently reminds us that our little Barbary Coast is but part of one interconnected metalopolis known as the Pacific Rim.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"In the Region/Westchester; Trading Development Rights for Goodwill","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-trading-development-rights-for-goodwill.html","abstract":"  ARRANGEMENTS in which developers relinquish some development rights on a piece of property in exchange for the goodwill of a community that might otherwise be hostile to the project are becoming more common, especially in conservation-minded communities like Bedford.

Look at the witty grace notes surrounding their suddenly violent honeymoon: a cop, realizing he is aiming his gun at a thug who speaks only Italian, growls, \"Come outta from behinda the couch\"; the man whose head is smashed is attacked in self-defense with the heavy lid of a toilet tank; one amateur killer actually drops a photo-ID at the scene of the crime.

The eight-city test, which began two weeks ago, is an expansion of Avis's program in Seattle, which was initiated last month. The cities involved are Portland, Me., Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, N.Y., Detroit, Minneapolis, Portland, Ore., and Seattle -- selected because tests indicate lights are most effective in northern latitudes.    The way was cleared for the plan in February, when the Department of Transportation issued a ruling that supersedes any state regulations that might have prohibited day running lights. The lights, which are less bright than regular headlights, have been required in Canada since the 1990 auto model year, and in Sweden since 1977. Based on research from these countries, and from tests with commercial fleets in the United States, most driving experts believe that the lights reduce the frequency of head-on and sideways collisions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"CONNECTICUT GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/nyregion/connecticut-guide-149493.html","abstract":"  29 ROLES IN 1 PLAY   Anna Deavere Smith plays the roles of 29 people in a Long Wharf Theater production of \"Fires in the Mirror,\" the playwright-actress's account of the events surrounding the violence in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in August 1991.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"Gregory Van Buren, Norma Brandon","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/style/weddings-gregory-van-buren-norma-brandon.html","abstract":"  Norma Kate Brandon, a daughter of Jacqueline Evans Brandon of Yorba Linda, Calif., and the late Col.

Serpent's Tail, paper, $12.99.  Ever since the Moorish invasions of Andalusia in the eighth century, North Africa has had a special significance for Spain; rightly or wrongly, it has come to symbolize one of the most exotic, least understood elements in the Spanish psyche. \"Mimoun,\" a slender first novel by the Valencian writer Rafael Chirbes, explores this otherness in the context of personal and social alienation. Originally published in Spain in 1988 and deftly translated by Gerald Martin, the novel recounts the adventures of Manuel, a bisexual Madrileno who spends the winter in Mimoun, a small Moroccan town near Fez. Mr. Chirbes's spare, impressionistic prose leads us through Manuel's desultory love affairs, his friends' dismal suicides, his exquisite sadness.

A food processor also speeds up the timing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"Peter Blue Is Falling Apart","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/books/peter-blue-is-falling-apart.html","abstract":"AT SEA\nBy Toby Olson.\n239 pp. New York:\nSimon & Schuster. $19.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"Hurricane Advice By Telephone","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/travel/travel-advisory-hurricane-advice-by-telephone.html","abstract":"  Hurricane season is here, and travelers planning trips to possible storm areas can call a new \"900\" telephone number for the latest advisories from forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"A New Order Rises At Bermuda Bowl","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/style/bridge-a-new-order-rises-at-bermuda-bowl.html","abstract":"  TWO lessons can be drawn from the NEC Bermuda Bowl competition, which ended Sept. 10 in Santiago, Chile. One is that many small countries are now big in bridge: the Netherlands beat Norway in the final, and neither country has ever done so well in a world team championship. One of the two American teams was eliminated in the quarterfinal, and the other in the semifinal. Britain, France and Italy did not qualify for the event.   Also notable was the age factor. The Norwegians had a 23-year-old player, and their average age was 34. The Dutch averaged 32. Their opponents were almost all older, suggesting that stamina is an important element in a 12-day marathon like the Bermuda Bowl.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"An Asian Home Away From Home","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/nyregion/neighborhood-report-flushing-an-asian-home-away-from-home.html","abstract":"  Lawrence Lin knows that his business associates don't want anything exotic when they come to town.

Similar ill treatment can also sabotage a propane-fueled barbecue.    For electrical items like hedge clippers, the most important storage requirement is that they be kept dry. If a device has to be stored outdoors or in a damp location, wrap it securely with plastic sheeting to protect it.  Electric equipment requires no storage maintenance other than surface cleaning and lubrication of mechanical parts like control cables. Do not try to lubricate parts of an electric motor unless the owner's manual says to.

Reporters and disk jockeys from all over the United States and as far away as Argentina were flown here to hear the 23-year-old singer discuss the making of the record (reported to have cost more than $1 million), watch him perform at a pair of sold-out concerts and see the premiere of a lavish, romantic music video, shot in three versions by three different directors.   Three months later, Luis Miguel, now in the midst of an American tour that took him to Madison Square Garden earlier this month and will peak in December with a five-day engagement at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., has proved to be worth every penny of that investment. Some 1.5 million copies of \"Aries\" have flown out of record stores throughout the Western Hemisphere, and the album's first single, \"Ayer,\" can be heard on radios everywhere Spanish is spoken. Once again, Luis Miguel -- a Mexican born in Puerto Rico of Spanish-Italian parents whose full name is Luis Miguel Gallego -- has been confirmed as Latin heartthrob numero uno, the Julio Iglesias of his generation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"'It's Not About Catching Fish'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/books/its-not-about-catching-fish.html","abstract":"FLY FISHING THROUGH THE MIDLIFE CRISIS\nBy Howell Raines.\nIllustrated. 352 pp. New York:\nWilliam Morrow & Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930919","headline":"When It Comes to Bullies, Skin Color Doesn't Matter","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/nyregion/l-when-it-comes-to-bullies-skin-color-doesn-t-matter-400793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I find it interesting that Ms. Bray, while addressing how racial stereotypes cut both ways, inadvertantly reveals a stereotype of her own.

The shop, on the main concourse, resembles a stainless-steel subway car, with display cases in place of the windows. The store sells miniature trains, old-style subway tokens and items designed around tokens, like key chains. The Transit Museum shop is to share its space in the terminal with a branch of the New York City Transit Authority Travel Information Center. Times Square Getting More Than Takeout    Times Square should soon be booming with big, new out-of-town restaurants. The Olive Garden, a chain of Italian restaurants, plans to open next summer at Broadway and 47th Street with a multi-level dining room that will seat almost 500 people. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, a New Orleans-based chain, plans to open this fall at 148 West 51st Street, and will seat 275. And in November, Morton's of Chicago, a steakhouse chain, is to open a 150-seat restaurant on 45th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues. A.T.& T. Riding High On Flushing Phone Parlor    Based on the success of its nine-month-old international calling center in Flushing, Queens, A.T.& T. expects to open more such centers around New York City soon. The Global Communications Center, at 39-02 Main Street in Flushing, has nine phone booths where people can place calls around the world. It caters to clients who have limited phone service at home and don't want to pay the much higher rates at a pay phone. And it has A.T.& T. translators on hand to help place calls.  For Minority-Owned Businesses    Minority-owned companies in the Bronx can seek advice from a new business assistance office. The United States Department of Commerce recently opened the Bronx Minority Business Development Center, which offers marketing, financial and management tips, and construction assistance. Minority-owned businesses in Rockland and Westchester Counties can also use the center, at 1020 Grand Concourse in the Bronx. Charges for management and technological assistance will be subsidized by the Department of Commerce.

Houghton Mifflin/Seymour Lawrence. $24.95.   Oscar Wilde once observed that \"the public is wonderfully tolerant; it forgives everything but genius.\" Yet the plot of Frank Conroy's irresistible new book suggests quite the opposite. A rich novel of development with the somewhat familiar title \"Body and Soul,\" it shows that the world can be wonderfully forgiving of genius, so forgiving as to prove a handicap.   From earliest childhood, Claude Rawlings's gift for music is recognized and rewarded. Though he spends most of his days dreamily roaming his Upper East Side neighborhood while his unmarried mother drives a taxi, his budding interest in the piano attracts the patronage of a local music-store owner, Aaron Weisfeld. Weisfeld steers Claude to the right teachers, who help him develop skills that lead to a job as an accompanist to the child of a Park Avenue family.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930920","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/20/nyregion/chronicle-036893.html","abstract":"  Starring in the film \"Bopha!,\" which opens on Friday, has particular resonance for DANNY GLOVER , and so does the cause, the Fund for Democratic Elections in South Africa, which is to benefit from a screening and party on Thursday.   \"There have been a number of fine films about South Africa, but this is the first time that a major studio is releasing a film about what the situation is for Africans from their point of view,\" Mr. Glover said the other day.

To be sure, other papers sent blacks to the campaign, but the numbers were underwhelming.   This bodes ill for diversity in journalism. Political reporting is still the proving ground for the columnists, foreign correspondents, Washington bureau chiefs and managing editors of the future.
