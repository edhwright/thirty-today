Slide Hampton's 12-piece orchestra, which provided many of the musicians for the United Nations Band led by Dizzy Gillespie last year, is presenting a memorial tribute to Gillespie this weekend. It features Mr. Hampton's arrangements of Gillespie's music, and the group includes one of the legendary trumpeter's most celebrated trumpet-playing followers, Jon Faddis, as well as the trumpeters Claudio Roditi and Roy Hargrove. The trombonists are Steve Turre, Douglas Purviance and Mr. Hampton; the saxophonists are Jimmy Heath, David Sanchez and Antonio Hart, and the rhythm section is made up of the pianist Danilo Perez, the bassist George Mraz and the drummer Lewis Nash. The band will be recorded tomorrow and Sunday by Tel-Arc Records. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is a $15 music charge and a $10 minimum.

Sabol, the head of New York City's Human Resources Administration, posed as a welfare applicant last year to experience firsthand the huge bureaucracy she administers. Ms. Sabol disclosed her odyssey through a process she found \"depersonalized\" and rife with indignities at a time of bitter feuding with a First Deputy Mayor. A1.   BACKERS LOBBY FOR SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR  Joseph A. Fernandez's supporters sought to rally backing for the Schools Chancellor before today's meeting of the Board of Education, a majority of whose members have said they are unwilling to renew his contract. B3.   CHINATOWN KIDNAPPING ENDS IN DEATH  It began as a kidnapping and armed robbery on a Chinatown street, an increasingly common crime in the Asian-American community. But a witness called relatives of the victims, who set up an ambush. When the kidnappers arrived at the victim's home in Manhasset, L.I., one was killed by an uncle of the victims, the Nassau County police said. B3.   A $200 TOLL TO CROSS THE HUDSON  In the latest skirmish in the trans-Hudson wars, officials in New Jersey said that they would begin charging New York City limousines and taxis $200 a year per vehicle for the right to bring passengers from New Jersey to New York. B3.   KELLY RESERVES JUDGMENT ON SHOOTOUT  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that it was too early to pass judgment on officers who responded to a bank robbery that devolved into a wild shootout on the Upper West Side, leaving a man and his hostage dead. Mr. Kelly suggested that new details reinforced that the situation was uncontrollable. B2.  A second homeless mentally ill man is ordered released from a mental hospital. B2.  REGION   ASSESSING HOSPITAL ORDER  A ruling by a Federal judge in Manhattan struck down a large part of New York's payment system, saying hospitals could no longer impose extra charges, a practice begun in 1983 when the state began regulating hospital rates. The ruling, if upheld, will deprive the hospitals of $160 million a year, make the position of the ailing Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield even more precarious, and, threaten to dismantle New York's complicated and fragile hospital financing system. News analysis, B5.    DEMOCRATS ANGERED BY WEICKER ADDRESS  The tone of Governor Weicker's budget address and his dismissal of an income-tax bill angered Democrats, who for the most part have been his allies, and may carry a high price, especially if he decides to seek a second term next year. B4.    CENSUS-TRACT PLAN SAID TO BE REVERSED  After a public outcry from Long Island officials and civic leaders, the Federal Government has agreed to reverse a decision that would have lumped Nassau and Suffolk Counties with New York and northern New Jersey in the same census tract, a Long Island Representative said.

In today's rock sound, voices survive within the anarchy of noise. The classic singer's stance, pushed up to the mike, overriding the guitars' dominance with wit and vigor, gives way to a deeply articulate quietism. Singers like Roxanne Stephen of Th' Faith Healers and Sarah Shannon of Velocity Girl never force their way to center stage, preferring to ride the junk-filled stream of their bands' music, their voices sometimes bobbing to the surface like lost treasure. Th' Faith Healers, who come from England, claim influence from outlaw progressive rockers like Can; the group's cacophony resolves into rich tones that pique the imagination.  Velocity Girl is part of the newest wave of American independents, and brews a gentle storm of dreamy melodies and feedback. The bands appear together tonight, sharing the bill with fellow groundbreakers Fuse and Prison Shake. Tickets are $9, and the first band goes on at 10 P.M. Bob Marley's Birthday     Bob Marley Day Celebration, the Ritz, 54th Street and Broadway, (212) 541-8900. Bob Marley remains a hero to progressive music lovers of all stripes, and his physical absence, now in its 12th year, hasn't shaken the power of his influence. Like many spiritual movements, Rastafarianism knows how to honor its holy ones.  This year's birthday party for Marley includes an appearance by his mother, Cedella Marley Booker; a set by the majestic singer Judy Mowatt, spins by the disk jockey Tony Rebel, a set featuring the old-time reggae star Denroy Morgan and his children, and a special all-star band organized by the Black Rock Coalition. Also not to be missed is new video of Marley, collected by Roger Steffens. It should be a righteous night of jamming, which reggae lovers will dedicate to a friend and leader whom they'll never forget. Tickets are $20 for general admission or $27 for reserved seating, available at the Ritz box office or through Ticketmaster. The festivities begin at 9 P.M. tomorrow; doors open at 8.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930205","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/05/nyregion/no-headline-270193.html","abstract":"  \"I ceased to be. -- BARBARA J.

Mr. Serrano has been a fashionable figure since right-wing protests against government financing of his art several years ago catapulted him onto the national stage as a martyr to freedom of expression. Moreover, he has seemed especially eager to push the sorts of hot buttons that give his art an air of urgency and risk. Having made works involving homelessness, the Ku Klux Klan, body fluids and the Roman Catholic Church, he has now turned his camera on a subject that, while timeless, could not be trendier or more sensationalistic in this era of AIDS and rampant street crime: death.   His new larger-than-life, glitzy photographs, taken in a morgue, offer close-ups of corpses -- a decomposed head here, a charred torso there, each belonging to some unidentified victim of disease or violence. With black backdrops and the hyped-up coloration of Cibachrome, the photos are at once calculated in their artsy presentation and also poorly carried out, promising an emotional impact without delivering more than an occasional shiver. They seem big not because the images demand it but because bigness is de rigueur nowadays for ambitious photography.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930205","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/05/nyregion/c-corrections-027593.html","abstract":"  A caption on Jan. 25 with a photograph by Brett Weston that appeared with his obituary omitted a credit.

But the disease has had a major impact in areas where those groups -- homosexuals, drug users, the poor and the undereducated -- are concentrated, like New York City, the study said. Strikes the Powerless    The study said groups with greater power remain relatively unaffected while AIDS \"is burrowing into socially disadvantaged segments of our society that may be ignored by the general population and by public policy.\" As a result, it said, there is the danger that attention may wane and that \"the disease may become accepted as one of the 'synergy of plagues' endemic in vulnerable communities.\"    AIDS \"will 'disappear,\" the council concluded, not because, like smallpox, it will have been eliminated, but because those who continue to be affected by it are \"socially invisible.\"   Thomas Brandt, an official of the National Commission on AIDS, said the report was \"on the mark\" because \"there has not been an appropriate level of response\" in America.   \"Many segments of society have not changed, but they need to,\" he said. \"While America will never be the same, some of our core institutions are continuing to do business as usual.\"   Among the study's conclusions about the extent of the effect of AIDS on social structures were these:   *Initially, public-health officials set aside conventional containment practices, like quarantine and mandatory testing, and developed control methods involving education. As the AIDS epidemic enters its second decade and settles firmly in minority groups, public-health officials are returning to more traditional practices, including screening to detect H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Education efforts, the study said, have resulted in wider acceptance of \"safe sex,\" including the use of condoms.   *Although AIDS has put a great strain on health-care resources in some communities, most areas have been able to absorb the new patients. About 2 percent of the nation's health expenditures are consumed by AIDS, and the disease has caused two health-care changes -- increased efforts to protect the nation's blood supply and a reassessment of ethical concerns among health-care workers treating patients with lethal infectious diseases.   *AIDS has instilled a new sense of urgency in developing and testing drugs and has led to fewer restrictions on testing drugs developed to compbat lethal diseases.   *Widespread voluntary action arose from the gay male population, which was most severely affected early in the AIDS epidemic. But as the epidemic becomes more centered in the poor communities, the resources of voluntary actions may grow smaller. Panel of 11 Experts    The National Research Council is part of the National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress to provide scientific advice to the Federal Government. The study was compiled by a committee of 11 experts and reviewed by organizations within the academy.   \"In the panel's judgment,\" the study said, \"the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic has affected many transient changes in the institutes we studied and relatively few changes that we expect to be permanent.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930205","headline":"Nets Return From Land Of the Big Blown Lead","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/05/sports/pro-basketball-nets-return-from-land-of-the-big-blown-lead.html","abstract":"  If the Nets want to be respected as contenders this season, they must beat elite teams like the Seattle SuperSonics, who came into tonight's game tied for the league's third-best record.

The inspections are needed to clear up discrepancies between what Pyongyang told the I.A.E.A. about its production of plutonium and what the agency discovered in its recent inspections. By searching through the North's nuclear plants and waste, inspectors can determine how long its research reactors have been running and how much plutonium they could have produced.

The ambitious Basquiat quickly left the streets, where he gained his first celebrity as a graffiti artist, for the studio, where he painted on a grand scale, both physically and emotionally. His brilliantly colored canvases were covered with anguished figures and sardonic printed phrases like \"Haloes fifty nine cent\" or \"Milk$;.\" In JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT (Whitney Museum of American Art/Abrams, $65), Richard Marshall, a curator at the Whitney Museum, analyzes Basquiat's iconography as the fruit of a voracious visual curiosity that took in everything from ancient Rhodesian rock art to product symbols. This handsome catalogue for a retrospective exhibit of Basquiat's work, which is at the Whitney through Feb. 14, contains essays by five critics, including Greg Tate of The Village Voice, who compares Basquiat to other black artists who combine words with images. The Yale art historian Robert Farris Thompson explores how Basquiat transformed \"music into paint\" in such densely detailed canvases as \"Zydeco.\" Basquiat's nervous calligraphy and flayed-looking figures, often depicted in attitudes of helpless exposure, contrast with his rich surfaces, as in \"Leonardo da Vinci's Greatest Hits.\" The artist's recognition of the depths of human dishonesty wrapped his works in an angry gloom, but his paintings' unflagging vitality stands in counterpoint, and marks Jean-Michel Basquiat as a quintessentially American painter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Arcade Owner And the Community","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/nyregion/l-arcade-owner-and-the-community-775093.html","abstract":"  After reading \"A Rare Oasis of Enjoyment Suffers a Moment of Doubt\"  [ Jan. 17 ]  about the decline in business at Space Plex, the amusement arcade in Nesconset following the alleged Katie Beers disappearance, I felt compelled to write.

When it moved from U.S. 1 in 1990 to a handsomely converted trolley barn in Norwalk, it changed its old-fashioned atmosphere to that of a simple, stylish Spanish country inn -- and the restaurant moved from Good to Very Good in this reviewer's opinion. Several dinners over a period of time and intensive visits in recent weeks lead one to move the rating once again -- to Excellent.    The Meson Galicia kitchen has shown a steady high consistency -- which is no easy feat -- a willingness to introduce new dishes and to tinker with old ones that didn't quite work. Though not on the winter menu, paella valenciana is the most obvious example. Formerly a somewhat mushy version of the Valencian classic, it now has the requisite chewy, almost nutty edge. A new interest in the Spanish version of nouvelle cuisine affects the beautiful plate presentations, though not the ample portions. Furthermore, the use of fresh, high quality ingredients shines through in each dish.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Melinda Duryea, Alexander Draper","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/style/engagements-melinda-duryea-alexander-draper.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. James M.

Seven years after routing the annual spring onslaught of students by, among other things, stopping advertising in university newspapers and prohibiting sleeping on the beach, Fort Lauderdale has been reinvented as a sophisticated community with year-round vitality. The Fort Lauderdale of the 1990's has more in common with the Riviera of Hitchcock's \"To Catch a Thief\" than with that defining beach classic (shot at Fort Lauderdale Beach), \"Where the Boys Are.\" \n\nThe beach renovation is a striking, six-year, $26 million project, that, in essence, moved automobiles away from the beach in favor of landscaping and pedestrian access. Meanwhile, downtown, away from the beach and busy, parallel highway A1A, a sophisticated and vital hub flourishes with sidewalk cafes, elegant boutiques, a riverfront park and ambitious new museums and performing arts facilities. Whole derelict neighborhoods that withered in the 1970's and 80's with the expansion west, toward the Everglades, of residential tracts and massive shopping malls, are being reclaimed. A new international airport brings visitors from Germany and Scandinavia, Britain and Canada. \nEvents\n\n The two-year-old Broward Center for the Performing Arts has become a magnet for visiting theatrical presentations and performers of the first rank. Tomorrow, devotees of classical music will be treated to a concert by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. On March 4 and 5, principal dancers of the New York City Ballet will present a tribute to George Balanchine and, on March 22, the Montreal Symphony comes to town. Also on the schedule are touring companies of Broadway hits, like \"The Secret Garden,\" March 9 to 21, and \"Cats,\" April 20 to 25. For jazz and pop aficionados, highlights include the Chieftains, March 3, and the New River Jazz Festival April 2 to 4. Tickets range from $10 to $55.

And yes, by all means let us have empathetic studies of 17th-century alchemists (one of whom was Isaac Newton), but do we have to allow modern-day adherents of 17th-century alchemy to pass laws favoring equal time for their beliefs in chemistry textbooks?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Car Import Duty Can Only Hurt U.S. Economy; No to Gas Tax Hike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/opinion/l-car-import-duty-can-only-hurt-us-economy-no-to-gas-tax-hike-850693.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Reading Mr. Clinton's Lips\" (editorial, Jan. 28), on the Federal budget deficit and taxation, incorrectly asserts that there is a \"sudden enthusiasm\" by the American Petroleum Institute \"for a national sales tax rather than a gasoline tax increase.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Gaudy News, With New Twists","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/nyregion/l-gaudy-news-with-new-twists-769593.html","abstract":"  Come off it.

Here are some of the 49-year-old coach's comments: Early Days    I was raised six miles outside of Americus, Ga., on a 275-acre farm. The early part of my life, all I can remember is working on the farm. I have an older brother, Charles, an older sister, Joanne, and a younger brother, Butch. When you're raised on a farm, you have an awful lot of chores. We had hogs and cows, and we were also row-crop farmers: peanuts, cotton, corn, wheat and oats. We had gardens and raised our own fruits and vegetables. There was a lot of work, but it was a great way to be raised.

Typically, the subjects are anonymous, hard-working Americans oppressed by corporate greed. \"Harlan County, U.S.A.\" (1976) was an emotional portrait of striking Kentucky coal miners abused by a power company. \"American Dream\" (1990) was a parable of the decline of union power as illustrated by a strike by meatpackers in Minnesota. Both films won Academy Awards.    Now Ms. Kopple has unexpectedly aimed her blue-collar sensibility at Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion who is serving a six-year prison sentence in Indiana for the rape of a beauty pageant contestant.

Its legacy persists in the discriminatory treatment of black citizens by whites, which derives from the unspoken view that Africans could not have been enslaved if they were not somehow inferior. Mr. Hacker cites research and statistical evidence showing that blacks have never achieved full equality, and that indeed whites fear the consequences of allowing them to do so. Last year our reviewer, Tom Wicker, praised Mr. Hacker's \"calm, analytical eye, his unblinking view of American history and his unwillingness to accept cant and 'common sense' as facts.

The works of 20th-century Latin American artists are featured, along with Hispanic-inspired works by non-Hispanic artists.   The show is based on a quincentennial \"Spanish Steps\" program introduced into the school's curriculum in 1991, focusing on the historic and cultural ties between the United States, Latin America and Spain.   Jean Charlot, now dead, whose work is on view, was born in France in 1898 but moved to Mexico in the 1920's and was a founder of the Mexican Mural Renaissance. He collaborated with Diego Rivera on mural projects in the 30's, and he painted portraits of many of his artist friends, including David Siqueiros and Jose Orozco.   Antonio Frasconi came to New York City from Uruguay in the 1940's on a scholarship to the Art Students League. His work as a printmaker and illustrator is known worldwide. He is now distinguished teaching professor of art at the State University of New York at Purchase.   Gabriela de la Vega, a native of Mexico, studied in Manhattan, Paris and Los Angeles and has an established reputation as a watercolorist and illustrator. Antonio Martorelli was born in Puerto Rico and studied in Madrid. He is a performance artist, writer and teacher as well as an illustrator and set designer.   Constance Del Vecchio Maltese is a native New Yorker and a member of the Society of Illustrators. She is best known for her portrait series of the great explorers, including Columbus, Magellan, Marco Polo and others, on view at the U.S.S. Intrepid Sea-Air Space Museum.   Alton Tobey, an American whose work is in the collections of major museums in the United States and Europe, contributed his portraits of several notable Mexican individuals painted during his 35 trips there.   More than 100 works of art in various media can be seen through Feb. 21. The school is at 100 Overlook Circle; visiting hours are tomorrow through Friday of this week from 3 to 6 P.M., and Saturday through Feb. 21 from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. For more information, call 632-8836. CONCERTS FOR SINGLES    \"Musique d'Amour,\" one of the Symphony Singles concerts by the New Orchestra of Westchester, designed as get-togethers for music lovers who have no spouses or significant others, will be held today at 3 P.M. in the West Room at Reid Castle of Manhattanville College in Purchase. The concert features Chris Calloway, daughter of Cab Calloway, in a program of songs by George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Irving Berlin. Ms. Calloway will be accompanied on the piano by Kevin O'Connell.   A reception and refreshments will follow the program. Tickets are $25 at the door. ARROWWOOD VALENTINE    A bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates will welcome Valentine getaway weekenders at the Doral Arrowwood in Rye Brook. Special rates of $129 a room for each night are offered on Friday and Sunday, $139 on Saturday. Buffet breakfasts are included.   Some special programs begin with a cocktail reception Friday evening. A Saturday-morning aerobic workout will be followed by a workshop on techniques for body massages, and a cooking workshop is scheduled for Saturday afternoon with Paul McCarthy, the executive chef. He will demonstrate how to prepare heart-shaped dishes for two. Admission of $20 for one or two people includes take-home recipes and aprons.   Saturday evening's candlelight dinner will cost $28 a person and include dancing to a jazz ensemble, roses for the women, and a complimentary glass of champagne. A four-course Italian menu, with wines selected for each course, will be served on Sunday night for $50 a person. The number to call for more information or reservations is 939-5500. FAMILY ART WORKSHOPS    Every Sunday from noon to 2:30 P.M., beginning today through May 23, two-hour family art workshops will be in progress at the Caramoor Center in Katonah.   The program, which takes advantage of the educational opportunities inherent in the architecture, furnishings, decorative and fine arts of Caramoor's House Museum, its outbuildings and landscaped grounds, was devised by Evelyn Albert, the new director of education and former museum educator at the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan.   Today's subject is stick puppets of the Renaissance, which the children and adults will make after touring the Music Room -- filled with Renaissance treasures -- and listening to music of the period.   Next Sunday's project is the making of a commedia dell'arte mask for Valentine's Day, based on an orientation tour of the museum. Workshops on such subjects as animals in architectural and decorative detail, door knockers, elaborate hats, and book-making are to be offered in future sessions.   The series is suitable for children from 4 through 11, accompanied by a parent or other adult. The fee for each workshop of $6 for adults and $4 for children includes materials. For reservations or more information, the number to call is 232-5035.

In the last five years, corporations pinched by the recession have been withdrawing sponsorship for these series, which cost up to $1 million a year to produce. And many classical-radio programmers have come to see the concerts as a nuisance rather than a boon.   These broadcasts are important for many reasons. They offer newcomers to classical music large samplings of repertory in unvarnished performances and a concert context. They allow more devoted listeners to track the progress and programming of orchestras around the country, and with concert tickets selling for as much as $55, they give radio eavesdroppers something for nothing. They introduce new conductors and soloists.

Warm and witty, the king and queen crown hats -- sold by a sidewalk vendor in SoHo -- are made of soft, crushable fabric and are decorated with beads. Felt cloches from the Far East are embroidered with seashells. One of the real head-turners is the hat that looks like a pair of gloves, each hand a different color. Even the conventional candy-striped stocking cap has evolved, and now sprouts a tassel. One woman strutted in a hat made from the black tail feathers of a rooster.

Many had made New Year's resolutions to get slimmer in 1993; now they were trying to stick to those resolutions any way they could.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Sheryl L.

Le Corbusier haunts not only the forms of Canal Plus but also its site, formerly the location of Citroen's car factories.

And though their interpretations were different, they had a shared purpose: they treated the blues as art music, as opposed to popular music.   The two composers approached the music in a new way, one not identified with the European classical world of Mozart or Beethoven, though undeniably classical. Their conception was based on a classical model whose elements are simplicity, durability, cultural importance and critical consensus. Blues, not the genre but the form, looks as if it's going to outlast many of the cultural products of the 20th century.

He was armed with youth, idealism -- and a camera. From the moment he met James Forman, the executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- who promptly put him to work photographing the segregated drinking fountains in an Albany, Ga., courthouse -- Mr. Lyon became S.N.C.C.'s first staff photographer, the visual historian of the movement.

There is also a photograph of shattered stained-glass windows, hanging loose like broken limbs, in the Birmingham, Ala., church where a 1963 bombing killed four adolescent girls.

The hunt is a model of its kind, in that everyone gets a prize of one sort or another. We can't take the prize home, but it will become part of our being, never to be forgotten.   How to get started? Nothing could be easier. You walk up the main staircase. At the top, you make a 90-degree turn to the left, and there before you is a long, narrow space, lately remodeled, that is called the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Gallery. The arrival of this gallery signals a radical and welcome change in regard to what is sometimes thought of as a secretive, not to say clandestine, operation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Turkey's Monument to a Goddess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/travel/turkey-s-monument-to-a-goddess.html","abstract":"  WHEN a young archeologist visited the Turkish village of Geyre in 1959, he found modern houses supported by Corinthian columns. For years villagers plowing this fertile spot overlooking the Menderes River Valley in southwestern Turkey had been turning up rubble from an earlier civilization and putting it to modern uses. Elaborately carved marble sarcophagi served as handsome watering troughs for sheep and as vats for pressing grapes into homemade wine.    Modern inhabitants, who rode their donkeys beside the majestic columns that were still standing, passed along a legacy of the ancient city of Aphrodisias. According to legend, the Greeks and Romans built this ornate marble metropolis to honor Aphrodite, the goddess of love, life and fertility. But it took more than 30 years of excavations to provide a portrait of the extensive cultural center, complete with a stadium that could hold 30,000 spectators, centrally heated Roman baths and workshops where sculptors elevated marble-carving to a high art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Keeping Would-Be Doctors' Dreams Alive","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/nyregion/keeping-would-be-doctors-dreams-alive.html","abstract":"  EVERY Saturday, Galia Lyn, a 17-year-old junior at Mount Vernon High School, forgoes part of her weekend in favor of a sixth full day of school.
