The genesis of the chorus, now based in Montclair, N.J., lies in the imprisonment and later exile of Cossack troops from the Don region of Russia early in the 20th century. Throughout it all, they sang. And clearly music continues to be an artistic avocation followed as devoutly as any religion or profession. To watch George Margitich, the conductor, move quietly behind the singers giving them their pitch at the start of each song is to see ritual pure and simple.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941027","headline":"In 1994, What Draws Eyes?

This is Mr. Kerrey's response to an association's advertisement featuring the actor Charlton Heston, who asserted: \"You said you wouldn't vote for gun bans. But you went to Washington and voted for the first Federal gun ban in American history.\" PRODUCER Struble/Totten Communications ON THE SCREEN Opens with men on a shooting range, with red letters declaring, \"A Message to Charlton Heston from Bob Kerrey.\" The camera zooms in on Mr. Kerrey, dressed in hunting garb, as he fires at a clay pigeon. As he talks into the camera, he ejects the shell from the shotgun he just used, and then, midway through, puts the gun down and picks up another weapon. SCRIPT An announcer says, \"A message for Charlton Heston from Senator Bob Kerrey.\" Then Mr. Kerrey says: \"I'm a hunter, and I believe in the constitutional right to bear arms. When it's time to hunt birds, you need a good gun like this Ruger Red Label. Twenty-five years ago, in the war in Vietnam, people hunted me. They needed a good weapon -- like this AK-47. But you don't need one of these to hunt birds.\" The announcer then says: \"Bob Kerrey. The courage to lead.\" ACCURACY The distinction Mr. Kerrey draws is correct. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that the semi-automatic version of the AK-47 would be covered by the ban in the crime bill, which covers 19 types of semi-automatic weapons. The spokesman also said that shotguns like the Ruger Red Label would be unaffected by the ban. SCORECARD The ad is a tough response to a tough attack: Mr. Kerrey deals head-on with the charge that his support for a ban on semi-automatic weapons was a sellout of Nebraska hunters and gun owners. By word and message, he is trying to tell hunters that he is one of them. And, as is often the case with Mr. Kerrey, his background as a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he lost a leg and won the Medal of Honor, gives a political argument an emotional punch.

The bust of Houdini gracing the monument is a replacement, the original having been stolen long ago. But many of the sites associated with his life and work survive around New York City.\n\nHoudini has become an icon, a name known around the globe, a figure dangling upside down in a straitjacket or plunged into a Water Torture Cell. But Harry Houdini is also a historical figure, an immigrant boy who turned 21 in the 1890's. And though he was born in Hungary and achieved much of his greatest fame in Europe, Houdini went through life a New Yorker. It was in New York that he grew up, kept house and was buried, and in New York, the country's premier magic city, that he presided over the national magic scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941028","headline":"On Stage, and Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/theater/on-stage-and-off.html","abstract":"  The Drought of Leading Men    Lincoln Center Theater has dropped \"Tonight at 8:30,\" a two-night cycle of seven Noel Coward one-act plays, from its Broadway plans this year.

It works better than you'd think. For kids, there are relentless special effects, from a spaceship that looks like a flying pyramid to spears that turn into rocket launchers. For adults, there is a smartly designed parallel universe that echoes the Egypt of old Bible movies, and the appearance of Jaye Davidson (the androgynous star of \"The Crying Game\") as the sun god, Ra. Try to imagine him voguing around a party at the Temple of Dendur and you'll have the right image. Juggling all this makes \"Stargate\" move more slowly than any action movie should, but it has plenty of enticing moments.   The story begins in Giza, Egypt, in 1928, when archeologists discover a large stone wheel with mysterious symbols carved on it. Leaping to the present, we see James Spader as an Egyptologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson, being laughed off the podium when he suggests that the Egyptians didn't build the pyramids.

Dealing with oddities is the band's strength, presenting pieces where the music and the words either don't quite add up or come to strange conclusions. Unlike \"Gangster of Love\" and most mainstream pop, which rely on a strong sense of first-person narrative, They Might Be Giants songs dispense with ego entirely. Everything is a joke, or elliptical, or hidden behind a persona; a sense of the absurd fuels the band in every aspect except the craft of the music itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941029","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/29/us/inside-666122.html","abstract":"  Bishops Act on Role of Nuns   A Roman Catholic synod said that nuns would have a bigger role in the church, but still appeared to exclude them from top-level jobs.

Pettengill Is Second: Steve Pettengill of Middletown, R.I., aboard Hunter's Child, arrived in Cape Town yesterday, nailing down second place in Class I (50-60 feet) for the first leg of the BOC Challenge solo around-the-world race. It was the highest placing by an American in BOC Class I. Isabelle Autissier of France, the first-place finisher, completed the 6,818-mile Charleston-Cape Town run last Saturday.  HARNESS RACING  Lookout Victory Wins  Lookout Victory, driven by John Patterson Jr., won the $334,000 Cadillac Breeders Crown 2-year-old filly trot at Woodbine Race Course in Rexdale, Ontario, last night. Trailing early, Lookout Victory went outside and passed Sensible Lady at the half-mile mark, and took command, winning by six-and-one-quarter lengths in 1:572/5 . In other races, Eager Seelster won the $384,500 2-year-old colt trot by one length over a hard-charging Armbro Nash. Yankee Cashmere, driven by Peter Wrenn, won the $501,400 2-year-old filly pace by two lengths, beating Hattie in a wild run down the stretch in 1:56. Jennas Beach Boy, driven by Bill Fahy, captured the $670,700, 2-year-old colt final in 1:514/5 by four lengths. (AP) CROSS-COUNTRY  Dartmouth Dominates  Sam Wilbur, a senior from Lincoln, Maine, registered a 40-yard victory over teammate Ted FitzPatrick in the Heptagonal Games and led Dartmouth to the team title at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Wilbur, who was second last year, finished the 5-mile race in 24 minutes 47 seconds, and FitzPatrick's time was 24:55. Laura Woeller, a junior from Fulton, N.Y., successfully defended her women's 3.1-mile title in 18:14 but failed to lead Cornell to its fourth straight team crown as Dartmouth prevailed with 46 points.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941029","headline":"A Mystery Death and a Larceny Arrest","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/29/nyregion/a-mystery-death-and-a-larceny-arrest.html","abstract":"  For the last three months, people who live near the red brick building at 340 East 31st Street in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn wondered what had happened to Anne Wolowitz, a 90-year-old woman who had lived for decades in a small apartment on the fourth floor.   On July 21, she followed her routine of calling several times to a local meals program for the homebound elderly, grilling people there about when her food would be delivered. When she failed to call on July 22, the police were called and the apartment was searched, but Miss Wolowitz was not found.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941029","headline":"Bridge; How should partner respond to a takeout double?
