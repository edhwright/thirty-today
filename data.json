The first installment focused on Manhattan; the second on Queens. Because it is so large, Brooklyn has been split in two, with Flatbush Avenue as a natural divider. Taken as a whole, the area west of Flatbush has distinct characteristics, with less of the sweeping poverty of several neighborhoods to the east -- Bushwick, East New York and Brownsville. The emphasis of concerns differs by neighborhood -- traffic and parking in the northwest; loitering by youths in the southwest; flooding in Coney Island and Brighton Beach. Illegal dumping is raising anger; drugs keep people in fear, particularly around housing projects. Not all issues are mentioned in the map. It is simply a sampling of views of residents, merchants, police and community board officials. East of Flatbush will be examined next. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, DOWNTOWN, BOERUM HILL 1.

The book is less a thoroughgoing analysis of musical technique than an anecdotal medley of the observations of a master. Vocalists who influenced him include the usual pantheon of gods (Bessie, Billie, Frank, Bing, Nat, Ella, Louis) and grandes dames (Ethel Waters, Mabel Mercer, Connee Boswell, Helen Forrest), as well as a few artists not known primarily for their singing: Johnny Mercer, Woody Herman, Fred Astaire. A gifted arranger and composer as well as a pre-eminent performer of American popular music, Mr. Torme displays the extent of his musicianship as he discusses the songwriters, instrumentalists, arrangers, bandleaders, vocal groups, Broadway and film vocalists and scat singers who are among his \"role models almost too numerous to mention.\" I was fascinated to read that he numbers among his \"heroes and heroines\" the offstage Hollywood singers who were the \"voices of the stars\" in the film musicals of the 1940's, 50's and 60's: Anita Ellis, Carole Richards, Martha Mears, Marni Nixon, Buddy Clark and others. (We learn that Robert McFerrin, father of the pop star Bobby McFerrin, was the singing voice of Sidney Poitier in the 1959 film \"Porgy and Bess.\") Mr. Torme, whose previous books include portraits of Buddy Rich (\"Traps, the Drum Wonder\") and Judy Garland (\"The Other Side of the Rainbow\"), remains a musician first and a writer second; no one reading \"My Singing Teachers\" will advise him to give up his night job. But those who have admired the modesty, generosity and taste he has displayed as a singer will find many of those same qualities in this book. PATRICIA T.

By the time Etta bought her last Picasso 44 years later, she and her older sister, Claribel, had filled their Baltimore apartment with some 3,000 art objects, among which were now-legendary masterpieces of 20th-century art, including Matisse's \"Blue Nude\" (1907), Gauguin's \"Woman With a Mango\" (1892) and Cezanne's drop-dead \"Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen From the Bibemus Quarry\" (circa 1897).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941030","headline":"Making Spas On Ships Safer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/travel/practical-traveler-making-spas-on-ships-safer.html","abstract":"  THE Federal Government is planning to start regulating whirlpool spas on cruise ships.

The outbreak, the first aboard a cruise ship, resulted in one death, 16 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease and 34 additional cases of pneumonia among passengers on nine cruises.

YBOR CITY CHRONICLES: A Memoir (University Press of Florida, $24.95), Ferdie Pacheco's nostalgic account of his childhood in the late 1930's and early 1940's in the Latin quarter of Tampa, Fla., can confidently be called a stretcher. One senses that after 50 years, Dr. Pacheco has allowed the espresso to grow a bit stronger, the Cuban bread crustier and the neighborhood characters more intriguing. After all, as Dr. Pacheco, a television boxing commentator and Muhammad Ali's former physician, describes it, Ybor City's blend of cultures and classes proved fertile ground for mythmaking. There was, for example, the legendary figure of Sweet Sam, an elegant delivery man who owned a grand piano but mysteriously refused to play it. Dr. Pacheco's father also looms large, demanding Old World respect from his family. The author describes the restaurants, social clubs and movie theaters that serve as the backdrop for his memories. His stories are bolstered by photographs and his own cartoons, so the reader can actually see the place as he saw it. Dr. Pacheco is enthralled by the memory of a neighborhood of family and friends inextricably tied together by custom, values and concerns. It is these traits that make his anecdotes worth relating.

Situated 52 miles east of San Juan and 12 miles west of St. Thomas, Culebra is a lovely, rather rustic part of the Puerto Rican commonwealth consisting of 7,000 acres (including surrounding cays) and 1,600 inhabitants.  Like Vieques, a sister island nine miles to the south, Culebra attracts sun worshippers from the continental United States in winter and vacationers from the \"big island\" of Puerto Rico in summer. Its powdery beaches also lure several varieties of sea turtle, including the giant leatherback, the largest of all marine reptiles. Between February and July, leatherback females, averaging 6 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds, clamber onto Culebra's shores at night to deposit their eggs before returning to the water to undertake a long and (to humans) mysterious migration from the Caribbean Sea to colder waters.    Unlike other sea turtles, of which there are seven species in all according to the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington, leatherbacks venture into open ocean and frigid latitudes. They dive more than 4,000 feet -- even deeper than whales -- to procure jellyfish, their major food source. The carapace that gives them their name also sets them apart from greens, hawksbills, loggerheads, and ridleys, turtles whose carapace is made of bone.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941030","headline":"POSTINGS: State Report; Rent Regulation From 1943 to '93","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/realestate/postings-state-report-rent-regulation-from-1943-to-93.html","abstract":"  On Nov. 1, 1943, the Federal Office of Price Administration issued regulations freezing New York City rents at their March 1, 1943, levels.

And besides the stripped-down plans that bear little resemblance to Mr. Whittle's original vision of 1,000 private schools, built from scratch, there is one other major change as the company searches for financing. With the collapse or forced sale of Mr. Whittle's other ventures and the ensuing harsh publicity, it has become clear that to attract financing, Edison must almost surely persuade potential investors that the man who gave Edison life will have little or no ability to shape its future.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941030","headline":"Colleen M.

Rollins is as busy as ever.   In California, Mr. Rollins is helping direct the Senate campaign of Representative Michael Huffington, a Republican, against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat in her first term.    In Washington State, Mr. Rollins is trying to unseat House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, another Democrat, and replace him with a lawyer from Spokane, George Nethercutt. And in New York, Mr. Rollins is championing the campaign of Bernadette Castro, a political neophyte, against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.   Mr. Rollins set off a storm after Mrs. Whitman's victory when he boasted that he had pulled the election out of the bag, in part, by suppressing the black vote in urban and largely Democratic areas. Mr. Rollins contended that he had set aside $500,000 in \"walking around money\" that he instructed the campaign to use in the final days before the election to bribe black ministers to keep them from making endorsements from their pulpits for Gov. Jim Florio, who was seeking re-election.   Under pressure from Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Rollins quickly recanted, calling his statement a fit of bravado. Inquiries by Federal and state grand juries failed to turn up evidence to prove the initial statement.   Except for the uproar Mr. Rollins would be making an encore visit this year to New Jersey. The Republican Senate candidate, Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian, had asked Mr. Rollins to work in his campaign, but swiftly backed out when the controversy broke.   Mention of the issue still raises rancor in many quarters.   \"I don't think the outrage of the Rollins affair has dampened whatsoever,\" said Walter L. Fields Jr., political director for the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  \"We haven't forgotten the Rollins incident. But most of us have put it in the back of our minds, because we have been concentrating on other problems.\"   Mr. Rollins returned to New Jersey in June to meet black ministers and issue a private and a public apology, which the ministers accepted.   \"We can forgive,\" said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson of the St. Matthew African Methodist Episcopal Church in Orange. \"But forgiving is not forgetting.\"   But there are harsher feelings about Mr. Rollins.   \"Rollins was a liar, and you don't have people lie on you and feel good about it,\" said Donald Tucker, an at-large member of the Newark City Council and the chairman of the New Jersey Black Issues Convention, a coalition of black elected officials, businessmen and civic leaders. \"The damage that he has done will outlive him.

He surely could have been a justice of the Supreme Court. Although it is not too late for the Court, there seems only one certain way for him to claim an exalted place in the history books. That is to have a memorably successful fourth term.    This newspaper thinks he can do that. We not only recommend his re-election; we urge it as essential to New York's progress. We are mindful of his shortcomings and we are sometimes annoyed by the gap between the Cuomo rhetoric and the Cuomo reality.

Tea consists of canapes, sandwiches, warm biscuits or scones, a choice of soup or salad, and dessert that might be brownies, tarts or cake.

Rows of somber little black-and-white photographs, lined up on racks that look like stylized gutters, scarcely throb with the poetry that architects like Carlo Scarpa, Pier Luigi Nervi, Gio Ponti and Franco Albini brought to modern architecture at midcentury. Still, the show (on view until Jan. 22) can bring on a serious case of period envy. What is most enviable about the presentation is not the quality of individual buildings designed in the postwar decades. It is the extent to which the period produced a sense of itself as a period: an era when architects believed that they were collectively shaping a time and place.   That faith, a cornerstone of the modern movement, has largely disappeared from architecture today. Where architects once drew meaning from being part of something larger than themselves, many now derive it from the distance they can place between themselves and their contemporaries. Certainly there has been no shortage of architectural movements since 1968; indeed, so many have come and gone that even the tireless chronicler Charles Jencks has grown weary of tracking them.

Compare the measurements with a cord to compare prices.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941030","headline":"Getting the Led Out of Led Zeppelin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/arts/pop-music-getting-the-led-out-of-led-zeppelin.html","abstract":"  IN THE 1970's, LED ZEPPELIN almost single-handedly gave rock-and-roll not a bad name, but a worse name. It added \"heavy\" to the lexicon of adjectives used to describe rock music, developed a reputation for wild, destructive hotel parties, raked in larger percentages of profits than any band before it and turned an uncompromisingly long song, the eight-minute \"Stairway to Heaven,\" into the most popular tune on radio.    Fourteen years after the quartet broke up, as a result of the alcohol-related death of John Bonham, its drummer, Led Zeppelin's music remains a backdrop to the high school years of teen-agers everywhere. The group's classic guitar riffs have been hammered indelibly not just into the music of many rap and rock bands but the consciousness of anybody who has ever been near a sound system in the last three decades.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941030","headline":"Held Over: Russian Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/theater/theater-held-over-russian-politics.html","abstract":"  LEV DODIN HAS A PROBLEM WITH politics.

Just let him stage a production like \"Gaudeamus,\" with its brutal vignettes of the pettiness, absurdity and evil of Soviet Army life, and his audiences bring politics into it.

Mr. Mascis is the crown prince of slackers: he functions at the lowest energy level possible in interviews, on the stage and in life. Life, if one is to believe Mr. Mascis' songs of dashed hopes and heartbreak, is an ever-widening wound that is best borne under heavy anesthesia.   On Friday, Mr. Mascis summed up this philosophy best in \"Feel the Pain,\" from his new album \"Without a Sound\" (Sire). \"I feel the pain of everyone,\" he sang in a cracking, sleepy voice. \"Then I feel nothing.\" The juxtaposition between these two extreme states seemed to be a guiding principle for Mr. Mascis throughout the show.

It was cold, windy and rainy at Soldier Field on this Halloween night, but none of that was as chilling to the Chicago Bears as the whipping dispensed by the Green Bay Packers. The Bears started slowly and finished that way. The Packers started with a few slips but finished upright, thwarting the Bears by 33-6. - \"I've never played in conditions like that. It was like playing in Hurricane Camille, except it was 80 degrees cooler,\" said Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, who ran for one touchdown and passed for another. \"It was unbelievable. I went out in pregame and said, 'I might not complete a pass,' and I almost lived up to it.\"   Green Bay led by 14-0 at halftime and never looked back in scoring the game's first 27 points. The finishing touches were a 1-yard, third-quarter run by Edgar Bennett and, in the final quarter, a Bennett 13-yard score on a swing pass from Favre and a 9-yard scoring run by Reggie Cobb. For Bennett, it was a three-touchdown night.   Chicago -- which entered this game averaging only 18.4 points scored per game and had not scored more than 22 points in any game this season -- knew it was in trouble after falling behind, regardless of the terrible weather.   Quarterback Erik Kramer was ineffective and was replaced by Steve Walsh to begin the second half. Walsh finally connected, in between the Packers final two touchdowns -- with receiver Jeff Graham on a 5-yard pass that was the Bears' only score.   In this huge game for strong midseason standing in the National Football Conference Central race, Chicago slipped to a 4-4 record and Green Bay matched that mark. Both are tied with Detroit for second place behind the Minnesota Vikings (6-2).   There was one highlight for the Bears: at halftime, in an upbeat ceremony, the numbers of the Bears greats Dick Butkus and Gale Sayers were retired. Chicago finished with five turnovers, the Packers with none.   This was not a game for the faint of heart. At kickoff, the temperature was 43 degrees, the winds gusted up to 53 miles an hour and the windchill factor made the temperature seem 8 degrees. The Bears had their 91st consecutive sellout -- admittedly with 19,563 no-shows -- but more than half the crowd had left by halftime because of the weather.   It was an important and emotional game for Steve McMichael. For the last 23 meetings between these two teams, McMichael had lined up at defensive tackle for the Bears. This time, the 15-year pro, because of a free agent move to Green Bay in the off season, was on the line for the Packers.   It figured that the team that could establish a running game and stick with it would have the upper hand early and late in this 149th clash between the colorful rivals. Turnovers, however, played as large a role in the Packers rumbling to a 14-0 halftime lead.   The Packers found the running on the left side to their liking. The matchup there was left tackle Ken Ruettgers, left guard Guy McIntyre and center Frank Winters versus the Bear right end Alonzo Spellman and right tackle Chris Zorich. It was a matchup the Packers steadily won, with that left side leading Green Bay to a 223-94 lead in rushing yardage.   Favre was 0 for 7 passing until late in the third quarter but he scampered for 36 yards down the right sideline and dove in on the final yard for the touchdown and a 14-0 Green Bay lead with 4:46 left in the half.

The question is far from academic, some scientists say, given the possibility that heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide could destabilize today's climate system.   The climate of the last interglacial period, which at least in its early stages was somewhat warmer than the present interglacial period, fluctuated widely in spans of decades or even less, scientists reported 15 months ago on the basis of climatic changes recorded in corings taken from the Greenland ice cap. But six months later, another group of scientists analyzing another Greenland ice sample suggested that the last interglacial period, which began around 130,000 years ago and lasted 10,000 years by most reckonings, appeared stable after all. They said the first ice sample apparently had been distorted when the bottom of the flowing glacier from which it was taken passed over uneven ground.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19941101","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/nyregion/metro-digest-687596.html","abstract":"  MISCONDUCT INQUIRY AT WEST POINT   Five members of the United States Military Academy's football team are to face an inquiry at West Point after being accused of groping female cadets who were part of a pep rally crowd that ran past a cordon of football players at the Academy's game-week festivities.
