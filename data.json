Using laboratory techniques that were unavailable at the time of her death in 1985, scientists have performed an autopsy on her brain and come up with a surprising finding.   The researchers said they had expected to learn that the most severe brain damage leading to Ms. Quinlan's persistent vegetative state was in the cortex, the gray outer layer where many higher brain functions take place, because autopsies on others in this state had shown extensive damage in that area. But contrary to expectations, the new autopsy found that the major damage was to the thalamus, a structure that is deep in the brain and whose role is less well defined. There was no damage to the brain stem, which controls heartbeat, breathing and other vital functions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940526","headline":"As Senators Go, So Go College Presidents","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/l-as-senators-go-so-go-college-presidents-213560.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Why I Am Leaving the Senate\" (Op-Ed, May 13) by Senator David Boren, I predict:","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Why Economic Systems Need Overhaul","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/l-why-economic-systems-need-overhaul-213756.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   No political-economic system or theory is applicable at all times to all situations.

But the details, and the money to actually make good on the cuts, was left to future lawmakers.   The 23-to-11 vote, following approval by the House of Representatives last week, is predicated on the belief that the huge loans taken by the state to pay off its accumulated deficit in 1991 will gradually be paid off as the decade closes out. The cuts would phase in over eight years as that debt is paid off.  Republicans Are Critical    Republican opponents in the Democratic-controlled legislature criticized the plan as insulting to voters, who will see little or no benefit this year or next, and unrealistic in any case because almost every provision will have to be passed again by future legislators under future governors. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who has indicated he will sign the tax-cut bill, is not seeking re-election, and the 187 seats in the General Assembly are all up for election in November as well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Review/Cabaret; Morgana King Still Offers Sensuality and Honey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/arts/review-cabaret-morgana-king-still-offers-sensuality-and-honey.html","abstract":"  Three decades after Morgana King made a splash with her feverishly intense version of \"A Taste of Honey,\" the singer, who will be 64 next week, still conveys the aura of a woman in the throes of a sensual obsession. Her style, so calculated as to risk seeming mannered, consists of pinching her voice into an ethereal hum and spinning out improvisations that suggest prolonged, half-stifled cries of passion.    In Tuesday's opening-night show of her two-week engagement at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street, Chelsea), Ms. King sang a version of \"A Taste of Honey\" that recaptured the tumultuous dreaminess of her original recorded version. Two other songs from \"With a Taste of Honey,\" her landmark 1964 album -- \"Corcovado\" and \"Lazy Afternoon\" -- were among the high points of a set dominated by ballads. Among the more recent songs to receive the grand coloratura treatment were \"A Song for You\" and \"Everything Must Change.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Fighting in Rwanda Capital Blocks Distribution of Food","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/world/fighting-in-rwanda-capital-blocks-distribution-of-food.html","abstract":"  More than a week of heavy fighting in Kigali has made it impossible to distribute food to tens of thousands of people stranded in the Rwandan capital, relief officials say.

No Follow-Up    In one such case, the auditors found that city child welfare officials became suspicious that a foster mother was using drugs in December 1990, but failed to report those concerns for six months.

The Pretenders have just released \"Last of the Independents\" (Sire), their first album since 1990 and their best album in a decade. On Tuesday night at Irving Plaza, they made Ms. Hynde's latest songs sound as good as her old ones.    It didn't hurt that Martin Chambers, the Pretenders' original drummer, has returned to the band, once again splashing water, hurling sticks into the air (one fell back down on his head) and giving the music a laconic yet adamantine foundation. The other three band members -- Adam Seymour on guitar, Andy Hobson on bass and Zeb Jameson on keyboards -- are new, but they determinedly recreate the recorded versions of the songs; in \"Precious,\" Mr. Seymour even copied James Honeyman-Scott's original guitar solo.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"1894:A Great Battle : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/IHT-1894a-great-battle-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"Despatches received from Port Said give particulars of a great battle having been fought on Lake Nyassa between British troops and the slave-raiding chief Makanjira.

She posed some interesting challenges for herself in songs by Poulenc, Griffes and Richard Strauss that rely, to varying degrees, on currents of delicacy and nostalgia.    Had she merely scaled back her sound, she would have seemed restrained, not persuasive. Instead, she followed her instincts and shaped each song on her own terms. She found the perfect lilt for Poulenc's \"Chemins de l'Amour,\" and in Griffes's \"Three Poems by Fiona McLeod\" she suggested the hazy, impressionistic atmosphere without making any sacrifices in power.

Brahms has his moments of seduction, and indeed, the Hungarian flavors of the familiar A-minor Quartet are inviting. Yet asceticism and lean muscle are the real fabric of all three pieces.   In much the same way, an evening with the Juilliard Quartet is rarely a restful experience. These are intensely thoughtful musicians for whom color is a minor priority and hedonism out of the question. Long legato spans are punctuated, often interrupted, by the Juilliard's surging sense of accent. Music, its four musicians seem to be telling us, is an endless source of information for those with the determination and vitality to look for it.

He ripped off his shirt, he blew kisses to the wildly partisan crowd, he swore at the umpire, he drove his opponent, 11th-seeded Thomas Muster, to distraction, he twice came back from the dead. He did everything but win his second-round match against the most prolific clay-courter on the men's circuit.   On a cloudy afternoon that segued into a cloudy evening over the roller-coaster course of this 3-hour-43-minute dogfight, Muster tamed his flashy challenger, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 2-6, 7-5 with a mixture of stalwart serving and steady ground strokes. Expectations Are Dashed    \"I've had a rough clay-court season, and to have to play a guy like Muster wasn't easy for me mentally,\" said a crestfallen Agassi, who arrived in Paris with a 3-3 record on clay and a set of high expectations that defied it. \"I did improve as the match was going on, and to get through something like that would have been quite beneficial.

It is an impressive triumph, but not an unmitigated one.    The museum is a joint venture of two Manhattan-based organizations, the Dia Center for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation (caretaker of the artist's estate), and Pittsburgh's own Carnegie Museum of Art. Its remarkable, singularly appropriate new home, a handsomely renovated 1911 industrial building redesigned by the New York architect Richard Gluckman, may be the apotheosis of the 25-year-old tradition of the renovated SoHo loft.

Talks should relieve the friction that has focused undue attention on a secondary issue -- the $50 billion bilateral trade imbalance -- that drives these allies apart rather than on Mr. Hata's stalled agenda of political and economic reforms that can pull them together.   Though Japan's overall trade surplus results from its high savings rate, the imbalance with the U.S. is in part because of barriers that shut out U.S. exports and investment. Most economists agree that the harm to the U.S. economy is small. But Japan's practices undermine confidence in trade rules and, most important for Mr. Clinton and Congress, hurt powerful constituents -- like Motorola in the cellular phone market.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"1944:U.S. Patrols Meet : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/opinion/IHT-1944us-patrols-meet-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"WITH ALLIED ARMIES IN ITALY [From our New York edition:] American 5th Army patrols, advancing rapidly through the enemy-evacuated Pontine Marshes, made contact with patrols from the Anzio beachhead early this morning [May 25], climaxing a dramatic two-wee","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940526","headline":"Riley Still Sees A Tough Series","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/26/sports/pro-basketball-riley-still-sees-a-tough-series.html","abstract":"  Both the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers are unbeaten at home during the playoffs.

One of New York's institutions, the Monday-night big band at the Village Vanguard gets its annual one-week show. It's a band with all sorts of arranging; its strength is its colors and its soloists. It's also, mistakenly, taken for granted. Shows today and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is no third show on Sunday. There is a $12 cover and an $8 minimum for all shows. PETER WATROUS Jacky Terrasson    Jacky Terrasson, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. The pianist Jacky Terrasson is a master of dynamics, and his trio, with Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Leon Parker on drums, is tight, concise and empathetic. The band is also dedicated to swinging, and it gets a light but furious forward motion going. Mr. Terrasson isn't afraid of strange chords and unusual juxtapositions; he traffics in surprise. Shows through tomorrow are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.; there is a $15 cover and an $8 minimum. P. W. Little Jimmy Scott    Little Jimmy Scott, the Chestnut Room, Tavern on the Green, Central Park at West 67th Street, (212) 873-3200. Little Jimmy Scott's piercing wail infuses everything he sings with an aura of metaphysical lamentation. The songs are mostly ballad standards that lend themselves to a keening rhythm-and-blues style, suggesting a hybrid of Dinah Washington and Little Anthony. The program focuses on songs from Mr. Scott's forthcoming album, \"Dream\" (Warner Brothers). He is backed by a quartet led by the pianist Ken Ichi Shimazu. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and at 8:30 and 10:30 on Sunday night. There is a music charge of $23.50 tonight and tomorrow and $17.50 on Sunday. S. H. Jazz Album of the Week    Kevin Hays, \"Seventh Sense,\" (Blue Note; CD only, $10.99). For those who love the more experimental albums recorded by Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson and Andrew Hill on the Blue Note label in the 1960's, \"Seventh Sense\" is a jolt of joy. Mr. Hays, a pianist best known for his association with the tenor saxophonist Josh Redman, has assembled an excellent band (including Seamus Blake on saxophones, Steve Nelson on vibes, Doug Wiess on bass and Brian Blade on drums) that wheels its way through his open, moody compositions along with works by -- surprise -- Bobby Hutcherson and Joe Henderson. Although the recording isn't well sequenced -- three slow tunes in the middle make it a bit hard to listen to -- it captures the charge that experimentation had in the mid-1960's, when harmonic and rhythmic exploration merged with a solid grounding of swing. It helps that the rhythm section drives so hard; this is an album built on the relationship between piano and vibes and a roaring bass and drums. P.

His goal seems to be a deeply felt abstraction that signals specific themes -- especially loss and mourning -- not only with its preferences for black, silvery grays and evocations of light, but through fleetingly representational details and motifs: his signatory urns, doves and flowers and, new to this show, first names, written in cursive and then rubbed out. But such devices regularly give Mr. Bleckner's work a too-simple sense of both beauty and meaning; they inject sentimental subject matter without enhancing content, letting themselves, and us, off easy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940527","headline":"Where City Children Can Have a Wild Time","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/arts/where-city-children-can-have-a-wild-time.html","abstract":"  THERE are places in this concrete-cornered, plasticized city where children, urban kids, can meet nature.

As she lay dying neighbors asked me to defend the tumult caused by a dozen television minivans, several large satellite uplink trucks and bright lights playing on the building's Fifth Avenue facade.   The television journalists who had to do the difficult job also felt the loss. They were orderly and respectful. They hoped their lights would not disturb Mrs. Onassis or her family.   Yet it should have been possible to reduce redundant equipment. Pool cameras could have provided adequate coverage at the front of the building. Reporters could have made separate on-camera comments from unilateral camera positions close enough for \"presence,\" but distant enough to reduce the glare.   It's probably fair to say Mrs. Onassis had a love-hate relationship with the press, particularly the still photographers.

European modernism took a gigantic step in visually rethinking the natural world, and the art of Africa found a market in the West.   Now as then, many of African art's most ardent collectors are artists, and this acquisition pattern is the theme for \"Western Artists/African Art\" at the Museum for African Art. A gathering of African objects owned by 28 contemporary artists, the show is certainly a study in personal taste. (And with Martin Puryear, Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden among the owners, it is no surprise that many of the objects have tremendous visual appeal.)

Ramsbottom Takes Lead: Nancy Ramsbottom holed a 7-iron from 124 yards for an eagle to cap an eight-under-par 64 and took the first-round lead in the Corning Classic. Pat Bradley and Amy Benz were tied for second. They each shot 65's on the rain-softened Corning (N.Y.) Country Club layout.

The court said it had no choice in its ruling because of a 1992 decision by the United States Supreme Court striking down a St. Paul statute similar to those enacted by New Jersey in 1981.

Mr. Watkins admitted no wrongdoing, but said he had been \"persuaded\" he could no longer perform his job as director of White House administration and management.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940528","headline":"Nets' Anderson Has Surgery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/28/sports/nets-anderson-has-surgery.html","abstract":"  Kenny Anderson, the Nets' All-Star point guard, who learned last week that he had played much of the season with a broken bone in his left wrist, underwent corrective surgery yesterday and is expected to be fully recovered by the start of training camp in October.

There was a tinge of invincibility in the performances of Pete Sampras, Jim Courier and Sergi Bruguera, the defending champion.
