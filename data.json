The 31-year-old Polish grandmaster scored 7-2 to take the $800 first prize in the 10-player invitational event.   Maurice Ashley, a Brooklyn international master, was awarded the $600 second prize for his 6 1/2-2 1/2 tally. There is also a possibility that he may get credit for a norm toward the grandmaster title: Technically, the norm for this competition required 7 points, but in similar cases over the years the International Chess Federation has validated close misses on the part of players like Ashley, who is currently performing consistently well. Ashley had gained his first norm in October in a Marshall Chess Club tourney. Three norms are required.

U.S.A.   1 1/2         In Round 6, Wojtkiewicz demonstrated logical counterattacking play in the center in winning from the Brooklyn international master Joshua Waitzkin.   The fianchetto with 6 g3 and 7 Bg2 is a quiet, positional method of dealing with the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense: the white KB reinforces the e4 pawn and is intended to squelch a black counterattack in the center with a later . . . d5. By developing with 6 . . . e6, 7 . . . Bd7 and 8 . . . Nc6, thus postponing . . . O-O, Black prevents his king from becoming an early target for attack on the kingside.   The plan in playing 9 Nce2 is to prepare for a Maroczy bind with a follow-up c4. However, after 9 . . . Rc8, a result of 10 c4 Nd4 11 Qd4 b5 12 cb ab would have been to dissolve the fetter and free the black queenside.   Perhaps Waitzkin should have played 18 g5 to elicit 18 . . . Ne8 and thus diminish Black's influence in the center. His kingside might then have become a little loose, but that was a risk he might have taken.   Wojtkiewicz prepared logically for the key counterattack, 19 . . . d5!, which negated whatever merit the white position was supposed to have. On 20 ed Bd5 21 Bd5 Rd5, Black would have been ready to attack the weak, backward c2 pawn. Moreover, 20 g5 could have been rebuffed by 20 . . . Qe5 Bd6 22 Qc3 b4 23 Qe3 Nd5 24 Qe4? Nc3. Waitzkin chose 20 e5, but after 20 . . . Ne4, Wojtkiewicz enjoyed excellent piece play and a powerful initiative.   Waitzkin avoided 21 Ne4 because 21 . . . de 22 Qe3 h6 23 Qe2 Bg5 24 Rcd1 Rd1 25 Rd1 e3! 26 Bc6 Qc6 27 fe (27 c3 Qe4 is also unpleasant for Black) Qc2 28 Rd2 Qb1 29 Kg2 Qa2 would have cost him a pawn.   It is not clear why, after 25 c4, Wojtkiewicz did not charge in with 25 . . . Rd3. Of course, his 25 . . . bc 26 Rc3 Bg5 27 Rc8 Rc8 28 Nf4 Rc2 29 Bd4 (29 Rb1 Re2! 30 Qg3 Bf4 31 Qf4 Bd3 32 Qc1 Qb6 is annihilating) Ra2 was powerful. Waitzkin could not play 30 Qe4 because 30 . . . Qe4 31 Re4 Bc6 would have won a piece.   On 31 . . . Qb4, Waitzkin could have defended by 32 Qc3, although Wojtkiewicz could have gotten a winning end game with 32 . . . Qc3 33 Bc3 Ra3 34 Rb1 Bd3 35 Bb4 Ra2 36 Re1 Rb2.   After 33 h4, Wojtkiewicz scored the decisive breakthrough with 33 . . . e3! After 34 fe Bc6! 35 e4 Bd2 36 Re2 Bc3 37 Ra2 Bd4!, Waitzkin either had to lose his rook by 38 Kh2 Qa2 or his queen, by 38 Rf2 Qg3, so he gave up.

Wade of euthanasia. Striking down a 140-year-old Washington State law, Federal District Court Judge Barbara Rothstein declared that as long as they are competent, terminally ill patients have a constitutional right to enlist a willing doctor's help in killing themselves. She decided, that is, that laws against assisted suicide, which exist in almost every state, are unconstitutional. Once again, the courts are at the center of a bitter moral and religious controversy.\n\nAmericans have been arguing about euthanasia for decades. Voters in two states, Washington and California, have rejected measures legalizing euthanasia in fairly close votes; another such measure is expected to be on the ballot in Oregon later this year. In Michigan, a special statute was passed to stop Dr. Jack Kevorkian from helping patients to die, but this month a jury refused to convict him of violating that statute even though he virtually admitted he had.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940517","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/sports/transactions-118303.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League  MILWAUKEE BREWERS -- Sent Mark Kiefer, pitcher, to New Orleans of the American Association.

The hike of one-half of one percentage point was twice as high as many economists believe is warranted. Yet in an uncertain economic environment, the Fed's decision is a defensible move to ward off future bouts of inflation and bring order to volatile currency and financial markets.   Some will criticize the Fed's move as an unnecessary blow to economic growth. Others will say it should have raised rates even higher. The squabbling reflects disagreement about the best way for the Fed to set monetary policy in order to achieve steady growth without igniting inflation.

She began to read. \"It's hard to believe such a thing could be true/And I hope such a thing never happens to you,\" it said. \"But it happened, they say, to poor Mayzie McGrew.\"   Narrated by the Cat in the Hat, the star of his own previous book, the new story, \"Daisie-Head Mayzie,\" tells of a girl who unexpectedly finds a daisy sprouting from the top of her head.

On Sunday she called her music \"folk songs\" and recited some unaccompanied poems, but she's no 1960's throwback. With a ring through one nostril and close-cropped hair topped by a few skinny blond braids, she looks like a rocker. She performs with a drummer, Andy Stochansky, who doubles the drive of her percussive guitar-playing, turning folky melodies into folk-rock.

The effort, if successful, could result in Americans who are thinner, more active and less saturated with salt and alcohol, as well as being less susceptible to heart attacks, strokes, congestive heart failure, circulatory disorders and kidney disease.   The problem is daunting. Thirty million to 50 million adults in the nation have high blood pressure, and each year another two million join their ranks. This makes high blood pressure, or hypertension, the most common risk factor for diseases of the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. Pressure Uncontrolled    Because high blood pressure is so common, lacks warning signs and seems so innocuous for so many years, many people are far too casual about it. They typically fail on one or more of three counts: having their blood pressure checked regularly, adopting living habits that could lower it and, once hypertension is diagnosed, taking the medication that can control it.

But it is also a choice with public consequences. Just how extraordinary those consequences are is evident in a report issued this week by Joseph A. Califano Jr., head of Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse.   Out of $87 billion spent by Medicare for inpatient hospital care this year, at least $20 billion is due to substance abuse. Drug abuse accounts for 3 percent; alcohol abuse, 17 percent; and smoking a whopping 80 percent. Those put in the hospital by cigarettes are, for the most part, suffering from lung cancer, coronary artery disease and chronic pulmonary obstruction disease.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940518","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/18/nyregion/inside-123730.html","abstract":"  Prom Rekindles Bias Case   The Government asked an Alabama judge to reopen a 1970 desegregation case after a principal discouraged interracial prom couples.

Edward Joseph Collins was, for example, somewhat of a Midwestern darling during the first half of this century.

The listener is indebted for the information, for Collins's name is absent from the most prominent reference books now in circulation.   One of these Chicago performances was of the \"Tragic Overture,\" a well-made bit of melodrama offered by the American Composers Orchestra under Dennis Russell Davies on Sunday. This tidy piece fights off every modernistic impulse while clutching Liszt and Wagner firmly to its breast. Yet the \"Tragic Overture\" celebrates more modern calamity than Romantic tragedy. Its dire mood wells up from the bottom of the orchestra: tubas, trombones, double basses. There are moaning half steps, nasty little snare drum figures and, at the end, a funeral march set against solemn drums.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940519","headline":"With Israel Gone, Jericho Takes First Slow Steps to Self-Rule","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/19/world/with-israel-gone-jericho-takes-first-slow-steps-to-self-rule.html","abstract":"  The Jericho post office was open today, but since it lacked Palestinian stamps, no one could send any letters.
