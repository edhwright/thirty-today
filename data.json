It was Brien Taylor pitching against Jim Abbott, the Yankee future against the Yankee present. So what if it was only an intrasquad game.   Although it would be foolish to dismiss Abbott's drawing power, most of the 3,500 spectators came to watch the 21-year-old Taylor oppose major league hitters for the first time. Taylor pitched for the Class A affiliate in Fort Lauderdale last year, and the former No. 1 draft choice did not disappoint the locals who returned as he uncorked his still-developing fastball and displayed a cool demeanor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Starks Becomes Show-Stopping Phantom of the Garden","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/sports/basketball-starks-becomes-show-stopping-phantom-of-the-garden.html","abstract":"  A masked man sparked the Knicks to a 28-point lead last night, then a sometimes forgotten man protected it.

Seattle is bound to lose its magnetic pull eventually, and people will once again consider it simply the home of airplanes and rain. Then it will be Portland's moment to dazzle the masses. Cheaper rents and less hype, but proximity to the alternative-rock boomtown, make the City of Roses an ideal cultivating ground for challenging, smart new rock. One of Portland's best offerings so far is Pond. The group, which has released a debut album on Nirvana's former label, Sub/Pop, has a sound all its own, based in melodic mutterings and angry psychedelic zoom. Pond appears Saturday night in the middle of a bill warmed up by Coffee and headlined by Buffalo Tom. The late show is sold out, so get your tickets now for the 7:30 P.M. performance. Tickets are $8, available at See Hear in Manhattan, (212) 505-9781; Pier Platters in Hoboken, (201) 795-9015, or through Ticketmaster. Female Power     Kristin Hersh, She Never Blinks and Cindy Lee Berryhill, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. The power of woman is unleashed in two separate shows on Saturday at this favorite downtown spot. Kristin Hersh, leader of the trailblazing avant-rock group Throwing Muses, sings and plays her harrowing, gorgeous music in a solo performance; She Never Blinks opens. That show begins at 9 P.M. Taking the stage at 11 is Cindy Lee Berryhill, reclaiming her title as the Dorothy Parker of folk with a set of her dry-as-ice, bittersweet compositions. Each show is $10 and tickets are available at the Knitting Factory or through Ticketmaster. Sweet, Sharp and Blue     Son Seals, Tramp's, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. Son Seals plays blues that can be as bitter as the Chicago wind, but when they're sweet they're like creme brulee, dark and sharp on the surface, but with an inside that's rich with sugar. Mr. Seals remains among the best guitarists to carry the torch from such players as Muddy Waters, paying attention to rock without abandoning the basic 12-bar tradition. His music communicates the harsh realities of black urban life in terms that make as much sense today as they did when the blues were young. This show's a real bargain, especially since Lucky Peterson is opening on Friday and the Bennett Brothers share the bill on Saturday. Sets begin at 8:30 and 11:30 each night, and tickets are available at Tramp's or through Ticketmaster.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Trade's New Sheriff","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/trade-s-new-sheriff.html","abstract":"  Both Clintons were on view last week.

(Who could forget \"The Great Age of Japanese Buddhist Sculpture\" in 1982?) But its recent track record has been somewhat spotty. It reached a low point a few years ago with an exhibition of Ansel Adams photographs from a Japanese private collection, an unfathomable choice for a New York audience with exceedingly long exposure to this photographer's work.   By contrast, \"Visions of the Dharma: Japanese Buddhist Paintings and Prints in the Honolulu Academy of Arts\" brings the society back up to speed. The work is extremely beautiful and is unfamiliar locally; much of it is being published for the first time in the good-looking catalogue written by the Honolulu Academy's curator of Asian art, Stephen Little, that accompanies the show. The catalogue's contention that the academy has one of the \"finest groupings of Japanese Buddhist paintings and prints in the United States\" may be a bit inflated; with collections in Boston, Cleveland, San Francisco and Washington on the list, the competition is fairly stiff.

Steinbrenner's routine shamelessness was diminished and he merely materialized at spring training rather than stage an elaborate entrance with choppers, limos and celebrity look-alikes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/IHT-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago-93948759790.html","abstract":"1918: An Ignoble Peace","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Sounds Around Town","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/arts/sounds-around-town-628593.html","abstract":"  Trio Plus One    Daryl Scherman Quartet, Tavern on the Green, Central Park West at 67th Street, (212) 873-3200. For several years the pianist and singer Daryl Scherman has been developing an enviable polish as a performer with a repertory of rarely heard songs, chosen perceptively from the pop output of the last 70 years. She has done this in solo situations, in a duo with the bassist Boots Maleson and in a trio with the guitarist James Chirillo. This weekend her group has become a quartet with the addition of the saxophonist Morris Goldberg, a white native of South Africa who came to the United States 30 years ago and has spent much of his career here playing with black South Africans like Hugh Masakela and Abdullah Ibrahim as well as with American musicians. The result is an unusual mixture of sources and styles. The group plays tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30, and on Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. There is a music charge of $15 tonight and tomorrow, but no minimum at any show. In Great Footsteps     Ruth Brown, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. As great singers like Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington have passed from the music scene, one of the singers following most capably in their tradition is Ruth Brown. She might have been just a rhythm-and-blues belter, which was the way she started out in the 1950's, but she added to this the jazz inspiration she received from Holiday, Vaughan and Washington. In fact, her program at Fat Tuesday's includes many jazz standards, which she will record for an album when her engagement ends. Backed by a group led by the guitarist Rodney Jones, she will sing tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $27.50 music charge and a $10 minimum. Cabaret and Jazz     Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, J's, 2581 Broadway, north of 97th Street, (212) 666-3600. A year ago, when the Manhattan Association of Caberets and Clubs had firmly established March as Cabaret Month, J's brought another flavor to the celebration with friendly programs called \"Cabaret Meets Jazz.\" The two elements are joining forces again on Sundays this year, starting this weekend when a pair of rising cabaret singers, Wendy Caplan and Billy Porter, share the evening and the backing of a jazz trio led by the pianist Billy Charlap with Sean Smith on bass and Tim Horner at the drums. Miss Caplan came to attention Off Broadway in \"Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding\" and Mr. Porter was the 1992 \"Star Search\" winner. Miss Caplan goes on at 8:30 P.M. and Mr. Porter at 10; at 11:30 Mr. Charlap's trio has the stage to itself. There is a $12 minimum at the tables and a $7 minimum at the bar.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Philippines:A Long Road, but Ramos Is Under Way","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/opinion/IHT-philippinesa-long-road-but-ramos-is-under-way.html","abstract":"- Things are looking up in the Philippines, although there is still a long way to go.

We have been spoiled by the great success of our 12 notes and we tend to take them for granted. On the piano keyboard the artifice is still greater. We have sliced up the octave into 12 equal parts, leaving every note just a little out of tune.    One of the tasks taken on by the pianist Phillip Bush in Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday night was to remind us that the piano's tuning is only a recent development, that other systems of tuning are available to make other expressions possible. He had three Yamaha grands, a Steinway grand and a Yamaha SY77 Synthesizer with a computer on stage with him, each offering a slightly different historical model of what our scale might sound like. The influence of the composer Harry Partch, who had an interest in microtones and tuning, could be heard throughout the newer works.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Candidates for Congress Spent Record $678 Million, a 52% Jump","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/us/candidates-for-congress-spent-record-678-million-a-52-jump.html","abstract":"  Candidates for the House and Senate spent more than two-thirds of a billion dollars on their 1992 election campaigns, 52 percent more than was spent on the 1990 legislative races, the Federal Election Commission said today.

Wojciech Jaruzelski is twice guaranteed a large place in Polish history. In December 1981 he was the tough-minded Communist boss who imposed martial law to crush Solidarity, the grass-roots labor movement. His military and secret police forces hunted down thousands of activists and herded them off to detention camps. He came to symbolize, personally, the reimposition at gunpoint of a hated, Soviet-sponsored dictatorship on a resentful Polish nation.   Yet less than eight years later, in early 1989, it was the same General Jaruzelski who authorized Solidarity's return to legal status, and eventually its accession to government power. Poland soon became the first non-Communist state in Eastern Europe since World War II, and General Jaruzelski felt comfortable enough with the new regime to stay on as President for another year and more.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"Foot Infections Puts Jordan in the Hospital","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/05/sports/sports-people-basketball-foot-infections-puts-jordan-in-the-hospital.html","abstract":"  MICHAEL JORDAN was hospitalized yesterday in Chicago because of a foot infection.

This time around city officials appear to be taking a more conciliatory approach. They are reaching out more to the businesses, known as sex clubs, and seeking their cooperation in monitoring themselves rather than forcing further closings.

Emphasis on Monitoring    The resurgence of commercial sex establishments, catering to both homosexuals and heterosexuals, in New York and other cities is at odds with signs that many people are growing more conservative in their sexual practices because they fear AIDS. Public health officials in New York City say several factors may be at play -- denial of the H.I.V. risk, a sense of immortality among younger generations, sexual preferences that are difficult to modify, and even a sense of fatalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930305","headline":"How Do You Fight the Mob?

He crawls to the rear of the car, removes the hose from the exhaust and sneaks back to the bushes. After a few minutes, the man climbs out again, weeping and mumbling and holding a bottle of whisky, reattaches the hose and climbs back into the car. Ricky begins to cry and to plead with his brother to take him home, but Mark pulls the hose loose again. This bizarre ritual continues until the man catches Mark and drags him into the car to die beside him.   Inside, the man threatens Mark with a gun and drunkenly explains why he's committing suicide. He's a lawyer who does work for the mob, and one of his clients, Barry (the Blade) Muldanno, has murdered a United States Senator. Nobody can find the body to use as evidence, but the suicidal lawyer has just learned that Barry hid it under the floor of the lawyer's garage. Besides Barry the Blade, he's the only one who knows, so his life is worthless.   While the lawyer is telling Mark all this and getting steadily drunker, Ricky removes the hose. Mark then escapes from the car and hides in the bushes again. The lawyer climbs out of the car once more, sees the detached hose and shoots himself in the head. The boys run home. Ricky goes into traumatic shock and has to be hospitalized. Both the police and Barry the Blade begin to suspect what the lawyer told Mark just before he died. They begin to press the boy to tell.   But what is most astonishing about this opening, which takes all of 20 pages, is how little Mr. Grisham does with it in the next 400 pages. \"The Client\" brings new force to the word anticlimax. It is as if at the outset the narrator had announced that he was about to conduct us on a journey across a desert with a cactus and a rock in it to a mountain range beyond, and that several surprises were in store. The surprises turn out to be that the cactus is a cactus, the rock is a rock and the mountain range is a mountain range. Once again, as he did in \"The Firm,\" Mr. Grisham enraptures us with a story that has hardly any point.   What's most irritating is how deeply the plot hooks us. Mark Sway is \"a tough little kid, raised on the streets and wise beyond his years,\" as another character gratuitously informs us. Instead of letting himself be pushed around, Mark goes out and hires himself a lawyer, a woman who calls herself Reggie Love, and he tells her what he's feeling: \"I'm really sick of this. Just sick of it. All my buddies are in school today, having a good time, being normal, fighting with girls during recess, playing jokes on the teachers, you know, the usual stuff. And look at me. Running around town with my lawyer, reading about my adventures in the newspapers, looking at my face on the front page, hiding from reporters, dodging killers with switch-blades.

Tethering was, in a sense, the raison d'etre of Mr. Feld's new \"Frets and Women.\" The ballet, set to music by Lou Harrison that tended to be repetitive and self-limiting, is a ritualistic dance for a group of nine women, with solos for three of them. The women are dressed in gray sheaths that cover their body from shoulders to toe, but leave one leg bare.

At a glance, his idiosyncratic blending of Tanzanian folk song, American blues and jazz and European art music may seem trendy or calculated, but one must admit that he comes by it honestly: He was born in London in 1957, and after studying classical music as a child, he joined the music-theater troupe directed by his stepfather, Roy Hart.

This production has managed to grasp not only Janacek's two-tiered conception, but also the complexities of his context.

Great works hang in the typing pool, in professors' offices and along a sweep of hallways. The intent is that art be digested and enjoyed daily, like a textbook or a lecture. Contemplating a Warhol should be as natural as stopping at the fountain for a drink of water. \nVaults and Back Rooms\n\n \"At most museums the majority of the work is hidden away in vaults and back rooms for years, for centuries even,\" Dr. Kintzler said. \"We put the collection right out for students, faculty and staff to see everyday and I think that's one of the reasons so many artists and dealers have donated to us.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"In the Region: New Jersey; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/realestate/in-the-region-new-jersey-recent-sales-054793.html","abstract":"  Alexandria  $318,488   13 Shy Creek Road  4-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath, new colonial; hardwood floors, whirlpool, fireplace; taxes not yet available.

The gangster rappers take the money and the opprobrium, while the bohemians get the critical raves but can't sell records.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Miss Cutler, Mr. de Vicq de Cumptich Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/style/weddings-miss-cutler-mr-de-vicq-de-cumptich-jr.html","abstract":"  Fearn Cutler, the daughter of Mrs. Ralph H.

Lindbergh, whom she met two years after his historic 1927 flight. The Lindberghs' 45-year marriage forms the centerpiece of this thoroughgoing portrait by Dorothy Herrmann, whose previous biography was of S. J. Perelman. Although Harold Nicolson described Mrs. Lindbergh with blithe condescension as \"an adorable little person,\" she proved equal to the dangerous, even death-defying pioneer flights she later wrote about, on which she accompanied her famous husband, serving as co-pilot, radio operator and all-round good sport. In 1932, she endured the kidnapping and murder of their firstborn son and the relentless press coverage the event produced. Later she weathered the fall from public grace that the couple experienced over Lindbergh's rigidly isolationist and pro-Nazi views, aspects of which she shared. While Ms. Herrmann seems intent on rescuing Mrs. Lindbergh's lyrical if occasionally cloying writings (13 books of nonfiction, poetry, fiction and memoir in addition to her 1955 best seller \"Gift From the Sea\"), her subject ultimately trips up the biographer. Because Mrs. Lindbergh placed duty to her husband before devotion to her craft, Ms. Herrmann suggests, her longevity as a writer was compromised. \"In a sense,\" she writes, Lindbergh \"and their extraordinary life together were her only subject.\" If that is so, then perhaps it is no coincidence that Mrs. Lindbergh, now 86 years old, has published virtually nothing since 1974, the year her husband died.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"President Asserts His Opponents 'Lack the Vision' on the Economy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/us/president-asserts-his-opponents-lack-the-vision-on-the-economy.html","abstract":"  President Clinton, seeking to counter accusations that his Administration is more interested in spending money than in cutting the deficit, said today that his critics \"lack the vision\" to improve the economy.

It seemed, as one expert put it, that the United States enjoyed a kind of \"immunity\" from the terrorism that afflicted France, Germany and Lebanon. Maybe it was because there were plenty of American targets abroad for terrorists to attack. Maybe it was because, whether deserved or not, the United States had a reputation for good law enforcement and for a willingness to retaliate for terrorist attacks, as it did with a bombing raid against Libya in 1987.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Jeanette Pincus, Adam L.

When Jarmila Novotna, the Metropolitan Opera's lyric soprano star of the World War II era, answers the telephone or welcomes a visitor to her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan, the syllables of \"Hel-lo\" are musical pitches. When she tells an exciting or agitating story from the days of her singing career, which began in Prague in 1925 and ended 31 years later at the Met, she punctuates her sentences and paragraphs with a \"la-la-la\" that rings like silver bells.   \"My friends laugh at me,\" she said during a recent visit. \"Oh, Jarmila, you never stop singing.\" And then comes a little snatch of vocalise, pure and high, and one wonders whether Miss Novotna ought not to be coaxed into recording a few of her old songs, even at 85. Maybe a few more of the tuneful folk songs of her native Czechoslovakia. In the 1920's and 30's, Miss Novotna was close to the family of President Thomas G. Masaryk. His son Jan, later the Czechoslovak Ambassador to London, played folk songs with great fluency and inventiveness on the piano, and Miss Novotna often sang with him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Piquant Dishes, Turquoise and Pink Decor","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/dining-out-piquant-dishes-turquoise-and-pink-decor.html","abstract":"  What once seemed a marathon of new Thai restaurants has slowed to a walk.

A man of my age, bearing an uncanny resemblance to me and calling himself Philip Roth, turned up in Jerusalem shortly before I did and set about proselytizing for \"Diasporism,\" a political program he'd devised advocating that the Jews of Israel return to their European countries of origin in order to avert \"a second Holocaust,\" this one at the hands of the Arabs. Inasmuch as his imposturing constituted a crisis I was living rather than writing, it embodied a form of self-denunciation that I could not sanction, a satirizing of me so bizarre and unrealistic as to exceed by far the boundaries of amusing mischief I may myself have playfully perpetrated on my own existence in fiction.\n\nNow, in life as in art, mischief can be a relief from all the prescriptions. The more scrupulously exacting the prescriptions, the greater the relief afforded by the mischief. Perhaps because of the abundance of prescriptions both internally and externally generated by Jewish history, perhaps because of the singular sort of care that living as a Jew has generally required, perhaps because of the exaggerated seriousness with which a thoughtful Jew is often burdened, Jewish mischief -- as couched, say, in the inexhaustible jokes about their peculiarities that Jews themselves so much enjoy -- flourishes, surprisingly enough, in even the most superdignified Jewish circles. The mischief subverts all the strategies that the Jewish predicament imposes, affords immeasurable if transitory relief not only because it is counterprohibitive but because it is counterparanoid as well, indifferent to threat, to enemies, to all the defenses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"THE TWIN TOWERS: The Bomb; Stored Chemicals Were Blast Waiting to Happen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/the-twin-towers-the-bomb-stored-chemicals-were-blast-waiting-to-happen.html","abstract":"  Investigators working on the bombing of the World Trade Center said yesterday that some of the chemicals found at a self-storage locker in Jersey City had been combined in a highly volatile mixture that could have exploded with great force at any time.   \"All you needed for a big explosion was a drastic change in temperature or for someone to knock over one of the containers,\" said one explosives expert who has been monitoring the investigation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"NO MORE NICE GIRLS\nCountercultural Essays.\nBy Ellen Willis.\nWesleyan University/University Press of New England, $22.95.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Honoring New York Citizens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/style/evening-hours-honoring-new-york-citizens.html","abstract":"  The Municipal Art Society's salute, Feb. 28.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Knee Sidelines Bream","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/sports/sports-people-baseball-knee-sidelines-bream.html","abstract":"  First baseman SID BREAM of the Braves underwent surgery late Friday night in Atlanta to remove a bone chip from his right knee and he might not be ready to play when the major league season opens in Chicago on April 5.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Holding On and Letting Go","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/books/holding-on-and-letting-go.html","abstract":"  ANNA   A Daughter's Life.

Danto raises the issue of consent. Unlike Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand or Diane Arbus, who all caught their subjects off guard, unaware or simply not knowing how they would look, Mapplethorpe got his subjects' full trust because he was part of their world. The thrill of these photographs, writes Mr. Danto, the art critic for The Nation, is that of \"the child who finds it delicious to be thrown in the air, certain his father will not let him fall.\" Thus, rather than catching the suspicious glare and passionate flurry of hostile strangers, Mapplethorpe caught the calm, clear look of those who want to be seen, say, urinating into the mouth of a friend, or up to their elbows in someone else's anus. Whether he was photographing the artist Alice Neel's ragged face when she was near death, or his roommate, the singer Patti Smith, nude and clutching some radiator pipes like a mental patient, or Mr. 10 1/2 exhibiting his organ on a table like a slab of meat, the staginess, the stillness, the symmetry all indicate Mapplethorpe's subjects were not just about to walk out of his viewfinder or his world. But what did he get from the luxury of consent? In a word, domestication. Even the most shocking photographs are tamed by the permission implicit in them. The picture of Elliott grabbing the testicles of Dominick, who is chained upside down, is so planned that it looks, as Mr. Danto says, like \"a fisherman being photographed next to some immense tuna he has caught.\" And one of the best shots, \"Man in a Polyester Suit,\" featuring a smooth, uncircumcised penis lolling out of a man's fly, is funny because it is so offhand. Mapplethorpe got so much permission for so many things that he made us forget, at least occasionally, what he was getting away with.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"For Gay People, a Time of Triumph and Fear","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/for-gay-people-a-time-of-triumph-and-fear.html","abstract":"  After enduring weeks of vitriol in battles over homosexuals in the military, the St. Patrick's Day parade and school curriculums, gay and lesbian New Yorkers are taking stock -- many hurt and angry, others scared but defiant.   \"It's terrifying that outright bigotry against us is acceptable public discourse,\" said Howard Cruise, 48, a cartoonist who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens. \"People wouldn't dare talk about any other group, blacks or whatever, the way they talk about us.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"A U.S. Hotel List Notes Fire Safety","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/travel/practical-traveler-a-us-hotel-list-notes-fire-safety.html","abstract":"  FIRE safety for travelers moved ahead as this year opened. The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 began to have an impact on the marketplace with a drastic revision of the Federal Travel Directory. This makes it the first guide to American lodging that lists only places that have a smoke detector in every room, wired into the hotel's electric system, and, in the case of buildings taller than three stories, have installed a sprinkler system. Battery-operated smoke detectors are unacceptable because batteries wear out and can be stolen.    The Federal Travel Directory has been published for years, but now the safety act dictates that it may list no American hotel or motel unless it conforms to the law's provisions. To accomplish this, the Government gathered a list of conforming properties from the states and territories and then purged from the Federal Travel Directory all the places not on this master list, shrinking the directory from 9,000 listings in December to 4,164 in January. Federal Travel Directory    The Federal Travel Directory is not a likely rival for the Mobil Guide or the A.A.A. Tour Book, because the type is pretty small and there are no pictures. You have probably never seen it unless you are a Government employee, but it is revised and published anew each month, and anyone can buy a copy for $13. The initial issues for 1993 by no means include all the places that have taken the fire-safety steps; some have not gotten their reports into the system, although Government officials expect the data gathering, which is being accomplished through state fire marshals, to catch up soon. In any case, unless a hotel offers a \"government rate,\" meaning a discount, it is not included. Some foreign hotels offering discounts for Government travelers are included, but they are not subject to the law.

Chiles formed the task force, which is made up of tourism and law-enforcement officials, after the Canadian Automobile Association and Canadian Government officials warned of dangers in Florida following the recent fatal shooting near Miami of an Ontario tourist during an attempted robbery. Other well-publicized crimes include the New Year's Day burning in Tampa of a black New York tourist, characterized by police as a race-related incident, and an attack in February on an Argentine man during a carjacking in St. Petersburg.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930307","headline":"Mary Lawson-Johnston, N.
