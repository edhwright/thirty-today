We take pride in being citizens of a self-invented, self-reforming, enduring constitutional democracy. We think of the United States as having glorious -- if tarnished -- national traditions.   Many of the exceptions to this rule are found in colleges and universities, in the academic departments that have become sanctuaries for left-wing political views. I am glad there are such sanctuaries, even though I wish we had a left more broadly based, less self-involved and less jargon-ridden than our present one. But any left is better than none, and this one is doing a great deal of good for people who have gotten a raw deal in our society: women, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians. This focus on marginalized groups will, in the long run, help to make our country much more decent, more tolerant and more civilized.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"It's Truly a Fresh Start for Yankees","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/sports/baseball-it-s-truly-a-fresh-start-for-yankees.html","abstract":"  Spring training is almost here, meet the new Yankees.

And so these intrepid film makers began to shatter the granite face of the documentary. Critics called their work direct cinema; in France, they called it cinema verite.   Albert Maysles, now 67, was one of those pioneers; his latest documentary, \"Umbrellas\" (made with Henry Corra and Grahame Weinbren and featuring Christo's umbrella project as it unfolded in Japan and California in 1991), has been selected to have its premiere on Friday at the Berlin International Film Festival.

Those stone skeletons -- surrounded by the houses of a modern town that has grown up around them, or standing solitary in a green field with sheep grazing nearby or visible atop a distant hill -- conjure up legends of knights and ladies, saints and outlaws.\n\nThe Anglo-Norman city of Kilkenny, situated on a bend of the River Nore 73 miles southwest of Dublin, is probably the best place in Ireland to get a feeling for life on this island in the Middle Ages. Though no bigger than a large town, Kilkenny, (population 19,000) which dates from the seventh century, has been an important trading and administrative center since at least the 13th century, and was at one time the capital of Ireland. The city retains its medieval street plan, with narrow, winding lanes that rise suddenly and dip sharply. Its streets are lined with substantial Georgian buildings, as well as even older houses that date back to the middle ages -- their chimneys rising from their gable ends, filling the air with the characteristically Irish aroma of turf smoke. In addition to containing several important old buildings, ecclesiastical and secular, Kilkenny provides a base for excursions into the surrounding countryside. Kilkenny is a city for walking. The narrow streets are not easily negotiated by car. On foot you notice more, and you are in a position to appreciate the city's atmosphere and scale.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"School Break Activities for Youngsters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/school-break-activities-for-youngsters.html","abstract":"The school vacation week for Westchester's children begins on Feb. 21.

Newhouse Theater, as having been \"suggested\" by the Arthur Schnitzler classic, \"La Ronde\" (titled \"Reigen\" in German). The young American composer, lyricist and librettist has effectively deconstructed the melancholy and skeptical Viennese sex comedy without putting it back together. The new work is not an adaptation of the Schnitzler play, but it is an impertinent, sometimes haunting, often jokey commentary on it.   \"Hello Again,\" directed and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, is still about the daisy chain of sexual encounters that begins when a whore has al fresco sex with a soldier, who then makes love to a young woman, who moves on to a different young man, until, at last, the ninth and final partner returns to the whore. The Schnitzler play, which is about romantic dreams repeatedly dashed, is contained within the small, hermetically sealed world of turn-of-the-century Vienna. Mr. LaChiusa liberates the Schnitzler characters but at a certain cost to coherence. They now move freely back and forth in time, through the first nine explosive decades of the 20th century.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"F.Y.I.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/fyi-155438.html","abstract":"  Limits of the Law Q.

Part of Ms. Carey's significance -- and undoubtedly the sharpest controversy around her -- has nothing to do with the singer's musical gifts. Instead it derives from the confusion and discomfort that her multiracial identity provokes in an American culture obsessed with race. Though she has made no secret that she is biracial (her mother is Irish-American, her father is a black Venezuelan), Ms. Carey's candor evokes clashing responses from fans and critics. Some see her statement of mixed heritage as a refusal to bow to public pressure to choose whether she is black or white. But in light of the \"one drop\" rule -- where a person is considered black by virtue of having one drop of black blood, a holdover from America's racist past -- many conclude that the issue of racial identity, for Ms. Carey and other interracial people, is settled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Amy Sue Weber, Marc A.

When photography first came along, it was too slow for most events and had to settle for the sites. In 1855, during the Crimean war, the English photographer Roger Fenton took a picture of the Valley of the Shadow of Death after the killing was over and nothing remained but spent cannonballs. During the American Civil War, photographers unable to stop the action recorded bridges, ruins, \"The Scene of General MacPherson's Death\" after the general's body was removed. When faster lenses and films were devised, the event itself became primary again, but since photographers are not always in the right place at the right time, the site and its aftermath have been subjects often enough.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Two for the Roads: A Vision of Urban Design","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/arts/architecture-view-two-for-the-roads-a-vision-of-urban-design.html","abstract":"  WE'RE RIGHT TO BE SKEPTICAL OF URBAN visionaries.

A self-taught black painter working in Norwich, Conn., Ruley died violently in 1959, at the age of 77, under suspicious circumstances. Or, as Glenn Robert Smith argues (with the help of Robert Kenner), convincingly if luridly, he was murdered in a racially motivated attack. Married to a white woman and the imperious patriarch of a racially mixed extended family, Ruley took up painting in his later years. His surviving production, presented here in rich color illustrations, comprises small, highly simplified works on board, including pastoral and hunting scenes, landscapes and motifs reworked from photographs in popular magazines. An essay by Stacy Hollander, a curator, and Lee Kogan, a senior research fellow, at the Museum of American Folk Art, traces Ruley's likely sources, primarily stock images of popular heroes and bathing beauties that the artist appropriated to construct a kind of private idyll, a fantasy imagery of male desire with some affinity, as the authors note, to the work of Rousseau. The monographic approach by Mr. Smith, a California collector of folk art, and Mr. Kenner, the former editor of Art & Antiques -- a melodramatic account of Ruley's life and a search for sources and influences -- seems intended primarily to establish a market for Ruley's paintings. The book does not address a range of issues currently being raised in relation to the work of self-taught artists, like the ways race, class and difference shape their work. The book does, however, present interesting new material to be explored in those discussions.\nMIGNON NIXON","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"Angel Falls","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/travel/l-angel-falls-166740.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Your readers might like to know that it was a news photographer in search of a story who led the first overland expedition to Angel Falls, in May 1949.

I cannot just at this moment think of any reservations to express about the other two leads in this almost literally unbelievable cast. Oralia Dominguez is Preziosilla and Renato Capecchi is Fra Melitone, so there is strength in every department. In any case, the exercise in judiciousness feels surreal. This is a must-have.

I have noticed seals in their habitats during my tens of thousands of miles sailing on my schooner, the Malabar X, along the coasts of Maine, the Atlantic Seaboard and the Pacific Coast, and I can tell you it is rather common knowledge to most seafaring people that seals are the favorite delicacy of sharks. When any seal migrates, its greatest danger comes from the threat of being eaten by a shark.   Due to the incredible overfishing of shark by sports and commercial fishermen the shark population has dwindled substantially since the 30's to the point where shark fishing is barely being allowed. This decimation of the shark population has made it possible for seals to migrate successfully.  While temperature, salinity and food source may have a bearing, the biggest influence on a successful migration is the lack of the major predator.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"State Acquires Stretch of Popular Trout Stream","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/nyregion/state-acquires-stretch-of-popular-trout-stream.html","abstract":"  New York State has acquired a 14-mile stretch of shoreline on one of the state's premier trout and salmon fishing streams, Oswego County's Salmon River, which flows into Lake Ontario.

WHY: The traditional flat lid -- the one that allows coffee to slosh over the top and onto the drinker's clothing -- may be acceptable for the 50-cent, no-name brew from the corner deli. But not for $2.75 cappuccino or espresso doppio. With their stylish brews, coffees bars have introduced the lids to Manhattan. DOUBLES AS A HAT: The visual effect is startling. The lid looks like a white derby sitting atop the cup. Although there are several variations on the dome lid, all of them let the coffee drinker sip through a small hole in the curved mouthpiece. The lid goes by a variety of names, depending on the manufacturer: Traveler Lid, Sipping Lid, Gourmet Lid. SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE: Manufacturers claim that by raising the roof on the coffee cup, they have advanced the technology of take-out coffee in two ways. First, they talk about \"a splash barrier\" or a \"spill-free drinking environment.\" They say that with an inch of air above the cup, \"coffee doesn't slosh out, doesn't bounce out.\" Second, they say the dome provides space for whipped cream or steamed milk. In other words, they say they have eliminated \"the squish factor.\" WHO MAKES IT: With the growing popularity of both coffee bars and America's takeout life style, competition in the lid business is steaming. Solo Cup Company of Highland Park, Ill., says that it created the genre of the dome lid five years ago and holds a patent on it. Sweetheart Cup Company of Chicago came out with a dome lid a few months ago.   Now, the two are locked in legal combat. Solo has filed a lawsuit, charging patent infringement, against Sweetheart. Molly Powers, Solo's marketing manager, said that no one at Solo could talk about the company's lid, or even provide a sample to be photographed, because of the legal battle. Sweetheart is not reticent. \"The case is frivolous,\" said Daniel M. Carson, the vice president and general counsel of Sweetheart.   Steve Smith, the product manager for hot beverages at Sweetheart, is already claiming a victory. \"Our rate of delivery is better,\" he said. \"When you tip the lid to drink, you don't get too much and you don't get too little.\"   The main difference between the lids lies in the mouthpiece: indented on Solo's, raised on Sweetheart's. COST: Despite the fancy engineering, manufacturers and retailers say the dome lids cost a coffee vendor no more than the flat versions.   Good news, no doubt, for people whose favorite coffee already costs as much as a sandwich.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"FILM CRITICISM\nTHE PHANTOM EMPIRE\nBy Geoffrey O'Brien.\nNorton, $20.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940213","headline":"'One Long Orgiastic Read'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/one-long-orgiastic-read.html","abstract":"  THE LITERARY COMPANION TO SEX An Anthology of Prose and Poetry.

St.-Tropez Day Trips  Q. I will be in St.-Tropez, France, for the last week in March and the first week of April and would like to travel on day trips to places like Vence, Nice and Cap-Ferrat. Are there buses from St.-Tropez to these places? -- Susan Wexford, New York, N.Y. A. Bus service from St.-Tropez is very limited, but there are alternatives that will get you where you want to go.   One bus trip that you might not want to miss leaves from La Foux, three miles west of St.-Tropez, at 7:40 A.M. on Saturday, March 26, and proceeds the length of the Riviera to San Remo, Italy. The trip to San Remo, which the tour organizers describe as the flower capital of the Riviera, takes close to three hours and costs $22 round trip without meals, calculated at 5.8 francs to the dollar.   More information: St.-Tropez Tourist Office, Gare Routiere, St.-Tropez; 94.43.26.98.   Only two towns, Toulon and St.-Raphael, are served by buses from the bus station at St.-Tropez. Toulon is west of St.-Tropez, and therefore not in the direction you wish to go.   St.-Raphael, northeast of St.-Tropez, is 1 hour, 25 minutes away by bus. The first departure from the St.-Tropez bus station (94.97.41.21) is at 6:20 A.M. every day; departures after that are more or less hourly until the last bus at 7:15 P.M. The fare is $15.50 round trip.   The good news about St.-Raphael is that it has a railroad station (94.91.50.50) from which trains leave for Nice at frequent intervals, starting at 7:33 A.M. The journey takes about an hour and costs $19 round trip.    Once in Nice, a city with splendid museums and art galleries, you have a couple of options.    The Santa Azur company offers a variety of sightseeing bus tours in and around Nice. They also offer minibus tours with a bilingual driver and on these the passengers pick where they would like to go, putting such places as Vence, St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and Monte Carlo within easy reach. Prices range from $206 for a half day for one to three people to $310 for a nine-hour day. Prices for four to eight people are $250 for a half day and $336 for a full day.    More information: Santa Azur, 11 Avenue Jean-Medecin, 06000 Nice; 93.85.46.81, fax 93.82.38.78.   To rent a car with a bilingual driver contact Richard Dems at Avis Chauffeur, Agence Cote d'Azur, Place Massena, 2 Avenue des Phoceens, 06300 Nice; 93.62.50.96. Rates start at $168 for four hours and $327 for a full day.  The Budapest Expo  Q. Two years ago I read of plans for a World's Fair in Budapest either in 1995 or 1996. Do you have any updated information about it? -- Harlan D. Everett, Canandaigua, N.Y. A. The original proposal, in the 1980's, called for the 1995 World Expo to be held jointly in Budapest and Vienna. It was to have been the first formal linkage of the two cities since the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918.   In May 1991, however, a referendum was held on the proposal among residents of Vienna and the measure was defeated.   Since then Hungary has decided to go it alone. The Hungarian Parliament voted in December 1991 to hold the event in Budapest in 1996. The exhibition, to be held from May 11 to Oct. 4, will have communications as its main theme.    Some 10 million to 12 million visitors are expected.

Oliver Koppell, who has become State Attorney General, features two undistinguished candidates who both come out of the political morass of Bronx Democratic politics. They have run a dispiriting campaign. Jeffrey Dinowitz, the Democrat, is allied with the so-called reform wing of his party. He is a political ally of Mr. Koppell who works as a traffic court judge and is active in local party politics. The Liberal Party candidate, Mark Friedlander, who comes out of the old Bronx Democratic machine, is commissioner and president of the city's Tax Appeals Tribunal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940214","headline":"E.M.S.

He has prepared position papers, met with a national expert on the topic, and traveled to Washington to share his ideas with Vice President Al Gore.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940214","headline":"Review/Television; Like Card Companies, Networks Love Holidays","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/14/arts/review-television-like-card-companies-networks-love-holidays.html","abstract":"  Always eager to make the most of a marketing opportunity, prime-time television is pouncing on St. Valentine's Day in its own disorganized, almost charmingly daffy way.

While immigration has helped keep New York City's population relatively stable, the recession took its toll on cities like Hartford, Boston and Bridgeport. Suburban counties in the New York region continue to grow and the New York metropolitan area, by far the nation's largest, added about 120,000 people.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940214","headline":"Chaney Lambastes UMass's Calipari","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/14/sports/college-basketball-chaney-lambastes-umass-s-calipari.html","abstract":"  The intense rivalry between Massachusetts and Temple, the leaders of the Atlantic 10 Conference, reached a new level today when Temple Coach John Chaney threatened and nearly came to blows with Massachusetts Coach John Calipari.

Speaking at Congregation Kelilath Jeshurun at 125 East 85th Street, Mrs. Reno was asked several times why she had not included both former city officials in her decision to open a Federal investigation into the death of Mr. Rosenbaum, a rabbinical student who was fatally stabbed when attacked by a group of blacks during street disturbances in Crown Heights.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940215","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/nyregion/c-corrections-190071.html","abstract":"  A picture in some copies yesterday with a rock music review of David Johansen was published in error.
