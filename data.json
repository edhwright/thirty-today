There is a fundamental difference, though, between the two documents. The Republican contract was signed by more than 300 candidates for Congress and presented by their leader, Newt Gingrich. The memo by Ms. Rivlin, a distinguished economist, is a set of hypothetical choices, with no endorsement from President Clinton or anyone else.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941026","headline":"Sports of The Times; What to Do With Sudden Fortunes?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-what-to-do-with-sudden-fortunes.html","abstract":"  HIS timing was usually perfect on the ice.

The supposedly balanced budget that the New York City Council adopted barely four months ago has already developed a huge gap -- $1.1 billion according to Mr. Giuliani, and possibly even more. The Mayor has made impressive headway in reducing the city payroll and negotiating better contracts with city unions. But it is time now to squeeze harder.    If the June reductions were painful, the new cuts will be more so because they carve deeper into programs that have already been trimmed. For the first time, there is a small cut in the police budget. Indeed, the new plan is page after page of mostly small trims, a little here, a little there. The Mayor is headed in the right direction, but the big savings that could right the basic imbalance in the city's finances have yet to happen -- for example, major productivity gains in labor contracts or fundamental welfare reform. Likewise, his search for programs that can be terminated is moving slowly.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941026","headline":"Watergate Redux as Robb Hits Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/us/the-1994-campaign-virginia-watergate-redux-as-robb-hits-back.html","abstract":"  As if the poor voters of Virginia did not have enough scandals to sort through, what with Iran-contra, extramarital rub-downs and cocaine at parties, Charles S.

This is Mr. Kerrey's response to an association's advertisement featuring the actor Charlton Heston, who asserted: \"You said you wouldn't vote for gun bans. But you went to Washington and voted for the first Federal gun ban in American history.\" PRODUCER Struble/Totten Communications ON THE SCREEN Opens with men on a shooting range, with red letters declaring, \"A Message to Charlton Heston from Bob Kerrey.\" The camera zooms in on Mr. Kerrey, dressed in hunting garb, as he fires at a clay pigeon. As he talks into the camera, he ejects the shell from the shotgun he just used, and then, midway through, puts the gun down and picks up another weapon. SCRIPT An announcer says, \"A message for Charlton Heston from Senator Bob Kerrey.\" Then Mr. Kerrey says: \"I'm a hunter, and I believe in the constitutional right to bear arms. When it's time to hunt birds, you need a good gun like this Ruger Red Label. Twenty-five years ago, in the war in Vietnam, people hunted me. They needed a good weapon -- like this AK-47. But you don't need one of these to hunt birds.\" The announcer then says: \"Bob Kerrey. The courage to lead.\" ACCURACY The distinction Mr. Kerrey draws is correct. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that the semi-automatic version of the AK-47 would be covered by the ban in the crime bill, which covers 19 types of semi-automatic weapons. The spokesman also said that shotguns like the Ruger Red Label would be unaffected by the ban. SCORECARD The ad is a tough response to a tough attack: Mr. Kerrey deals head-on with the charge that his support for a ban on semi-automatic weapons was a sellout of Nebraska hunters and gun owners. By word and message, he is trying to tell hunters that he is one of them. And, as is often the case with Mr. Kerrey, his background as a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he lost a leg and won the Medal of Honor, gives a political argument an emotional punch.

The bust of Houdini gracing the monument is a replacement, the original having been stolen long ago. But many of the sites associated with his life and work survive around New York City.\n\nHoudini has become an icon, a name known around the globe, a figure dangling upside down in a straitjacket or plunged into a Water Torture Cell. But Harry Houdini is also a historical figure, an immigrant boy who turned 21 in the 1890's. And though he was born in Hungary and achieved much of his greatest fame in Europe, Houdini went through life a New Yorker. It was in New York that he grew up, kept house and was buried, and in New York, the country's premier magic city, that he presided over the national magic scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941028","headline":"On Stage, and Off","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/28/theater/on-stage-and-off.html","abstract":"  The Drought of Leading Men    Lincoln Center Theater has dropped \"Tonight at 8:30,\" a two-night cycle of seven Noel Coward one-act plays, from its Broadway plans this year.

It works better than you'd think. For kids, there are relentless special effects, from a spaceship that looks like a flying pyramid to spears that turn into rocket launchers. For adults, there is a smartly designed parallel universe that echoes the Egypt of old Bible movies, and the appearance of Jaye Davidson (the androgynous star of \"The Crying Game\") as the sun god, Ra. Try to imagine him voguing around a party at the Temple of Dendur and you'll have the right image. Juggling all this makes \"Stargate\" move more slowly than any action movie should, but it has plenty of enticing moments.   The story begins in Giza, Egypt, in 1928, when archeologists discover a large stone wheel with mysterious symbols carved on it. Leaping to the present, we see James Spader as an Egyptologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson, being laughed off the podium when he suggests that the Egyptians didn't build the pyramids.
