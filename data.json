The owners said talk of a salary cap was not by any means the prevailing view and stressed that the league was not about to abandon its bargaining position on a payroll tax and revert to a cap. But the sentiment exists, and if it does not yet suggest any fundamental change in position, it reflects the bleakness of the negotiating situation for the near future.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"COLLEGE FOOTBALL;\n5-0 Duke Traveling At Head Of Pack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/sports/college-football-50-duke-traveling-at-head-of-pack.html","abstract":"There's little surprise in football circles that an Atlantic Coast Conference member remains unbeaten as the college season reaches its midway point.

Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said today.   The project, the first in the nation to dismantle a licensed commercial nuclear reactor, cost several million dollars less than the $186 million projected. Mr. Kessel said the authority \"got away cheaply\" performing a task that would eventually confront operators of more than 100 commercial reactors now in operation.   \"This is an historic day, not just for the people of Long Island, but for the country,\" he said at a news conference inside the former reactor building.   The plant, proposed in the mid-1960's, never went into commercial operation. Because of fears that safe evacuation of the surrounding area would be impossible in the event of an accident, the former owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, sold Shoreham to the state for $1 in 1992 in an agreement intended to block its operation.   Mr. Kessel said removing the radioactive waste that was produced during testing required 353 truck shipments of more than 5 million pounds of waste to burial and reprocessing sites in South Carolina and Tennessee.   The authority also shipped 560 irradiated fuel assemblies by barge from the plant, which is on Long Island Sound about 60 miles east of Manhattan, to the Philadelphia Electric Company's power plant in Limerick, Pa. The last of 33 barge shipments was made in June.   The pool where fuel rods were stored was drained and irradiated surfaces were ground away, officials said. They said no radiation above normal background levels remained inside the reactor building.   Mr. Kessel today signed a letter informing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that all radioactive material had been removed and other steps taken to comply with decommissioning regulations. He said he expected final approval from the agency by next year to lift all restrictions on use of the plant.   The authority has been studying a possible conversion of Shoreham to a gas-fired power plant.   Construction of Shoreham began in 1973. The plant was nearly completed by 1984, but public opposition to its opening and a lengthy dispute between the company and state and Suffolk County officials over emergency evacuation plans delayed issuance of a Federal operating license until April 1989.   By then the company had agreed with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to abandon the plant in exchange for rate increases and other financial compensation.    A Lilco spokeswoman, Elaine Davis, said today: \"It's been five years since we signed the settlement agreement. We are glad they have completed the decommissioning.\"   Mr. Kessel, who is also the executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, said Governor Cuomo deserved credit for closing the plant. He said operating the plant would have cost Lilco customers, who pay among the highest electric rates in the nation, an additional $1 billion.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/c-corrections-517100.html","abstract":"  A chart in Business Day on Oct. 5, about the effects of a 1978 law that requires utilities to buy power from independent generators, misstated the rates that New York State utilities charge residential customers.

Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar.   While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble; called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers.   Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21.   In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called \"Black Tuesday\" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an \"unmasking trial,\" the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era.   But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence.   \"I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors,\" said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. \"But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame.\"   Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market.   After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured.    Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.)    Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now.   During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar.    With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today.   But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies.   During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. \"Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises,\" he said. If the latter, \"the ruble will continue to fall.\"   Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded.   As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases.   Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation.    Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment.   \"Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen,\" Mr. Lindbaek said. \"In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold.\"   Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs.   Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: \"Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies.\"    Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. \"In contrast to the Russian Government,\" he said, \"the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you.\"   Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. \"We understand what has happened better than anyone,\" she said. \"We understand it with our pockets.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941013","headline":"When Opting to Insult Is Really No Surprise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/metro-matters-when-opting-to-insult-is-really-no-surprise.html","abstract":"  AT that now-infamous police rally at City Hall two years ago, the one that got out of hand over the issue of civilianizing the complaint review board, some speakers attacked Mayor David N.

Her poems feverishly anatomized her moods, her breakdowns, her anxieties, her marriage and her divorce, and they created a continuing self-portrait: Sexton the rebellious teen-ager, obsessed with boys \"and cigarettes and cars\"; Sexton the middle-aged suburban housewife who \"wore rubies and bought tomatoes\"; Sexton the stressed-out mother haunted by \"ugly angels\"; Sexton the emotional invalid, \"queen of this summer hotel\" known as Bedlam.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"A Novelist Sharing Her Lover","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/movies/film-review-a-novelist-sharing-her-lover.html","abstract":"  Diane Kurys's best films carry a resonance beyond the lives of their distinctive characters: \"Peppermint Soda\" is the sweetly comic tale of adolescent girls coming of age, and \"Entre Nous\" the incisive story of female friendship set against World War II and its aftermath. Her lesser films are smaller but still engrossing pictures of tangled relationships, like \"A Man in Love\" and her new work, \"Love After Love,\" the fine, quirky story of a novelist named Lola (Isabelle Huppert). Lola doesn't make that grand artistic leap into the universal, even though her love life sounds like a case study out of \"Smart Women, Foolish Choices.\"    Lola has tried to be reasonable about love, but at 35 the complications are piling up like dirty laundry. She lives with an architect named David, with whom she has a long-term relationship. Along the way, David also became openly involved with Marianne, with whom he has two sons and a continuing connection. Lola accepts this as part of the modern world of grown-ups. Yet she has recently begun a secret affair with Tom, a married songwriter who has two small daughters. \"The two men I love have children,\" she writes in her journal, moaning about the inconvenience of this rather than questioning her own judgment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"Sports of The Times; Socialism Keeps Pack In Green Bay","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/sports/sports-of-the-times-socialism-keeps-pack-in-green-bay.html","abstract":"  EVERY time I hear the name \"Green Bay,\" I conjure up the image of blocky men in clumpy helmets flailing around in a snowstorm, green and yellow uniforms barely visible in some Arctic whiteout, the ugly smell of paper factories overpowered by the pungent aroma of homemade bratwurst.

The suit over financial irregularities involved sloppy, but not criminal, keeping of financial records in an earlier Feinstein campaign and resulted in a $190,000 fine by Federal election officials. Ms. Feinstein did change positions on the death penalty, but the change came long before she ran for the Senate, and Ms. Brown publicly corrected herself on that long before the Huffington advertisement went on the air. Scorecard: The advertisement is one of a several by Mr. Huffington that try to use what others have said to paint Ms. Feinstein as an opportunistic career politician who slings mud and goes out of her way to take care of special interests. From the start, that characterization has been the crux of the Huffington campaign. Feinstein:   The Feinstein campaign also began broadcasting a commercial this week that uses excerpts from newspapers and television broadcasts to attack Representative Huffington. The advertisement runs for 30 seconds and is being seen statewide. On the Screen: Reproductions of headlines and unflattering words about Mr. Huffington, along with an unflattering photograph of Mr. Huffington that shrinks to a single dot. Announcer's voice in background. Producer: Morris and Carrick Script: (Announcer) \"The Chronicle says Michael Huffington is running a fraudulent campaign. Why the lies about Dianne Feinstein? Maybe to hide the truth about him. The Associated Press reports that government records describe Huffington as secretive, threatening and greedy. And Huffington's company falsified documents to cover up its violations of national security laws. His company stiffed taxpayers for millions. But Huffington still won't release his tax returns. Secretive, threatening, greedy. Congressman Huffington. The Texas oil millionaire Californians just can't trust.\" Accuracy: The \"fraudulent campaign\" conclusion was subjective, as was the accusation of \"lies.\" The quotations from the Associated Press were not based on government conclusions about Mr. Huffington but instead were opinions offered by Huffington business competitors in lawsuits. Huffington family companies have been fined by the Government for violating international trade regulations prohibiting overseas sales of law enforcement equipment, and some have encountered financial difficulties that resulted in disputes over tax liability. Mr. Huffington, a wealthy former Texan, refuses to release his tax returns. Scorecard: The advertisement is one of several by Ms. Feinstein that try to use what others have said to paint Mr. Huffington as a wealthy carpetbagger from Texas who refuses to come clean with his personal and business dealings, many inept and possibly shady, and thus cannot be trusted to serve in the Senate. That characterization has been the crux of the Feinstein campaign in the latter phases of the race.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941014","headline":"Wallmanstal Journal; Can a Post-Apartheid Army Ever Get in Step?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/world/wallmanstal-journal-can-a-post-apartheid-army-ever-get-in-step.html","abstract":"  From the day in April when disgruntled troops set their commander's car on fire, it was clear that South Africa's plan to forge a new army out of old enemies was not going to unfold without a few glitches.

The first criticism appears true; the city wants to transfer health workers off the city budget in order to create the appearance of deep personnel cuts. But the plan also makes good health-care sense.    Merging city clinics with those the H.H.C. already runs is a smart way to bring quality health care within easy reach of the city's poor. City clinics focus on immunization and other children's preventive services. H.H.C. clinics provide comprehensive primary care for the entire family. In some neighborhoods, city and H.H.C. clinics are near each other and underutilized. A merger would cut the waste. The merger allows the H.H.C. to do what the city cannot: create a network of primary-care clinics throughout the city that are backed up by hospital facilities for patients who need specialists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941014","headline":"An Immigrant's Lifelong Journey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/arts/art-review-an-immigrant-s-lifelong-journey.html","abstract":"  Luis Cruz Azaceta left Cuba for New York in 1960 when he was 18, just after the revolution that brought Castro to power.

Among them are the harsh-colored \"Window Display\" (1979) -- a comic-paranoic view of Manhattan as a bad-dream assemblage of weapons, severed limbs and the Empire State Building stabbed through with a knife -- and a 1981 rainbow-colored self-portrait suggestive of 60's psychedelic poster art.

The camera pans around the room to various Cuomo children and grandchildren listening as the patriarch talks about crime. SCRIPT Mr. Cuomo: \"We'll never forget when Matilda was mugged. And I still worry when my daughters are out alone at night. Crime touches too many of us. That's why we've doubled state prisons in taking criminals off the streets in record numbers. Now, I want to ban assault weapons and put career criminals away for life. But we also must give young people hope of a good future before they are seduced by drugs and money. We're making progress, but not enough. My job is to keep fighting to make life safer for all our families.\" SCORECARD Amid a storm of attack ads against State Senator George E. Pataki, his Republican opponent, this is Mr. Cuomo's first spot in recent weeks that focuses on his own record and plans. It operates on several levels. He lets viewers see his family -- a textbook trick for politicians seeking to seem softer or more human -- and says he has a personal reason to share their worries. He defends his record, which he has not always found easy because of his opposition to the death penalty. Finally, he says that fighting crime ultimately hinges on prevention, a message that sells big with his base of liberal and black Democratic voters.    Though firm, this is no war whoop on crime; the question is whether it is what most voters want to hear, especially from the incumbent who led the state during 12 violent years, despite three years of dropping crime statistics.

at this season's first performance of Richard Strauss's \"Arabella\" at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday night, was the voice of the composer. The orchestra was its vehicle, making pronouncements that were compassionate and ironic, invoking waltzes and polkas, Slavic folk tunes and Mozartean allusions. And as conducted by Christian Thielemann, the young German musician who made his impressive Met debut leading \"Der Rosenkavalier\" two seasons ago, the orchestra was also the dominant force of the opera, not supporting the singers so much as daring them to hang on for the lush, exotic ride.   Mr. Thielemann often erred on the side of overly emphatic gesture, and occasionally seemed so swept up in Strauss's intoxicating flow of motif and melody that the singers seemed extraneous. There were many times, too, partly because of the symphonic size of the orchestral sound and partly because of the generally wan character of the cast, when the singers had no choice but to remain extraneous.   10-15-94","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/style/chronicle-538370.html","abstract":"  When LINDA SUNSHINE, an editor at Stewart, Tabori & Chang, first had the idea of pairing the words of NTOZAKE SHANGE with the paintings of the late Romare Bearden in a book, she had no idea that the two had ever met, much less had a longstanding friendship.

In the case of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra that curiosity is focused more sharply because the orchestra is in the market for a new music director. Lorin Maazel, its director since 1984, announced that he would leave in 1996 to devote himself to composition.    Has Mr. Maazel done for his orchestra what Leonard Slatkin did for the St. Louis Symphony? Hardly. Mr. Maazel's concerts with his orchestra at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings suggest that a more apt comparison is with the National Symphony Orchestra at the end of Mstislav Rostropovich's tenure.

ROBB, DEMOCRAT The Robb campaign began showing this 30-second commercial statewide on Thursday, in part as a response to a new North campaign commercial that began on Wednesday. PRODUCER: Doak Shrum Harris Carrier Devine of Arlington, Va. ON THE SCREEN: Alternating images of Mr. Robb, talking to voters, and Mr. North, in Marine uniform, with newspaper headlines from the Iran-contra scandal like \"North lied to conceal gift, witness tells jury.\" SCRIPT: After lying about President Reagan and even lying to schoolchildren, now Oliver North is lying about Chuck Robb. Chuck Robb has never had anything to do with illegal drugs. Period.   But what North doesn't understand is that the real issue in this campaign is the candidate's record of public service. Chuck Robb has a proven record of public service, while North's public record includes putting himself above the law by selling arms to terrorists and backdating documents to conceal that some of the money went for his personal use.   Oliver North. People are starting to wonder if he knows what the truth is. ACCURACY: Mr. North recently told some high school students he did not lie to Congress. He did so under the assumption, he said later, that the questioner was referring to his open Congressional testimony, which Mr. North has always said was truthful. Mr. North has acknowledged misleading members of Congress in closed session. The assertion about drugs is based on Mr. Robb's denials of accusations that he attended parties where people were using illegal drugs. He has acknowledged attending the parties in question. The accusations that he knew of the drug use or was somehow involved have never been proved, but have trailed him for years. SCORECARD: The commercial would appear to be of the preaching-to-the-converted variety, reflecting accusations against Mr. North that are well-known to Virginia voters and, in general, do not seem to bother North supporters. If the commercial is aimed at North supporters or even the shrinking population of undecided voters in the state, it does not look or sound incendiary enough to lure people into the Robb camp, especially because the episodes cited have been thoroughly examined before. OLIVER L. NORTH, REPUBLICAN In his latest advertising assault, a 30-second commercial running throughout Virginia, Mr. North uses newspaper headlines and a Playboy magazine cover to dramatize his view of Mr. Robb as a flawed candidate. PRODUCER: Murphy Pintak and Gautier Agency of Arlington, Va. ON THE SCREEN: A black and white, slow-motion close-up shot of Mr. Robb serves as background for reproductions of newspaper articles, a Playboy cover and a list of four Robb acquaintances convicted of drug charges. SCRIPT: Why can't Chuck Robb tell the truth? About the cocaine parties where Robb said he never saw drugs. Then four of his party friends were sent to prison for dealing cocaine. Or about the beauty queen in the hotel room in New York. Robb says it was only a massage.   Chuck Robb lived a lie and violated his oath of good faith to the people, writes The Richmond Times-Dispatch. Character counts, and North has it all over Robb. ACCURACY: With provocative, suggestive references to issues that have dogged Mr. Robb since the 1980's, the commercial leaves the impression Mr. Robb has not provided a full accounting of the events, which occurred when he was Governor. Mr. Robb has acknowledged attending parties, and people he knew were convicted of drug offenses. He has always said that he never saw drugs being used and that he never used them. He has admitted having had relationship with the woman on the Playboy cover, Tai Collins, a former Miss Virginia, whom the magazine cover identifies as \"the woman Senator Charles Robb couldn't resist,\" but Mr. Robb said the relationship only went so far as the one night in New York, where he said she gave him a massage. SCORECARD: In a scorching attack on Mr. Robb's character that plays well to the conservative Republicans who support Mr. North, the commercial relies on hot-button phrases like \"cocaine parties,\" \"dealing cocaine\" and \"beauty queen\" and an image of a Playboy centerfold to link Mr. Robb with questionable behavior. Mr. Robb has never been proved to have been involved with drugs, and he has apologized to his wife, Linda, and voters for conduct \"not appropriate for a married man.\" Further, by asserting that Mr. North's character is superior to Mr. Robb's, the commercial presumes that flaws of a professional nature, like Mr. North's involvement in the Iran-contra scandal, are less offensive than flaws of a personal nature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941015","headline":"BRIEFCASE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/your-money/IHT-briefcase.html","abstract":"In next week's Money Report: a survey of international real estate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"Let's Look Closer at Border Control Numbers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/opinion/l-let-s-look-closer-at-border-control-numbers-538396.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   You report on a crackdown on illegal crossings at the United States-Mexico border in an Oct. 6 news article.

Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres both played key roles in securing the peace agreement, and the Nobel Committee was right to have them share the honor. The two fought bitterly over the leadership and direction of Israel's Labor Party for many years.

Though Iraq's intentions were scarcely innocent, the crisis eased without any shots being fired or borders crossed.    With good reason, Washington would like to avoid massive mobilization every time Mr. Hussein chooses to stir up a crisis. It would also prefer not having to wait until Iraqi troops actually cross the Kuwaiti border before the sheikdom's defenders can strike back.   Washington is now canvassing support for a Security Council resolution that would demand that Iraq withdraw the reinforcements and special units it recently moved south. From now on, under the resolution, Iraq would have to limit its forces in southern Iraq to those present before the latest crisis began, and even these would have to avoid threatening deployments near the Kuwaiti border. Those demands are justified, given Baghdad's repeated threats and menacing actions. The vote could come as soon as today.    Most other members of the international coalition that has worked together containing Iraq for the past four years support those demands. But how to enforce them is another matter. China, Russia and France, among others, are reluctant to follow up the resolution with an explicit threat of force against offending Iraqi troop movements so long as they are confined to Iraqi territory.    American interests in the region are strong enough to justify unilateral U.S. military action in certain circumstances. But the Clinton Administration should be extremely cautious about driving new wedges into an already divided coalition or setting precedents for unilateral action that others might exploit -- for example, Russia in the case of former Soviet Republics.   China's main concern is sovereignty and protection of its own freedom of action from U.N. intrusion. Russia and France are frankly interested in doing business with an internationally rehabilitated Iraq. All three also have good reasons to discourage future Iraqi aggression. But they insist that Saddam Hussein's behavior, including his cooperation with arms inspectors, can most effectively be influenced not merely by threats and punishments but by a careful combination of positive and negative incentives.    No doubt the U.S. and its British allies alone can manage the military defense of Kuwait. But denying Iraq the ability to sell its oil or buy new weapons on the international market requires maintaining a consensus of all major and Mideastern powers.    That consensus was already in danger of fraying a few weeks ago on the oil sanctions issue because of Washington's overly creative interpretation of U.N. resolutions spelling out what Iraq had to do to get relief. By rashly sending its troops southward, Baghdad reunited the allies and temporarily patched up the divisions over future oil sales.    But any new U.S. attempt to go beyond a Security Council consensus on enforcement risks doing more harm than good. It would move the U.S. military closer to the unenviable role of global police force, even as it weakened the long-term containment of Iraq.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941015","headline":"Now Esiason Can Move; Jets Hope to Do Same","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/15/sports/pro-football-now-esiason-can-move-jets-hope-to-do-same.html","abstract":"  If the Jets defeat the Patriots Sunday -- and just because it's at home doesn't guarantee a smashing performance -- Coach Pete Carroll might want to consider giving a game ball to the trainers.

The five had an open trial by an independent court. Video recording of the interrogation made public by the prosecutor tarnished claims by four defendants of being tortured or intimidated by electric chair, a practice that is nonexistent in Albania.   At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg this month the chairman, Klaus Kinkel of Germany, declared that \"the trial procedures observed Albanian law, and there was no tendency to influence the courts.\"   It is regrettable to see the Greek minority in Albania become an instrument of the questionable policies of Athens and the hypernationalist elements of the Greek lobby in the United States.   Since the fall of the Communist regime the situation of the Greek minority has tremendously improved. It has schools, from elementary to university level, where 62 percent of the teaching is in Greek. It publishes three independent newspapers and has its own broadcasts.    The ethnic Greeks in Albania move freely to Greece (so far as Greece lets them in). They hold unrestricted religious services and have a political party, the Human Rights Union, with two elected representatives in Parliament.   The size of the Greek minority has been exaggerated. A reliable index would be the votes gathered by their party in national elections.
