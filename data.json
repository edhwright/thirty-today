At least that's what viewers ought to think for more than the fraction of a second that the seriously mistimed \"Blown Away\"  allows. It's no surprise that Mr. Jones is brewing a bomb, and such lack of suspense is a pretty big problem in a thriller about a mad bomber.         \"Blown Away\" tries to be much more than that, of course. The film might have  been the thinking person's \"Speed,\" adding character and dialogue, even ideas, to action.

He played the piano as if it were the third rail of a subway track. Every key his fingers touched sent his body into convulsions. His vocals were just as spare and expressive. In \"Knock on Wood,\" he shifted from a long, low melisma to a punchy falsetto, isolating soul music,  the genre that his early work gave birth to, into its separate components of gospel and rhythm-and-blues.

Balancing the right of patients and employees to unimpeded access to the abortion clinic against the protesters' right to free speech, the Court upheld a buffer zone of about 36 feet around the clinic in Melbourne, Fla., that kept protesters away from the entrance and parking lot and off a public right-of-way. Chief Justice Rehnquist said the buffer zone \"burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake.\" Under the same analysis, the Court also upheld a ban on excessive noise during the clinic's operating hours, finding the restrictions justified by the need to \"insure the health and well-being of the patients at the clinic.\" [Excerpts, page A16.]   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940701","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/arts/art-in-review-014435.html","abstract":"    'American Realism and Impressionism' 'Drawings, Prints and Photographs' Metropolitan Museum of Art Fifth Avenue at 82d Street Through July 24   ","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940701","headline":"Supreme Court Ups and Downs;The Voting Rights Wreckers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/opinion/supreme-court-ups-and-downs-the-voting-rights-wreckers.html","abstract":"The Supreme Court chipped away again yesterday at efforts to give minority voters greater voice under the Federal Voting Rights Act.

But who rules zydeco? That question sent the documentary film maker Robert Mugge to Lake Charles, Lawtell, Eunice and other zydeco strongholds for his latest music documentary, \"The Kingdom of Zydeco,\" which is the midnight show tonight and tomorrow at Cinema Village. There are also morning shows today, tomorrow and Monday at 11:45.         It's a question of royal succession. Clifton Chenier was the undisputed king  of zydeco until his death in 1987. At that point, Rockin' Dopsie, who had called himself the crown prince, began wearing a crown.

The first exhibition to bask in the one-third-larger, more open, light-infused two-story space is that of the basket maker Hisako Sekijima. \n\nMs. Sekijima's distinction is in cherishing open space as much as the forms she creates to extol it. She starts from the inside, conjuring a vacuum, then creating a basket-sculpture to surround it. The artist, who was born in Japan, has lived in the United States and France as well, and she has studied contemporary basket making, American Indian basketry and splint basketry. \n\nHer works have been exhibited at the American Craft Museum, the California Craft Museum and Hokkaido-Asahikawa Museum. They are part of the permanent collections of the Erie Art Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Hawaii State Foundation for Culture and Art.\n\nShe is also the author of books on basket making including \"Basketry: Projects From Baskets to Grass Slippers\" (Kodansha International Ltd., Japan) and presents workshops and lectures throughout the United States and Japan.\n\nHer constructions are woven of natural materials -- bamboo, wisteria, kudzu vine, mulberry and willow bark. In what the artist considers a collaboration with nature, Ms. Sekijima said, \"I let my materials do the talking.\"\n\nThe exhibition, on view through July 17 at the six-year-old gallery owned by Rhonda Brown and Tom Grotta, exudes a feeling of spatial containment common in Japanese sculpture and related to Zen concepts.\n\nIn balancing material and space, form and volume, Ms. Sekijima thinks of space as a negative as opposed to the positive of tangible materials like vine, sticks or bark.\n\nIn her view, the part that the materials fill has a value equal to that where they do not exist, as in the relation of positive and negative. The result, said Janet Kopolos, senior editor of \"Art in America\" and author of \"Contemporary Japanese Sculpture\" (Abbeville Press, New York City), is work that \"cannot be physically or conceptually distinguished from sculpture.\"\n\nEach of the 12 pieces in the exhibition, which took a year to prepare, has its own distinctive identity. \"We had seen her work, but not two that were similar, when Jack Lenor Larsen, the textile designer, author and great cheerleader for crafts, came to dinner,\" Mr. Grotta said. \"We asked him who he thought belonged in our gallery. She was the No. 1 artist recommended.\"\n\nBecause each piece is a distinct form, as if made by a different artist, each invites study and the search for a common thread. The pieces are grouped in a living-room setting, on long low tables backing two black leather sofas. One, an airy cylindrical form that resembles a maze of tree branches, \"is the favorite basket of almost everyone who walks in,\" Mr. Grotta said. \"Its strength lies in the infinite knots made of kudzu vine that give it shape, structure and stability. People are drawn to it for its airy quality and puzzle-like maze of knots.\"\n\nAlthough there are always spaces to be found in Ms. Sekijima's work, one piece called \"Fittings,\" made of cherry bark fastened by knots of maple splint, is more substantial and looks like ceramic. Her use of knots here led to another exploration and to a piece using randomly interlaced bamboo in what became inner and outer bowl-shape baskets. Fitted ever so casually together, they emphasize angles as well as space.\n\nA coiled sphere, pleated of walnut bark with the texture of leather, has openings large enough to poke a finger through.\n\nMr. Grotta suggested that a piece shaped like an envelope was more traditional and in the Japanese esthetic. The sculpture is made of willow wood and bark, is folded and simply but strikingly stitched and has Henry Moore-like openings that invite viewers. \n\nOther pieces include a wreath-shape bowl of highly textured, light berry shavings wrapped and stitched in contrasting dark willow as well as a wall piece of six square panels hung together to form a rectangular form. \nWhite Oak and Coralberry Root\n\n Although the baskets of the current exhibition are displayed in the living room, viewers are treated to an art-infused home with works from top weavers and basket makers from the moment they step over the threshold. \n\nAt the entrance, for example, is a bassinet of white oak and coralberry root by Sharon and Leon Niehues, woven for but now outgrown by the owners' 1-year-old son, Carter. In the youngster's room there are wall hangings, mobiles and sculptured basket works that seem fit for a future connoisseur. \n\n\"Basket making over the last 10 years has made a transition from traditional and functional to the creation of contemporary baskets as an art form,\" Rhonda Brown said. \"And Ms. Sekijima's work with the use of traditional material and traditional techniques but nontraditional structures makes that clear.\"\n\nThe Brown/Grotta Gallery (39 Grumman Hill Road, Wilton; 834-0623) is open by appointment.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"A Drive for Court Interpreters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/a-drive-for-court-interpreters.html","abstract":"AN assault trial was in its second day in District Court in Suffolk County in Islip when the defendant whispered to his lawyer that the Spanish interpreter was consistently misinterpreting important phrases.\n\nThe lawyer, Sherry Lee Speal of Babylon, told the judge, Ralph F.

Yet, she concluded, \"no one is going to go and see a film about politics.\"   Her approach, then, was to look for the man behind Thomas Jefferson the Great American. And, in that sense, she was lucky. The years that Jefferson spent in Paris as President Washington's Ambassador, 1784 to 1789, provided a rare window to the hidden passions of this introspective man.

In 1965 Thomas Darling's last heir, Sila Berenice Baldwin, had summoned Mr. Whitlock for a conversation about her family's possessions.

The family home was filled, he knew, with original furnishings from a house that was built from 1772 to 1774.

Not too long after, in 1904, Mr. Gravereaux donated 6,000 roses from l'Hay to the city of Paris to start the rose garden at Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne, the city's vast park of over 2,000 acres. The Bagatelle, an 18th century house surrounded by extensive gardens, includes the sumptuous two-acre rose garden. Planted with 11,000 rosebushes of over 850 varieties, it is in bloom throughout the summer.\n\nMr. Gravereaux and J. C. N.

With a cast of more than 50 performers playing against the magnificent backdrop of the Hudson River and the Jersey skyline, \"Stonewall: Night Variations\" celebrates both a birthday and a battle. The occasion: the 25th anniversary of the Greenwich Village riots that are now accepted as the start of the gay liberation movement.   It was on the night of June 27, 1969, that a routine police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a Christopher Street hangout for homosexuals, run by the Mafia, prompted not cowed obedience from the customers but uncharacteristic fury and outrage. Just why is anybody's guess now. Some say it was the heat of the night. Others say it had something to do with the death of Judy Garland five days before in London. Whatever the reason, patience had run out. Bricks and bottles were thrown. In the aftermath of the melee, gays and lesbians left closets, never to return.

Chief among these, he reveals, was his upbringing in Virginia, where racial segregation both deeply wounded his youthful pride and helped inspire his distinctive quiet determination. Filled with his thoughts on spirituality and his battle with AIDS, the book concludes with a letter to his young daughter, Camera.

IDENTITY: Actor; brother of the actresses Rosanna and Patricia Arquette. AGE: 24. RECENT STAGE PROJECT: Just finished playing Lee Harvey Oswald in the Steppenwolf Theater's production in Chicago of \"Libra,\" directed by John Malkovich. CURRENT MOVIE ROLES: Jack in \"Jack Be Nimble,\" a Gothic horror film from New Zealand, and Bill in \"Grief,\" a film about the writers on a cheesy television show. Q.  How did you approach playing Oswald? A.  When most people play a villain, they play him as bad. They forget that people who do bad things don't see themselves that way. I imagined him as someone who was manipulated, who had a story to tell and never got to tell it. I played him like an Everyman. Q. How did the cast react to the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis? A.  Our show has a lot of technical aspects to it. We show the Zapruder film. The night she died, for the first time, we had technical difficulties. Even the mice in cages backstage got loose, and no one could explain why. There was talk of our being haunted.   Q.  Tell me about the character you play in \"Pulp Fiction,\" which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. A.  I haven't seen it yet, so it depends what wasn't left on the cutting room floor. He's a drug underling who is supposed to make the two hit men doubt their passion for killing. Q.  The 1990 movie \"Last Exit to Brooklyn\" was your big break, right?  A.  It was my first acting job really. My sister Patricia was asked to play the Jennifer Jason Leigh role, but she was pregnant. She went to New York to tell them no in person. She said, \"Lexy, come with me.\" The next thing I knew my sister's agent was telling me that they wanted me to play Georgette. I thought they were just using me to get Patricia to take the role. Q.  Had you ever done drag before? A.  Only in a sophomoric way on Halloween. I began researching by going to drag clubs. Though the movie is set in the 50's, I figured things were the same. I befriended these performers who were flamboyant and talented, yes, but they weren't Georgette. She was an addict. She didn't dress to be glamorous. She was a subversive beatnik. Q.  Since then you've created other drag characters, like Eva Destruction, which you perform at clubs. Are you worried about being known as \"that actor who does drag\"? A.  I'm not a career drag queen. I certainly don't make money out of it. Now I mostly do it for benefits. People try to trivialize it, and say it's just drag. Mike Myers as Linda Richman and Dana Carvey as Church Lady have become famous with their drag roles.  Q.  Would you ever dress up as one of your sisters? A.  Patricia was meant to judge a fashion show at a club in L.A. She couldn't make it. I threw together an outfit that was identical to her costume in \"True Romance.\" We simply introduced me as Patricia Arquette to the audience. I came over later and showed her. Q.  I hear you were upset that Patrick Swayze got the role you wanted in \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,\" the road movie about three drag queens that Steven Spielberg is producing. A.  Patrick Swayze's far too old and far too straight in my opinion. It's fine if straight actors want to play gay roles because I'm a gay actor who also wants to play straight roles. Of course, Tom Hanks was great in \"Philadelphia.\" But I do have a problem that three drag queens are being played by three straight actors. It makes me want to run away and do films in Turkey or India. Q.  Is that why you went to New Zealand to make \"Jack Be Nimble\"? A.  When I read the script, I was just stricken by the beauty of it and the kitsch black humor. It's my favorite work to date. It's like all the movies I love, like \"Carrie\" and \"The Exorcist\" and \"Eating Raoul.\"  Q.  What's next for you? A.  The only thing I know I'm doing for sure is a film called \"Forget-Me-Nots,\" with John Malkovich, which is going to be another one that gay groups won't like. It's about an unstable man who kills his lover after learning that his lover is H.I.V. positive and hasn't told him. I'm going to be a character that John uses as an alibi.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Checking Up on Manny at Midseason","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-washington-heights-local-hero-update-checking-up-manny.html","abstract":"  Out on the ball fields of Washington Heights, the buzz is still about Manny (Ramirez, that is, the Cleveland Indians' rookie right fielder and the pride of Washington Heights).

But beyond the obvious myopia of Ms. Quindlen are several larger, if uncomfortable, truths: There are a multiplicity of thresholds involved in acts of violence. Very few women subject to battering are murdered.

An analysis of election returns challenges the totem that members of the Hasidic sect in Crown Heights reflexively vote as an organized bloc in every election. But the analysis suggests that while they account for fewer voters than some other Hasidic sects and their concerns about Israel may weigh more heavily in their political calculations, when they are galvanized by an issue or a candidate, members of the Lubavitch movement, like those of many other groups, can be monolithic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Less Stress From a Day In the Courts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/less-stress-from-a-day-in-the-courts.html","abstract":"  Hya Jones was simmering with frustration.

The most lionized woman writer of the 19th century was, of course, also a famous femme fatale, as notorious for her affairs with Alfred de Musset, Frederic Chopin and many less accomplished men as for the dozens of freewheeling and intellectual novels, plays and essays she wrote. There is no better way to glimpse just how fatale a femme she was than to visit the exquisitely frivolous and irresistibly named museum devoted to her jewels, furniture and family portraits: Le Musee de la Vie Romantique, the Museum of Romantic Life. One of the newest museums in Paris -- just a dozen years old -- it is one of the city's most charming and eccentric secrets.   The modest, shuttered three-story house and separate painter's studio are set in a courtyard on the Rue Chaptal, a tiny side street on the fringe of Montmartre. A five-minute walk will lead to one of the most garish parts of the city, where the Moulin Rouge stands guard over sex shops and seedy characters. Another 10 minutes and you will be at Sacre-Coeur, which seems dangerously like a cathedral to tourism. Le Musee de la Vie Romantique ignores all that; it calmly and deliberately lets the present slip away. Unfashionably cluttered -- with patterned wallpaper and vitrines crammed with baubles -- it conveys the ornate texture of 19th-century artistic life, when everyone who had ever held a pen or paintbrush also knew how to hold a salon.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"Paper's Small But Issues Are Life-Size","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-brownsville-paper-s-small-but-issues-are-life-size.html","abstract":"  Ginnie Rumore is a school nurse, but she also considers herself something of a cub reporter.

Bruised feelings abound and question marks remain. Still, after two years of crisis and nine months past its projected unveiling last September, the new American Center in Paris is open at last.   The opening party, with American and French V.I.P.'s prowling about Frank Gehry's playful, commanding new building on the Rue de Bercy and the adjacent new park, was on June 7; the public was admitted the next day. The June 7 date was chosen to connect with the June 6 D-Day celebrations, and perhaps initially in the hope that a Clinton or two might grace the center. In the end, center officials had to go over to the American Embassy in Paris for Hillary Rodham Clinton to proclaim the facility open.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"In the Region/New Jersey;\nA Spate of New Rental Housing for the Elderly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/realestate/in-the-regionnew-jersey-a-spate-of-new-rental-housing-for-the.html","abstract":"HAVING withstood the recession's impact better than most of New Jersey's other residential segments, rental housing for people age 60 and over is now moving ahead at a brisk pace.\n\nEvidence of that is a spate of projects -- both market-rate and for low- and/or moderate-income tenants, known as affordable housing -- that have been planned, begun or completed across the state.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19940703","headline":"CHILDREN'S BOOKS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/books/children-s-books-471305.html","abstract":"  HOW GEORGIE RADBOURN SAVED BASEBALL Written and illustrated by David Shannon.
