The duty of the civilian conscripts, they say, was nettoyage, \"cleaning up\" -- killing the survivors.   But it is unlikely that the several hundred prisoners held in Kibungo will come to trial in the near, or even foreseeable, future. In early August, the United States and the United Nations secured a promise from the new Government of Rwanda that it would not prosecute anyone for genocide.

The missed payment was widely denounced at the time by union officials and players, who called it an inflammatory act on the owners' part, and it added to the bitterness that has characterized the relationship between the two sides.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940907","headline":"Yes, What's Past Is Past; Hextall Hopes It Isn't Goals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/sports/hockey-yes-what-s-past-is-past-hextall-hopes-it-isn-t-goals.html","abstract":"  Ron Hextall isn't one to make excuses.   \"Last year was probably my worst year ever,\" Hextall, the Islander goalie, said today at training camp. \"But I think I learned from it.

(AP) DOG SHOW  A Boxer Has Her Day  Champion Jacquet's Cambridge Fortune, a Brindle Boxer owned by Ikuko Ohtani, William Dunn and Richard Tomita yesterday was named best of 1,077 dogs at the 61st all-breed show of the Rockland County Kennel Club at Bowline Point Park, in Haverstraw, N.Y. It was the third top award for Casey, as the 3-year-old bitch is called, and she was handled by Marylou Hatfield. It was an exceptionally strong final, with six of the seven dogs previous winners of a top award. Among them they had amassed 110 bests. \"It's easier to find a male boxer, who is robust, well put together and looks like he can work, but to find all of that in a bitch, who still is very feminine, is remarkable and she truly is remarkable,\" said Anitra Cuneo, the judge.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940909","headline":"TRANSACTIONS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/sports/transactions-191698.html","abstract":"  Baseball  American League   BOSTON RED SOX -- Named Gary Rajsich scout.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940909","headline":"HEAR THIS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/style/IHT-hear-this.html","abstract":"Allen Ginsberg may be counterculture, bearded and everything but he's not careless with things.

Mr. Doherty, who made the short list of this year's prestigious and closely watched Turner Prize, which is awarded annually in November by the Tate Gallery in London, was born and reared and continues to live and work in Londonderry, a town that has seen some of the worst of the troubles and was the site of the 1968 riot that ignited them.

When a teen-ager accidentally discovers his grandfather's saxophone, it opens up a painful chapter of family history that had been kept secret. It turns out that in the 1940's, the grandfather, Kansas (Keith David), and his brother, Teddy (Harry Lennix), played together in an up-and-coming Harlem jazz band. Most of the film is an extended flashback in which Kansas recalls the devastating consequences of his own professional and sexual envy of his more talented brother.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940909","headline":"The Castro Alternative","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/opinion/the-castro-alternative.html","abstract":"The Cuban refugee crisis is largely being shaped by the converging but diametrically opposite motivations of two strong-willed Cuban leaders: Fidel Castro and Jorge Mas Canosa, the head of the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation.

The Cuban economy is collapsing -- most hopes for its revival were based on tourism and foreign investment, which have been dashed by the current crisis.

NEIL STRAUSS Still Improvising    Derek Bailey Quartet, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. In the 1980 book \"Improvisation,\" the guitarist Derek Bailey contends that improvisation is the most widely practiced musical activity, but the least acknowledged and understood. He ought to know. As a pick-up musician in the 1950's and a studio musician in the 1960's, he learned a lot about discipline and restriction before striking out on his own in search of freedom. Three decades later, he's still twisting his tuning pegs, whittling atonal guitar lines, and breaking for periods of silence. He has become one of the most technically adept performers in a genre that has pretty much remained unacknowledged and misunderstood. He performs with the saxophonist Peter Brotzmann, the drummer Gregg Bendian and the bassist Skuli Sverrisson tonight and tomorrow night at 10. Admission: $10. N.

Led by Ben Daughtrey, a reformed hardcore rock musician, Love Jones croons self-consciously slick retro-rock songs colored with light brush strokes of bossa nova, soul and doo-wop. The band sometimes tries too hard to imitate a style of music characterized by its effortlessness, but that's only part of its charm. Doors open at 8 P.M. admission is $8. N.

Nicolaas Biegman of the Netherlands, the usually restrained vice chairman of the conference's main drafting committee, vented exasperation at the increasingly wide gulf between the maneuvering over abortion and the central question of how the world is to stabilize its population, currently estimated at 5.67 billion people, at a supposedly sustainable 7.27 billion by the year 2015.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940909","headline":"Mullen's Status Still Uncertain","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/09/sports/mullen-s-status-still-uncertain.html","abstract":"  Brian Mullen met with Islander General Manager Don Maloney today to discuss his status with the team.

Television is something they can only watch. Incumbent's Advantage    As a result, changing the campaign-finance laws to limit the advantages of incumbency is one of the few issues on which the two doctors agree.
