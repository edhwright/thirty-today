It may not have looked like the beginning of a monthlong series devoted to the work of a major composer, but that's exactly what it was. On Wednesday night, the Knitting Factory started what might be called its Zorniad, marking Mr. Zorn's 40th year. The Knitting Factory is the appropriate place for the project, since Mr. Zorn has performed there regularly and collaborated with a good percentage of the club's other headliners.   The retrospective began with juvenilia. \"Caevorrys,\" written when the composer was 12 years old, received what Mr. Zorn called its \"first and probably last public performance.\" \"Caevorrys\" (for clarinet, flute, piano and \"frequency generator,\" now a synthesizer) presaged later work. Mr. Zorn likes texture, noise, sudden changes and raucousness; he doesn't have much use for melody or smooth transitions. He has cited the contemporary classical composer Mauricio Kagel and the free-jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler as influences; both modern musics encouraged his own love of cacophony and crunch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"1918: Biting Hindenburg : IN OUR PAGES: 100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/opinion/IHT-1918-biting-hindenburg-in-our-pages-100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - Canadian and English troops, attacking just before dawn yesterday [Sept. 2], behind a monster array of tanks, have bitten deeply into the Qu√©ant-Drocourt line, a switch of the Hindenburg line, and dealt the German a staggering blow at one of","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Review/Film; Life and Death at the Edge: The Story of a Drag Queen","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/movies/review-film-life-and-death-at-the-edge-the-story-of-a-drag-queen.html","abstract":"  International Chrysis, the Bronx-born drag queen who is the subject of the documentary film \"Split,\" had long red hair, a ferociously engaging smile and oversized breasts that she liked to show off in New York City nightspots like La Vie en Rose and Club 82.

He claimed Saturn as his birthplace and filled his lyrics with interstellar imagery. Unlike most jazz films, \"Space Is the Place,\" which opens today at the Walter Reade Theater, doesn't bother with the composer's biography, although it does offer glimpses of Ra's Intergalactic Myth-Science Solar Arkestra. Most of the time, however, it proffers fantasies to match the hallucinatory music. Made in 1974, it's already an artifact of a time when the hangover of the late 1960's met the disillusioned 1970's; black power and free jazz collided with the fashion sense of Superfly. \"Space Is the Place\" is the \"Putney Swope\" of jazz films.   In the movie's episodic plot, Sun Ra -- dressed in full glitter-Egyptian regalia -- lives on a bluish planet populated entirely by black people. He comes to Earth, in a spaceship that looks like a pair of bloodshot eyeballs painted on a rubber raft, to recruit more black colonists and to philosophize. \"Are you ready to alter your destiny?\" he asks.   On Earth, Ra has run-ins with two black opponents, an obeisant newscaster and the diabolical Mr. Overseer, and two white Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. There's a vignette in a mid-1940's jazz club in Chicago (where Ra's piano-playing is too avant-garde for the management), a cosmic card game and some proselytizing at an inner-city youth center, where one teen-ager dismisses Ra as \"some old hippie.\" \"How do we know you're for real?\" another asks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Police Identify 13th Body As Victim of L.I.

Now theater songs by George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and Leonard Bernstein are being redefined as the heart of the American art-song repertory.

Dinkins begins broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials, in addition to the three ads already on the air. One of the new ads features city-built ballfields in vacant lots, the other expanded library service. The campaign says its ad buy for the week is $305,000, enough for a typical viewer to see a Dinkins ad 8 or 10 times in that period.   ON THE SCREEN Images of David Meadvin, 9-year-old campaign voluteer walking to East Elmhurst public library branch in Queens, using computer card catalogue, pulling book off shelf, sitting at table perusing book with Mr. Dinkins and walking down aisle. Ends with facsimile of Mayor's signature on screen with silent slogan: \"One City. One Future.\"   PRODUCER Doak, Shrum, Harris, Carrier, Devine of Washington.   THE SCRIPT Narrator's voice: When David Meadvin goes to the library, he opens more than a book. He opens doors to the future. There was another young man who long ago learned lessons like that in his own life. And today, as Mayor of New York, in the face of Federal cutbacks and budget crisis, he's fought to open city libraries six days a week, for the first time in almost half a century. Because of David Dinkins, libraries are about more than buildings and books. They're about New York's children and what they someday can become. Mayor Dinkins. It takes more than tough talk to run a tough city.   ACCURACY Mr. Dinkins has moved to extend branch library service in all five boroughs to six days a week for the first time since 1947, but only after first making deep and bitterly protested cuts in library hours and services in his first 18 months in office to help balance the budget.   SCORECARD This ad, with its soothing soundtrack and soft, sentimental images of an avuncular Mayor, is part of a pointillist campaign that aims to blend dozens of dots into a persuasive pictures, and it does several chores at once. It highlights a small but important accomplishment that the Mayor has managed to make in tough times, one that hits many New Yorkers in their own neighborhoods. It plays to the Mayor's natural warmth and affection for children, which virtually leaps off the screen. It invokes the Mayor's place in history, both by recalling Mr. Dinkins's own diligent rise (he often notes that he was a B student in Latin at his segregated junior high school in Trenton, then led the class at his integrated high school) and his place as a potentially powerful role model for a new generation of children.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"TV Listings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/us/tv-listings.html","abstract":"  On Fridays, television and radio news and listings now appear at the end of section D, with Home Video.

Yet that very success created high expectations that, both supporters and critics agree, Mr. Dinkins has been hard-pressed to fulfill.   The defection of Fire Commissioner Carlos M. Rivera to the Giuliani camp on Tuesday was the latest in a series of bitter blows to a Mayor who had hoped to win credit for making history by naming Mr. Rivera the first Hispanic head of a uniformed service.

In 1963, in a gesture of good will, the French lent Leonardo Da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the next year the Italians sent Michelangelo's \"Pieta\" to town on the occasion of the World's Fair.   Now there's a third visitor that, while not nearly so legendary, deserves to be on this very short list: Andrea del Verrocchio's bronze \"Christ and St. Thomas,\" now at the Metropolitan Museum. The statue was unveiled in Florence in 1483, 15 years after it was commissioned by Lorenzo de' Medici for an exterior niche of Orsanmichele. More than life-size and fresh from five years of conservation work that has restored much of its original patina and many previously obscured details, Verrocchio's sculpture is a technical feat of casting. (If you're interested, the exhibition includes models that illustrate the intricacies of the lost-wax casting process.) More than that, of course, it is one of the high points of the Renaissance drive toward naturalism and emotional truth that would culminate in the art of Verrocchio's student Leonardo, whose own brilliance tended to overshadow his master's. Verrocchio's brilliance is splendidly evident in this astounding work, which Vasari saw as having \"all the grace and divinity that art can convey.\" Do not miss it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Law Helps Communities Evict Bad Neighbors","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/opinion/l-law-helps-communities-evict-bad-neighbors-224993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As a Civil Court judge assigned to the \"drug eviction part,\" I write regarding an Aug. 22 article on efforts by a Bronx church to close alleged drug premises.

Or more accurately, answers, since this unusual group show, sponsored by Independent Curators Inc. and installed in the Courtyard Gallery of the World Financial Center, is very much a collaboration. Komar and Melamid invited 150 artists from the United States, Russia, Canada and Europe to submit proposals for disposing of the thousands of public sculptures in the former Soviet Union that await destruction because their political message is obsolete.

This show places before the viewer nearly 40 Minimalist or proto-Minimalist paintings from the 1950's, 60's and 70's, most of them from the museum's collection. Dominated by canvases in muted shades of gray, olive, blue and white or intractable black, it is nothing if not quiet and serene.   Although somewhat flawed in conception and limited in breadth, \"Singular Dimensions\" offers one of the most extensive surveys of this style in several years. By concentrating on painting instead of sculpture, it emphasizes Minimalism's gentler side, countering the tendency among feminist art historians to see it rather simplistically as a uniformly authoritarian, macho way of art making.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Subway Explosion in Bronx Injures Four","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/nyregion/subway-explosion-in-bronx-injures-four.html","abstract":"  An explosion underneath a subway train in the Bronx yesterday injured four people and delayed trains for two hours, a spokesman for the Transit Authority said.

The team was also cited for failing to notify the league of the allegations. The league's inquiry was prompted by reports that Bruce Firestone, former chairman and co-owner of the Senators, had offered inducements to players to lose their final game against the Boston Bruins so Ottawa would be assured the first pick in last June's entry draft. Although there was some dispute as to what exactly was said, Firestone acknowledged that certain intemperate and inappropriate comments were made regarding the club's performance last season, the league said.

Dinkins overcame years of black-Hispanic political feuding to win two-thirds of the Hispanic vote in 1989, but he is being challenged much more strongly this year. News Analysis. B4.   Mayor Dinkins offered comments that laid the groundwork for a less-than-overwhelming victory in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary. B4.

This revue, created by and starring Bill Irwin and David Shiner, is a far more effective safety valve for urban pressures than drinking two martinis or yelling at a runaway taxi driver. Even before the curtain goes up, Mr. Irwin and Mr. Shiner give us a taste of exactly what can go wrong in a typical night at the theater: Mr. Shiner, by impersonating an obstreperous late arrival who can't find his seat, and Mr. Irwin, by portraying a would-be emcee vanquished by a recalcitrant microphone wire before he can speak a word. Frustration, it becomes clear, is what this production is really about.   For the rest of the performance, with the gleefully eclectic musical accompaniment of the Red Clay Ramblers, Mr. Irwin and Mr. Shiner -- who play off each other in a good-clown, bad-clown tandem -- sustain a highly cathartic interpretation of life as an eternal wrestling match. Car doors, plates of spaghetti, cigarettes and even the performers' own intractable limbs are autonomous forces with daunting powers of their own.

The restaurant reopened with a new owner about two weeks ago, and at this early date, it appears that what was a menu of French food caught in a time warp has been refreshed and reinvigorated without losing its classic roots.   The new chef, Matthew Tivy, 32, whose recent experience has been mostly in brash contemporary restaurants in lower Manhattan, appears to be filling his larder with fine raw materials for French cooking with some inventive grace notes. Among the appetizers ($5.50 to $18.50), a salad of tender warm skate, set on a bed of frisee and perfumed with basil ($8.50), had slivers of jicama for texture. Escargots suitably bolstered with ample garlic were tossed with cream and toasted pine nuts over angel hair pasta ($10.50), and the smooth spinach soup ($6) matched the delicacy of the oysters afloat in it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930903","headline":"Don James Finds That Roses Outnumber the Thorns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/03/sports/college-football-don-james-finds-that-roses-outnumber-the-thorns.html","abstract":"  The former coach will arrive by yacht.

The cafe, three months old, has overcome its initial confusion. It is now turning out a marvelous array of mostly seafood dishes, with Thai and Southwestern touches, at prices that, if not exactly at sea level, don't wander too far up the mizzenmast. Aside from the menu, there's not a whole lot to distinguish the new cafe from the larger restaurant, now restricted to the back room and separated from the front by a long, burnished bar. They share the same entrance, the same kitchen headed by Gary Robbins and overseen by Alfred Portale, the same staff and the same phone number, making it incumbent upon the diner to specify the cafe when calling for a reservation or walking in off the street. They even share the same decor, walls of aqua, gray and white rectangular panels back-lighted to give the feel of a set for a 1950's television talk show, although Dave Garroway and the chimp are missing. The only other difference I could detect in the cafe was the fabric covers with Picassoesque designs slipped over the back of the plain but comfortable chairs. Despite the new sense of energy in the front room, the clientele is basically buttoned down and quiet, competing with the background music of light rock rather than with one another to be heard.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930903","time":"1993-09-03

But even he can't help smiling at the band's music, a gentle updating of age-old traditions.   It is music that plinks and shimmers, set in motion by patterns derived from the traditional music played on mbiras (thumb pianos) by Zimbabwe's Shona people. In some of Mr. Mapfumo's songs, two mbiras generate light, interlocking motifs, in six-beat meters that sound like a music box; in others, electric guitars play similar lines, sometimes over rhythms akin to soca and reggae.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Weicker Calls Special Session Over Patriots","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/nyregion/weicker-calls-special-session-over-patriots.html","abstract":"  Gov.

Mr. Menem points out, rightly, that he is a Peronist with a difference. Where Juan Peron nationalized, Carlos Menem privatizes.

There is no question that asbestos inhaled over a long period in significant quantities can cause cancer or lung disease. But the health risks posed by a few days, or even months, of attendance in schools with asbestos where the exposure could be limited are negligible, they said -- less than the statistical likelihood of developing AIDS or being killed by a mugger, a drunken driver or a bolt of lightning. Indeed, the dangers to children while playing in the streets while out of school are probably greater than the risks of spending a few days in a school while officials establish whether asbestos is present.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Cease-Fire Eroding With Bosnia Talks Stalled","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/world/cease-fire-eroding-with-bosnia-talks-stalled.html","abstract":"  Sarajevo radio reported today that forces of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government battled nationalist Serbian and Croatian militia members in several key regions in fighting aimed at redrawing the map in a proposed peace settlement.

Three wayfarers bounded, darted and wandered through a dark landscape, pausing for bits of activity with lines of fish hanging about the stage and with a large wooden table and chairs, which were put to enjoyable acrobatic use.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Beliefs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/us/beliefs-674093.html","abstract":"  For Stephen L.

He may have been pushed into view a bit early in his career. Mr. Childs can improvise and swing, but his conception never quite seemed authoritative.   It's strange listening to a musician not based in New York. While the best of the young pianists from New York -- Cyrus Chestnut, Stephen Scott, Jacky Terrasson -- have all delved deep into history, Mr. Childs's improvisations were modern in an old-fashioned way, his references predictable. The overt borrowings of the New York school, with its elements of stride, Thelonious Monk, gospel and the 1960's modernists, makes its players unsentimental and rich in narrative; Mr. Childs used one or two colors for most of his show, never really setting up drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Dinkins Agrees to 2 Debates With Democratic Rivals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/nyregion/dinkins-agrees-to-2-debates-with-democratic-rivals.html","abstract":"  Mayor David N.

And I.B.M. is backing a special four-concert Mozart series and a Mozart piano concerto contest.   The idea of corporate support for cultural institutions is new in Eastern Europe and is still treated somewhat gingerly in countries where Communism held sway for so many years. Art is often considered by East Europeans to be sacrosanct and too pure for the incursion of crude commerce. But as a sign of the changes now taking place, Budapest University is offering well-attended courses on the economics of arts institutions, with a heavy emphasis on how to attract private money for culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930904","headline":"Shooting on a Bus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/04/nyregion/shooting-on-a-bus.html","abstract":"  The police were investigating early today a fight that broke out aboard a Transit Authority bus in Manhattan shortly before midnight between two groups of men in which shots were fired inside the bus as it was driven up Broadway through Harlem.

The men, as well as most of the passengers, fled when the bus stopped at 158th Street.

(The odds on finding a match between two unrelated people improve markedly if the two are of the same race or ethnic group.)

It was not an outstanding time. The level of imagination was generally low. Choreographers and dancers know their craft better than ever. But that craft often seemed to be put in the service of well-made dances that took few risks, meandering along on frequently tortuous routes to nowhere. And yet there were a reassuring number of compelling works and performances.    Given the country's increasing preoccupation with social issues, there were surprisingly few dance pieces dealing with such subjects as poverty and prejudice in ways more universal than spontaneous personal response. Dance may have been affected by the general fatigue of the world around it. Only Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's \"Shelter,\" a piece about homelessness that was presented by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center, took an important issue and treated it with formal grandeur. Ms. Zollar, who created the work for her own Urban Bush Women company, approached homelessness from a distance yet with passion, and it worked.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"For Norman Esiason, a Chip Off the Old Block Is Boomer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/nyregion/for-norman-esiason-a-chip-off-the-old-block-is-boomer.html","abstract":"THE New York Jets preseason practice field at Hofstra University was rung by Long Islanders watching the men running, throwing, catching and kicking on the greensward.

After an arduous journey of two years, they reached the \"Forbidden City\" of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet and the home of its incarnated God-King, the Dalai Lama. Once there, they stayed on for five remarkable years, first as tolerated refugees, then as trusted officials in the Tibetan Government.    One of the men, Heinrich Harrer -- now 81, with a distinguished career as a photojournalist behind him -- recorded his experiences in the now-classic book \"Seven Years in Tibet,\" first published in 1954. Part field report, part diary, it is the study not only of an insular culture but of the author's gradual shift in attitude from skepticism at what he took to be the crudities of a foreign land to a profound sense of respect and finally love.

The question sounds naive today, yet the authors of the eight essays in ROME REBORN: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture (Library of Congress/Yale University, $55) argue persuasively that the Vatican Library restored the splendor of Rome. The collection was the torch by which the Renaissance papacy guided itself, and its culture, out of the Dark Ages. The library allowed popes to \"place knowledge systematically at the service of governance.\" The essayists in \"Rome Reborn\" present the vast range of the library's holdings -- from astronomy and philosophy to medicine and cartography -- and describe how the collection expanded. Particularly engaging are an essay on music and the papal choir by Richard Sherr, who teaches music at Smith College, and an essay on the Vatican's Oriental collection by Howard L. Goodman, who teaches East Asian studies at Harvard. Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton who edited \"Rome Reborn,\" contributes a fascinating study, \"The Ancient City Restored: Archeology, Ecclesiastical History and Egyptology,\" detailing how the library influenced the physical transformation of the city. The volume includes more than 200 color illustrations, including beautiful reproductions from editions of Virgil, Euclid and Aristotle. Despite some unevenness in the essays, \"Rome Reborn\" is successful; even when the essays falter, the collection speaks for itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Alice Cornish and Christopher White","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/weddings-alice-cornish-and-christopher-white.html","abstract":"  Alice Lynn Cornish, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Albert E.

A visiting American writer once groused that it made him feel claustrophobic, but Jerusalemites, non-Jews as well as Jews, would find his complaint strange. True, most shops and restaurants close (although not nearly as many as a few years ago) and sometimes this causes inconvenience. But in a city of palpable tension and permanent strife, the enforced quiet of the Sabbath is a spiritual and social massage for a weary body politic, a gift beyond price.   A succession of Jewish holy days, starting with the New Year, Rosh ha-Shanah, on the evening of Sept. 15, will provide the equivalent of many Sabbaths for a month. Most extraordinary is Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Sept. 25 this year, when local custom dictates that even non-observant Jews leave their cars at home, giving pedestrians and children on bicycles full control of deserted streets. The holy period ends with the long festival of Succoth, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/nyregion/westchester-guide-346094.html","abstract":"  KENNEL CLUB DOG SHOW   Picture it: More than 2,300 dogs, all purebred, putting their best paws forward at Lyndhurst in Tarrytown next weekend in the 76th Annual Westchester Kennel Club Dog Show.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"RELIGIONS ENDORSE PEACEFUL PATHS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/us/religions-endorse-peaceful-paths.html","abstract":"  After a week of colorful and sometimes divisive events, an assembly of religious leaders from around the world closed this evening with an appeal from the Dalai Lama for religious peace.

Anglers are not. Sooner or later, knees stiffen, backs tighten, eyesight blurs and bodies succumb to the illnesses and accidents that bedevil us all and the short slopes that separate bank from stream become impassable obstacles for disabled and elderly. Joan Stoliar, who has long been the Den Mother to New York fly-fishers, decided something had to be done. She could not, of course, alter the mortality side of the equation but she felt we all could make it easier for less able anglers to get to the fishing. The result of Stoliar's resolution has been Project Access, the nation's first attempt at providing the disabled with access to public fishing streams.   The Project Access sites, on the Beaverkill, are marked by a simple wood sign reading \"Access.\" \"The whole idea is to bring disabled and able-bodied anglers together, not to segregate them,\" Stoliar explained as she reflected on the catalyst for the project. \"Dave Olesan is a good friend from Theodore Gordon Flyfishers who happens to need crutches to get around. He loves to fish and I love to fish with him and there was no place where we could fish together on the Beaverkill.

Last night, on the shadowy Grandstand Court, Chang shook off a familiar physical aberration, leg cramps, and implacably stroked his way out of trouble against a familiar adversary whose bullwhip serve and hatchet forehand had held him at bay and kept him there in all three previous meetings. While Bernd Karbacher of Germany was busy blinking in the uneven Grandstand spotlights and complaining about the noise from the national anthem on the neighboring Stadium, Chang was busily carving out a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 comeback.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"A Charismatic Fellowship","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/books/a-charismatic-fellowship.html","abstract":"THE FIRST JESUITS\nBy John W.

The aprons, with their dangling yards of stringlike ties, are baffling to many when seen on a store hanger. But some women were not put off. Among the designers who put the apron back in style are Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, both from Belgium. The strings create a high or low waist and often crisscross in back over T-shirts, tailored blouses, turtleneck sweaters or leotards. Polly Mellen, center, the creative director of Allure magazine, wore her checked apron as a midcalf wraparound dress teamed with a white T-shirt. Other women topped slim, ankle-length skirts with different lengths of wraparound aprons. One of the most popular was a black apron that young women wore in the evening. The dresses provide a sophisticated counterpoint to 70's revivalism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"Dresden Bombing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/travel/l-dresden-bombing-070493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: My impression of Dresden was quite different from Bernice Rothschild's (Letters to the Editor, Aug. 15).

Musical innovations generally originate in America, and in particular from black music (rhythm-and-blues and soul in the 50's and 60's, funk and disco in the 70's, rap and house in the 80's). But usually it's British bands that respond quickest to black American innovations, adding a vital element of art-school conceptualism, style and attitude, then promptly selling this repackaged black American music to white America.

The Beekman Theater    Q. Who was the architect of the Beekman Theater, on the East Side of Second Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets? It is similar to the 1952 Manhattan House across the street, designed by Mayer & Whittlesey and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. . . . Thomas Mellins, Robert A.M. Stern, Architects, Manhattan.    A. Like Manhattan House, the two-story-high store, theater and bank building was built in 1952 by the New York Life Insurance Company. But its architects were Fellheimer & Wagner, often identified with bank design.   New York Life apparently decided on a low-rise development it to protect its investment in the apartment house across the street; the company also bought the entire northerly blockfront and key parts of the blockfronts on the west and south.  161 West 75th Street    Q. My apartment house at 161 West 75th Street, like a number of others on the Upper West Side, has two intertwined initials over the door, an \"A\" and something else. Whose initials? And was it the architect or developer? . . . Ivan Berger, Manhattan.    A. Your building was built in 1924 to 1926 by Anthony Paterno -- they are his initials -- and was designed by Rosario Candela. Paterno was one of four brothers, all developers, who generally worked separately. Other brothers also used their initials on buildings they put up.   Joseph Paterno's architect on 905 West End Avenue, at 104th Street, designed an elaborate cartouche with \"JP\" over the door and annotated the 1917 drawing, \"Architect is to approve the plaster model of this ornament before execution.\" Other developers, like the Halls, the Campagnas and the Crystals, also left such traces of their ownership.    I have never seen written accounts of this practice by developers, but after the turn of the century the architectural press often urged architects to \"sign\" their creations. However, only a few architects, usually designers of speculative apartment houses, regularly did this.   The Paternos started building modest walk-ups around 1900 but by the 1920's had become one of New York's reigning builder-families. Joseph Paterno built buildings like 1220 Park Avenue, at 95th Street, and 30 Sutton Place, at 58th Street; Charles put up luxury apartments as well as Hudson View Gardens and Castle Village, north of the George Washington Bridge; Michael built 775 Park Avenue, at 72d Street, and 2 East 67th Street, and Anthony built 1040 Fifth Avenue, at 85th Street.   Generally the Paternos' legible presence on their buildings decreased as their product ascended the economic ladder. On Michael Paterno's 1105 Park Avenue, built in 1922 at the corner of 89th Street, there is only the letter \"P\" and even such modest inscriptions largely vanished on their top-grade buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues. This is consistent with the development in the 1910's of a general upper-class preference for apartment houses known by their street addresses rather than by a name.  126 East 24th Street    Q. In 1945 the real estate broker Charles H. Voorhees had dinner at my apartment at 126 East 24th Street. Mr. Voorhees said that as a child he had attended a French school in the same building and that it was converted to apartments only later. Was he right? . . . Kathryn Guyler, Manhattan.    A. Yes. What is now a single structure at 126 East 24th Street was originally built as a string of four-story rowhouses in 1847 by Lawson Carter, a lawyer. They were at first occupied as private houses, but in 1856 Elie Charlier moved his \"French and English Institute for Young Gentlemen\" to at least one of the buildings.    Voorhees was born about 1860 so he could have attended the Charlier school, which accepted boys at age 7. In 1875 Charlier moved up to Central Park South between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and the Carter family hired the architects Renwick & Sands to add a floor and change the building into modest apartments.   Frances Nightingale lived there from 1904 to 1909, just as she was establishing what became the Nightingale-Bamford School. In 1939 the architect Samuel Lichtenstein modernized the ground floor and the building now has a definite tripartite effect from three different eras -- a Moderne ground floor, the original Italianate middle section and a top section with an elaborate Victorian brick cornice.  3 East 81st Street    Q. There is an interesting building (very tiny) wedged just behind 998 Fifth Avenue. Could this have been an old carriage house? . . . Sylvia Steinbrock, Manhattan.    A. The first building at 3 East 81st Street was one of a row of brownstones completed in 1879. In 1908 the actress Maxine Elliott bought the house and had the architects Hunt & Hunt redesign it with a limestone front. She occupied it with a cousin and five servants. Miss Elliott's obituary in The New York Times in 1940 described her as \"one of America's most noted actresses,\" with a 30-year career beginning with her debut in 1890.    She retired around 1920 and moved to France.   In 1928 she sold the house to the owner of 998 Fifth Avenue, the apartment building at the corner. The house was then demolished but the first-floor facade was retained with a garden behind, apparently as a light protector for the larger building. This structure, with Maxine Elliott's doorway, is what survives on the site. 910 Fifth Avenue    Q. Is it true that the white brick apartment house at 910 Fifth Avenue at 72d Street is really an older structure? The ceilings are pretty high for a postwar building. . . . John Foreman, Halstead Property Company, Manhattan.    A. You're right. Another giveaway clue is the surviving trace of limestone on the easterly lot line wall, toward Madison Avenue. In 1920 the developer Fred F. French put up a limestone-front apartment house of simplexes and duplexes of up to 18 rooms with a sheltered driveway. In 1955 the architects Sylvan and Robert Bien filed plans to add four new floors and rebuild the interior according to \"new concepts of space utilization\" as The New York Times put it in 1959.   These concepts meant apartments of three and a half to eight rooms renting for $500 to $1,415 a month. Robert Bien, now a partner at Eggers & Higgins, says changes in window patterns required the changes in the facade, which would have been done anyway.   \"In those days,\" he said, \"we wanted it to look like a new building, adding that \"white glazed brick was the most expensive, and the most elegant\" material available in the industry at the time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"The City's Rewards","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/style/evening-hours-the-city-s-rewards.html","abstract":"  Some unplanned pyrotechnics at the Met, a waterside still life, smiles from a birthday boy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930905","headline":"The Men Who Would Beat O'Rourke","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/nyregion/the-men-who-would-beat-o-rourke.html","abstract":"  ALMOST every weekday morning, Andrew J.

Every day, we could see her getting stronger, gaining more confidence, growing more and more independent, glorying in her ability to do easily what her parents couldn't do at all.   Our expedition began with a 9.5-mile hike from the top of the Grand Canyon to the bottom.
