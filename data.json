The monolithic core that once dominated exile politics is splintering, and moderates are emerging as a vital new force among Cuban-Americans. Convinced that Mr. Castro's fall is imminent, exiles here have plunged into an impassioned debate over how to bring down his 34-year dictatorship without inflicting further hardship on Cuba's 11 million people.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931006","headline":"Rams' Henley Gets a Leave of Absence","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/06/sports/sports-people-football-rams-henley-gets-a-leave-of-absence.html","abstract":"  Los Angeles Rams starting cornerback DARRYL HENLEY, reportedly under Federal investigation for his alleged role in a cocaine-distribution ring, has been granted an indefinite leave of absence from the team.

Their claims ought to be heard with more sensitivity than they often get now. But increased sensitivity is possible without making gender a special category for asylum. In this area of refugee protection, the U.S. might well look to Canada, which offers a reasonable model.    The U.S., like many other countries, has adopted internationally recognized standards for extending asylum to foreigners. Those standards cover people who were persecuted in their homelands because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinions. Persecution based on gender can be considered within these categories without carving out a new one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931006","headline":"Office Towers in 42d St. Project May Be Getting Taller","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/06/nyregion/office-towers-in-42d-st-project-may-be-getting-taller.html","abstract":"  While public attention has focused on an interim plan to rehabilitate 42d Street with honky-tonk flourishes, New York State officials have also been considering changes to the longer-term redevelopment plan that could lead to office towers far taller than previously envisioned.

The rotation gave the revolution the club staged over the second half in the N.L. West its momentum. It's deep and often unmerciful, paid multi-millions to allow as close to nothing as possible.

Greg Maddux should win his second straight Cy Young Award, Tom Glavine won 20 games for the third straight season and Steve Avery has the most sinister stuff of all of them. John Smoltz, the man with all the pitches and all too often the habit of wasting a great part of his talent, is a post-season deity in Atlanta. He seems to find his zone when the October moonlight finds him on the mound. Avery split his season record against the Phillies, his e.r.a. a full half a point higher versus Philadelphia than it was for the season. He will also be facing the club's right-handed lineup, certainly its more lethal incarnation. Maddux simply is the best pitcher in baseball at the moment. He walks no one, gives up a hit every five innings or so and always takes his club deep into games. Glavine, who has a mixed post-season resume at best, may enter the scene with the most to personally prove. The bullpen, as almost virtually all in baseball are, is ordinary. Mark Wohlers throws hard, but straight, and so is turning around a lot on the mound. Kent Mercker never seems to throw strikes when he has to. Steve Bedrosian and Jay Howell have been effective surprises. But the Braves have not won the World Series the last two seasons because they never seemed able to get the final out. Greg McMichael, barely invited to spring training, gets the invitation to make history for the Braves as the club's closer. But the right-hander, whose out pitches are not strikes, has been awfully suspect after a summer-long run of fantasy finishes. The Phillies, who have faced McMichael six tmes in 1993, stuck him with an 8.53 e.r.a. At Least They're Healthy Conventional wisdom says the Phillies are at the wrong end of a mismatch in this department. As usual, there's considerable truth to standard thinking. The club's starters, a revelation over the first half, were often wounded and worked over across the team's uneven trek to October's promised land. Tommy Greene has been hurt, and Terry Mulholland was once feared done for the season. All are now available and certainly capable. They may have to be much more. Their track record, though, says the corps, one augmented Danny Jackson's left-handed presence, will give the Phillies innings, keep them close enough for there to be hope that the offensive engine will wear down the opposition. Certainly, turning the games over to the bullpen will be a mortifying option. The contingent of relievers, one the front office sought all season to improve and alter, was ranked 11th in the N.L. They together amassed 24 blown saves. The Phillies, not surprisingly, were a marginal 23-20 in one-run games. Mitch Williams, the theoretical closer, is the perfect top man for a below average bullpen. His final pitching line of the season about captured the perpetually potential downside to his dramatics: 1 IP, 1 hit, 2 runs, 2 walks, 2 wild pitches. Advantage Braves IN THE FIELD Sometimes Vulnerable You don't win three straight division titles without a line of defense, and the fielding fortifications for the Braves got more imposing when McGriff was added. His bat gets people's attention and headlines and it might have got him more than a handful of MVP votes (McGriff's arrival sparked the inflation of everyone's averageinfalted the averages of his cohorts at the chop shop, but his play aty first might get the Braves an extra out or two when it counts most this series. But Atlanta, whose overall fielding efforts ranked third in the N.L., isn't without its departments of defense that trouble Manager Bobby Cox. Terry Pendleton, garnerer of Gold Gloves, has been erratic this season at third. Ron Gant, for all his speed and hustle, still can seem unrefined three years after his conversion to an outfielder. David Justice can launch the odd throw that looks more like one of his home runs. And the defense's vulnerability was on full and painful display over the season's final stretch. Freddy Krueger With a Glove It can be Nightmare on Broad Street when the Phillies slip into their slapstick routine in the field. It can happen anytime with this club, and there won't be a worse time than if the Phillies don't make the routine and remarkable plays in October that win championships. Dave Hollins is the first baseman of the future, only he now plays third base in the present. He doesn't do it soundly. John Kruk, the man who does play first, hasn't of late played it nearly as efficiently and airtightly as he had earlier in the season. The club turned the fewest number of double plays of any club in the N.L. in 1993. It also made 141 errors, their defense finding its rightfully mediocre place in the second tier of the league (9th place.) Pete Incaviglia, the man with the World's Gym upper body and world's worst set of wheels, can be an adventure in left. Lenny Dykstra still runs into walls in cnter, but doesn't pick himself up with the ball in his glove quite as often. Advantage Braves. AT THE PLATE Well-Balanced and Hot \"There are good lineups at the plate - Texas, San Francisco, Philadelphia,\" said Ron Gant, the left-fielder for the Braves. \"None are hot like we are hot.\" The temperature turned out these numbers - Atlanta's 169 homers led the N.L. and Gant, David Justice and Fred McGriff all hit 30 or more homers and drove in 100 or more runs. It's a lineup blessed with fabulous balance - Otis Nixon's basehit bunts and afterburners (his 47 stolen bases were good enough for 3rd in N.L.), Jeff Blauser's hit parade out of the No. 2 hole (182 for a shortstop), Terry Pendleton's decision to go nuts with the bat the last week of the season (the third baseman drove in nine over the final weekend), and Mark Lemke's repeated flair for post-season mass production. The lineup had a perfectly healthy appetitite for the strong-arm offerings of the Phillies, as Justice, Pendleton and McGriff combined to hit .333, with Justice homering three times. Gant, though, could be the wild card. With right-handers Tommy Greene and Curt Schilling coming at the Braves in Game 1 and Game 2, Gant, who hit only .191 against the Phillies, will be under the microscope to see if the breakthrough in the clutch he made throughout the second half of 1993 extends to the second season. They Score in Bunches The club nearly scored 900 runs in 1993, a staggering total that wasn't hurt by the 5.3 runs a game the club scored on average in its 12 games with the Braves. Len Dykstra, who might have been the runaway choice for N.L. MVP in the absence of Barry Bonds, is a machine of offensive menace, on base always and across the plate more than any other player in baseball this season. He's a lifetime .312 hitter against Atlanta. The heart of the order is as patient and muscular as they come - John Kruk (.430 on-base percentage, .316 average), Darren Daulton (105 r.b.i., 117 walks) and Dave Hollins (.330 against left-handers.) And the attack - Philadelphia's club average of .274 trailed only the Giants - has been aided by assorted phenomena - Pete Incaviglia drove in an astonishing 89 runs in only 368 at-bats (the left-fielder hit four homers against Atlanta pitching) and and Kevin Stocker, a minor-league promotion halfway through the season, hit .324 in 70 games. Key questions would involve how fast Daulton's bat still is (the catcher played in 147 games), how a lack of team speed might hurt the club in a short series (the Phillies were next to last in the N.L. in stolen bases), and the ability of players with great numbers but inconclusive track records (Mariano Duncan, Jim Eisenreich) to produce in the passion of post-season. Advantage Phillies. OFF THE BENCH Not Glamorous, But Solid Sid Bream, Rafael Belliard, Bill Pecota. They aren't glamorous names, but they are the estimable backbone of the bench for the Braves. They'll provide professional defense and the occasional quality at bat in a big spot. And the dugout isn't devoid entirely of intriguing mercenaries. Deion Sanders can steal a base and make an impact if asked to start. And Francisco Cabrera, whose 15 minutes of fame might have been among the most intense in baseball history hit .357 with a homer and three r.b.i. against the Phillies this year. Which Ones Are They? It's hard to separate the bench from the regulars. Jim Eisenreich hit .318 as the right-fielder against right-handers and Milt Thompson drove in 44 runs as the left-fielder against right-handers. Pete Incaviglia wreaked havoc against lefties and Wes Chamberlain hit 12 homers and 20 doubles in under 300 at-bats. The bench is deep beyond the platoon, too. Todd Pratt 87 as the backup catcher and pinch-hitter. Rickey Jordan who can homer on half-swings, hit .289. And Kim Batiste can fill the role of home-run threat. Advantage Phillies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931006","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/06/nyregion/c-corrections-617793.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a \"Political Memo\" article on Sunday, about the political effects of the Mollen Commission's investigation of police corruption, referred incorrectly to the aftermath of televised comments by Eric Adams, head of an organization of black police officers.

It will be very hard for the Mayor to hold the narrow lead over his Republican challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, that he has in some polls.

William Jones's comment about \"fascist\" elements in the Giuliani campaign is an example. The Mayor's tepid disavowals opened him to the accusation that these statements were coordinated with his campaign. It is not enough for the Mayor to say mildly that \"I do not agree with every statement made by every supporter.\" As Mayor and candidate, he has been too given to tardiness and half-measures.

Giuliani, dressed in red plaid jacket and discreet gold earrings, facing camera in office setting with warm wood-toned television cabinet in background. At one point, footage is interspersed of Mr. Giuliani in a hard hat and plaid workshirt, talking first with a white construction worker and then a black one at a building site. As she says her final lines, Ms. Giuliani first nods, then shakes her head just a bit. PRODUCER: The Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT: As a journalist, I thought I'd seen everything. I was wrong. I'm Donna, Rudy Giuliani's wife. My husband was called a fascist by a group of ministers endorsing David Dinkins. And while people who support the Mayor are called proud, people who support my husband are called racist. This election shouldn't be about race, it should be about competence. Of course I want people to vote for Rudy Giuliani. But I want them to vote for Rudy because he's the best man for the job, not for any other reason. ACCURACY: In endorsing the Mayor last week, the Rev. William H. Jones, the head of a black Baptist ministers group, said Mr. Dinkins had been unfairly branded a murderer in the death of a Hasidic scholar in Crown Heights and that people who made such charges included fascist \"elements\" that has grown around Mr. Giuliani. But he did not call Mr. Giuliani a fascist. While some Dinkins supporters have said that some white Democrats are backing Mr. Giuliani largely because of his race, Mr. Dinkins has never explicitly ascribed racial motives to them. The Mayor often says that for blacks to vote for a black or Italians to vote for an Italian is an expression of pride, while voting against someone because of his origin constitutes racism. SCORECARD: Mr. Giuliani often contends that Mr. Dinkins is too willing to paint himself as a victim of racial animosities, and this commercial, and a similar one by Mr. Giuliani's running mate for Comptroller, Herman Badillo, argues that Mr. Giuliani is the true victim -- of guilty liberal voters reluctant to oppose a black candidate. Without saying so, it objects that few politicians or pundits find it troubling that more than 90 percent of black voters back Mr. Dinkins, while often bemoaning the fact that barely one quarter of whites support the Mayor. That amounts to a call to arms to Mr. Giuliani's strongest white ethnic backers to support him with pride, and to white liberals to be offended by appeals to guilt and focus on competence instead. It trades on Ms. Giuliani's reputation as a former news anchorwoman for WPIX-TV to make its case in a Checkers meets Diane Sawyer vein, and sorrowful tone as she stands by her man puts a soft edge on a tough message. But the ad also risks seeming disengenuous: While ostensibly saying that race should not be an issue, it actually goes to great lengths to highlight and trade on racially inflammatory remarks.

The small increase wouldn't be very important -- except for the fact that last year's experience is part of a disturbing story that's been unfolding for a decade or more. The proportion of Americans living in poverty -- for a family of four, that means living on less than $14,335 in 1992 -- is now 14.5 percent, which is only slightly lower than it was in the 1960's.

To Garry Wills (\"The Kennedy Imprisonment\"), Kennedy was a compulsive risk taker, obsessed with image and style. To Thomas C.

At the moment, evidence of their influence can be found, quite literally, all over town, in the Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum, in Peter Saul's paintings at the Frumkin Gallery on West 57th Street and in the SoHo shows of the young painter Christian Schumann at Postmasters and the sculptor Daniel Weiner at Germans van Eck.    But enough about influence. A sizable portion of the real thing is now having its say in \"Comic Power,\" a sprawling survey organized by John Carlin and Carlo McCormick, with the assistance of Melissa Rachleff, at Exit Art/The First World, in SoHo. Admittedly, the comics under scrutiny are not, for the most part, the all-American kind that influenced Pop artists like Mr. Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol or the lapsed Abstract Expressionist Philip Guston, although a historical section devoted to newspaper comic strips from 1898 to 1945 includes examples of Chester Gould's \"Dick Tracy\" and George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"Breeders' Cup Countdown Begins","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/sports/horse-racing-notebook-breeders-cup-countdown-begins.html","abstract":"  Belmont Park started its countdown to the Breeders' Cup yesterday when a dozen of the leading contenders for 1993 championships were entered in this weekend's major stakes here, one month before they gather again with all of the horse clans for the main event.

Combat\" and \"Secret Hearts\" (\"I don't care! I'd rather sink -- than call Brad for help!\"), not even his most ardent admirers could have predicted how rich a creative vein he had tapped. Everyone saw at the time -- how could they have seen otherwise? -- the giant pin that was Mr. Lichtenstein's art aimed at the hot-air balloon of Abstract Expressionism. He was regarded as a saboteur and a provocateur, but how far could he go with those big, cartoonish spoofs?   Very far, it turns out. So far, in fact, that the end is still not in sight. What makes the gigantic Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum so particularly remarkable is this almost miraculous sense of unfolding possibilities. Ideas tumble out of his work like circus clowns out of a Volkswagen. By the time you reach the top of the museum's ramp you may well wonder how the same artist who in 1961 was cribbing from an advertisement for Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos to come up with an image of a girl holding a beach ball could have conceived in the 1980's and early 90's vast compositions that seamlessly weave references to Picasso and Magritte, the Futurists and Expressionists, not to say to Mr. Lichtenstein himself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"Review/Film; Waking Up In a Future Of Muscles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/movies/review-film-waking-up-in-a-future-of-muscles.html","abstract":"Typical futuristic action-melodrama.

All three performances (the others are tomorrow and Tuesday) were sold out in advance.   The work, a City Opera commission, opened a world-premiere festival in honor of the company's 50th anniversary, in which three new works are being presented on consecutive evenings. But unless one comes to \"Marilyn\" already obsessed by Monroe's mixture of come-hither glances and childlike behavior; unless one finds her death tragic rather than merely sad, there will be very little in this opera to justify three hours of dutiful attention.

Maxwell's four-hour cinematic re-creation of the battle that was the turning point of the Civil War has a stately tone and meticulous attention to historical detail that make it feel more like an epic documentary than a dramatic film. \"Gettysburg,\" adapted by Mr. Maxwell from Michael Shaara's novel \"The Killer Angels,\" limits itself to the first three days of July 1863, when 150,000 soldiers threw themselves into a battle in which more than a quarter of them became casualties.    Probably no American movie has devoted more time to discussions of battlefield strategy than \"Gettysburg,\" which is a film to warm the cockles of a military tactician's heart. Its battle scenes, which used more than 5,000 Civil War re-enactors surging over the actual site of the original conflict, are impressively choreographed. In their sweep and grandeur, these scenes convey a strong visceral sense of what fighting a war used to be like.

In response to that accident, officials also said they were equipping trains with speedometers and \"black box\" recorders like those on airplanes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931008","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/08/sports/results-plus-628393.html","abstract":"  COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Osborne Gets No. 200  No. 7 Nebraska righted itself after a sluggish first half, getting big plays from its offense and special teams to beat Oklahoma State last night in Stillwater, Okla., and give coach Tom Osborne his 200th victory. Nebraska (5-0 over all, 1-0 in the Big Eight) hasn't lost to the Cowboys since 1961. There was a tie in 1973. The Cornhuskers fell behind by 13-3 in the first half as Oklahoma State (3-2, 0-1) took advantage of good field position and held tailback Calvin Jones in check. Jones and the rest of the offense got going in the second half, when field position swung in the Cornhuskers' favor. When Barron Miles blocked a punt and recovered it in the end zone early in the fourth quarter, Nebraska had the lead for the first time and was on its way.
