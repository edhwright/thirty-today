That's the dismaying finding of a Senate staff report on Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which has lost an astonishing $600 million over the last six years providing medical insurance to nearly half the population of New York State. The report rebuts, in exquisite detail, Empire's claim that its problems are mainly due to unfair practices by commercial competitors and other factors beyond its control.    Empire's managers performed ineptly, the study shows, yet they were lavishly rewarded. Empire's board of directors seemingly slept while the company's fortunes plummeted. The State Insurance Department, led by Superintendent Salvatore Curiale, was ineffective. And an independent audit ordered by the Legislature and performed by Arthur Andersen & Company was not so independent and was fatally flawed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930702","headline":"Review/Film; The Way To Her Heart: Through Her Hair","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/02/movies/review-film-the-way-to-her-heart-through-her-hair.html","abstract":"College girl returns to family farm with goofy boyfriend.

The piece seemed to melt away; Mr. Scott let the balance between the tune's form and improvisation shift, with cascades of drumming overwhelming the piece's borders. Mr. Scott, 24 and immensily gifted, seemed almost impatient with the classicism of the mainstream.   The jazz renaissance of the last decade did away with the notion of difficult music in jazz, and \"Behind the Scenes,\" which owed a bit to the more experimental side of Herbie Hancock and later Hampton Hawes (though Mr. Scott is much more referential than either of them), might have been considered abstract by an audience looking to hear the plain mainstream.

For the American Constitution was written in that hall in 1787, and South Africa today is engaged in one of the most formidable exercises in constitution-making since then.    Like the delegates of 1787, the members of the negotiating forum here are creating a wholly new political system -- creating a country, really.

Ms. Zahn's carefully constructed one-woman tributes to the Broadway songwriters Charles Strouse, Leonard Bernstein and Carolyn Leigh have earned her a reputation as one of New York's most discriminating cabaret performers. In her new show at Michael's Pub, she has branched out to perform an array of standards by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Jule Styne, Rodgers and Hart, Peter Allen, Jerry Herman and others. She is accompanied by Ben Aronov on piano, Chip Jackson on bass and Ron Zito on drums. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. There is a $20 cover charge and a two-drink minimum.  Shocked's Keen Vision    Michelle Shocked, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Ms. Shocked writes wonderful anecdotal folk songs that capture the moment with an acuity that seems offhand. She is also a superb storyteller and entertainer whose mixture of canniness and charm onstage suggest a younger, Texan cousin of Arlo Guthrie. Almost everything she does, from singing Texan swing music (on her album \"Captain Swing\") to adapting traditional folk songs with her own lyrics (on her album \"Arkansas Traveler\") is done with savvy and a real passion for her musical roots. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M. Tickets are $15.  Santiago at the Ballroom    Emilio Santiago, the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-3005. An interpreter, not a songwriter, Mr. Santiago, who comes from Rio de Janeiro, suggests a younger, punchier Brazilian answer to Johnny Mathis. In his New York engagement, he sings more than two dozen modern Brazilian songs arranged for a six-member band, in streamlined pop-samba arrangements that effectively set off his glowing baritone. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11:15 P.M. Tickets are $20 and $25, with a two-drink minimum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930702","headline":"Teamsters Officials Face Extortion Charges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/02/nyregion/teamsters-officials-face-extortion-charges.html","abstract":"  Federal prosecutors announced racketeering and extortion charges yesterday against five current and former Teamsters officials.

Ms. Horn, who is 48, about the same age as Anselm Kiefer and other German Neo-Expressionists, is a regular in the big international art shows like Documenta, the Venice Biennale and the Carnegie International, where she won the 1988 Carnegie Prize for an installation work titled \"The Hyra Forest/Performing: Oscar Wilde.\" The year before, at an exhibition of site-specific sculpture organized in and around Munster, Germany (near Cologne), she took over the ruin of a medieval dungeon that might have served the Gestapo, and used small lights and mechanized hammers to convey the unsettling suggestion that the structure still held prisoners trying to chip their way to freedom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930702","headline":"Pentagon Pinocchios","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/02/opinion/pentagon-pinocchios.html","abstract":"  The 1980's were the go-go years at the Pentagon, and that meant anything goes, including lying to Congress.

Retirees under these other plans pay income tax on the part of their benefit that exceeds what they paid in.

Of the four operas by Richard Strauss presented here, \"Salome\" and \"Der Rosenkavalier\" are masterpieces from the composer's heyday, and \"Capriccio\" and \"Daphne\" are lesser-known but musically undiminished works from the dusk of a 70-year career. The balance of early and late, famous and obscure, show the breadth of the composer's achievement.   Strauss's works after \"Der Rosenkavalier\" should no longer be dismissed as instances of stylistic confusion or regression. His loose manipulations of tonality, his experiments with \"real life\" opera and erudite eclecticism, now seem ahead of their time, not behind it.

Murphy's challenge to pending Federal family preservation legislation (Op-Ed, June 19) masks an insensitive assault on poor families who struggle to contend with inadequate housing, insufficient employment opportunities and the unavailability of decent child care. As Mr. Murphy has done repeatedly in Illinois, he argues from a handful of horror stories about families who have brutalized their children, concluding that family preservation dollars spent on parents charged with neglecting or abusing their children is wasted money.   Yet Mr. Murphy's tales bear little resemblance to the vast majority of families who face state intervention based on charges that they have failed to take proper care of their children. Most of the parents who populate the halls of our country's juvenile courts are not child abusers, but individuals who have been charged with \"inadequate supervision\" or \"environmental neglect,\" and who have fallen short of society's high standards in their struggle to feed, clothe and house their families on pitifully inadequate resources.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930703","headline":"In Brooklyn, Guarded Optimism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/03/world/in-brooklyn-guarded-optimism.html","abstract":"  Inside the small offices of the Caribbean Air Mail on Church Avenue in Brooklyn, a constant flow of Haitians poured in and lined up yesterday, waiting to wire money to relatives in Haiti.

A key Clinton Administration objective must be to insure that credits do not degenerate into outright gifts. \n\nThere are private sector solutions emerging that may limit the extent to which the Federal Government needs to underwrite the reform process and that make repayment much more likely.

million mark on about 2,400 screens, to small films like \"Jack the Bear,\" which came and went fast this spring, Hollywood has adopted the broad-brush approach to movie distribution. Studios these days prefer to release a film, whether it promises to be a hit or not, on at least 1,000 screens -- a practice known in Hollywood parlance as the wide release. Even if a movie's prospects aren't good, a wide release is deemed more efficient and potentially profitable.   The thinking is basic. \"The studios want bulletproof movies that reach the broadest possible audience, like TV,\" says Laura Ziskin, the producer of \"Pretty Woman,\" \"No Way Out\" and \"The Doctor.\" Most often, though, such films don't last long. According to Mike Kaplan, a producer who has advised the director Robert Altman on release plans for two decades, \"Most movies are gone in two weeks.

The amenities were minimal: no running water, no electricity and only wind for power. Fresh water was available on deck in two large barrels and each of the 16 dudes was issued a 10-inch basin with dipper. All washing was done on deck out of the basin or in the bay.   The three daily meals were plentiful and delicious; we could work or not depending on what one wished to learn about sailing.

She no sooner finishes her autopsy of the criminal than she spots signs of his handiwork on the mutilated body of a dying boy. More fresh corpses with the dead killer's signature are soon stacking up at the morgue, where someone on the doctor's staff is sabotaging her investigation into these bizarre homicides.   The elaborate plot of Ms. Cornwell's fourth novel shows expert engineering, and the lucid descriptions of those forensic procedures that make her story so grimly fascinating are delivered in the authoritative voice you'd expect of someone who has worked in a medical examiner's office and studied at the F.B.I.

It was an old drafty house by a bay, full of camphor-smelling eaves and corners and unexpected doorways, and one foggy afternoon I slunk about the shadowy upstairs picturing myself in the Black Forest. My grandfather had been to the Black Forest, and from his description I envisioned a mossy, Grimm's-fairy-tale sort of place, not so different from the dark upper hall with its peeling fern-colored wallpaper. That afternoon it had taken me an hour to reach the linen closet, which served as a remote Bavarian castle, and by the time I finally arrived after hiking through the hallway I was worn out. When my mother found me recovering by the pillowcases a few minutes later she asked what I'd been doing, and I told her: \"Traveling.\" She seemed to accept this statement at face value and, from that moment on, so did I.   What I discovered from those foggy afternoons was that home can be a wide and varied place, and that a person may be a seasoned traveler without necessarily leaving the backyard. While some believe traveling means going far away -- imagining that a trip to Bangkok is travel while a trip to the park is not -- others recognize that travel, like relaxation, is mostly a state of mind. The wanderer wanders wherever he is. Naturally, the inverse must also be true. Just as some people can't relax, some cannot travel, no matter where they find themselves. Look at the commuter who drives 75 miles a day, then says he hasn't gone anywhere in months. Or the business person who flies to Rome and then never leaves her hotel. And what about the delicate soul who ventures forth only when the weather is clement, the accommodations posh, the sights acclaimed -- is this travel, or resting away from home?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"Miss Kittredge And Mr. Irving","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/style/weddings-miss-kittredge-and-mr-irving.html","abstract":"  Deborah Whittier Kittredge, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert B.

Even though the musical ran more than two years on Broadway, it never seized hot-ticket status. It has no hit songs, no identifiable logos on T-shirts or marquees and no message of uplift, only one that informs us, assaultively and instantly: \"Time is running out.\" The final ensemble concedes that \"life goes on.\" Worse yet, the show violates a couple of basic precepts of restaurant and theater management. Trips to the restrooms and additional sales of beverages are curtailed because there is no intermission. It's no wonder that, in parody, the name of this show is \"Grim Hotel.\"    All of which makes the Westchester Broadway Theater production a triumph of artistry over commercialism. With Niki Harris and Kenneth Tosti's graceful, faithful, just-so re-creations of Tommy Tune's original nonstop movement (direction and choreography are one), the musical is fluidly accommodated to a boxy thrust stage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"The View From: Tarrytown;\nClass of '43 Has Its Prom Half a Century Later","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/nyregion/the-view-from-tarrytown-class-of-43-has-its-prom-half-a-century.html","abstract":"THIS is what the class of 1943 of the Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx remembers: \"This Is the Army, Mr. Jones\" on the jukebox, reports of European and Pacific invasions on the radio, 7 A.M. physical education classes to prepare for life in the military.\n\nThis is what they don't remember: making a date for the prom, giving or getting a corsage, dancing till dawn in the gym.

In FRA ANGELICO AT SAN MARCO (Yale University, $60), William Hood, a professor of art history at Oberlin College, explores how the artist's piety was translated into a series of frescoes and an altarpiece that have long been cherished for their rich colors and innocent beauty. Mr. Hood argues that Fra Angelico brilliantly reconciled vastly different artistic influences. Outside of the cloister, the Renaissance was developing in Florence, and with it a host of new artistic techniques. However, Mr. Hood writes, Fra Angelico was constrained by centuries-old Dominican artistic traditions. With the aid of many well-chosen illustrations, more than 100 of which are reproduced in color, Mr. Hood shows how the artist selected, altered and combined various stylistic conventions to create his work. Fra Angelico's isolation from the artistic tumult of Florence gave him a certain independence, Mr. Hood maintains; the artist incorporated only those techniques that furthered his own purposes. With his careful research and vibrant, entertaining prose, Mr. Hood explicates Fra Angelico's paintings so that they seem fresh and luminous, and the reader can view the frescoes as vehicles for spiritual transformation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"Crocodile Tears","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/sports/l-crocodile-tears-478993.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   I wept when I read John Ed Anthony's reasons for putting down Prairie Bayou after the Belmont Stakes (\"No Answer for a Broken Leg; No Solace for a Broken Heart,\" The Times, June 27).

The new crescent-shaped, $157 million terminal has six gates, four restaurant-bars, 14 shops and a children's play area. The two-level design reduces passenger congestion by separating arriving and departing passengers. A computerized luggage dispatching system, which identifies baggage with bar codes, synchronizes baggage loading with passenger boarding.

You can be a traveler in Paris -- that most touristy of cities -- if somehow you break through the surface of the cafe and get invited for Sunday dinner with your waiter's family. The distinction has nothing to do with going, as some people have suggested, to a place that can't be found in any guidebook; rather, it implies going without one.\n\nWhich, as we suspected all along, makes the great majority of us tourists. Rare, I think, is the travel writer who doesn't use a guidebook, and even rarer is the travel writer who admits that he does. An exception is the English journalist Richard West who, looking for a place to stay in Granada, Nicaragua, in the mid-1980's (\"Hurricane in Nicaragua: A Journey in Search of Revolution\"), turned to the \"South American Handbook,\" \"that legendary guide that every serious traveler, including Graham Greene, carries about with him in this part of the world.\" The Travelers World Guide series editors reciprocated in their \"Mexico and Central American Handbook\" by noting that Belize City's Old Louisville Democratic Bar was recommended by Mr. West. But most writers give the impression that they are above the mundane concerns of cheap hotels and are traveling in an altogether higher, and more trailblazing, sphere. If they mention books at all, they are usually novels, the more incongruous the setting the better. Greene, in this part of the world, talked not of handbooks but of Trollope.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"Bavarian Fete","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/travel/l-bavarian-fete-780293.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Olivier Bernier's article on Landshut in Bavaria (\"A German Town's Past Is Gemutlich and Gothic,\" June 13) did not mention one of the town's past moments, which makes it even more gemutlich, Gothic and interesting to visit this summer.

Schrader, who started last in the 41-car field, got to the lead on Lap 51 of the 160-lap race and battled at or near the front the rest of the 400-mile event. But Earnhardt, seeking his sixth Nascar Winston Cup championship, controlled the race, leading more than half the laps. Earnhardt, who took the lead for the final time on Lap 132, was just ahead of Schrader, with Marlin close behind him, at the start of the final trip around the 2 1/2-mile oval. As the leaders drove off Turn 2 and onto the backstretch, Schrader went to the high side and tried to get past the leader, but Earnhardt's car was loose and the two banged together, giving Marlin a chance to move up alongside Schrader. That's the way it finished, with Earnhardt's Chevrolet Lumina crossing the finish line about two car lengths ahead and Marlin's Ford Thunderbird just in front of Schrader's Chevy.

Moon was bleeding from a deep cut near his right eye, and the referee checked him and allowed him to continue. Two judges scored the fight for Moon, 116-111 and 116-112. Another gave it to Salazar, 115-114. (AP) GOLF Price Still in Control Nick Price retained a two-shot lead in the Western Open at Lemont, Ill., after the day-late second-round finishers posted their scores yesterday morning. Price had a 135 total, nine under par, after a 71 on Friday. Greg Norman, four times a runner-up in this event, gained a share of second place after 36 holes, but Grant Waite's bid collapsed under a final-hole double bogey. Norman and Waite, a New Zealander and a recent winner of the Kemper Open in Maryland, were among the 51 players who were stranded by darkness Friday night after second-round play was interrupted by a 3 3/4-hour storm delay. They marked their positions and returned to the still-wet Dubsdread course at Cog Hill shortly after daylight to complete their rounds. Waite, who had three holes to play, was eight under par for the tournament and was only one back of Price's 36-hole pace. Waite, however, bogeyed his first hole, the 16th, and chopped up the 18th. He missed the green, chipped well short of the pin and three-putted for a double bogey. That finished off a 71 and dropped him back to 139, four off the pace going into third-round play this afternoon. Norman was seven under par with two holes to play when he returned, and he parred in for a bogey-free 68 that tied him for second at 137. \"I played solid, but I'm not making the putts I'd like,\" said Norman, who didn't make a putt longer than 10 feet. Half his four birdies came on par-5's which he reached in two. \"The course is squishy,\" he said, \"and the greens could be bad by the end of the third round.\" They could be much more squishy by that time.

Skirts for men surfaced as a far-fetched idea in the 70's, when most wearers lacked the brawn to carry it off.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"Venturing Uptown","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/style/evening-hours-venturing-uptown.html","abstract":"  A young downtown crowd traveled north on June 24 for the unveiling of \"Visionaire,\" a portrait portfolio, at Stubbs Books and Prints, 153 East 70th Street.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"Indurain Sends Tour A Message In a Hurry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/sports/cycling-indurain-sends-tour-a-message-in-a-hurry.html","abstract":"  Nobody said it would be easy to beat Miguel Indurain in the Tour de France.

Doesn't the law also state that the landlord must make a timely request to collect the $5 or, in effect, waives his right to do so later? . . . Eugene A. Petrik, Queens Answer: Not really, according to Lou J. Ganim, a spokesman for the state's Department of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, which oversees rent regulation in the city. He said that as long as the landlord had been diligent in making inspections and notifications when he learned of an air-conditioner subject to the $5 fee, no set time deadline existed for the billing, provided the length of time that had passed was reasonable.   \"Something like two and a half years would be considered not reasonable,\" he said. Payment for Moving Question: I am a renter in a noneviction conversion co-op. My landlord is offering to pay me to move out of my rent-stabilized apartment. The purpose of the money would be to cover my moving costs. Any excess I would apply to a down payment on a condo in another state.   Would this money be taxable by the Internal Revenue Service since it is not a gift and I plan to use any excess toward a first-time mortgage? . . . Evelyn Laurie, Brooklyn Answer: Yes. According to Ed Gurea, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service in Manhattan, payments received by a tenant for the cancellation or sale of the lease are treated as the sale or exchange of a capital asset.    He added that if the lease was for the tenant's home the gain would be taxed as a capital gain but that any loss would not be deductible.   Further information, he said, can be found in the Internal Revenue Service's Publication 544, \"Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets.\" The publication is free and can be obtained by calling (800) 829-3676. Rejection of a Sublessee Question: I own a co-op apartment in Manhattan. In order to sublet my studio, I had to get permission from the board. I explained to the board that the potential sublessee was a college student and that the parents would be financially responsible. After the board received this letter it gave permission to sublet.   Later, comprehensive financial documents were submitted by the parents and they were accepted by the board. An interview was also arranged by the board to meet the student and the parents.   After the meeting, however, the student was declined by the board.   When I spoke to the president of the board about the matter I was told that this person was rejected solely because of the person's status as a college student and for no other reason.   My question is this: Does the co-op board have the right to render a reject decision because the person is a college student? Isn't this an example of illegal discrimination by the board? . . . Alvin B. Olesh, East Hills, L.I. Answer: Maybe. According to Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan lawyer and president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, the vast majority of co-ops can reject a sublessee for any reason or for no reason, unless, of course, some sort of illegal discrimination can be proven.   He added that under section 19a of the New York Civil Rights law, which specifically refers to co-ops, illegal discrimination entails not only race and religion but also lawful occupation, which might cover a college student.   Mr. Luxemburg also said that a case like this showed why he and many other lawyers strongly urged co-op boards not to state the reasons for their rejection of an applicant.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"Goldstein and Cashman in Hall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/sports/sports-people-harness-racing-goldstein-and-cashman-in-hall.html","abstract":"  JOHN CASHMAN JR., president of the Pompano Park, Fla., harness racing track, Castleton Farm and The Red Mile in Lexington, Ky., and publicist JOE GOLDSTEIN will be inducted into the harness racing Hall of Fame in Goshen, N.Y. today.

It required a 2-hour-14-minute struggle -- the second-longest women's final ever played on Center Court -- before Graf finally commanded sufficient poise to smash the final shot, a winning overhead, in a contest she felt convinced she was going to lose once she fell behind, 4-1, in the third set.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930704","headline":"ART;\nHow Physics Is Raised to Metaphysics In a Real Art Ways Show in Hartford","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/nyregion/art-how-physics-is-raised-to-metaphysics-in-a-real-art-ways-show-in.html","abstract":"IF ever an organization has lived up to its acronym it is Real Art Ways in Hartford, known as RAW.

The Irish band's \"Zoo TV\" tour last year was split down the middle, with the newer, eccentric songs followed by the old arena anthems. And with its new album, \"Zooropa\" (Island 314-518-047; CD and cassette), U2 announces there's no turning back: Even more than \"Achtung Baby,\" the lyrics turn inward and the music grows willful, tangled, amorphous. Cynical observers may have thought \"Achtung Baby\" was a calculated attempt to keep up with alternative rock, but \"Zooropa\" proves that U2 is a transformed band: raucous, playful and ready to kick its old habits.

Lester Smith and Orson Grosse were pulled over by Police Officer Michael Dalton and his partner for a routine traffic violation. In the car the police found a loaded 10-millimeter Glock semiautomatic, a $600 gun. Neither man had a permit. Even if one did, the gun is supposed to be transported unloaded, in a locked box in the trunk.   A Brooklyn assistant district attorney, Kyle Reeves, called it a \"stronger than average\" gun case. His first offer to the 21-year-old Mr. Grosse was 1 to 3 years. (The driver of the car disappeared; there is a bench warrant for his arrest.) The prosecutor's final offer was 30 days, again refused. Mr. Grosse probably would have been offered probation, except that illegal guns are such a menace that the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, has implemented a policy of seeking prison time in all gun cases. More Complex Than It Seemed    But this apparently simple case, which went to trial last month, turned out to be not so simple, and its resolution has much to say about the complexities of law enforcement in New York City.

Toss in Robert Stack as Senator Arlen Specter, and before you could say Waco or Amy Fisher, the producers should have been counting their money.   More than a year and a half later, that hasn't happened, and the seriousness of the issue is only the smallest reason why. A bigger reason is that the truth behind the he-said, she-said controversy has remained murky, so any drama that took sides would alienate a large portion of the audience -- something television hates to do.

The documents had been overlooked but well preserved in files for nearly a century and a half.   Historians say the new documents are significant because they show the wide range of Lincoln's early practice in every kind of case, civil and criminal, for clients large and small, who wanted a lawyer with a reputation as a courtroom advocate who could sway juries, cut losses through settlements and invoke legal technicalities to delay or gain an advantage in a difficult case.  Signing for Others    Cullom Davis, the director of the Lincoln Legal Papers, a project in Springfield that is documenting Lincoln's law practice from 1836 to 1861, said the legal documents were preserved primarily because they were not signed by Lincoln.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930704","headline":"HAITIAN MILITARY AND ARISTIDE SIGN PACT TO END CRISIS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/world/haitian-military-and-aristide-sign-pact-to-end-crisis.html","abstract":"  Ending a week of uncertainty and bitter recriminations, Haiti's exiled President and the army commander who ousted him signed an accord yesterday providing for the Rev.

Clad in hard hats and work boots, more than 75 volunteers worked under flawless June skies, from early morning until late afternoon for two days, transforming a pile of wood into a sophisticated playground for children aged 2 through 12.   The scene was Webb Field, adjacent to the Highview School here, and the \"barn raising\" project, as its planners called it, was proceeding without a hitch. The idea was to gather people from the entire town of Greenburgh -- of which this village is a part -- to change a scruffy play area into a first-rate playground like the one that Grace Rapkin, the project leader, saw in Chicago last summer.    \"It was the most phenomenal playground I'd ever seen,\" said Ms. Rapkin, the mother of two small children. \"When I found out that it was a community project, I knew we could do the same thing here. So I got together with my neighbors, and we went to the town's Department of Parks and Recreation.
