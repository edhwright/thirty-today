The violence forced the United States on Tuesday to pull back a troop ship carrying American and Canadian military advisers to Haiti for a United Nations peacekeeping force.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931014","headline":"A Princess Tightens Her High-Fashion Belt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/14/arts/a-princess-tightens-her-high-fashion-belt.html","abstract":"  Two hundred years ago on Oct. 16, Marie-Antoinette was guillotined in Paris.

Sotheby's auction of \"The Thurn und Taxis Princely Collection,\" as the seven-volume boxed catalogue is grandly titled, began today and will continue until Oct. 21.   Marie-Antoinette's death is being remembered in Paris by all manner of nostalgic events, among them a newly composed Requiem Mass and a play in which the audience gets to vote on her fate. By and large, to the chagrin of the play's creators, they are choosing exile or death.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931014","headline":"Moscow Journal; Russia Finally Finds a Free Market, Centuries Old","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/14/world/moscow-journal-russia-finally-finds-a-free-market-centuries-old.html","abstract":"  Moscow was always good at keeping secrets, which is one reason why it took so long for archeologists to start digging around the Kremlin walls, searching for evidence of the city's multi-layered civilization.

Washington Text: (Voiceover) Whitman and Florio. Compare. Christie Whitman wants to cut state spending. Jim Florio increased spending by three billion dollars. Christie Whitman wants to create new jobs with tax cuts. Jim Florio raised taxes billions and he won't rule out raising taxes again. Whitman will clean up state Government. Florio's administration is under two grand jury investigations. Jim Florio. Rising unemployment, corruption, high taxes. We can't afford more. Christie Whitman. A change for the better. Visual: Still photos of Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio appear side by side -- predictably she is smiling engagingly while he is frosty -- while graphics echo the truncated words of the narrator. Her image disappears when the specter of corruption is mentioned, replaced at the Governor's side by stacks of money and news headlines reading \"State Jobless Rate Reaches 7.7 % For Second Rise in a Row\" and \"Lax Ethical Standards.\" Analysis: What's new here is the odor of corruption. In earlier television spots, Mrs. Whitman tried to saddle Mr. Florio with all the bad effects of a prolonged recession while contrasting the $2.8 billion tax increases he pushed through the Legislature in 1980 with her campaign promise to cut taxes by $1.4 billion. (Mrs. Whitman herself refuses to sign a no-new-taxes pledge.) While mention of the two grand juries is fair game, equating them with proof of corruption is not, and Mrs. Whitman's pledge \"to clean up state Government\" not only lacks specifics but means little without evidence that it is dirty. A state grand jury is looking into allegations that $1.5 million in excess state school aid was sent to the Democratic-controlled town of Lyndhurst , which GOP partisans have painted as a political payoff ordered by the Governor's office. Meanwhile, a Federal grand jury has been examining the old practice, unique to neither party, of directing profitable state bond business to Wall Street fat cats who make hefty campaign contributions to the party in power. The fly in Mr. Florio's ointment here is that Joseph C. Salema Jr., his chief of staff and political satrap, was a partner in a bond consulting firm that profited handsomely from state decisions. Mr. Salema resigned last May to spare the Governor further embarrassment, but so far Federal investigators have not indicated that any laws were broken. Some Democrats question whether Mrs. Whitman, whose husband is a wealthy Wall Street broker and whose late father was a Republican power broker and fund-raiser, is all that shocked by back-room deals between Trenton and captains of finance.

Dinkins back on the defensive, Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials and two similar radio ads, harshly attacking the Mayor's record in office and a range of personal or professional lapses dating back two decades. This is one of them. ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with big words on screen \"Maybe we should have known better,\" next to a tiny picture of Mr. Giuliani noting that his campaign paid for it. Followed by pictures of a Comptroller's report, and a quotation from it: \"...serious internal control weaknesses over revenue...\" Then newspaper headlines, title noting that Mr. Dinkins failed to file tax returns from 1969 through 1972, footage of Korean boycott, Crown Heights, asbestos sign on a dumpster, and titles that repeat much of the narration. It ends with a picture of Mr. Dinkins, with a smirky smile, and the words \"It's not my fault.\" Last image: White letters on black background, \"Maybe it was our fault four years ago.\" PRODUCER: Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT:  Male narrator: \"Maybe we should have known better. When David Dinkins was City Clerk, a Comptroller audit found that his office was a financial mess. He also forgot to pay Federal, state and city income taxes four years in a row. You think you'd get away with it? Then he becomes Mayor, and we get the Korean boycott, the Crown Heights riots, the PVB scandal, asbestos in the schools and on top of that, we lose 350,000 jobs. And all David Dinkins says is, it's not my fault. Maybe he's right. Maybe it was our fault four years ago.\" ACCURACY: Two audits by the City Comptroller did fault the management of the City Clerk's office during Mr. Dinkins's tenure from 1975 to 1985. He failed to file income tax returns and pay all taxes due from 1969 through 1972, but he later paid the taxes with penalities and there was no prosecution. As one of the Giuliani radio ads notes, the lapse prevented Mr. Dinkins from becoming the city's first black deputy Mayor in 1973. The school asbestos problem long predated the Mayor's tenure in office, and economists say the city government cannot be held accountable for all the jobs lost in a severe regional recession. Moreover, Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged fault in several of the cases cited, particularly with respect to Crown Heights. SCORECARD: This tough ad attacks Mr. Dinkins for a range of old and new lapses, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink. It is Mr. Giuliani's attempt to counteract the Dinkins ads that have sought to rehash old aspects of his record of service to Republican administrations and link them to his current policy views. Similarly, this ad attempts to paint Mr. Dinkins's entire career as an endless skein of mediocrity and bumbling -- typified by his failure to pay income taxes. The \"You think you'd get away with it?\" line is an indirect echo of a charge the Giuliani camp sometimes makes more overtly: that if Mr. Dinkins were white, he would never have been forgiven such a lapse. That is a way of saying whites need not feel guilty for voting against him now, having given him a break four years ago. By citing the most notable crises of the Dinkins administration, the ad may ring uncomfortably true. But its rapid-fire mix of images and charges, and its final sneering tone of blaming the electorate may also put voters off.<? TODD S.

Now in its fifth year, the seven-day event, which opens today at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, is firmly entrenched in the international collectors' circuit. Falling somewhere between the over-the-top Biennale Internationale des Antiquaires in Paris and the terribly stuffy Grosvenor House Antiques Fair in London, it's the most impressive art and antiques show that New York City gets to see, both in the quality of its contents and the originality of their presentation.   This fair is also the only New York event that collects works as diverse and rare as a suite of 19th-century Russian furniture, a group of Syrian alabaster sculptures dating from the fourth to the third centuries B.C., a Canaletto scene of Venice that once belonged to King Ludwig I of Bavaria and a 19th-century cross of garnet and diamonds. Prices are generally high. While small objects like a nice pair of earrings or a botanical drawing can be had for several thousand dollars, many of the big-ticket items, whether furniture or artifacts, cost up to $1 million.

In particular, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has locked horns recently with the United States on policy for Somalia.  1  NOBEL FOR MANDELA AND DE KLERK    Nelson Mandela and President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa won the Nobel Peace Prize for their quest to end apartheid and to create an interracial democracy.  1  A DELICATE BALANCE IN SOMALIA    The shift from near-war in Mogadishu to an uncertain peace has presented U.S. and U.N. forces with a quandary: how to re-establish a military presence without provoking a return to fighting.  6    Grudgingly, the Senate approved the President's Somalia policy.  6    The U.S. pilot freed in Somalia arrived in Germany.  6  A CANADIAN BOMB PLOT TRIAL    In Canada, five Muslims are on trial for plotting to bomb two sites near Toronto.

Despite the naughty bits, most of the two-hour show is devoted to repositioning Madonna from trend-spotter to part-time nostalgia merchant, and from titillating novelty act to all-round entertainer. With \"Blond Ambition,\" she was pop's least flirtatious sex symbol; in \"The Girlie Show,\" which started its three-night stand at Madison Square Garden on Thursday, she's likable again.

Mario M. Cuomo signed a compact yesterday to let the St. Regis Mohawk Indians open New York State's second high-stakes gambling casino, a $10 million Las Vegas-style operation on a Canadian-border reservation where illegal gambling led to deadly clashes between factions of the tribe in 1990.   The Governor acted after Mohawk leaders agreed to stiff state regulations for running the casino and offered assurances that there would be no return to violence. Three years ago tribe members opposed to illegal gambling blocked roads, attacked businesses and shut down the reservation for five weeks in clashes that escalated into gunfights and left two Mohawks dead. A $6 Billion Bonanza    While some Mohawks still fear an invasion of disruptive neon-lighted businesses and criminal elements and argue that gambling undermines traditional tribal values, many others, citing a long history of poverty and official neglect, welcome a chance to get in on the $6 billion-a-year bonanza that gambling has brought to about 70 Indian tribes in 20 states under a 1988 Federal law.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931016","headline":"Jockey Faked Record","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/sports/sports-people-horse-racing-jockey-faked-record.html","abstract":"  EIBAR COA, the leading rider at Calder Race Course in Miami, was suspended for 60 days by track stewards yesterday amid charges he falsified documentation that permitted him to ride with a five-pound apprentice allowance.

I think of her as a character out of Joseph Mitchell or Meyer Berger, the two writers who formed my early sense of New York as an explorer's world of hidden oddballs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931016","headline":"Wrapping Up 6-Year Inquiry, Iran-Contra Prosecutor Tells of High-Level Cover-Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/us/wrapping-up-6-year-inquiry-iran-contra-prosecutor-tells-of-high-level-cover-up.html","abstract":"  The Iran-contra prosecutor has concluded in his final report on the arms-for-hostages affair that investigators uncovered evidence of a high-level cover-up but discovered it too late to prosecute those involved, people who have read the report said today.

The play follows the drunken progress of a cocktail party, which takes place in the Park Avenue apartment of Clayton Maguire (Dana Vance), a successful television journalist with a career-fracturing secret.

She said she had \"not seen a strong platform\" on women's rights from Mr. Giuliani.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931016","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/nyregion/c-corrections-541393.html","abstract":"  An article on Thursday about United States policy toward Haiti misidentified the home district of Representative Charles B.

Sound familiar? It is. It was down to the wire four years ago too, when David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani debated the terms of the debate for weeks. Ultimately, they held two televised debates -- on the last weekend of the campaign.   Then as now, the same disagreement separated them: who participates. Mr. Giuliani wants to debate the Mayor one on one, while Mr. Dinkins wants George Marlin, of the Conservative and Right to Life parties, included. Obviously Mr. Giuliani doesn't want to lose even one vote to Mr. Marlin, and Mr. Dinkins hopes Mr. Marlin will attract votes that would otherwise go to Mr. Giuliani.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931016","headline":"Rights Monitors Are Pulled Out of Haiti","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/world/rights-monitors-are-pulled-out-of-haiti.html","abstract":"  They came to monitor violations of Haitians' rights, but like their military counterparts, human rights workers sent here by the United Nations and the Organization of American States have decided that the dangers are suddenly too great.
