That left the door open for Stewart and Cochran to force a playoff with birdies on the final hole. But Stewart had a 25-foot birdie putt come up an inch short, and Cochran missed from 40 feet. Each shot 69 yesterday to finish at 282. Standly began play two strokes behind 54-hole leader Greg Kraft. Standly had six birdies, five on the front nine despite rain and wind gusting to 25 miles an hour. His only bogey of the day was on the 11th, but he birdied the 12th and then parred in. Stewart, the 18- and 36-hole leader before falling a stroke behind on Saturday, threatened to play himself out of contention with bogeys on Nos. 4, 5 and 7.

This may make Mr. Greidinger, a 29-year-old staff lawyer with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, appear like the hero David defeating the mighty Goliath, but I think his slingshot was misdirected.  The privacy that needs to be protected is not the Social Security number, but the information in the files that the number helps identify.   It would probably be a good idea if Social Security numbers were generally used and available for identification. They are unique, universal, unambiguous and relatively concise. I do not advocate that we give up our names in favor of numbers, but if an organization has to deal with 10 John Smiths, something more is needed. In the past our local police department promoted Project Theftguard, encouraging people to engrave their driver's license number on household articles to assist in their identification in case of theft. I chose to use my Social Security number as being much more practical.   The problem with privacy is not that Social Security numbers are used for identification, but that the custodians of confidential information have inadequate procedures for releasing that information.    If a name is not sufficient to provide access, neither should a Social Security number be. There are other possibile choices. The most obvious is the use of a brief personal identification number, a system used by banks and bank cards.   There will be situations in which it is not practical to set up an identification system in advance, for example, a request for a birth certificate or a request to a credit bureau for one's record in its files. Each organization must be responsible for setting up adequate procedures for safeguarding and releasing its information.    A Social Security number may be helpful for identification, but it need not and should not be the key that unlocks the door to private information.

A trade of Montana would have a two-fold purpose for the 49ers. First, it would clear the way for Steve Bono, an unrestricted free agent who hasn't announced whether he wants to stay with or leave the 49ers, to be named the backup to Steve Young. And second, it would free up the $2.5 million that Montana is scheduled to earn this year. The 49ers are trying to sign Eagles defensive end Reggie White with an eye to a possible salary cap in 1994 under the National Football League's new rules on free agency.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930405","headline":"Man Is Held In Shooting On East Side","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/05/nyregion/man-is-held-in-shooting-on-east-side.html","abstract":"  A 19-year-old Mount Vernon man was arrested Saturday night after robbing a cabdriver, exchanging gunfire with a police officer, shooting and seriously wounding a motorist in a carjacking and then racing about 15 blocks up the Upper East Side in the wounded man's station wagon in an attempt to escape, the police said.

In short, DOS 6.0 is great for most PC users, especially beginners and casual users. The new utilities do their jobs well. For computer hot-rodders, though, the DOS 6.0 utilities are just training wheels.

Little physical brutality is shown at Bridgewater; maybe the staff was on its best behavior. The cruelty takes the form of verbal bullying by guards and the seeming indifference of doctors.

As she told her story later, Mrs. Voloder broke down in tears. \"Oh help me, please help me,\" she said over and over as she stood in Sarajevo's central market, clutching a bedroll wrapped in plastic and stamped with the blue-and-yellow flag of the European Community. The bedroll was part of a handout of relief supplies to families in Bistrik, and Mrs. Voloder was hoping somebody would buy it for 10 German marks, about $6.50, so that she could buy more food. Sniper Attack on Rally    On Tuesday, this besieged city will mark the first anniversary of the attack that most people regard as the first volley of the brutal war here, a burst of Serbian sniper fire from a third-floor window of the Holiday Inn that killed several people in a crowd demonstrating outside the Bosnian Parliament for peace and national unity. The shots were aimed at destroying a society, just like the gunfire that cut down Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife on June 28, 1914, about a mile from where the Holiday Inn now stands. Those shots set off the train of events that led to World War I. 'The City Is Destroyed'    But the Sarajevo that emerged from World War I and from World War II, when it was occupied by Nazi forces, suffered only mild physical damage in comparison with the cataclysm wrought by the Serbian siege of the last year.
