The immediate plan has the M.T.A.'s go-ahead for everything but the proposed cuts in service, which must go through public hearings. The Transit Authority sensibly seeks the biggest savings from trimming bureaucracy and increasing productivity.

Something in the quality of her tone immediately entrances the ear. There are, however, limitations: she is marvelous in the lower and middle registers, but she has some difficulty toward the top. Here the tone turns less alluring, though never harsh, and there are moments of unsteadiness. In addition, she does not seem to have much expressive range beyond a sort of rapturous melancholy.   Yet what wonderful music she makes within those limitations. Four Brahms lieder -- \"Dein blaues Auge,\" \"Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer,\" \"Auf dem Kirchhofe\" and \"Verzagen\" -- had the proper tone of sad repose, broken at times by piercing anguish. Three famous Tchaikovsky songs -- \"Again, as Before, Alone,\" \"None but the Lonely Heart\" and \"Was I Not a Little Blade of Grass\" -- profited from the singer's plush legato. Songs of Chausson and Duparc, including \"Extase\" and \"L'invitation au voyage,\" were more hesitant, with some wayward French vowels, but caressingly done.

Mr. Rubin would wipe away rules dating back to the Depression that are unsuited for modern financial markets. He would allow banks to join forces with insurance and securities companies, creating a competitive mix that should benefit customers. The plan would, by diversifying investment opportunities, make banks less risky -- the best way to avoid a taxpayer-financed bailout of depositors.

He attacked several Democratic opponents for what he called a \"stunning flipflop\" on a measure they voted for a year ago, and other Republican senators criticized President Clinton's opposition, as well. On Tuesday, Mr. Dole suddenly postponed the vote on the amendment when it became clear that he had just 66 of the 67 votes needed. The decision to have the final vote today came after apparently unsuccessful attempts to reach a compromise that would keep Social Security trust funds off limits to budget cutters. \"There is no reason a balanced budget amendment could not pass with nearly 80 votes in a matter of a few minutes -- if they're willing to protect Social Security,\" said Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat.

At least in the short run, it was a body blow to the Republicans, who took over Congress with pledges to erase the Federal deficit and slice up the old order.   The President's power to eliminate spending items approved by Congress would be enhanced by two bills that a Senate committee approved and sent to the Senate floor, where it faces considerable Democratic opposition. By a 13-to-2 vote, the Governmental Affairs Committee approved a measure that would give the President 20 days to delete a program but says the House and the Senate must approve the proposed rescission within 10 days.

No sooner does the orchestra begin the opening vamp for the song, written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, than the audience roars in affectionate recognition of a tune that is tattooed on the memory of most American adults. But what follows is of a very different ilk from the haunted-sounding version made famous by the Drifters in 1963. The rhythms have been souped up, with a hint of a disco beat.

The ambitious new piece shared the program with an onstage presentation of costumes worn at the Heian court in Japan from 794 to 1185. An exquisite cultural event in itself, the presentation included the methodical dressing of a model, Kaori Sato, in layer upon layer of silk kimonos of increasingly intense pink to red hues, with witty narration by Celeste Holm.   So when the curtain rose on \"The Tale of Genji,\" drawn from the 11th-century novel by Lady Murasaki, it was something of a shock to see a decidedly nontraditional mixed-race cast, in costumes that seemed to have very little to do with what had gone before, performing theater and movement that mixed Western contemporary and Asian traditional styles. The Japanese-born choreographer, now celebrating her 25th year in America, does know her stuff. The blend was seamless and comfortable, as was the score.

But punitive acts against people who need help to survive won't take them there.   Driving people off the rolls and cutting welfare benefits rest on a popular but false assumption that New York is a welfare free-spender. The Mayor and Governor point out that the total spent in New York State on the main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (A.F.D.C.), is greater than what is spent by every other state except California. But that is simply because New York has more poor people eligible for welfare than any other state except California.

The difference is that only one other original member of the Scottish band remains, the guitarist Charlie Burchill.

And he was secretly recording the talks under the direction of investigators for the school system. Page 23.

At 9:58, Ellyn Kusmin, the operations manager for the New York Philharmonic who was maintaining telephone contact with the driver, rang for the elevator and held its door so the visiting Russian director would not lose any seconds as he headed up to the concert hall where 90 musicians were waiting for their rehearsal to begin.

Three blocks from the school, a 31-year-old man had walked onto a narrow parapet 22 floors above Park Avenue South. Clutching a steak knife and leaning precariously out over the street, the man alternately seemed ready to jump or to cut his own throat, the police said. Page 22.

Sherryl Swoopes and Dawn Staley were among those who were to compete for the United States team at the games in Argentina, March 11-27.

(AP) YACHT RACING  Women's Team Wins  Getting a new America's Cup yacht up to speed off San Diego proved to be a formidable task during the America  team's first trials race in Round 4 on Thursday, and the result was a loss to Stars & Stripes. But the mechanical troubles, which skipper Leslie Egnot had termed \"teething problems,\" appeared to subside yesterday as the all-women's crew defeated Young America by 56 seconds. J. J. Isler, starting helmswoman on America  's new boat, Mighty Mary, shrewdly steered the yacht off to the right side of the course when a favorable wind shifted in that direction at the start, and 10 minutes later, Mighty Mary tacked in front of Young America, and was ahead by about six boat lengths. SAILOR, 70, IN TROUBLE: The quiet and relatively uneventful passage through the ice-ridden South Pacific for most of the 13 solo sailors left in the BOC round-the-world yacht race was interrupted late Thursday night by a report that a Class II competitor, Harry Mitchell of England, had sent out a distress signal. Race officials in Charleston, S.C., pinpointed Mitchell's position at 1,450 miles west of Cape Horn.  HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL  Lincoln Routs Clinton  Lincoln routed Clinton, 91-42, in the second round of the Public Schools Athletic League Division A playoffs at Riverbank State Park yesterday. The teams met for the first time in more than 15 years and by halftime -- with the Railsplitters ahead by 45-22 -- they seemed decades apart. Clinton (12-13) could not stop Gerard Hawkins, who had 18 points in the opening half against the Bronx team and finished with a game-high 20. Stephon Marbury added 14 points and 8 assists for Lincoln (21-3), which will play Boys & Girls on Wednesday in an all-Brooklyn quarterfinal.    In yesterday's other second-round game, at Lehman College in the Bronx, Manhattan Center outlasted Newtown, 42-38.

Mr. Wilson was identified by the prosecutor's office as the driver of the car used by the three defendants.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950304","headline":"Mexican Ex-President Starts and Ends a Hunger Strike","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/world/mexican-ex-president-starts-and-ends-a-hunger-strike.html","abstract":"  The political drama that has gripped Mexico since the arrest of a brother of the former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, veered toward farce today as Mr. Salinas went on a hunger strike to rescue his \"honor\" and then suspended it hours later.   Mr. Salinas, who left office three months ago as one of the most powerful Mexican leaders of the last century, told reporters who followed him to a poor neighborhood in the northern city of Monterrey that his protest had nothing to do with the arrest of his brother, Raul, on murder charges.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19950304","time":"1995-03-04
