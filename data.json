The package included round-trip economy-class air transportation between New York and Brussels, Saturday and Sunday night accommodations in the five-star President Hotel World Trade Center, a three-course Saturday night dinner, Sunday brunch, hotel service charges and taxes, buffet breakfasts, and rail transfers between the Brussels airport and the Gare du Nord minutes away from the hotel -- all for $499 double occupancy (or $599 single occupancy). The lowest available round-trip air fare on Sabena between New York and Brussels was $538, which is why I figured that the package might just be a fantasy come true.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Sports of The Times; The Pizza QB Nobody Knows","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-pizza-qb-nobody-knows.html","abstract":"  WITH his roundish face and roundish body, it's as if Spanky in the \"Our Gang\" comedies had grown up to be the Chargers' quarterback.

I first read Angus Wilson when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the late 1950's. Nobody had recommended him: I found him for myself. \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\" had appeared in a Penguin paperback in 1958, and maybe this was the novel that introduced him to me -- or maybe it was a volume of short stories, or his first novel, \"Hemlock and After,\" also available in Penguin. However I came upon him, I rapidly read my way through all that was available, and began to wait eagerly for the next volume. I can remember to this day the sheer physical pleasure of sitting on the flat roof outside my tower room at Newnham College, in the warm sunlight, when I should have been studying for some examination or other, reading Angus Wilson instead and knowing myself to be in the company of a master. When I got to the end of \"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes,\" I wanted to begin reading the book all over again. And I have since read it many times, and always wished it were longer.\n\nThe excitement of discovery had a subversive element. Cambridge in the 1950's was heavily dominated by F. R. Leavis and his Great Tradition: we were more advanced than Oxford, for we were permitted -- indeed enjoined -- to read and admire D. H. Lawrence. But there all curiosity ended. We were not allowed to read on. Leavis's critical presence was so powerful in the university that it killed all but the most stubborn literary talent: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes survived, but many more withered, or took a diversionary leap sideways into drama.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Only Doubt Endures","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/books/only-doubt-endures.html","abstract":"  DEATH IN ROME  By Wolfgang Koeppen.

The most recent example is Dick Armey's reference to Representative Barney Frank, who is openly homosexual, as \"Barney Fag.\" Mr. Armey is the House majority leader, and we would have to go back to the days of Earl Butz to find a parallel example of such common behavior by a high Federal official.   His explanation that this was a \"stumbled word\" instead of \"an intentional personal attack\" is not supported in any way by the tape recording of his interview. He spoke with clear intent to defame a worthy opponent. In place of true contrition, Mr. Armey used a ranting speech on the House floor to denounce reporters for refusing to suppress his disgraceful on-the-record remarks made to interviewers assembled by Mr. Armey's staff with the express purpose of taping his words for broadcast. Even those who argue that Newt Gingrich's mother was sandbagged into criticizing the First Lady cannot defend Mr. Armey. Here was a professional politician speaking in a formal setting with bigotry aforethought.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Dorian Gray Takes to the Opera Stage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/dorian-gray-takes-to-the-opera-stage.html","abstract":"THE dream of living forever without growing old has been woven through oral lore and literature over the centuries.

The deal did not signal an appreciation of the record business by the studio head: Reprise -- even with Mr. Sinatra on its roster -- was a loser. Rather, Warner's studio had recently enjoyed a hit with \"Ocean's 11,\" a Las Vegas caper film featuring the singer and several of his \"rat pack\" buddies, and the purchase of the label was part of a broader deal to tie up Mr. Sinatra as an actor. Even if Reprise continued to lose money, it was a cheap way of assuring that Mr. Sinatra would make movies for the studio -- a potential gold mine for Warner Brothers.   The deal did prove a gold mine, but not because of Frank Sinatra. Reprise gave Warner Brothers the services of a man whose ultimate value to the company over 31 years would dwarf Mr. Sinatra's: Mo Ostin.    At 68, the balding, bespectacled and low-key Mr. Ostin looks more like the controller he is by training than the monumental cultural visionary and business tactician he has proved to be. He stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of Warner Brothers Records on Dec. 31 after losing an unusually public corporate power struggle. But long after the dust of his departure has settled, Mr. Ostin's contribution to the record business will endure. Under his direction, Warner Brothers was transformed from a small, struggling label into the world's largest record company and the financial engine that drove Steve Ross's Warner Communications. Most significant, however, was the way Mr. Ostin achieved the transformation: by embracing the rock underground of the 60's when other, more conservative labels were loath to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"How I Survived Off Off Broadway: One Man's Tale","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/how-i-survived-off-off-broadway-one-man-s-tale.html","abstract":"  WHEN Aunt Chiche went for her checkbook, I thought I had it made.

To conservatives, the family is a hierarchy -- father, mother and cadets -- and the conservative dream is a lifetime within the crystalline bosom of a perfect family, where individual liberty (always a disruptive force) has been sacrificed to familial coherence.

Van Halen, however, is more durable, because even as Sammy Hagar huffs and grunts through lyrics like \"Oh girl, come on/ I want you to take me there,\" the band keeps hurling musical zingers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950129","headline":"Religious Leaders Call for Greater Mutual Understanding","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/nyregion/religious-leaders-call-for-greater-mutual-understanding.html","abstract":"  As the nation's religious diversity becomes more pronounced, religious leaders must seize the opportunity to deepen their own faiths by understanding other traditions.

Companies like Cunard and American Airlines are now lending their familiar emblems to targeted sales brochures.    The International Gay Travel Association now has 1,000 members, 65 percent of them travel agents, in the estimate of David Alport, the group's vice president, who is also the publisher of the gay travel newsletter Out & About. And last year, for the first time, the Gay Travel Association participated in the convention of the American Society of Travel Agents, held in Lisbon.    There is certainly a shakeout, too. Lorry Heverly, an agent in Baton Rouge, who went into business a year ago to serve gay and lesbian clients, said she actually put together one tour herself, a trip to New Orleans at Halloween, when the French Quarter turns into a vast masquerade. The program did not sell well, she said.   Asked about this apparent paradox -- an event that has been a natural sells badly as a package -- Billy Kolber, editor of Out & About, said that a number of companies new in the field assumed that listing a trip as an \"all-gay departure\" for, say, a safari would be enough. But operators and agents have found that this approach does not succeed, he said, because gay clients can be perfectly comfortable on a mainstream safari. At the other end of the spectrum, gay clients may not need a guided tour to an easygoing place like New Orleans or Key West. Tour content and assurances of acceptance in areas where gay couples may have been shunned are apparently better selling points.   The owners of Out & About, who say it has a circulation of 6,500, believe that much of the agent interest stems from a need to find loyal clients in hard times. \"Travel agents are delighted to find that this underserved community is so loyal,\" Mr. Kolber said. Out & About is published 10 times a year and a subscription costs $49 in the United States: 8 West 19th Street, Suite 401, New York, N.Y. 10011; (800) 929-2268 or (212) 645-6922.  Focus on 'Community'   When \"gay travel\" became heard in the mainstream world, probably about 1990, the term was presumed to include lesbians, or gay women. But some women began to feel invisible. All-women cruises are increasing, and Alaska is a prime destination.   Charlie Rounds, the new president of RSVP Travel Productions, which until now has aimed at gay men, said the company was offering three all-women cruises on Seaspirit, the company's 100-passenger vessel. One cruise, leaving Feb. 4 from St. Martin, calls at Anguilla, St. Barthelemy, St. Kitts and Nevis. Fares start at $995 in double occupancy. On April 30, the ship will embark on a seven-night cruise along the west coast of Costa Rica, with fares starting at $1,295 in double occupancy. Mr. Rounds said that a seven-night Alaska cruise, leaving July 8 from Juneau at the same fares as the Costa Rica cruise, was selling best and would probably sell out.    Even so, RSVP will not offer all-women or all-men cruises after this year. \"We will focus on community: all of us all the time,\" Mr. Rounds said. Taking his parents on the Seaspirit and seeing them treated royally by his fellow gay passengers, he said, taught him that diversity was the way to overcome prejudice. RSVP's trips are available only through travel agents. RSVP: 2800 University Avenue Southeast, Minneapolis, Minn. 55414; (800) 328-7787 or (612) 379-4697.   Meanwhile, Jan Cooper of Special Expeditions in New Jersey has scheduled a women's cruise in Alaska for July 30 to Aug. 6. Ms. Cooper said, \"We have been operating voyages in Alaska for over 13 years and this is a personal effort to bring women from all over the continental United States to meet with the women of Alaska.\" For this, Elfin Cove, a community run mostly by women because the men are out fishing, is a particular destination. The 70-passenger Sea Lion will sail from Sitka and return to Juneau. The fare, in double occupancy, ranges from $2,860 to $3,980. Special Expeditions: 123 South Avenue East, Westfield, N.J. 07090; (800) 348-2358 or (908) 654-0048.    Olivia Cruises and Resorts in Oakland, Calif., a company catering to lesbians, is offering a seven-night Alaska cruise departing from Seward, Alaska, or Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on June 21 aboard the Royal Cruise Line's Royal Odyssey, with a capacity of 750 passengers. Fares start at $1,595 in double occupancy. Other charter cruises offered by this company are aboard the Seabreeze in the Caribbean, departing April 9, and aboard the Regent Spirit, cruising the French and Italian Rivieras. The six-night fares in double occupancy start at $795 for the Caribbean and $1,895 for the Mediterranean. Since it began in 1990 as an offshoot of Olivia Records, the company has sold 16 charters, 3 in Club Med villages. Olivia: 4400 Market Street, Oakland, Calif. 94608; (800) 631-6277 or (510) 655-0364. Adventure Tours   Toto Tours of Chicago will operate 21 small-group adventure tours this year, having started with one in 1991. New trips include a 16-day yacht cruise of the Greek and Turkish islands, for men only, leaving Aug. 30; a trip to the Netherlands timed for the Queen's birthday at the end of April, which will include the ceremonies marking the liberation of the Netherlands in World War II, and a trip to New Zealand Feb. 15 to March 1, with an available extension to the Gay Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, the following week. Toto Tours: 1326 West Albion Avenue, 3W, Chicago, Ill. 60626; (312) 274-8686.   Pied Piper Travel in New York is in its fifth year of selling blocks of cabins on cruises to gay clients. This year it has three scheduled sailings on the Queen Elizabeth 2: April 27 for a trip from New York or Fort Lauderdale to Southhampton, England; May 15, a five-day cruise from New York to Bermuda and back, and July 3, a seven-day cruise from New York to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and back.

A new company is Our Family Abroad. It operated a short season of escorted tours in 1994. In 1995, it will offer 23, 11 of them in Europe. The tours are operated by Globus and are their standard trips, but they are kept separate from the others, according to Peter K. Schulze, Our Family Abroad's president. Specific brochures, maps and coupons are provided to his clients. He uses Globus escorts who have volunteered for his tours, he said, to avoid homophobic guides; they are given special training. The brochure says that the tours are \"discreet by design\" and the groups appear \"no different on the outside\" from the many others touring the world. Single-country tours of Costa Rica, Egypt, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal are offered, as well as multi-country tours.

For Eakins, photography was a tool for teaching, for visual record keeping and exploration, but not an end in itself. Especially when compared to his powerful paintings, most of Eakins's photographs are less than remarkable. However, the large number of female and male nudes among his more conventional photographic images -- portraits of family and friends, snapshots of outings, picturesque scenes and farm animals -- attests to the originality of his methods. Eakins loathed polish and, when possible, chose students, friends, even himself for nude models to capture the awkwardness of real life.

The plan is essentially the same as the one Mr. Pataki, a Republican, proposed during last year's campaign: to reduce the top tax rate by 25 percent over four years, keep the bottom rate at 4 percent, reduce the number of people paying the top rate and provide a range of credits and deductions that would benefit lower-income taxpayers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Why Mentally Ill 'Walk Away' From Care","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/opinion/l-why-mentally-ill-walk-away-from-care-029395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In a sidebar to your Jan. 23 news article about psychiatric patients who \"just walk away\" from state psychiatric hospitals, you make the point that people with mental illness want what everyone wants: a job, a place to live, friends and freedom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Observing Auschwitz Anniversary, Pope Decries Anti-Semitism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/world/observing-auschwitz-anniversary-pope-decries-anti-semitism.html","abstract":"  Pope John Paul II, marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp in his native Poland, issued a strong condemnation of anti-Semitism and the \"arrogance of nationalisms\" today, and called on the world to pray and work to prevent \"other modern-day Auschwitzes.\"   The Pope has spoken out previously against the tragedy and horror of the Holocaust and today, in his regular Sunday address at St. Peter's Square, he said that the anniversary brought back memories of \"one of the darkest and most tragic hours of history.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Islanders Are Experiencing Reversal of Fortune on Ice","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/sports/hockey-islanders-are-experiencing-reversal-of-fortune-on-ice.html","abstract":"  The season is only 10 days and five games old, but after a terrible two-loss weekend, the Islanders may have set a record with the quickest team meeting ever.

After that, he was not certain about taking Mr. Greeley to New York, where Lasix and other medications are outlawed. Mr. Greeley set lightning fractions in the Hutcheson, running the half-mile in 44 seconds flat and the three-quarters in 1:091/5 before yielding as Valid Wager caught and passed him in the homestretch.

In a concert performance by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, this tale of a hapless, disturbed soldier beaten down by poverty, sleeping in sordid barracks, earning pennies by subjecting himself to perverse medical experiments and by submissively shaving the beard of a pompous military officer -- this tale of the archetypal modern victim -- actually became hauntingly lovely. Its horrific exclamations, sickly dances and unnerving juxtapositions were not distressing but fascinating; its characters almost seemed to take on abstract roles in a large-scale symphony.    The cast for this unusual exploration of the score was one of the best that can currently be assembled. The singers would have blossomed in a different direction in conventional operatic settings, but here they gave an esthetic polish to the jagged drama. Hildegard Behrens's singing as Marie, the soldier's mistress, was unblemished by the intermittent difficulties that have plagued her during recent seasons; in fact, her voice seems to have passed through a refiner's fire. This was unmannered, focused singing by one of our premier dramatic sopranos.

Keeping the colony thriving is the sole object of lives that are individually short but collectively enduring: a model of individual sacrifice for the greater good.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"1945: Leaving Norway : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/opinion/IHT-1945-leaving-norway-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - Adolf Hitler has probably told Premier Quisling of Norway that Germany must abandon Norway and withdraw most of its crack garrisons there to help save the Fatherland, it is learned from authoritative London sources.

Amended slightly over the years, the laws have two basic components. The first are mandatory prison terms -- ranging from three years to life in prison -- for those convicted of various drug offenses. The second requires judges to impose a prison term on anyone convicted of a second felony within 10 years of the first. The shortest sentence is one and a half years.

The most common type is known as sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin found in red blood cells. This leads to the red blood cells adopting an abnormal sickle-like shape under certain circumstances; with this shape, they are unable to deform as they pass through capillaries, causing blockages. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain in joints, anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, dizziness and stroke. The probability of severe symptoms, including long-term pain, increases with age. Without treatment, people with SCD rarely reach adulthood but with good healthcare, median life expectancy is between 58 and 66 years. All of the major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver, heart, kidneys, gallbladder, eyes, bones, and joints can be damaged from the abnormal functions of the sickle cells and their inability to effectively flow through the small blood vessels."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19950130","time":"1995-01-30

Rather, it was the challenge of tackling the first slice of the \"Divine Comedy,\" perhaps the greatest poem ever written. The \"Inferno\" had been rendered into English a hundred times by scholars and writers, and yet remained elusive, unmastered, poetry's Everest of the underworld.   Some, like Dorothy L. Sayers in the late 1940's, had gone for a strict line-by-line translation of the \"Divine Comedy,\" and ended up with a work that sounded stilted to the English ear, lacking the momentum of the Italian original. The poet Allen Mandelbaum, whose paperback version is widely used in university courses, worked 20 years to preserve the line-by-line sequence and diction of Dante, but did not attempt to match rhymes. Charles S.
