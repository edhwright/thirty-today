In the summer of 1613, the Globe itself was razed after gunfire ignited its thatch during a performance of Shakespeare's \"Henry VII.\" In 1809, the dramatist, politician and theater owner Richard Brinsley Sheridan watched the destruction of his Drury Lane from a nearby pub , and remarked, \"Cannot a man take a glass of wine by his own fireside?\" when friends commented on his sang-froid. Yet only three years later, the actor Edmund Kean made a sensational London debut in the replacement playhouse that has stood on the same site to this day.   Thanks to ever-tougher safety regulations, the fire gods have left London theaters alone in recent years. Yet, in the early hours of a Monday morning in February 1990 the improbable happened. For reasons still unclear, a fire broke out in the back stalls of the Savoy Theater in the Strand. Soon 50-foot flames were leaping from the roof and, fanned by a high wind, began to menace the famous hotel next door. By morning, little or nothing was left of what had been the finest Art Deco auditorium in England. The elegant gold-and-silver paneling, sculptured in 1929 by Gilbert Seale, who was given a fairly free hand by the interior designer Basil Ionides, was blistered and scarred beyond recognition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"Ways to Fix Fennel While It's at Its Best","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/nyregion/food-ways-to-fix-fennel-while-it-s-at-its-best.html","abstract":"  FENNEL looks rather like a bulbous head of celery, but it has a faint taste of anise.

Here was a region blessed with a year-round growing season, an unmatched wealth of seafood, and the motivation to use them well to serve a dining-out tourist industry.

Of course, the great Cuban and Caribbean influx, and the development of Miami as a Latin American center of commerce, have led to cultural and culinary influences no one could have imagined in the 1960's, say, when Wolfie's, the Miami Beach restaurant known for its delicatessen specialties, was king. Yet the books that have come along touting a new Florida cuisine (as if there had ever been an old one) always struck me as a bit unpersuasive; it didn't look like the birth of anything, or even a new synthesis, so much as like a simple borrowing from the peoples to the south.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"Airline Luggage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/travel/l-airline-luggage-327693.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: While visiting in Atlanta recently, we read an article (Travel Advisory, Oct. 17) telling of a 43 percent increase in baggage thefts at Kennedy Airport and of the improved means of security being planned and some plans that have already been implemented.

Certainly it's a pleasure this holiday season to find such a praiseworthy harvest, with something for nearly every gardening passion.   Those whose shelf space is limited, but who yearn for a single-volume reference book, will rejoice at THE AMERICAN HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ENCYCLOPEDIA OF GARDENING (Dorling Kindersley, $59.95), edited by Christopher Brickell. While no garden book should claim (as this one does) to be the \"definitive\" guide, Mr. Brickell's extremely thorough, two-inch-thick, densely packed tome comes remarkably close. What it lacks in lilting prose is more than compensated for in clarity, with much straightforward advice on a multitude of subjects. The first 16 chapters cover the creation of a garden, from early planning through learning about shrubs, perennials, topiary, water and rock gardens. The last eight chapters delve into the dirt, with notes on soils, fertilizers and tools, as well as entries on plant problems and the elements of basic botany. Many of the several thousand photographs illustrate step-by-step instructions: planting a moss-lined hanging basket, for example, or laying random paving for a path.

By Guy Dewez. (Princeton Architectural Press, $45.) In the course of conjecturing how Raphael might have completed the country house he designed for the Medici family on a hillside overlooking Rome but left unfinished at his death in 1520, the Paris-based historian Guy Dewez constructs an elegant meditation on the nature of architectural thought and our ability to revive the spirit of a vanished age. The photographs, drawings, diagrams and written documents he marshals in support of his speculations about the Villa Madama heighten an appreciation of Raphael's faultless sense of proportion and decorum, whether in painting or architecture.\n\nMore important, the most revered artist of his lifetime and his cultivated clients were convinced they could create a new Roman architecture worthy of the ancients. One majestic photograph of the interior of its portico from the Alinari Archives in Florence, taken a century ago, encourages the belief that even in a half-finished state the villa (now used by the Italian Government as a guest house for visiting dignitaries) attained the ideal its designer envisioned. The author's elevated, finely reasoned argument is of a piece with Raphael's Apollonian ndeavor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"Habitats/The Helen Hayes House; For Sale: 7-BR Victorian, w/Rvr Vus and Memories","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/realestate/habitats-the-helen-hayes-house-for-sale-7-br-victorian-w-rvr-vus-and-memories.html","abstract":"  IN the last year of her life, Helen Hayes sat at her mirrored dressing table in the cove of a big bay window looking past her own reflection to the terraced lawns dipping to the Hudson River.   \"She became lost in her fantasies,\" said the actor James MacArthur, her son, who is now selling the family's fine Victorian house in Nyack. \"She said she saw my sister and me as kids, throwing snowballs on the slope.

They can be identified by their call, a high-pitched \"guop\" that sounds quite different from the double \"au-unk\" of Canada geese. \n\nDistinguishing snow geese from other waterfowl is easy by ear, said Lucy Miller, an aide in the Town of East Hampton Department of Natural Resources. Ms. Miller teaches a course in bird identification. She said they sounded like a group of sick children. \"They sound like a nursery in a hospital, when there's a whole bunch of them together,\" Ms. Miller said. \"It's nasal.\"\n\nAccording to \"Ducks, Geese and Swans of North America\" by Frank Bellerose, snow geese breed on islands in the Arctic, on Greenland and in northeastern Canada. Generally they fly a narrow migration corridor down the East Coast, but farther west than the Atlantic Flyway. Adult snow geese average 7 1/2 pounds for males and 6 for females. The heaviest male ever recorded was 19 pounds and female 12 pounds.\n\nThe birds' median wingspread is 18.4 inches, and they measure 28 to 33 inches from their pink bills to their white tails. A clutch of four eggs is average, with a success rate of 70 percent. The female incubates, and the male stands guard over the nest. Goslings eat 24 hours a day for the first few months. Their parents feed them.\n\nAn Audubon bird counter on the North Fork, Paul Stoutenburgh, said some snow geese were on corn fields and ponds in his area. \"They love sweet corn,\" Mr. Stoutenburgh said. \"I've seen more snow geese this year than I've ever seen before, and I'm not sure why or whether it's a trend that will continue.\n\n\"I remember 40 or 50 years ago when Canada geese were rare on the North Fork, and now they're a problem. They enjoy the rye and sod farms.\"\n\nMr. Stoutenburgh suggested a way to get rid of the geese. But there would be major noise for a while. \"Guns move them off,\" Mr. Stoutenburgh said. \"Like the ones grape growers use to move starlings and blackbirds. They have gas-explosion guns going off all the time. Corn growers and people with peas use them. They go off every 20 seconds or so. It's not a sharp crack. It sounds more like a hollow boom, not like a rifle. They're loud. You can tell the difference.\"\n\nBut can the geese?\nANNE C.

But they are far from old and very far from innocent.   Mr. Waits has made a pop career combining an ominous, despairing sneer with a bemused sentimentality; here all genres become subversive. Gospel turns demonic; vaudeville turns acidic; 1930's ballads turn morbid. Some of the best songs sound familiar, as if known for a long while; on closer examination they seem to be walking around in drag.

The game was back, but Grizzard was gone, a victim of a murder-suicide shooting last Wednesday in San Diego.   There were 27 Navy seniors on the 1993 team that either played or practiced with Grizzard in 1990, when the quarterback completed his college career by setting a school record for total offense with 5,666 yards.

Peirce founded the American school of philosophy known as pragmatism and introduced the term into English. But that was 1878. By 1905, the word pragmatism had been so well popularized -- and, in Peirce's view, so corrupted -- that the philosopher disowned his word.   When an idea becomes a hindrance to clarity, Peirce said -- even when the idea is one's own -- it's best to pat it on the head and send it away. That's good advice, especially for people who write about politics. The cliches are subtly invasive and, ultimately, blinding.

That question, at the heart of a long, heated public debate over the East Side's soaring residential towers, may soon be answered, Last week, the City Planning Commission heard testimony on two proposed zoning amendments that would effectively reduce the height of new towers and encourage tower-on-a-base, wedding-cake buildings as opposed to tall, thin towers. The commissioners are schedule to vote on the amendments on Dec. 20. If approved, the measures will go before City Council. PROPOSAL 1    Co-sponsored by the Manhattan Borough President and Community Board 8, this amendment rezones 143 blocks between 59th and 96th Streets and between Eas End and Third Avenues to conform with the zoning pattern in the rest of the city. It would reduce the permissible depth of lots along avenues from 125 feet to 100 feet. Because the size of a building's bases determines the height allowed, this would have the effect of reducing the building's height. PROPOSAL 2    Sponsored by the Department of City Planning, this amendment would apply citywide to buildings on avenues but have particular impact on high-density residential areas like the Upper East Side. The amendment calls for wedding-cake towers on bulky residential buildins with high street walls. This would effectively reduce the maximum height of towers from 50 to 32 floors. The amendment would eliminate the extra-floor bonuses given to developers for incorporating plazas; bonuses for including moderate-cost housing in designs would remain. FOR    \"The rezoning is consistent with citywide trends, reducing avenue zoning depts to 100 feet. Eliminating the plaza bonus will increse incentives to utilize a bonus of far more public merit, lower-cost housing.\" Ruth W. Messinger, Manhattan Borough President.    \"We stronly support the amendments reducing bulk on the avenues. They will restore and reinforce the neighborhood character of the Upper East Side and retain existing, affordable housing units.\" Genie Rice, president of Civitas, an East Side zoning organization AGAINST    \"These changes will unquestionably add to the costs of housing and reduce affordable housing. The occasional misuse of plaza bonuses is not a reason to eliminate them. Plazas address a specific need, but they should be truly public, better used and better enforced.\" Michael Slattery, senior vice president, Real Estate Board of New York.    \"The proposed rezoning would negatively affect the ability of developers to provide efficient apartment layouts and deigners to create alternative spaces.\" Sherida Paulsen, a member of the American Institute of Architects.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"Marion Grover, Jonathan Radin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/style/weddings-marion-grover-jonathan-radin.html","abstract":"  Marion Anthony Grover, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Elliot B.

But if architecture's version of that story is to be more than a fairy tale, architects must learn to do more than tell it. They must also try to live it. Louis Sullivan once said that for him architecture was not an art but a religion -- \"part of the greater religion of democracy.\" He had a good sense of priorities. It is fine for architects to focus on symbolic forms and images. But if their symbols are disconnected from social reality, their buildings may end up mocking the values they represent.   For the past year, residents of the South Bronx have been working to create a solidly democratic content for architectural form. Rather than sit back and wait for architects and planners to tell them how to improve the prospects for their legendarily troubled borough, they have joined with architects and planners to renegotiate the social contract between citizens and builders. Bronx Center, as the heartening project for this area is called, is becoming a national model for community-based planning, though that dull term scarcely conveys the excitement of an undertaking that promises to change the way people think about urban design.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"The Difficult Math of Welfare Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/us/the-difficult-math-of-welfare-reform.html","abstract":"  There are approximately 60,000 words in the Administration's plan to overhaul the welfare system, but three of them have the potential to mock the rest and expose President Clinton's bold promises as empty slogans.

While dinners with family and friends will, of course, be a fixture of the season, much can be said for replacing some dinners with brunch, a natural meeting time for all generations: it eases anxiety for those reluctant to drive at night and can include the young, otherwise affected by early bedtimes. \n\nWhile putting out a pitcher of juice, a pot of coffee, some bagels or brioche might suffice, brunch can be considerably jollier in a tree-decked dining room festooned with garlands, wreaths and bows where the menu is someone else's responsibility. Restaurants have risen to the task with glistening decorations scheduled to remain at least through Jan. 2. Celebrants can enjoy the snug warmth from a crackling Colonial hearth under a mantle swagged with evergreens, or they can take in long views obscured by foliage in summer.

Sewn onto a leather strap and worn as a bracelet, ring, belt, anklet or necklace. Also tucked into braids and dreadlocks and sewn onto coats, handbags and hats.\n\nWHO WEARS THEM: The growing visibility of the shells seems spurred by the fashion choices of musicians like Janet Jackson, Lenny Kravitz and the group Arrested Development, who all wear them in MTV videos. The shells are sold at bead shops, African import shops, sidewalk vendors and flea markets.\n\n\"Cowries are getting more popular every day,\" said Bangally Jagana, owner of Bangally African Expo at 34 1/2 St. Marks Place (near Second Avenue) in New York. His sales have almost doubled in the last six months, he said. \nTHE NAME: Pronounced COW-ree or CUR-ree in the United States, KOR-ree in Africa and the Caribbean. The name comes from the Hindi word kauri, meaning pearl. The early Greek name meant \"little pig,\" a reference to the shell's stubby, rounded back. The Romans called them porci or porculi, in keeping with the pig theme. The French called them porcelaine, an antecedent of the word porcelain.\nWHAT THEY MEAN: Depends on whom you ask. They are worn as tokens of good luck, symbols of pride in one's African heritage or a reflection of earthiness and spirituality.\nCHARMED HISTORY: Cro-Magnon women wore breast coverings and girdles made out of cowries. In Pompeii, women wore cowries because they believed they prevented sterility, and the shell is still associated with fertility in parts of Africa, Asia and the South Pacific. Ancient Egyptians placed cowries over the eyes of mummies to guarantee sight in the afterworld. The Algonquin Indians and tribes in Sierra Leone worshipped cowries and considered them oracles in time of war.\n\nIn ancient China, the dead were buried with cowries in their mouths so that they would eat and live well in the hereafter. African tribal leaders used them to decorate canoes, weapons, wives and themselves. In the United States, the Plains Indians favored them because of their similarity to highly prized elks' teeth.\n\nOLD MONEY: The shells, 40 to a string, were legal tender in many parts of the world as far back as the fourth century B.C. Africans traded extensively for cowries, and hundreds of tons were shipped from Ceylon and other Indian Ocean ports to Zanzibar and East Africa.\n\nWhen metal coins were introduced in China in the seventh century B.C., they were shaped like cowries. Greek coins resembling the cowrie soon followed. The shells are still used as currency in remote areas of Australia and Africa.\nPRICES: A single shell sells for about 85 cents. Simple earrings cost $4 to $12; rings and necklaces, $15 to $20. A basket covered with cowries is about $85 to $120.\nINFLATION: In 17th-century Africa, two shiny cowries could be traded for a nice wife. Later, the price jumped to 2,500 cowries. In the 18th century, 60,000 shells would insure a supermodel-type bride, and 20,000 would garner an ordinary spouse. A cow cost 2,500 shells, 500 bought a goat and 25 bought a chicken. In India in the early 1800's, 16 million cowries once bought a large bungalow, and a church was built for 160 million shells.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"Jill R.

She just doesn't know what she is giving or which relatives are receiving. Except for the new car she bought for her son Jeff and his wife, Debra. \"They'll be picking that up any day now,\" she said.   Her other gifts to loved ones -- the trips to the Super Bowl and the Mets training camp, the $5,000 watch, the computer and the CD players -- all arrived unexpectedly. As did the 52 jars of Francesco Rinaldi Spaghetti Sauce. \"I handed them out at the family seder,\" she said.   Mrs. Strell, of Jericho, is as surprised as her relatives with her gifts because she doesn't buy them. She wins them. An obsessive sweepstakes enterer, she spends her spare time filling out forms and mailing them out. But instead of putting her name on the entry blanks, she puts relatives' names. \"I look at the prize and decide who would like it,\" she said.   \"The other day she asked me if I'd rather have a Lincoln Continental or a Town Car,\" Mrs. Strell's husband, Hyman, said. After his wife won a Chevrolet last month for their daughter-in-law, Mr. Strell takes this kind of question seriously. \"I decided on a Town Car,\" he said. 'Don't Know Who's Getting What'     With a philosophy of \"it's better to give than to receive,\" Mrs. Strell enters contests for others. Which makes for interesting gift giving. \"I don't know who's getting what, when,\" she said.   Her sweepstakes passion started about 15 years ago. \"My kids had started college,\" she said, \"and I had sent away for a sweepstakes newsletter. I started filling out entries in the children's names. I did it to keep in touch with them, and get them some crazy things.\"   Before that, the Strells had led a normal existence with the post offices of Nassau County. Married 39 years, they have lived in their split-level for 32. They raised three children, Jeff, Barbara and Martin. Mr. Strell was an engineer at Sperry. In his spare time he obtained a doctorate.   Now retired from one career, he has begun another, as a substitute mathematics teacher. He tries to work that into his schedule, between mailing his wife's entries at different post offices and buying her stamps.  \"I do it for her,\" he said. \"I'm a statistician. I know what the chances of winning sweepstakes are.\"   Yet his wife defies those odds. With her long brown ponytail and engaging giggle, Mrs. Strell seems the high school cheerleader frozen in a middle-age body. Perhaps her positive attitude produces her winning ways. She was a laboratory technician before her sweepstakes career began and appropriately enough now works for a bank. Before the entry blank and 3 X 5-card filling, her spare time had been spent \"volunteering for everything,\" she said, \"the P.T.A., the temple sisterhood, the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts.\"   Then came the day when The Readers Digest and the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes took on new meaning. \"If they send to me, I'll send it back,\" she said. Not satisfied to wait for the mail, she began seeking out sweepstakes entries.   \"I started with skill contests,\" she said. \"I never won a thing. Oh, I did win honorable mention once. I used a quote from Dr. Seuss for something. I won a piggy bank.\"   It was like lining up the three cherries on the slot machine and hearing the coins drop out. \"I really enjoyed getting something in the mail,\" she said. Then she realized that she could receive even more enjoyment if her relatives' mailboxes filled up, thanks to her.   The problem with that is the relatives don't always know the prizes are from her. \"I went to my brother-in-law's 70th birthday,\" she said, \"and his grandson walked in wearing a Mets uniform. My niece said, 'Oh, Justin must have entered something.' He was the Mets batboy for a day, and he got the uniform.\" Mrs. Strell was crestfallen. \"I said: 'Justin didn't enter that contest. I did. For him.' \"   It may be better to give than to receive, but it's also nice to know that you gave. With Mrs. Strell's hobby, that is not always the case. So sometimes when a sweepstakes offers a prize like 365 coupons for M & M candies, she enters in her own name. Then when she wins -- she always seems to win something -- she can hand out the M & M's. Or the other assorted merchandise that she has won and stored in her house.   The new gas grill may go to a son. But other relatives be advised. These are some gifts you may receive this holiday season. Sharing the couch with Mrs. Strell one recent evening were a Miller Beer fanny pack, a \"Beverly Hills 90210\" calendar, a King Cobra Beer black jacket, a Boca West black baseball cap and twin baby dolls from Mattel.   Her husband may get the deluxe coffee pot. \"I have no idea where I won it,\" she said. \"I don't keep records of what I enter. Things just arrive in the mail.\" And not because she sends out hundreds of entries for each contest. \"I only allocate $2 of postage per sweepstake,\" she said. \"That's seven envelopes or 11 post cards. You have to budget. I spend about $2,000 a year. But I figure I come out even in prizes.\" At least family members do.   The sweepstakes expert has advice for those who wish to follow her unconventional trail of gift giving. \"It's important to scatter the mailings over the life of the sweepstakes,\" she said. And scatter the entries over various post offices. \"That way they don't arrive in the same mailbag,\" she said. It also might help to have a semiretired mate who can take care of the mailings and buy the commemorative stamps. Do unusual stamps help? \"They can't hurt,\" Mrs. Strell said. The statistician, Mr. Strell, said there were no statistics on whether interesting stamps or colorful envelopes helped win sweepstakes.   But his wife said: \"Why not put on stamps that pretty up an envelope? I think it helps with the local contests.\" It may be hard to resist those stamps and Mrs. Strell's neat little handwriting.   \"Oh, you must write the envelopes by hand,\" she said. \"The rules say don't type, and you must follow the rules. You have to read them very carefully. Some are limited to age, sex, location.\" None of which matter to Mrs. Strell, because she has sufficient relatives to meet every age, sex and location requirement.   \"Want to see my mailing for tomorrow?\" she asked. For those whose sweepstakes knowledge is limited to Irish racehorses it is a revelation. Out come 30 envelopes, all neatly addressed. There is the Les Paul Giveaway, the North Shore Animal League sweepstakes and giveaways from liquor and soap companies.   \"You have to keep plugging away,\" Mrs. Strell said. But novices beware. \"A legitimate sweepstakes never asks for money,\" she said.   Finding legitimate sweepstakes forms is easy. \"They're everywhere, once you know where to look,\" she said. Her son Jeff, of Mineola, looked in a record shop. \"He's a guitarist,\" she said. \"He saw this TDK sweepstakes entry blank to win a car and he brought it to me. Everybody in the family looks for sweepstakes and brings them back to mother.\"   Why not fill them out themselves? \"Because nobody is as crazy as mother,\" Mr. Strell said.   \"Jeff gives me the entries with one hand and laughs with the other,\" Mrs. Strell said. \"So I put the car-entry blank in his wife's name. Then it won. So now it's her car.\" Mrs. Strell had the last sweepstakes laugh on that one.   As well as the time that her husband picked up the telephone, and a man from Traffic Magazine asked for Mrs. Strell. \"I told him, 'My wife isn't interested in Traffic Magazine,' \" Mr.  Strell recalled. \"And he said: \"That's funny. She was interested enough to enter one of our sweepstakes. I'm calling to tell her she won a CD player.' \"   \"I won a watch for my sister,\" Mrs. Strell said. \"It was a man's watch. So my sister said maybe she should give it to her daughter's boyfriend. But before she did she called up the company to find out how much the watch was worth. Then she called me. She said: 'I'm keeping the watch. They are only 11 of them in existence. It's worth $5,000!' \"   Mrs. Strell has \"given\" her nephew a bicycle, her niece a computer and her sons trips to the Mets camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., and the Super Bowl in Miami. Recently she got her husband a miniature television set.  \"Or maybe you won that,\" she said to him.   \"No, you won it at the bank,\" he replied. \"Wasn't it a second-chance drawing?\"   \"Well, it doesn't matter,\" she said. \"We won two. I gave the other to my son.\"   To be a true sweepstake winner, Mrs. Strell said, \"you have to win a trip, a car and money.\"   \"We're still waiting for the money,\" she said. A purist, she doesn't count a $25 gift certificate from Pathmark.   It would be wonderful, she said, if the money arrived in a relative's mailbox this holiday season. If not, she can always send some of the prize T-shirts she keeps piled in the spare bedroom. The Perrier and Ronzoni one is especially appealing. \"My family has never bought a T-shirt,\" she said. \"We wear them as nightgowns. We use them for rags.\"   Perhaps the family has gotten a bit blase about all the winning. \"Perhaps,\" Mrs. Strell said. \"They win a T-shirt, they don't call.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"Stalking L.I.'s Colonies of Feral Cats","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/nyregion/stalking-lis-colonies-of-feral-cats.html","abstract":"SUSAN DARNELL BOYD ignored the heart-wrenching yowls from the five caged cats in the back seat of her BMW and kept her eyes fixed on the North Fork back road that she had driven hundreds of times. \n\nThe cats belonged to no one, although a caretaker drives every day to feed them at the abandoned shed where they live.

After all potatoes were part of the American way of life, and the extraordinarily rich soil - some of the most fertile in the United States - produced heavy yields of the Katahdin potato.\n\n This was the dull but reliable smooth, round white tuber, the mainstay of what had become since the 20's almost a single-crop farm economy encompassing half of Long Island.\n\n But as the East End became increasingly the playground of the rich and famous, or infamous, potato farms gave way to the elaborate \"architectural statements.\" People traveled from afar to gawk at a glittering all-steel residence erected in a former field, a home that blinded neighbors for miles around, and to see the mystery millionaire Barry Trupin's never-finsished Disneyesque castle on the dunes.\nAcreage and Machinery Necessary\n\n Pototo farming as a single crop requires a lot of acreage and machinery to be profitable. You can't plant 'taters on priceless real estate, and so many of the farmers who remain, particularly the younger ones, have wisely turned to planting perishable, more labor-intensive but much more profitable crops.\n\n These include cauliflower, brussels sprouts, Savoy cabbages, chard, kale and its flamboyant flower-like decorative versions and a variety of lettuces and salad greens, as well as the usual sweet corn, tomatoes and eggplants. Leeks, a new crop locally, are spectacularly superior to the expensive specimens one used to hunt for in specialty markets.\n\n More recently, with the revolution in American eating habits and cuisine, all kinds of herbs - basil and cilantro are best sellers - and even some Oriental vegetables along with mizuma, daikon and bok choy have displaced the common spud, a plant in danger of becoming the Rodney Dangerfield of vegetables. Indeed some younger farmers say that \"Katahdins were before my time\" and few on the South Fork grow potatoes on a large commercial scale. But that is changing again. What was is back.\nPlanting Goes Back 40 Years\n\n Some of the decendants of the Polish farmers who migrated here in the late 19th century - the Zaluskis, the Babinskis, the Falkowskis - are still on the land, growing all the new stuff, but again potatoes. The Zaluskis, father and son, still farm on the land bought by their forbearer after he came to the States from Poland in the late 19th century.\n\n The elder Mr. Zaluski still raises the Katahdins and Superiors he started with in his Water Mill fields 40 years ago, but his son Billy raises a wide range of vegetables and only a limited crop of small red potatoes - Norland reds, Sangre reds, LaRouges and 1257's - for his family to use and to supply his two farmstands.\n\n Fred Sands raises only enough potatoes for himself and his outlet, The Other Stand, in Noyac. \"There's no money in them,\" he said, and his acreage, he explained, \"isn't right for potatoes.\"\n\n Tom Falkowski raises several interesting varieties of potatoes - Yukon Gold, Green Mountains, russets and tiny reds. They go under the general name of \"new\" potatoes, but are actually a number of different varieties halted in the development.\n\n To a health- and weight- conscious public, the nutritional profile of the spud should ingratiate it. A baked potato weighing about half a pound has 145 calories, 4 grams of protein, 33 grams of carbohydrate and 14 milligrams of calcuim, but 100 milligtams of phosphorus and a whopping 782 milligrams of Potassium. But no fat.\n\n The yellow-fleshed varieties are getting a bigger play, possibly because their color presents at least the illusion of butter. Pat Struck, owner of the Farmers Market in Amagansett, said that next spring she might plant some of the newer, novelty potatoes and an oblong baker with 20 percent more protein. The baker was named Butte Frontier by the University of Idaho, which developed it.\n\n Yukon Gold, a smooth, round, yellow-fleshed potatoe with an earthly, deeply potatoey flavor, has begun to get billing on Manhattan menus. Michigan morels and Maine fiddlehead ferns have long been accorded indentity, but potatoes were always just \"potatoes,\" whether they were mashed, sauteed, fried, steamed or baked.\nStudy in Purple\n\n Some Long Island aFarmers have always kept a little space for early red bliss salad potatoes, but they are now planting exotic tiny purple potatoes, whos purple flesh stays that way after cooking ladyfingers, sometimes called \"fingerlings,\" Finnish Golds and Norgold Russets.\n\n The experts seem to have given up. They started giving potato varities numbers instead of names. Fortunately for consumers, this did not work for farmers either, and so names had to be found. The \"657\" that originated in Maine is now called the Norwiss.\n\n An heirloom variety called Green Mountain makes the most fabulous, fluffy and delectable mashed potatoes known to man. Unfortunately, it fell from popularity because of its deep eyes and irregular shape, which makes peeling slightly more difficult.\n\n This potato is well worth seeking out. It is still grown by Tom Falkowski and sold at his stand, The Country Gardens, as well as at the Green Thumb in Water Mill.\n\n Undoubtedly, a few other Long Island farmers still plant Green Mountains and should grow more. They are dug in October and usually sold out in a month. A supply laid in now will last in an unheated garage until mid-March.\nA Resemblance to Idahos\n\n Russets are a nifty Long Island-grown potato that most closely resembles the classic Idaho baker. In most way except for their thin, pale shiny skins, California bakers resemble Idahos, are widely distributed all over Long Island and compete strongly with native-grown species.\n\n Besides the unique purple potatoes (Peruvian Blues), another oddity popped up this fall: the \"white\" (actually a pale pinkish tan) sweet potato called boniatos, which originated in Central America. \n\n The sheer skin of this tuber scrubs to a near white that somehow reminds one of a Mexican Hairless dog. Peeled and then boiled, they whip to a light, delicately sweet cloud with the addition of only low-fat milk and a small amount of butter. Like all potato purees, they should be silky and lumpless, which can be achieved with an electric mixer, not a processor, or a food mill and a wooded spoon.\nWith Meat or Poultry\n\n Because their sweetness is minimal, the \"white\" sweet potato goes well with most any meat or poultry entree. The more sugary, moist-fleshed orange sweet potatoes that Americans mistakenly call \"yams\" also grow well on Long Island, even though they originated in Central America.\n\n The Island's proximity to the Gulf Stream and other climatic factors puts it in the same zone as Virginia on planting maps. The hot, dry summer just past was especially felicitous for potato chips and roasted potatoes and should be more widely and wisely used in daily cookery, as they are a nutritional bonanza rich in vitamin A and calcium.\n\n They are more fragile and bruise more easily than white potatoes and should be used fairly quickly after purchase. All potatoes should be stored in a cool, dry, dim place with good air circulation and, like bananas, never, never in the refrigirator.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931205","headline":"In the Region/Long Island;\nRedesigning Projects to Move in a Changing Market","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/realestate/in-the-regionlong-island-redesigning-projects-to-move-in-a.html","abstract":"THE decline in the appeal of attached housing in a highly competitive sales market has led several town-house builders on Long Island to shift course.

He found a couch in a trash heap on the corner, salvaged a bed from another rubbish pile and anchored a three-legged cot with a rusty golf club.   Just before Sur's money ran out, serendipity seemed to write a blank check. He found a coaching job in Detroit that came with a house and car. Next, he found a dance partner in Renee Roca of Colorado Springs. By early 1993, skating in a sensual style more European than American, Roca and Sur became national ice-dancing champions. He seemed to have a surfeit of good fortune as the 1994 Winter Olympics approached, a new life, a new partner, a successful career. But there is one thing that Sur doesn't yet have -- United States citizenship -- and without it, he will be unable to compete in the Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway. Race Against Time    His problem is this: Sur has been in the country fewer than four years and the residency requirement for citizenship is five years. Representative Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado, and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Democrat of Colorado, where Sur now lives, have attempted to speed up his naturalization process in Congress. On Nov. 18, the House judiciary subcommittee on immigration voted unanimously to forward Sur's case to the full judiciary committee. If approved, the bill must go before the full House and Senate. Time is not in Sur's favor. Congress is in recess until Jan. 25, and the Olympics begin on Feb. 12. It is rare to grant accelerated American citizenship for strictly athletic reasons.

But with its incomparably rich orchestral fabric, its taut evolutionary musical logic and its epically scaled four-movement structure, it can also be viewed as a powerful oversize symphony. Hearing the fresh emphases and nuances, let alone the sheer imposing sonorities, that a great symphony orchestra can find in the score is often thrilling.   Christoph von Dohnanyi, the music director of the Cleveland Orchestra and an experienced Wagner hand, is bringing Wagner's entire \"Ring\" cycle to Cleveland in semistaged performances and recording it for Decca/London in a multi-year project. \"Die Walkure\" was done last year. \"Rheingold\" was performed on Thursday and Saturday evenings and will be recorded this week. \"Siegfried\" is projected for the 1995-96 season, as the search for a suitably heroic tenor continues; \"Gotterdammerung,\" for the following season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931207","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/07/nyregion/c-corrections-209493.html","abstract":"  A picture caption yesterday about Palestinians who mourned for a vegetable vendor killed on Saturday in a Jewish settlement on the West Bank referred incorrectly to Hebron, where the vendor worked.
