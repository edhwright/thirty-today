LONG ISLAND SOUND STATUS REPORT   The Long Island Sound is a vital but ecologically troubled estuary, threatened by pollution that pours into it every day from sewage-treatment plants, according to a preliminary report of a seven-year study of the Sound.

As usual, Koufax is in a class of his own, this time as the only 20-game winner to decide to call it quits before the next season. Two other pitchers -- Ed Cicotte and Lefty Williams, both of the Chicago White Sox -- also won 20 games in their final season in the majors, which was 1920 in both cases. But both had quits called for them by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball's first commissioner.

That means that anyone under 17 must be accompanied by an adult.

It is what he calls the \"esthetic myopia\" of the Motion Picture Association of America's rating procedure, which gives R ratings to extremely -- perhaps gratuitously -- violent movies, like \"Basic Instinct.\" But the association, Mr. Malle said, has another set of standards for serious films dealing with sexual matters. - \"This is weird to me,\" the director said in a recent interview at his publicity agent's office. \"Maybe I'm from a different culture.

A16  U.S. WARY OF ACTING IN BOSNIA    News analysis: Although Slobodan Milosevic's victory puts pressure on the West to live up to its warnings on Serbian aggression, the allies seem to have little taste for military action to stop the killing in Bosnia.  A1  SOMALI WOMEN TAKE CHARGE    Though they have suffered enormously from civil war and famine, women are redefining their role in Somalia. They monopolize trade, run relief agencies and sometimes even gain renown as looters in a country dependent on food aid.  A1    The U.N. chief insisted again that Americans disarm Somalis.  A15    Gunmen started moving menacing vehicles out of Mogadishu.  A14  MILITIA FIRES ON PALESTINIANS    About 415 Palestinians exiled in southern Lebanon tried to march back into Israeli-controlled territory but were stopped when Israel's client militia fired at them. Two were reported wounded.  A1    A look at Israel's perilous \"security zone\" in southern Lebanon.  A3  AIR CRASH KILLS 54 IN PORTUGAL    At least 54 people were dead and 4 were missing after a Dutch airliner slammed onto a runway and burst into flames in southern Portugal. But 282 survived through a mixture of luck and safety measures.  A6  RUSSIA TRODS MARKET ROAD    Despite a series of recent setbacks for President Yeltsin's drive to establish a market economy, many Western economists say and that the move toward capitalism may be too far along to be reversed.  A8  CANADA'S DOOR IS CLOSING    Long considered a model of generosity in granting asylum to the world's persecuted, Canada is tightening its immigration rules.

A4  National A18, B8-9  ACCUSATION IN PASSPORT CASE    The Justice Department said the White House political director may have helped direct the search of Bill Clinton's passport files during the Presidential election campaign, the first time Federal officials have suggested that the White House may have helped orchestrate the effort to find damaging information about the Democratic candidate.  A1  WOMEN'S GROUPS CRITICIZED    Clinton lashed out at groups who have been complaining about the pace of appointments of women to his Cabinet as he named a utility executive, Hazel O'Leary, as Secretary of Energy and former Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina as Secretary of Education.  A1  OUTSIDER FOR ENERGY . . .    Clinton's choice of Hazel O'Leary as Energy Secretary was bound to please groups who had been looking for the inclusion of more women and blacks in his Cabinet, but it may take longer for energy companies and environmental groups to see how they feel.  B9  . . . AND REFORMER FOR EDUCATION    Richard Riley, Clinton's selection as Education Secretary, is a champion of education reform with a knack for getting the changes he wants.

The Chemical Bank ECAC Holiday Festival begins Monday at Madison Square Garden with Kentucky playing Rutgers, followed by St. John's against Manhattan. The next day, Seton Hall kicks off the first Seton Hall-Meadowlands Tournament at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena. The No. 7 Pirates play Cornell, and No. 21 California faces James Madison in the opening round. It will be the first collegiate appearance in the New York City area for the Bears' heralded freshman, Jason Kidd.   Fordham travels to Honolulu for the Rainbow Classic and Marist is off to Hilo, Hawaii, for the Big Island Invitational. Manhattan    Manhattan Coach Fran Fraschilla was as confused as his players after the Jaspers (6-1) traveled to Milwaukee to play Marquette in the Bradley Center, then went to play Bradley in Peoria, Ill., at the Target Center but stayed in the Marquette Hotel. (Traveler's advisory: Manhattan lost to Marquette, but beat Bradley.)   Besides some geography, Fraschilla learned that whatever venue the Jaspers play in, forward Keith Bullock has a good time. Bullock, who is averaging 17.8 points and 7.8 rebounds, is currently fifth in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference in both categories.   But he's not the only threat on the Jaspers, who have three other players averaging double figures. Carey Edwards (13.8), Jamal Marshall (10.3) and Brenton Birmingham (10.2) round out a balanced attack.   As for the game with St. John's in the Holiday Festival, \"it'll be a dream come true for me,\" Fraschilla said. \"I've been inside Madison Square Garden literally hundreds of times, yet this will be the first time I'm a head coach on that floor. It will definitely be special.\" Columbia    Buck Jenkins continues to climb the Lions' career-scoring list. Jenkins (19.8 points per game) is currently third on the list with a career total of 1,308 points. Jenkins is the first Columbia player to crack the school's top-five scoring list since Heyward Dotson did it in 1970. Jenkins replaced him at No. 3 but still trails Jim McMillan (1,758) and Chet Forte (1,611).   The Lions are 4-2. Their next game is Monday against Lafayette, followed by a game against Villanova in Philadelphia Dec. 30. Fordham    Fordham (2-3) will be playing in a tough tournament when it competes in the Rainbow Classic. It will have four Top 20 teams -- No. 2 Kansas, No. 5 North Carolina, No. 6 Michigan and No. 17 Nebraska -- for company, along with Hawaii, Southwest Louisiana and Jackson State.   The Rams play Hawaii Saturday in the first game, with the winner to take on the Kansas-Jackson State winner.   Siena    The Saints (2-3) are coming off a 70-58 loss to Massachusetts and a 74-70 overtime victory over Hartford. Their leading scorer, Lee Matthews, was the M.A.A.C. player of the week after shooting 60 percent from the floor and averaging 17 points and 13 rebounds. He leads the M.A.A.C. in scoring (19 points per game), rebounding (12) and field-goal percentage (65.6). Marist    It's off to the Big Island tourney in Hawaii, where the Red Foxes (3-3) play Ball State on Monday.    Junior guard Izett Buchanan is off to a solid start for the Red Foxes. Buchanan, a first-team all-Northeast Conference performer, is averaging 17 points and 8 rebounds. He was named N.E.C. player of the week after averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds in the Pepsi-Marist Classic.   But the best news for the Red Foxes was provided by senior forward Fred Ingles. Ingles, who missed all but four games last season with ankle-tendon injuries, scored 17 points in the Red Foxes' victory over Central Connecticut State. He is the team's third-leading scorer, averaging 11 points a game. Hofstra    The team without a conference gave St. John's all it could handle last Saturday, losing, 58-56, on a last-second shot by the Redmen's David Cain.   The St. John's game was the first of a five-game road trip for the Flying Dutchmen (2-5), who play 20 of their 27 games on the road this year.   Hofstra plays at Rutgers tonight, then has back-to-back road contests against No. 24 Tulane on Sunday and No. 19 U.N.L.V. on Dec. 30.   Hofstra is on the road so much because the East Coast Conference collapsed after two members, Towson State and Maryland-Baltimore County, joined the Big South, Rider went to the Northeast and Brooklyn dropped its program. Hunter    Senior forward Jose Rodriquez leads three Hawks players who are at the top of Division III statistics.   Rodriguez is first in rebounding (15.5) and Demetrius Patterson and Robert Carter are tied at No. 1 in steals, averaging five a game.   Rodriguez started the season with a 25-rebound performance against York College, the highest individual single-game total in the country thus far. He is also sixth in the nation in blocked shots (3.0). The Hawks are 2-1. Baruch    Gerald Thomas won rookie-of-the-week honors in the City University Athletic Conference for the second consecutive time. Thomas, who never played in high school, is averaging 19 points and 3 rebounds. Baruch is 5-4. York    The Cardinals' record -- 3-6 -- doesn't say much, but Mike Nicholson's performance speaks loudly.  Nicholson was named player of the week after scoring 47 points and grabbing 23 rebounds in the RIT Brodie tournament. Nicholson, a 6-5 sophomore, leads the conference in scoring with an average of 20 points per game, and in rebounding, with a 10.4 figure.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19921222","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-92001926912.html","abstract":"Nothing is more crucial to the outcome of the \"Grand Design\" for the European Community than the response of its would-be members to the war in the Balkans.

Created in 1976, \"Pas de Duke\" celebrated the bicentennial, the music of Duke Ellington, and the dancing of Mikhail Baryshnikov, a guest artist, and Judith Jamison, the Ailey star. But the dance is far more than the occasion piece it first seems. Ailey created a modern-dance version of a classical pas de deux, emphasizing its buried element of sexual teasing. He also captured the sassy exuberance of Ellington's music, as well as its fleeting undertone of melancholy and its melodic lushness, in five pieces that suggest Ellington's range and, physicalized onstage, the complexity of his music.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19921222","headline":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/opinion/IHT-letters-to-the-editor-91706266081.html","abstract":"Do we really need to know anything more about the atrocities being committed in the former Yugoslavia before action is taken?

Improvements in venting systems and public warnings to consumers have resulted in a steady decline in carbon monoxide deaths in recent years. Still, more than 3,800 people will die from carbon monoxide exposure this year, and at least 10,000 others will be poisoned seriously enough to require medical attention or to miss a day or more of normal activities. Those who survive serious carbon monoxide poisoning can suffer brain damage causing memory problems, other intellectual impairments and personality changes like irritability, moodiness and aggressiveness.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Health"},{"date":"19921223","headline":"A General Says Armed Vehicles Will Be Seized on Sight in Somalia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/world/a-general-says-armed-vehicles-will-be-seized-on-sight-in-somalia.html","abstract":"  Expanding a campaign to rid Somalia of its heaviest weapons, United States forces will soon begin seizing armed vehicles wherever they are encountered, a senior American commander said today.
