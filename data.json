The baby fell to his death, and his 67-year-old grandmother was seriously hurt when she slipped from a firefighter's grasp and fell two stories while being lowered into a courtyard.   It was only a minor blaze in an old couch that broke out about 2:10 P.M. in a third floor hall of the building at 474 Brooklyn Avenue, near Sterling Street in Crown Heights, fire officials said. Flames destroyed the couch and damaged the walls but were quickly put out by firefighters using a fire extinguisher.

The high-speed train from Madrid follows the palm-fringed curve of a bay where Mediterranean meets Atlantic, then plunges along sand dunes onto a spit with nothing on all sides but wind spray. The first port of call, which the Phoenicians named Gadir, is now Cadiz, the very last stop in Spain. In this ultimate outpost groping toward Africa or the high seas, Western civilization as we know it whites out, ships out, shows its frayed edges. All solid ground gives way to shaky, seasick definitions.\n\nIs this just a stray bit of Morocco studded with Baroque churches? Or could languid Cadiz with its stolid mercaderes be a second cousin of Mexico's Veracruz? Does its mix of walled colonial ramparts, jungle foliage and underemployment suggest a family resemblance to San Juan? Are these cool and cobbled shopping streets, more stately than seedy chasms of 19th-century conceit, a faint preview of urban Peru? Don't the balmy alamedas, windowed-in wooden balcon overhangs and surprisingly grandiose plazas indicate that we're two hours from Havana instead of Sevilla? The fortunes, as well as the look, of Cadiz have long been linked with Spain's New World empire. Here, Columbus outfitted the caravel Nina. His ship the Santa Maria was named after Puerto de Santa Maria, the across-the-bay beach town and Jerez sherry warehouser reached by ferry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"Clamoring for a Little Quiet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-west-village-clamoring-for-a-little-quiet.html","abstract":"  Screaming car alarms, honking cabbies and raucous drunks are facts of city life.

Prostitution laws do not vary across county lines, but by walking a few blocks south into the Bronx, prostitutes enter an area where the court system is so crowded that often, instead of Westchester's 45-to-90-day terms, they serve only a two-day jail stay.

Yet when Teddy Kollek was elected mayor of Jerusalem in 1965, there was scarcely a single park or playground. After the city was united in 1967, he gathered an international committee of architects, landscape architects, writers and professors to establish guidelines for development. As a result, the greening of this ancient city has also preserved its character.   An ordinance requiring that all buildings be constructed of Jerusalem limestone -- a legacy of British rule -- is responsible for the mellow pinkish cast that unifies the cityscape. Regulations limiting the height of buildings (in certain areas they can be no more than eight stories) makes it possible to see the whole city from many vantage points as it swoops up and down the hillsides. One of the first tasks was to clear away the ramshackle housing leaning against the ancient walls and create a greenbelt around the Old City that gives it today, with its more than 30 grass-covered archeological sites, the biblical appearance of a city on an open plain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"Duke's Coach Hospitalized With Bad Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/sports/sports-people-college-basketball-duke-s-coach-hospitalized-with-bad-back.html","abstract":"  Duke Coach MIKE KRZYZEWSKI, hospitalized with back problems, was expected to miss last night's game between the No. 11 Blue Devils and No. 24 Georgia Tech in Atlanta.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/westchester-guide-972995.html","abstract":"  ANOTHER 'FANTASTICKS'   In May 1960 Jerry Orbach opened in \"The Fantasticks\" in a little theater far off Broadway on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village.

During a brief stay in the lull between Hanukkah and Christmas we ate well and variously at a range of prices, and did not begin to exhaust the choices, which included international gourmet and ethnic, offered by the archetypal cosmopolis. Although a certain lack of polish was occasionally evident, we suspected it was deliberate policy or the national ethic. (Want dancing waiters? Go to France.)   As might be expected, even gastronomy is not entirely free of politics -- for example, Israeli oenophiles are terrified of losing the vineyards of the Golan Heights -- but we were struck by the wonderful live-and-let-live ecumenism of the food scene. Practically the only style of cooking not represented -- small loss -- is the half-a-steamed-carrot approach of nouvelle cuisine, while \"creative cuisine\" here usually means kosher solutions for, among others, French, Italian, Chinese, Argentine, Indian, Ethiopian, Moroccan and Yemenite menus and, most recently, for a sushi bar.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"One-Liners, Even Groaners, Are the Rule at This Table","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/oneliners-even-groaners-are-the-rule-at-this-table.html","abstract":"BANTER is the order of the day when a group of artists, writers and their friends gather for their weekly round table in the back room of Nick's Restaurant in Danbury.

Danto has called Warhol's \"fool\" persona was an intelligence uncannily attuned to the Zeitgeist. When Warhol died in 1987, his legacy included a 27-room town house filled with fine art, furnishings, objets d'art and jewelry that generated a staggering $25.3 million when auctioned in 1988 at Sotheby's -- funds that subsequently would be used to create the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and later, with additional money from the Dia Center for the Arts and the Carnegie Institute, to establish a museum in Pittsburgh devoted solely to Warhol's work. THE ANDY WARHOL MUSEUM (The Andy Warhol Museum/Distributed Art Publishers, $40) is a record of this collective endeavor, filled with photographs from the extensive Warhol archives. It offers a grab bag of readings, from Mr. Danto's provocative essay exploring the philosophical underpinnings of Warhol's art to Helen Searing's long-winded architectural treatise on industrial conversions and the making of museums. In the most personal of these pieces, Bennard B. Perlman, a college friend, writes engagingly of Warhol's childhood and student years. His recollections of Warhol as a shy, physically awkward observer contrast sharply with the irreverent, ultra-hip art star and socialite of Warhol's New York years. More titillating though less revealing is the picture-album-cum-captions chronology that follows. Here we learn everything from the year Warhol underwent cosmetic surgery on his nose to the scoop on the \"50 Most Beautiful People\" party at Warhol's infamous studio, the Factory. A compact disk of 17 brief audio recordings also comes with the book. \"Andy taped thousands of hours of conversations, meetings, parties and dinners,\" reports the narrator, John Giorno, a poet who appeared in \"Sleep,\" Warhol's first movie. Perhaps this obsession with self-documentation explains why Warhol felt he had no need for memory and could glibly announce, \"My mind is like a tape recorder with one button -- erase.\" ANDREA BARNET","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"Congressional Memo; 73 Mr. Smiths, of the G.O.P., Go to Washington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/us/congressional-memo-73-mr-smiths-of-the-gop-go-to-washington.html","abstract":"  The seven House Republicans chosen by their party to summarize the accomplishments of the opening week of the 104th Congress for the press on Friday had a grand combined total of about 14 days in office.

Its coffeehouses, theaters and Pharaonic sites draw tens of thousands of visitors a year, many of whom go on to Upper Egypt to view the ancient monuments in Luxor and Aswan. This is the best time of the year to visit Cairo, when the city is cool and areas in the south warm.   Attacks by Muslim militants in the last two years have crippled tourism, which is only beginning to recover this season. A Government crackdown, which has included the execution of several militant leaders, has improved security in Cairo.  Tourists who visit the Pharaonic sites in Upper Egypt are widely urged to avoid Nile cruises that travel between Cairo and Luxor. The cruises between Luxor and Aswan are, however, considered secure.  Bus travel through villages and small towns is another mode of transport that is commonly targeted by militants.

For prospective home-exchangers, it's the time to read swap catalogues, with their cryptic entries, optimistically seeking a vine-covered cottage by the Avon in England to be exchanged for a split-level on Long Island.    Some searchers may hunch over the electronic fireside: A computer bulletin board for exchangers and renters, begun in November 1993, is so new it has only 200 or so listings, all but a handful in the United States. But access is free except for a toll call to Florida, which can be made at midnight, so there is little to lose. Targeting Teachers    Teacher Swap, now entering its ninth year, will publish its 1995 catalogue in March, plus two supplements after that. The proprietors, Ron and Ellie Frevola of Long Island, have a loose definition of teacher, encompassing active and retired, volunteer and paid, Sunday school and adult-education teachers. Mr. Frevola said the most important qualification is a long vacation making settling-in worthwhile, although some swappers offer long weekends.    People sending information who want the listing to appear in the directory that is distributed overseas should postmark the entry form by Jan. 20. If only a domestic exchange is sought, the deadline is Feb. 15. At the present pace of submissions, Mr. Frevola expects to have 700 listings in the year. Last year the main book had 34 pages with 538 entries: 225 from 32 states, 34 from Canada and 279 from 28 foreign countries, mostly in Europe.   The catalogue, which has telegraphic entries and no pictures, urges subscribers to try early and not give up the first year if they particularly want a house.    Mr. Frevola, asked about the possibility that people might come home to a damaged house, said that he had not heard of this from any exchangers among his 2,000 to 3,000 subscribers over eight years. A half-dozen complaints, none serious, had been received, he said.    Like the other publishers, Mr. Frevola said he got complaints about dirty dishes in the cupboard or car trunks that did not lock. The worst problem, he said, was created by three young teachers from France who loved their exchange with a Westchester teacher but left behind a $400 phone bill for calls to France. Mr. Frevola said his associate in France, Michel Barrere, called the three teachers and the bill was paid.    Typically, the Frevolas' catalogue disclaims \"all responsibility for a successful exchange of homes.\" It also says: \"All subscribers agree to indemnity and save harmless Teacher Swap Inc. of and from any and all liability for damages and injury to the person or property of another and against and from all suits and actions and all costs and damages resulting from the exchange of homes.\"   Those who want to be listed in the catalogue pay $42; those who want to browse but not be listed pay $50.    Teacher Swap, Box 454, Oakdale, L.I. 11769; (516) 244-2845. 7,000 Entries With Pictures    The Vacation Exchange Club, which began in 1960, published its 394-page January 1995 book last month. Karl Costabel, who bought the enterprise in 1991 from its founders, David and Mary Ostroff, says there are 7,000 entries, half with pictures. Two-thirds are in Europe; the rest are in North America, Mexico and Hawaii.   A listing, plus the five books for 1995, costs $65; it's $15 more to include a horizontal photo and $20 for a vertical. Listings for a second home cost $10 more. Information submitted by Jan. 14 will appear in the February book. Those subscribing now will get the January book. The catalogue pictures are not captioned, and unless one knows what sort of house to expect, it is not always clear whether the illustration goes with the entry above or below.    Paul G. Foldes, a lawyer in Arlington, Va., has subscribed since 1987. That year, Mr. Foldes said, he swapped his \"exec home minutes to DC tourist attactions by car, subway, ae, ac, apl, sa, tv, vcr, rr, bc, bi,\" meaning an auto exchange is possible and the house is air-conditioned, has all domestic appliances, sauna/Jacuzzi/hot tub, television, videocassette recorder, family room, balcony/deck/porch, and a bicycle. In return he got a house in upstate New York, which he and his companion and their children used as a base to see Niagara Falls, Toronto and other places.    The next exchange, he said, came in 1992, when he swapped for three weeks with a couple from Hawaii. He said that he was warned that Hawaii was in such demand he would not get anything for years. \"But we hit it right away,\" he said in an interview. \"A house on the beach at Waikiki.\" He is trying again, hoping for something in the San Francisco area.    Vacation Exchange Club, Box 650, Key West, Fla. 33041; (800) 638-3841. Link to 12 Groups    The Invented City, in business since 1991, publishes in March, June and November. In 1993 it linked up with 12 other exchange groups under the name International Home Exchange Association. The proprietor, Glenn London, said the active membership is 2,000, and the November supplement included 700 new listings. The deadline for getting into the March edition is Feb. 1. The fee for listing, or subscribing without listing, is $50.    This catalogue, which has no pictures, is easier to read than most: The entries are arrayed across the page instead of appearing in dense columns. The Invented City, 41 Sutter Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94104; (415) 673-0347. A Florida Sideline    The new one on the block is Home Exchange Network, a computer bulletin board service being operated as a sideline by a couple in Florida. This has been running a year. Because they do not yet have much to sell, the vendors, Daniel J. Rubin and his wife, Linda J. Allen, do not charge for membership. Any computer user with a modem can dial (407) 869-5956 and follow the instructions to sign on for a six-month free membership. The listings, one screen each, can be read immediately, and the instructions are easy, even for a bulletin board novice.    Mr. Rubin said most subscribers requested a form to list a house on the bulletin board rather than entering it directly into the computer. The entries may duplicate those in books; Mr. Foldes of Arlington has his house listed on this service, too.    Home Exchange Network, Box 951253, Longwood, Fla. 32791; (407) 862-7211.   The oldest of the groups, Intervac, was founded in 1951 and, with 9,400 subscribers worldwide, says it is the biggest. For a $65 fee, members receive three catalogues a year, published on Dec. 1, March 1 and May 1. Another catalogue is put out in June and is available for an extra $19. There is an $11 charge for including a photo of the property. Houses in 36 countries are listed, including North and Central America, western Europe, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The United States branch is run from San Francisco by Paula Jaffe and Lori Horne, who bought the business eight years ago.

Its word-of-mouth popularity with a mature, affluent-looking crowd makes it tough to get either a table or a parking space, even on slower weeknights.\n\nAfter tasting more than two dozen dishes on recent visits -- a cross section of the Italian-American menu -- we found that for every terrific dish, there was one that was not up to par. And that is what keeps the rating for this convivial, family-operated restaurant below its potential.\n\nPasta and seafood dishes are winners, while a few entrees, particularly veal preparations, leave something to be desired. Veal ortolana, for one, could be renamed veal Gucci, with its red and green salad topping and leathery breaded scaloppine. Portions are large, though, and the plate presentation is above average. Also, prices are not high. A complete dinner runs about $24, not counting tax, tip or wine. \n\nThe snug dining area was recently expanded to 85 seats by taking over the former deli's space next door, but the tables are still jammed. Despite being on time for our reservation recently, our fivesome was kept waiting in the tiny foyer for 35 minutes. Better management of the front of the house would help.\n\nOnce people are seated, the personable, bantering waiters in black tie keep things moving. The specials, though, are described accurately only about half of the time and never with prices.\n\nAmong the specials, two excellent choices that appear frequently are the rock shrimp appetizer -- succulent morsels crusty with herbs and spices and reminiscent of \"Cajun popcorn\" -- and pasta with Manila clams. In the latter, a shower of the steamed baby deep-sea clams with green-tinged shells, at once sweet and briny, are tossed with al dente linguine in a garlicky broth.\n\nA nice mix of young greens (misnamed \"Mesculine\" on the menu) in a good vinaigrette with shards of Parmesan outshines the dull Caesar salad, and tenderly plump escargots with shiitake mushrooms and toast points is a more successful combination than the one-note acidic brown sauce on sliced portobello mushrooms, which would be better left whole. Other starters include a trio of succulent shrimp with a tumble of white beans, and tortellini in brodo, meat-filled pasta afloat in a full-flavored broth.\n\nIn pollo balsamico, lightly sauteed chunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms are bathed in a very intense balsamic vinegar sauce. Penne, the quill-shape macaroni, tossed with sauteed eggplant cubes in a tomato and basil sauce with melted fontina cheese, is appealing.\n\n\nVegetables are included with most entrees, but a recommended side dish is the emerald-green spinach, only lightly sauteed, with a fragrant gloss of olive oil and cracklings of garlic.\n\nJoseph Meli, the chef who operates Primavera with his wife, Antonia, cooked at Il Tulipano in nearby Cedar Grove before going out on his own here three years ago.\n\nExcept for the de rigueur tiramisu, richly satisfying in a sundae dish, and the imported fruit sorbets in their natural shells, most of the desserts are brought in from a New York bakery. Although a cheesecake was leaden, a custardy profiterole cake drizzled with chocolate will suit the sweet tooth at the table. \n\nThe brief wine list contains a handful each of California, Italian and French bottles, like a Meridian chardonnay for $16 and a '91 Groth cabernet sauvignon for $26. There are off-list specials, like a 1988 Brunello di Montalcino for $40.\n Primavera \n\nGood \n\n500 Pleasant Valley Way, near Eagle Rock Avenue, West Orange. (201) 731-4779.\n\nAtmosphere: Pleasant and informal but cramped double storefront.\n\nRecommended dishes: Rock shrimp special, escargots with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp with white beans, mesclun salad, linguine with Manila clams, linguine Amedeo, penne with eggplant, sole with lemon sauce, spinach, tiramisu, profiterole cake, fruit sorbets.\n\nPrice range: At lunch, entrees, $6.95 to $11.95.

As the new movie \"I.Q.\" tells you, what really matters about Albert Einstein (played by Walter Matthau) is that he is a great little matchmaker, able to see at a glance that his brilliant mathematician niece, Catherine (Meg Ryan), is secretly pining for a local mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Ed is not a stupid guy, but he's no rocket scientist. In the lexicon of current American movies, Ed's lack of erudition is enough to hint that he's a decent man.    \"Forrest Gump\" is the most successful film to equate low I.Q. with inner goodness, but it has a lot of company on screen. In \"Nell,\" which David Letterman more accurately called \"Bride of Gump,\" Jodie Foster holds the moral high ground as a backwoods woman deprived of education and ordinary language.

Not Till Attitudes Change","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/sports/backtalk-sports-peace-in-our-time-not-till-attitudes-change.html","abstract":"  It is, perhaps, someday soon. A week from now, two weeks, a month, it is finally that unpostponable morning after that follows an unthinkable cancellation of the season. The exhilaration of those final frantic hours when, as owner or player, you stood proudly with your brethren and did what you had to do, is gone. Now it is done. Now nothing about hockey matters until September.   It is 5 years from now, or 10, and every year after that. You are a former player or owner, commissioner or executive director. You are a doer by nature; no thought sits long undirected in your mind, no feeling unchanneled, uncontrolled. But every time you see the line 1994-95 (No Season) you wince. You scramble and cover the wince, explaining to that holdout part of you why it happened, had to happen, how it was better that way, but you can never explain well enough. You see it; you wince.   Three days after, 5 or 10 years after, every year after that, was it worth it? Even remembering all the details of that time, everything that made you do what you did, but knowing the rest, too, would you still do it? Forget the effect on fans, sponsors, bottom lines and bank statements. Those you can argue any way you want. What about on you? How does it make you feel about you?   It is now. The owners, until yesterday, had been insisting on a salary cap or payroll tax. The players had refused. There was no common ground, \"no basis for agreement.\" Everybody was doing his job. Gary Bettman's was to get labor peace for the owners under a formula in which player salaries rise less precipitously. Bob Goodenow's was to build a player union strong and unified enough to resist, to allow the market to take salaries where they go. The problem needed only a nudge to start. Whose push turned to whose shove didn't matter. As with most strikes and lockouts, both sides wanted a fight.   Now, in light of yesterday's new offer by the owners, the question is: Do the two sides finally want to stop?   Issues don't divide, attitudes do. A partly cloudy day is mostly sunny if you decide to see it that way. When there is a will for war, fighting happens. When there is a will for peace, it stops. What can turn hockey's will for division into a will for agreement?   The fans have been remarkably patient. Supposedly passionate about their game and teams, they have done little picketing, issued few threats of future boycott. Perhaps it is because settlement (to them) has always seemed imminent; perhaps because for so long, the alternative game has seemed almost as exciting. Showdown meetings, team player against team owner, expressions of solidarity, not much that had \"Play of the Day\" potential, but something to talk about.   Yet the fans have been patient because they know their place. Players and owners can choose to play, or not play. The power is in their hands, and fans know that. They do not like it, but it's a power they respect. And between the fans, the players and the owners, some unexpressed bargain seems to have been struck. How much of a season you give me, a fan says, is your right. That you give me a season, is mine. Not because I have any power over that, but because it is right. Break the bargain, break the patience.   A sport seems unimaginably important during the early days of a strike or lockout. As days pass, it becomes clear how much greater fantasy is to any reality. Life does go on. Call the bluff, and you may get an answer you don't want to hear. What we always assumed was passion may have only been habit.   But the will to agreement needs a way, and the players and owners, until now, have found none. It may be they have been looking in the wrong place. They want to put this unrelenting squabbling behind them. They're tired, the fans are tired. Everyone needs to get on with it. Always fighting over who gets what share of the pie, they need peace to grow that pie. Years of it! But what is the formula, appropriate now, flexible enough to apply to all the changes of later, that both sides can live with? Basketball thought it had one; now its players don't think so, and they play the N.B.A. season looking for something new. Football and baseball are looking, too.   It's not there! That's the message of the length and vehemence of the baseball and hockey labor disputes.  History is moving in the players' direction; the owners want to stop the clock. For them, the future seems an impossibly difficult place. Next year is one thing; two, three, four years from now, they can see where the players are going and they can't see how they can get there themselves. But history isn't lived in four-year chunks. Today, you manage; tomorrow, you find a way. And tomorrow after that. There is no way that every baseball team in 1975 could survive this free agency era that has followed, and yet every team has.   The business of sport is changing too rapidly. The formula as solution is an illusion. Long-term interests, from the perspective of now, are too divided. If the search for formula continues through negotiation and seasons await the outcome, there will be no seasons. There isn't one team that can't survive until next year. Focus on four-year deals to put trouble behind you, and you put nothing but trouble in front of you. A four, five or six-year focus turns things ideological, hypothetical, rhetorical, makes the possible impossible. Yesterday's formula was power, and the owners had it. Now in all sports, there is a growing balance. It is hard to break the other guy, bring him to your way of thinking unless it is his way of thinking, too.   Deciding there must be either peace or war is disastrous. There is nothing wrong with muddling along. Maybe there will come a time when more is possible. If not, the parties still will have survived, the games will be played. And muddling along also forces players and owners to muddle together. In time, perhaps they will come to understand, trust, respect and get respect back, to work together and produce through the back door what neither side would tolerate through the front -- some form of cooperation.   It was time to fight; now, it's time to play. Time for Gary Bettman's and Bob Goodenow's job to be defined differently so that success for each is measured in a season played, in the 1995 Stanley Cup being won. So that neither side forces the other to carry the can of a bad deal, days and years later, having to wince even harder at that. Great performers in any activity have a sense of timing. Now, they realize, is when the game is being won and lost, now is when the big hit must be made, the goal must be scored. Now is when the deal must be done.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"The Prices Are Down and Business Is Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/dining-out-the-prices-are-down-and-business-is-up.html","abstract":"  NOW you see it, now you don't.

Nevertheless, he is instructed to field his players, who will now be augmented by Penn State's basketball team, the chess club, the criminology department and the university's fund-raising division. Furthermore, his goal will no longer be to defeat his opponent but, with as little physical contact as possible, to establish a rapport with the Oregon Ducks and ultimately persuade them either to give up or to join his own team.\n\nThe analogy is helpful in trying to understand the U.S. military's task in Haiti after Jimmy Carter's diplomatic brinkmanship in September threw a year's worth of Pentagon plans into disarray. From the beginning, the U.S. occupation forces have struggled to focus simultaneously on two Haitis, with two distinct sets of tactical and indeed philosophical challenges. And if one lesson has emerged from the occupation, it is this: in the post-cold-war world of small, messy conflicts, the U.S. Army might as well leave the infantry at home.

Mr. Yeltsin's mishandling of the Chechen rebellion is sure to strengthen those who want to end American assistance and return to a strategy of containing rather than befriending Russia. That would be a mistake, but some recalibration of long-term American policy is warranted.   Recognizing that the brutality of the attack has undermined Mr. Yeltsin, President Clinton has urged him to end the killing of civilians and accept an offer from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help mediate a political settlement. Moscow should not refuse. Belatedly, Mr. Yeltsin says he is trying to put the military on a tighter leash and end the indiscriminate bombing of Grozny, the Chechen capital.

Partisans of the composer will claim that its continuing though not quite total neglect is the result of either malignity or ignorance. But the piece has limitations, as Copland himself recognized. He always insisted it was not a manifesto for American opera but rather a modest vehicle for student singers and small companies. So the adventurous Bronx Opera Company's modest but handsome production, seen on Saturday night in the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, was pleasingly apt.    Intended for television rather than the live stage, \"The Tender Land\" drew inspiration from Walker Evans's stark, gritty photographs from the 1930's. Erik Johns's libretto, depicting the brief love affair between a drifter, Martin, and a farm girl, Laurie, rebelling against her tight-knit family, aims to celebrate the prairie experience and also expose its confining social roles. Very little actually happens, but Copland was up to the task of carrying the audience along with stretches of tone painting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950109","headline":"A Meditation on Death With Drums and Gongs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/arts/music-review-a-meditation-on-death-with-drums-and-gongs.html","abstract":"  For nearly four minutes on Friday night, the audience in Avery Fisher Hall stood and cheered a composition's world premiere: not a standard response in contemporary musical life. At least some of the enthusiasm for Joseph Schwantner's half-hour Concerto for Percussion and Orchestra could be attributed to the fact that the composition had none of the medicinal quality audiences have long associated with new music. Despite the potentially aggressive character suggested by its title, it lacked any desire to shock or assault or sound \"advanced.\"    Moreover, the New York Philharmonic, which commissioned the work, was in top form. The soloist, Christopher Lamb, for whom it was written, was a virtuoso at turning accent and meter into shape and gesture. Leonard Slatkin, who has long championed Mr. Schwantner's music, gave this work as authoritative and committed a reading as it is likely to have.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950109","headline":"Stalling on Social Security Makes a Worse Mess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/opinion/l-stalling-on-social-security-makes-a-worse-mess-217395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In your Jan. 3 article on House Speaker Newt Gingrich's views on Social Security reform you quote from a C-Span interview in which he acknowledged that the Social Security program will need adjustments to remain solvent and prevent larger budget deficits.
