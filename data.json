These extensions represent a considerable coup for the director of the museum, Vladimir Gusev. Mr. Gusev had two very important things going for him: One was the backing of the strong-willed Mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak.

The Navy's case for carriers rests on three questionable premises: first, that it has to maintain a permanent presence around the globe; second, that it needs carrier battle groups with a full complement of escort ships to establish that presence; and third, that those carrier battle groups must be modernized at the same pace they were during the cold war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930821","headline":"SPORTS PEOPLE: FOOTBALL;","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/21/sports/sports-people-football.html","abstract":"  JEFF GEORGE, the Indianapolis Colts' disgruntled quarterback, will finally report to work and will pay $144,000 in fines for missing practice, the team said yesterday. \"The most important thing is to win,\" Coach TED MARCHIBRODA said. \"If we can do that, I think most of this will be forgotten.\"   George will be paid for last night's game against the Los Angeles Raiders, a check worth $111,000, but will still owe the $144,000 in fines accumulated in the month he's been out of camp.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19930821","headline":"NASA loses contact with the Mars Observer spacecraft.","pages":[{"title":"NASA","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA","description":"American space and aeronautics agency","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg/320px-NASA_logo.svg.png","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":268},"abstract":"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.

Even with the pound devalued, cashmere sweaters are still stunningly expensive, and a skirt-length of Harris tweed or Scotch tartan might, for a cost-conscious tourist, involve giving up a long-awaited tea at the Dorchester. (And who do you know who wants a tartan skirt?) Most of the fairly inexpensive trinkets at street stands -- little soldiers in tall fur hats, miniature British flags, dish towels depicting the Tower of London, smart-alecky T-shirts -- are either flimsy or tacky, or both. So what can a traveler on a limited budget find?   Plenty -- not behind the quaint pseudo-Tudor storefront of Liberty's, but in mundane, well-stocked supermarkets such as Sainsbury, Safeway, Gateway, Tesco, Wait rose or Asda. Although London and country towns still abound in small shops, the fruiterer, butcher and baker are hard-pressed by American-style chains, some so ambitious they even include hardware sections, fast-food counters and children's play areas. Inside these emporiums of food and drink, and even in some smaller grocery stores, a souvenir hunter can quickly fill a cart with distinctive reminders of England that cost only a few dollars or less. Since many American supermarkets (and specialty shops in metropolitan areas) carry selected English imports -- After Eight mints, for example, Carr's Water Biscuits, Twining's Earl Grey tea, or Baxter's Orange Marmalade -- I avoid such obvious choices. Many other possibilities await, however, including less ordinary variations on familiar themes: Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade (orange, lemon and grapefruit, $1.70, or Hovis Butter Puffs, 75 cents, or Mint Humbugs, $1, calculated at $1.44 to the pound.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"SAUDI STABILITY HIT BY HEAVY SPENDING OVER LAST DECADE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/world/saudi-stability-hit-by-heavy-spending-over-last-decade.html","abstract":"  Saudi Arabia, long seen as one of the world's wealthiest countries, has undermined its financial stability with a decade of unrestrained spending, huge military purchases and irregular banking practices.

The catalogue for the survey of Renger-Patzsch's work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (through Sept. 26) points out that the book was given this title by its publisher, Kurt Wolff; Renger-Patzsch himself wanted to call it simply \"Die Dinge\" (\"Things\").

Certainly, many places here have more grace, more age, more harmony than the Palace of Topkapi and its mesh of pavilions and styles.    But there is no single site that has as much to tell us about the values, tastes and aspirations of the Ottoman Empire, which kept its headquarters here for 400 of its more than 600-year reign. The Saray was more than the residence of the reigning Sultan and his court -- his women and slaves, grand viziers and eunuchs, teachers and executioners. This was the center of power. Taxes and tributes poured into Topkapi from an empire that extended from Ethiopia to Central Asia and to Bosnia. Records were kept here, heads rolled here and orders were carried far and wide. After Sultan Selim I assumed the title of Caliph in the early 16th century, these precincts even became a kind of Vatican of the Muslim world. And over the centuries, Topkapi swelled with gifts, adornments and war booty.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/q-and-a-745293.html","abstract":"    Cruise Line Hosts","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Britain's Spy Agencies Begin To Come Out From the Cold","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/world/britain-s-spy-agencies-begin-to-come-out-from-the-cold.html","abstract":"  In the 20 months since she was named the chief of M.I.5, Britain's domestic security service, Stella Rimington has rung up several firsts: She is the first woman to head one of Britain's secret agencies, the first M.I.5 director to appear before cameras at a news conference, the first British intelligence chief to publish a booklet disclosing the organization's goals and staffing, and the first person from the secret world ever to have her photograph appear in a gossip magazine.

In this century, the bare midriff reappeared in the 1930's strictly for beach wear, and it has been in and out of fashion ever since. It is now an everyday sight on Fifth Avenue. Young women are teaming minuscule tops with hip-huggers that expose the navel or with skirts whose waistbands hit just above the navel, although they can also take a stylish dip below it. The exposure can be anywhere from a few inches to a foot deep. For some young women, the effect is achieved by tying a common T-shirt into a front knot (lower far right). One of the most creative looks (left of the T-shirt) combines a sleeveless, transparent net overdress that veils the wearer from the neck to the ankle.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"In Torrington, Spicy Subcontinental Fare","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/nyregion/dining-out-in-torrington-spicy-subcontinental-fare.html","abstract":"  INDIAN restaurants are so rare in Connecticut that discovering Indo-Bangla in Torrington comes as a treat for any fan of the hot, well-spiced food of the subcontinent.

This is not a biography of Austen, Nigel Nicolson explains, but an attempt to help us see the world that she saw. Nonetheless, Mr. Nicolson, who is best known as the biographer of his parents, Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, presents an engaging introduction to Austen's life, as well as a portrait of the architectural styles and taste of the age, engagingly illustrated by Stephen Colover's photographs. Moreover, in guiding us through the houses, estates and landscapes that Austen knew in Kent, Hampshire, Bath and a variety of seaside resorts, Mr. Nicolson succeeds in his purpose of considering her novels \"as a product of her experience.\" Austen (1775-1817) was the daughter of a parson of modest means who nonetheless had frequent social contacts with families on all levels of the social scale, including the nobility. Mr. Nicolson chronicles the Austen family's moves from one part of the country to another, along with Jane's frequent visits to nearby friends and relatives, and describes the ways in which her novels and letters reveal her preference for country over urban life and classical architectural styles over the ornate and romantic. Wisely, he refrains from claiming specific homes as models for any of the fictional residences in Austen's novels, pointing out that they were composites of her imagination's making. Mr. Nicolson, who lives in Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, displays a keen critical eye for architecture and design and a respectful appreciation for Austen's art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Frequent Flier","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/l-frequent-flier-306493.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Adam Bryant's \"Frequent Flying for Dilettantes\" (Aug. 1) discusses some strategies for accumulating credit in frequent flier programs, but fails to point out what a waste of time the entire procedure can be.

Now Bjork (who doesn't use her last name, Gutmundsdottir) has gone solo, as some devotees always felt she should. In recent interviews, the 27-year-old singer has professed that she never much cared for the alternative-rock qualities of the Sugarcubes' music. With \"Debut\" (Elektra, 9 61468-2; CD and cassette), she set out to combine her love of jazz with her ardor for rave music. To this end, she hooked up with Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul, who produced most of the album and co-wrote five of the 11 songs. Mr. Hooper's rhythmic expertise provides the kind of groovy settings Bjork's voice has always deserved. The collaboration has proved effective; the album is rapidly climbing Billboard's pop chart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"At SUNY Purchase, 'The Trip to Bountiful'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/nyregion/theater-at-suny-purchase-the-trip-to-bountiful.html","abstract":"  NOTHING much happens in \"The Trip to Bountiful,\" only that a woman replenishes her soul. Mrs. Carrie Watts, cooped up in a two-room Houston apartment with a wimpy son (Ludie) and a pestering, thoroughly unpleasant daughter-in-law (Jessie Mae), dreams of returning to Bountiful, her hometown, once more before dying.

But for Carrie it will be enough to look at her house, what's left of it, to smell the ocean breeze that wafts from the Gulf and to put her hands in the soil.

His stepdaughter, Cecile Maistre, was scurrying around as assistant director. His third wife, Aurore, was in charge of the script.

And, of course, there was Mr. Chabrol himself, jovial as ever, puffing away at his pipe, presiding over the scene like a benevolent squire.   Not that he makes relaxed films. His 45th, \"Betty,\" which opened in New York on Friday, is the tale of a wife and mother, played by Marie Trintignant, who tumbles into alcoholism and disgrace after being chased from her home in Paris for infidelity. His 46th movie, which has yet to be released in the United States, was about the Vichy regime's collaboration with Nazi Germany. The film he is now shooting is also no sidesplitter.

The free concert is at 8:30 in Heckscher Park (271-8442). Also tomorrow at the Stephen Talkhouse on Main Street in Amagansett, Kris Kristofferson will give performances at 8 and 10 P.M. (267-3117).\n\nTony Bennett, backed by the Count Basie Orchestra, begins a three-day, three-performance gig Tuesday at the Westbury Music Fair. Each concert is at 8 P.M. (334-0800). Also, Tom Jones makes his annual visit to the Music Fair with shows on Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. and next Sunday at 7.\n\nOn Saturday, Michael Feinstein, the pianist-singer, will be at Planting Fields in Oyster Bay at 8 P.M., performing under the banner of the Friends of the Arts (922-0061).\n\nMike Nichols does not sing or even do comedy anymore. But the veteran director does talk, and talk he will on Tuesday at 8 P.M. when he offers a \"Master Lecture\" at the Bay Street Theater Festival in Sag Harbor (725-1108).\nTALL IN THE SADDLE\n\n With more than 150 entries competing in some 60 pleasure, hunter and equitation classes, the lineup at today's fifth annual Nassau Suffolk Horseman's Association Show is packed with potential. The traditional three-ring event is from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. at the Fairgrounds at Old Bethpage Village Restoration on Round Swamp Road (572-8400).\n\nAnother kind of competitive riding, but this time western style, will be featured Saturday, when the Long Island Horsemen's Association holds its Eastern Gymkhana Show. Attracting more than 200 horses and their riders, the event will earn the winners points toward regional titles. The show begins at 6:30 P.M. at the Suffolk County Farm and Education Center in Yaphank and will be preceded by a country-music concert by The Fugitives at 4. (852-4605).\n'CHASING SHADOWS'\n\n During her childhood, Naomi Gryn's father, Hugo, a Conservative rabbi in London, used to tell her stories about growing up in Berehovo in Carpathia, then Czechoslovakia, but later in the Soviet Union. The stories always ended with the inevitable: the Jews who made up half the town's population were shipped to the crematorium at Birkenau.\n\nNow a film maker, Ms. Gryn accompanied her father back to his hometown a few years ago. \"Chasing Shadows\" is the documentary account of that journey. Along with Rabbi Gryn's recollections, it features rare footage of Carpathian Jewish farmers, newsreels of Hungarian troops \"liberating\" Berehovo and the only known film of the selection process at Birkenau. \n\nThe movie will be shown Tuesday at 1 and 8 P.M. at the Peninsula Library on Broadway in Lawrence (239-3262).\nRECALLING 1928 BERLIN\n\n The elegant world of music and dance that flourished in Berlin, circa 1928, comes to Bellport on Wednesday, when the Gateway Playhouse presents the fifth of its six musicals this summer. This time it is \"Grand Hotel,\" the Tony Award-winning tableau set in an elite hotel.\n\nThe musical will run through Sept. 12 and will be performed at 8:30 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays, 5 and 7 P.M. on Saturdays, 2 P.M. Thursdays and next Sunday and 7 P.M. on Sundays. The Gateway is on South Country Road (286-1133).\nPLAYING SCOTTISH\n\n You do not have to be Scottish to enjoy the games scheduled for Saturday at Old Westbury Gardens. It might help, however, to have more than a fleeting knowledge of \"ye tossing of ye bar,\" or caber tossing; \"clachneart,\" or putting the stone, and \"tossing the sheaf.\" These are three of the games to be played from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.\n\nIn addition to the actual games, sponsored by the Long Island Scottish Clan, there will be music by bagpipes, some provided by the F.B.I. Irish Band; the Highland Fling and Sword Dance, performed by the Nassau Scottish Country Dancers; a demonstration of sheep dogs at work and an exhibition of historic battle swords.\n\nThe Gardens are on Old Westbury Road (333-0048).\nCELEBRATING FAMILIES\n\n Family togetherness is on tap Saturday and next Sunday at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor, at least enough togetherness to divert youngsters and their parents at the museum's annual Family Festival. \n\nBesides viewing the current exhibition, \"Long Island Collections: The Gilded Age to the 1990's\" and a juried arts and crafts show, those attending will get to visit a petting zoo, enjoy carnival and pony rides, hear live music and sample international foods.\n\nThe festival is from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. each day at the museum off Northern Boulevard. Admission is $5 a car (484-9338). \nCELEBRATING EARTH\n\n Environmentalists on the East End take their role seriously, so seriously that they have scheduled a 10-day Green Earth Festival to celebrate their successes in preserving the natural beauty and ecology of the South Fork. \n\nThe free festival, mostly at Ashawagh Hall on Fireplace Road in the Springs section of East Hampton, begins Saturday with the opening of an exhibition and sale of antique quilts and the display of the South Fork Natural History Society Quilt, designed and made by local quilters, and the start of \"Imagine Ourselves Richly,\" an ongoing art project for children and adults. The exhibitions can be seen from noon to 6 P.M. daily.\n\nThat first day also brings \"Design for a Green World,\" a panel discussion about environmentally sound architecture, at 10 A.M.; \"Thoreau and Friends,\" readings by the actors Dan Snow and Brooke Johnson, at 4 P.M., and the screening of the film \"Mindwalk\" at 9 P.M.\n\nThroughout the festival will be sessions devoted to subjects like \"Holistic Architecture\" and \"Art and the Environment: The Artist as Visionary,\" both next Sunday; walks and field trips and off-site panels on \"Forever Wild: Preserving Our Pine Barrens,\" Aug. 31 at LTV Studios in Wainscott, and \"What's Next? A Blueprint for the Future\" at the Southampton Campus of Long Island University, Sept. 1.

If the new tenants refuse to vacate at the termination of their two-month sublease is there anything I can do short of a protracted and expensive suit? . . . Marvin Sochet, Manhattan Answer: Maybe. According to Barry Werbin, a Manhattan lawyer, if the subtenants refuse to vacate the apartment your only option may be to proceed with litigation.   Eviction, however, can be accomplished by way of a summary proceeding, which, in many cases, according to Mr. Werbin, is not terribly protracted or overwhelmingly expensive.   Mr. Werbin added that you should not take matters into your own hands by changing the locks or in any way trying to take back your apartment. If you do, he said, you may expose yourself to a lawsuit from your sub-tenants.   Even though there is no written sublease or agreement, Mr. Werbin noted that the subtenants, by virtue of their occupancy of the apartment for more than 30 days, have what is, in effect, a month-to-month lease and an oral contract. Reserve-Fund Assessment Question: My Brooklyn co-op apartment building has recently been assessed for $150,000 to build up our reserve fund, which was depleted after some capital improvements.   I know assessments for capital improvements are within the board's province, but is is legal for them to assess us just to have a larger reserve fund with no capital improvements pending? . . . Leonard J. Katz, Brooklyn Answer: Yes. According to Carl Schwartz, a Manhattan lawyer, typically, proprietary leases permit a co-op's board of directors to assess shareholders for all of the cash requirements of the corporation.   Cash requirements, Mr. Schwartz added, usually include any so-called \"cash on hand\" that the co-operative's board of directors determines to be necessary and proper. Loan on 5-Unit Building Question: My home is a unit in a five-unit building, which I own. There is no mortgage on the property at present, but it seems to be impossible to secure a home equity line of credit or a mortgage.   The only thing I have found is a very limited mortgage through the Chase Development Corporation.   Bank, credit-union and saving-institution loan officers have told me that the building can only contain four units to qualify for the home equity line of credit or a regular mortgage.   Is this true? Why is this? . . . Constancia Romilly, Manhattan Answer: Yes. According to Margaret Scott, president of the Mortgage Advisory Service, a mortgage broker in Manhattan, lenders generally won't grant home equity lines of credit or make residential mortgages on properties with more than four units.   She said that the four-units guideline has been adopted by most lenders because that is the standard set by Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, a quasi-governmental agency that is the primary buyer of mortgages in the secondary market. Incidentially, Ms. Scott noted, home equity lines of credit are, in essence, nothing more than new mortgages.   Ms. Scott also said that you would might be eligible to apply for commercial loan. This kind of loan, however, would almost always carry a higher interest rate and take longer to process.   Moreover, the income qualification will also be based on your rental income from the units, not your own income.   \"It is a major problem that I deal with,\" Ms. Scott said. \"It is too bad that more lenders won't finance five-unit houses.   \"There used to be a few lenders that used to do that,\" she added. \"But as things have tightened up, they no longer will.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Susan H.

He had become a danger to the Mayor's re-election campaign. But Mr. Michael's questionable conduct is hardly the sum total of what went wrong at City Hall as it tried to privatize most operations of the Parking Violations Bureau.   As the report by the Department of Investigation so amply demonstrates, the city's effort was sloppy and amateurish at best, unethical and riddled with cronyism at worst. Although there are troubling implications, so far there is no evidence of criminality. But once again, the Mayor has seemed able to bestir himself only when licked by the flames of crisis.

The tours, developed by the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, are all centered around the Castle Dracula, a modern hotel, built on the edge of the Borgo Pass. Highlights include visits to historic castles and monasteries and a heavy dollop of theatricality: masked balls, twilight visits to cemeteries, and \"diplomas\" certifying participants have survived their encounter with the Count. The society also emphasizes the folklore around the Dracula legend. Tours, which range from about $300 to $1,000 a person for 4 to 15 days, including bus and plane transport from Bucharest are custom designed and may be scheduled for any time. Group size is flexible. For more information contact Bravo Tours in Bucharest, Romania, at (40-1) 312-5439. That number is also the fax number.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930822","headline":"Adena R.

But as law-enforcement authorities have focused their attention on stopping more boats from landing, many smugglers have turned to airplanes as their favored route of passage, and have developed new schemes to camouflage the small groups that arrive by plane each day. A1.  EMPIRE TRIES AGAIN ON MANAGED CARE  As Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield sets off on an ambitious plan to reduce costs by limiting the choice of doctors and medical care for millions of customers, company officials acknowledge that their previous foray into managed care has not been successful. But they say that they have corrected many of their problems and are working hard on the rest. B5. NEW YORK CITY RETIREES HEAD BACK TO NEW YORK  Despite the fear of crime, grime and hassles in the city that never sleeps, experts say a growing number of retirees are bucking decades-old migration patterns by moving to New York for its quality of life. Older and sicker than when they left, they have returned to be closer to family and for the city's plentiful services. The retirement migration has contributed at least in part to an explosion in the city's elderly population, officials say. A1. SEARCHING FOR A KILLER AND A MOTIVE  In the tense neighborhoods of Crown Heights and Brownsville, the police are searching for a man who has killed four people and critically wounded two more. Investigators say they are not able to determine either the motive or determine how the gunman chose his victims. All they have been able to do is establish, through ballistics tests, that the same 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol was used in the shootings, which began Aug. 12. In most cases, the victims were left with their valuables. The killer, the police said, simply walked up to his victims and began to shoot. B2. QUESTIONS FOR THE BUDGET DIRECTOR  He still does not get it. Philip R. Michael was forced to resign as the New York City Budget Director after investigators concluded that he had shown favoritism towards a company trying to win a city contract. Mr. Michael maintains that he did nothing improper and makes no apologies for his efforts to balance the city budget. But the report on the Department of Investigation's five-month inquiry raises questions about his judgment and the appearance of impropriety. Metro Matters, B3.

The owner and other downtown merchants say that nothing has disrupted business as much as the city's $24 million redevelopment project. Last year downtown streets were impassable for more than six months. This year the city has torn them up again. B5.

Now New York State will be losing its only existing disposal site for low-level nuclear waste, renewing talk of placing the new dump here, and rekindling old resentments among townspeople. B5.

Now under the direction of John Alleyne, the company has maintained a daring goal for so young a troupe: to present only modern ballet choreography, with a little modern dance, choreographed after 1975. Unsurprisingly, the company style is equal parts nerve and restrained theatricality, the latter a quality that, coupled with careful classical training, recalls Mr. Alleyne's formative years as a dancer and choreographer with the National Ballet of Canada and the Stuttgart Ballet.    The troupe's 18 dancers display a physical abandon that never loses sight of good ballet manners. It is an odd combination that worked well in Mr. Alleyne's 1990 \"Go Slow, Walter,\" the highlight of a program that was repeated through Saturday. The piece gets off to a striking start with its brilliant yellow set and costumes and its score, John Cage's invigorating, rollicking Three Dances for Two Prepared Pianos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930823","headline":"Review/Music; Cecilia Bartoli Sings A Survey of Mozart, And a Pinch of Rossini","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/arts/review-music-cecilia-bartoli-sings-a-survey-of-mozart-and-a-pinch-of-rossini.html","abstract":"  The 26th Mostly Mozart Festival ended on Saturday evening, and with a flair for showmanship otherwise rarely evident in this year's seven-jweek series, Lincoln Center saved its biggest drawing card for last. The soloist was Cecilia Bartoli, the 27-year-old Italian mezzo-soprano who in the last few years has become the opera world's darling, and not without reason. Her performances in New York have been uncommonly musical, and she has the stage presence to make arias and songs the self-contained dramas they ought to be. What's more, Mostly Mozart can claim her as a trophy, having presented her American debut in 1990.    Miss Bartoli's contributions to the program were Mozart's \"Exsultate, jubilate,\" \"Lungi le cure ingrate\" from \"Davidde Penitente,\" and \"Parto, parto,\" from \"La Clemenza di Tito.\" She added a couple of fiery Rossini arias as encores: \"Tanti affetti\" from \"La Donna del Lago,\" and \"Una voce poco fa\" from \"Il Barbiere di Siviglia.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930823","headline":"Conquering the Rift on Puerto Rico; Mainland Residents Stung by Exclusion From Vote on Island","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/nyregion/conquering-rift-puerto-rico-mainland-residents-stung-exclusion-vote-island.html","abstract":"  For many years Puerto Rico's leaders paid but passing attention to people of Puerto Rican descent living on the mainland, making a few courtesy calls and campaign stops in the Northeast.

The Jets' running backs averaged 4.1 yards per carry in Saturday night's 14-13 loss to the Giants, and the starting offensive line controlled the line of scrimmage. Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason was sacked just once in two and a half quarters of play. Heading into their final preseason game, in Washington on Friday, the Jets are averaging 4.7 yards per carry. Meanwhile, Esiason, who threw 7 of his 14 completions to wide receivers Saturday night, is trying to get the wideouts involved.   \"Last night, on a couple of plays, I'm thinking a guy is going one way and he's going another,\" said Esiason, who was 12 for 24 over all for 129 yards but no touchdowns. \"It's just a matter of seeing the reads and learning the reads and getting comfortable with one another. Hopefully, as time goes on we'll all be able to do it. I'm talking about tight ends and wide receivers down the field.

Johnny Johnson and Blair Thomas, who are competing for the starting running-back job, are averaging 5 yards a carry.

But with the growing demands of science, the metric system has been gradually shorn of nearly all its formerly simple definitions. In the next several years, even the humble kilogram, the last metric unit of measurement based on an object made by human beings, may be redefined in the daunting language of quantum mechanics. Never a Horse in Horsepower    The reason for the assault on the system created in the Age of Reason is an ever-increasing need for precision, say the scientists who are redefining the world's measurement standards.

Empire's existing foray into so-called managed-care plans, the health maintenance organization Healthnet, has lost $115 million over the last six years because, as even Empire officials concede, it was too hastily conceived, often provided poor service and had troubled relationships with its doctors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930823","headline":"What They're Reading","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"Manuel H.

But last week, after President Clinton's initial sales pitch for his plan-in-progress, his proposal that all employers be required to pay for health coverage emerged as one of the most fiercely contested aspects.   The employer mandate, as it is known, presents Mr. Clinton with a dilemma. This President certainly does not want to harm the hundreds of thousands of small-business owners who say, with backing from economists, that the proposal would cause job losses and bankruptcies. And he hardly wants to hand the Republicans a convenient club for attacking his proposals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930823","headline":"Review/Performance Art; Macho Woman Parodies A Man of Pop Anthems","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/arts/review-performance-art-macho-woman-parodies-a-man-of-pop-anthems.html","abstract":"  When Neil Diamond released his popular concert album \"Hot August Night\" 21 years ago, who would have foreseen that two decades later a self-proclaimed \"all-American Jewish lesbian folk singer\" would dress up like Mr. Diamond and parody his macho style to the delight of a New York avant-garde audience?    That is exactly what Phranc (pronounced frank), a thirtysomething folk singer who has released three albums on Island Records, is doing at Dance Theater Workshop in her show \"Hot August Phranc.\" Wearing a man's wig and a glittering silver shirt unbuttoned to reveal a forest of fake chest hair, Phranc offers a brilliantly funny impersonation of the singer whom she calls \"The Great One\" (Mr. Diamond's name is never actually mentioned).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930823","headline":"A Governor's Brave Stand on Illegal Aliens","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/opinion/a-governors-brave-stand-on-illegal-aliens.html","abstract":"Gov. Pete Wilson of California recently made reasonable recommendations for Federal action to help stem the flow of illegal immigration to the U.S. His critics tried to derail the discussion by denouncing his plans as nativist and insensitive. But his proposals, and the many other ideas for reducing the heavy social service burden on state budgets, deserve to be openly debated. Millions of people are in the U.S. in violation of the law. We must treat them humanely, but that does not mean we should allow them to stay. \n\nDespite the critics' outcry, there is popular demand that illegal immigration be stopped. Polls show that 80 to 90 percent of Americans -- black, Hispanic, white and Asian -- favor tighter policies. Politicians are taking heed: liberals and conservatives admit that the burden of the illegals is too heavy, in education, health and welfare benefits, and can no longer be tolerated.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930823","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/23/nyregion/news-summary-452193.html","abstract":"  International A2-7  SAUDI PROBLEMS AFFECT U.S.  The U.S. has been encouraging financially strapped Saudi Arabia to keep buying U.S. arms, but some Western analysts worry that this will cut other spending that has created domestic stability.
