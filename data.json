Running the gamut from Haydn's Fantasy in C to Brahms's Opus 116 Fantasies, the program demonstrated the imaginative vitality and also the technical discipline of the form.   Ms. Rich favors a highly emotive approach, somewhat mannered at times. Her habit of rolling chords proved periodically distracting. The Brahms Fantasies suffered from an excess of rubato and an occasional lack of rhythmic clarity. While her technique was not effortless, she articulated the subtlest of dynamic shadings and showed an uncanny ability to elucidate harmonic movement.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930505","headline":"Allen-Farrow Trial Ends in New Round of Old Charges","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/05/nyregion/allen-farrow-trial-ends-in-new-round-of-old-charges.html","abstract":"  It was, from start to finish, a trial of extraordinary acrimony, a bitter confrontation between two famous New Yorkers for all the world to witness.

Half buried in its electronic moans and swirls lay the tinny recorded voice of Mayakovsky himself, deliberately muffled and distorted and offering the impression of a suppressed personality wanting to be let out.   In much the same way, Mayakovsky's presence on Friday at Lehman College in the Bronx was more or less muffled by another Russian poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who for several hours ate up the stage with extroverted poetry readings (mostly poems by Mr. Yevtushenko), loud asides and athletic, audience-milking shtick. Through the haze of bombast, traces of Mayakovsky's striking imagination did seep into view. The poet died in 1930 and left behind some of the century's most interesting and extravagant imagery.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/sports/transactions-952093.html","abstract":"  Basketball  National Basketball Association   NBA -- Fined John Starks and the New York Knicks $5,000 each for a flagrant foul Starks committed against Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers in a playoff game Tuesday night.

Dinkins says there are many reasons why he is once again struggling to close a large, looming budget gap. But the Mayor's critics and some fiscal experts contend that the problem is simple: the city's expenses are growing faster than its revenues.   The experts have insisted for the last three years that this fundamental structural imbalance is at the core of New York City's fiscal distress, and they have warned repeatedly that budget gaps and service reductions will plague Mr. Dinkins and his successors unless the city takes bold action.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930506","headline":"In Cattle-Raising West, a County Wants to Help U.S. Manage Federal Lands","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/us/in-cattle-raising-west-a-county-wants-to-help-us-manage-federal-lands.html","abstract":"  In the last four years Catron County here in southwestern New Mexico has been a thorn in the side of environmentalists and Federal agencies. The county has been filing lawsuits against the Federal Government and passing its own land-use ordinances in a struggle to gain more authority over how Federal forest and grazing lands within its boundaries are managed.   Now the county, home to 2,600 people and a $21 million cattle industry, wants Washington to let it help manage Federal lands under a contract with the Government. And while many environmental groups are suspicious of the county's motives, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt may have no choice but to give the plan a hearing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930506","headline":"Foreign Affairs; Two Magic Peace Words . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/opinion/foreign-affairs-two-magic-peace-words.html","abstract":"  There is an old and wise rule of thumb about Arab-Israeli negotiations.

Paula Vogel, the author of \"The Baltimore Waltz,\" scrutinizes this provocative issue in \"And Baby Makes Seven,\" which opened last night at the Lucille Lortel Theater. In the play, a menage a trois awaits the imminent birth of a baby. The expectant mother (Cherry Jones) is a lesbian who wants to have a child, but without the complications of questions of paternity. The father (Peter Frechette) is gay, and the third character is the mother's lover (Mary Mara). The pregnancy begins as an act of pragmatism, but the relationships become more intricate as the three continue to live together. Their spacious New York City loft becomes a hothouse environment.   Deep within this discursive play is an untapped story of emotional alliances that transcend matters of sexual identity. Such thoughts and others are submerged in a Gothic nursery tale gone awry. Instead of exploring her characters, the playwright falls back on children's games. Together, the women have a flourishing fantasy life, in which they pretend to be children. In her fantasy, Ms. Jones becomes a proper English schoolboy, Cecil, and Ms. Mara doubles (or is it triples?) as the French youngster in the movie \"The Red Balloon\" and as a mischievous sprite named Orphan McDermott.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930507","headline":"Nostalgia and Sciatica Move to Center Court","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/sports/tennis-nostalgia-and-sciatica-move-to-center-court.html","abstract":"  So I told the cabdriver, \"Take me to the 69th Regiment Armory, in the spring of 1968,\" and suddenly I was watching people who looked like Muscles and Emmo and the Rocket play a game that looked like tennis the way it oughta be.

There are gloriously bizarre surprises hidden in the English phase of Alfred Hitchcock's career, those early days when he was scarcely a gleam in Hollywood's eye. Among the oddities from the 1930's are: a killer who turns out to be a cross-dressing trapeze artist; a wry comedy about marriage in which no one comes close to being murdered, and more toy trains than you've seen since childhood. And though Hitchcock went to Hollywood for good in 1939, he returned to England near the end of World War II to make the strangest movies of his career: two French-language propaganda films of such cynicism and double-agentry that they might end war altogether. After watching these shorts, no one could possibly figure out who was fighting whom, much less whom to trust.    \" 'Cocky' in Britain: The Early Alfred Hitchcock\" is the too-too-clever title of the delicious series that begins today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. \"Cocky\" refers to the director's boyhood nickname as well as his thumb-your-nose attitude, but while the title's peculiar British ring is jarring, it does make sense.

It is, but in giving Cubism a Bohemian slant, Czech architects and designers were actually developing an appealing provincialism. They seem to have taken from France only the surface of what Picasso and Braque had invented: a vocabulary of folded, angular forms that made the Czechs' designs for buildings and furniture look weird and agitated without being fully Cubist in their reorganization of space. At the same time, their forms bring to mind the pointy Gothic spires and the steeply gabled roofs from Prague's history.
