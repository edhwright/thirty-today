To change a law that does not need changing, Senator Alan Simpson and Representative Bill McCollum have introduced bills to turn back asylum applicants arriving at airports who lack travel documents. These bills would preclude women and children from Bosnia who have been victims of rape, torture and ethnic cleansing from seeking refuge in the United States.

Tests showed that the contamination was confined to Bay Ridge, in the area south of 86th Street and west of Fort Hamilton Parkway, said a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.

New Jersey education officials moved closer this week to seizing control of Shabazz and the rest of the Newark school system, fueling a bitter debate about how to educate poor students in the state's largest school system.

Sampras routed unseeded Guillermo Perez-Roldan, 6-0, 6-2, in just over an hour in a match interrupted twice by rain. Courier, the defending champion and playing in his first clay-court tournament of the year, never lost his serve in defeating seventh-seeded Sergi Bruguera, 6-3, 6-4. Sixth-seeded Michael Chang saved two match points and went on to defeat Andrei Chesnokov, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, in 3 hours 38 minutes, the year's longest three-set match on the tour.  Big-serving Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, seeded fourth, downed Marcelo Filippini, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, to also reach the semifinals. In today's semifinals, Sampras will play Ivanisevic, and Courier will face Chang. It's the first time in the tournament's 50-year history that three Americans have reached the semifinals.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930515","headline":"Four Admit Guilt In Fraud Schemes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/15/nyregion/four-admit-guilt-in-fraud-schemes.html","abstract":"  In a blow to the owners of an armored-car company who are accused of stealing $38 million, four people pleaded guilty today to charges stemming from the scheme.

Looming over the dark, sometimes rank canals, crumbling buildings stand silently with shuttered windows. Empty campielli -- paved squares -- echo eerily during long quiet off-season afternoons. Walking on the Lido, readers who have never opened its pages may think of Thomas Mann's \"Death in Venice.\"   Inside many churches, black shriveled relics and even whole corpses of saints lie under glass. In museums, paintings of the Crucifixion, Deposition and assorted martyrs evoke death and decay in mesmerizing detail. Even the gloriously celebratory Sala del Maggior Consiglio, the assembly hall in the Doge's Palace, is dominated by a huge \"Paradiso\" by Tintoretto, whose heaven is filled with more resurrected bodies than might be possibly fit into the cavernous hall. Death hovers almost companionably over Venice, as if it were one of the masked carnival-goers whose inscrutable pictured faces peer out of almost every shop window.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"In the Region: Westchester; Recent Sales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-recent-sales.html","abstract":"  Port Chester, N.Y.  $175,000   531 Irving Avenue  3-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath, 70-year-old Colonial; dining room, in-law apartment, detached one-car garage; taxes, $4,880.

This last volume starts in 1960 in Cambridge, Mass., where Wilson was teaching, conveniently close to his Cape Cod house in Wellfleet, Mass., and ends in upstate New York, at Talcottville, in June 1972. In it, we see his slow decline. Here are excerpts.\nCambridge, Spring 1960\n\nI HAVE sometimes lately had the impression that my appearance and personality have almost entirely disappeared, and that there is little but my books marching through me: the Indian book, the Civil War. They live, I am ceasing to live. But this is partly due to too much drinking, reading and thinking at night, then plunging into work at the library. \n[\nA friend\n]\n lays off drink twice a year for ten days or two weeks. He thus loses, he says, about seven pounds and reduces that bloated look. Inspired by this noble example, I have adopted the same course -- beginning on my 65th birthday -- and feel much the better for it. My contacts with life have become more normal, and I find that I will have to make a new hole in my belt.\nTalcottville, Summer 1961\n\n As a character in one of Chekhov's plays says he's \"a man of the 80's,\" so I find that I am a man of the 20's. I still expect something exciting: drinks, animated conversation, gaiety: an uninhibited exchange of ideas. Scott Fitzgerald's idea that somewhere things were \"glimmering.\" I am managing to discipline myself now so that I shan't be silly in this way. \nNew York, Winter 1962\n\n Had dinner with Wystan Auden before Elena \n[\nWilson's wife\n]\n arrived. He was pleased at having what he described as an honor on the part of the Establishment. He has been made an honorary fellow (I think that is the phrase) of Christ Church \n[\nCollege, Oxford\n]\n. I gather that he can retire and live there for nothing. He thinks that \"Down There on a Visit\" is Isherwood's best book -- I was just in the middle of reading it. He says the disintegrating homo on his horrible island in Greece was a real person whom he knew and the only person he knew who would drink the spirits out of lamps when there was nothing else to be had. He thought that \"Paul\" was the best of the stories. I agreed with him when I came to read it; but the whole book is rather disgusting. I am getting sick of this subject. The attitude in these books toward homosexuality involves of course a revolt against society. See the diatribe of the man on the island about putting the heterosexuals in ghettos. Paul is made by Isherwood into a hero. But Genet is the best of these writers. He is the most in revolt, the most genuinely an outlaw. \nCambridge, Spring 1962\n\n My ailments -- heart, teeth and gout -- and having endured another winter in Cambridge have lately been getting me down. I drink too much to get me out of my depression, then relapse into something like despair. The other night, after an active and serious day, I had a paroxysm of exasperation with Elena combined with an acute heart attack and smashed her filing cabinet, her typewriter and something else made of glass. She was frightened and called \n[\nthe novelist\n]\n Monroe Engel \n[\nacross the street\n]\n, who got me a doctor. He checked my pulse and my heart and gave me a shot in the arm to put me to sleep.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"The Man Who Wouldn't Be Prime Minister","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/books/the-man-who-wouldnt-be-prime-minister.html","abstract":"A LIFE AT THE CENTER\nMemoirs of a Radical Reformer.\nBy Roy Jenkins.\nIllustrated. 585 pp. New York:\nRandom House. $30.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Tactical Technology Fights Counterfeiters","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/style/stamps-tactical-technology-fights-counterfeiters.html","abstract":"  AS color-copying technology becomes more accurate, postal authorities, concerned about counterfeiting, are using more elaborate security measures in printing stamps.

In an issue where positions are often entrenched, the change of heart by Mr. Aniskovich and some other lawmakers, and their willingness to reconsider gun control in light of new arguments and rising crime, has dramatically raised hopes that the bill could pass.

They are discovering not only a pleasant coastal city with palm-shaded beaches but also a treasure-trove of intricately woven yet inexpensive lace -- bone and labyrinth laces, made primarily in small villages along Brazil's northeastern shore, and Renaissance lace from inland villages in Pernambuco State, farther south.    Portuguese colonists brought their native tradition of weaving renda, or lace, to Brazil in the early 17th century. Designs and stitches were influenced by the regular visits of Spanish and French merchants, who distributed models of new kinds of lace popular in Europe. Centuries later, Ceara women still make lace in the shady daylight of their front doorways or under gazebos roofed in straw or tile. And Brazilians still sing this folk lyric: Hey, lace maker. Hey, woman making lace. If you will teach me to make lace, I will teach you to fall in love.   The traditions, techniques and lore of lace making are passed informally from one generation of women to the next. Wives and daughters of fishermen or farmers create lace collars, doilies and tablecloths to sell to supplement their families' income.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Jennifer Whyman, David N.

Richard Norton, an official of the Air Transport Association, questioned the new passport's effectiveness in preventing the kind of tampering that would allow people to enter the United States illegally. Appearing on April 27 before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on International Law, Immigration and Refugees, Mr. Norton said the airline industry supported efforts to improve immigration inspection with technological innovations, but he called the new passport \"a flawed design.\"   Inside the new passport there is a device called a kinegram, which is similar to the holograms used on credit cards.

The space in Lake Success and Woodbury must be rented to other businesses when Olympus vacates the premises. If no rental occurs, then the developer and owner must pay the taxes. How many years can that go on, if no income comes in? The owner becomes bankrupt.   3. There will be an increase in taxes to the school district in 11 years and also to the other taxing jurisdictions. Suffolk County I.D.A. is giving Parr/ Olympus 10 percent increments for 10 years, until the total assessment comes due in the 11th year. The Town of Huntington starts with 50 percent of the tax assessment and 5 percent increments over 10 years. We, the taxpayers in Suffolk County and Huntington, lose big! Our taxes must make up the difference.   4. Opposition to the Olympus project is not just \"limited to a few households that are near or adjacent to the proposed site.\" Triangle has 1,179 paid members. We are part of Melville Civic Organizations, consisting of nine Melville civic groups. In addition Dix Hills civic associations also oppose this project. That is at least 2,000 to 2,500 people. The Huntington Town Board unanimously voted to oppose this project on the grounds that New York State is overriding local zoning. The Suffolk County Legislature voted, 10 to 6, to oppose the resolution by Presiding Officer Blydenburgh supporting overriding local zoning and in favor of the Olympus project. Opposition has also been expressed by every environmental organization concerned with preserving clean water and the Special Ground Water Preservation Areas, in which L.I.D.C. is located. Mr. Ferguson is misinforming the public or simply does not know the facts.   5. The upfront payment to New York State for the first year's rent is $7,200,000, and the Parr Development Company pays $1 a year for the remainder of the 99-year lease. The $2.1 million being spent for removal of the eight buildings currently on the site has nothing to do with the rental lease, and the cost per acre of the 56.9 acres is $134,000 an acre, which is \"residential,\" not commercially priced, land. By rights, the Olympus Corporation should be paying for land on the commercially zoned Route 110 corridor, which is anywhere from $350,000 to $750,000 an acre. Once again, the taxpayers of New York State, Suffolk County and Huntington are losing money. Olympus is paying nothing for publicly owned land to be used for their private benefit.   If the Olympus Project is so perfect, would anyone explain why there is a continual drumbeat of publicity in the media by its supporters to justify their position? Could anyone tell us why so much of what they say is inaccurate?

The noble Don Pedro and his soldiers gallop toward the house of their host, Leonato. As the opening credits appear, Mr. Branagh cuts furiously between the fast-approaching soldiers (long shots of horsemen coming over the hill, close-ups of each man riding in dust and wind) and the household's preparations (women in a flurry of bathing bodies and flying clothes). Finally the two groups march toward each other in Leonato's courtyard, with the camera rising in the air to gaze down on the beautifully resolved scene. The episode captures visually all the spirit and excitement behind that single line, and sets the joyful tone of the film.    This \"Much Ado\" is a glorious version of Shakespeare, and it works not because it is Shakespearean but because it is cinematic. Mr. Branagh, who adapted the play for the screen and directed it, is faithful to Shakespeare's language and true to the raucous spirit of romance in the courtship of the determinedly unmarried Benedick (Mr. Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson).

The dining areas spark memories of Prezzo in New Canaan, and it turns out that both Italian restaurants (as well as Portofino in Wilton) share the same ownership. Like Prezzo's, the menu fits right in with current Italian restaurant style. It combines several pasta dishes, classic entrees like saltimbocca romana, current trendy starters like funghi alla griglia (hugely delicious grilled portobello mushrooms in an herb aioli), and both traditional and specialty pizzas from a wood-fired oven.

Wilhelm Steinitz seems to have been the first to retreat a knight boldly and without embarrassment for the sake of a powerful repositioning. It's not on record whether anyone laughed -- certainly his opponent, who had no antidote, did not. Steinitzian retreats still catch opponents unawares, as can be seen in the game between the grandmasters Grigory Kaidanov of Lexington, Ky., and Aleksandr Goldin of Russia from Round 4 of the Hudson International Tournament at Pace University in Pleasantville, N.Y.

The contented -- the top 20 percent in income in our society -- are a minority in number but a majority in power, asserts John Kenneth Galbraith. Opposed to economic reform, these are the voters who brought us the lower taxes and laissez-faire approaches of the Administrations of the last two Republican Presidents. Last year our reviewer, Robert N. Bellah, said: \"I know of no book -- and I have read a number of excellent discussions of the subject lately -- that treats more incisively or more convincingly the profoundly injurious consequences of these policies to our economy.\" Houghton Mifflin has also reissued Mr. Galbraith's strangely prescient 1968 novel THE TRIUMPH ($9.95), in which the American Government intervenes in Latin America on behalf of a corrupt but anti-Communist dictator.

Playing a homosexual window dresser who holds the brutalities of prison life at bay by the sheer force of his imagination, Mr. Carver gives a performance of such uncompromising truth that he qualifies, instantly and henceforth, as a star.

Polly Jean Harvey's rock trio emerged from the small English town of Yeovil, recorded a magnificent debut album, \"Dry,\" for less than $5,000 and performed around England to wildly adoring audiences and rave reviews. Riding the momentum of its British buzz, the group signed to Island Records in this country and toured America. Even those wary of hype were virtually unanimous in praising Harvey's combination of serene control and primal jolt.    Her songs, about female archetypes, anger, pleasures and doubts, were taken to heart by listeners; her singing drew comparisons to every female vocalist in rock history. P. J. Harvey was on critics' best of 1992 lists across the country. But in 10 months of availability in the United States, the album sold only about 85,000 copies. The band's strong new album, \"Rid of Me,\" pushes the extremes a little farther, adding the muscularity that comes with a (slightly) bigger budget; it may already have outsold \"Dry.\" Yet I'm not expecting it to knock Whitney Houston out of the Top 10, either.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Renee Doummar, John N.

Though married and more than 40 years younger than Stieglitz when she first encountered him in his Manhattan art gallery in 1927, she was drawn swiftly into his world, enthralled by his genius and powerful convictions as well as by the contemporary art he championed. Their relationship grew intimate and mutually sustaining, and lasted until his death in 1946. As pointed out in the essays by the photography critic and curator Miles Barth and the photography historian Edward Abrahams in INTIMATE VISIONS: The Photographs of Dorothy Norman (Chronicle Books, cloth, $27.50; paper, $17.95), Ms. Norman did not pursue a career as a photographer but approached photography as a private act of love and wonder. Her cityscapes, portraits, images of flowers and architecture are reproduced here in the rich tones favored by her mentor and in their original small scale. Not too surprisingly, Stieglitz is a vital presence in this elegantly designed book. He inspired her style and subjects; even his handwriting becomes part of the book's graphic design. The many portraits reveal the range of movers and shakers with whom Ms. Norman, who is now 88 years old, was acquainted -- Lewis Mumford, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Richard Wright and Elia Kazan, among others. Her pictures of Stieglitz, however, are more animated and more, in his words, wonderfully seen.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Average Traffic Speed: 2.7 Miles Per Hour","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/average-traffic-speed-2.7-miles-per-hour.html","abstract":"  After a day slogging through the Garment District in a rickety truck loaded with dress suits, Jerome Miller was nearing the end of his delivery route.

At a news conference, the conductor Herbert von Karajan said, \"All else is gaslight.\" He convinced Sony, which developed the format with Philips, to build the first European CD plant in his own Austrian village, near Salzburg. The classical repertory influenced the playing time of the CD, which was designed to contain Beethoven's 70-minute Ninth Symphony. And though the aura of art camouflaged the artifice of CD sound (Luddites like myself still prefer the LP), the link with classical music helped market the new medium: High-priced CD's and players found their first buyers in the high-income classical audience.   Two new digital formats, which have received some attention in recent months, take the opposite approach. They are being presented with an emphasis on pop; only a few classical labels have shown interest. Sony has developed the mini-disk (MD) system, which uses a 2.5-inch disk for both recording and playback in a Walkman-like unit; Philips, which invented the conventional cassette, is offering a successor, the digital compact cassette (DCC).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"The Candidates on the Issues","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/race-for-governor-the-candidates-on-the-issues.html","abstract":"  On June 8, Republicans in New Jersey will select a challenger to Gov.

Strengths: Experience, strong grasp of the issues. Weaknesses: Late start, vague message, low name recognition. ABORTION Each candidate supports a woman's right to choose.  Wallwork: Opposes governmental financing.  Whitman: No additional comment.  Edwards: No additional comment. TAXES All dislike the $2.8 billion tax increase that Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature. They are divided over how to dismantle it. Wallwork: Favors repealing the entire package. Proposes to do so by cutting four percent ($550 million) from the state's annual budget in his first four years in office. Whitman: Has backed off early statements that indicated she would repeal all the taxes immediately. Now says cutting the taxes will be a \"goal\" of her administration, but has not been specific about how she would do this. Edwards: Wants the Republican-controlled Legislature to immediately reduce the income tax and to make other tax changes beginning with the 1994 budget proposals now under discussion. Says he would push for an elected state auditor to help him identify waste and overstaffing in state government and would use those cuts to offset repeal of the taxes. EDUCATION Reform and financing of the state's public school system will be one of the major problems facing the Governor. Wallwork: Believes New Jersey already spends enough money on public schools but that much of it is wasted. Says he would want the public to decide through ballot referenda on programs that would allow public money to be spent to send children to private schools. Mr. Wallwork's daughter attended both public and private schools when she was growing up.  Whitman: Supports a pilot program of vouchers that would allow parents to use public funds to send their children to private or parochial schools if they desired. Mrs. Whitman's two children, a 15-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, have always attended private schools. Edwards: Proposes replacing centralized state control of education with community-designed schools for each of the state's 611 school districts to replace the centralized control by the state. Favors what he calls charter schools, which would allow each school district to tailor its curriculum. Opposes spending public funds on vouchers and other programs to send children to private or parochial schools. Mr. Edwards' youngest daughter, a 16-year-old, attends public school, as did his other daughter, who is now an adult. Each of the daughters attended at least one year of private school. CRIME The candidates all support the death penalty. Each favors boot camps for juvenile offenders. Wallwork: Would convert Fort Dix and Fort McGuire into penal institutions for juveniles and first-time offenders run by former military personnel. Says the prime way to combat crime is to create jobs. Whitman: Advocates amending state laws to permit a jury to learn about the effect of a murder on the victim's family and to consider the defendant's criminal record; increasing criminal penalties for child abuse; establishing an automobile theft prevention authority. Edwards: Proposes establishing \"Gun-Free School Zones,\" putting 4,000 more police officers on the streets, setting mandatory sentences for crimes against senior citizens and creating a firearms strike force to get illegal guns off the street.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"A Reader's Guide to the Balkans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/books/l-a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans-397993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Robert D.

It would not be a great loss to design. The whole field is such a shambles today -- despite annual gatherings in Aspen, Colo., Los Angeles and New York -- that one more conference is not going to put things right. In fact, if people don't show up next month at the International Design Conference at Aspen, the most venerable of the convocations, design might come out ahead. There would be reason to hope that American designers could regain the sense of social mission the Aspen conference once stood for.   In February, the board of the International Design Conference at Aspen voted to go ahead with this year's meeting in spite of Colorado's passage of Amendment 2, the state measure that excludes homosexuals from civil-rights protection. In a written statement, the board expressed its opposition to Amendment 2 but declined to honor the boycott that has been organized to protest it. (In response to that boycott, 24 groups have canceled conventions planned for Colorado.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"L.I.

Though the streets no longer throng six months a year with Carnival's masked revelers, though the famous gambling casinos and courtesans are gone, the daily spectacle of watching ordinary life unfold here remains one of the city's great joys. Part of this is simply to do with Venice's beauty generally as a setting: flat water, a pale moon, the silhouettes of domes, balconies and battlements. But much of the delight of watching the city go about its business -- as if this were all a performance arranged specially for our amusement -- must be credited to how well Venice's public squares actually function as places to meet, speak, stroll, eat and work.\n\nWith time, almost everyone chooses a favorite. My own, the campo Santa Maria Nova, is small and conspicuously unremarkable. Yet, it is a lively world with the feel of someplace perfectly complete: a rectangle, centered on a row of six wooden park benches, flanked by two leafless city trees, with, at one end, a wall and a telephone, and, at the other, a small bridge, a minor canal, and the inlaid marble walls and lead gray domes of the apse of Santa Maria dei Miracoli -- a diminutive Renaissance church so lovely, even the opinionated scholar John Ruskin had to acknowledge it as one of the city's wonders. The other buildings around the campo are without any particular architectural interest, although two do have traditional Venetian chimneys -- the squat cylinders of brick, topped by a thick tapering funnel, which always figure so prominently in the skylines of late 15th-century paintings. All are modest houses, of four or five low stories, inhabited, it would seem, in their upper floors, mostly by pensioners of limited means. At street level are a simple trattoria, a grocery, a cookie bakery with a coffee bar, and an altogether admirable assortment of shops, including a hairdresser, a frame-maker, a jeweler, a lampshade maker, a shop dealing in nightgowns and functional-looking lingerie, and what must be surely the most dilapidated and uninviting of Venice's many shoe repair stores.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930516","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/nyregion/c-corrections-307793.html","abstract":"  A picture essay on beauty beginning on page 42 of The Times Magazine today includes an erroneous credit.

Holding up progress is an internal battle whose outlines were made clear last week by Ira Magaziner, a senior task force official, in remarks to a group of manufacturers. On one side are those, like Mr. Magaziner, who believe competition is the best tool for reining in health care costs while encouraging innovation. On the other side are those who believe medical costs will spiral higher until Washington slaps price controls and regulations on insurers, doctors and hospitals. The difference is so profound that it remains unclear whether the task force will emerge with a useful hybrid or a mishmash of conflicting ideas.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930517","headline":"Canada Investigates Reported Ties of Rightist Militants and Military","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/17/world/canada-investigates-reported-ties-of-rightist-militants-and-military.html","abstract":"  What started as an allegation in March that a Somali man was killed by racist soldiers of a Canadian peacekeeping force has turned into a full-scale Defense Department inquiry into links between the military and white supremacists and other right-wing militants.

But that is exactly what has happened. While Mayor David N. Dinkins and City Council leaders are preparing for a tough budget that will probably contain millions of dollars in spending cuts in some areas, the overall cost of the city government has actually grown by $1.1 billion in the last 12 months and will grow at least by another $800 million in the next fiscal year, budget officials said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930517","headline":"Past Holds Future at New Lyons Opera House","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/17/arts/past-holds-future-at-new-lyons-opera-house.html","abstract":"  The posters are all over France: \"Un Nouvel Opera -- Lyon.\" This is a play on words. The phrase means \"new opera,\" but it is also a recognition of Jean Nouvel, one of France's best-known if most controversial architects, who designed the striking new opera house that opened here this weekend with a mini-festival of premieres.   But \"a new opera\" is not quite accurate. This weekend has been an important event in the cultural history of France, not just of Lyons, on several counts: architectural, musical, operatic, choreographic and political. But overriding all was the French esthetic desire and national need to unite new with old, to create novelty from the very act of remaining true to tradition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930517","headline":"Surprised by the Limelight, A Colonel's Gay Son Shines","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/17/us/surprised-by-the-limelight-a-colonel-s-gay-son-shines.html","abstract":"  Two days after he was \"outed\" before the nation by his own father, Scott Peck finished a strong defense of his homosexuality on the Larry King television program and was rewarded with a kiss from his lover, Bobby Hampson, as the two moved on to the next station and the next interview that would delve into a riveting story of father and son.

Dancers seem to be turning to drama these days. But Ms. Marshall's work has tended to be dramatic vignettes from the start. What is a revelation is Ms. Marshall's gifts as a writer and a director. \"Walter's Finest Hours\" is a first purely theatrical effort but it has the confidence and sensitivity of long
