Of course, nothing is as it seems: the young man may himself be deluded, his seductive young wife may have her own lethal agenda and the father may not be nearly as dangerous as he seems.

CURRICULUM VITAE: Autobiography By Muriel Spark. Houghton Mifflin, $10.95. Who was the model for Miss Jean Brodie? Who inspired the sad finality of \"Memento Mori\"? This memoir of the author's first 39 years reveals what was autobiography and what was invention in many of her novels, as well as the facts behind her early failed marriage and her conversion to Roman Catholicism. Last year our reviewer, Helen Bevington, said, \"Reticent when she chooses but always free of invention, Muriel Spark succeeds in her mission: she puts the record straight.\" \"Curriculum Vitae\" ends with the publication of Ms. Spark's first novel, THE COMFORTERS (New Directions, $10.95), which has just been reissued. In it a writer and Catholic convert begins hearing voices that make her realize she is a fictional character herself. The book \"adds to the growing evidence that Kingsley Amis and other members of the 'couldn't-care-less' school of writers are not the only lively force in British fiction today,\" Aileen Pippett said in The New York Times in 1957. New Directions has also restored to print THE DRIVER'S SEAT (New Directions Bibelot, $6), Ms. Spark's novel about a breezy young European woman who sets off on a vacation to find a boyfriend and determinedly orchestrates her own demise.

Beethoven's white-hot intensity is in evidence in the Brazilian composer's best works for orchestra; and while it is an exaggeration to ascribe to his compositions the formal perfection of Bach, there is no doubt that he was a master of counterpoint, a brilliant writer with a remarkably fluent and versatile musical mind.   Yet Vidal's metaphor, generous as it is, does not go far enough, for Villa-Lobos was also a master of a musical medium that never particularly interested Bach or Beethoven: the song. He is best known for his \"Bachiana Brasileira\" No. 5, scored for soprano and eight cellos, which has been recorded by everyone from Victoria de los Angeles, who sang it on the composer's own recording, to Galina Vishnevskaya and Kiri Te Kanawa. But he also wrote a great body of folk songs, many of them with texts in obscure Amazon Indian languages and the Afro-Brazilian patois.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941002","headline":"Challenging Kuhn","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/sports/l-challenging-kuhn-418447.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   What planet has Bowie Kuhn been living on for the last few years (\"Let's Put Reason Back in Baseball Debate,\" Sept. 25, The Times)?

To arrive at a definitive set of performing parts is a highly contentious matter, and thus grist for the fine-grinding mills of musicologists, who love nothing more than a good scrape.   Although Haydn's 106 symphonies are one of the best-known and most widely performed bodies of work in Western music, they have not always been well served by the record labels. Just four years ago, the CD catalogue lacked a complete set of them. But now three complete Haydn symphony projects are under way, and although the two most interesting ones, led by Christopher Hogwood on L'Oiseau-Lyre and Roy Goodman on Hyperion, both use period instruments, they sound very different. Behind the difference lies a sharp scholarly dispute, as recent conversations with some of the combatants revealed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941002","headline":"Reveille for New Rochelle's Abandoned Army Fort?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/realestate/reveille-for-new-rochelle-s-abandoned-army-fort.html","abstract":"  FOR 27 years, Davids Island, lying unoccupied in Long Island Sound just off this Westchester County city, has enticed developers.

Bernstein was about to remedy that situation. Mahler, he explained, was a great composer and an important conductor; he had led the Philharmonic on that very stage. Though \"one of the most unhappy people in history,\" he often wrote ecstatic music. He was a \"double man,\" caught between opposing worlds. And in everything he wrote, his feelings were \"extreme, exaggerated, like young people's feelings.\" Mahler, Bernstein made clear, was much like himself, even like the listeners who sat before him.   This was a remarkable example of what Bernstein could accomplish in the 53 Young People's Concerts he presented between 1958 and 1972. Scripts for 15 of them have been collected in an Anchor paperback, and videotapes of 25 are available from Sony Classical and the Leonard Bernstein Society; all are models of music teaching. Bernstein talked pungently about modes and keys, pitch intervals and sonata form, folk music in the concert hall and the nature of musical Impressionism. He did not shy away from fundamental questions about meaning in music or the nature of musical humor. There is no one today who can address a young audience with comparable depth and simplicity, and such a person has never been needed more than now.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941002","headline":"Heather Albert And Michael Dyer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/style/weddings-heather-albert-and-michael-dyer.html","abstract":"  Heather Leigh Albert, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Burton Albert of Weston, Conn., was married there yesterday to Michael David Dyer, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Richard E.

I cannot comprehend how people hear unambiguous uplift in this work; to my ears, it is a far darker piece than the Shostakovich Fifth, whose ambivalence is so often touted.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941003","headline":"A Fusion of Punk and Reggae That Has Lasted","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/03/arts/pop-review-a-fusion-of-punk-and-reggae-that-has-lasted.html","abstract":"  In England at the end of the 1970's, punk-rockers and reggae bands found common cause in battling racially motivated violence. The musical result was the so-called \"two-tone\" movement. It spawned integrated bands that revived the fast oompah beat of a 1960's Jamaican style called ska, added the raw fervor of punk and laced the resulting party music with messages. Checkerboard graphics, close-cropped hair and natty black-and-white outfits, including skinny ties and porkpie hats, completed the package. The music came and went like other pop fads in Britain, but it found a lasting audience in the United States. On Friday night, Irving Plaza was packed with checkerboard-accessorized, hyperactive dancers for a concert by the Specials, one of the first two-tone bands. A younger, more purist ska band, Let's Go Bowling, opened the concert.    Fifteen years after they released their first single, \"Gangsters,\" the Specials sound more robust than they did in their heyday. Four members of the current seven-piece Specials were in the original band: Neville Staples (vocals), Roddy (Radiation) Byers (guitar), Lynval Golding (guitar) and Horace Panter (bass). Instead of Terry Hall's yelping lead vocals, the band now has Mr. Byers and Mr. Staples harmonizing with the other band members. The band's music is a ska fusion, with elements of reggae, surf-rock, punk-rock and English football cheers. And years of propelling dancers have toughened up the already limber rhythm section.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941003","headline":"Core of Tax Cut Debate: New York's Self-Image","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/03/nyregion/metro-matters-core-of-tax-cut-debate-new-york-s-self-image.html","abstract":"  WITH just over a month to go before New York elects its next governor, it would help to get one thing clear: the tax cut debate between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his Republican opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki, is not, at its core, about cutting taxes. It is about New York's definition of itself. Because unless New York is prepared to change dramatically what it is and long has been, it will never have low taxes. Lower? Yes. But low? Not likely.   Put simply, New York has vast obligations and historically high standards. The state is home to a lot of needy people and helps care for them because Federal dollars do not go far enough. But New York does not stop there. It spends more than most other states, and not just on the poor. New Yorkers have always had expensive tastes. Even Republican New Yorkers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941003","headline":"'Quiz Show' Plays With Facts of TV Scandal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/03/opinion/l-quiz-show-plays-with-facts-of-tv-scandal-409006.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Robert Redford's \"Quiz Show\" is a good piece of moviemaking depicting a 1950's television quiz show scandal.

When the Jesus Lizard, a quartet based in Chicago, performed on Saturday night at Irving Plaza, its singer, David Yow, dived into the audience repeatedly and sang entire songs while propped up on the arms and heads of his fans. Remarkably, Mr. Yow rarely missed more than a line or two of each song, even when he was accidentally dropped on the floor.   Mr. Yow didn't care much about sound quality when onstage either. He often cupped his hands around the microphone to muffle his voice and dropped the microphone on the ground with a thud. The music was much less freewheeling than Mr. Yow's antics. The Jesus Lizard plays hard, heavy rock in which the guitar, bass and drums are strictly syncopated, providing structure behind Mr. Yow's distorted lyrics about death and mayhem. The bassist, David Wm. Sims, is the lead instrumentalist, plucking his bass incessantly and melodically over the loud, precise drumming of Mac McNeilly and the low-pitched chiming of Duane Denison's guitar.

He also made his Metropolitan Opera debut conducting Verdi's \"Otello,\" and in his empathetic shaping of the score proved to be an ideal accompaniment for the contemporary master of the title role, Placido Domingo.   Last weekend at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Gergiyev brought the Kirov Opera's orchestra here from St. Petersburg as part of a 12-city United States tour, and again showed why he inspires the sort of wonder that used to be reserved for touring Russians during the Iron Curtain days. Mr. Gergiyev (born in 1953) has established the Kirov Opera as the most significant musical organization in Russia (at least for Westerners).

By opening up Japanese markets for insurance, telecommunications and medical equipment, the accord will bring lower prices to Japan and higher sales to the U.S. The U.S. backed down from benighted demands that numerical targets be set for imports into Japan -- and seems willing to turn down the rhetoric that has needlessly inflamed trade disputes.   The economic impact of the accord will be small -- boosting Japanese imports by less than $2 billion, by one estimate, only some of which will come from U.S. companies. Nor is the agreement novel; in hammering hard at blatantly protectionist rules and regulations in Japan, it mirrors accords that previous Administrations struck on computers and farm goods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941004","headline":"1894: Storm in Venice : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/opinion/IHT-1894-storm-in-venice-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"VENICE - For three days a tempest has raged in Venice.

The 92d Street Y, the ensemble's founding patron, has made clear its intention to get out of the orchestra management business and to cut back on its arts presentations generally. The orchestra's response was to form its own board and to start raising money for its budget. There has even been talk of moving to Carnegie Hall or Alice Tully Hall, but cooler heads on the board have argued against severing the umbilical cord precipitately. The orchestra has a long association with the Y and its concert hall, and it has a loyal subscriber base there.   For Mr. Schwarz and his musicians, this new independence means having to prove anew that there is a need for them in New York, a city rich in orchestras of all sizes and specialties. From a utopian perspective, this should not be a problem: the orchestra has always played well, and Mr. Schwarz has often used its youthful vigor and the transparency afforded by its chamber proportions to present illuminating views of familiar scores.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941004","headline":"Irvan Is Hoping to Race Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/sports/auto-racing-notebook-irvan-is-hoping-to-race-again.html","abstract":"  Ernie Irvan continues his rehabilitation from injuries suffered in a practice crash at Michigan International Speedway on Aug. 20. \"He's making steady progress, gauged by such things as a gradual increase in the amount of weight he can lift with each kind of exercise equipment,\" said Brian VanDercook, a spokesman for Robert Yates Racing, Irvan's Winston Cup team.   \"Judging by what his physical therapist told me yesterday,\" VanDercook said by telephone from Charlotte Wednesday night, \"he's made some significant progress from last Friday.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941004","headline":"Drillers Find Lost World of Ancient Microbes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/science/drillers-find-lost-world-of-ancient-microbes.html","abstract":"  FICTION writers have fantasized about it.

The astronomers made a more precise measurement of the distance to the Virgo cluster of galaxies, 50 million light-years away, as the basis for computing the rate at which the universe is expanding.
