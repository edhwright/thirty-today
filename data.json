Manhattan, which got 16 points apiece from Heshimu Evans and Ted Ellis against the Peacocks, is preparing for Saturday afternoon's clash with Siena (3-10) at Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, where last season, the Jaspers crushed the Saints in a regular-season game before more than 13,000 spectators.   \"Going into the first game of the season, we had no idea how good we were,\" said Fraschilla, whose team has reeled off four straight victories after a disappointing loss to Iona. \"After the Iona game, we took a good look at ourselves in the mirror. We weren't doing the things that people took notice of earlier in the season. We needed to get back to playing great team defense, playing with great intensity and enthusiasm and using our depth to win.\"   Despite getting his team back on a winning track, Fraschilla thinks there is still much room for improvement. \"We're only 70 percent of where we can be six weeks from now, so we just want to keep getting better,\" he said. \"I don't even think our kids realize that it's our best start in 40 years. We just have them focused on asking 'Who's next?' \"  Canisius  The Golden Griffins (9-6), who have defeated Cincinnati, Penn and North Carolina-Charlotte this season, pose the biggest threat to Manhattan in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Three big reasons for Canisius's strong play has been its frontline of Micheal Meeks, a 6-foot-8-inch junior center from Brampton, Ontario; Darrell Barley, a 6-5 junior forward from Rochester, and Craig Wise, a 6-4 forward from Philadelphia.   Meeks, who is leading the M.A.A.C. in scoring with an 18.4 average, is also hauling down 6.6 rebounds per game. Barley is the league's fourth-leading scorer at 16.5 points a game, and Wise is seventh over all, producing 14.9 points a game.   \"Great teams can have a bad day and still win. That won't happen at Canisius because we do not have that type of talent,\" said John Beilein, the Canisius coach. \"But if we do play well, we've shown we can play with anybody.\"   Canisius is preparing this week for Saturday's home game against St. Bonaventure (8-7).  St. Bonaventure   The Bonnies of the Atlantic 10 had lost 45 consecutive league road games until last week's 78-56 blowout of Duquesne. Oddly enough, St. Bonaventure's road hex, which began in February 1989, was ended on Friday the 13th.    \"I didn't know that,\" St. Bonaventure Coach Jim Baron said yesterday. \"We're getting better. It was a great effort on our part and I think our enthusiasm carried over from the Massachusetts game, which we lost in overtime. We set a goal for ourselves at the beginning of the year that we would win some road games in the league, and we got one.\"  Army   The Cadets (9-5), who are coming off an 89-82 upset of Patriot League-leading Holy Cross on Tuesday night, are off to their best start since the 1978-79 season. That season, the Cadets jumped out to an 11-3 start under a coach named Mike Krzyzewski.    \"We're real pleased with the victory over Holy Cross,\" said Army's current head coach, Dino Gaudio. \"We beat a very good team, and we were just fortunate at the end to pull it out.\"   Army, which next plays at Navy on Saturday afternoon, is led by Mark Leuking, the nation's third-leading scorer. Leuking, a 5-10 junior guard from Austin, Ind., who is averaging 26.8 points a game, had a team-high 24 points against Holy Cross.    \"We knew this was an important game as far as the season was concerned,\" said Leuking. \"Coach kept reminding us, kept drilling us how much we needed this game, but we were already prepared to play it.\"  Syracuse  Syracuse (13-1) has won 13 straight games, including Tuesday night's 91-87 victory over St. John's, a contest in which the Orangemen squandered almost all of a 19-point lead. Despite their winning streak and rise in the national polls, the Orangemen, who have lost big leads on several occasions this season, are not happy with their overall performance.   \"It's been shown the past couple of games that we don't have the killer instinct,\" said Lawrence Moten, who scored 21 points against the Red Storm. \"We have to want to stick the dagger in their hearts. We kind of let people back in the ball game. We can't be doing that.\"   The Orangemen, who have wasted big leads against Villanova and Pittsburgh, will be shooting for more consistency Saturday afternoon at Providence (10-3). Penn  After being routed by Massachusetts last week, the Quakers (9-2) returned the favor against La Salle on Tuesday night, hammering the Explorers, 90-71. Although Penn had six players in double-figure scoring, one of them was not the team's leading scorer, Jerome Allen, who finished with just 2 points on free throws and 6 turnovers.   \"Jerome Allen doesn't have to score for us to be effective,\" said Coach Fran Dunphy, whose team plays at St. Joseph's (8-4) on Saturday evening. \"He does so many other things well.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Johnson, 2 Other Jet Starters in Draft Pool","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/sports/pro-football-johnson-2-other-jet-starters-in-draft-pool.html","abstract":"  The Jets have exposed three starters -- including the high-priced running back Johnny Johnson -- to help fill the rosters of the Carolina Cougars and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Critics, both Democrat and Republican, say the plan will leave American taxpayers dangerously exposed if Mexico defaults on its bonds. They want Mexican concessions for American loan guarantees, including sale of the state-owned petroleum monopoly. They would also force adoption of labor reforms that Mexico steadfastly rejected during negotiations over Nafta, the free-trade accord with the U.S. and Canada.   The opponents are wrong. The Clinton plan is ingeniously designed to stabilize the Mexican economy without costing U.S. taxpayers any money. By stabilizing the peso, it would protect U.S. exports and prevent a temporary influx of imports and illegal immigrants. The plan would also stop financial turmoil from spreading elsewhere in Latin America.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Why Replanting Christmas Trees Is Noble Folly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/opinion/l-why-replanting-christmas-trees-is-noble-folly-483395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Like Samuel Leff (letter, Jan. 11) I also am a hiker and a nature lover, but as a horticulturist I must disagree with him about the annual \"massacre\" of Christmas trees.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950119","headline":"Critic of the Left Ready to Step Aside","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/arts/critic-of-the-left-ready-to-step-aside.html","abstract":"  Norman Podhoretz, an outspoken champion of the political left who went on to become one of its leading scourges, will step down in May from his 35-year term as editor in chief of Commentary magazine.

Fujimori might have been expected to cringe at the sight of his wife starting a sidewalk hunger strike against the Government. But he took the news in stride on Wednesday. He ordered his health minister to send an ambulance. Then, he sat down for lunch.   That evening, television news programs first showed the President, eating seafood washed down with white wine, seated at a cloth-covered banquet table. Then, viewers saw his wife, Susana Higuchi, being rushed to a hospital after fainting in the summer heat from dehydration and hunger.   \"It's quite dramatic,\" mused Augusto Alvarez Rodrich, a pollster here. \"Six months ago, she was in the Presidential Palace, now she's fainting on a sidewalk. But at the end of the day, I don't think it will cost Fujimori many votes.\"   Mr. Fujimori seems to be weathering an unrelenting six-month assault by his worst political enemy, his wife of 20 years.   Opinion polls routinely show Mr. Fujimori favored by about 45 percent of voters, more than the sum of the 12 other candidates, including his closest rival, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations Secretary General. Today, Peru's major electoral mystery revolves around whether Mr. Fujimori will be re-elected in the first round of voting on April 9 or in a June run-off.   But in a new twist for Peru's traditionally messy electoral politics, the President's wife is doing her best to make sure that his first term is his last.   Using Peru's radio, television, newspapers and magazines to wash the Presidential palace's dirty laundry in public, Ms. Higuchi over the last six months has accused her husband of having a mistress, lying to the public, being heartless to the poor, tolerating official corruption, being a dictator, locking her out of the palace, preventing her from seeing their four teen-age children, sabotaging her political aspirations, and plotting to kidnap her.   \"It appears that the intention was to put me in a cellar -- then goodbye Susana,\" the diminutive, 44-year-old civil engineer and businesswoman told reporters.   Just before Christmas, she filed for divorce, and then told reporters that her husband, a self-described Catholic, was really an agnostic.   Through it all, the 56-year-old Mr. Fujimori, an iron-willed figure who in four years has broken the backs of hyperinflation and of the Shining Path guerrilla movement, has smiled, albeit thinly, knowing that his public approval rating has not budged much since July, hovering around 65 percent.   \"Fujimori's relationship with the people is similar to Ronald Reagan's,\" said Mr. Alvarez Rodrich, who directs Apoyo, the nation's leading polling group. \"He comes under heavy criticism. But in the end people support him. Perez de Cuellar has yet to explain, in simple language: Why bother to change a President who in the eyes of the public is successful?\"   In addition to smashing the Shining Path, Mr. Fujimori has slashed inflation, from 7,000 percent in 1990 to 15 percent last year, sparking an economic boom that has given Peru the fastest-growing economy in North or South America for the last two years.   Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a patrician career diplomat who turned 75 today, seems to lack the common touch on the campaign trail and draws only small crowds. His coalition, Union for Peru, is a lightning rod for a diverse group of opponents to Mr. Fujimori: Socialists, retired army officers, Indians, Protestants and union leaders.   After three months of the campaign, no candidate has seriously dented Mr. Fujimori's support, despite opposition charges that the Peruvian Government is bankrolling Mr. Fujimori's reelection campaign.    Two weeks ago, Peru's Congress, controlled by Fujimori supporters, passed a watered-down election law that bars the President from making campaign speeches while he inaugurates public works projects.   With public works a key source of political patronage, Lima's Mayor, Ricardo Belmont, decided last year to run for president on a ticket called Obras, or Public Works. Sensing a threat, Mr. Fujimori promptly cut $22 million in federal funds from Lima's city budget, forcing the Mayor to cancel 14 major public works projects. Once a popular figure, Mr. Belmont now runs fourth in the polls, winning 3 percent of voter preferences.   Bristling at the complaints, the National Electoral Board vows that the general elections in April will be fair. Responding to an opposition complaint, the board last month invalidated about 14,000 voter identity cards that were illegally issued to army and police officers.   At every turn, Mr. Fujimori and his supporters have sought to stifle Ms. Higuchi's own political aspirations. Last July, Peru's Congress approved what is widely called \"the Susana law,\" barring the spouse or blood relative of a Peruvian President from running for Congress or for the Presidency.   Ignoring the law, Ms. Higuchi formed a political movement, called, ironically, Harmony. In October, she filed a petition to run for President, and, in January, a petition to run for Congress. In both cases, the board rejected the petitions on technical grounds. Protesting the latest rejection, Ms. Higuchi embarked on the hunger strike.   Today, with doctors urging her to abandon the protest, Ms. Higuchi might seem to be running low of ammunition in her war against her husband. But few people expect harmony to settle over the Presidential Palace. A few weeks before the election, book stores are to start selling Ms. Higuchi's tell-all memoirs.

With entrees at dinner costing up to $24, you can see how difficult it would be to include an appetizer and a dessert and still pay no more than $25. Nonetheless, Marichu is an oddity, a restaurant specializing in the foods of the Basque country, and it's in an unusual location, near the United Nations. For these reasons, Marichu is worth the limbo dance necessary to wiggle under the dollar limit.   Marichu, which opened four months ago on the ground floor of a brownstone on East 46th Street, is a mom-and-pop operation. Mom is Teresa Barrenechea, a Basque who by day is a press officer in the Spanish Mission to the United Nations and by night oversees the kitchen. Pop is Raynold von Samson, Ms. Barrenechea's husband, a former banker who was born in Germany but grew up in the Basque region. He manages the front of the house. The couple also own Marichu in Bronxville, N.Y., which opened in September 1991.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950120","headline":"Alaska Dog Mushing Harms Animal Athletes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/opinion/l-alaska-dog-mushing-harms-animal-athletes-672695.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   It is understandable that Marylou Whitney would like to recapture the happy moments of her Alaska honeymoon in 1958 (Chronicle, Jan. 16).

The I.N.S. ordered his deportation; but the agency had no place to detain Mr. Medina, so it released him on a $10,000 bond. When he failed to surrender for deportation, the I.N.S. did not pursue him. Two modern-day bounty hunters working for the bondsman brought him in.    This surprising story recounted in The Times last week demonstrates the enormous task facing the I.N.S. The agency is charged with finding illegal immigrants, who have become a favorite target of angry voters. There may be four million illegal immigrants altogether. Of that number, the agency has managed to target only 472,000 for deportation.

Mr. Thielemann's technique is energetic, showy and at times a little quirky. Often he looms over the violins, listening intently and alternating coaxing gestures with quick, furious hand movements, as if he were trying to erase a wrong note on a sheet of score paper. Given the slightest musical provocation, he dances from the left side of the podium to the right and back again, throwing cues along the way and swooping down on one unsuspecting section or another.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950121","headline":"In Performance; JAZZ","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/arts/in-performance-jazz-580695.html","abstract":"  A Percussionist's Palette, From Plink to Rumble  Gerry Hemingway Merkin Concert Hall","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950121","headline":"Arkansas Officials Given Probation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/sports/sports-people-colleges-arkansas-officials-given-probation.html","abstract":"  The athletic training director, DEAN WEBER, and the head trainer, DAVID ENGLAND, at the University of Arkansas were sentenced to fines, community service and two years' probation yesterday for keeping poor records of federally controlled pain-killing drugs.

Having spoken with literally thousands of parents, children and teachers, we were appalled at the public's wealth of environmental misunderstanding.\n\nWe were equally chagrined by the superficiality of what we heard, and have coined a new term for this type of sound-bite-based, factoid-heavy understanding: eco-glibberish. Here are half a dozen examples:\nRecycling Is the Key\n\n Myth: The most important thing we can do is to recycle. Actually, it's one of the least important things we can do, if our real objective is to conserve resources. Remember the phrase \"reduce, reuse and recycle\"? Reduce comes first for a good reason: it's better to not create waste than to have to figure out what to do with it. And recycling, like any other form of manufacturing, uses energy and other resources while creating pollution and greenhouse gases.\n\nRather, we need to make products more durable, lighter, more energy efficient and easier to repair rather than to replace. Finally, we need to reduce and reuse packaging.\nGarbage Will Overwhelm Us\n\n Myth: There's a garbage crisis. The original garbage crisis occurred when people first settled down to farm and could no longer leave their campsites after their garbage grew too deep. \n\nSince then, every society has had to figure out what to do with discards. That something was usually unhealthy, odiferous and ugly -- throwing garbage in the streets, piling it up just outside of town, incorporating it into structures or simply setting it on fire.\n\nToday we can design history's and the world's safest recycling facilities, landfills and incinerators. We even have a national glut of landfill capacity, thanks to the fact that we've been building large regional landfills to replace older, smaller local dumps.\n\nThe problem is political. No one wants to spend money on just getting rid of garbage or to have a garbage site in the backyard. \n\nThe obvious solution is to stop generating so much garbage in the first place. Doing so requires both the knowledge and self-discipline to conserve energy and to do more with less stuff.\nIndustry Is To Blame\n\n Myth: It's all industry's fault. No, it's all people's fault. Certainly industry has played a significant role in destroying habitats, generating pollution and depleting resources. But we're the ones who signal businesses that what they're doing is acceptable -- every time we open our wallets.\n\nAnd don't just blame industrial societies. In his recent book \"Earth Politics,\" Ernst Ulrich von Weizsacker wrote that \"perhaps 90 percent of the extinction of species, soil erosion, forest and wilderness destruction and also desertification are taking place in developing countries.\" Thus, even non-industrialized, subsistence economies are creating environmental havoc.\nThe Earth Is in Peril\n\n Myth: We have to save the earth. Frankly, the earth doesn't need to be saved. \n\nNature doesn't give a hoot if human beings are here or not. The planet has survived cataclysmic and catastrophic changes for millions upon millions of years. Over that time, it is widely believed, 99 percent of all species have come and gone while the planet has remained.\n\nSaving the environment is really about saving our environment -- making it safe for ourselves, our children and the world as we know it. If more people saw the issue as one of saving themselves, we would probably see increased motivation and commitment to actually doing so.\nPackaging Is the Problem\n\n Myth: Packaging accounts for a growing percentage of our solid waste. If you were to examine a dumpster of garbage from the 1950's and a dumpster of garbage from the 1980's, you would find more discarded packaging in the first one. Packaging has actually decreased as a proportion of all solid wastes -- from more than half in the 1950's to just over one-third today.\n\nOne reason is that there was more of other kinds of wastes -- old appliances, magazines, office paper -- in the 1980's. But the main causes were two changes in the packaging industry.\n\nFirst, the heavy metal cans and glass bottles of the 1950's gave way to far lighter and more crushable containers -- about 22 percent lighter by the 1980's. At the same time, many metal and glass containers were replaced by paper boxes and plastic bottles and bins, which are even lighter and more crushable.\n\nSecond, the carrying capacity of packages -- the quantity of product that can be delivered per ounce of packaging material -- increased hugely. \n\nGlass, for example, has a carrying capacity of 1.2, meaning that 1.2 fluid ounces of milk or juice are delivered for every ounce of glass in which they are contained. Plastic containers have a carrying capacity of about 30.\nAmericans Are Wasting More\n\n Myth: Americans are over-consumers, since the per capita creation of solid waste continues to climb.  Each person generates about 4.4 pounds of garbage a day -- a number that has been growing steadily. The implication is that we partake in an unstoppable orgy of consumption. The truth is far more mundane.\n\nIn reality, increases in solid waste are based largely on the mathematics of households, not individuals. That's because regardless of the size of a household, fixed activities and purchases generate trash.\n\nAs new households form, they create additional garbage. Think about a couple going through a divorce. Once there was one home. Now there are two. Building that second house or condo used lots of resources and created lots of construction debris. Where once there was one set of furniture, one washing machine and one refrigerator, now there are two. Each refrigerator contains milk cartons, meat wrappers and packages of mixed vegetables. Each pantry contains cereal boxes and canned goods.\n\nTo make matters worse, households are growing at a fairly rapid rate, almost double the rate of population growth. That's because we're all living longer and away from our children, divorcing more frequently and becoming far more accepting of single-parent households.\n\nCensus Bureau numbers tell this story: From 1972 to 1987, the population grew by 16 percent. The number of households grew by 35 percent. Municipal solid waste increased by 35 percent, too. \n\nIf Americans were really creating more trash by overindulging, we would be spending more on trash-generating items: nondurable goods like food and cosmetics. These all generate lots of garbage, since they are used and discarded quickly, along with their packaging. But household expenditures for nondurable goods, as measured by constant dollars, declined slightly from 1972 to 1987 -- by about one-half of 1 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\nDoes all of this mean we can sit back and relax? No. The earth's resources are finite. Habitats are being destroyed. Biodiversity is declining. And the consumption of resources is expanding.\n\nBut it does mean that we must be less willing to accept glib, ideological pronouncements of right and wrong, good and evil, cause and effect. Thus, to truly change the world for the better, we need more facts, not simply more faith.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950121","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/nyregion/bridge-327795.html","abstract":"  Sixty years ago there was a young actress in New York City named Ann Gallagher.
