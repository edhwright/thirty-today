But despite the addition of these amenities to the 14-building project over the years, the quality of life there has declined considerably, residents say. And that is because it has been invaded by a small-scale, but very destructive drug trade.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"Bosnian Army and Serbs Agree to End Sniper Fire in Sarajevo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/world/bosnian-army-and-serbs-agree-to-end-sniper-fire-in-sarajevo.html","abstract":"  The Government and leaders of the Bosnian Serbs signed an agreement today to end the sniper fire that has killed thousands of people, including hundreds of children, in Sarajevo.

Both musicians approach their work with an energy and spirit that keep their performances involving. But that aside, they seem to live at different ends of the interpretive spectrum.    Ms. McDermott tends to work within conventional notions about Classical style, where she finds sufficient leeway to make her case. In a consistently graceful account of Mozart's Piano Quartet in E flat (K. 493), she exploited the breadth of the music's possibilities, sometimes giving the piano line an almost vocal shape and coloration and sometimes playing with a more aggressive pianistic sparkle. The Orion players matched her approach move for move, particularly in the finale, where the interplay between lines is strongest and where the character of the music is the most changeable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"Train Wreck in Caucasus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/world/train-wreck-in-caucasus.html","abstract":"  A passenger train smashed into a parked freight train on a stretch of track where the signals were broken, killing 12 people and injuring 20, officials said today.

It's surprising that it has taken so long, considering that the hybrid called bhangra, a mix of harvest festival music from Punjab in Northern India and reggae, rap, techno and club music, actually comes from England. Like hip-hop, bhangra has become a way for a minority culture -- in this case, Indians born in Britain -- to find identity and empowerment through its own music.   XLNC (pronounced \"excellency\") is among bhangra's youngest upstarts. On Thursday, its dance music, powered by the adrenaline tempos of the two-headed dholak drum and the larger, congalike dhol drum, insured that the dance floor remained a sea of waving arms and airborne dollar bills the entire night. Harbajan Singh Talwar and Dave Singh sang mostly in Punjabi, but also in Hindi and English, closing almost every song with rousing chants of \"Hey!\" Mr. Talwar, in particular, had a resonant voice that soared majestically over the band's good-time grooves.

When Sabine Kupferberg reached 40, she decided she was tired of performing and moved over to coaching with the Nederlands Dans Theater, where she had danced for 15 years. This week Miss van Hamel and Miss Kupferberg return to the stage at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., for performances with the Nederlands Dans Theater 3, familiarly known as N.D.T.3.    The brainchild of Jiri Kylian, the choreographer and director of the Nederlands Dans Theater, the troupe is a company of four dancers who made names for themselves but then arrived at an age considered old for ballet. There tends to be more leeway for modern dancers. Ballet today, though, requires a level of pyrotechnical skill that is beyond the reach of most dancers in their 40's and older.  But experience burnishes and deepens performing skills. And so Mr. Kylian, who founded the company in 1991, invited choreographers to create pieces tailored to those dancers' well-honed gifts. It was \"an idea\" as much as a company, he said in a statement at the company's first performance, a project that would make use of \"the specific quality and understanding of the interpreter at this very point of his or her life, not before and not after.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"Clubs Stand to Lose More Than They'll Save","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/sports/baseball-clubs-stand-to-lose-more-than-they-ll-save.html","abstract":"  On an industry-wide basis, the 28 major league clubs will lose more money in lost gate receipts, concessions and parking ($300 million) than they will save in players' salaries they don't pay ($260 million) if the strike wipes out the rest of the season.

Other topics to be explored during the season are transcendentalism in American music, different ways of looking at Bach and musical responses to life in Weimar Germany and in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Each concert is preceded by a lecture or a recital.   The orchestra, facing demographic changes and a dwindling audience in Brooklyn and increased competition for its Manhattan audience, began reconsidering its programming three seasons ago, when Dennis Russell Davies became principal conductor. Last season, the orchestra reconfigured its programs more radically, settling on concrete themes and expanding on them in chamber music performances, discussions and multi-media presentations. As a result, ticket sales increased by 47 percent, said Joseph Horowitz, the orchestra's executive director.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"Dealing With Sex Offenders","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/opinion/dealing-with-sex-offenders.html","abstract":"  It was a genuine tragedy when 33-year-old Jesse Timmendequas talked 7-year-old Megan Kanka into entering his house in Hamilton Township, N.J., one day last month. Mr. Timmendequas had been convicted twice for sexually assaulting young girls, and had served six years in a facility for sex offenders. Once Megan was in the house he strangled her to death and raped her.   Small wonder that the angry residents of Megan's town and much of New Jersey's political leadership want to crack down on sex offenders who have served their time in jail and been released back into the community. Proposals range from requiring released sex offenders to register with the police departments of the towns they settle in, to requiring that they report their whereabouts every 30 days, to making them spend the rest of their lives in prison unless they can convince officials that they have been rehabilitated. Under one proposal, the police would be alerted and asked to notify neighborhood residents of a sex offender's presence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"TENNIS;\nPlease Repeat After Edberg: Chang Wins Thiftway Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/sports/tennis-please-repeat-after-edberg-chang-wins-thiftway-again.html","abstract":"Michael Chang repeated as champion at the Thriftway ATP Championship today, beating a shockingly bad Stefan Edberg, 6-2, 7-5.\n\n\"I just could not find the range on the court,\" the second-seeded Edberg said of his 29 unforced errors.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940815","headline":"El Salvador Hasn't Purged Itself of War Crimes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/15/opinion/l-el-salvador-hasn-t-purged-itself-of-war-crimes-952494.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Dealing With War Crimes\" (editorial, Aug. 4), on Rwanda, you cite recent experience in El Salvador as a model, where, in your view, the \"sacrifice of justice to promote social peace can be morally justified.\"   What the Salvadoran experience demonstrates is that there is no substitute for a people coming to terms itself with a painful period of state-sponsored violence.

Perhaps most important, he has repeated again and again that he will observe a basic democratic mandate that has gone untested in Mexico since his Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, was formed in 1929: Mr. Salinas, who is barred from re-election under the Constitution, says he will turn over power to whoever wins a fair vote regardless of the party the victor represents.

It is built of a hundred billion nerve cells sheathed and nourished by a trillion supporting cells. And projecting from every neuron is a delicate communications cable called an axon that splits and branches and splits again, like the crown of a great spreading oak, allowing that one nerve cell to cry out through synaptic conduits to a thousand others of its kind. All told, there are more synaptic connections encased within a single skull than there are stars flung across the universe.    Neuroscientists who study the developing brain have long sought to understand just how that extraordinary neuronal circuitry gets wired up in the first place. They have struggled to identify the signals responsible for axonal guidance -- for steering the tender and tentative axon of a young nerve cell through the pandemonium of the growing brain and over to its appropriate target. Once the tip of the axon has found its correct resting spot, it can begin forming synaptic linkups with as many neurons in the neighborhood as it needs to contact to get its message across. And only with its axons in place can a brain begin to register the world around it: to see, to think, to feel, to know itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940816","headline":"Review/Fashion; Exotic Swimsuits That Shape the Body","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/style/review-fashion-exotic-swimsuits-that-shape-the-body.html","abstract":"  Romancing the swimsuit has helped Gottex build its position as a world power in beach clothes.

The all-female school, which is the subject of Kim Longinotto and Jano Williams's film, \"Dream Girls,\" was founded in 1914 and is near Osaka. Each year it produces a glitzy revue that suggests a demure, ritualized mixture of a Las Vegas floor show, a Ziegfeld-style Broadway extravaganza and a cross-dressed beauty pageant.   \"Dream Girls,\" which opens today at Film Forum, is a 50-minute documentary that pointedly illustrates the ways the Takarazuka school and revue reflect Japanese puritanism and sexual politics. Depending on their vocal registers and physiques, the students are assigned to male or female roles in the school's much-admired productions. In these shows, the girls who impersonate men become the stars.
