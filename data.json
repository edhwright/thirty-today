For no matter when you board, traveling with infants in arms or toddlers in tow is anything but refined. \n\nI'll admit there were advantages to preboarding. We got first crack at the magazines. (The airlines actually subscribe to many periodicals in addition to The Economist.) And we were greeted at our seats by gapingly empty overhead compartments -- essential, given that we had already checked the stroller, car seats and portable crib and were hoping somehow to cram overhead the various duffels too numerous to be checked.

To follow its arguments, first separate the music intended for four hands at one piano from music for four hands at two.

The dichotomies run like this: private versus public, intimate versus extravagant or domestic versus marketplace.

But television in its commercial form is often little more than a conduit for violent melodrama and tabloid sensationalism that puts itself forward as \"news.\" Much of the country's most distinguished news, arts and educational programming is produced not by the networks or their cable cousins, but by the Public Broadcasting System. The fruit is free to the citizenry, except for a tiny subsidy that Congress gives the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.    It would be foolish, even barbaric, to cripple the C.P.B. Yet that is precisely what many in the incoming Republican Congress would like to do. They need to hold their fire.

Fromm, $16.95. The author met the painter and his onetime mistress Dora Maar toward the end of World War II. He entered their lives brazenly, exited from them acrimoniously, and had intense relationships with both individuals in between. The result is \"a wickedly perceptive and daring book,\" James R. Mellow said here last year.  GHOSTS By John Banville. Vintage International, $11. The world of fine art becomes the world of fiction in this novel, which takes place on an unnamed island. All the characters are somehow interested in imagery -- the cast includes an art forger, a photographer and several art historians -- and all are not quite what they seem, including the narrator, who appeared in Mr. Banville's previous novel, \"The Book of Evidence.\" Last year our reviewer, Wendy Lesser, said, \"The achievement of 'Ghosts' is to use words as brushstrokes, to create in language an artwork that has all the appeal of a complex painting.\"  BIG BLUES: The Unmaking of IBM By Paul Carroll. Crown, $14. The author shows how I.B.M.'s rigid policies and company culture failed to keep pace with the times, with the resultant loss of dominance in the personal computer market. It is \"a detailed and devastating portrait,\" William Taylor said here last year.  GARBAGE By A. R. Ammons. Norton, $9. Winner of a National Book Award, this poem is a long ode to trash -- but it is also an autobiographical meditation and a reflection on humanity, which is, the poet points out not uncharitably, a form of garbage, too. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hirsch, said, \"In this major new installment to his life work, A. R. Ammons has given us an American testament.\" Mortality and trash are also subjects explored in THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI, by Italo Calvino, translated by Tim Parks (Vintage International, $10). In these five essays detailing his life and development as a writer, Calvino reflects on language and the significance of events like the disposal of rubbish, which he calls \"an offering made to the underworld.\" The book is \"a provocative reminder of how truly international\" Calvino's writing is, Lawrence Venuti said here last year.  FIMA By Amos Oz. Translated by Nicholas de Lange. Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.95. This novel charts the transformation through tragedy of the man of the title, a 54-year-old Israeli whose political commitments and promise as a poet have, like his marriage, dwindled away. Last year our reviewer, Francine Prose, said the author \"succeeds in making us believe in the particular, individual life of this man.\"  THE WHOLE TEN YARDS By Frank Gifford and Harry Waters Jr. Ivy, $5.99. Those who can tear themselves away from televised football long enough to read about the sport will find several new paperbacks, like this autobiography of the man who gained celebrity first as a star player for the New York Giants and then as an ABC-TV commentator. His book \"will attract even more\" attention, Michael Swindle said here last year. A player who had talent but not discipline is remembered in 3RD DOWN AND FOREVER: Joe Don Looney and the Rise and Fall of an American Hero, by J. Brent Clark (St. Martin's, $12.95). Looney, who appeared to have a sure future in professional football, threw it away through erratic and rebellious behavior. Last year our reviewer, Michael Lichtenstein, called the book \"a compassionate, sensitive account of a frustrated life.\" There's a happier story in TURNING THE THING AROUND: Pulling America's Team Out of the Dumps -- and Myself Out of the Doghouse, by Jimmy Johnson as told to Ed Hinton (Hyperion, $14.95). This memoir by the former coach of the Dallas Cowboys chronicles Mr. Johnson's early career as well as his stint with Dallas, which began inauspiciously but ended with Super Bowl glory. \"Perhaps best of all is a chapter entitled 'Hair,' \" Charles Salzberg said here last year.  LOVE, STARS, AND ALL THAT By Kirin Narayan. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $10. This first novel describes the long pursuit of the perfect mate, beginning with a meeting in Berkeley, Calif., between the heroine, a graduate student from India, and a local poet. Earlier this year our reviewer, Bapsi Sidhwa, called it \"an engaging portrait.\"  VARIATIONS ON NIGHT AND DAY By Abdelrahman Munif. Translated by Peter Theroux. Vintage International, $12. Set in the 1930's in a fictional desert land that is obviously Saudi Arabia, this novel depicts the fortunes of Sultan Khureybit, a character patterned after the real desert chieftain and king Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. This final volume in the author's \"Cities of Salt\" trilogy allows the reader to \"get to know something of the desert itself,\" Fouad Ajami said here last year.  THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD By Lawrence Block. Avon, $5.99. This Matthew Scudder mystery has the unlicensed private eye coming to the aid of a mentally unstable derelict accused of murdering a yuppie lawyer. Earlier this year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called this \"streetwise sleuth . . . just about the best there is.\"  ALBURQUERQUE By Rudolfo Anaya. Warner, $5.99. A young man of mixed Indian and Anglo ancestry learns of his true parentage in this novel, which takes place during a bitter mayoral race in Albuquerque, N.M., once called Alburquerque.

Hollywood has been tickling and irritating the national fancy ever since. In AMERICAN CINEMA: One Hundred Years of Filmmaking (Rizzoli, $50), Jeanine Basinger, who teaches film studies at Wesleyan University, has combined informative text and sumptuous photographs to tell the story of movies, beginning in earnest with the definitive victory of sound over silence around 1928. A knowledgeable guide, Ms. Basinger briskly, if somewhat pedantically, covers all her subject's angles. She cuts quickly, for example, from a glance at technical tricks of the trade to a thumbnail discussion of that glittering phenomenon known as the star. She discusses screwball comedy and film noir, and traces the decline of the studio system and the rise of conglomerates and powerful agents, with their deals and packages. Readers looking for discussion of Hollywood's treatment of minorities or of its timorous or distored responses to momentous off-screen events, however, will be disappointed.

Stella's mix of Madonnas, flowers and Caribbean landscapes were the product of a ripe and iconoclastic imagination that found inspiration in everything from the Sienese Renaissance through Marcel Duchamp. Altogether, the sleeper of the year. Another Face of Picasso -- \"Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese and Dora Maar,\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art over the summer, sounded as if it would be a mess but turned out to be a beautiful, quirky and inspiring near-mess. Even by Picasso's standards, the work was unusually personal and suggestive (of his gigantic psyche). Especially striking were the extraordinarily colored paintings from the 30's, which aren't usually thought of as his best years. Poussin as Poet -- In the last rooms in the Poussin retrospective now at the Grand Palais in Paris, as one was feeling respectful of the brainy 17th-century French master but not passionate about him, something finally clicked. It happened in front of Virgilian scenes of Arcadia like \"Landscape With Diogenes\" and awesome tempests like \"Landscape With Pyramus and Thisbe\" and in front of a touching self-portrait that reveals the artist as poet. The Great Unveiling -- Michelangelo's \"Last Judgment\" in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the cleaning of which was completed last spring, finally revealed itself as a grand, unified composition instead of the patchwork quilt it had seemed before.

The easiest way to confront the overflow is to confine oneself to the work of selected Great Composers and ignore the rest. But there is a problem: great composers do not pro duce exclusively great music. You can listen to Wagner's \"Faust\" Overture forward, backward, upside down or out on the veranda of the Villa Wahnfried, and it's still a pretty dubious piece.   And there is a corollary: great music is not exclusively produced by great composers. Think of \"Cavalleria Rusticana,\" \"The Planets,\" Korngold's \"Tote Stadt.\" Or, to go a little further astray, the Serenade for Orchestra by Wilhelm Stenhammar, a Swedish composer who lived from 1871 to 1927. This is music of effortless grace, sweet and sad in passing moods, spontaneous at every turn. It borrows some from Sibelius but not too much; it has a subtle, fine-grained Romantic voice very much its own.

The ruling, based on the State Constitution, is correct.   Though denounced as \"social engineering\" by a losing lawyer, the decision merely recognizes modern reality.

The good news was U.S. District Judge William L. Dwyer's decision in Seattle to uphold the Clinton Administration's plan for managing forests to protect fish and wildlife in the Pacific Northwest. The tactical retreat was Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt's decision to forgo higher grazing fees in an effort to save more important parts of his plan to protect the nation's public range lands from further degradation.   Judge Dwyer's decision represented a rare victory for the Administration in what has otherwise been a tough year for environmental initiatives. President Clinton promised during his campaign to find a negotiated solution to a vitriolic battle between loggers and conservationists over the old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, where years of ferocious logging had threatened the habitat for the northern spotted owl -- the little bird that provoked the whole controversy -- and other species, including salmon.

Appropriately for the Learning Channel, this 13-part expansion of a home-video version released last year is more textbookish (and considerably less moving) than Mr. Burns's epic. It is packed with information about weapons and uniforms, perhaps more than you require, along with detailed play-by-plays of battles big and little, beginning tonight with the firing on Fort Sumter and the first battle of Bull Run.

Four of the black, bat-winged planes, which cost $2.2 billion each, are flying at Whiteman, and 16 more are on the way.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941227","headline":"The Good, Bad and In-Between In a Year of Surprises on Film","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/27/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-good-bad-and-in-between-in-a-year-of-surprises-on-film.html","abstract":"  Flukes set the standard for 1994 on screen. While big films (\"Wyatt Earp\") and even big seasons (Christmas) fizzled, the triumphs came out of extreme left field. Foreign films were in serious decline, but American independent cinema experienced a burst of creative fervor. And, of course, Gump happened. More about that in a moment.   While 1994 was short on major fireworks, it brought so many solid successes that this year's 10-best list includes a dozen entries. Arithmetic should never matter more than merit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941227","headline":"Alexandria, and in Just One Volume","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/27/books/books-of-the-times-alexandria-and-in-just-one-volume.html","abstract":"  OUT OF EGYPT A Memoir  By Andre Aciman  340 pages.

His doctors at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., revived him after heroic efforts. But a few weeks later, they decided that aggressive medical care would only prolong his suffering and that he would never survive infancy. They suggested that his life support be withdrawn.   His parents refused, setting off an emotional battle over the baby's medical care. In the two months since his birth, Ryan Nguyen (pronounced win) has become a cause celebre in the Pacific Northwest.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19941227","headline":"Israel Offers a Good Alternative to Orphanages","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/27/opinion/l-israel-offers-a-good-alternative-to-orphanages-220795.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The debate sparked by Representative Newt Gingrich between foster care and orphanages assumes that these severely flawed choices are our only ones. Foster care is less expensive and closer to real family life, but subject to corruption and the abuse of the children.

One school holds that a massive object from outer space slammed into the Earth, kicking up a worldwide pall of dust that blotted out the Sun and killed off many plants and animals. The other school prefers to seek the cause of the global mayhem in natural processes like big volcanic eruptions.   Each side has accumulated a lot of evidence to support its case, though lately the advocates of an asteroid collision seem to have had the upper hand.   Now, however, an elegant theory has been proposed that neatly combines both conflicting ideas into a single mechanism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19941227","time":"1994-12-27
