The question for the Court today was whether the racketeering law, known as RICO, requires proof that the defendants -- in this case, Operation Rescue and a coalition of clinic protest groups called the Pro-Life Action League -- were motivated by a desire for economic gain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931209","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/09/style/chronicle-081093.html","abstract":"  Why bother to go out to a movie that will soon be shown on television?    \"I think it's a bit of an imposition to ask people to come here to see something sitting up that they could see lying down,\" CATHERINE WYLER acknowledged on Tuesday at the premiere in Washington of a film she produced, \"Hot on the Trail, the Search for Sex and Romance in the Old West . . . and the New.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931209","headline":"Willem C.

Also, for those corrupt \"black\" attorneys who not only refuse to help me but tried to steal my car. Also those so-called civil right leader such as the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, C. Vernon Mason, and Calvin Butts. Also the racism of Mark Martin and the Legal Aid Society and court system. Also racism of Attorney Ms. Abramson of the law firm of Gaffin & Mayo on Broadway in Manhattan.                    . . .         Reasons for this: Adelphi University's racism, the EEOC's racism, workers' compensation's racism, NYC transit police, NYC police, the racism of Gov. Cuomo's staff and exec. chamber, the racism of the lieutenant governor's staff and exec chamber, that includes Susan (indecipherable) and Carol (indecipherable). Those filthy swine that live at 226 Martense Street, Bklyn, are not my friends. Once they hear of this, they will loot all the evidence in my room, such as documents and tapes. I hate them with a passion.  FROM LETTER  TO COMMISSIONER KELLY  Dear Sir:   Please be advised that Mr. Colin Ferguson has contacted us, his close friends in the \"black\" professional community, to advise and assist him regarding his numerous requests for the immediate return of all documents, records, photographs, fingerprints, and negatives, related to his racist and false arrest of Feb. 17, 1992. This, of course, constituted the first arrest of Mr. Ferguson's life.   A review of the documents in our possession revealed the racism and corruption within your agency, as you attempt to deny Mr. Ferguson the fundamental guarantees provided for under our system. . . .    The above mentioned arrest was particularly viscous and racist for the following reasons:   1) Mr. Ferguson had been sitting in the same well defined seat on the #1 train for eight (8) or more stops before his racist caucasian accuser and her racist caucasion female friend boarded the train demanding that Mr. Ferguson move over.   2) The accuser was not denied a seat, since she did sit down. She knew that the row of seats on that train does not accommodate its capacity comfortably, especially in the winter when commuters overdress.   3) The two racist caucasian police officers pushed Mr. Ferguson to the platform violently where he sustained shock and bruises.   4) A caucasian man with a pitbull on the subway platform impersonating a police officer had his dog jump on Mr. Ferguson's chest. He was allowed to go free although thirty or more commuters demanded that he be arrested.   5) The twelve (12) caucasian police officers refused to take the names of the fifteen (15) or so witnesses who came forward for Mr. Ferguson.   6) The N.Y.C. Transit Police has consistently engaged in a racist campaign of targeting \"blacks\" using the subway system in an effort to improve arrest statistics within the subway, which is then publicized with the hope that more caucasians will utilize the subway system.   7) Copies of Mr. Ferguson's photographs were given to his accuser and her friend by the police officers so that in the event the matter went to trial, the accusers could circulate the photographs to friends, thereby accumulating false witnesses to lie under oath and perhaps for future frame ups.   It should be noted that we have experienced the unpleasant duty of conferencing this matter with a deeply concerned young man, whose attempt to overcome dismay appears frustrated by a course of action calculated to disrupt his life, lend to the furtherance of slander, and libel and effect a future frame up. . . .   We hope that your office recognizes that Mr. Ferguson's ability to proceed with his normal day to day activities have been tremendously affected. . . .   Yours truly, Approved and accepted by: Colin Ferguson","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931209","headline":"Blaming the Victims : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/09/opinion/IHT-blaming-the-victims-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Many Muslim women in the former Yugoslavia live in fear of being called upon to testify at the United Nations war crimes trials in The Hague.

Although Ms. Estefan is a competent singer who exudes a likable sincerity and can communicate a certain wistfulness, she is too bland a stylist to put an indelible personal stamp on any of the 11 songs on her Christmas album. The record begins pretentiously with an overture followed by pleasant, straightforward readings of mostly familiar songs arranged in twinkly pop settings lightly seasoned with Latin and pop-funk rhythms. \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" is sung mostly a cappella with Singers Unlimited, in a Hi-Lo's-style jazz vocal arrangement. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" uses a boys' choir. There is a bilingual (English and Spanish) \"Silent Night\" and an all-Spanish \"Arbolito de Navidad.\" STEPHEN HOLDEN","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931210","headline":"Reviews/Film; Doubts About a Husband Who May Be a Serial Killer","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/10/movies/reviews-film-doubts-about-a-husband-who-may-be-a-serial-killer.html","abstract":"English housewife fears spouse is serial killer.

Stalin was the one who drafted an army of Socialist Realists, as he called them.

Yeltsin, has ostentatiously stayed aloof from the race, neither forming a party nor endorsing any of the 13 blocs competing for seats in Parliament.   When Mr. Yeltsin did finally address the electorate on television this evening, it was to issue an impassioned plea to support his draft constitution, which has come under considerable fire for giving the President too much power. Unless the constitution is adopted, he warned, the new Parliament will collapse into new power struggles and Russia could again come to the brink of civil war.   The President seemed almost disdainful of the race for Parliament, and his only advice to voters was to support \"responsible and honest\" candidates and not those filled with hate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19931210","headline":"Mass Murder on the 5:33","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/10/opinion/mass-murder-on-the-5-33.html","abstract":"  Consider some multiple murders, committed over the last few years, and the headlines that might describe them: Deranged Gunman Kills 22 in Killeen, Tex.

The first Mama Rose was Ethel Merman, using her last appearance in a Broadway show to crown a legendary career with her most memorable performance. In the process, she bequeathed a fearsome hurdle to all subsequent productions. A movie version of \"Gypsy,\" starring Rosalind Russell, never stood a chance.

For Uncle Tupelo, a trio from Belleville, Ill., who will perform this weekend in Hoboken, N.J., it's a code word for the kind of music that makes you feel better. The band's two lead singers and songwriters, Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy, have an obvious affinity for some of the most soul-stirring moments in country and rock history: \"Anodyne\" (Sire/ Reprise) has the rustic lilt of an old Hank Williams tune, the harmonic grace of the Flying Burrito Brothers, the loose rumble of the Rolling Stones' \"Exile on Main Street.\"   From the pointedly unpolished production, crackling with fiddle, mandolin and pedal steel guitar, to songs like \"Chickamauga\" (named after the Civil War battle site), \"Anodyne\" is intentionally retro, an homage to mythically purer times. Mr. Farrar and Mr. Tweedy's allegiance to their roots borders on fetishism: they have even written an ode to Acuff-Rose, the company that published Hank Williams's material. \"Name me a song that everybody knows, and I'll bet you it belongs to Acuff-Rose,\" Mr. Tweedy sings in his self-effacing twang.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931210","headline":"Holiday Noises, Joyful and Otherwise, on Disk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/10/arts/holiday-noises-joyful-and-otherwise-on-disk.html","abstract":"Here are reviews of 21 Christmas albums selected by New York Times pop critics.

Of this album's seven previously unreleased songs, Marvin Gaye's \"Purple Snowflakes\" is silly and Diana Ross's version of \"This Christmas\" is surprisingly unpretentious. But an all but forgotten Motown singer, Kim Weston, has the prize. Her \"Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" recorded in 1962, is plaintive and stark with holiday blues. Gaye's funky instrumental \"Christmas in the City,\" recorded in 1972, sounds as if it's from the score of a blaxploitation movie.

The egos are under control. For whatever reason, the personalities have blended better than anyone could have expected. As the Giants play mix-and-match with players and positions, one wonders how they've been able to remain among the best in the National Football League.   In retrospect, it's easy to see why Dan Reeves cut the ties with Pepper Johnson. When Johnson declared that he didn't want to play outside linebacker, he just about signed his death warrant. This defense relies on players who are flexible, players who may be asked to make difficult adjustments for the good of the team.

When BeBe sings \"White Christmas,\" he does it with warm reminiscence, and when he lets his deep voice really soar, it becomes full-bodied and, as in \"Ooh Child,\" bittersweet. Steadied by hand-claps and the resonant voices of Mom and Pop Winans, \"Ooh Child\" is one of the songs that come close to sounding like soul-saving music. Of the new songs, \"Give Me a Star\" is the most elating. The crisp background vocals are so rapturous you can envision a robed group stepping from side to side and clapping in time. CeCe's voice shines on \"Joy to the World\" and in other tunes, but this album belongs to BeBe.

The hopes ignited by the declaration were mocked by tyrannies and dictatorships, all asserting that their abuses were an internal affair. With the end of the cold war and third-world bloc voting, the U.N. can no longer indulge that excuse.

Reacting to polls that show Americans more fearful of violent crime and to Tuesday's carnage on the Long Island Rail Road, the Clinton Administration tentatively embraced a proposal to require all gun owners to be licensed.

SEEKING WAYS TO PREVENT SEXUAL ABUSE   The city's Board of Education established a 50-member commission to find new ways to track, investigate and prevent sexual abuse of children by school staff members. B3.   Mayor-elect Giuliani called on New Yorkers to give more support to the police. B3.

In this appealing mixture of big-band swing and pop sentiment, Mr. Connick assumes almost every musical task. He sings, plays the piano and conducts the band in his own arrangements. The 14 songs include four originals, each strikingly different. \"When My Heart Finds Christmas\" is an all-purpose holiday ballad, and \"It Must've Been Ol' Santa Claus\" is an amusing novelty about a cynical grown-up who learns to believe in Santa Claus. \"The Blessed Dawn of Christmas Day\" is a religious carol, and \"I Pray on Christmas\" a doo-wop style ballad. High points include a punchily swinging \"Sleigh Ride\" and a playful \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" in which Mr. Connick sings call-and-response with a children's chorus. There are also some heavy-handed moments; the most glaring is Mr. Connick's turgid, dissonant string arrangement for \"What Child Is This?\" But on the whole, the album maintains a delightful balance between fun and reverence.

It was Minnesota's first National Hockey League game since Norm Green moved the North Stars to Dallas after last season. It also was the first regular-season game ever at Minneapolis's Target Center, which is trying to lure the Oilers from Edmonton. (AP) Canucks 3, Bruins 2: Cliff Ronning's 40-foot slap shot over the left shoulder of Boston goalie Jon Casey only 37 seconds into overtime gave Vancouver the victory over the Bruins in Boston Garden. The goal, which appeared to have been deflected off a Bruins player in front of the net, sent Boston to its third consecutive loss. (AP) Red Wings 3, Blues 2: Detroit, with Sergei Fedorov getting a goal and an assist, scored the last three goals in a comeback victory over St. Louis at Joe Louis Arena. It was the fifth straight road loss for the Blues (14-9-5), who were outshot by 45-19. The Red Wings (14-12-2), who have won their last four at home, went two games over .500 for the first time all season. (AP) Capitals 4, Flyers 2: Keith Jones scored twice as visiting Washington beat Philadelphia for the first time in six tries this season. The Capitals have three victories in their last 12 games (3-7-2) while Philadelphia has lost three of its last four and is 5-6-1 without Eric Lindros, their injured center. Mike Ridley of Washington broke a 2-2 tie with 10:18 remaining in the third period. (AP) TENNIS Steven's Dollar Days  Brett Steven won the biggest paycheck of his career and went home. Michael Stich took the money and the victory. Stich, the defending champion, came from behind to beat Steven, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, yesterday in the quarterfinals of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich, Germany. Stefan Edberg, seeded No. 2, also reached the semifinals, beating Wayne Ferreira, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 6-0. Edberg had never got past the first round in two previous appearances in the Grand Slam Cup. Steven qualified for the 16-man event when Richard Krajicek dropped out because of an injury. Ranked 43d in the world and a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open, Steven has never won a tournament, but the New Zealander picked up $262,500 and nearly doubled his 1993 earnings after reaching the quarterfinals. (AP) YACHT RACING A Winner in Whitbread  The European yacht Intrum Justitia entered Fremantle harbor in Australia yesterday to win the 7,558-mile second leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race. In breaking the record time for the leg by two and a half days, Intrum Justitia, a Whitbread-60 Class yacht skippered by Lawrie Smith of England, took 25 days 14 hours 39 minutes to complete the stage, which began Nov. 13 in Punta del Este, Uruguay.

The debaters quoted are Robert H. Bork, the former Federal judge (for the resolution), and Prof. Linda S. Greene of the University of Wisconsin Law School (against).   BORK -- Political correctness, I think, is something that is widespread in this society, and it's part of a mood of radical egalitarianism which has taken hold. Of course, equality does not occur for all people without coercion.  And I'm afraid that's what we're seeing. We're seeing it in affirmative action and quotas in the universities.  And we're seeing it in the speech codes, which are judging speech not by what it objectively means, but by how somebody perceives it, over which the speaker has no control.    And I think this kind of leveling in speech and of rejection of the achievement principle for quotas isn't going to work. This kind of thing, I think, leads to hostility, a loss of civility and a rejection of the achievement principle upon which this society is really based.   GREENE -- P.C. is a menace, but perhaps for different reasons than the other side would say. It's a menace because it obscures the real problems and issues that we face as a society.  It's a clever rhetorical phrase which turns a debate about racism and sexism into a debate about censorship.   If you can force us to discuss censorship instead of discussing racial epithets, censorship instead of discussing sexual harassment, censorship instead of discussing the question how we are going to transform our institutions into more diverse places, then you have set the terms of the debate and prevented a discussion of the real issues. And it seems to be a great cause of glee on the right, among conservatives, that they have been able to change this debate.    Let's stop attacking young people who come to college, whose parents send them to college with a reasonable expectation that they won't be the victims of racist, derogatory speech. Let's stop attacking the victims and start attacking the problem of racism. P.C. labels prevent that.  The P.C. charge prevents that, and that's why P.C. is a menace. Let's eliminate the phrase and get on with the unfinished business of transforming our society and transforming our educational institutions.   BORK -- Professor Greene, do you think there is more racism in this society today than there was 30 or 40 years ago?   GREENE -- I think that racism has changed its character. I think that racism still exists but its character is different. I think we have two types of racism going on, or at least two. In one type we see the explicit racist remark or the explicit racial decision, sometimes because of an inadvertent slip. Other times we have a veiled racism, not necessarily the product of a person's specific intent, but an unconscious comfort which we have with the status quo.    What we need to do is not to focus on calling each other racist or sexist, but instead to try to understand how historical racism has affected our lives and consciousness and not make charges but try to understand how we all -- white, black, men and women -- have been affected by our past.   BORK -- Professor Greene, I think none of us on this side of the table disagrees that people could be punished for making open racial or ethnic insults in a university. That is not the question in which this arises. This arises when students steal a student newspaper because they regard it as racist, although it's just conservative, or when a professor is put through sensitivity training for a remark that was not really offensive in the classroom, that's political correctness, and that's what we object to and it's happening. It's not just a question of forbidding talk about racism.   GREENE -- Well, is it political correctness because the university expresses a concern? It seems to me that if we eliminate the label of political correctness from our debate, we can talk more explicitly about what speech we want to empower people to engage in.   Let's stop talking about political correctness and instead talk frankly about what we want people to be able to say at the university. Are we saying that we want students to be able to say anything they wish to another person? Are we saying that we want faculty to be free to make remarks, however offensive or threatening to their students? Are we saying that we want professors to be able to make sexual remarks to their students?   All I am saying is that the P.C. charge prevents us from discussing the rules of decorum in the university. I think that when you mention acts like the stealing of newspapers  [ at Penn ]  or other acts of this nature, we all understand that these acts occur in a context. I don't think we want to continue to focus on these specific incidents. I think what we need to talk about is the way that the characterization of this debate prevents us from really discussing how much freedom a professor should -- we've both been professors. I'm a professor now.  You've been a professor. You know how important it is to be free to speak and to not be misunderstood.   BORK -- Nobody on this side of the table is saying we should not discuss racism or sexism and how to deal with it.   GREENE -- Judge Bork, don't you think that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the free speech debate? We don't have an outcry over the regulation of speech in the context of stock offerings; we don't worry about regulating speech in the area of copyright, plagiarism.   Some of the conservatives are perfectly happy to suppress pornography and obscenity or other types of advertising. So how would you make the distinction between that speech which ought to be permitted and that speech which we ought to suppress?   BORK -- At the core of the First Amendment -- which I take it is the emblem of free speech in our society -- there is concern for political speech, concern for speech about ideas, about social matters, and so forth. There is no concern about speech -- at least there wasn't originally concern about speech which expresses no idea, but merely expresses hatred or obscenity or something of that sort.    If somebody says, for example, that Asian-American students turn out to be better at mathematics and physics than others, I take it a speech code might land them on that person.  That's political correctness, and that's wrong. We've got to be free to discuss differences, abilities, and so forth. But when you get to a code about a stock offering, you're merely saying don't sell somebody a product that you have lied about.   GREENE -- It seems that you're supporting the idea that we can regulate some hate speech ----   BORK -- In a university. In a university.   GREENE -- In the university. And hate speech which might be one person making a personally directed racial epithet at another person. Wouldn't you agree that that ought to be, if not punishable, certainly subject to some type of university discipline and correction?   BORK -- There certainly ought to be. I remember there was an episode at Brown University not long ago in which a drunken student went out in the quadrangle and shrieked anti-Semitic remarks, and the dean had him in and I think he was suspended. I don't have much trouble with that.    GREENE -- How do you explain that there is so much intellectual and political firepower marshaled in favor of people who want to yell epithets and derogatory, hurtful language?  How do we explain this marshaling of energy and intellect in support of people who want to act this way towards others?   BORK -- I think nobody does.   GREENE -- Well, then, would you agree with me that what we need to do is talk about the real issues and stop hurling our charges at each other?    BORK -- Oh, the charges are much more fun.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931211","headline":"Isles Call Up A Goaltender","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/11/sports/hockey-isles-call-up-a-goaltender.html","abstract":"  The Islanders yesterday called up goaltender Jamie McLellan from their Salt Lake City minor league affiliate on an emergency basis because of a back injury suffered by Tom Draper during his off-ice conditioning session on Wednesday.
