NEIL STRAUSS Still Improvising    Derek Bailey Quartet, the Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. In the 1980 book \"Improvisation,\" the guitarist Derek Bailey contends that improvisation is the most widely practiced musical activity, but the least acknowledged and understood. He ought to know. As a pick-up musician in the 1950's and a studio musician in the 1960's, he learned a lot about discipline and restriction before striking out on his own in search of freedom. Three decades later, he's still twisting his tuning pegs, whittling atonal guitar lines, and breaking for periods of silence. He has become one of the most technically adept performers in a genre that has pretty much remained unacknowledged and misunderstood. He performs with the saxophonist Peter Brotzmann, the drummer Gregg Bendian and the bassist Skuli Sverrisson tonight and tomorrow night at 10. Admission: $10. N.

Led by Ben Daughtrey, a reformed hardcore rock musician, Love Jones croons self-consciously slick retro-rock songs colored with light brush strokes of bossa nova, soul and doo-wop. The band sometimes tries too hard to imitate a style of music characterized by its effortlessness, but that's only part of its charm. Doors open at 8 P.M. admission is $8. N.

The first Rodney King trial reminded the nation of all that can go wrong when all-white juries sit in judgment of black defendants or victims. And studies show that black jurors are less trusting than whites of police testimony and more apt to side with the defendant.

Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority, and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion. Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate counseling. Any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process.

The annual telecast celebrates MTV above all: its power to muster stars, its air of hipness, its hold on the squealing teen-age masses, its endless chain of self-reference. MTV promotes the video clips, the video clips promote the performers, the performers promote MTV.   For the 11th annual awards show, telecast live from Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night, MTV reveled in its ability to disrupt midtown traffic and crowd the sidewalks. Pitched to a younger audience and with a news booth prominently displayed on the street, the telecast enjoyed a more hysterical public response than the Grammy Awards broadcasts from the same theater.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940910","headline":"Taking On the Tough Guys: It's Idealistic, but Is It Smart?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/10/movies/film-review-taking-on-the-tough-guys-it-s-idealistic-but-is-it-smart.html","abstract":"Mob boss on trial tries to scare juror.
