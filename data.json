Receiver Rob Moore, the main target in the deep-passing game, didn't practice this afternoon because of a sprained left foot and doesn't appear fit enough to play against the Bills Sunday.   Moore's probable absence couldn't come at a worse time for the Jets. To make the playoffs, they need to win their last two games at Buffalo and Houston. That means they will have to make big plays. Although he hasn't been used in that role recently, Moore was the Jets' main deep threat early in the season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931223","headline":"The Tyranny Is Alive and Well : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/23/opinion/IHT-the-tyranny-is-alive-and-well-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding the opinion column \"Retire 'Politically Correct'\" (Dec. 7) by Brent Staples: .As a recent graduate of Tufts University,I know full well that the tyranny of political correctness is not at all \"imagined.\" News reports of wh","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931223","headline":"Holocaust Deniers Got More Than Visibility; Brandeis Statement","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/23/opinion/l-holocaust-deniers-got-more-than-visibility-brandeis-statement-741793.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Your Dec. 12 news article on a Holocaust revisionist ad published in the Brandeis University student-run newspaper distorted my statement by excerpting it.

It will be hard to find a better party anywhere. The band, whether it's New Year's Eve or not, take the idea of carnival, of excess and celebration, to the limit. They'll play a weird hybrid of country, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll, with the Beach Boys and Sun Ra thrown in for some surrealism. They'll be joined by Terrance Simien and his Mallet Playboys, a rocking Louisiana zydeco band. There are two shows: the first, at 7 P.M., costs $20; the second, at 11 P.M., costs $40 and includes a Champagne toast at midnight. Both shows have a two-drink minimum. PETER WATROUS Rhythm and Reggae    Rosco Gordon, 200 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-2925. The pianist, singer and songwriter, best known for his rhythm-and-blues hits \"No More Doggin' \" and \"Just a Little Bit,\" helped invent reggae in the late 1950's and early 1960's with his off-balance, syncopated sense of rhythm. Then he vanished, only to turn up over the last five years running a dry-cleaning business in Queens. He's a solid rhythm-and-blues performer, and a good pianist who has written some classic songs. He'll be joined by -- and this is a fine idea -- some members of the Skatalites, once Jamaica's finest studio band. The show starts at 11 P.M. There is a $10 cover and a $25 minimum. P. W. Classic Blues    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 475-0049. One of the last of the great blues shouters will treat an audience to the classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which will come with a blues nastiness to them. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. There is a $25 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Zanzibar Guitar    Matt (Guitar) Murphy, Zanzibar, 73 Eighth Avenue, near 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Before this guitarist was saddled with leading the Blues Brothers Band, from the movie of the same name, he was an exceptional blues guitarist who made James Cotton's mid-1970's band rock. He's all speed and texture, and he uses whirling lines that can cause a commotion. There are two sets, at 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. , and $75 gets you a four-course meal and Champagne, while $35 lets you stand at the bar. P. W. Time-Warped Tunes    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. White, a clarinetist, leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's polyphonic, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the raucous group improvisations that bray and holler. He has become a New Year's tradition at the Vanguard, and hearing his band invites audiences into a time warp; it makes a listener understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. P. W. Piano Man    John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. He's a florid pianist who always plays like he's never going to play again, and wants to get everything he knows in by the last chorus. He'll be backed by the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Victor Lewis, who is one of jazz's greatest living drummers. It will be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show starts at 9, and for $120 there is a five-course dinner and Champagne. From 1 to 4 A.M., the cover is $20 and there is a $15 minimum. P. W. Two Wily Veterans    Nancy Wilson and Gato Barbieri, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. Ms. Wilson can be a viscerally moving performer, one of the best singers to graduate from Dinah Washington's vocal finishing school. She can be smooth or rough and nasal, and both stances imply emotion. Mr. Barbieri is a showman whose best recordings, made in the 1960's, have a hard power. The 7 P.M. show, for $180, includes a four-course meal and Champagne. At 1 A.M., the $120 tickets include breakfast and Champagne. P. W. Ulmer Power    James Blood Ulmer, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. This year is Mr. Ulmer's fifth New Year's Eve at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes use of drones and odd tunings, is as distinct as anything that walks the planet. It's hard-rocking, slippery music, charged with power. Sets are at 9 and midnight, and the $20 cover buys a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. Dark Side Sounds    Stephen Scott, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, off Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. Mr. Scott is the most austere pianist of his generation, somebody who plays the dark side of every tune. The music comes out moody and emotional. He's anything but glib, and his sense of space is wonderfully Monkish, elegant and relaxed, yet taut. He's a young master. There are three sets, at 9 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. The $35 cover includes two drinks plus Champagne and party favors. P. W. Adderley's Band    Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best working bands in jazz features Mr. Adderley's cool sound on horn, and Vincent Herring's explosive soloing on alto and soprano saxophones. The rhythm section includes Rob Bargan on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums and it swings with authority. It's mainstream jazz at its most exciting. The show starts at 9 P.M. and $99 includes dinner, Champagne and party favors. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $25 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Trio at Zinno    Junior Mance and Kirk Lightsey, Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182. Mr. Mance, a bluesy, sophisticated pianist, will open with a solo set at 6 P.M.

The restaurant and building are for sale at an asking price of about $3.5 million.   The Coach House opened in 1949 in what had been a stable for the estate of the Wanamaker family. The restaurant, a clubby place, became a favorite of James Beard's, but was eclipsed by a new wave of American restaurants like An American Place, Gotham Bar and Grill and Arcadia.

For traditional New York glamour, the Rainbow complex on the 65th floor of the General Electric Building is hard to beat. Recent movies like \"The Prince of Tides\" and \"Six Degrees of Separation,\" which have scenes set in the Rainbow Room, have only added to its mystique. For those with the resources, it offers three different dinner-with-entertainment choices. In all three locations, the events begin at 9 P.M. At the Rainbow Room, Tommy Tune, an entertainer whose exuberance and versatility make him the one-man equivalent of an old-time movie musical (preferrably starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers), is performing his solo cabaret act. There will be dancing to the Rainbow Room Orchestra. Black tie is required, and the price is $375 a guest, including dinner, dancing and the show. Rainbow and Stars, the cabaret around the corner, will have a performance of \"The Leonard Bernstein Revue: A Helluva Town,\" the latest and one of the strongest in its series of shows saluting Broadway composers. The program includes most of Bernstein's best-known theater songs performed by singers -- Lauren Mitchell, J. Mark McVey, Patrick Quinn and Ruth Williamson -- who lend them an appropriately semi-operatic grandeur. Dress is black tie, and the price is $325 a person, including dinner, dancing and the show. The Rainbow Pavilion next door will feature a return New Year's Eve engagement by the Impalas, the Brooklyn vocal group best known for its 1959 hit, \"Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home).\" The group will alternate sets with Uptown, a six-piece pop band. Dress is black tie and the price is $325 a guest, including dinner, dancing and the show. STEPHEN HOLDEN An Alto in the Tea Room    Ann Hampton Callaway, the Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947. Ann Hampton Callaway's rich, rangy alto is arguably the most the beautiful voice in New York City's cabaret world. It is especially well suited to traditional pop ballads like \"How Deep Is the Ocean\" and \"My Foolish Heart,\" which she imbues with an almost sobbing intensity. New Year's Eve shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. There is a $45 music charge and a $30 minimum, and a $50 prix fixe menu. A la carte selections are also available. Dinner seatings are at 8 P.M. for the first show and 10:30 P.M. for the second show, which is already sold out. S. H. Brazilian Ballroom    The Raquel Lima Show, featuring Pe De Boi and Nando Gabrieli, the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-3005. The Ballroom's New Year's Eve extravaganza kicks off the club's fourth annual winter series of Brazilian music with the double bill of a hot jazz singer (Raquel Lima) and a rising young crooner (Nando Gabrieli), both of whom are appearing with a nine-member samba band, Pe De Boi. Miss Lima is an improvisatory scat singer adept in several Afro-Brazilian styles. Mr. Gabrieli, a protege of Sammy Cahn, is only 28, and has been compared with the young Frank Sinatra. The festivities begin at 10 P.M., with dancing after the show until 4 A.M. Tickets are $65 and there is a two-drink minimum. The show continues through Jan. 8 at regular prices. S. H. Come to This Cabaret    Weslia Whitfield, the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-6800, extension 159. A pop-jazz singer with impeccable taste in material and a relaxed and inviting living-room manner, Weslia Whitfield has been San Francisco's most popular cabaret performer for several years, and now she is catching on in New York. On New Year's Eve, she will introduce her new January show, \" 'S Wonderful: the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin\" at the Oak Room, where she has already appeared twice this year.  The performance is at 9:30 P.M. with dinner seating at 7:30 P.M. The price is $195 a person. That includes dinner, the performance, favors and dancing in the lobby. She will also perform at 11 P.M. in the Gallery on the second floor; the cost is $175 a person and includes dinner, favors and dancing. S. H. 2 Packages of Laughs    Caroline's Comedy Club, 1626 Broadway, between 49th and 50th Streets, (212) 757-4100. New York City's sleekest and most comfortable comedy club is offering two different entertainment packages on New Year's Eve. An 8 P.M. dinner package includes a comedy show with five performers: Susie Essman, Dave Attell, Jim David, George Gallo and John Henson. The price, which includes dinner, beer or wine and the show, is $55 a person. For the 10:30 P.M. countdown celebration, the performers are Walli Collins, Nick DiPollo, Ms. Essman, Mr. Gallo and Mr. Henson. The price is $110 a person and includes a choice of party platters, party favors, the show and admission to a post-show dance party. S.

After all, here was Thomas Hampson as Figaro, a role he has made something of a trademark. \"Largo al factotum\" was exuberant, handsome and precise; it seemed a sonic celebration of ego, perfect for an aria of self-praise. Ruth Ann Swenson was almost a model Rosina: while she may have tired during the final scenes (her voice was not firmly projecting in the lower range), elsewhere she had an almost delicious innocence and musicianship, always leaping for the high-pitched cadence, making the florid figuration an expression of her character's playful intelligence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931224","headline":"Review/Photography; Observers of America in an Unlikely Pairing","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/24/arts/review-photography-observers-of-america-in-an-unlikely-pairing.html","abstract":"  The most intriguing aspect of \"Walker Evans and Dan Graham,\" the provocative if disappointing show now at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is that it brings together the work of two artists whose names have probably seldom been mentioned in the same breath.

Hours are included for trees inside museums or office buildings. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Metropolitan Museum    Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; closed Mondays, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Open Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve: 9:30 A.M. to 4:45 P.M.    MONIKER: The Medieval Tree.   GETTING THERE: It's inside the museum, so you have to pay the suggested donation ($6; $3 for the elderly and students).   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: Situated in the Medieval Hall, that solemn, cavernous first-floor gallery with high ceilings, pillars and an enormous metal gate dividing the room. Wan light trickles in from some faraway, high-up source. Strange, severe artifacts gaze down from walls and pedestals: pale, delicate tapestries of forest scenes, rounded counte nances of the Virgin Mary, statuettes of bearded and red-coated fellows with fixed, accusing stares. This hushed, darkened sanctuary has the effect of making people behave as if they were walking through some ancient church or monastery: voices drop to low tones; laughter evaporates; expressions reflect the imposed reverence.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Tall and skinny, stretching up toward that distant source of light.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: As you enter the Medieval Hall, the tree unfolds like some proud, elaborate artwork unto itself.   DECORATIONS: This really is a rather highfalutin specimen: it has its own explanatory text posted nearby. To be precise, we're dealing with a Baroque Neapolitan Christmas Creche, produced in Naples in the second half of the 18th century. Dozens of figurines are spread around the base of the tree: shepherds with sheep, kings mounted upon elephants and camels, slaves carrying bundles of wood, oxen poking their heads out from behind lower branches, deer, goats, donkeys, rearing horses. Bodies are made of wrapped twine and wire, and the attire is original 18th-century costumes: the rich guys have great big, pillowy hats and children carrying their garment trains, while the poor folks are suitably dressed in rags. The heads and shoulders were made by Neapolitan sculptors, and there are even architectural backgrounds nestled among the branches: tile-roofed houses, vine-draped walls, a Baroque fountain, the remains of a Roman temple. Scattered on the ground is that mossy green stuff, like the kind you see in model train sets.   The branches are decorated with angels in different-colored robes, holding little electric candles and incense. Cherubs are poised in flight. They seem to be literally bursting out of the interior of the tree.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: The manger is set up on the temple steps at the front of the tree. According to the text, this is meant to represent the triumph of Christianity over ancient religions. So this tree comes with a moral.   STAR: Gold-and-silver tinselly starburst.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: With utter fealty and deference. Patrons of the Met come to pay homage to this tree. Middle-aged intellectual types with spectacles down on their noses give private dissertations among their friends. \"We come every year,\" effused one fatherly type. \"This is our favorite thing.\" \"It's beautiful,\" breathed another. A gray-haired woman in a plaid dress said to her companions: \"I'm sure there's a postcard in the store. If we can't get one today, I'll send one to you.\" Even the children seemed impressed: they scampered around, oohing and ahhing at the different animals.   SOUNDTRACK: Gregorian chants and medieval carols echo through the air.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Now that you've paid admission, why not enjoy the rest of the museum? Take in a couple of Rembrandts and Rubenses. Admire the installation of the antique French storefront. Marvel at van Gogh, the punk rocker of art history. And if you need a real respite from all this decorum, find yourself a couple of Winslow Homers, which will knock you out with their simplicity and emotional directness.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: A very big deal. New York Public Library    Fifth Avenue at 42d Street; (212) 869-8089. Holiday hours: Sunday, noon to 5 P.M.; Monday and Thursday, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Tuesday and Wednesday, 11 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Closed Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.   MONIKER: No special name, although a scientist studying this sort of thing might dub it the Ornithological Tree.   GETTING THERE: One must endure the crush of the Grand Central area, but the library itself is done up with great festivity. Even the lions wear wreaths around their necks, embellished with bows and lights.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: The tree is installed in the vestibule, opposite the front doors and between the stairwells. It's a pretty addition to the noble, neo-classical design of the room, with its vaulted ceiling, white marble archways and pillars. The interior features more holiday touches: pine garlands, big red bows, menorahs.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Kind of prickly and pointy, rising up a good portion of the two-story hallway.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: It's quite nice to sit on the marble stairs and watch the people come and go around the tree.   DECORATIONS: This tree is so generously decorated you can hardly see any green. Hundreds of electric candles poke out from the tips of branches, giving the tree a vaguely pagodalike look. There's a dusting of fake snow on the needles, plus the glitter of tiny white lights. The real attraction are the ornamental birds in a variety of poses and sizes: bluebirds with spread wings, cardinals with cocked heads, giant yellow-eyed owls with speckled feathers, screeching blue jays. Some birds are nesting; others seem poised for flight. There are brown birds and white birds, pink birds and yellow birds. More birds grace the pine rope garlands, which keep spectators at bay. Fake snow is sprinkled on the ground; birds hop through it. Birds, birds, birds! You could go a little bird-crazy looking at all of them.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: I tried to get a little more information from a kindly-faced woman at the information desk. With her gray hair pulled tight in a bun, ivory skin and Christmasy red sweater, she seemed pleasingly evocative of the Mrs. Claus type. Are the ornaments old? I asked her, and she looked a bit confused. \"No, no,\" she answered. \"This is the same tree we have every year. I haven't been informed that it's anything unusual. A few years ago, three, four years ago, we had a very special tree, a Japanese tree that was all made out of paper.\" Origami? \"Yes, yes. All handmade. It was very beautiful. But this is just your simple, ordinary tree.\"   STAR: No star on top. Nothing.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: Most stop for a moment on their way into the library. A few parents bring their children in especially to see the tree. Elderly women with scarves on their heads and several shopping bags in their hands stand and gaze admiringly.   SOUNDTRACK: The scuffle of feet, the hum of busy voices, the muffled roar of Fifth Avenue traffic.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Millions of books, magazines and periodicals, as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibition.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: Functionally sound. This tree may not warrant a special trip (unless you're an ornithologist), but for those passing through the library it's a welcome reminder of the season.  Lincoln Center    Broadway at 65th Street. Lights go off at 1 A.M      MONIKER: You might call it the Symphony Tree.   GETTING THERE: Easy, except at peak performance hours.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: Situated in the Fountain Plaza. And really, woefully little has been done to dress the place up otherwise. A couple of small potted trees with white lights stand around, but other than that, the tree rises up stark and lonesome from its concrete bed, uncomfortably evoking those suburban housing developments where each tract of land has been flattened and cleared of vegetation except for a single transplanted tree. It somehow looks lost and unnatural, all alone there in that big empty plaza. Unadorned steel barriers surround it, adding to the alienation factor. Cables anchored to the ground hold it in place.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Smooth, trim. A great big triangle.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: From a distance -- hurtling down Broadway in a speeding cab, for instance -- it's nice to look up and see the tree flash past. But up close, it's a little disappointing.   DECORATIONS: Covered from tip to foot with bright-colored lights: red, blue, purple, gold, green. Interspersed among them are weird shapes in white lights that are meant to be the outlines of musical instruments and related motifs. However, the shapes are so nebulous that it kind of defeats the purpose. A little girl was walking by, holding her father's hand. \"Guitars!\" she screamed. Well, no, actually, they're violins. \"Saxophones!\" she shrieked. Wrong again, that's not a saxophone, it's a -- what? Bassoon? Wait -- it's a trombone! Yes! And an anatomically incorrect trombone at that. It's missing a mouthpiece, so it looks rather like a giant white paper clip that flares at one end.   A friend and I were intently studying a couple of big white blobs in the northeastern region of the tree. We crept up to the metal barriers. We were the only people there. \"Oh, I get it,\" said my friend, after several moments' pause. \"Look, you can see the pale outlines of the shapes underneath the lights. Those aren't blobs. They're drama masks.\" Lo and behold, he was right: we could faintly make out these tracer patterns with the faces of comedy and tragedy. Then there were these thin, somewhat vertical blobs. My friend said they were conductors with raised arms about to bring down their batons. To this day I do not quite believe him.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: On the far side of the tree there is in fact a guitar, but it's much smaller than the violin. So does that mean the violin is actually a viola? How about a cello? Oh, my, how confusing.   STAR: A white snowflake light on top.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: A couple walked up with their arms around each other. Although it was only about 5:30 on a weekday afternoon, few people racing through the plaza were stopping to look at the tree, which made its metal barriers seem all the more pointless. \"Wow,\" said the man. Strangely, he was looking not at the tree but at a point in the night sky. \"Wow, it's a beautiful moon tonight,\" he said.   SOUNDTRACK: All the music is sequestered inside the buildings.    NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: All of Lincoln Center. All of Columbus Circle. Record stores, movie theaters, clothing stores, anything! Just keep moving.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: This symphony might need a little bit more work. Japan Airlines    655 Fifth Avenue, at 52d Street. Spotlights on 24 hours a day.   MONIKER: The Origami Tree.   GETTING THERE: Ack! Midtown Manhattan on Christmas Eve! Tourists from all lands stampeding between Rockefeller Center, Bergdorf Goodman and F. A. O. Schwarz! This is no New Yorker's idea of a smart place to be. But believe me now: it's worth it.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: The tree is just inside the Japan Airlines office, but the enormous picture windows allow an excellent view. For peak festivity and communal experience, stand out front and press your nose against the glass.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Exactly 12 feet 7 inches. The shape is a perfect cone: no branches sticking out, no spindly parts on top, no sagging or irregular branches. As perfect as geometry. Every available square millimeter of surface space is covered with origami ornaments of incalculable variety. And get this: the tree turns. That's right, it spins on some unseen, highly technological axis.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: From a distance, it's impossible to discern the details of the literally thousands of origami ornaments; the tree looks like one giant crumple of paper. Even from up close, the details are still nigh impossible to sort out, but certainly the closer the better.   DECORATIONS: As you stand outside watching the tree turn, a few of the bigger, more obvious ornaments begin to stand out. Like the gorilla holding an old-fashioned, Y-in-the-middle subway token. Or the Statue of Liberty, surrounded by a circle of little stars. There are green origami cactuses and silver dive-bombing airplanes. Red lobsters and pale blue sailboats. Dinosaurs, a rhinoceros and flying dragons. As you look at it a little longer, strange, cryptic shapes begin to pop up. Handbags. Cameras. Shoes. Plus lots and lots of red hearts, all made from paper.   As I was standing on 52d Street, trying to get a handle on all this, I heard a polite voice over my shoulder. \"Can I help you?\" said the voice. There was an older fellow in a bright red, hooded jacket and a tweedy snap-brim cap, looking at me out of a pair of sky-blue eyes. \"Do you have any questions about my tree?\" said the fellow. He craned his neck and peered at my notebook. \"What are you writing?\"    \"Your tree?\" I said. \"Did you make all the ornaments?\"   \"I made 90 percent of them: I made all except the ones that are by the person who originally designed them,\" he said. He was off and running, just from that one question. \"My name is Michael Shall,\" he continued. \"This is my tree. I designed it and put the ornaments up. Every day I go in there and clean and care for it and clean off the pretzel crumbs. That's because people point and say, 'Look at that one!' \" He flung his arm out to demonstrate tourists pointing with pretzels in their hands. \"I just got back from Holland, where I did a 46-foot origami tree,\" he offered. \"It was trimmed by mountain climbers hanging down on ropes.\"   He smiled in the warmest, most persuasive way. \"I'm an origami specialist,\" he said. \"I want the whole world to fold paper.\"   Mr. Shall went on to dispense an incredible wealth of information, not just about his tree but about himself. He said he had been in his unusual profession for 17 years and that he had decorated some 99 trees. He is the origami specialist for the American Museum of Natural History, and he designs its origami tree, too, but he doesn't personally trim it. The Japan Airlines tree gets a fanatical amount of care. Sure, at first it appears to be a random assortment of designs. But Mr. Shall has constructed his tree with the meticulous precision of a Shakespearean sonnet. Every ornament means something to him and is juxtaposed with ornaments with related meanings.   \"Look, you see right there, where it says 'I Love A.M.N.H.'?\" he said. \"That's because I love the Museum of Natural History. And you see the figure placed just below it? That's the president of the museum waving her arm, saying, 'Come to my museum!'   \"You see that cat down there?\" he said, pointing to an ornament near the bottom on the tree. \"That cat has a clipped tail. That's because it's my cat, and he lost his tail during the trimming of the tree. He had a tumor and had to have it removed. I had to come in and fold the tail down. Would you like a peppermint?\" He offered me a Life Saver.   \"You see that one there? That's King Kong holding a subway token. You see over there? That's a pair of pears. Right down there, I have the inside of my house. I have an ornament for everyone in my building. Edna, she's my landlady. That shoe over there, that's for a woman in my building who likes to wear incredibly high heels.\"   He said there were more than 5,000 pieces of origami altogether on and around the tree, and that the trimming took him 240 hours.    He pointed out a clown in the upper reaches of the tree. \"You see that one?\" he said. \"That's me.\"   OF SPECIAL NOTE: The origami creche at the base of the tree. \"Someone from a newspaper came to take a picture, and they said: 'Where's Jesus? There's no Jesus in the manger,' \" Mr. Shall recalled. \"I said: 'Of course not. That's because it's not Christmas yet.' \" Mr. Shall leaned forward and divulged a bit of secret information. \"He's asleep under the manger,\" he admitted. \"I keep him there because one year I lost the baby Jesus. I was up all night on Christmas Eve frantically folding a new one.\"   STAR: A brightly, sparkling gold star. A side note: the tree is officially called \"Paper Magic: The Origami Holiday Tree.\" Mr. Shall's designs are not creed-specific.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: Look, I can't vouch for everyone, but I was completely enthralled.    SOUNDTRACK: Find Mr. Shall and allow him to supply the running commentary.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Pale by comparison.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: If the heart of the season is the giving of joy, Mr. Shall and his tree bestow more than their share. City Hall    Broadway and Park Row. For information and hours: (212) 788-4636.   MONIKER: The Low-Budget, New-York-Is-Still-in-a-Slump Tree   GETTING THERE: You just need to weave between all the town cars with tinted windows parked in front of City Hall.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: In the middle of the park in front of City Hall. The park is low-key, but clean and relatively serene: just quiet trees, shrubs, a few paved paths and benches. City Hall is decorated with red, white and blue banners, which aren't exactly holiday-specific but add to the festive feeling.   SIZE AND SHAPE: A tiny bit lopsided -- vaguely S-shaped, even.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: From inside the park, or from Park Row.   DECORATIONS: Fiscally conservative -- just colored lights in long vertical strings. It's simple but effective, especially for an outdoor tree. The City Hall Tree is a kind of junior sibling to the Rockefeller Center tree: same principle, but lacking the grand scale.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: A sign is posted in the park: \"Holiday Tree and Lighting Courtesy of Country Living.\" So the city didn't even pay for it.   STAR: A pretty, white-lit five-point star.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: A couple of folks were sitting on the park benches, happily gazing. And the workers coming to and from City Hall would give it a happy glance. The pigeons, however, paid it no special attention.   SOUNDTRACK:The park seemed peaceful and quiet in the gray afternoon winter light.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: The gorgeous, turn-of-the-century brownstone and brick buildings across the street once housed New York's Newspaper Row.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: The area has a subdued, old-town charm, although it feels more somber and reflective than celebratory. Rockefeller Center    Off Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. Lighted 24 hours a day.   MONIKER: THE TREE -- capital THE, capital TREE. The big daddy, the big kahuna, only, the king of them all.   GETTING THERE: See Japan Airlines tree.   GENERAL ENVIRONMENT: At this time of year, Rockefeller Center is probably the most international spot in the city. As you bustle through the promenade toward the skating rink, you are likely to hear all manner of foreign languages. Even the stores around here have a multicultural aura: Librairie de France, Teuscher Chocolatier, Crabtree & Evelyn, etc. And if all this is starting to feel like a Benetton ad for world peace, then just put a lid on your cynicism, because at the end of the promenade, on the other side of the skating rink, with the vast sky-scraping facade of 30 Rockefeller Center serving as its backdrop, is the most beautiful, heart-stopping, majestic and awesome tree of all time, transcending commercialism and crowds and all the hype that comes with the holidays.   SIZE AND SHAPE: Its mammoth branches droop provocatively, all shaggy and forest-green, as if laden with imaginary snow; it towers so tall and mighty that nearly all of New York City fits beneath it.   BEST VANTAGE POINT: Anywhere in the promenade, from the street all the way to the rink. When you turn that corner and see it for the first time, it takes your breath away.   DECORATIONS: What ornaments could deck it? Just colored lights shivering and twinkling among the branches.   OF SPECIAL NOTE: Do not underestimate the tree's power of romance. Bring your significant other.   STAR: Again, simple yet utterly tasteful: just a white, bright, five-point star. That's all you need.   HOW PEOPLE REACT: Uniform delight. All who walk the promenade raise their eyes toward it; to all faces, it brings that spontaneous, un-self-conscious smile. Teen-agers are giggling and chatting; maintenance workers will wink at you. Middle-aged men smile at young girls, and it doesn't feel creepy. Elderly women in hats and gloves momentarily forget their age. Strangers talk to one another without fear or hesitation. I'm telling you, it's magic.   SOUNDTRACK: Christmas carols from the skating rink; jingle bells from the sidewalk barkers, soliciting money for the homeless or the Salvation Army.   NEARBY ATTRACTIONS: Go ahead, go ice skating. It's one of those touristy New York experiences that all New Yorkers should try at some point in their lives.   OVERALL BESTOWAL OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT: Incomparable. For just a moment, the tree can make the world melt away, can dissolve the hubbub and hectic stress of the holiday season. For just a moment, it can bring a silent and somehow holy breath of peace into your heart.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931224","headline":"Poorhouses, Pamphlets and Marley's Ghost","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/24/opinion/poorhouses-pamphlets-and-marleys-ghost.html","abstract":"One dark afternoon in January, I sat at a round table in the library on East 36th Street in New York City from which J.

But Ezekiel Solomons, a Jewish fur trader, was canoeing west along the St. Lawrence River and into the Great Lakes territories still dominated by French traders and their Indian allies. Twice captured and nearly put to death by Indians, several times bankrupted, Solomons and three cousins pushed their fur-trading network into the wilderness well beyond Lake Superior, bartering blankets, trinkets, dry goods and liquor for hundreds of pelts.   In 1771, a decade later and several hundred miles to the east, Elizabeth Judah was stitching a sampler of the Ten Commandments. It is one of the oldest items in the Jewish Museum's current exhibition on Jewish life in Canada. Some of the cloth has disintegrated, but many of the lines remain almost as bright and as legible as when the 8-year-old girl cross-stitched them 222 years ago in the small town of Three Rivers, Quebec:\"Take not the name of god in vain/ Nor dare the Sabbath day profane.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931224","headline":"Reputation for Innovation Precedes H.R.A.

Some writers consider the practice a crime and torture, and reproach Africans for not taking action to stop it. Another calls it a joyous occasion for the girls who undergo the operation.   The motives behind this mobilization could be genuine human concern about the \"poor Africans.\" But at the same time those who are dealing with the problem and who are familiar with the situation cannot help asking whether or not the writers have cared to inform themselves about the efforts that Africans are making to deal with the problem.   Those who are genuinely concerned about the hazardous consequences of female genital mutilation will be glad to learn that African women and men have organized themselves under the umbrella of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, and they are campaigning in their own way to eradicate the custom.   This committee was set up in 1984, following the will of the African participants in a seminar on traditional practices held in Dakar, Senegal.   Since then, 24 national affiliates, or committees, have been established.

But this year there was indeed more: Julianne Baird, a soprano who brings special eloquence and expressivity to early music, took part in the little hourlong program, which was given twice on Tuesday evening.   A half-dozen carols were beautifully done at the second performance. In the \"Sussex Carol,\" a listener hardly knew what to admire more: Ms. Baird's solo opening or her superbly matched duet with Marc Schachman, the oboist. In \"When Christ Was Born on Earth,\" Ms. Baird joined the players on equal terms, sweetly humming along with Mr. Schachman, Myron Lutzke, the cellist, and Arthur Haas, the harpsichordist. \"Es ist ein Ros' entsprungen\" was haunting, and Ms. Baird delivered \"Greensleeves\" with such hearty conviction that a listener could only share her optimistic wish for the new year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931225","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/25/nyregion/inside-373093.html","abstract":"  Old Enemies, New Partners    Indian tribes with casinos are seeking to protect their profits by sharing information about corrupt managers and gamblers who cheat.

What had been eight men working became a unit willing to turn the communal experience into something transcendental, to use physical movement and music's sensuality as a release from the mundane.   The song, \"The Peanut Vendor,\" ended up being an Afro-Cuban suite. It started out smoothly, with Hiram Remon singing almost introspectively. Figures and rhythmic riffs were added. The performance changed mood, picking up the gravity of a great groove, and as it hit the improvisation section, the band blossomed. Lewis Kahn on violin improvised first, then turned the last few notes of his solo into a riff that was picked up by the rest of the band; the saxophonist Gene Jefferson improvised next. Mr. Kahn shifted the riff around, and the band picked that up as well.
