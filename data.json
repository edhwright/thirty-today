The International Atomic Energy Agency is right to insist on the inspections and Pyongyang would be wise to invite the inspectors. By dispelling doubts about its nuclear intentions, the North can open the way to wider political and economic ties.   The inspections are needed to clear up discrepancies between what Pyongyang told the I.A.E.A. about its production of plutonium and what the agency discovered in its recent inspections. By searching through the North's nuclear plants and waste, inspectors can determine how long its research reactors have been running and how much plutonium they could have produced. That would help determine whether the discrepancy is a minor one or whether the North has produced enough nuclear material for bomb-making.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930206","headline":"Big Cannons Turning on the Franc","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/06/your-money/IHT-big-cannons-turning-on-the-franc.html","abstract":"THE consensus among foreign exchange analysts is that Thursday's tiny downward move in German interest rates has sent a signal to the markets.

Some of those goals can be achieved by using dried cherries, an ingredient that is a fairly recent addition to the pantry.   Dried cherries are plumper than the typical raisins sold in boxes. While not quite as sweet as raisins, they do add both a note of color and a tart sweetness when substituted for raisins in a dish. They can be used in savory recipes, with poultry, game meats and even fish like salmon. A dried-cherry relish or vinegar-based chutney is excellent to accompany a pate or, for a luxurious Valentine dinner, some foie gras served cold or freshly sauteed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Armani Disarmed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/style/armani-disarmed.html","abstract":"  WHO is Gio?

The ambitious Basquiat quickly left the streets, where he gained his first celebrity as a graffiti artist, for the studio, where he painted on a grand scale, both physically and emotionally. His brilliantly colored canvases were covered with anguished figures and sardonic printed phrases like \"Haloes fifty nine cent\" or \"Milk$;.\" In JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT (Whitney Museum of American Art/Abrams, $65), Richard Marshall, a curator at the Whitney Museum, analyzes Basquiat's iconography as the fruit of a voracious visual curiosity that took in everything from ancient Rhodesian rock art to product symbols. This handsome catalogue for a retrospective exhibit of Basquiat's work, which is at the Whitney through Feb. 14, contains essays by five critics, including Greg Tate of The Village Voice, who compares Basquiat to other black artists who combine words with images. The Yale art historian Robert Farris Thompson explores how Basquiat transformed \"music into paint\" in such densely detailed canvases as \"Zydeco.\" Basquiat's nervous calligraphy and flayed-looking figures, often depicted in attitudes of helpless exposure, contrast with his rich surfaces, as in \"Leonardo da Vinci's Greatest Hits.\" The artist's recognition of the depths of human dishonesty wrapped his works in an angry gloom, but his paintings' unflagging vitality stands in counterpoint, and marks Jean-Michel Basquiat as a quintessentially American painter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Arcade Owner And the Community","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/nyregion/l-arcade-owner-and-the-community-775093.html","abstract":"  After reading \"A Rare Oasis of Enjoyment Suffers a Moment of Doubt\"  [ Jan. 17 ]  about the decline in business at Space Plex, the amusement arcade in Nesconset following the alleged Katie Beers disappearance, I felt compelled to write.

When it moved from U.S. 1 in 1990 to a handsomely converted trolley barn in Norwalk, it changed its old-fashioned atmosphere to that of a simple, stylish Spanish country inn -- and the restaurant moved from Good to Very Good in this reviewer's opinion. Several dinners over a period of time and intensive visits in recent weeks lead one to move the rating once again -- to Excellent.    The Meson Galicia kitchen has shown a steady high consistency -- which is no easy feat -- a willingness to introduce new dishes and to tinker with old ones that didn't quite work. Though not on the winter menu, paella valenciana is the most obvious example. Formerly a somewhat mushy version of the Valencian classic, it now has the requisite chewy, almost nutty edge. A new interest in the Spanish version of nouvelle cuisine affects the beautiful plate presentations, though not the ample portions. Furthermore, the use of fresh, high quality ingredients shines through in each dish.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Melinda Duryea, Alexander Draper","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/style/engagements-melinda-duryea-alexander-draper.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. James M.

Seven years after routing the annual spring onslaught of students by, among other things, stopping advertising in university newspapers and prohibiting sleeping on the beach, Fort Lauderdale has been reinvented as a sophisticated community with year-round vitality. The Fort Lauderdale of the 1990's has more in common with the Riviera of Hitchcock's \"To Catch a Thief\" than with that defining beach classic (shot at Fort Lauderdale Beach), \"Where the Boys Are.\" \n\nThe beach renovation is a striking, six-year, $26 million project, that, in essence, moved automobiles away from the beach in favor of landscaping and pedestrian access. Meanwhile, downtown, away from the beach and busy, parallel highway A1A, a sophisticated and vital hub flourishes with sidewalk cafes, elegant boutiques, a riverfront park and ambitious new museums and performing arts facilities. Whole derelict neighborhoods that withered in the 1970's and 80's with the expansion west, toward the Everglades, of residential tracts and massive shopping malls, are being reclaimed. A new international airport brings visitors from Germany and Scandinavia, Britain and Canada. \nEvents\n\n The two-year-old Broward Center for the Performing Arts has become a magnet for visiting theatrical presentations and performers of the first rank. Tomorrow, devotees of classical music will be treated to a concert by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. On March 4 and 5, principal dancers of the New York City Ballet will present a tribute to George Balanchine and, on March 22, the Montreal Symphony comes to town. Also on the schedule are touring companies of Broadway hits, like \"The Secret Garden,\" March 9 to 21, and \"Cats,\" April 20 to 25. For jazz and pop aficionados, highlights include the Chieftains, March 3, and the New River Jazz Festival April 2 to 4. Tickets range from $10 to $55.

Last year our reviewer, Tom Wicker, praised Mr. Hacker's \"calm, analytical eye, his unblinking view of American history and his unwillingness to accept cant and 'common sense' as facts. Equally important is his compassion for the plight and sensibilities of those from whom white Americans ask 'an extra patience and perseverance' that the same whites 'have never required of themselves.' \"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/travel/c-corrections-785693.html","abstract":"  An air fare listing in the Travel Watch column on Jan. 24 included an outdated entry under the heading \"Discount Fare.\" The $228 round-trip fare offered by United Airlines between New York and Miami expired on Jan. 21.

The works of 20th-century Latin American artists are featured, along with Hispanic-inspired works by non-Hispanic artists.   The show is based on a quincentennial \"Spanish Steps\" program introduced into the school's curriculum in 1991, focusing on the historic and cultural ties between the United States, Latin America and Spain.   Jean Charlot, now dead, whose work is on view, was born in France in 1898 but moved to Mexico in the 1920's and was a founder of the Mexican Mural Renaissance. He collaborated with Diego Rivera on mural projects in the 30's, and he painted portraits of many of his artist friends, including David Siqueiros and Jose Orozco.   Antonio Frasconi came to New York City from Uruguay in the 1940's on a scholarship to the Art Students League. His work as a printmaker and illustrator is known worldwide. He is now distinguished teaching professor of art at the State University of New York at Purchase.   Gabriela de la Vega, a native of Mexico, studied in Manhattan, Paris and Los Angeles and has an established reputation as a watercolorist and illustrator. Antonio Martorelli was born in Puerto Rico and studied in Madrid. He is a performance artist, writer and teacher as well as an illustrator and set designer.   Constance Del Vecchio Maltese is a native New Yorker and a member of the Society of Illustrators. She is best known for her portrait series of the great explorers, including Columbus, Magellan, Marco Polo and others, on view at the U.S.S. Intrepid Sea-Air Space Museum.   Alton Tobey, an American whose work is in the collections of major museums in the United States and Europe, contributed his portraits of several notable Mexican individuals painted during his 35 trips there.   More than 100 works of art in various media can be seen through Feb. 21. The school is at 100 Overlook Circle; visiting hours are tomorrow through Friday of this week from 3 to 6 P.M., and Saturday through Feb. 21 from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. For more information, call 632-8836. CONCERTS FOR SINGLES    \"Musique d'Amour,\" one of the Symphony Singles concerts by the New Orchestra of Westchester, designed as get-togethers for music lovers who have no spouses or significant others, will be held today at 3 P.M. in the West Room at Reid Castle of Manhattanville College in Purchase. The concert features Chris Calloway, daughter of Cab Calloway, in a program of songs by George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein and Irving Berlin. Ms. Calloway will be accompanied on the piano by Kevin O'Connell.   A reception and refreshments will follow the program. Tickets are $25 at the door. ARROWWOOD VALENTINE    A bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates will welcome Valentine getaway weekenders at the Doral Arrowwood in Rye Brook. Special rates of $129 a room for each night are offered on Friday and Sunday, $139 on Saturday. Buffet breakfasts are included.   Some special programs begin with a cocktail reception Friday evening. A Saturday-morning aerobic workout will be followed by a workshop on techniques for body massages, and a cooking workshop is scheduled for Saturday afternoon with Paul McCarthy, the executive chef. He will demonstrate how to prepare heart-shaped dishes for two. Admission of $20 for one or two people includes take-home recipes and aprons.   Saturday evening's candlelight dinner will cost $28 a person and include dancing to a jazz ensemble, roses for the women, and a complimentary glass of champagne. A four-course Italian menu, with wines selected for each course, will be served on Sunday night for $50 a person. The number to call for more information or reservations is 939-5500. FAMILY ART WORKSHOPS    Every Sunday from noon to 2:30 P.M., beginning today through May 23, two-hour family art workshops will be in progress at the Caramoor Center in Katonah.   The program, which takes advantage of the educational opportunities inherent in the architecture, furnishings, decorative and fine arts of Caramoor's House Museum, its outbuildings and landscaped grounds, was devised by Evelyn Albert, the new director of education and former museum educator at the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan.   Today's subject is stick puppets of the Renaissance, which the children and adults will make after touring the Music Room -- filled with Renaissance treasures -- and listening to music of the period.   Next Sunday's project is the making of a commedia dell'arte mask for Valentine's Day, based on an orientation tour of the museum. Workshops on such subjects as animals in architectural and decorative detail, door knockers, elaborate hats, and book-making are to be offered in future sessions.   The series is suitable for children from 4 through 11, accompanied by a parent or other adult. The fee for each workshop of $6 for adults and $4 for children includes materials. For reservations or more information, the number to call is 232-5035.

Visitors seem most drawn to the shops that sell furnishings, antiques to postmodern.    The street stretches six miles from downtown New Orleans and the gentrified Warehouse District past the Garden District, the Irish Channel, and upscale, uptown New Orleans. The shops are clustered in clumps of two or three blocks interspersed with residences, restaurants, coffee shops, supermarkets and drugstores. The pattern is rather like a string of European villages -- appealing to shoppers who feel they've been malled to death. The diversions include the street's architecture, fried oysters at Casamento's, 4330 Magazine, (504) 895-9761, an immaculately tiled cafe where lunch with a beer can be bought for under $10, and Joey K's Restaurant and Bar, 3001 Magazine, (504) 891-0997.

Over 17 years of near obscurity, Mr. Lopez has built the prototype of the modern inner-city political machine, one capable of generating thousands of votes and armies of volunteers, largely by exploiting its links to a social-service organization that Mr. Lopez founded and that is now the largest employer and economic enterprise in his neighborhood.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"KILLINGS BY TROOPS UP IN ISRAELI ZONES","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/world/killings-by-troops-up-in-israeli-zones.html","abstract":"  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's first half-year in office has seen a surge in killings of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories, raising questions about the army's use of gunfire to break up riots and to arrest suspects there.

Classical-music fans who may have missed this bit of folk wisdom are discovering it for themselves, now that one of the luxuries of the radio landscape -- weekly national concert broadcasts of the best American orchestras -- is fast disappearing. In the last five years, corporations pinched by the recession have been withdrawing sponsorship for these series, which cost up to $1 million a year to produce. And many classical-radio programmers have come to see the concerts as a nuisance rather than a boon.   These broadcasts are important for many reasons. They offer newcomers to classical music large samplings of repertory in unvarnished performances and a concert context. They allow more devoted listeners to track the progress and programming of orchestras around the country, and with concert tickets selling for as much as $55, they give radio eavesdroppers something for nothing. They introduce new conductors and soloists. And they include new works, giving listeners quick access to pieces likely to cause a stir and granting a moment in the sun to scores that may never be commercially recorded.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"IN THE NATURAL STATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/nyregion/in-the-natural-state.html","abstract":"UPON reflection, it seems that every several columns or so, I have reason to refer to a common New Jersey grass with an uncommon-sounding name.

Le Corbusier haunts not only the forms of Canal Plus but also its site, formerly the location of Citroen's car factories.

And though their interpretations were different, they had a shared purpose: they treated the blues as art music, as opposed to popular music.   The two composers approached the music in a new way, one not identified with the European classical world of Mozart or Beethoven, though undeniably classical. Their conception was based on a classical model whose elements are simplicity, durability, cultural importance and critical consensus. Blues, not the genre but the form, looks as if it's going to outlast many of the cultural products of the 20th century.

He was armed with youth, idealism -- and a camera. From the moment he met James Forman, the executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- who promptly put him to work photographing the segregated drinking fountains in an Albany, Ga., courthouse -- Mr. Lyon became S.N.C.C.'s first staff photographer, the visual historian of the movement. In the remarkable MEMORIES OF THE SOUTHERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT (University of North Carolina, cloth, $39.95; paper, $19.95) are images of armed police officers and tear-gassed demonstrators, a hooded Klansman, and S.N.C.C. organizers like Robert Moses, John Lewis and Marion Barry, the future Mayor of Washington. There is also a photograph of shattered stained-glass windows, hanging loose like broken limbs, in the Birmingham, Ala., church where a 1963 bombing killed four adolescent girls.

For years villagers plowing this fertile spot overlooking the Menderes River Valley in southwestern Turkey had been turning up rubble from an earlier civilization and putting it to modern uses. Elaborately carved marble sarcophagi served as handsome watering troughs for sheep and as vats for pressing grapes into homemade wine.    Modern inhabitants, who rode their donkeys beside the majestic columns that were still standing, passed along a legacy of the ancient city of Aphrodisias. According to legend, the Greeks and Romans built this ornate marble metropolis to honor Aphrodite, the goddess of love, life and fertility. But it took more than 30 years of excavations to provide a portrait of the extensive cultural center, complete with a stadium that could hold 30,000 spectators, centrally heated Roman baths and workshops where sculptors elevated marble-carving to a high art.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930207","headline":"Keeping Would-Be Doctors' Dreams Alive","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/07/nyregion/keeping-would-be-doctors-dreams-alive.html","abstract":"  EVERY Saturday, Galia Lyn, a 17-year-old junior at Mount Vernon High School, forgoes part of her weekend in favor of a sixth full day of school.

The world premiere of his Fourth Symphony, a work commissioned by the orchestra, received a warm and enthusiastic reception. And at the conclusion of the concert, there was a prolonged standing ovation.   The acclaim was deserved. Over the course of a long career, Mr. Lutoslawski has established himself as a leading composer of the post-World War II generation, one of a group of Eastern European and Soviet composers (including Gyorgy Ligeti, Gyorgy Kurtag and Alfred Schnittke), whose work has been highly original and idiosyncratic, despite the pressures of Communist regimes. Composers like Shostakovich wrote music that could brilliantly undercut official taste while seeming to satisfy it, but Mr. Lutoslawski, whose First Symphony was banned by Stalinist censors in 1949, led a double compositional life. For many years, he earned money writing radio and film music for the Government while devising his own atonal language and style in solitude.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930208","headline":"Good Enough to Fight, But Not for Citizenship","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/08/nyregion/good-enough-to-fight-but-not-for-citizenship.html","abstract":"  Although his eyes have grown dimmer, the slight, white-haired Filipino veteran vividly remembers taking an oath of allegiance to the United States of America, half a century ago in the mountains of Sara on Iloilo island in the Philippines.

A Federal district court in Cleveland began a hearing today on whether a permit for testing the incinerator should be rescinded.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930208","headline":"Next: Campaign Finance Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/08/opinion/next-campaign-finance-reform.html","abstract":"  An unmistakable fog of political incompetence is beginning to form around the White House. The Bush and Carter Presidencies showed the danger of letting small droplets of error condense into an enveloping miasma. History also points out a quick fix uniquely available to Presidents -- change the subject by re-emphasizing a core promise. In President Clinton's case, one such promise is political reform.    No one can undo the mistakes of the past two weeks -- all the more reason for Mr. Clinton to get on with pushing ethics and campaign finance legislation on the Hill. But he must have the support of the Democratic leadership, and the unpleasant truth is that House Speaker Thomas Foley is still backpedaling on his pledge of swift action to clean up campaign financing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930208","headline":"Essay; The Clinton Direction","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/08/opinion/essay-the-clinton-direction.html","abstract":"  Whither the infant Administration?
