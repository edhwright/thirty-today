Rarely has a pop song been better used as a musical accent on film, as Nilsson's sweet, soaring vocal conveys the fragile optimism of Joe Buck, the story's self-styled stud. The music buoyantly follows Joe to New York City as he dreams of his bright future as a gigolo. But as the film spirals downward, from high hopes to seedy realities and from Park Avenue to 42d Street, it delivers a stark cross section of Joe's brutalizing new world.   Slapped with an X rating when it opened in 1969, \"Midnight Cowboy\" was controversial in its day. That X was later scaled down to an R after the film won three Academy Awards, including the Oscar for best picture.

The installation, called \"Altervista,\" was created by four Brooklyn artists -- Elizabeth Ierulli, Laura Mc Callum, James Nelson and Nancy Steinson -- and includes a window of photographs (above, one by Dean Brown).   The exhibition, which opens on Saturday, is sponsored by the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, which will also sponsor a group show at the Red Hook piers in May and its annual outdoor sculpture show at Empire State Fulton Ferry Park in July.

MIDTOWN Commemorating World War II Battles   The Intrepid Sea, Air, Space Museum will open an exhibition called \"Air War Over Europe\" today, the 50th anniversary of the start of massive bombing raids on German factories by the United States Air Force and Britain's Royal Air Force.    The show includes archival photographs (above, a Thunderbird), air combat footage and more than 100 models of British and American aircraft. Also on view will be flight gear donated by Allied and Axis crews, including a woman's R.A.F. fatigue hat. \"Any kind of female uniform outfit is very rare,\" said Severino Mendez, the uniform curator of the show. \"No man collects it.\"   The show will run through January 1996, when the Intrepid concludes its commemoration of World War II.

Starting on radio in 1929 and continuing on television, Guy Lombardo and his orchestra ushered in the New Year from the Waldorf Astoria ballroom for generations of Americans, and the band lives on, despite the death of it's eponymous founder in 1977. Al Pierson (pictured above right, with Guy Lombardo) is today's leader, and he may be persuaded to play \"Auld Lang Syne.\"   The Pied Pipers sang with the Tommy Dorsey Band, and Gary Crosby is carrying on the crooning tradition established by his father, Bing.

With his friend the journalist Harry Henderson, Bearden began working on A HISTORY OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARTISTS: From 1792 to the Present (Pantheon, $65). The book, completed by Mr. Henderson after Bearden's death in 1988, is the first in-depth reference work on the history and development of art by black Americans. Beginning in 1792 with the portraitist Joshua Johnston and ending with the contemporary landscape painter Richard Mayhew, the authors concentrate on significant painters and sculptors in specific historical periods; they provide a wealth of detail on the lives and achievements of more than 50 artists. Excellent reproductions, both in color and in black and white, of famous, lesser-known and rediscovered works illustrate the diversity of interests and styles in black American art. A few of the artists included here, like Henry Ossawa Tanner, Robert S. Duncanson, William H. Johnson and Jacob Lawrence, have been the subjects of recent scholarly attention; Romare Bearden and Harry Henderson give powerful evidence that many other black artists are equally deserving of attention.

Since the fall of the wall, this former working-class district in the north of eastern Berlin has invariably been described as an island of trendiness in the persistently dreary, still Communist-looking East. Until recently, though, visitors from the West tended to be disappointed. Aside from choosing among a small number of restaurants, bars and live-music venues, many of which opened in the chaotic months of 1990, there was not a whole lot to do except walk around and marvel at the relative intactness of the buildings. (Compared with other parts of Berlin, the neighborhood sustained only moderate damage in World War II, and the Communists did not have enough money after the war to do much tearing down and rebuilding.)    In the past six months, however, the pace of change there has speeded up dramatically. Streets that seemed hopelessly deserted a year ago are now full of new businesses. The turn-of-the-century underground railway line that connected Prenzlauer Berg to western Berlin before the building of the wall was finally reconnected last November, making the rest of the city feel much closer. Dozens of new cafes, restaurants and bars -- or places calling themselves cafes but really combining features of all three -- are regularly attracting people from both halves of Berlin. The best of these places are strikingly designed and offer excellent food, yet somehow manage to maintain an intimate, accommodating atmosphere quite different from their more severe counterparts in western Berlin.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940220","headline":"The 49th State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/books/l-the-49th-state-213527.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Orlando Figes's review of \"The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians,\" by W.

Centuries of tradition, however, cannot keep a healthy folk music from changing. The griot's usual accompaniment consisted of little more than harplike instruments like the kora or gourd xylophones. During the 1960's and 70's, rock and rhythm-and-blues joined an invasion of Cuban pop throughout Africa, and the cities of Mali bristled with electric guitars and large amplified bands.   The wildest music has faded now, but a new generation of griots retains elements of the brash sound and sleek drive of Western pop. The neo-traditional sound of Mali is nowhere more potent than in the southern district of Wassoulou, for which the music is named. Its most penetrating, dramatic performer is a 26-year-old woman named Oumou Sangare. Unlike many regional styles in Africa, Wassoulou comes in a concise anthology, \"Women of Mali: The Wassoulou Sound,\" which includes all the major performers and not a single drab track.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940220","headline":"The View From: Bronxville;\nA Hospital Volunteer Who Is Repaying His Debt of Health","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/20/nyregion/the-view-from-bronxville-a-hospital-volunteer-who-is-repaying-his.html","abstract":"BOB BLUM has had a few narrow escapes.

LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 1643: Anthony Jansen van Salee, the first European settler, arrives from Holland in what is now known as Bensonhurst. 1652: Cornelius van Wekhoven, a functionary for the Dutch West India Company from Utrecht, Holland, acquired the land from a tribe of Indians. For the property, he traded six shirts, two pairs of shoes, six pairs of socks, six hatchets, six knives, two scissors and six combs. 1657: The property was divided into 21 50-acre plots and granted to 19 settlers. Two of the plots were reserved for the poor. The settlers named it New Utrecht. 1783: Rebellious Americans erected a liberty pole with a flag at what is now 83d Street and 18th Avenue. The Fifth replica of the pole still stands in that spot, a patch of green in front of the New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church. 1828: The New Utrecht Dutch Reformed Church was built at 83d Street and 18th Avenue. 1887: A one-mile-square area of New Utrecht made up of nine farms, four of which were owned by members of the Benson family, was named Bensonhurst. 1915: Jewish and Italian families from the lower East Side of Manhattan began building two-family homes and semi-attached brick and stucco houses. 1939: Lafayette High School was built at 2630 Benson Avenue. It was later attended by Sandy Koufax, who became a pitcher for the Brooklyn and L.A. Dodgers, and Fred Wilpon, president of the New York Mets. 1964: 1964--The Varrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, establishing a pathway to a more rural area for many Brooklynites. 1975: \"Welcome Back Kotter,\" first aired on ABC. Gabe Kaplan played a remedial student who returned to teach at his alma mater, New Utrecht High School in Bensonhurst. 1979: When the Soviet Union began easing Jewish emigration, many of the newcomers settled in this community. 1989: Yusuf Hawkins, a 16-year-old black youth from East New York, was shot twice in the chest as he was surrounded by a gang of 30 white youths. 1994: Assemblyman Frank J.

And for many people of African heritage across the world, it is here that the biblical Zion is located, making Ethiopia the land where God dwells.   It is also a land repeatedly visited by natural catastrophe and political turbulence, as the numbing photographs of famished families and the constant reports of near civil war over the last two decades painfully confirm.

Mahler's First Symphony, in a touching, beautifully calculated performance led by Seiji Ozawa, showed itself a very human activity. Its bird calls are long and leisurely, syntheses of the human voice. Indeed, the piece is less about nature than about a man's response to it. It also speaks of a Romantic era in which people were still custodians of creation and its principal spokesmen.   Written in 1955, Messiaen's \"Oiseaux Exotiques\" came before the Mahler symphony on Friday's program but postdates it by 50 years. It is a creature of a different world. These are nature pictures that man merely observes. The orchestration is for piano, winds and percussion. There are no strings to purvey the peculiar human sensibility. The bird calls are shrilly accurate, or at least reasonable approximations. They are laid one over the other in a general forest din. There is no hand of man to arrange them into sonata form. The movement does not breathe; it is abstracted, unforgiving symmetry. It pays no heed to human needs at all.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940221","headline":"Did Anybody Check Out Economic Wisdom of Hiring Sliwa?; He Deserves the Job","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/opinion/l-did-anybody-check-out-economic-wisdom-of-hiring-sliwa-he-deserves-the-job-256412.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   It's puzzling to me why there is such a negative uproar in the potential hiring of Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, as host of a daily talk program on WNYC-AM (news article, Feb. 9).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940221","headline":"Winter Olympics: Sports of the Times; Comforting to Know Standards Still Exist","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/sports/winter-olympics-sports-of-the-times-comforting-to-know-standards-still-exist.html","abstract":"  WELCOME to the Rink of Dreams.

One cautiously passed, and collected a beggarly 100 points by defeating the contract by two tricks.

The only two characters in sight are the hard-bitten proprietress, wearing a tight leather skirt and too much gold jewelry, and a well-dressed businessman from Trinidad, who's downing $5 shots of rum and growing more forward with each swig.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940221","headline":"Perez Excels But U.S. Does Not in Robbie Cup","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/sports/soccer-perez-excels-but-us-does-not-in-robbie-cup.html","abstract":"  A month ago, the combination of an injured left ankle and a \"devastating\" game against Switzerland had the United States midfielder Hugo Perez on the verge of quitting.   \"I've been playing a long time,\" said Perez, 23, of Poway, Calif. \"When I come to play, I want to play my best.

That's pretty standard based-on-fact stuff for prime time. But keep your eye and ear on the subtext. It has to do with class in America, tapping into the kinds of lowlifes who figure prominently in the current media obsession with a certain figure skater. The nation's underbelly isn't a pretty sight.    The middle-class centerpiece of \"Baby Brokers\" is Debbie, a single woman in her early 40's who has been pregnant twice but not successfully. Debbie is blunt: \"I can live without a man but I can't live without a child.\" She's played by Cybill Shepherd who, even with stories of being difficult abounding, can deliver classily when the occasion is right. It was in \"Moonlighting,\" and it is here. She's thoroughly persuasive as she puts her faith and money in a couple of con artists seemingly willing to sell their baby to a single mother.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940221","headline":"Winter Olympics; Even With Defeat, Armenian-American Bobsled Is a Success","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/sports/winter-olympics-even-with-defeat-armenian-american-bobsled-is-a-success.html","abstract":"  Somewhere in Armenia, where there might be armed conflict with its neighbor and warring rival, Azerbaijan; where the electricity and gas aren't working and people are cold in their homes and food is scarce; somewhere over there, hoped Joe Almasian and Ken Topalian, people would learn about them and feel proud.

It can, however, be a double-edged sword. The doubler must be certain that the lead he is directing, usually a suit bid by dummy, is the one he really wants. There is a danger that the double will guide the declarer to the winning play, or cause him to retreat to a different slam that will succeed.

The way \"Avenue X,\" the new a cappella musical at Playwrights Horizons, remembers things, the same tensions between blacks and Italian-Americans that have spawned incidents of violence in Bensonhurst and Howard Beach in recent years were already simmering in 1963.   The show, which has a book and lyrics by John Jiler and music and lyrics by Ray Leslee, describes the strife that erupts when two youthful singers, one Italian-American, the other black, try to put together an interracial act for a talent show at the Brooklyn Fox Theater. Although only one busy street separates their neighborhoods, Pasquale (Ted Brunetti) and Milton (Harold Perrineau) live in worlds that go to great lengths to avoid contact.

The discovery sheds new light on the contributions to world history by the vigorous pastoral people who lived in the broad northern grasslands, dismissed as barbarians by their southern neighbors. From these burial customs, archeologists surmise that this culture bore a remarkable resemblance to the people who a few hundred years later called themselves Aryans and would spread their power, religion and language, with everlasting consequence, into the region of present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"Reviews/Music; Works of Dark and Light By Russian Composers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/arts/reviews-music-works-of-dark-and-light-by-russian-composers.html","abstract":"  For at least half a century, music critics in New York have fretted that the city's musical institutions partake too little of its intellectual life. Recent attempts to revive a moribund musical world have included several brainy jolts administered with mixed success by the American Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Leon Botstein. But the program Mr. Botstein presented on Friday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, a fascinating juxtaposition of works by Alfred Schnittke and Sofia Gubaidulina, drew impetus from a less likely source, the long-maligned New York Philharmonic.   Virgil Thomson dismissed the Philharmonic as irrelevant to the city's intellectual life in 1940, and listeners in the 80's had reason to wonder whether the orchestra was even a factor in the city's musical life. But Kurt Masur has given a more thoughtful cast to programming and audience-building, and the Philharmonic's recent Composer Week, devoted to Mr. Schnittke, set a broader agenda in and around the city, spawning an informal festival. The American Symphony program was merely the latest in a remarkable outpouring of performances and discussions of Mr. Schnittke's music and that of other former Soviet composers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"Review/Pop; Catching the 70's Crest, And Fitting In at Last","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/arts/review-pop-catching-the-70-s-crest-and-fitting-in-at-last.html","abstract":"  Rock grew brash and overbearing in the 1970's; it also realized that instead of overthrowing pop, it had become pop. That's the way Redd Kross likes it. At Irving Plaza on Friday night, the band's guitars blared out big major chords, the drums crashed and Jeffrey McDonald, the band's main songwriter, belted out one triumphant song after another.    Redd Kross, which is from Southern California, has been making music for 16 years, since Mr. McDonald was 14 years old and his brother Steve, the band's bassist, was 11. But their band's fondness for jubilantly catchy tunes and 1970's pop-culture references didn't fit in with either underground or mainstream attitudes until the recent 1970's revival. With its new album, \"Phaseshifter\" (Mercury), Redd Kross suddenly seems to have good timing.

Otis Parker, 57, the building superintendent at 1520 Carroll Street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, seldom bothers with the garbage on Sunday. But the sanitation department had asked people to dig their trash out of the hills of snow that were slowly melting in the weekend's springlike thaw, so that trucks could pick it up over the next few days.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"Review/Pop; Texas Takes to the Road","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/arts/review-pop-texas-takes-to-the-road.html","abstract":"  It's no coincidence that the work of songwriters from the Texas panhandle is twangingly austere and mystically obsessed with travel. In these dry Texan flatlands, the overwhelming realities are the sky and the road. Tornadoes randomly dip from above and tear up the land. The road is the inescapable metaphor for life itself. A car is such an essential possession, that like an old-time cowboy's trusted horse, it becomes a companion, invested with its own quirky personality.    This relationship between environment and popular music was made vividly clear in a program called \"The Amarillo Highway,\" which had two performances at the Church of St.  Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, on Friday and Saturday evenings. The show featured two West Texan singers and songwriters, Butch Hancock and Terry Allen, and the author Michael Ventura, doing songs and readings. They were joined by Charlene Hancock singing Mr. Ventura's plaintive ballad \"I Still Go Dancin',\" which imagines the life of Buddy Holly's character Peggy Sue at 51, and by Jesse Taylor who played acoustic guitar with Mr. Hancock. The songs and poems were illustrated with slides showing the landscape around Holly's Lubbock hometown.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"9 Peruvian Military Men Are Sentenced in Killings","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/world/9-peruvian-military-men-are-sentenced-in-killings.html","abstract":"  Hoping to get past the most troublesome human rights case faced by President Alberto K.

The court sentenced Maj. Martin Rivas and Maj. Carlos Pichilingue, the two leaders of the military assassination squad, to 20 years. Gen. Juan Rivero, head of army intelligence planning, got five years. Six others were sentenced to 4 to 15 years.

They encountered pirate attacks at sea and hostile receptions on nearby Asian shores. Still, nearly a million of these \"boat people\" eventually set sail, most in the late 1970's and early 1980's.   That chapter of history has now been officially closed by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. The U.N.'s refugee arm declared last week that fleeing Vietnamese would no longer be automatically eligible for consideration as political refugees; they will be judged on an individual basis like other applicants. Most of the 60,000 boat people remaining in Asian refugee camps can now be legally sent back home.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"Disney Drums Its Fingers as Virginia Debates the Worth of a Theme Park","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/us/disney-drums-its-fingers-as-virginia-debates-the-worth-of-a-theme-park.html","abstract":"  The Walt Disney Company's plan to build a huge American history theme park next to this northern Virginia village 35 miles west of Washington is suddenly taking more political and economic twists and turns than a roller coaster ride.

The decision, to be announced in the next few months, came after a yearlong reassessment of Japan's ambitious but politically troublesome nuclear energy program and stemmed largely from the international outcry last year over Japan's sea shipment from Europe of more than a ton of plutonium, a highly toxic and radioactive material that is a fuel for nuclear weapons. Several of Japan's Asian neighbors banned the shipment from passing through their waters, fearing an accident or terrorist incident.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940222","headline":"Rangers Leave Penguins One Short","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/22/sports/hockey-rangers-leave-penguins-one-short.html","abstract":"  Sure it would have been a better hockey game with Mario Lemieux.
