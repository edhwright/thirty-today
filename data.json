But now that proliferation ranks high among the dangers to U.S. security, the Clinton Administration faces pressure to pursue a third course, military action.    Nonproliferation hawks, impatient with the traditional tactics of diplomacy and denial, cite the gulf war and the subsequent disarming of Iraq as proof that force works. President Clinton has wisely resisted. While keeping the military option in reserve, he has focused on diplomacy and on curbing trafficking in nuclear components to keep countries like North Korea and Iran from building bombs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940122","headline":"Bahamas Burdened by Haitian Refugees","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/22/opinion/l-bahamas-burdened-by-haitian-refugees-959090.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re your Jan. 2 front-page report that the Bahamas are forcing Haitian refugees to flee to the United States: The situation of Haitian nationals illegally in the Bahamas is indeed difficult, one that Bahamian Governments have faced, without help from the international community, for more than 30 years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940122","headline":"Bronx Cheers for Some Stars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/22/sports/bronx-cheers-for-some-stars.html","abstract":"  It didn't surprise Mark Messier, or Adam Graves, or even John Vanbiesbrouck, who does not play for the Rangers anymore.

reminded both father and son of a decidedly different experience at Sportgastein, the highest of the five peaks, at Christmas in 1992. We arrived by bus from Badgastein on a beautiful sun-filled day. Although it was early in the season, snow conditions above the chairlift, aided by grooming, were the best in the valley. The ride on the Kreuzkogellift was exhilarating and the alpine scene from the peak was the most spectacular in the valley. We enjoyed a hot lunch at midstation in a modern cafeteria, using precisely the method the author described, ordering via the attractive photos of the selections.   The author missed the skiing highlight of Sportgastein, the Heilstollen. Departing from the backside of the mountain, this eight-mile descent brings the hardy skier to a bus stop on the mountain road between Badgastein and Sportgastein. Thus it is best run first thing in the morning to catch the arriving buses to Sportgastein or as a last run to catch the final bus back to Badgastein.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"In Search of Edith Wharton","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/travel/in-search-of-edith-wharton.html","abstract":"IT was before the new, best-selling \"Age of Innocence,\" with Michelle Pfeiffer, orgasmic, on the cover: a hot, dusty day in France in 1990.

Dreadlocks required years of not combing one's hair, letting it mat naturally.   Today, dreadlocks are being worn every which way but loose. While Mr. Marley's look is still a favorite among many black men and women, dreads are also short and spiky or tightly coiled.

In THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH: The World Within (Clarkson Potter, $30), Juliet Gardiner adeptly chronicles both the outer world of the grim Yorkshire town of Haworth, where the Bronte children spent most of their lives with their highly educated but eccentric father, the Rev. Patrick Bronte, and the inner world of the imagination to which each sibling turned, first in childhood and then throughout adulthood, for solace in the wake of relentless tragedy. As young children, they witnessed the sudden deaths of their mother and then of their two oldest sisters, Maria and Elizabeth. In the years that followed, with the exception of brief forays at schools, a few trips, scattered attempts at positions outside of Haworth and Charlotte's marriage only a few months before her death at the age of 38, the Bronte siblings spent their time cloistered on the one hand by the secluded atmosphere of their father's austerely furnished parsonage, and surrounded on the other by the vast, windswept expanse of the Yorkshire moors. All four children conjured fantastical characters and kingdoms in miniature \"novels,\" diaries, poems and mock newspapers -- so-called juvenilia that would put many adult writers to shame. Ms. Gardiner, the author of \"The People's War\" and \"Over Here: The G.I.'s in Wartime Britain,\" quotes generously from these documents, as well as from the Bronte sisters' novels, family letters and Elizabeth Gaskell's classic biography of Charlotte Bronte. The books also include fascinating drawings and watercolors by the multitalented family. Ms. Gardiner provides an excellent overview of the Brontes and an insightful journey into the artistic imagination.

In the author's blunt narrative method, the killing process is simply presented in close, horrific detail -- from the stalking of the victims in the city's crime-infested slums to the bizarre distribution of their body parts along the railroad yards on the downtown shores of the Cuyahoga River.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Harrods' Code","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/travel/l-harrods-code-909890.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: I visited Harrods in London in November and was very pleased to see, prominently displayed on the entry doors, their dress code.

Not only do the terrible things that have happened there continue to shape life in the present; memories and half-memories themselves become weapons in the desperate struggles in which Mr. Pinter's people are regularly engaged. The past has the power to disorient, unsettle, obsess, trap and even destroy characters who, as he himself once said, are often already \"at the extreme edge of their living, where they pretty much live alone.\"   The past hangs heavy enough over the 63-year-old Mr. Pinter's new \"Moonlight,\" his first full-length play in 15 years. It's an even more potent force in his \"No Man's Land,\" which is currently enjoying a rare spate of interest. Late in 1992, Mr. Pinter himself performed alongside Paul Eddington in what was, surprisingly, the play's first production in London since its premiere in 1975. And on Thursday another major revival opens on Broadway with the Roundabout Theater Company at the Criterion Center. Jason Robards and Christopher Plummer have the main roles of the alcoholic recluse Hirst and the shabby old bohemian Spooner, respectively, under the direction of David Jones.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Married to the Reich","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/books/married-to-the-reich.html","abstract":"  FRAUEN  German Women Recall the Third Reich.

Many Caribbean islands have white sand, aquamarine seas and lush mountains, but few display luxury goods in such abundance. A commercial hub long before Blackbeard prowled its waters, St. Thomas is now a prime destination for cruise ships, whose passengers rush ashore -- quite in the spirit of 18th-century buccaneers -- in pursuit of duty-free booty.    Others still come to get away from it all, even if a wave of development that followed Hurricane Hugo in 1989 sometimes gives a jolt of urban American reality. Along with new resorts and fast-food restaurants, there is now a Kmart and a Hard Rock Cafe, and luxurious homes have blossomed like frangipani on the northern and eastern hills. The sidewalks and narrow alleys of downtown Charlotte Amalie (pronounced ah-MAHL-ya), the territorial capital and St. Thomas's only real town, prove that there can be gridlock in paradise.  Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas's first permanent European settlement, dates from 1671. Set on a grand circular harbor, the town was laid out by planners in Denmark who had never seen the mountainous, 32-square-mile island, and it has kept much of its colonial charm. (Facing a plan mandating streets on near-vertical surfaces, local builders substituted long stairways; exploration by foot is thus strenuous but rewarding.) With a paucity of through streets and vertigo-inducing roads through the mountains, driving is an exercise in patience and caution, particularly because traffic moves on the left, in cars with left-hand drive.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Playing the Fairest of the Florida Fairways","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/travel/playing-the-fairest-of-the-florida-fairways.html","abstract":"I'M about to experience in the flesh every hacker's lifetime fantasy.

But semantic chicanery is a given in the United States. Consider Rome, N.Y., and Paris, Me. \n\nAt least in Naples there is a reason of sorts for the name. The area was christened in the 1880's, when journalists were touting Florida as the Italy of America -- a restorative land offering sun, joie de vivre and superlativefishing. And Naples, like its sister city, nestles on an inland bay along the western flank of a large land mass. To those who have vacationed on Florida's Atlantic coast, this affluent resort community that swells to 33,000 in peak season may seem an oddity.  The fine sand, like confectioner's sugar, is the first thing one notices. Its origins are somewhat less than romantic, however, the waste produced by coral-eating fish having played a prominent role. Then too, the Everglades are close at hand -- a 40-minute drive -- giving Naples that clearing-on-the-edge-of-the-backwoods feel, particularly if one approaches from Alligator Alley, the highway crossing the state from Fort Lauderdale. The image of Naples circa 1880 as described in a local Chamber of Commerce brochure -- overrun with palmetto scrub, razor-sharp grass and clouds of mosquitoes -- isn't much of a stretch.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"As Bosnians Gain Militarily, They Lose Status as Victims","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/world/as-bosnians-gain-militarily-they-lose-status-as-victims.html","abstract":"  Torn from their homes, bombarded in their encircled capital, deprived of food, water and warmth, the Muslims have been the primary victims of the war here.

Early reviews were nearly unanimous raves, but a sneaky condescension showed through. The wonder, these rapturous reviews hinted, was not that a powerful film had been made about the Holocaust but that Peter Pan had made it.    It took a few weeks for the backlash to set in, as the discussion moved from the entertainment pages to the op-ed pages and talk shows. The old Spielberg rap -- too entertaining for his own good -- came back to haunt him. Why did he make a movie about a righteous Nazi? this argument goes.

The quality of well-aged sirloin or porterhouse that a good restaurant can obtain is usually superior to that available for home cooks.

Magaziner, President Clinton's top health care adviser, to take his temperature on the hottest topic in their lives. On a recent flight to New York, a member of the city's Congressional delegation plied Hillary Rodham Clinton with news clippings on the same subject.   The issue causing such concern is medical education, and the Clinton Administration's proposals for changing it. New York's huge research and teaching hospitals are particularly worried that the Administration's proposals would cut the number of residency positions for medical school graduates nationwide and limit the number of specialists. Cutting 3,800 Residencies?    The New York hospitals say they share the Administration's goal: to lower overall costs and train more of the nation's doctors in basic care. But because about 15 percent of the country's medical residents are now trained in New York State, the hospitals say any changes could affect New York disproportionately. They also say their expertise in specialized medicine is a major drawing card in attracting doctors and making research breakthroughs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940124","headline":"U.N.

The rationale for such programs is simple. The AIDS epidemic is ravaging addicts who inject drugs. The virus is spread through the sharing of contaminated needles and syringes. Therefore, even without curing addicts of their addiction, one can slow the epidemic by giving addicts clean needles in exchange for used ones.   But needle-exchange programs have met fierce opposition from critics who object to any program that implies acceptance of drug abuse and worry that distribution of needles will actually encourage illicit drug injection.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940124","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/24/nyregion/chronicle-973556.html","abstract":"  Not long after KATHLEEN CHALFANT , who plays six roles in the two plays that comprise \"Angels in America\" and ELLEN McLAUGHLIN , who plays the angel and three other parts, met, they discovered that they had something in common: their love for the writing of Virginia Woolf.

President Boris Yeltsin last week named a Cabinet stacked with officials who want to keep the economy firmly under government control. Gone is Yegor Gaidar, the primary architect of market reform; gone, for now, is Boris Fyodorov, who, as Finance Minister, was the only Russian standing in the way of hyperinflation. Mr. Yeltsin appointed only one reformer, Anatoly Chubais, but he is rumored to want out in a few months after he completes his ambitious privatization program.   Running policy for Mr. Yeltsin will be Gorbachev-era apparatchiks like Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who proclaims an end to \"the period of market romanticism,\" and Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, who wants to pump trillions of excess rubles into an economy already running inflation rates above 20 percent a month. No wonder Mr. Chernomyrdin promises to control inflation by \"non-monetaristic\" means.

And the Emerson String Quartet is exploring the late Beethoven and Shostakovich quartets in three concerts at the 92d Street Y. It offered the second installment on Saturday evening.    There are reasons these composers' works sit beside each other so easily. Beethoven's revolutionary posturing and his image as a battler against Fate resonates with Shostakovich's lifelong battle with Soviet officialdom. Such Romanticized biographical comparisons can be stretched only so far; but their quartets, particularly their late ones, are regarded as reliable mirrors of their innermost thoughts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940124","headline":"1894:Gag on Deputies : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/24/opinion/IHT-1894gag-on-deputies-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"ROME - The cue to the adjournment of the opening of the Chamber until February 20 by a Royal decree published in the official gazette last night [Jan. 22] is that Signor Crispi does not propose that the rabid members of the Extreme Left shall have an oppo","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940124","headline":"East Europeans Should Get a Real West European 'Yes' in 1994","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/24/opinion/IHT-east-europeans-should-get-a-real-west-european-yes-in-1994.html","abstract":"At its Brussels summit, NATO promised more to East Central Europe than seemed likely before the Russian elections.
