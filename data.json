That is welcome news indeed -- but what of the prohibition against subjecting defendants to double jeopardy?    The case began two years ago in a restaurant in the town of Gouverneur, in St. Lawrence County near the Canadian border. A 26-year-old woman who had passed out from alcohol was sexually attacked by five male acquaintances. The defendants, indicted for first-degree rape in the County Court, were instead allowed to plead guilty to sexual misconduct, a misdemeanor, before a Town Court justice, who imposed $840 fines but no jail time. The County Court then dismissed the more serious indictment it was considering.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940429","headline":"On My Mind; Only In America","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/opinion/on-my-mind-only-in-america.html","abstract":"  Shortly after Richard Nixon chose to resign the Presidency rather than be thrown out, an Iranian general and a French Ambassador asked me whatever was going on in the United States.

My uncle, who was then a stone mason for Wright, led me past endless Oriental Buddhas, Japanese screens and ceramics. The culmination of the tour was our arrival at the office vault, which was stacked with Wright's Japanese prints.

Nixon was born; the men and women of the armed forces, too young to have their own memories of the Presidency they had been ordered to commemorate, going smartly through their routines; the music from the patriotic repertory, and especially the current First Couple and the four living former Presidents and their wives in the front row like a Norman Rockwell sketch for a new Mount Rushmore.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940429","headline":"Apartheid's Heirs Strut a Final Hour on South Africa's Political Stage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/world/south-african-vote-white-right-apartheid-s-heirs-strut-final-hour-south-africa-s.html","abstract":"  Outflanked by democracy, the band of white supremacists known as the Afrikaner Resistance Movement was a sorry, surly sight today as they lugged rifles and shotguns, pistols and bayonets, picnic baskets and baby strollers into the woods outside of town in angry mourning over the death of white minority rule.   \"We are Boer people!

Mr. Takeshita starts his program with a slide show describing the neighborhood's inception in the 1830's; he then leads a tour through Chinatown's skinny streets to cut free, metaphorically speaking, the maternal spirits. Only then, as he tells several of their stories, can they describe their roles in Chinatown's 160-year history.

This was, after all, the lyric soprano's first full-scale solo recital since being fired by the Metropolitan Opera for \"unprofessional\" behavior. Moreover, her piano accompanist was the artistic director of that very institution, James Levine. And while there were elaborate displays of mutual affection and admiration onstage -- Mr. Levine applauding Ms. Battle, Ms. Battle passing a rose to Mr. Levine -- at least until the encores, much of the audience reaction seemed muted, as if listeners were no longer quite certain about Ms. Battle's superstar status. The applause that consistently interrupted the groups of songs was polite and noncommittal, although one fan's exuberance was so unqualified his cries seemed an embarrassment.    That changed by the end of the evening, though, and at least as far as vocal quality was concerned, the experience of recent months has done no harm. Ms. Battle's mellifluous sound was still intact and perhaps even more controlled and polished than it has been in recent years. She can make a song seem entirely constructed of vowels, eliding all the disruptions of consonants. The voice can slip effortlessly into the ear, leaving behind a silky afterglow. There were some signs of wear, to be sure: a few slides up to pitch, a handful of wavery intonations, a couple of edgy highs. Ms. Battle also shied away from repertory requiring too much technical display. But she can still produce one of the most sensuous sounds on the current opera circuit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940429","time":"1994-04-29

This defense of torture has persuaded many Americans, but it is totally specious. Singapore's streets are clean and safe for reasons far removed from fear of scarred buttocks and a bruised psyche. \n\nSingapore's leaders like to compare their island nation with other countries, but to do so on crime undermines their position on caning. Harsh penalties alone do not deter crime. Consider how Singapore and China treat corruption. China's Government occasionally picks out a corrupt official and executes him. Singapore punishes corruption with a mere jail term.

We know that probably no one has ever ruled as wisely or as long with the consent of the governed. We know that he was the inspiration for and patron of the richest effusion of classical art.

Manhattan CENTRAL PARK: THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN   This 840-acre park, of almost transcendental importance to New Yorkers, is often described as the first example of a deliberately planned urban park in America. Today, it is like an engine gathering steam, a model for the public-private partnership many hope will save the city's parks.   Lord Chatham's famous declaration that \"parks are the lungs of London,\" might have been written for Central Park, a swath of green where some 15 million people come to breathe each year. They come as individuals to sit on grass and benches, or to be part of any number of events, from the New York Marathon to Shakespeare in the Park.   It was just two decades ago, as New York lay mired in a fiscal straitjacket, that Central Park appeared to be dying. Erosion was gnawing away at the park's increasingly brown skin, and floods were commonplace. Garbage was picked up, but all other maintenance had virtually stopped. Even the 36 famed stone arches and bridges -- none identical -- were falling apart.   In truth, while the overall Parks Department work force was cut 23 percent during the fiscal crisis, compared with an average of 13 percent in other city agencies, the deterioration of Central Park was not as serious as at other, less famous parks.   Still, Central Park was Central Park, and in 1979, Mayor Edward I. Koch named the park's most vocal advocate, Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the first administrator of a city park. There was no salary and no budget. Mr. Koch explained, \"You know something about fund raising.\"   As it turned out, people were chomping at the bit to save the park. In its first 10 years, the Conservancy raised more than $50 million, a pace that seems downright laggardly compared with its success so far in the 1990's: to whit, Richard Gilder, a Conservancy trustee, offered the group a $17 million gift, on the condition it raise $17 million from other donors, and that the city contribute $17 million. The city has said yes.   This is not to say everything is perfect, although Ms. Rogers beams with pleasure about the renovation of the long-neglected northern end of the park, Harlem Meer. Cedar Hill, where dogs run, needs to be re-done. Ball fields are badly compacted, and need major drainage repairs. Meadows need to be replanted. Paths need repair.   But the fact is that Central Park has been able to weather a cut in its maintenance staff to 91 from 138.    \"What we've built here is a system that will insure there's a future for the park,\" Ms. Rogers said. RIVERSIDE PARK: PROGRESS, BIT BY BIT    Henry Hudson described this riverside ribbon of green as \"very pleasant, very high and bold.\" Well, you can't change that. But in recent years, the park has grown dirtier, a bit more menacing. Homeless people make homes in bushes, and two weeks ago, a woman was attacked in the park and defended herself with an ice pick.   There has also been an insidious dialectic at work. When Robert Moses redid the park in the 1930's, he spent far less money on the northern part than on the south. Despite several current capital projects to perk up the north, this perception -- and some of the reality -- persists.   But even as the park's workforce has fallen from 54 to 24 over the last five years, new procedures have helped to lessen the sting. One reform was to cut back shrubs in which people could live, an action that has saved three staff hours a day in the middle section of the park.   Other changes have included asking the various City Council members representing sections adjoining the park to allocate money from their portion of the city's capital budget for specific projects.   Other money comes from the Riverside Park Fund and -- in dribs and drabs -- from the city. People also pay for their own projects. For example, except for one summer attendant, the tennis courts at 95th Street are now totally maintained and operated by the Riverside Clay Tennis Association.    The 91st Street playground is similar. Parents raised $120,000 and Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge threw in $70,000. That was enough to hire a landscape architect and begin the job. The first step was to enlarge the pits around the dying pin oaks. Then, the inner part of the playground -- whimsical hippopotamus statues that spray water -- was installed. Other phases will be done as more money is raised.   The other day, Diane Englander, a business consultant who lives at 90th Street and Riverside Drive, was at the playground with her son.   \"It's getting nicer,\" she said of the park she loves. \"There are more flowers, more trees, more improvements to the playground.\" HIGH BRIDGE PARK:  A PERENNIAL PROBLEM    High on the cliffs overlooking the Harlem River and the Bronx, High Bridge Park has long been an example of the trials of maintaining a park that is tremendously important to its neighborhood but a long way, physically and economically, from City Hall.   In the mid-80's, Mr. Stern had ordered a huge cleanup of the park. Dozens of abandoned cars, hundreds of tires, refrigerators, several dead dogs and a human body were found amid the tangled brush.    On a rainy day five years later, at his last public ceremony in the Koch administration, he returned to announce a $1.2 million restoration of the park's landmark, High Bridge Tower, originally used to equalize pressure in the Croton Aqueduct. An arsonist's blaze had wrecked much of it. A homeless man died in the fire.   Today, despite a much-needed lift from three very active Little Leagues, whose participants regularly scrub graffiti and clean litter, it has become more and more difficult to keep up. Debris cast down the steep hill includes old stoves and refrigerators, furniture, any manner of automobile parts and sometimes whole cars.   \"A lot of people seem not to be in tune with recycling here,\" said Milton Rivera, the park's supervisor. \"To them, recycling is dumping.\"   Attendance, particularly when the fine pool is open, is up sharply, but the park's staff has slipped from 24 to 12 over the last four years. Major pedestrian gates must be locked so people don't drive their cars into the park; people must walk in smaller entrances, a bit out of the way. But the big problem is safety, in a park that continues to fight a bitter war of attrition with drugs. It seems somehow fitting that one of the six playgrounds is named for a police officer, Michael J. Buczek, killed nearby in 1988.   So it was that Mr. Stern returned last week to the park within blocks of his boyhood home. He remembered a spring on the side of a cliff. He led a visitor up the steep hill, and, sure enough, pure water still trickled from the earth. But litter was everywhere. He saw clothing and other evidence of a homeless person living in the base of the refurbished -- and locked -- tower.   \"We need a massive cleaning effort, a full-scale assault,\" Mr. Stern said to Mr. Rivera, who ordered his workers to begin work immediately, to uproot hundreds of tires from the vines and weeds. They were joined by dozens scores of reinforcements from other parks.   \"He's doing as well as he could,\" thw Commissioner said. \"Maybe he could do 10 percent more, but this needs 1,000 percent.\" BATTERY PARK: 'A FORLORN WAY STATION'    Battery Park, the first green space in a city cluttered almost from the time the first Dutch settlers arrived in 1625, should be one of the plums of the city. It is more like a shriveled raisin at Manhattan's southern tip.   Some benches are broken, all need repainting. Where grass should be, there is dirt and litter. A sign with a map and guide is so smeared with graffiti it is unreadable. There are potholes on the asphalt where people line up for boats to the Statue of Liberty.   \"Battery Park is marred by a flawed design, inadequate maintenance and neglected landmarks,\" wrote a group of concerned citizens in the process of forming a Battery Park Conservancy. The park, they concluded, is \"a forlorn way station.\" Warrie Price, who is heading the initial efforts to organize the Conservancy, said most of the 375,000 people who work within walking distance of Battery Park -- and the 14,000 predominately new residents who live nearby -- avoid the park because of its dreary appearance. For the 2.5 million passing through to visit Ellis Island and the statue, she says it is an even less pleasant wait.    The Conservancy's first step has been to prepare an architectural plan for redoing the park. It would refurbish the green space, totally rebuild the promenade and perhaps combine the monuments in a \"Heroes Walk.\"   Ms. Price said financing for the $30 million effort seems possible, at least in increments. The National Park Service, which owns Castle Clinton, is interested in replacing the roof -- lost to Robert Moses's never-built bridge to Brooklyn -- and turning the old fort into a new visitor center. Some $2 million in Federal money has been promised to rebuild the seawall. A business improvement district being formed for the downtown area is intensely interested in the project. There is her nascent conservancy.   Ms. Price foresees shade trees over visitors waiting for the boats. She delights over such artistic touches as the dolphins at the base of the elegant lights that have been designed. \"It's in the birthing stage,\" she said. The Bronx PELHAM BAY PARK: BIG SPACES, BIG NEEDS   Pelham Bay Park is the city's largest park, and one of the richest in resources. Within its 2,764 acres lie the elegant Bartow-Pell Mansion and Revolutionary War historic sites, two 18-hole golf courses and -- the centerpiece -- Orchard Beach, called \"The Riviera of New York\" after its completion a half-century ago.   It is also a park in need of help.   \"I have never seen the park in as bad a condition as it is now,\" said Marc Hohenstein, a sales representative who heads an enthusiastic but poor volunteer group called Friends of Pelham Bay Park.   The administrator, Linda Dockeray, takes some issue with such a negative view, pointing to a number of ways in which the park is doing more with less. But she readily concedes the park has deteriorated since she grew up a quarter century ago within walking distance of the park. \"It just takes so long to get something done,\" she said.   Ms. Dockeray shows a visitor areas her 28-worker crew has not been able to get to -- broken benches to eroded trails. Debris from the storm of December 1992 has not been picked up. The Bronx Victory Column, a favored place for wedding pictures, is crumbling.   But it is Orchard Beach where the wear and tear most shows. This 1.1-mile engineering feat -- built mainly on landfill -- has a beach of white sand, two picnic areas and a 45-acre parking lot. On weekend days, more than 32,000 people congregate to catch some rays, eat some hot dogs and dance to Latin music -- though this year plans call for other kinds of music to be added.   The beach has not undergone basic improvements since opening in 1936. It needs more sand, and new bathrooms and recreation area that should have been finished by now are just getting underway because of problems with the first contractor. This will be followed by a $3 million first-stage refurbishing of the basic colonnade rising over the bath houses and refreshment stands. But the bathhouse, which Ms. Dockeray closed due to lack of staffing immediately upon taking her position in 1991, will remain closed. Brooklyn PROSPECT PARK:  DEFINITELY NOT SECOND FIDDLE   For better than a decade, once-dreary Prospect Park has been on a roll. The Prospect Park Alliance, far from being a demure country cousin to the Central Park Conservancy, has boldly seized on flamboyant, joyous strategies to return the park to the status defined by Robert Moses, \"the immediate crown jewel of Brooklyn.\" Among scores of other projects, the Alliance lovingly restored a turn-of-the-century carousel, and began a Halloween walk through the picturesque ravine that little children love to dread.   Both the Grand Army Plaza and Willink entrances are undergoing grand million-dollar restorations. The Lincoln Road Playground is being completely rebuilt. The refurbished zoo reopened last year.   The benefits to Park Slope and Windsor Terrace brownstone owners, among them higher property values, have been much remarked upon. But at least as important is what the park has come to mean to the poorer residents of neighborhoods like Crown Heights, Flatbush and Bedford Stuyvesant.   \"Prospect Park plays a unique role for the the poor,\" said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society and an Alliance board member for many years. \"The utilization has just been going up by leaps and bounds. You just see enormous outpourings of people who create little spaces for themselves.\"   They barbecue in a traditional style (now including Japanese and Korean variations, of course) that has become such a Prospect Park ritual that it has become unthinkable on the part of park bureaucrats to stop it. People play softball, soccer, volleyball, fish and dance to boom boxes on hot afternoons. On Sundays, African and Caribbean drummers gather in an eclectic symphony of pure rhythm.   As the Rollerbladers glide by, as picnickers parade toward the Long Meadow, which has been called the finest landscaped garden in America, something else is happening. It is deep and scary and ongoing. \"We haven't had people managing our forests for the longest time,\" said Tupper W. Thomas, the administrator. \"We keep postponing all the things we can't postpone.\"   The old virgin trees are largely gone. Their descendants -- the oaks, maples, tulip trees, which tried to carry on -- are being supplanted by mulberries and other newcomers. Erosion is intensifying.   \"To take on something like this is just impossible with city money,\" Ms. Thomas said. Accordingly, the Alliance has made the forests its priority. In case you needed to ask, a Woodlands Ball is planned. MACON PLAYGROUND:  A PEOPLE'S PLAYGROUND   This little playground in Bedford-Stuyvesant seems like a terrible place. Equipment has been broken or stolen, crack vials are visible in the dust and adults relax with beers and wine. A bathroom has been locked after becoming a haven for drugs and sex.   It is sad to think the happily playing children have nowhere else to go. But there is a gathering ray of hope on the horizon. Some neighborhood men have banded together to help the bedraggled playground at Tompkins Avenue and Macon Street.   \"This is a classic New York City playground,\" said Julius Spiegel, the Brooklyn Parks Commissioner, pointing to the handball and basketball courts, the checkers tables and seesaws. \"But kids shouldn't have to play in glass.\"   In 1988, a group of men in the neighborhood got together and decided to reclaim the park. They called themselves Black Men Who Give a Damn.   \"For kids in the neighborhood, that's the focal point of their summer,\" explained James Harris Jr., an insurance company employee who lives across the street from the park and started the ball rolling. \"It was time we men took matters in our own hands. If we have to live there, we wanted to make sure there was a place we wanted to live in.\"   Mr. Harris and his compatriots first received Parks Department permission effectively to take over the park, though basic garbage pickup and maintenance remains with the agency. They then mobilized the neighborhood for a full cleaning, and have periodically returned to scrub grafitti. They began to lock the park at night, and during days worked to exclude drug users and others they considered bad influences. \"We did things the police can't,\" Mr. Harris said.   They also began a basketball tournament geared specifically for boys and girls who aren't athletically gifted, as well as an annual block party for everyone in the neighborhood. They raise money with \"oldies but goodies\" parties and other means.   \"We started as simple volunteers to the park,\" Mr. Harris said. \"What we're doing is buying stock in our children. When we get old who's going to put out the checkers for us?\" Queens FLUSHING MEADOWS-CORONA PARK: STRUGGLING PHOENIX   Once these 1,255 acres on Flushing Bay were a vast dumping ground for ashes from the burning of garbage. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald called it \"a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens.\"   Then came two World's Fairs, and after the second in 1964, the park Robert Moses had pushed for three decades finally began to take shape. Today, what was once an ash pile is athletic fields, landscaped meadows, lakes, fountains, playgrounds, zoo, museums and stadiums.   But Flushing Meadows is caught in severe problems just as its dream of restoring its monuments and museums moves toward completion. It is scruffy, even dirty in some parts. The staff struggles to keep up. Popular play areas have been worn grassless, tailgaters from Shea Stadium in the park have seemingly never learned how to throw away an empty can, and many benches need to be refurbished.   Arguably, this is also the city's most cosmopolitan park in what is statistically the most cosmopolitan borough. It is possible for 86 languages to be spoken there on a busy weekend afternoon. Summertimes are one ethnic festival after another: the Colombian festival draws 300,000; the Ecuadorian, 100,000, the Korean, 100,000. There are Muslim prayer services and a dragon boat festival.   \"People who don't have their own backyard use this as their own backyard,\" said Estelle Cooper, the park administrator. \"They have somewhere to go.\"   Harold Sanchez began as a volunteer in the park and is now sports coordinator and field inspector. \"I don't fool anybody and nobody fools me,\" he said by way of introduction.   Mr. Sanchez solved one of the park's biggest problems. Soccer leagues had become violently anarchic, with officials shaking down teams to the tune of more than $40,000 for the right to use fields the city supplies free. And there was another problem on the six soccer fields, where 17 leagues, some with as many as 20 teams, sometimes fitfully shared space. \"People were shooting each other,\" he said.   Mr. Sanchez two years ago brought the teams into the regular organized leagues of New York State, providing insurance for players and spectators and opening up tournaments with teams elsewhere. The new leagues would not put up with the shakedown artists and self-styled landlords.   \"Harold is an unsung hero of the Parks Department,\" said Arne Abramowitz, Mrs. Cooper's predecessor.   For her part, the new administrator is scrambling to make up for a halving of her staff to 47. That means only four maintenance people are available on any given day. The money the long-time Republican loyalist is able to gather from party contributors helps, but is not enough, she says.   She makes her case for more city funds with typical Queens combativeness. \"We're being cut so desperately and we get less money than Manhattan does anyway,\" she said.

Previously only scholars and literary societies were guaranteed access to the Victorian house, situated on the outskirts of Dorchester, 136 miles southwest of London. It was left to the National Trust in 1940 by Hardy's sister Kate and continues to be lived in as a family home by tenants.    The opening of Max Gate offers visitors another piece in the jigsaw of Hardy's life. While the house does not contain any Hardy memorabilia -- his second wife, Florence, gave his study and all its contents to the nearby County Museum in Dorchester -- the garden, referred to in several of Hardy's poems, contains a pet cemetery where Hardy's dog, Wessex, is buried. The exterior of the red brick, turreted house and the drawing room remain as designed by Hardy, who originally trained as an architect. Among the distinguished visitors entertained by the writer in the drawing room were Robert Louis Stevenson, Virginia Woolf and John Galsworthy (who was one of the many visitors bitten by Wessex).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940501","headline":"Small Airlines Expand Into Routes Others Shed","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/01/travel/travel-advisory-small-airlines-expand-into-routes-others-shed.html","abstract":"  As some of the country's largest airlines shed unprofitable routes and shrink capacity, smaller carriers continue to expand.

Still, the traditional camp program of sports, swimming and arts and crafts doesn't appeal to every youngster -- and parents who have postponed making summer plans need not fear that there will be nothing for their offspring to do. Many children seek to develop special interests or talents during the summer months. Some enjoy the circus program and performing arts offerings at Purchase College or at many of the county's Y's. The following is a selected list of some less traditional possibilities. Parents are advised to make arrangements as soon as possible. Classes and Courses    There are children whose idea of summer fun is learning about new subjects and having experiences that aren't usually part of the regular school curriculum or other camp programs. Challenge '94, which is run out of the Gifted and Talented Development Center at Iona Preparatory, Wilmot Road in New Rochelle, offers enrichment classes throughout the year and provides those kinds of mind-stretching activities. This summer program is offered to children from prekindergarten through ninth grade: activities include drama, architecture, chess, business, mythology, politics, environmental issues, creative writing and running a restaurant. Children can choose to attend the entire seven-week program from June 27 through Aug. 12 or take segments from June 27 through July 22 and July 25 through Aug. 12.

It was just a half-century ago that Mr. Miller made his Broadway debut with \"The Man Who Had All the Luck,\" which closed after four performances, to begin a career that in 1949 was to include \"Death of a Salesman,\" a modern classic and the work by which everything he has since written continues to be judged. In a metier where people burn out fast, he's still remarkable for the acuity and scope of his moral vision.   It's this vision, as well as the Miller voice, which remains as strong and unrelenting as a prophet's, that distinguish \"Broken Glass\" and give it a poignance so rare these days that it's almost new-fashioned. The play is ostensibly about a failed marriage, but the failure Mr. Miller examines has less to do with connubial relations than with one man's warped perception of the American way. Like Willy Loman in \"Death of a Salesman,\" the hero of \"Broken Glass\" hasn't misread society's signals so much as he has blindly accepted them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940501","headline":"From Old Houses to Show Houses","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/01/nyregion/from-old-houses-to-show-houses.html","abstract":"  IF it hadn't been for Tom O'Toole's first appearance at the Kips Bay Decorator Show House, he never would have made it to Connecticut.

His subjects are time and the experience of perception. His materials are light, sound, scrim, string, dirt and space -- what he calls the incidental phenomena of the everyday. Like the work of many of his contemporaries in the late 1950's, Mr. Irwin's early canvases were gestural and abstract, though they rapidly evolved, by the early 1960's, into minimal paintings of subtle optical effect. It was not until the early 1970's, having grown discontented with the material limitations of painting, that he changed his course. Forswearing canvas and frame, studio and the gallery system, Mr. Irwin retreated to the desert, where he began to conceive of the ephemeral, site-specific works that would drive his imagination for the next two decades. Now the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles has mounted a traveling exhibition of Mr. Irwin's art, for which it has produced an ambitious catalogue, ROBERT IRWIN (Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles/Rizzoli, paper, $40). The entire project is not without a certain irony, however. After all, as the journalist Lawrence Weschler points out in his evocative essay, Mr. Irwin's art is all about the experience of being there, of seeing the work in situ, which is impossible given the secondary nature of photographs. Indeed, because of the ineffable quality of Mr. Irwin's art, it is hardly surprising that the book's photographs tell the reader little about the essence of the artist's vision. Happily, however, the seven supporting essays more than compensate. With one exception -- a droning, jargon-filled piece by the painter Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe -- all are well written and brimming with insight, offering an invaluable record of this visionary artist's evolution.

In 1981, a statue of the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius that had been put there in 1538 by Michelangelo was removed for restoration. In 1990, the statue was restored to the Campidoglio, not to its original pedestal, but to an air-conditioned glass box in the nearby Capitoline Museum. Since then, debate has raged about whether the emperor should remain in his glass cage, or be restored to the original base. Experts say that even clean rainwater would have a corrosive effect on the statue's 1,800-year-old bronze skin.

The place was Cambridge, Mass., the theater the Orson Welles, and the films were head-turning enough to wreak havoc on the roadways, at the very least. The time was the early 1970's, a period that has come to look like an astonishingly fertile era within the realm of film. It was a turbulent time that witnessed worlds colliding, a major changing of the guard, an enthusiastic embrace of the cinematic past and troubling harbingers of the future.   There are higher points in the history of cinema: the zenith of silent film in the 1920's; the great days of Ford, Hawks, Hitchcock, Sturges, Welles, Lubitsch and Cukor in the early 1940's; and the French New Wave in the late 1950's and early 1960's, which coincided with the most stunning phases in the careers of Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman. But the early 1970's were immensely valuable, since they represented such a colorful crossroads. This was a volatile period, a time of bizarre excesses and vital, unequivocal triumphs.

Of all American powerboys, successful politicians and elite athletes seem most alike in their fierce dedication to goals, their personal selfishness, their sense of entitlement. And more than any other President of our time, Nixon was shaped by the dark side of SportsWorld, that relentless pressure to win at any cost.    \"The president thinks football is a way of life,\" said his old friend the late Coach George Allen. \"He is a competitor.
