The performance gave a listener no reason to challenge his assessment. Certainly the work that closed the program, Charles Wuorinen's Percussion Quartet (1994), showed that no amount of textural and rhythmic intricacy is beyond the grasp of this ensemble's young players.

Sarin, the nerve gas used in the attack, is among the deadliest of all war gases, but it is relatively non-persistent; it is a liquid that evaporates rapidly and is dispersed fairly quickly in an environment with good ventilation. By contrast, its nerve-gas cousins, Tabun and Soman, can contaminate even ventilated areas for long periods.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950322","headline":"Let a Free Market Take Its Course on Sex Shops","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/opinion/l-let-a-free-market-take-its-course-on-sex-shops-119395.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The change in zoning for sex shops in Times Square and elsewhere in New York espoused by Mayor Rudolph W.

It is impossible to excuse the agency's -- and the manufacturer's -- failure to detect and correct the problem much earlier.   It no doubt comes as a shock to most travelers to find that the F.A.A. requires manufacturers to design planes to fly through tiny water droplets in clouds, but not through the larger droplets of freezing drizzle or freezing rain. The rationale is that experience indicated that freezing rain was not a serious hazard. Big jets flying above the weather do not encounter the larger droplets. At lower altitudes, conditions that create such droplets can be forecast, and pilots warned to avoid them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Building A Ballet Of Bodies And Space","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/arts/dance-review-building-a-ballet-of-bodies-and-space.html","abstract":"  \"Ogive,\" Eliot Feld's fourth new ballet for his company's current season, shares the nostalgic perfume that wafts through his other recent works to French music.

Mei-mei (Yang Kuei-mei), a chic young real estate agent, misplaces the keys to a vacant duplex apartment in a spanking new high-rise.

People looked at him, they saw someone else. Here he was, doing Arnold Palmer's whirlybird, out-of-balance finish. There he was, a pile of golf balls bulging from the front of his shirt, doing Craig Stadler.   When they heard him, it was always someone else as well. Seve Ballesteros or Chi Chi Rodriguez. The lead singer of the rock band Jake Trout and the Flounders was another of his impersonations. He could do everybody.   This year, Peter Jacobsen has added another golfer to his repertory. It is by far his best impression yet. It is of a 40-year-old reborn player, a pretty long hitter and great iron player who has become a short- game wizard, a personable guy who interacts with the galleries, laughs at bad breaks and acts the same way whether he's shooting 75 or 65.   Peter Jacobsen is doing . . . Peter Jacobsen. And what an act it is. A man who had won four tournaments in his career has already won half that many this year. And he has a tie for second and a third-place finish as well. He has won more money in three months ($690,351) than he did in any of his previous 18 individual seasons. Always a good player, Jacobsen is now borderline great.   Put it this way: the $3 million Players Championship gets under way Thursday at the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass with a luminous array of golfing talent -- a field that includes the top 36 ranked players in the world -- and Jacobsen has to be considered one of the favorites. He no longer has to do Nick Price or Greg Norman or Nick Faldo or Ernie Els. He now has the game to think about beating them.   Jacobsen is the leading money- winner on tour, the leading all- round player, No. 1 in four statistical categories and certainly among the favorites. And he is exactly the same person in every way but one. For the first time in his career, he has developed a short game. For someone whose touch was always impeccable when it came to the nuances of an impression -- he would always have the telling little raise of the eyebrow or the habitual movement down cold -- he had no real touch around the greens. Last year he finally broke down and visited the short-game guru Dave Pelz in Boca Raton, Fla.   \"I think we're all a little hard-headed,\" Jacobsen said. \"We don't realize our shortcomings, our weaknesses. I realized after all these years of playing golf and looking at all my stats that my putting and chipping were always somewhere near the back.\"   This is the concrete answer. All the intangibles like confidence, self-assurance, rededication, they all come from an ability to get the ball in the hole. And that is something Jacobsen is doing better now than at any time in his life. A quick analysis of his statistics today versus last year at this time is revealing: he has added 10 yards of distance to his drives, averaging 269.7 this year; he is ranked first in greens in regulation compared with 53d; he is using his length and his touch to birdie more par 5's, ranking third in that department compared with 65th last year.   \"Peter is getting closer and closer,\" Pelz said. \"For years he had been focusing on mechanics in the short game. Now he is focusing his mind's eye on speed and touch. I'll tell you, if you put Tom Kite's short game on Peter Jacobsen, you'd have the best player in the world.\"   What you have right now is one of the best-liked players in the world. Jacobsen was always amiable enough, and that has broadened and developed into a comedic on-course demeanor that reaches out and embraces galleries. It stems from something his father told him just before he died in 1992, when Peter asked him what was the most important thing about golf, the setup or the grip or tempo.   \"He looked at me and said, 'Peter, it's a sense of humor,' \" Jacobsen said.   That is one thing that always came naturally to Jacobsen. Now, with the work on the one thing that didn't, he has become a complete player. CHIP SHOTS    The heads of five of the world's leading professional golf organizations met here Wednesday to discuss existing international competitions and to map out plans for something that could eventually resemble a world tour. . . . . ARNOLD PALMER was named as the captain of the United States team for the 1996 Presidents Cup. DAVID GRAHAM will again be the captain of the International team.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Japanese Police Find Chemicals And Gas Masks at Sect's Offices","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/world/terror-tokyo-overview-japanese-police-find-chemicals-gas-masks-sect-s-offices.html","abstract":"  A police search of a religious sect's training compound on Wednesday turned up about two tons of chemicals, including some similar to those used in the nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, the police said today.

The title character (Nina Petri) is a woman who has been under a man's thumb for as long as she can remember. Brought up by her repressive father in the dreary apartment he owns, she has been his sole caretaker since he was crippled in a terrible accident.

Approval of the rule was a victory for House Republican leaders because it limits the amount of debate and the number of possible amendments, precluding challenges to many contentious parts of the bill.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Japan Needs to Face Its Shameful Past","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/opinion/l-japan-needs-to-face-its-shameful-past-337095.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Japan Confronting Gruesome War Atrocity,\" your March 17 front-page article on Unit 731 of the Japanese Imperial Army, is a superb piece of reporting and a timely reminder that Japan has a great deal of ugly World War II history it has yet to confront.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Harassment Case Tarnishes Cornell Star's Luster","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/nyregion/harassment-case-tarnishes-cornell-star-s-luster.html","abstract":"  Each fall, nearly 2,000 Cornell University undergraduates enroll in Psychology 101, taught by Prof. James B.

The screens are about 8 inches long and 1.75 inches high, and can accommodate two 40-character lines of text. The $2 million system will be installed during the summer and will be used at all performances beginning next season.   Titling has been a matter of considerable dispute at the Met, one of the last major opera houses to resist simultaneous translation.

The action has bred suspicion that the Secretariat is responding to political pressures from the conference's Chinese hosts or such powerful participants as the Vatican.   In several instances, the denials resulted from direct pressure. The Chinese, who were eager to have Beijing as the conference site, pledged that the forum would be open to all relevant non-governmental as well as governmental groups. However, they asked, and got, the U.N. to deny credentials to women's organizations from Taiwan and Tibet, their political adversaries. The Vatican does not want to hear from Catholics critical of the church's views on family life and abortion. It tried to have the U.N. deny credentials to Catholics for a Free Choice and its sister groups in Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay, but were repulsed after an outcry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"A Quirky Whitney Biennial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/arts/art-review-a-quirky-whitney-biennial.html","abstract":"  BY now so much has been said about this year's Whitney Biennial that you might almost think the show has come and gone. First there was the early hoopla when the museum identified the artists to be included and even showed slides of their works. Then came the inevitable backlash, the published lists of those neglected, the complaints about the ones chosen: that there aren't enough young and hip artists, that there is too much painting and not enough Conceptual and political art, that some artists are too well known, others are completely unknown and a few are just friends of the exhibition's curator, Klaus Kertess. Critics agreed about only one point: that the 1995 biennial isn't like the politically top-heavy 1993 show.   Biennials are the art world's Rorschach tests. They are what you bring to them. I like this one, despite the eccentric and occasionally pallid choices Mr. Kertess has made. The show, which opened yesterday, is low key. It feels spacious and respectful: each work has room to breathe and a viewer has room to think, since the emphasis is on art that doesn't harangue you with its message.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Inspector Reported Crack in Wall of Harlem Building Last Year","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/nyregion/inspector-reported-crack-in-wall-of-harlem-building-last-year.html","abstract":"  Last October, a city housing inspector found and reported a crack in a wall of the Harlem apartment building that partly collapsed on Tuesday, a defect that private experts say could have been a sign of structural problems.

And this impulse is vividly underscored by Ronald Hayman's magisterial new biography, a biography that not only explicates the many intimate correspondences between Mann and his own heroes but that also demonstrates just how minutely the overarching themes of his work -- art, death and illness -- remained rooted in his own emotional and familial conflicts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Montana Cuts Homosexual Acts From List of Registered Crimes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/us/montana-cuts-homosexual-acts-from-list-of-registered-crimes.html","abstract":"  Feeling political heat from around the state and the country, the Montana Senate executed an about-face yesterday, deleting homosexual acts from a list of crimes for which convicts must be registered their entire lives.

His American wife, Jennifer Harbury, received word that he had been seen alive in a secret military prison and began trying to find out what happened to him.

Adding to the shame of these events for America is the fact that the man implicated in the killings was a Guatemalan colonel trained by the U.S. Army.   Ms. Harbury was given contrary reports of her husband's death.
