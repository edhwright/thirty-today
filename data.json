But those days are over. Various operators of the theater have failed, and its latest incarnation as the Club Carousel has also folded. Its operator, Michael J. Sullo of Milford, is the target of investigations by several state agencies. A Night to Forget     By all accounts, the theater reached its low point on New Year's Eve. Joyce and Daniel O'Neill of Shelton came that night, looking forward to dinner, dancing and a show.    But for the first two hours, all they got for their $165 was salad, rolls and a television set rolled onto the stage for entertainment. There were only 30 people in the audience.    \"The whole atmosphere was strange and unprofessional and it became apparent we weren't going to get what we paid for,\" Mrs. O'Neill said. \"Our night was completely ruined.\"    After being denied a refund, they complained to the police and the Better Business Bureau.    The theater's landlord has taken Mr. Sullo to court, seeking more than $150,000 in back rent. On Wednesday Mr. Sullo, who also worked as an insurance agent and investment broker, was arrested on charges of writing bad checks and bilking a client out of more than $40,000. On Friday the State Banking Commission accused him of defrauding his brokerage customers. When some of those customers asked for their money, the commission said, Mr. Sullo told them he had diverted it to run the theater.    The failure of the theater has upset many in Fairfield County. It opened in 1977, and despite ups and downs, remained in business until 1992. Last September it reopened as Club Carousel. 'A Real Tragedy'     \"There was an abundance of excellent theater there over the years, and it's a real tragedy what's happened,\" said Douglas Bora, a local actor who appeared in Club Carousel's only major show, \"South Pacific.\"    \"I did my first show as a child actor in 1928 and in all these years I never saw anything like the monstrosity that the theater became in its closing weeks,\" Mr. Bora said. \"We need a dinner theater there, and I just hope that somebody will come along and open it up again and return it to its previous high quality.\"    Mollie Klaff Passero, a former actress who appeared in one of the theater's earliest shows, said, \"It was a marvelous place to see a musical -- it was practically like being on Broadway\"    Ms. Passero, the owner of Klaff's Lighting and Decorative Hardware Stores in Norwalk and Westport, said, \"The theater's closing has left a major void.\"    Despite his legal and financial problems, Mr. Sullo denied any wrongdoing. \"The Carousel closed because it just didn't do well and that's all there is to it,\" he said. \"I'm not going to make any other comment about all of these allegations other than to say that in the end I will be completely vindicated. I don't owe anybody anything.\" Bait and Switch     But former Club Carousel employees, who have filed complaints with the State Labor Department to recover more than $60,000 in back pay, say Mr. Sullo mismanaged the theater and often lied to customers.    \"It was a bait-and-switch scam where we would put on a good show like 'South Pacific,' but then the next week we would put on a rinky-dink show and charge the same admission price,\" said Edward C. Moffat of Stamford, who said he was hired last summer as a bodyguard for the actors but ended up working as an unofficial manager.    Mr. Moffat said the Club Carousel's first show, \"South Pacific,\" starring Jamie Farr, closed a week early in November because the theater lacked the money to pay the actors. At Mr. Moffat's suggestion, the theater said the show was closing because Mr. Farr had to return to California because of the brush fires there.    \"I didn't think a few white lies to the public would hurt,\" Mr. Moffat said.  \"But it got out of control. If I knew how far all of this would go, I never would have been involved.\" 'Very Disturbing'    Zalina Hoosein, senior business representative for Actors Equity, and Robert Malcolm, Mr. Farr's agent, said they were upset when the theater's owners blamed Mr. Farr for the show's closing. \"It was very disturbing to read all of that because there was only one reason the show closed early, and that was because there were insufficient funds to pay the actors,\" Ms. Hoosein said.    Robert Rising of Trumbull, who had bought eight tickets totaling $466 for the final Friday performance of \"South Pacific\" -- which was canceled -- said he was unable to get his money back.

The five officials, all political veterans, lost much of their clout with the recent elimination of the city's Board of Estimate, a powerful legislative body in which the borough presidents controlled 5 of the 11 votes.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Russian Entrepreneurs Aren't All Gangsters; Skip the Robber Barons","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/opinion/l-russian-entrepreneurs-aren-t-all-gangsters-skip-the-robber-barons-825840.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   in \"What's Good for the Mafia Is Good for Russia\" (Op- Ed, Dec. 26), Michael Scammell compares the situation in Russia to the \"robber baron days\" in the United States, justifying this as a necessary stage in the emergence of a market economy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Stockton and Murphy Stroke a Blow for the Senior Class","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/sports/pro-football-stockton-and-murphy-stroke-a-blow-for-the-senior-class.html","abstract":"  In an effort to prove that youth, strength and length are not necessarily golf's most important commodities, a pair of men in their 50's are poised to administer a potentially embarrassing lesson to the best golfers on the PGA Tour.

Because they are dormant, this is a good time of year to think about having them pruned, cabled or braced and checked. Or if they are property liabilities, they may even have to be cut down, a sad case. But this drastic step is necessary particularly if the tree is diseased in its core and has rotted.   There are two basic reasons why trees are trimmed when they are dormant. The most obvious one, of course, is that the deciduous trees are leafless and it is easy for the arborists to see what branches need to be cut out. Getting to the twigs and limbs is simplified. The other reason is that the trees will not bleed. That is the sap is not running inside the tree's core. When the sap is flowing up the trunk, it will ooze from any cuts and run down the trunk making an unsightly mess. Though this bleeding does not harm the tree, the appearance often worries homeowners and quite often insects are attracted to the sap causing a secondary problem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Collapsing Into Himself","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/books/collapsing-into-himself.html","abstract":"  WILD CAT FALLING By Mudrooroo.

Miss Wormwood is a proponent of the Mortimer J. Adler Paedia Proposal, that Great Books about great ideas and deeds should be introduced in the elementary grades (Adler, 1985); cf. Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\"--\"Book learning is most of what a teacher can give.\" (Bloom, 1987). This is the if-you-build-the-schoolhouse-the-pupils-will-come-and-worship-gods-of-learning school of education.*  2. Calvin may be an example Howard Gardener refers to as Multiple Intelligences (Gardner, 1993). though Gardener refuses to admit it. Here Calvin clearly exhibits strengths in linguistic, scientific and outerspatial intelligence.**  3. You can see from Calvin's obvious level of emotional and intellectual commitment to comic books that reading them puts him in a state of what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines as flow: \"When challeges are high and personal skills are used to the utmost, we experience that rare state of consciousness . . . . We feel involved, concentrated, absorbed.\" (Csikszentmihalyi, 1993).***  4. Miss Wormwood is a devoted disciplinary disciple of either William or Jesse James. **** Her oppoents argue displeased with Calvin's ahistoricity. However, Calvin could counter that many famous and successful people had little regard for history, viz. Henry Ford, \"History is more or less bunk\", and cf. Ronald Reagan, \"Facts are stupid things\" et passim.    5. Miss Wormwood takes the neoconservative approach along with Adler, Bloom, E.D. Hirtsch and William Bennett, who hunger for a capacious store of common knowledge and skills.*****    6. Gardner is insistent that Calvin's strong domains of intelligence not be labeled \"dumb\" and \"useless\" by an uncaring educational system that has only \"impatience with approaches that cherish the individuality of each student.\" (ibid) Bloom, however, knows Calvin is dumb and useless. Sociologist Paul Fussell adds that what Calvin knows is not only dumb and useless but bad. (Fussell, 1991).  7. Fussell reports there are 60 million functionally illiterate adults in the United States, with another 60 million reading at a fifth grade level. Only 6 percent of the population report having read at least one book in the last year. (ibid)  8. Calvin did read at least one bona fide book last year, in addition to \"Captain Thermonuclear etc.\" It was Robert Fulghum's \"Everything I Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.\" At least he started it.+   9. Calvin can only agree with Gardner that \"a significant part of our educational malaise lay in the mindless instruments that were conventionally used to assess student learning\" (Gardner, op cit) and with John Dewey that \"In contrast to the 'testing society' I think that the assessment approach and the individual-centered school constitute a more noble educational vision. Both are more inkeeping with American democratic and pluralistic values (Dewey, 1938). \"Relativism!\" scoffs Bloom. BAD, says Fussell.  *Hah! Wrong! Even if you build it, they will still sit around reading comic books. (Hobbes)  ** Note: there is no entry for \"Captain Napalm's Thermonuclear League of Liberty\" in E.D. Hirsch's \"A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What Our Children Need to Know\" (Hirsch, 1989).  ***But what is the poor lad getting excited about? Trash like Captain Thermonuclear? Doesn't he know that in Hobbes' words, life is \"mean, nasty, brutish and short\"? (Hobbes, 19TK).+  ****This was still being debated when Education Life went to press.  7:  [  NO! NO! You journalists are all the same. What I actually told the Republican National Convention in 1988, quoting from John Addams, of course was this:   \"Facts are stupid things, stubborn things, I should say.\" -- Ronald Reagan. Incidentally, if you tip either this footnote symbol or your head on its side, you'll see it makes a very nice, small portrait of me.   *****That capacious-store business is actually a clever bit of plagarism on Nash's part but we heard somewhere that, if you confess that kind of thin it in a footnote to a footnote, you're all right. (Eds.)  + Actually, he didn't even start it. He read the cover and figured that was all he needed to know.

Among studio lights, scrims and screens, his subjects were revealed in their incomparable, irreplaceable beauty. His new volume, ANIMA (Arts Alternative Press, 3200 Valmont Avenue, Suite 7, Boulder, Colo. 80301; $29.95), continues to disrupt the cavalier perception of nature by focusing on Homo sapiens. In 28 dramatic photographs, Mr. Balog portrays his figures as if they were fossils obscured by the darkness of history. His photographs are of individuals -- human and chimpanzee -- encountering one another with no context but light and space. His photographs capture the radiance of pure expression in Isabella Rossellini's face and in the chimp who cradles it. The accompanying text, similarly denuded of metaphor, is itself what the photographer calls a \"psychological labyrinth,\" an accretion of typography and meditation on our animal nature and our unnatural dissociation from it.

Men are defective: brutal, competitive, exploitative, insensitive, disconnected from meaningful social relationships, out of touch with their feelings and oblivious to things they do not want to hear. It is impossible to get them to do housework, even when they are unemployed. Why not simply replace the unit? They just lie around and make noise. Feeding them is an act of charity.

Not only does it add variety, stimulation and beauty, but it expresses how we feel. To see color, we need light, which reflects different colors on different wavelengths. Most objects appear to have color because their chemical structures absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. Physics aside, we also think in terms of colors: We \"see red,\" we're \"green with envy,\" or we feel \"purple passion.\" And \"once in a blue moon\" we can ace a quiz. So give it a try; who knows, your prospects may be rosy. By Fran Handman     1. The colors that appear in a rainbow are called the color spectrum. What are its colors that are visible to the human eye?     2. Part of the spectrum is invisible, comprising rays of various wavelengths. What are their names and why are they invisible?     3. Which color in the visible spectrum has the shortest wavelength? The longest?     4. A colorant is any substance that imparts color to a given product like ink, paint, crayons or chalk. When is a colorant a dye and when is it a pigment?    5. Define and name the primary colors.     6. What colors of light are blended to make white light?     7. What colors in paints are mixed to make black?     8. All but one of the following colors -- cerulean, azure, amber, cobalt, cornflower -- are similar; which is the exception, and why?    9. Match the following terms with their correct definitions: (a) tone, (b) shade, (c) tint; (x)mixing gray with a color, (y) mixing white with a color, (z)mixing black with a color.    10. A monochromatic color scheme is a) one color; b) shades of gray or brown; c) shades, tones and tints of a single color.    11. Match the following terms with their definitions: (a) hue, (b) value, (c) chroma; (x) The amount of light reflected from a colored object; (y) measurement of saturation of a color; (z) a particular shade or tint of a given color.    12. At what age can infants first see colors: 2 months; 3 months; 6 months?    13. Why can't humans see color in dim light?    14. The most common type of color-blindness is the inability to see (a)any color; (b) red and green; (c) yellow and blue.    15. Only men may be color-blind: true or false?    16. Black is worn worldwide to indicate mourning: true or false?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Helping Russian Immigrants Start Life Anew in New Haven","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/nyregion/helping-russian-immigrants-start-life-anew-in-new-haven.html","abstract":"JOYCE HIRSCHHON, a retired communications teacher, held up a sugar bowl. \"Say it after me: the sugar is in the bowl,\" she said, slowly and distinctly, to Kseniya Kirichenko and Inna Levina, recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

Its comparatively recent, 17th-century origins deny this metropolitan city the ruins and tombs of New Delhi, or New Delhi's sense of having been privy to decisive moments in India's past. It lacks the fast-paced cosmopolitanism of Bombay, nor can it parallel Calcutta's down-at-the-heels charm, its bequest of colonial-era stateliness, and its intellectual and political vitality. Tamil Nadu's capital offers no quota of palaces, not much by way of decaying princely pomp. On the face of it, Madras appears to be just another large, bustling Indian city, densely populated and beset with challenges. Yet a thoughtful visitor can push beneath the surface reality to discover fascinating and unsuspected facets of city life. Madras, too, has admirers alive to its subtle and varied charms.\n\nMadras connoisseurs tend to synchronize their visits with the short southern winter in December and January, to avoid the sultry summer climate. Winter is the period too of the Madras music season, an annual citywide celebration, extended over three or four densely programmed weeks from mid-December to mid-January, of Carnatic music -- the ancient, highly evolved musical system of south India.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Tough Agenda for Clinton Trip","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/world/tough-agenda-for-clinton-trip.html","abstract":"  President Clinton will cast himself and the United States as forces for stability as he begins his visit to a divided and anxious Europe.

It is the policy of this state that properties of a similar nature within a taxing jurisdiction be assessed at an equal percentage of fair market value.    Dr. Goon would have us believe that the largest single component in determining total fair market value is the difference in property taxes.

In addition, the school's three-year daily average attendance, the state's lowest, routinely showed a quarter of the students missing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Journal; The Silver Lining","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/opinion/journal-the-silver-lining.html","abstract":"  On his Inauguration Day as the new Mayor's Best Showbiz Friend, Ron Silver failed to give Rudolph Giuliani the most essential advice a professional actor can bequeath to an amateur: Never share a stage with a child or a dog.

RIPLEY UNDER WATER By Patricia Highsmith. Black Lizard/Vintage Crime, $10. Tom Ripley is an intelligent, cultured gentleman who dabbles in art, music and, occasionally, murder. A popular though unlikely hero, he has appeared in several of Patricia Highsmith's books without ever getting caught. But in this one, Ripley's new neighbors seem to know a great deal about the skeletons in his closet, needling him not for extortion but for pleasure. In 1992 our reviewer, Julian Symons, said of Ms. Highsmith, \"One closes most of her books -- and her equally powerful and chilling short stories -- with a feeling that the world is more dangerous than one had imagined.\" For readers unacquainted with Ripley, this publisher has also reissued THE BOY WHO FOLLOWED RIPLEY ($10), a 1980 novel in which he becomes the protector of a runaway teen-ager, and RIPLEY'S GAME ($10), published in 1974, in which he manipulates someone into committing murder.  ORIGINS RECONSIDERED: In Search of What Makes Us Human By Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. Did the human species evolve simultaneously in Africa, Asia and Europe? Did morality originate with the emergence of human beings or can it be traced farther back? These are among the questions discussed by Richard Leakey, the paleoanthropologist. \"It is not often that a major participant in so contentious a field delivers such a vivid, generally evenhanded summation,\" John Noble Wilford said here in 1992.  I, TITUBA, BLACK WITCH OF SALEM By Maryse Conde. Translated by Richard Philcox. One World/Ballantine, $10. The author, a native of Guadeloupe, has created a rich novel from the history of another West Indian woman, the real Tituba, who played a central role in the Salem witch trials. In 1992 our reviewer, Howard Frank Mosher, praised Ms. Conde's \"gift for storytelling and her unswerving focus on her characters.\" Ballantine has also reissued JUMPING SHIP: And Other Stories, by Kelvin Christopher James ($10). Born in Trinidad, Mr. James focuses on the intersection of American and Caribbean cultures in the present day. He evokes \"a particular world by virtue of his energy and generosity of spirit,\" Tom Piazza said here in 1992.  DAYS OF OBLIGATION: An Argument With My Mexican Father By Richard Rodriguez. Penguin, $11. The author, who grew up in the United States, discovers that Mexico, the land of his parents, holds more meaning for him than he would ever have believed. Other assumptions about being Roman Catholic and gay are also examined in these autobiographical essays. In 1992 our reviewer, David L. Kirp, said, \"The self remains Mr. Rodriguez's best and truest subject.\"  BLACK DOGS By Ian McEwan. Bantam, $7.95. In this novel-cum-parable, the disintegration of a marriage is related by the couple's son-in-law, Jeremy. In writing his memoir, he keeps returning to a mystical encounter between June (his mother-in-law) and a pair of fierce black dogs. In 1992 our reviewer, Bette Pesetsky, praised \"the richly designed weaving of a truly sinister and very real postwar Europe into these lives.\"  ANATOMY OF LOVE: The Mysteries of Mating, Marriage, and Why We Stray By Helen Fisher. Fawcett Columbine, $12.50. The complexities of courtship are reduced to biological imperatives in this social and sexual analysis. For instance, couples are most likely to divorce after four years because they've had enough time to raise a child past infancy and can then feel free to vary the gene pool. Mary Batten, the author of SEXUAL STRATEGIES: How Females Choose Their Mates (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $12.95), also sees parenting responsibilities as central. Women are more selective about mating, she explains, because they will largely deal with the consequences. Both books \"are fun and sometimes even delightful to read,\" Natalie Angier said here in 1992.  DUNSTER By John Mortimer. Penguin, $10.95. A British accountant in the midst of a boring middle age has one element in his life that is all too interesting: the constant reappearances of an obnoxious schoolmate, Dick Dunster, who remains his nemesis. Last year our reviewer, Jane Smiley, called the novel \"a delicious read, like a meal you expect to enjoy, and do.\"  MATISSE, PICASSO, MIRO AS I KNEW THEM By Rosamond Bernier. Knopf, $35. The author, who co-founded the French art magazine L'Oeil, drew upon her many years in Paris for the reminiscences and interviews that fueled her popular lectures, transmuted here into essays. \"They already have a period charm, evoking a smaller, simpler and probably more agreeable art world,\" Michael Peppiatt said here in 1991.

Beside the bike is a young woman, warmly suggesting something few real men could refuse: Sign up here, she says -- for a class in motorcycle mechanics.    The class is presented after work, free, in one of the company classrooms. If you don't like motorcycles, how about a real estate license or learning WordPerfect? And if the worker lacks the basic reading or math skills to master the course -- no problem.

The Germans came close when, in the 1920's, when they coined the term Neue Sachlichkeit, or New Objectivity, for the morbidly precise images of painters like George Grosz and Otto Dix. The late 1950's brought the Nouvelle Realistes, a French movement that included Arman and Raymond Hains, who worked with such things as found objects and filched kiosk posters. The phrase cropped up briefly in the United States as a forerunner to the Pop Art label, most prominently as the title of an exhibition of works by Rosenquist, Lichtenstein, Warhol and others at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1962.   Although I can't quite remember, there may have been some additional runs up the flagpole in the 1970's, what with Conceptual Art and performance pieces (Chris Burden having himself shot in the arm and Vito Acconci masturbating under the floorboards at the Sonnabend Gallery), and again in the 1980's, when appropriation was the rage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940109","headline":"Serbs Call Truce But Keep Shelling","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/world/serbs-call-truce-but-keep-shelling.html","abstract":"  Hours after unilaterally declaring a cease-fire, Bosnian Serbs resumed their shelling of Sarajevo's airport today, preventing Bosnia's Muslim President from attending peace talks in Germany with the President of Croatia.

All of them turned the ad down. \"This is . . . the sort of subject matter some portion of our audience would consider intrusive into their moral or religious beliefs\" was a typical response -- and the commercial was shown only in the Buffalo area.   Seven years later, viewers of four major TV networks and several cable networks can see a condom leap from a chest of drawers just as a couple -- genders unspecified -- are about to make love. They can see a woman and a man, rapidly undressing and half out of breath, and hear the woman's cool rejoinder when, in answer to her question, the man confesses to having forgotten protection. \"Then forget it,\" she says. They can do this because the Clinton Administration has committed itself to persuading youngsters to use condoms or practice abstinence in this frightening age of AIDS -- and because Americans are finally beginning to accept the fact that sexual activity, however ill advised or premature it may be, is for most young people close to inevitable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Abroad at Home; What Might Have Been","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/abroad-at-home-what-might-have-been.html","abstract":"  Madeleine K.

This aspect of American musical life is being celebrated in a six-concert series at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, that endson Saturday night. The series, organized by Ben Neill, the Kitchen's music curator, doesn't really deserve its Germanic and portentous title, Gruppen II (the subtitle, as for Gruppen I last season, is \"Chamber Music for the 21st Century\"). At least on paper, the program promises a mix of jazz, Minimalism, new age, rock, hardware experimentation and art music, which may not produce anything more coherent than an evident determination to avoid too much coherence.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"NATO's Low Bosnia Flights Feed Talk About Air Strikes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/world/nato-s-low-bosnia-flights-feed-talk-about-air-strikes.html","abstract":"  NATO warplanes enforcing the no-flight zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina flew at unusually low altitudes over Sarajevo today, dropping flares used to thwart heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"The Troubles of 'A Perfect World'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/movies/the-troubles-of-a-perfect-world.html","abstract":"  Just about everyone in Hollywood was convinced that the film \"A Perfect World\" would emerge a winner.

Zusaan Kali Fasteau, a saxophonist and flutist, had people huddling in the lobby, and Julia Heyward's songs, often politically driven, had a grinding flair for the obvious.   Ms. Fasteau opened the show, and although she has an overabundance of instrumental virtuosity, she hasn't figured out a context in which it sounds good. Ms. Fasteau has lived around the world and assimilated music from India, Japan, and Arabic and black Africa. She can play, too: on various flutes Ms. Fasteau, backed by the bassist William Parker and the drummer Michael Wimberly, echoed the various textures of what she had studied, and with idiomatic control. An old beef about improvised music says that it is more fun to play than to hear; in her case it might be true, as her pieces showed little or no narrative development, making them dull.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"NATO Plan Welcomes New Eastern Partners; Russian Scare Tactics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/l-nato-plan-welcomes-new-eastern-partners-russian-scare-tactics-832030.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"The sizable vote for an ultranationalist in Russia's parliamentary elections,\" a Dec. 29 article from Moscow maintains, \"is providing the Government with a further weapon in its campaign against the extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to Central and Eastern Europe.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Essay; Absent At the Creation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/essay-absent-at-the-creation.html","abstract":"  \"Nothing is more contemptible,\" Joseph Alsop told me when I took up this line of work, \"than a columnist without a Weltanschauung.\"   A coherent worldview is tough to come by these days because the main threat to freedom has shifted from militant Communism to what John Leo has named \"ethnomania,\" more tribalism than nationalism.

The drama and dignity of the Phrygian cadence, the wildly expressive melisma of Moorish origin, the delicate sensuousness of the guitar: all create pressure on composers to keep these assets intact. Perhaps one reason German music, to take one example, has been explored more widely and deeply than Spain's is that its folk materials are relatively uninteresting and therefore lend themselves to easy manipulation.   Saturday evening's concert by Sharon Isbin and Benita Valente at the Metropolitan Museum offered guitar solos and songs with guitar accompaniment. An evening's worth of \"Spanish style\" has its dangers, for once one sees past the natural riches one begins to question how interestingly they are being used. In the case of \"El mirar de la maja,\" one of the six Granados \"Tonadillas escritas en estilo antiguo,\" the answer would be wondrously well.

Men and women over the age of 50 seem to think they will not be infected with the disease, researchers said, even though 10 percent of AIDS cases, including those of gay men, are diagnosed each year in that age group. The highest rate of heterosexual transmission of AIDS occurs in people over 50, they said.    The survey was conducted by Dr. Ron Stall and Dr. Joe Catania of the University of California in San Francisco and is described today in the Archives of Internal Medicine.   Younger people seem to be getting the message about ways to protect themselves against AIDS, Dr. Stall said. But for older people there has been no public health warning. \"When have you ever seen an AIDS poster with a wrinkled face?\" he said. Focus on Specific Risks    To find out what older Americans are doing to protect themselves against AIDS, the researchers culled 3,188 interviews with people over the age of 50 from large national surveys on the disease. \"We focused on heterosexuals and looked for specific risk factors,\" Dr. Stall said.   Ten percent of the men and women said they had had multiple sexual partners or a blood transfusion in the 1980's before AIDS screening was widely available, Dr. Stall said. Despite these risk factors, he said, older people were six times less likely to use condoms and five times less likely to have tests for AIDS than people in their 20's with similar risk factors.    \"We heard a lot of people say 'Thank God, this wasn't around in my day,' \" Dr. Stall said. \"But it is around in their day. It's such a horrible epidemic. It's easy to deny your own risk.\"   Doctors tend to ignore AIDS risk factors in their older patients, said Dr. Mitchell Feldman, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. \"They assume older people don't have sex and are not at risk,\" he said. \"But not only are they having sex, they are not taking precautions.\"   People over the age of 50 have consistently accounted for 10 percent of AIDS cases since the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began keeping track of the numbers. More than 33,000 people over 50 are now infected with AIDS.   Education programs about H.I.V. for older Americans are badly needed, Dr. Feldman said.  They would reduce the risk in that age group, he said, and \"trickle down\" to younger Americans who may take their own risk of contracting AIDS more seriously if they see their parents taking protective measures.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Mideast Talks: What Happened?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/opinion/mideast-talks-what-happened.html","abstract":"  The lengthening delays in the Middle East peace talks are disheartening to Israelis, Palestinians and others around the world whose hopes soared with the announcement of the historic September framework peace agreement. Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization resume talks today on the transition to Palestinian rule in Gaza and Jericho. Quick agreement is unlikely, though the first Israeli troop withdrawals are now nearly a month overdue.    Many who thrilled to the prospect of peace knew that the details would be particularly devilish because the framework left so many points intentionally vague. Still, both sides accepted the core principle of expanding Palestinian self-rule under a P.L.O. flag. How then did the atmosphere become so acrimonious, with Israel now openly challenging P.L.O.

The band members looked old and a bit out of place by New York's club standards; bald spots and button-down shirts shared the stage with an occasional tattoo. But they showed that within the confines of alternative rock, there's some space to be different.   Where some of the opening groups seemed infatuated with the idea of rock more than by rock itself, Guided by Voices actually rocked; heads bobbed a bit, and if the audience had been a touch less reserved, people might actually have danced. But Guided by Voices had something going on besides the big beat that turns a weekend night into something transcendental: it had melodies. The lead singer, Bob Pollard, singing and talking in an English accent and stumbling around as if he'd been on the receiving end of a case of beer, sang melodies that were just on the fringes of memory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940110","headline":"Order on Medicaid Abortions Surprised President","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/us/order-on-medicaid-abortions-surprised-president.html","abstract":"  The Administration's plan to require Medicaid coverage of abortions in cases of rape or incest was disclosed before anyone had told President Clinton of the order, and he was furious at its premature disclosure, Administration officials said today.

reports and charts to be shown as computer displays like color slides, or as printouts or actual slides.   Major programs feature numerous options for those who have the time and inclination to master them, but also offer quick ways to work.

This is a summary of the Windows experience.  Harvard Graphics    With Harvard Graphics 2.0 for Windows, start by selecting the New Presentation option. That leads to several steps.

Representatives from most nations have been searching feverishly in areas nearby the nine cities that will stage a monthlong tournament. It appears that only two or three have made firm commitments on their choice of training sites and housing.   United States   After games this month against Norway, Switzerland and Russia, the Americans will join three other finalists -- Bolivia, Colombia and Sweden -- in a tournament at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami Feb. 18 and 20.   The tournament will consist of a doubleheader each day, with the Americans playing Bolivia on the first day and Sweden on the second. The tournament will use the new point system adopted for the World Cup that calls for 3 points for a victory and 1 for a tie. The team with the most points wins the tournament.   Claudio Reyna, who led Virginia to its third consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association championship, has joined the World Cup team along with Frank Klopas of AEK of the Greek First Division and Dario Brose, who played in the French Second Division. He may play in Saturday's exhibition against Norway at Tempe, Ariz.   Reyna became the first player to capture the Missouri Athletic Club Sports Foundation award for the second year in a row as the outstanding player of the year. The talented midfielder from Springfield, N.J., won the coveted award yesterday with almost twice as many votes as he did last year. Through the Grapevine   Several of the 24 finalists are trying to schedule exhibition games before the tournament, which will start June 17 and end with the championship game July 17 in Los Angeles.   The United States, which will play its first-round games in Pontiac, Mich., and Pasadena, Calif., may play Greece at Giants Stadium in late May. Italy may play a non-finalist -- probably Japan -- also at Giants Stadium around the time of the United States-Greece game. Testimonial for Ukrainian   Romario of Brazil, Ronald Koeman of the Netherlands and Tom Brolin of Sweden are among several international stars who will play for a team against Sporting Lisbon in London tonight to honor Sergei Cherbakov, Sporting's injured Ukrainian star.   The 22-year-old Cherbakov is not likely to walk again after severely injuring his spine in a car crash in Lisbon on Dec. 5 following a dinner for Bobby Robson of England, Sporting's outgoing manager. FIFA Seminar   Coaches and representatives from the 24 finalists will gather in New York Feb. 22-24 for a seminar conducted by FIFA.   \"It will be a workshop type of thing,\" John Griffin, a spokesman for the United States Organizing Committee, said yesterday. \"We'll answer questions on how to do things before, during and after games.\" Ireland   About 20,000 Irish fans visiting the tournament will double as travel agents for the Emerald Isle. The fans will be given T-shirts by the Irish tourism office to promote Ireland as a holiday destination for the millions of American citizens who claim Irish ancestry and others.

Clinton (for so the President is being called on his European trip) this morning as he entered the meeting room where he and other leaders of the alliance were to discuss partnership with countries that used to be Communist, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and so on.   So he approached Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a man who carries more weight than any other European leader these days. \"I was thinking of you last night, Helmut, because I watched the sumo wrestling on television,\" the President told the puzzled Chancellor.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940111","headline":"Chess","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/11/arts/chess-835811.html","abstract":"  It is inevitable that the most distinctive weapon in a player's arsenal will usurp all the attention directed at him. If devil-may-care attacking play is his forte, his games that illustrate this will be the ones that get published. Yet some of his followers may finally begin to wonder what he does when he cannot brazenly walk a tightwire of attack.   Take Alexander Shabalov, United States co-champion for 1993. Like everybody else, the 26-year-old Pittsburgh grandmaster is bound to take his turn with the black pieces every other game in the tournament. And that means he must appear in the defender's role, despite his penchant for turbulent aggression. When he faced the California grandmaster Larry Christiansen in Round 9 of the title tourney in Long Beach, Calif., on Dec. 12, he took the opportunity to show that he defends well, too.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[{"date":"19940111","headline":"The Irish Government announces the end of a 15-year broadcasting ban on the IRA and its political arm Sinn Féin.","pages":[{"title":"Republic of Ireland","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland","description":"Country in north-western Europe","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/320px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":160},"abstract":"Ireland, also known as the Republic of Ireland, is a country in north-western Europe consisting of 26 of the 32 counties of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, on the eastern side of the island. Around 2.1 million of the country's population of 5.15 million people reside in the Greater Dublin Area. The sovereign state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, St George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the Oireachtas, consists of a lower house, Dáil Éireann; an upper house, Seanad Éireann; and an elected President who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the Taoiseach, who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers."},{"title":"Official Irish Republican Army","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Irish_Republican_Army","description":"Former Irish republican paramilitary group","thumbnail":{"thumbnail_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/OfficialIRA1972.jpg/320px-OfficialIRA1972.jpg","thumbnail_width":320,"thumbnail_height":219},"abstract":"The Official Irish Republican Army or Official IRA was an Irish republican paramilitary group whose goal was to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a \"workers' republic\" encompassing all of Ireland.
