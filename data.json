The U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond has fallen for the bogus argument that V.M.I. can stay closed to women if the state provides \"separate but substantively comparable\" military education -- 35 miles away at the all-female Mary Baldwin College.    Such evasions are unlikely to wash in the Supreme Court, which applies strict scrutiny to discriminatory treatment of the sexes. Indeed the V.M.I. case, with its evidence of determined bias and lame excuses, provides the justices an opportunity to treat gender discrimination as severely as racial discrimination. Moreover, Virginia's invocation of outdated language and doctrines should convince the justices of the need to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950203","headline":"Many Are Aboard for Buttonholing Trip","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/03/nyregion/many-are-aboard-for-buttonholing-trip.html","abstract":"  This year, New Jersey's premier business excursion was surprisingly businesslike.

She possesses an essentially fine lyric voice: secure, well-projected high notes, lustrous tone quality at lower volumes, a subtle expressive sense. In certain passages, however, she showed an uncomfortably wide vibrato and a hollowness of tone in the middle register.   This is not the most subtle role in the soprano repertory: Nedda is an unfortunate young woman caught in front of an onrushing truckload of verismo disaster. Ms. Dessi nicely sketched the innocent fantasy of \"Stridono lassu,\" but her adulterous duet with Dwayne Croft's Silvio lacked raw passion, and her acting in the play scene failed to get across the character's slow realization of her fate. She hasn't yet found the big, obvious gestures needed to make an impact on the Met stage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950203","headline":"1895: Anarchist Threat : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/03/opinion/IHT-1895-anarchist-threat-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - Appearances seem to indicate that the wretched anarchists are again trying to bring themselves to notice.

Lloyd Richards, Mr. Wilson's longtime collaborator, is once again the director, and Charles Dutton returns to the role of Boy Willie in a mesmerizingly powerful performance.    On the face of it, \"The Piano Lesson\" is an uncomplicated story. Boisterous Boy Willie and his gentle pal Lymon (Courtney B.

New Jersey's second-highest court ruled today that taxpayers can sue their assessors and their municipalities under the Federal Civil Rights Act. And they can collect compensatory and punitive damages, plus their legal fees, if they can prove the assessor acted out of malice or prejudice in setting an unfairly high assessment on their property.    The ruling involves a lawsuit filed by General Motors over the tax assessment on its auto assembly plant in Linden. In 1986, the company saw its assessment rise dramatically in what company officials said was retaliation for past appeals, prompting them to file the suit.    A lower court ruled that, under state law, an assessor enjoys absolute immunity from lawsuits. The lower court further said that it lacked jurisdiction and that the matter should be handled by the state's tax court.    A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court today overturned the lower court's ruling on both counts and sent the case back for more hearings. It also agreed that General Motors could press a claim for violation of its constitutional rights under the Federal 1871 Civil Rights Act if it can prove the Linden tax assessor and other city officials were trying to punish the automotive giant for prior tax appeals.    \"This is a very, very significant decision that provides an additional arrow for taxpayers fighting unfair assessments,\" said John E. Garippa, a lawyer for General Motors. \"In rare instances where an assessing official acts so egregiously outside the bounds of propriety in setting assessments that it appears to be retaliatory, you can now allege a civil rights violation for that act, no matter whether you're an individual or a major corporation.\"    While the appeals panel said that assessors did not enjoy absolute immunity from lawsuits, it nevertheless recognized a qualified immunity that protects assessors from lawsuits for honest mistakes.    The 23-page ruling written by Judge Stephen Skillman recognized that allowing civil rights lawsuits may have a \"chilling effect\" on a tax assessor's performance and may be \"disruptive of a state tax system.\" But the court held that \"these dangers are not a sufficient basis\" to bar legal action based on the Civil Rights Act \"to a party whose constitutional rights have been violated.\" Judges Thomas F. Shebell Jr. and Steven Z. Kleiner joined in the opinion.    \"If we were to hold that a civil rights action is not maintainable in the law division solely because an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights relates to a tax assessment, it would mean that a tax assessor could engage in a practice of racially discriminatory tax assessments without being subject to personal liability under the Civil Rights Act.    \"Since prevention of racial discrimination by state officials was the essential reason for the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, we are unwilling to read a limitation into the scope of its operation which would prevent a state court from granting complete relief, including compensatory and punitive damages, for such a violation of constitutional rights.\"    The appeals court pointed to other state and Federal court opinions that have held that tax officials can be liable for damages if they \"intentionally and unjustifiably\" raise an individual's property tax assessment \"merely because of the individual's race, ethnic background or political affiliation.\"    In 1985, General Motors built an addition to its Linden plant that cost $5 million, Mr. Garippa said. He said the municipal tax assessment on the plant increased by $30 million. \"That's a 600 percent increase and that's what led to the filing of court papers alleging the new assessment was in retaliation for prior tax appeals,\" he said.    Telephone calls requesting an interview with Donald P. Jacobs, the lawyer for Linden, and Mr. Frangella, the tax assessor, were not returned.     Because the ruling was unanimous, there is no automatic right of appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court. But the defendants can petition the state's highest court for certification while the lower trial court conducts its hearing on the tax appeal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950204","headline":"Ewing Keeps Focus Firmly On the Sixers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/04/sports/basketball-ewing-keeps-focus-firmly-on-the-sixers.html","abstract":"  The temptation was to look ahead, but Patrick Ewing understands as well as anyone the perils of compromising the future by ignoring the present.

Ms. Erickson's voice was a mix of astonishment and dismay as she reflected on the Governor's plans to eviscerate the Home Relief program and to roll back other welfare benefits, including aid to the elderly, the blind and the disabled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950204","headline":"Witnesses Recall Terror of L.I.R.R.

Mr. Gingrich recognized that inevitability when he abandoned any idea of abolishing the House Ethics Committee. Instead he opted for a holdover group of five Republicans and five Democrats who had served on the committee before he became Speaker. The move was designed to avoid the conflict of interest that would have resulted if Mr. Gingrich had helped appoint a new committee to rule on the ethics complaint filed against him by his opponent in the last election, Ben Jones.   That complaint raises the accusation that tax-deductible contributions to a foundation linked to Mr. Gingrich were improperly used to finance a politically oriented course he taught at a Georgia college. The complaint asserts that his use of his House employees to help with the course violated House rules. It was recently amended to include aspects of Mr. Gingrich's book deal with a publishing house owned by Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Gingrich, having rejected the sound advice of some Republicans to cancel a deal that has undermined public confidence in his leadership, plans to submit his contract to the committee.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950204","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/04/sports/results-plus-303195.html","abstract":"  N.B.A.  Magic Loses Its Second Straight Game  Rik Smits had 27 points last night as the host Indiana Pacers dealt the Orlando Magic its second straight loss, 118-106.

Very few people live in a mode of real comedy; they laugh a lot but their lives are not comic. Comedy is almost as cruel and exclusive as tragedy. Most of us live in a world of melodrama, a world of mingled laughter and tears, gain and deprivation and excitement -- the hurly-burly of normal life.\"   Taking off from a poem by Henrik Ibsen, he believes that \"a man's self-judgment\" is \"the conscience of a writer.\" Through a process of self-analysis that has been both painful and joyous, his life has provided him with the raw material for what he writes. Interwoven, with overlapping characters, his 11 novels can be regarded as a kind of masked autobiography. The books often begin in Canadian villages as small as his birthplace of Thamesville in southwest Ontario, but they soon open up to reveal allegorical allusions and magical transformations. Accidental incidents can have endless effects, and behind everything is the immutability of the human heart. A misaimed snowball in his 1970 novel \"Fifth Business,\" for example, sets off a chain of events. It becomes a defining moment, touching scores of lives and a trilogy of novels. In the case of his new novel, \"The Cunning Man,\" there are medical and spiritual mysteries.

Part of the pleasure comes from knowing that the prime midtown Manhattan location will make it possible for a large and diverse audience to see this extravagantly gifted architect's designs. In addition, a great metropolitan transportation hub provides Ms. Hadid's work with an ideal setting. Like Erich Mendelsohn, the early-20th-century German Expressionist, Ms. Hadid designs buildings that powerfully convey a sense of dynamic movement. To see them here, in America's finest temple to civilized circulation, is to gain a deeper sense of their historical and urban dimension.   Ms. Hadid, who is 43 and lives in London, was first introduced to New York audiences in 1988 at the Museum of Modern Art's show \"Deconstructivist Architecture,\" where she was represented by her design for the Peak athletic club in Hong Kong. Two years ago, she created the superb exhibition design for \"The Great Utopia,\" the Guggenheim's monumental survey of the Russian avant-garde. \"Zaha Hadid: Projects,\" which is on view this month in the terminal's main waiting room, allows the Iraqi-born architect to shine on her own.

Manufacturers like L. L. Bean, Timberland and North Face turn Polartec into outerwear for everything from skiing and kayaking to walking the dog. ALIASES: Whether it's called Polarfleece, Polarplus, Polarlite (all Malden trademarks) or Synchilla (Patagonia's version), it's basically the same thing: knitted polyester occasionally mixed with materials like Lycra or nylon to make it more form-fitting. BEYOND THE GREAT OUTDOORS: Henri Bendel started selling a private-label Polartec shirt with pinked edges ($98) last June. Now, the store is making Polartec cardigans, vests, A-line skirts, baseball jackets and leggings in 18 fashion colors like sage, maize and cappuccino. Nicole Miller's fall collection featured Polartec skirts, dresses and twin sets, and J. Crew recently added a Polartec bathrobe ($78) to its catalogue. THE ATHLETES' CASE FOR POLARTEC: The fabric -- Malden makes it in 100 varieties and nearly 5,000 colors, prints and patterns -- is lightweight but extremely warm, and it dries quickly; garments meant to be worn next to the skin have anti-microbial properties, meaning they are hypoallergenic and resist mildew. And unlike wool or cashmere, Polartec can be thrown into the washing machine. The labels even say, \"Do not dry clean.\" Malden Mills, which is privately owned, said Polartec's popularity had caused the company to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent for the last decade. Last year, the company had worldwide sales of $400 million. THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS' CASE FOR POLARTEC: Since 1993, Malden has been offering its Recycled Series -- Polartec made in part from recycled clear plastic soda bottles. About 15 large bottles are used per jacket. Malden estimates that it will use more than eight million pounds of recycled plastic this year (about 140 million bottles).  GROUNDS FOR APPEAL: \"Customers have reacted viscerally to the feel of this fabric -- it's warm, cuddly and plush,\" said Gail Goldberg, a divisional merchandise manager at Bendel's. \"It's the Rolls-Royce of fleece fabrications.\" FIRST EXPERT WITNESS: \"I live in a Polartec cocoon,\" said Sandy Pittman, the New York socialite, who has climbed the tallest peaks on all five continents and has traveled to both the North and South Poles. \"I was one of the last converts to it, because I tend to be a traditionalist. But after a soggy trip to the Arctic in wool knickers, I became a man-made-fiber gal.\"    Ms. Pittman can't get enough of the stuff. \"I saw those great pieces at Bendel's and bought one of everything!\" she said. \"I don't need to wear my technical pieces with gusseted arms and high-altitude zips while sitting in my New York apartment.\" SECOND EXPERT WITNESS: \"I just wore one of my dresses to go ice skating,\" Nicole Miller said. \"It's the greatest fabric. It's more comfortable and versatile than wool. It's putting the ski-sweater business out of business. I feel the possibilities for it are unlimited. I'm thinking of making little suits out of it to wear to the office.\" THIRD EXPERT WITNESS: \"I have a piece in every closet in my house,\" said Joan Alvarez, publisher and editorial director of Outdoor Retailer, a trade magazine. \"Anything that you can make out of fleece makes sense, whether for your head, hands or body.\" A SMALL DISSENT: \"Personally, I wouldn't wear a dress made out of it,\" continued Ms. Alvarez, who likes to wear a fleece sweater over her nightgown for early morning gardening. \"If you're talking about a garment that will add a half an inch to your butt, well, not a lot of women would like that.\" DAN SHAW","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"LONG ISLAND GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/nyregion/long-island-guide.html","abstract":"FREE CHOICES\n\n TODAY The Islip Arts Council Sunday series moves to Fortunoff Hall at Dowling College in Oakdale with a violinist, Cornelia Schwartz, and a pianist, Frank Corliss, performing music by Dvorak, Ravel and Stravinsky.

It is a small work, all but overwhelmed by a gold frame that is its equal in area -- perhaps larger. There are many such frames in the show and, as usual, they prove that ornament designed to separate art from a busy 19th-century context becomes an irritating distraction when used in a simple contemporary setting.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"Westchester Q&A;: Lawrence E.

The architecture enclosed the picture, so frames were not necessary. In the 14th century, as artists started to paint on panels and canvas, they recognized the need to frame their works. Framing became an art in itself, and framers often created pieces so ornate that they overpowered the picture. With the rise of modernism, artists demanded simpler, less distracting frames. Even so, framing is still an art that requires craftsmanship and good taste.\n\nPicture frames have two functions. One is esthetic. A good frame directs the viewer's eye to the art work, and it creates a boundary that separates the picture from the visual distractions of the surrounding environment. The second function is more prosaic but no less important. The frame protects the art work from dust and humidity and guards it from damage when the piece is handled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/books/in-short-nonfiction.html","abstract":"WOODY ALLEN \nON WOODY ALLEN \nBy Stig Bjorkman.\nGrove, $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"Q and A","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/travel/q-and-a-096595.html","abstract":"  Passover in Hawaii   Q.

The three Metro-North passenger lines that serve different parts of the county -- the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven Lines -- all run north to south.

All this may change if Metro-North's plans for the future come to fruition. Two major east-to-west linkages are being considered, all with the intention of changing commuting patterns in and out of the county. Metro-North recently announced the purchase of a rarely used freight line in Dutchess and Putnam Counties, which for the first time would connect all three passenger lines. Further, Metro-North is engaged in a long-term study of the feasibility of offering service to Rockland County on the west side of the Hudson River, and one plan would put that rail service alongside Interstate 287.

The architecture enclosed the picture, so frames were not necessary. In the 14th century, as artists started to paint on panels and canvas, they recognized the need to frame their works. Framing became an art in itself, and framers often created pieces so ornate that they overpowered the picture. With the rise of modernism, artists demanded simpler, less distracting frames. Even so, framing is still an art that requires craftsmanship and good taste.\n\nPicture frames have two functions. One is esthetic. A good frame directs the viewer's eye to the art work, and it creates a boundary that separates the picture from the visual distractions of the surrounding environment. The second function is more prosaic but no less important. The frame protects the art work from dust and humidity and guards it from damage when the piece is handled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"The Fickle Feather of Fate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/books/the-fickle-feather-of-fate.html","abstract":"VURT\nBy Jeff Noon.\n342 pp. New York:\nCrown Publishers. $22.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"SOAPBOX;\nA Visit With a Stranger","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/nyregion/soapbox-a-visit-with-a-stranger.html","abstract":"ON THE last day of 1994 I visited a man named Al who is a patient at St. Clare's Hospital on West 52d Street.

Lanford Wilson bathed the courtship tale of \"two such private people, so much alike\" with an appreciation of natural wonder that evokes the woods and the willows, the river and the fragrance of honeysuckle and the sound of crickets -- and a lyric grace that invited comparisons to the delicate poetic flights of early Tennessee Williams.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"On Implants","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/sports/l-on-implants-176095.html","abstract":"  To the Sports Editor:   I am pleased to see that the effectiveness of cochlear implant surgery has advanced enough to be accepted by such a high-profile figure as Gil McDougald and that it has improved McDougald's life enough to be written about with such feelings by Ira Berkow (\"The Sweetest Sound of All,\" The Times, Jan. 4).

The architecture enclosed the picture, so frames were not necessary. In the 14th century, as artists started to paint on panels and canvas, they recognized the need to frame their works. Framing became an art in itself, and framers often created pieces so ornate that they overpowered the picture. With the rise of modernism, artists demanded simpler, less distracting frames. Even so, framing is still an art that requires craftsmanship and good taste.\n\nPicture frames have two functions. One is esthetic. A good frame directs the viewer's eye to the art work, and it creates a boundary that separates the picture from the visual distractions of the surrounding environment. The second function is more prosaic but no less important. The frame protects the art work from dust and humidity and guards it from damage when the piece is handled.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"To the Mountaintop and Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/arts/music/to-the-mountaintop-and-back.html","abstract":"WHEN THE performance artist Laurie Anderson set out on a hiking trip through the Himalayas two summers ago, she had no inkling how profoundly the experience would affect her work. \"I hadn't been in a crazy place for a while and wanted to go on an adventure,\" she says, explaining her journey.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"2,009 Reasons to Play, but One Not To","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/sports/2009-reasons-to-play-but-one-not-to.html","abstract":"  The closer major league baseball comes to perhaps its most divisive and troubled spring training ever, the closer it comes to pitting its 750 striking major league players against those who would seek to replace them.

In that respect, the Mayor's emergency plan, announced Thursday, was disappointing.

Richard Strauss's laid-back approach to conducting is a familiar bit of musical lore, and it shows up again in the recently released Teldec video \"The Art of Conducting,\" a mesmerizing although occasionally misleading audiovisual history of great conductors from Arthur Nikisch to Leonard Bernstein. In a filmed appearance with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1944, Strauss traces idle curlicues in the air, exuding diffidence from every pore. He casts a couple of mordant glances at the horn section but otherwise seems completely disengaged from the performance of \"Till Eulenspiegel\" unfolding before him.   This footage is used to illustrate a sardonic commentary by George Szell, Strauss's former assistant in Berlin, who tells that the maestro glanced at his watch during performances and hurried tempos in anticipation of the postconcert card game. True to form, Strauss is shown imposing a sneaky accelerando. The trouble with this picture is the sound; the orchestra plays with frantic intensity, pouncing on every phrase. Between the saturnine old man and the raging orchestra, something is communicated that the camera cannot hope to capture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950205","headline":"Sleep Disorders And Lyme Disease","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/nyregion/l-sleep-disorders-and-lyme-disease-106295.html","abstract":"  As a former sufferer of chronic sleep disorder, I read with great interest the article \"Sleep Disorders and Sleep Centers Are on the Rise\" (Jan. 15).

Aficionados can spot it by its syncopation and rhythmic complexity, with the rhythm articulated by the entire body.
