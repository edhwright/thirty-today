Not too many, mind you, and hardly any at all in those made-for-television movies on commercial networks beholden to advertisers. So it's hardly surprising that \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" a factual account of the takeover madness of the 1980's, has been made for sponsor-free pay cable. The flawed but fascinating production, starring James Garner, has its premiere on HBO on Saturday at 8 P.M.   Based on the exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, best seller by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, \"Barbarians at the Gate\" chronicles the multi-billion-dollar battle in 1988 for RJR Nabisco, which at the time was working feverishly on developing a \"smokeless cigarette.\" The machinations were incredibly complex, requiring bankers galore and backfield lawyers for the lawyers on the front lines. Condensing the story into a movie running less than two hours, Larry Gelbart, the creator of television's \"M*A*S*H,\" has eliminated the players in the middle layers to focus almost entirely on the top-level principals, most notably F. Ross Johnson, chairman of RJR Nabisco, and Henry Kravis, the master of leveraged buyouts at the Wall Street concern Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Sense of Family Helped Jury in Sex-Assault Case","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/nyregion/sense-of-family-helped-jury-in-sex-assault-case.html","abstract":"  Most days Donald Murray brightened the jury room with a stream of jokes.

On Nov. 14, three jurors had birthdays and they all celebrated with cakes, fresh fruits and cold cuts around the long rectangular table in the sparse, biege jury room.   This triple birthday celebration, one month into the trial, was a large first step in the transformation of jury into family, some of the Glen Ridge jurors recalled today. Daily, as a trial predicted to last six weeks stretched into five months, they said they worked to include everyone in common activities and to cultivate an atmosphere of unity and belonging.

Through March 20 WITH: Christopher Bailey, Julia McLaughlin,  Michael Curran, Bill Christ, Barbara Berque and Michelle Berke.  Jarret (Christopher Bailey), the central character in Thomas Hinton's comedy \"The Best of Sex and Violence,\" is a sour milquetoast of uncertain sexual orientation who teaches medieval history at a Connecticut college. In the course of a single evening, he is visited by his ex-wife, Karen (Barbara Berque), by his quarreling neighbors, Marion (Julia McLaughlin) and Randell (Bill Christ), and by the neighbors' 20-year-old son, Robert (Michael Curran), who wants to live with Jarret as his lover.    The play aspires to be a latter-day drawing room comedy descended from Oscar Wilde through Noel Coward to Harvey Fierstein. The dialogue is nonstop pronouncements trying desperately to be epigrams but ending up merely hysterical. Among these one-dimensional mouthpieces for varying sexual attitudes, the most outspoken is Randell, the chauvinistic coach for the college debating team, who declares, \"I want to be buried in a sea of women I made pregnant.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Lilco's Emissions Sale Spurs Acid Rain Concerns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/nyregion/lilco-s-emissions-sale-spurs-acid-rain-concerns.html","abstract":"  The Long Island Lighting Company wants to sell the right to emit pollution to a fuel supplier that would resell the pollution rights to any of a dozen utilities scattered around the Midwest, South and West, according to documents made public yesterday and people involved in the deal.

James Woolsey, President Clinton's chief spymaster, seems well on his way to becoming a captive of the old-boy bookkeepers in the intelligence agencies. Mr. Clinton, who needs to save every dollar he can, would be a sucker to let that happen.    The immediate issue is the annual intelligence budget of $29 billion. The larger issue is whether America needs an intelligence apparatus of cold war dimensions. Mr. Woolsey told the House Intelligence Committee that he could absorb a $1 billion cut in next year's budget but not much more -- a snub of Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to find $7.5 billion in cuts over five years.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Review/Music; A '58 Opera That Tested Mildly Dissonant Tonality","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/arts/review-music-a-58-opera-that-tested-mildly-dissonant-tonality.html","abstract":"  The search goes on for an American operatic tradition. True to its habit of reviving one American opera each year, the Boston Lyric Opera has staged Carlisle Floyd's \"Wuthering Heights,\" which appeared to great acclaim in 1958 and then more or less dropped from sight. The company devoted considerable talent and energy to the production, which had its premiere on March 10 at the Emerson Majestic Theater here, but the opera's obscurity unfortunately proved to be deserved.   In the 1940's and 50's, as America basked in its postwar dominance, many composers were determined to construct a native school of grand opera. Mr. Floyd had scored a huge success with his tuneful \"Susannah,\" and for his first serious opera he turned to a certified Great Classic. In flirting with \"advanced\" musical language, he ventured no further than the angular lines common in film scores of the period and also the dissonant tonality of Puccini's \"Turandot.\" The aim was to be serious yet entirely accessible.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930318","headline":"Foundation for Press Is Subject of Inquiry By New York State","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/18/nyregion/foundation-for-press-is-subject-of-inquiry-by-new-york-state.html","abstract":"  The New York State Attorney General's office is investigating the spending practices of a charitable organization that promotes free-speech issues and is headed by Allen H.

Modern scholars believe it was a transitional period between winter and summer whose beginning was marked by cool, windy weather bearing the seductive hint of warm, ripe days to come. Days were apparently mild and balmy, evenings cool and fragrant with the aroma of a thousand blossoming trees and flowers.   The spring experienced by our remote ancestors bears nothing in common, needless to say, with the cruel tease that New Yorkers know today, a 10-day jolt of slashing rain that follows six weeks of meat-locker temperatures and howling Arctic winds, and raises the curtain on four months of blistering heat and 90 percent humidity. Spring in New York is a hoax. The city staggers into it like a man with a \"kick me\" sign tacked to his rear end. Chicago is spared this debacle, because it has no hope.

That original format has been subverted by policy turmoils within the Y and survives only in altered form. Yet if Mr. Schiff's first concert, played before a packed house on a snow-blown Wednesday night, is an indication, this 18-sonata cycle surrounded by symposiums, master classes and film offerings, has found in defeat an unexpected triumph of its own.   Halfway through the evening, one felt the wisdom of, indeed a necessity for, placing these pieces side by side and separating them from the music of others.

Frank Baum's classic, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" it is an ebullient family crowd-pleaser. And a new production at the Beacon Theater, directed by George Faison and starring Stephanie Mills and Andre De Shields from the original Broadway cast, demonstrates that it doesn't take much to refresh the show, which ran on Broadway for four years. All that's needed is an infusion of contemporary slang and choreography (including a little Michael Jackson moonwalking and sexy L. L. Cool J-style pushups) to bring it up to date.   \"The Wiz\" takes a story so familiar that it doesn't have to be meticulously told to be followed, and reconceives it as a modern vaudeville entertainment with a pop-gospel score. The show is much jollier in tone than the movie \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which conveyed deep currents of Depression-era anxiety and longing for better times. Stephanie Mills's Dorothy has more pluck and brass than Judy Garland's waifish prairie dreamer. And while Ms. Mills's traveling companions on the Yellow Brick Road bemoan their lack of brains, heart and courage, the show's Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are not so poignantly bereft of self-confidence as their movie counterparts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Films From New Directors Taking Literary License","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/movies/films-from-new-directors-taking-literary-license.html","abstract":"  The New Directors/New Films series has existed for 22 years, but it has rarely if ever led off with the literary one-two punch of tonight's opening programs, \"Orlando\" and \"The Music of Chance.\"   Both films are adapted from the kind of serious novel that Hollywood has traditionally shunned as hopelessly highbrow and uncommercial. \"Orlando,\" the debut of Sally Potter, a 43-year-old English choregrapher turned director, is a cinematic realization of Virginia Woolf's classic 1928 novel. \"The Music of Chance,\" the first fictional feature by the documentary film maker Philip Haas, is an adaptation of a highly regarded metaphysical suspense novel, published in 1990 by the Brooklyn-based author Paul Auster.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Stop Wasting Aid to Russia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/opinion/stop-wasting-aid-to-russia.html","abstract":"The world now looks toward Moscow with increasing trepidation.

Daniels, would be leaving the organization when his contract expires in June.   A statement released by the theater said Mr. Daniels, who has been the managerial and administrative head of Playwrights Horizons since 1981, was leaving \"to pursue other opportunities.\"   Neither Mr. Daniels nor the chairman of the board of trustees, Judith O. Rubin, returned phone messages this week. But the artistic director of Playwrights, Don Scardino, said in a careful phone interview that the move signaled a shakeup in the organization's two-pronged management structure. It was a year ago that Mr. Scardino, an actor and director in theater and film, replaced Andre Bishop, who had moved on to become artistic director at Lincoln Center Theater. Together, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Daniels had established a leadership team that apparently foundered after Mr. Bishop's departure. (Mr. Bishop, who remains a member of the Playwrights board, declined to comment on the matter, pleading awkwardness.)   Mr. Scardino said the search for Mr. Daniels's replacement had begun, but he added that two people might be hired: an executive director with fund-raising responsibility and a company manager whose bailiwick would be the administrative end of the theater's stage productions.    \"One of the things in question is whether the two-headed team is the best structure for us or not,\" Mr. Scardino said. \"I'm very much a group person. I'm a director who comes out of the rehearsal hall. I like a group dynamic and I'm not insecure about having someone disagree with me. One of the reasons I want to investigate the triumvirate is that you always have a tiebreaker.\"   It was already a somewhat tumultuous year at Playwrights Horizons, a 22-year-old group with two small theaters on West 42d Street that is dedicated to the development of new American plays and musicals. Mr. Scardino brought in a new associate artistic director, Nicholas Martin; as head of the board, Ms. Rubin is a recent replacement for Anne G. Wilder, who died in September.    Mr. Scardino's first year has been without any successes equal to the many renowned projects that have been born there in the past, including \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" and \"Sunday in the Park With George.\" It is, of course, early in his tenure, and he said the dismissal of JoAnne Akalaitis by the New York Shakespeare Festival board after only 20 months was baffling and troubling. \"She's not Joe Papp, and I'm not Andre Bishop,\" he said. \"How many years did it take for them to establish their identities?\"   In considering Mr. Daniels's departure, his own board, he said, had \"decided to let it happen and go with the art.\" He said he did not find the Shakespeare Festival situation comparable to that at Playwrights Horizons because \"one was about artistic change, and the other is about managerial change.\"   Asked if he and Mr. Daniels had clashed, Mr. Scardino said: \"There's a different sensibility guiding the company,\" and compared himself to a person who inherits someone else's wardrobe. \"This color was good for him,\" he said. \"This length was good for him. I'll wear it for a while, but eventually I've got to take it in. I like the suit, but I want it in blue.\" Speak No Evil    Unable to save \"Face Value,\" the producers simply saved face by declining to speak with reporters this week. (A man sounding a lot like Stuart Ostrow answered the phone at Mr. Ostrow's home, saying \"He'll have to get back to you\" and hanging up without waiting for the number.) David Henry Hwang's play about confused racial identities, which closed Sunday after a critically bruising tryout in Boston and eight previews at the Cort Theater, apparently never overcame a perception that the show was trying to do too much and ended up doing too little. Reviewers (and a sampling of the few other people who saw it) tended to say they couldn't tell if the show was a farce that wasn't funny or a serious play with too many goofy jokes.   Indeed, one source who was aware of the play's problems in Boston said that Rocco Landesman, a co-producer and president of Jujamcyn Theaters, had tried to persuade his colleagues, Mr. Ostrow and Scott Rudin, to close the show before it got here. Mr. Rudin and Mr. Ostrow said at the time, however, that they were undaunted, buoyed by the knowledge that Mr. Hwang's previous play, \"M. Butterfly,\" which became a Tony-winning hit, was also clobbered out of town. And Mr. Hwang (who, through the show's publicity agent, also declined to be interviewed) spent his days rewriting furiously, with the play changing nightly. One viewer who saw it in both cities said: \"In Boston, the first act was funny, and the second act was too serious.\" In New York, he added, they tried to prepare the audience for what was going to happen in the second act, and as a result the first act wasn't funny anymore.   From the point of view of a reporter who didn't see the play at all, the person who comes out of this best is the star, Mark Linn Baker. Mr. Baker, now an out-of-work actor possessed, apparently, of comic humility, donned a waiter's apron to introduce himself during one lunch hour at the West Bank Cafe on 42d Street this week. (It turns out he's part owner of the place.)   \"My understanding is they just ran out of money,\" Mr. Baker said. \"It was such an ambitious play. We knew before we started in Boston we had a lot of work to do.\"   He said there had been a celebratory wake, of sorts, for the show on Tuesday night at Wally and Joseph's, the steakhouse on West 49th Street. But he hadn't had a steak.   \"I was drinking kamikazes,\" he said. An 'Arf' for Off Broadway?    The corpse is twitching, though as Charles Strouse would rather put it, \"the body is breathing.\" Mr. Strouse, who wrote the music for the apparently ill-fated and moribund sequel \"Annie Warbucks,\" confirmed this week that many producers had come forward with an interest in resuscitating the show, the scheduled Broadway production of which was, pardon the expression, orphaned when it was shut down three weeks ago.   \"There are people who know there is money to be made on this,\" Mr. Strouse said. \"Even the stingiest investor knows there was profit of $300 million on 'Annie.' \"   Interestingly enough, among the offers is one to present the show Off Broadway. Though he refuses to acknowledge it publicly, Ben Sprecher, who operates the Variety Arts theater on Third Avenue and 14th Street, has been approaching investors with a proposal to open the show there. The Variety Arts, a 499-seat venue, is Off Broadway's most capacious theater.   \"I've been approached to produce 'Annie Warbucks' Off-Broadway,\" said Kenneth D. Greenblatt (\"Catskills on Broadway\"), adding it was Mr. Sprecher who did the approaching. \"It's under consideration. I like the project. Creatively I think it's wonderful. I'm just concerned about doing it Off Broadway for financial reasons.\"   Mr. Strouse said he'd definitely be interested. \"A way to get into the New York marketplace is something I want very much,\" he said.   Mr. Sprecher, when asked about his plans, said, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Review/Film Festival; In a Weird City, Games Turn Serious","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/movies/review-film-festival-in-a-weird-city-games-turn-serious.html","abstract":"Beckett-like fable of bizarre plaything, two drifters and fate.

Having presided over some 50 misdemeanor trials in the Bronx and Manhattan over the last three years, I take issue with Eliot Spitzer's contention (Op-Ed, March 1) that jury selection significantly contributes to trial delays and to case backlogs.    Like most judges, I do the initial questioning of prospective jurors and then permit the lawyers 10 or 15 minutes to do their own questioning. The Court of Appeals has approved such judicial control of jury selection, and it is codified in court rules. When this practice is followed, rarely does jury selection take two hours, much less two days, as Mr. Spitzer states.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Article 270893 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/arts/article-270893-no-title.html","abstract":"  For many New Yorkers, Eastern European and Russian dishes are powerful aids to memory.

You can see the memories in the eyes of many patrons of Cafe Andrusha, a tiny, 34-seat, three-year-old spot set among a clutch of inexpensive restaurants and bars on the Upper East Side. \"In the beginning, we had big crowds talking family business constantly, talking about mothers, grandmothers,\" said Liana Kirkwood, the owner, whose Scottish surname belies her Czech-Russian heritage.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930319","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/19/us/c-corrections-358593.html","abstract":"  An article on Saturday about the explosion at the World Trade Center misstated the birthplace of one arrested suspect in some copies.
