Two other steel companies, which have labor contracts that also expired late yesterday, did not seem prepared to meet the same terms. Armco Inc., based in Parsippany, N.J., persuaded the union to continue working under the old contract until talks resume on Aug. 12; the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, based in Bethlehem, Pa., was studying whether to begin shutting down the huge blast furnaces that need to be stopped before production halts.   Roughly 17,300 employees of Bethlehem are affected by the current round of talks, as are 2,200 at Armco. 'Steady Progress'    \"We've made steady progress on the issues and are still hopeful we'll achieve an agreement prior to the midnight deadline,\" said Henry Von Spreckelsen, a spokesman for Bethlehem.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930801","headline":"DINING OUT;\nA Seafood Menu With Unusual Dishes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/nyregion/dining-out-a-seafood-menu-with-unusual-dishes.html","abstract":"THE restaurant on the side of Route 34 South opposite Delicious Orchards in the Monmouth County community of Colts Neck has been through enough changes in ownership and type of food to make the head spin. \n\nIt began life about 10 years ago as an elegant English-style country restaurant called the Fox and Hounds, with dark paneled walls, crisp damask tablecloths and waiters in black tie.

Occasionally, however, someone will notice the sign, be intrigued by it, and turn into the road, to discover a place that appears to be rooted forever in the 19th century. At the spot, under huge shade trees, are little wooden houses, perched this way and that around a circular road that had been made just wide enough to accommodate horses and buggies going one way. Nearly all of the houses have front porches, for sitting and talking on a warm summer evening. There is also a preacher's stand for outdoor religious services, a dining hall, a chapel, a library.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Sara Waring, Taegan Goddard","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/style/weddings-sara-waring-taegan-goddard.html","abstract":"  Sara Mercedes Waring, a research assistant at the World Bank, and Taegan Daniel Goddard, a policy analyst for the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, both in Washington, were married in Woodstock, Vt., yesterday.

Critics complain that the series lacks breadth and emphasizes some parts of jazz history at the expense of others. They also say the programs are insular, with the artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, and some of his current and former band members regularly receiving commissions (Mr. Marsalis has gotten one every year) and performing in more than their fair share of the concerts. Inclusion also means exclusion, and virtually every member of the jazz community has ideas about who should be represented but isn't.   There is truth to most of the criticism, and in general the program has been guilty of an astounding clumsiness when it comes to the appearance of impropriety. The series has not once featured a white composer, opening itself up to charges of racism. In May its director, Rob Gibson, fired members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra because they were over 30, only to rescind the dismissals after being apprised of the illegality of the move. The series has also ignored the jazz avant-garde of the 1960's and 1970's.

True, music of the medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods abounds in churches and small halls around New York. But the term Early Music has come to mean more: not only an ancient body of works but an esthetic of performance. Over the last decade, the ethic of period performance practice, originally meant to recreate the long-lost sonorities and styles of genuinely early repertories, has been extended boldly through the 19th century and tentatively into the 20th.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Computer Thieves Hit The Campus","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/education/blackboard-computer-thieves-hit-the-campus.html","abstract":"  A WAVE of computer thefts has hit the nation's college campuses and is interfering significantly with student work.    \"There has been an upswing in the last few months at the larger public computing facilities nationwide,\" said Douglas Van Houweling, vice provost for information technology at the University of Michigan. \"Toward the end of a semester a student needs the computers and it becomes a major problem when we lose them due to criminal activity.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Symbols of Summer and Bits of Whimsy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/nyregion/crafts-symbols-of-summer-and-bits-of-whimsy.html","abstract":"  THE New Jersey Designer Craftsmen must have worked hard to create symbols of the lazy days of summer.

Let William J. Caunitz put a focus on those woozy feelings of dread. If you buy the harrowing premise of this former New York police lieutenant's smartly researched thriller CLEOPATRA GOLD (Crown, $20), Latin American drug cartels are indeed taking over the country, and they are infinitely more cunning and ruthless than the candy man on the corner. The big dopers Mr. Caunitz writes about use the most sophisticated weapons and communications systems and the latest aerodynamics technology to transport their huge heroin cargos from Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle to New York. And when these guys get testy, they feed their enemies to giant anacondas -- right on the stage of a Manhattan movie theater at 112th and Madison. (O.K., so maybe there's a bit of invention at play here.)   The only hope, it seems, is Alejandro Monahan, a half-Irish, half-Tarascan Mexican nightclub crooner who has infiltrated the Cleopatra network, working as the deepest kind of undercover agent for our side. Alejandro has terrific style, as do the obscenely colorful traficantes.

A vibrant city that exhilarates without exhausting, Denver has plenty of elbow room, geographically and intellectually.

These performances, by Wilhelm Furtwangler, Erich Kleiber, Willem Mengelberg, Georg Kulenkampff, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and Eugen Jochum, represent the inverse image of \"Entartete Musik,\" the series London is currently releasing.

Marion Boyars, $24.95. The final novel in the Danish writer Henrik Stangerup's trilogy of European historical fiction, \"Brother Jacob\" may be his best and most profound. Though studded with bloody episodes of the primitive, as befits its 16th-century setting, the drama, as energetically translated by Anne Born, turns on the commitments and renunciations of men and women for whom philosophy equals destiny. The title character, a member of the Danish royal family, joins the Franciscans just as Renaissance turns to Reformation. When he flees his suddenly Protestant homeland, Jacob's refugee existence becomes a search for utopia, a quest that steers him into quandaries of spirit evoked through nightmare physicality, often suggesting his tormented countryman Hamlet. At its most sublime, Mr. Stangerup's novel reconnects artistic integrity with its religious roots.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"A New Russian Empire?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/opinion/a-new-russian-empire.html","abstract":"  Two years ago, Moscow lost an empire, stranding 25 million ethnic Russians in newly independent republics.

But the last time I saw it, the sober film had acquired surprising moments of hilarity. When the heroine settled down to dinner with her fellow doctors, instead of Ingrid Bergman, Leo G. Carroll and Gregory Peck, all I could see was Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman and Mel Brooks as the staff of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very Very Nervous. This was the effect of having watched Mr. Brooks's loving Hitchcock parody, \"High Anxiety,\" a few weeks before. When a movie satire works, the original may never look the same again.    Over the years, no one has spoofed movies better than Mr. Brooks. \"Blazing Saddles,\" \"Young Frankenstein\" and \"High Anxiety,\" his 1970's classics, have spawned a mini-industry of imitators: the goofy \"Airplane!\" and \"Naked Gun\" series; the howlingly comic \"Hot Shots!\" and its current, lesser sequel, \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\"; the lame, optimistically titled \"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1,\" which came and went quickly last winter. The best Brooks movies have become so familiar, the clones so plentiful and the audience so jaded that his new film, \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights,\" puts him in the odd position of competing with his own unmatched reputation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19930801","headline":"Hypnotic Images From the Core of Islam","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/arts/art-view-hypnotic-images-from-the-core-of-islam.html","abstract":"  Religion and political conflict walk hand in hand.

Davis (1892-1964) incorporated this country's commercial icons into modern painting (anticipating Pop Art) in works like \"Lucky Strike\" (1921), and rewrote Cubism as a syncopated New World symphony, jazzing it up and making hot colors and hard-edged forms dance on a shallow stage. \"The amazing continuity\" is his own phrase: it appears as a slogan blazoned in black letters on the 1951 painting \"Visa.\" Lewis Kachur points out that for Davis, the line separating writing, drawing and painting was quite thin.

Its docks and quays bustled with commerce coming from and going to the New World. Culturally, too, this was Dublin's golden age. Jonathan Swift, who was dean of St. Patrick's, was writing his brilliant, vitriolic satires. In 1742 the world premiere of Handel's \"Messiah\" was presented at the Music Hall in Fishamble Street. The theater flourished. \"The School for Scandal,\" by the Irish-born playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, gives a good sense of fashionable life in the city.\n\nNowhere did this vitality express itself so impressively as in the domestic architecture commissioned by Dublin's Anglo-Irish elite. The most common style for aristocratic mansions was Palladian; later in the century, as more English and Irish visited Rome and Greece on their grand tours, a taste evolved for a purer classicism. During the past two decades, two outstanding 18th-century Irish buildings have been restored to their former glory. One of them, Newman House, is a grand Palladian structure typical of Dublin in its prime.

Mozart's \"Cosi Fan Tutte,\" which played here at the Glimmerglass Opera on Thursday night, comes astonishingly close. In Act I, Scene 2's quintet-trio sequence, a mysterious chemistry transforms sorrow and sarcasm into musical counterpoint; sentiment, in turn, becomes un-self-conscious formality. It is like observing the fervor and the geometry of a biblical painting all at once: a story told, and yet an arrangement of figures, the play of light, the fold of drapery.   Given such a miraculous union, producers of \"Cosi Fan Tutte\" usually rush to celebrate it. The Glimmerglass team -- Martha Clarke, the director; James Ingalls, the lighting designer, and Robert Israel, who made the sets and costumes -- has taken a more (dare I use the word?) deconstructionist viewpoint. Form and content have been pulled apart, like the sleeve from one of this season's modish jackets. One sees them separately and simultaneously. Not all of last night's orchestra playing and ensemble singing lived up to this fascinating dichotomy.

Musicians brought world music and pop and rhythm and blues to jazz, and for the most part the grafts have withered away. Wolfgang Muthspiel, a German guitarist, uses funk patterns, and a rock tone, and doesn't swing. But he does it all in a context -- using an acoustic bass, drums and a saxophone and fluegelhorn -- that means to imply a mainstream jazz sophistication. Add to that some techniques taken from the avant-garde of the 1960's, and Tuesday night's set became unsatisfying and a bit thoughtless.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930802","headline":"5 Shots Back, Floyd Catches Fire","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/02/sports/golf-5-shots-back-floyd-catches-fire.html","abstract":"  Ray Floyd has come to Long Island twice to play golf in his illustrious career and has walked away a winner each time.
