A crowd of 40,000 whistled at San Siro Stadium in Italy as Milan played a scoreless tie against the Swiss champion, FC Aarau, and advanced, 1-0, on aggregate in the home-and-home series. United, in its first home game in the Champions Cup at Old Trafford in 24 years, beat Honved Kispest of Hungary, 2-1, on a pair of goals by Steve Bruce and advanced, 5-3, on aggregate. On a night when 43 European games were played, all five Italian teams advanced. Joining AC Milan were Torino in the Cup Winners Cup and Cagliari, Inter Milan and Lazio in the U.E.F.A. Cup. Scottish champion Glasgow Rangers, which won the first leg at home, 3-2, allowed Nikolai Todarov to score in the final minute, giving Levski Sofia a 2-1 victory and sending the Bulgarians into the next round on away goals. The Spanish champion, Barcelona, led by a pair of goals from Jose Maria Bakero, beat Dinamo Kiev of Ukraine, 4-1, and advanced, 5-4, on aggregate.

All these factors, and one other, were in East's favor on the diagramed deal played Sunday at the Ramada Hotel, Seventh Avenue and 33d Street, in the New York City final of the North American Open Pairs. South's eccentric no-trump opening was no doubt aimed at silencing his opponents, but had the contrary effect.

The earthquake's hypocenter was around 10 km deep – relatively shallow – allowing shock waves to cause more damage. It is considered the deadliest earthquake in the stable continental crust to have occurred in recorded history."},{"title":"Modified Mercalli intensity scale","web_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Mercalli_intensity_scale","description":"Seismic intensity scale used to quantify the degree of shaking during earthquakes","thumbnail":null,"abstract":"The Modified Mercalli intensity scale, developed from Giuseppe Mercalli's Mercalli intensity scale of 1902, is a seismic intensity scale used for measuring the intensity of shaking produced by an earthquake. It measures the effects of an earthquake at a given location, distinguished from the earthquake's inherent force or strength as measured by seismic magnitude scales. While shaking is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. Deeper earthquakes also have less interaction with the surface, and their energy is spread out across a larger volume. Shaking intensity is localized, generally diminishing with distance from the earthquake's epicenter, but can be amplified in sedimentary basins and certain kinds of unconsolidated soils."}]}],"weather":[{"date":"19930930","time":"1993-09-30

Giuliani, followed by a series of unflattering black and white photos of Mr. Giuliani. As a male narrator's voice is heard over ominous music, blocks of text scroll on the screen repeating his words. At the end, a final question freezes on the screen, with a big picture of Mr. Giuliani and a small picture of Mayor David N. Dinkins, noting his campaign paid for the ad. PRODUCER   Doak Shrum Harris Carrier Devine of Washington. THE SCRIPT   Narrator: \"He was the third-highest official in Washington of the Reagan Justice Department that led an attack on the environment, tried to overturn a woman's right to choose, and turn back the clock on civil rights. He opposed banning cop killer bullets, waffled on gun control, and supported Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. As U.S. Attorney in New York, of the 146 people he hired, only 15 were Latino or black. He was accused of abuse of power, and Federal courts rebuked his conduct. Rudolph Giuliani: Can we elect a man who's fought against everything we stand for. ACCURACY   Mr. Giuliani was the Associate Attorney General, the No. 3 post in Justice, in the early Regan Administration, and the department was widely criticized on the issues the ad cites. In 1983, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee against a ban on armor-piercing bullets, arguing that it was impossible to cover all kinds capable of penetrating a bullet-proof vest \"without being overinclusive,\" and proposed instead mandatory five-year sentences for the use of such bullets in the commission of Federal crimes. In 1981, he called proposed gun-control laws that would impose waiting periods for handgun purchases \"sensible and moderate\" but more recently has said gun control laws are not especially effective. Roughly 10 percent of the laywers Mr. Giuliani hired as United States Attorney in Manhattan were black or Hispanic, comparable to the hiring in the city's Law Department at the time but roughly one-third the average level of hiring there since Mr. Dinkins took office. Many defense lawyers accused Mr. Giuliani of excessive zeal in his years as United States Attorney, Federal judges several times cited him or his office for \"overzealousness\" and some of his most celebrated prosecutions ended in acquittals or reversals on appeal. SCORECARD   This ad, unusually pointed for a low-key politician like Mr. Dinkins, is part of his campaign's continuing effort to paint Mr. Giuliani as a hard-hearted Reaganaut, unyielding and out of step with the liberal swing voters who are likely to help decide the election. It spans issues that have long been liberal touchstones. Virtually all the stands it cites predated the 1989 mayoral campaign, and were issues four years ago, but the Mayor's camp argues that Mr. Giuliani's record is little known or understood by most New Yorkers and must be attacked. The intent of the ad is to make the whole of Mr. Giuliani's sometimes shifting stands greater than the sum of its parts, though voters may find some of his past positions only marginally relevant to the next Mayor's job.

She played platinum-haired prostitutes, gold diggers and other trashy types with no apologies. In \"Red-Headed Woman,\" she strategically places a picture of her rich, married boss under her garter and says, \"It'll get me more there than it will hanging on the wall.\" In \"Red Dust,\" she decides to take a bath in a rain barrel, the better to get Clark Gable's attention. And in \"Hold Your Man,\" she fights a rival for Gable's affections by belting the other woman with a left to the jaw, twice. Yet in her seven-year career, Harlow was wildly popular with both men and women, who found more to envy than to scorn.   The Harlow retrospective that begins today at the Film Forum is a vastly entertaining reminder of a brief and fascinating career, one that ended when Harlow died of kidney failure in 1937, at 26. And the series suggests something more. Harlow's garishly dyed hair, pencil-thin eyebrows and heavy eye makeup mark her as a sex symbol left over from the day before yesterday. Yet in film after film she sails into the present carrying along her most prized and timeless possessions: a clear conscience and a sense of humor. Harlow was an exaggerated symbol of what middle-class America wouldn't dare embrace in real life: sex without guilt. In the AIDS-aware 90's, the allure of that persona and the wit with which she brought it off hit with the fresh force they must have had five decades ago.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931001","headline":"Colin Powell, Who Led U.S. Military Into a New Era, Resigns","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/01/us/colin-powell-who-led-us-military-into-a-new-era-resigns.html","abstract":"  Gen.

Its title calls it a \"reform,\" but it would lock in court rulings that have watered down the laws under which state court prisoners get their cases reviewed by Federal courts. This section of the bill has to do with the body of law built around the concept of habeas corpus -- literally \"you (might) have the body.\"   When a prisoner secures a writ of habeas corpus from a Federal court, the state authorities must show that the prisoner received a fair trial and that they are therefore authorized to \"have the body\" in prison. This body of law has ancient roots. It was intended to curb the power of monarchs to keep citizens under arrest and in custody.

The teams' records are in parentheses. P.S.A.L.  Sheepshead Bay (2-0) at Lafayette (1-2) Key Players: Both teams feature a ball-control offense and rely on hard-hitting defensive units. \"Brooklyn football is like the Midwest,\" said Sheepshead Bay Coach Dick Reilly. \"It's bang-bang football.\" Lafayette's linemen may have trouble moving defensive end Elvis Abellard (19 tackles) and Company off the ball, as the Frenchies are significantly smaller than the Skippers up front. Lafayette will probably have to throw the ball to create running lanes. Sheepshead Bay features a more balanced attack, as Michael Reilly, the coach's son, is a smart quarterback with an accurate arm to complement the fine running combination of Kwesi Daniels and Joe Coffey. Daniels received Sheepshead Bay's game ball last week after rushing for 145 yards on 18 carries and 1 touchdown in the 15-14 victory over Curtis. Daniels also registered 15 tackles and 2 sacks as a linebacker.  Comment: Lafayette has won the last two meetings against Sheepshead Bay in the closing seconds. Lafayette defeated the Skippers, 13-6, last year and by 19-17 in 1991. \"Those are the ones that put the white back into your beard,\" said Reilly, Sheepshead Bay's coach.  Lehman (1-1) at South Shore (0-2) Key Players: What South Shore quarterback Adrian Nazario lacks in size (5 foot 5 inches, and 150 pounds), he makes up in heart. \"He's a tough kid,\" said Coach Stan Feldman. \"He gets knocked down and he pops right back up. He's our leader.\" Nonetheless, the Vikings' offense still depends on the running of Tracey McDonald, Carlos Cromwell and Dwayne Bennett. Lehman needs Robert Talley to rebound from last week's 30-7 loss to Canarsie, in which he was limited to 27 yards rushing on 10 carries.  Comment: South Shore has yet to score a point this season, losing by 26-0 in its opener against Curtis and by 20-0 to Lincoln. \"I'm really proud of the boys,\" said Feldman. \"They haven't given up, and they've been gung-ho in practice.\"  C.H.S.F.L.  Spellman (2-1) at St. John the Baptist (3-0) Key Players: St. John the Baptist's offense is ranked No. 1 in the A Division, averaging 271.3 yards a game. Eric Martin (31 of 55 for 533 yards, 5 touchdowns, 1 interception), who is the division's leading passer, has three sure-handed targets in tight end Robert Kelly (11 receptions for 219 yards, 2 touchdowns), wide receiver Dennis McGuire (6 for 100 yards, 1 touchdown) and running back Mike Grippo (11 for 163 yards, 2 touchdowns). Martin's counterpart, David Rodriguez, is a pretty good signal caller himself, passing for 2 touchdowns and rushing for 2 others. Rodriguez's favorite receiver is Michael Baptiste (4 catches for 71 yards, 1 touchdown). Comment: Jay Byrne Gamble, the St. John the Baptist coach, is back after a 10-year hiatus. He has returned to the school where he had three consecutive Metro Bowl titles after serving part of the time as an assistant coach at Hofstra University. His presence, along with a new staff of assistants, has helped turn around a program that had a 12-35-1 record over the past three years.  St. Anthony (3-0) vs. Nazareth (2-0)  at Canarsie Key Players: St. Anthony has averaged a league-best 369 yards on the ground a game, while the Kingsmen defense has allowed a league-low of 89 yards rushing. The Friars' offense, which averages over 30 points a game, revolves around the backfield of Tony Williams (38 carries for 615 yards, 6 touchdowns), who is the league's leading gainer, and Dan Shea (22 carries for 268 yards, 6 touchdowns). Nazareth boasts a good inside (Julien Dale) and outside (Gordon Tunison) running attack. Dale, a 6-foot, 220-pound fullback, has carried 28 times for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns. Tinson is a 5-5, 140-pound tailback who has rushed 17 times for 218 yards and 3 touchdowns.  Comment: St. Anthony's backfield is quick and has been aided by playing all of its games on Astroturf, an advantage that St. Anthony's runners will enjoy once again this afternoon. Long Island  Longwood (1-0) at Brentwood (0-1) Key Players: Longwood's backfield of Jason Schuster (4.6 for 40 yards), John Lange (4.7 speed) and quarterback Eric Brown (4.5 speed) is lightning quick. The threesome combined last week for over 400 yards rushing in a 35-7 victory over Ward Melville. Felipe Sabino will do most of Brentwood's running behind Carl Matzen (6-2, 286-pound tackle) and John Alvarado (6-2, 250-pound guard), both of whom anchor the right side. Comment: Longwood is ranked No. 2 in Suffolk County and 21st in New York State by the Sports Writers Association. Last year, Longwood lost to Connetquot, 28-7, in the county's final. \"I think that experience is going to help us,\" said Schuster. \"We experienced what it's like, and hopefully we're going to learn from it.\" New Jersey  Elizabeth (1-0) at Linden (1-0) Key Players: Elizabeth is once again loaded with Division 1 talent: tailback Kaream Bowser, Sharod Williams (wr-db), Hector Sepuleeda (dt-og) and linebacker Frank Chmiel are all being heavily recruited by colleges. This talented bunch is directed by sophomore Al Hawkins, who is a \"scary quarterback who could throw the long ball off his heels,\" said Linden Coach James McDonald. Linden's two blue-chip prospects are two-way ends Mike Pringley (6-4, 218) and Dave Biles (6-4, 275).  Comment: Last year, Elizabeth had eight Division 1 players but only managed a 5-4 record. \"We had a bunch of superstars that were only interested in themselves,\" said Coach Jerry Moore. He added that this year's team works better together. \"I like the chemistry of this group. They work hard and are very aggressive. And when we hit you, you stay hit. They are playing Elizabeth's style of football.\"  Fieldston (1-1) at Dwight-Englewood (0-2) Key Players: \"To let Gus Ornstein set up is to set yourself up to get beat,\" Englewood Coach Dave Hansburg said of Fieldston's quarterback. Ornstein (16 of 35 for 219, 1 touchdown, 1 interception), who is being recruited by Michigan, Notre Dame and Miami as a quarterback and first baseman, has the ability to pick apart opposing defenses if given the time. Sam Gilbert (4 catches, 122 yards, 1 td) is Fieldston's deep threat. Fieldston will have to contain the Bulldogs backfield of Josh Walsky, Rick Komotar and Steve Milo. Comment: The outcome will be determined on the line of scrimmage, where Fieldston's over-matched line will be called upon to hold back the rush of tackles Luis Locuroto and Matt Seiff.  Connecticut  Bassick (1-1) at Darien (1-1) Key Players: Johnny Barnes (23 carries for 154 yards, 3 touchdowns) is the best of Bassick's speedy backs capable of springing at any time. James Hanford (172 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns) and Vince Childress (181 yards, 2 touchdowns) share the running duties for Darien. Jeff Eaton's (13 for 32 for 221 yards, 2 touchdowns) ability to complete the short passes gives the Blue Wave's offense a more diversified attack than Bassick's. Chris Robbins (9 catches for 193 yards, 1 touchdown) is Eaton's primary target.  Comment: Darien Coach Mike Sangster says he plans to drop a few plays from the teams' playbook after losing by 21-20 to Greenwich last week, snapping the teams' 16-game unbeaten string. \"I just think that we made too many mistakes last week and that we need to go back to the basics,\" he said. Westchester and Rockland  North Rockland (3-0) at Roosevelt (3-0) Key Players: While both teams are comparable in size, North Rockland's linemen hold the advantage over the Indians' less experienced big men. Tom Morreira (tackle, 6-2, 270), Conrad Bartosik (guard, 6-0, 200), Ed Teitz (center, 6-2, 260), Tom Johnson (guard, 6-0, 200) and Rajah Winn (tackle, 5-9, 260) will need to gain maturity in a hurry and find a way to open holes for Roosevelt's star runner, Franklin McBride. He has rushed for 4 scores and over 100 yards in each of the teams' games. McBride's counterpart is Marcus Larkins, a 5-8, 170-pound runner who has rushed for 344 yards and 5 touchdowns. Raiders quarterback Jeff Becker (12 of 25 for 281 yards, 5 touchdowns) is a quality drop-back passer who sees the whole field and delivers the ball with accuracy. Comment: \"This could be the biggest game ever played in Westchester and Rockland County,\" said Roosevelt Coach Tony Dematteo. The teams have never met during the regular season. The game will be carried live on Channel 3 on TCI Cable.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Rose Bowl? Northwestern?

But he will have to contend with Dent, a runner-up in this event the last two years. Dent tied Trevino with birdies on three of the last four holes and a 31 on the back nine.

Mr. Henry is steeped in Bob Dylan; his tunes aim for a folky simplicity, and his voice catches in his nose and the back of his throat. Over the course of five albums, he has gradually pared away self-consciously poetic imagery and overwrought self-pity. Although he hasn't exactly cheered up, his songs have moved toward the terse, homespun approach of country.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Reviews/Film Festival; A Question of Incest, Posed Quietly","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/02/movies/reviews-film-festival-a-question-of-incest-posed-quietly.html","abstract":"  Aline Issermann's \"Shades of Doubt\" (\"L'Ombre du Doute\"), a French film about a wrenching family crisis, is set forth with remarkable restraint. The subject is incest, but the story's potential for tawdriness is never exploited. Instead, Ms. Issermann presents a discreet, methodical account of how 12-year-old Alexandrine (Sandrine Blancke) comes to bring and then recant charges against her father, Jean (Alain Bashung).   If the director's approach is at all representative, then the cultural differences between French and American approaches to this subject are fascinating. The American impulse toward tabloid sensationalism is nowhere evident; nor is the urge to air all the family's dirty laundry in the interests of catharsis. If anything, the LeBlancs feel profoundly embarrassed by their problem and wish it would simply go away. In a climate of sexual sophistication and naturalness, the charge of incest is perhaps even more devastating than it would be in dysfunction-conscious America.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931002","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/02/nyregion/c-corrections-861593.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a brief report in the Company News column of Business Day yesterday, about the acquisition of the Dexter Shoe Company by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., misstated the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock.
