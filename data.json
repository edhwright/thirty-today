For starters there are steamed mussels in white wine and garlic; minestrone with clams; carpaccio of smoked tuna, and grilled shrimp with a white bean salad.

The traffic, the potholes, the irksome pedestrians, the windshield glass sprinkled across pavement like salt on a burger -- you stop and start, stop and start. No rhythm on these roads. It shouldn't be a surprise for people to learn -- or remember -- that back in the early 80's, when mountain bikes were first becoming popular, they were promoted here as city bikes.    As a New Yorker and a cyclist who rarely cycles in New York, I've never felt that simply wanting to ride was enough of a reason to haul my bike into the elevator, carry it down the front stairs and into the street and then begin the ongoing abrasive discourse with the urban elements that city cycling requires. Elsewhere people ride bikes expressly for recreation, but New York is a place where a meandering, relaxing spin for its own sake is not just ill-advised; it's probably impossible. There are the circular drives around the various parks, of course, but it seems as though the cyclists there travel only in fast-moving packs, which, for the independent practitioner, turns the enterprise of bike riding into a kind of join-them-or-die proposition.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"FILM: The Attack of the Big Summer Movies; Coming Soon: Whatever They Sent Us A Trailer Of","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/movies/film-attack-big-summer-movies-coming-soon-whatever-they-sent-us-trailer.html","abstract":"  AUDIENCES WILL NOT BE surprised to encounter a coming attraction for \"Wyatt Earp\" when they go to see \"Maverick,\" which opens on Friday; both are big westerns with popular stars, and both come from Warner Brothers.

After that's stabilized, either successfully or in failure, he'll take time to restock and rethink. With Leland gone, he'll have a new sense of freedom, and come into his own.

He'll coach his son's basketball team, and continue to fight for the rights of people.\" Corbin Bernsen, who played Arnie Becker, the philandering specialist in divorce law. \"It all depends on whether he stays in the firm or not. Arnie is a little boy in search of what it means to be a \"man\" -- wife, children and so forth...and be pained by not getting it.

The Polish school of graphic art was noteworthy for its reprise and synthesis of Dada and Surrealism into a symbolic language that was at once playful and subversive. Roman Cieslewicz, a master of the Polish school, reinvigorated prewar Surrealism through his wit and humor. His eclectic typography, at various times influenced by Russian Constructivism, the Bauhaus, Art Nouveau and Art Moderne, and absurdist conceptual collages reminiscent of Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp, helped revitalize a moribund visual culture. Perhaps he was too influential, for Poland allowed him to emigrate to Paris in 1963, where he first took a job as a layout designer and illustrator for Elle, and was soon sought after as a freelance designer of book jackets, posters, advertisements and screen prints. Mr. Cieslewicz did not invent the photo-collage, but judging from his late Polish and later French work he was certainly its pre-eminent modern practitioner. Margo Rouard-Snowman's ROMAN CIESLEWICZ (Thames and Hudson, paper, $29.95) is an extensive catalogue of his best-known pieces -- from the sarcastic covers of the magazine Opus International to the haunting collages about human cruelty that illustrate a 1988 edition of Anatole France's novel \"The Gods Are Thirsty.\" The brief texts at the beginning of each chronological section and an interview with the artist by Ms. Rouard-Snowman, who teaches graphic design at the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, tersely explain motives and methods, but the book would be valuable if only for the extraordinary record (from 1955 to the present) of Mr. Cieslewicz's impressive output.

Entering this special room in a stately English country home known as Blatch ards, one discovers that it is green.

In the January issue of BBC magazine, H. C. Robbins Landon, the dean of Haydn scholars, certified the works as genuine. The February issue printed a retraction: the handwriting in the manuscript seemed to date from the 20th century; the engraver probably used a steel-nibbed pen, which came into use only in the mid-19th century; staves were peculiar, and so on.

Mr. Clinton had regarded him as aloof and unappealing when they met last year, but in the end, Judge Breyer presented the fewest problems, and his friends convinced the President that he had misjudged him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Urban League Celebrates 75 Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/style/evening-hours-urban-league-celebrates-75-years.html","abstract":"  New York Urban League's dinner, Sheraton New York, May 5.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"Sharon Kivisto, David Fleming","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/style/weddings-sharon-kivisto-david-fleming.html","abstract":"  Sharon Irene Kivisto, a daughter of George and Lillian Kivisto of Narragansett, R.I., is to be married there today to David John Fleming, a son of Thomas and Alice Fleming of New York.

Centuries ago, the strategic location of this Indian Ocean outpost, along with fertile soil, teeming seas and forests of ancient black ebony, made it a sought-after prize among imperial European nations. Successive colonization by the Dutch, French and British, combined with periodic influxes of Indians, Africans and Chinese, has left Mauritius with a wondrous variety of cuisines, languages, crafts and cultures, and a populace whose degree of ethnic diversity is probably unique in an island less than two-thirds the size of Rhode Island. The name Mauritius is Dutch; the island was named in 1598 in honor of Prince Mauritius van Nassau of the Netherlands.  More than half of the population of 1.1 million follows some form of Hinduism. \n\nThe country's official language is English, newspapers are printed in French and more than half a dozen Indian languages are also widely used. Among themselves, however, most Mauritians speak a Creole not much different from what is spoken in Haiti or parts of Louisiana -- a language that has hung on since the 18th century, even though it is not taught in schools and has no written form.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940515","headline":"30 New High Schools Report First-Year Success","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/nyregion/30-new-high-schools-report-first-year-success.html","abstract":"  It is a small triumph of the Coalition School for Social Change, one of 30 experimental high schools begun in New York City last fall, that Shenelle Nolan has been swinging her bookbag under her desk and sitting down for her first-period math class on time in recent weeks.

Nixon's White House was being slowly and inexorably crushed by the growing weight of Watergate, it was fashionable among some in Europe to ridicule America's preoccupation with the scandal. Fred Emery, who at the time was the Washington bureau chief for The Times of London, recently recalled having to persuade his editor, William Rees-Mogg, not to refer to the American journalists as a \"lynch mob,\" because the editor regarded their pursuit of Nixon as unseemly.   So it is curious, in a way, that it is the British -- specifically, the British Broadcasting Corporation -- who are now first in line to remember and mark the approaching 20th anniversary of Nixon's resignation, with a voluminous five-part documentary series on Watergate. Running for an hour each Sunday night through June 5, the broadcasts on BBC2, the network's second national channel, use snippets from the White House tape recordings, pieces of archival film and fresh interviews with nearly all of the principal players -- but not the former President himself -- to reconstruct what the documentary describes as the \"greatest political scandal in American history.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940516","headline":"My Thanh An Journal; G.I.

Fittipaldi came up short at 227.303 yesterday, good for the outside of the front row for the May 29 race. Fittipaldi, the two-time and defending Indy winner, and the 1969 winner Mario Andretti were among seven drivers who made qualifying attempts yesterday during an extension of the first of four days of time trials, made necessary because of rain on Saturday. Each of the entries that drew for a position in the first-day qualifying order was guaranteed one shot at the pole when track activity resumed Sunday. Fittipaldi had been favored to beat Unser, his Marlboro Team Penske teammate, for the coveted pole, worth more than $130,000 in cash and prizes. Raul Boesel of Brazil, driving one of the five Dick Simon-owned cars that made successful attempts on the first day, wound up between Unser and Fittipaldi at 227.618. By the end of yesterday's session, 30 of the 33 positions were filled, with additional qualifications scheduled next Saturday and Sunday. Once the field is full, faster cars can bump out the slowest qualifiers until the end of the time trials.

The first two spots on Monaco's starting grid were left open in honor of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, two Formula One drivers killed two weeks ago.

Lancaster won for the first time in his five years on the tour when he sank a 4-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole at the TPC at Las Colinas. He beat David Ogrin, David Edwards, the Japanese rookie Yoshi Mizumaki, Tom Byrum and Mark Carnevale, all having completed one round on each of two rain-soaked courses for totals of nine-under-par 132.

Yesterday the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, announced that Roussel-Uclaf, its manufacturer, had donated its U.S. patent rights for mifespristone (RU-486) to the Population Council, a nonprofit contraceptive research group. The \"gift\" is testimony both to Roussel's considerable wariness about the wrath of anti-abortionists -- and to the Clinton Administration's considerable powers of persuasion.   Roussel-Uclaf agreed over a year ago to license RU-486, which has been used safely by thousands of European women, to the Population Council. But the company, fearful that America's anti-abortionists might organize boycotts of its other pharmaceuticals, dragged its feet over signing a contract. Thus American women were denied not only a drug that can make abortion the wholly private decision it should be, but one that holds great potential for the treatment of endometriosis, fibroid tumors and breast cancer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940517","headline":"Christopher Takes Syrian Response to Rabin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/world/christopher-takes-syrian-response-to-rabin.html","abstract":"  Indirect peace negotiations between Israel and Syria gathered momentum today as Secretary of State Warren Christopher brought Syria's response to an Israeli peace plan to Jerusalem after having pressed Damascus to flesh out additional details.

The 31-year-old Polish grandmaster scored 7-2 to take the $800 first prize in the 10-player invitational event.

U.S.A.   1 1/2         In Round 6, Wojtkiewicz demonstrated logical counterattacking play in the center in winning from the Brooklyn international master Joshua Waitzkin.   The fianchetto with 6 g3 and 7 Bg2 is a quiet, positional method of dealing with the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense: the white KB reinforces the e4 pawn and is intended to squelch a black counterattack in the center with a later . . . d5. By developing with 6 . . . e6, 7 . . . Bd7 and 8 . . . Nc6, thus postponing . . . O-O, Black prevents his king from becoming an early target for attack on the kingside.   The plan in playing 9 Nce2 is to prepare for a Maroczy bind with a follow-up c4. However, after 9 . . . Rc8, a result of 10 c4 Nd4 11 Qd4 b5 12 cb ab would have been to dissolve the fetter and free the black queenside.   Perhaps Waitzkin should have played 18 g5 to elicit 18 . . . Ne8 and thus diminish Black's influence in the center. His kingside might then have become a little loose, but that was a risk he might have taken.   Wojtkiewicz prepared logically for the key counterattack, 19 . . . d5!, which negated whatever merit the white position was supposed to have. On 20 ed Bd5 21 Bd5 Rd5, Black would have been ready to attack the weak, backward c2 pawn. Moreover, 20 g5 could have been rebuffed by 20 . . . Qe5 Bd6 22 Qc3 b4 23 Qe3 Nd5 24 Qe4? Nc3. Waitzkin chose 20 e5, but after 20 . . . Ne4, Wojtkiewicz enjoyed excellent piece play and a powerful initiative.

The current justices, too, evidently find Ellis Island worthy of their attention: just hours earlier, they agreed to resolve a long-running dispute between New York and New Jersey over which state has jurisdiction over the 27.5-acre island -- most of it landfill -- that sits between the two states in Upper New York Bay. Political Jurisdiction in Question    The Court, without comment, issued an order permitting New Jersey to proceed with its lawsuit, which the state filed against New York last year directly in the Supreme Court. Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over lawsuits between states, and sits not as an appellate court but as a trial court when it accepts such suits for decision. In nearly all cases, the Justices refer the matter to a special master for hearings and recommendations, a step the Justices will probably take later this year.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940517","headline":"Fragmenting Space Debris Could Put Satellites at Risk","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/science/fragmenting-space-debris-could-put-satellites-at-risk.html","abstract":"  CHAIN reactions are rather commonplace on earth. They occur in chemical plants when a single excited molecule prompts its neighbors into a cascade of combination to create plastics. In nuclear reactors, they occur whenever a speeding subatomic particle slams into a heavy atom and splits it apart, releasing more particles that repeat and amplify the process in bursts of energy. By definition, chain reactions are spectacles of intensification, at times spreading like wildfire through dry grass.   Now, experts say, a dangerous new kind of chain reaction is getting under way in space, where it threatens to limit or end certain aspects of mankind's endeavors beyond the planet.  For instance, it could put billions of dollars worth of advanced communication and weather satellites at risk of destruction.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940517","headline":"For Devils, It's Just One Game And a Half","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/sports/hockey-for-devils-it-s-just-one-game-and-a-half.html","abstract":"  The stakes were higher for the Devils, and so their mood was predictably upbeat today after they won Sunday night's opener against the Rangers.
