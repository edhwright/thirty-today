His testimony answered several questions -- but raised as many more.

Hugo Tiest, coordinator of a church-based group, Justice and Peace of the Haitian Conference of Religion, which supports the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. \"I am afraid of the end results.\" A Long View    Some Haitians said they remained optimistic that a peaceful way could be found out of the impasse that has hardened since army leaders ousted Father Aristide in September 1991.  \"We spent 300 years in slavery,\" said Bayyinah Bello, who works with several local political groups. \"So three years in the life of a people is no time.\"   The Haitian military's campaign of terror has largely been aimed at the local organizations that form the backbone of Father Aristide's support, trying to insure that if the exiled President returns, he will not be able to govern.   The level of intimidation increased on Monday after the army-backed Government ordered all human rights observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States to leave Haiti by today. On Tuesday, about 12 bodies riddled with bullets were dumped into a shallow grave near Leogane, 18 miles west.    In the months that they have been in the country, the 100 or so monitors have concluded that many killings were directly attributable to the army and its allies.  A Sample of Intimidation    Today, two men who said they were supporters of the exiled President walked into Father Tiest's downtown office and told him they needed help. But the priest said he became suspicious when the men showed him a picture of Father Aristide instead of identification.    One man drew a gun and demanded files. Father Tiest said a worker then screamed for help and the men fled. \"These are assassins and criminals,\" the priest said.   With the departure of the international observers, Haitian human rights workers are wondering how effectively they can do their work.    \"We find ourselves alone in the face of the reality of political repression,\" said Jean Robert Vaval, of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights. \"But we will continue to fight for human rights. It's our job.\"   Mr. Vaval and others said that while much attention had been given to the plight of Haitian boat people, the refugeees within the country were an even more serious problem. These refugees, estimated at 350,000, have left their jobs and homes and live in a different city every week, trying to keep ahead of marauding soldiers.   One such refugee, a man in his 30's, said he was a member of a political organization in the Artibonite Valley in northwest Haiti. Since the coup, he said, he has moved from house to house until finding refuge in a Port-au-Prince church.  Pay Attention, World    \"I am not afraid because I have weathered the worst,\" he said, adding that he was arrested several months ago and released because of the intervention of the international observers. \"But too many people have suffered for me and now I don't want to jeopardize their lives.\"   The international monitors have been been reluctant to talk, fearing their comments might upset Haiti's military leaders. But many have voiced sadness at having to leave without completing their task.    \"I hope that the international community thinks this is enough and takes some decisive action to end this crisis now,\" said one member of the mission. \"It's a turning point because some people have perceived before that this was mainly a U.S. problem.\"                     --------------------       Corpses as a Weapon    WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) -- Haiti's rulers are intensifying repression, and their latest tactic is to dump the bodies of murdered political opponents in the streets to terrorize the people, a State Department official said today.    The official, Nancy Ely-Raphel, from the department's human rights section, said that in the past two weeks, several corpses of young men with their hands tied behind their backs had been found in the streets of Port-au-Prince.    Ms. Ely-Raphel said 133 killings had been reported between February and May. But she added: \"We believe we may now be seeing a further ratcheting up of repression. The latest developments include increased dumping of bodies in public areas of Port-au-Prince in an attempt to terrorise the populace.\"                     --------------------       Exercise in Bahamas    WASHINGTON, July 13 (AP) -- Several hundred United States marines began a practice invasion-and-rescue operation today on Grand Inagua Island in the Bahamas, 150 miles northwest of Haiti, Pentagon sources said.

Mr. Williams was a relatively unknown singer based in Chicago, and Count Basie was suffering from the general decline in interest in big bands. Their collaboration, matching a gleaming, industrial-strength orchestra with the dry and clipped singing of Mr. Williams, was a high point in blues culture, and \"Every Day I Have the Blues,\" a single from the album, rose to the No. 2 spot on the rhythm-and-blues charts.   Since then Count Basie has died, and blues culture is fading away as a training ground for younger musicians. But Mr. Williams, who is appearing through Sunday at the Blue Note, backed by the Count Basie Orchestra led by Frank Foster, remains something special, a way into a sound and musical attitude that by and large no longer exist. And on the basis of the first set on Tuesday night, Mr. Williams, 75, is more than able to make a lesson in history seem utterly contemporary, turning his art into something thrilling.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940714","headline":"Helping Excite Toronto Over Books for 20 Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/14/books/helping-excite-toronto-over-books-for-20-years.html","abstract":"  It's 8 P.M. on a Tuesday in a cultural center on transformed industrial land along Lake Ontario.

While the court stopped short of dictating guidelines or setting specific financial goals, it was forceful in stating the direction that it feels the state must go.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940714","headline":"Provision on Racial Bias in Death Sentences Appears Unlikely for Crime Bill","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/14/us/provision-on-racial-bias-in-death-sentences-appears-unlikely-for-crime-bill.html","abstract":"  With the Congressional clock ticking, efforts to break the logjam over the Clinton Administration's anti-crime package have broken down, and there is little expectation that the final bill will include a provision that its proponents say would help prevent racial bias in death sentences.

Mr. Clinton and both parties in Congress are eager for this election-year crime bill, which has something for everyone: severe new penalties, including five dozen new Federal death penalties; billions for police, prisons and prevention programs; a ban on assault weapons, and a host of other measures.

A year ago, Nigeria's generals decided to allow their people a whiff of democracy under highly controlled circumstances. Two political parties were formed under military tutelage; two carefully screened candidates were allowed to contest the presidency. Even so, when voters failed to approve the regime's first choice, the military ruler broke his promises, annulled the election and robbed the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, of victory.    The result has been a grass-roots pro-democratic uprising that the current military clique has been unable to quell. The crisis deepened a few weeks ago when Mr. Abiola, a Muslim and millionaire with a following in Nigeria's non-Muslim south, proclaimed himself President on the first anniversary of the canceled election. For that he was charged with treason, held incommunicado and threatened with a life sentence. When a federal high court judge twice ordered the military to produce Mr. Abiola in open court, the junta ignored the order.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Sound-Art Installation Closes Early in Paris","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/arts/sound-art-installation-closes-early-in-paris.html","abstract":"  \"Sound Island,\" a sound-art installation at the Arc de Triomphe by Bill Fontana, an American, has closed, seven weeks before its planned late-August termination.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee want to know, and over the last three days they have poked into unusual corners of Judge Stephen G. Breyer's life to find out. Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, looked for literary landmarks. Judge Breyer's response spoke volumes.    Q. Tell me your favorite books.   A. Where do people start? They start with Shakespeare. Say why Shakespeare and you say why -- -- this I tell students, you know, a lot of them come from some different school and they'll come from some place, they say, 'What's in Shakespeare for me?' You say, 'Well, if you're willing to put in the time, he's a little bit archaic, you know, the language, but if you put in the time, what you see there is, you see every different person, you see every different kind of person, you see every situation there is in the world. You see people saying things that they would say if only they had that ability to say them. And you see the whole thing in poetry.'   I mean, that's why people turn to that and they turn to that a little bit in literature to get some of the things that Senator  [ Paul ]  Simon was talking about, I think, which is what's in the heart of that person who is leading that different kind of life. And sometimes you can find some of that in literature.   I like Conrad very much. Why? I think because I'm moved often by the way in which he talks about the need for people -- all of us -- to learn from the past and then to give something to the future. Whether that's through our families or whether that's through our careers, we do learn from our parents, we do learn from the past, we do try to transmit things of value. And I think he finds value in human communities. I think he finds human communities to be ultimately the sources of obligations and values toward each other.   I read something that moved me a lot not very long ago. I was reading something by Chesterton, and he was talking about one of the Brontes, I think her \"Jane Eyre.\" He says you go and look out at the city -- I think he was looking at London -- and he said you know, you see all those houses now, even at the end of the 19th century, and they look all as if they're the same. And you think all those people are out there going to work and they're all the same.    He says, but what Bronte tells you is they're not the same. Each one of those persons in each one of those houses and each one of those families is different, and they each have a story to tell. Each of those stories involves something about human passion. Each of those stories involves a man, a woman, children, families, work, lives -- and you get that sense out of the book.    And so sometimes I've found literature very helpful as a way out of the tower.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940715","headline":"Hulk Hogan, on Witness Stand, Tells of Steroid Use in Wrestling","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/nyregion/hulk-hogan-on-witness-stand-tells-of-steroid-use-in-wrestling.html","abstract":"  He is famous as the flamboyant wrestler Hulk Hogan.

Updated from the 1951 film starring Paul Douglas as George Knox, a hard-hearted baseball coach, the new version has a glowering Danny Glover in the role of Knox, who is now the bitter, scowling manager of the California Angels.    The Angels, who are in last place, are so bad that their playing is buffoonish. But with some unexpected heavenly intervention, they begin performing wondrous feats. What transforms the team from pathetic clowns into heroic ones is a little boy's fervent prayer. When Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an 11-year-old foster child, hears his father, a drifter, sarcastically remark that the chances of the family's reuniting are as good as those of the Angels winning the pennant, the boy takes it as a promise. That night, Roger prays to a star for the Angels to win the pennant, and it twinkles back at him. The very next day, winged, white-robed seraphim, visible only to Roger, appear in the stadium to help the players make impossible catches, hit crucial home runs and throw some of the fastest balls ever pitched.

Bette Davis made 101 films during a career that lasted six decades.

As Mayor of this city, where the Brazilian soccer team has stayed during the World Cup games, he is ready to become nothing less than a patron saint in Brazil if the team beats Italy in the finals on Sunday.\n\nFor a month, the Mayor and the 30,000 residents of Los Gatos, 50 miles south of San Francisco, have learned that the World Cup is not a matter of life or death. It is much more than that to the Brazilian fans who partied all night for days on end, ignoring the police in riot gear and the local drinking laws. Los Gatos residents now know how to say hello in Portuguese (Oi). They also know who Romario, Bebeto and Branco are. And they now call the game football, not soccer. \n\nAnd what if Brazil wins on Sunday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena? \"I'll be taken back to Rio that night and they'll teach me how to really party,\" the 46-year-old Mayor and air-conditioner salesman said. \n\nHe has already had some lessons in Los Gatos, where the Brazilians' nonstop samba dancing on the streets angered some residents. There was the time that Brazilian drumming kept punctuating a concert of John Philip Sousa marching songs. There was also the the dispute over whether Brazilian women could wear string bikinis in the streets of this quiet, well-to-do bedroom community of Victorian houses.\n\nSandy Eddy, president of the Downtown Association and owner of a second-hand store, said the town was in conflict on the Fourth of July, when Brazil played and beat the American team. That night, the police said, 30,000 people, Brazilians, Americans and other soccer fans, came to town for a spontaneous party. \n\nBut residents are no longer torn. The green Brazilian flags are hanging in store windows. And although banners are prohibited, a sign stretches across the main thoroughfare: \"Los Gatos Wishes the Brasilian Team Good Luck! Boa Sorte!\"\n\n\"We have become Brazil's parent,\" Ms. Eddy said. \"It is like our child is out there who we have supported for two months.\"\n\nThe story of how the team chose Los Gatos as its American headquarters has been repeated so often it has taken on mythic proportions. The Mayor said Brazilian dignitaries and football officials who came to the area in the winter to look for lodging for the team were unhappy with the frenetic atmosphere in San Francisco and San Jose, the two biggest cities near the Stanford Stadium, where the team played most of its games. \n\nThe delegation came to lunch at a Los Gatos restaurant, Cafe Marcella, which had closed after lunch that day but reopened for the Brazilians. The waiters, said to be soccer nuts, showered the visitors with attention and won them over.\n\nSecurity was important to the team, so officials found the Lodge for Villa Felice, a small, family-owned place in a residential neighborhood surrounded by a wall. \n\nWhen Mayor Attaway heard the Brazilian team had booked rooms in town, he wrote to the Brazilian consulate in San Francisco to ask if the team would put on a soccer demonstration for local children. His request was rejected. \n\nSo the Mayor decided to go to Brazil personally and ask the head of the soccer federation if the team would reconsider. It was his first trip outside the United States. When he arrived, he was shuttled to a news conference, where about 40 reporters grilled him about everything, from what he knew about soccer to how he would handle drunken Brazilians. He knew little about soccer, he admitted, and as for drunken people, he would tell the police to unite them with friends who were sober.\n\nA reporter accused him of evading the question. It was at that moment, Mr. Attaway said, that he understood the seriousness of the World Cup to Brazilians.\n\n\"Is this really happening to me?\" he asked himself at the time. \"I'm a small-town Mayor. I don't have a college degree and I've been thrown into an international situation.\"\n\nMr. Attaway did cause something of an international incident when he was asked whether the town would permit women to wear skimpy string bikinis popular in Brazil. The Mayor's answer was equivocal: \"We want to be good hosts but we also need to protect our residents. We want to do something that our families could appreciate.\"\n\nBrazilian headlines declared that Los Gatos had outlawed bikinis: \"Los Gatos proibe biquini em festa.\" The Mayor denied that such a law existed and insured the rights of Brazilians to wear their traditional bikinis. \n\nThe team arrived on May 26, about a month before the games began. During their practice, they gave the soccer demonstration for the town's children. In all the time they were in town, no one was arrested for indecent exposure. \n\nAfter the players checked out of the lodge on July 6 and headed for Los Angeles for the final games, Brazilian tourists started coming, asking where Romario, the star, stayed (Room 211), what the players bought in town (electronics) and how many times the staff had to do laundry for them (twice a day). At the front desk, the team members left a clay doll, which they said was their guardian angel. A clock in the front office still keeps Brazilian time, four hours ahead.\n\nSome residents, however, were relieved to see the Brazilians go. Dave Knapp, the town manager, said there were several complaints about the big party on the Fourth of July. \"The party happened,\" he said. \"We knew it would happen. You can't plan a hurricane, you can only prepare for it.\"\n\nThe grumblers may feel differently after Sunday. If Brazil wins, the players say, Los Gatos will become a sacred place, a Mecca for Brazilian tourists for years to come. The same thing happened to Guadalajara, Mexico, the team's host city in 1970, the last time Brazil won the World Cup. \n\nOne attraction on the Los Gatos tour would be the Willow Street Wood-Fired Pizza restaurant, party central for the Brazilians. The restaurant's manager, Shannon Kinney, said the Brazilians had taught her to not take things so seriously. \"They danced on the tables, chairs, dividers,\" she said. \"All the landscaping is gone. We sing that 'Ole, Ole' song in our sleep.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940716","headline":"BRIEFCASE : Foreign Firms Stampeding For Share Listings in U.S.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/16/your-money/IHT-briefcase-foreign-firms-stampeding-for-share-listings-in-us.html","abstract":"The rush of non-U.S. companies to list their shares in the United States accelerated in the first half of this year.

Verdi, contracted to produce a work for La Scala, disliked the libretto and worked unenthusiastically. While he was composing, both he and his wife fell ill, and his wife died. Both audience and critics disliked the opera at its premiere in 1840, and it was immediately pulled from the repertory. And Verdi found the exercise so depressing that he considered giving up composition. The best he could say for the work, decades later, was that equally poor operas by other composers have fared better.   He had a point. \"Un Giorno di Regno\" may be two hours of chirpy, formulaic music of numbing triviality, but works with similar attributes by Rossini and Donizetti have become repertory staples.
