In \"Owners,\" her first play to be produced professionally, she attacked the right of ownership, as it applies to real estate and marital relations. When the work was staged in the 1970's, critics were put off by the anarchic storytelling.

Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena,\" which Ms. Queler conducted on Wednesday night at Carnegie Hall, isn't exactly obscure: it was first revived in 1957 with Maria Callas in the title role, and has become one of the five or six better-known Donizetti operas. But it has somehow failed to establish itself firmly in the repertory. Its persistent underestimation is puzzling; this is possibly Donizetti's finest tragic opera, at the very least a more dramatically sound and musically fluid work than \"Lucia di Lammermoor.\"    First staged in 1830, \"Anna Bolena\" was Donizetti's first major success, the opera that marked his emergence as a rival of Bellini. The composer had the good fortune to receive a superb libretto from Felice Romani; the historical record of Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour and Henry VIII was set aside in favor of psychologically precise character studies. Anne turns away the advances of Lord Percy and the musician Smeton, but the king's infatuation with Jane guarantees that disaster will fall all the same. The key to the piece is the king, whose patriarchal malevolence dooms the lyric strains of romance around him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930412","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/12/nyregion/chronicle-203293.html","abstract":"  When the Soviet Union split apart and the Communist Party collapsed, cultural institutions were left floundering without the financial and legal help of a monolithic dictatorship.

They believe that with the Bosnian Muslims' and Croats' signing of the U.N. peace accord, the pressure on the Serbs has mounted, and that the Serbs will risk further isolation and condemnation unless they sign. Not since Neville Chamberlain's capitulation at Munich has the world expected so much of war criminals.   The homilies and promises of a new world order will not be worth the countless hours of speeches, voluminous contents of foreign policy journals, mountains of U.N. documentation and talking heads' pieties on TV if the world fails its straightforward test. Genocide is being carried out on TV news every day; this is not Cambodia, where we could pretend we did not see it.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930412","headline":"Hooray, a Comeback!

Unlike Lincoln Center's Mozart Bicentennial, which crammed Mozart's works into 18 months, the plan here was to offer Schubert's works chronologically, taking from 1988 to 1997 to present them. That proved commercially unworkable, at least in the short term: the early seasons drew connoisseurs and revealed a few gems, but as with Mozart and Beethoven, the works likely to draw big audiences come near the end. The chronological approach was scuttled just as the series was heading toward the popular works, but at least the project has continued.   The new format has its own logic. Instead of tracing the big picture, the Schubertiade now offers glimpses into specific aspects of the composer's work, with early and late works performed side by side. This year the focus was on Schubert's piano sonatas, and instead of distributing the works among several players, Andras Schiff played them all (except for a few fragmentary ones) in a six-concert series that ended on April 3 evening. A master class the next afternoon was a kind of extended coda.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930412","headline":"Dance in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/12/arts/dance-in-review-985693.html","abstract":"  Junko Kikuchi  Dia Center for the Arts 155 Mercer Street, SoHo    Junko Kikuchi has long been singled out for the quality of her dancing, and maturity has not dulled her clarity, simplicity and focus.

That one man could simultaneously possess such vision and such blindness is intriguing; that his attitudes on race should persist in the culture at large, as they have, tells a troubling story about American society. It is a perspective that schools, universities and libraries should adopt as they celebrate the 250th anniversary of Jefferson's birth today, , for he can be just as instructive about the wounds of racism as the nobility of democracy. And his statements about blacks are rarely taught in history courses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930412","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/12/nyregion/news-summary-933393.html","abstract":"  International A3-13  U.N.

The first composer, Katrina Krimsky, presented standard post-hippie compositional ideas -- a little Indian music, a little jazz, a bit of violin -- and kept the normal concert etiquette, asking the audience to sit still and listen. The second, LaMonte Young, brought a minor sort of ideological framework to his piece. By situating his musicians around the hall, Mr. Young asked the audience to participate in a non-traditional way. In fact, everybody just sat there and listened. Given the general revolution in the relationship between audience and performer wrought by African-American and popular American music, the whole thing seemed more than a bit innocent.   Mr. Young's piece, \"The Melodic Version of the Second Dream of the High-Tension Line Stepdown Transformer,\" part of a longer composition called \"The Four Dreams of China,\" had more to do with the translation of technique into experience than with any sort of musical creativity. Mr. Young has long been interested in the sound of transformers buzzing, and he had his eight trumpeters use mutes to create hums and buzzes. Playing with slight pitch variations, the trumpeters moved from consonance to dissonance; with passive long notes, the musicians allowed the frequencies of the notes to mesh and then jumble up, making clear the subtle interplay of intonations.

Ms. Voigt, a young American soprano, has already achieved acclaim in a variety of roles, including her Ariadne at the Boston Lyric Opera two seasons ago.   Vocally, Ms. Voigt did not disappoint. With an instrument seemingly made for the vast scale of the Met, she poured out rich, lustrous, nuanced tone with ease and security. Dramatically, however, she seemed stiff and uncommunicative, even more ill at ease than might reasonably be expected in Elijah Moshinsky's elephantine new production of the opera.

During a civil war that began with Angola's independence in 1975, Mr. Savimbi insisted that his Unita rebels were democrats thirsting for a chance at the polls to unseat a leftist Government in Luanda. He got his wish last September, but his rival, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, won by a plurality in a generally fair first-round vote that was to be followed by a runoff. But instead of contesting the runoff, Mr. Savimbi resumed fighting, ferociously.    He has been able to do this, as The Times's Kenneth Noble reports, because Unita cheated on cease-fire terms by pretending to demobilize. Western analysts estimate that Mr. Savimbi kept a force of 30,000 to 35,000 soldiers, while the Luanda Government, with three times that number under arms, complied by downsizing its army to 10,000.
