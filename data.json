Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, succeeded in keeping alive the restrictions he has successfully championed since 1977, although they are slightly weaker than those imposed since 1981. But the ultimate fate of Mr. Hyde's amendment is uncertain; the Clinton Administration's budget proposal had no restrictions on abortion financing, and the Senate, which will deal with the issue next, has historically been more sympathetic to abortion rights. Arguments Are Familiar    This issue was debated seriously, if briefly, today for the first time in several years, because supporters of abortion rights had hoped that the changing political climate, including a President who supports abortion rights, would be reflected in the House. But the 255-to-178 vote showed that the House's views on Federal financing of abortions had not changed very much.

The company returned to the festival last week, confirming its solid status as a major American modern-dance company in a program presented at Page Auditorium at Duke University, where the festival is held each summer.    One of the company's greatest strengths is that its 16 performers act as well as they dance. That balance was suggested on Saturday night in the choice of dances on the program, which opened with Dianne McIntyre's \"Take Off From a Forced Landing,\" the story of a family and its dreams, and ended with Talley Beatty's streamlined \"Congo Tango Palace,\" a dance whose urgency is as much an effect of its speed as of its buried emotions.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930701","headline":"Pop and Jazz in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-459693.html","abstract":"  The The Paramount    For stretches of its set on Friday night, the The might almost have been an English blues band.

Mr. Scott, 24 and immensily gifted, seemed almost impatient with the classicism of the mainstream.   The jazz renaissance of the last decade did away with the notion of difficult music in jazz, and \"Behind the Scenes,\" which owed a bit to the more experimental side of Herbie Hancock and later Hampton Hawes (though Mr. Scott is much more referential than either of them), might have been considered abstract by an audience looking to hear the plain mainstream.

Ms. Zahn's carefully constructed one-woman tributes to the Broadway songwriters Charles Strouse, Leonard Bernstein and Carolyn Leigh have earned her a reputation as one of New York's most discriminating cabaret performers. In her new show at Michael's Pub, she has branched out to perform an array of standards by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Jule Styne, Rodgers and Hart, Peter Allen, Jerry Herman and others. She is accompanied by Ben Aronov on piano, Chip Jackson on bass and Ron Zito on drums. Shows are tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. There is a $20 cover charge and a two-drink minimum.

Ms. Horn, who is 48, about the same age as Anselm Kiefer and other German Neo-Expressionists, is a regular in the big international art shows like Documenta, the Venice Biennale and the Carnegie International, where she won the 1988 Carnegie Prize for an installation work titled \"The Hyra Forest/Performing: Oscar Wilde.\" The year before, at an exhibition of site-specific sculpture organized in and around Munster, Germany (near Cologne), she took over the ruin of a medieval dungeon that might have served the Gestapo, and used small lights and mechanized hammers to convey the unsettling suggestion that the structure still held prisoners trying to chip their way to freedom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930702","headline":"Pentagon Pinocchios","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/02/opinion/pentagon-pinocchios.html","abstract":"  The 1980's were the go-go years at the Pentagon, and that meant anything goes, including lying to Congress.

Retirees under these other plans pay income tax on the part of their benefit that exceeds what they paid in.

Of the four operas by Richard Strauss presented here, \"Salome\" and \"Der Rosenkavalier\" are masterpieces from the composer's heyday, and \"Capriccio\" and \"Daphne\" are lesser-known but musically undiminished works from the dusk of a 70-year career. The balance of early and late, famous and obscure, show the breadth of the composer's achievement.   Strauss's works after \"Der Rosenkavalier\" should no longer be dismissed as instances of stylistic confusion or regression. His loose manipulations of tonality, his experiments with \"real life\" opera and erudite eclecticism, now seem ahead of their time, not behind it.

Murphy's challenge to pending Federal family preservation legislation (Op-Ed, June 19) masks an insensitive assault on poor families who struggle to contend with inadequate housing, insufficient employment opportunities and the unavailability of decent child care. As Mr. Murphy has done repeatedly in Illinois, he argues from a handful of horror stories about families who have brutalized their children, concluding that family preservation dollars spent on parents charged with neglecting or abusing their children is wasted money.   Yet Mr. Murphy's tales bear little resemblance to the vast majority of families who face state intervention based on charges that they have failed to take proper care of their children. Most of the parents who populate the halls of our country's juvenile courts are not child abusers, but individuals who have been charged with \"inadequate supervision\" or \"environmental neglect,\" and who have fallen short of society's high standards in their struggle to feed, clothe and house their families on pitifully inadequate resources.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930703","headline":"In Brooklyn, Guarded Optimism","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/03/world/in-brooklyn-guarded-optimism.html","abstract":"  Inside the small offices of the Caribbean Air Mail on Church Avenue in Brooklyn, a constant flow of Haitians poured in and lined up yesterday, waiting to wire money to relatives in Haiti.
