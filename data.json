It is impossible to excuse the agency's -- and the manufacturer's -- failure to detect and correct the problem much earlier.   It no doubt comes as a shock to most travelers to find that the F.A.A. requires manufacturers to design planes to fly through tiny water droplets in clouds, but not through the larger droplets of freezing drizzle or freezing rain. The rationale is that experience indicated that freezing rain was not a serious hazard. Big jets flying above the weather do not encounter the larger droplets. At lower altitudes, conditions that create such droplets can be forecast, and pilots warned to avoid them.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Building A Ballet Of Bodies And Space","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/arts/dance-review-building-a-ballet-of-bodies-and-space.html","abstract":"  \"Ogive,\" Eliot Feld's fourth new ballet for his company's current season, shares the nostalgic perfume that wafts through his other recent works to French music.

Turkey contends its only purpose is to destroy a violent separatist group by wiping out its Iraqi base camps. But sending troops across another nation's border is a violation of international law that deserves harsh condemnation. The world would become even more dangerous if countries with strong armies and border frustrations felt free to take the law into their own hands.   France, which currently leads the European Union, a group Turkey desperately wants to join, has rightly condemned this invasion. The United States should have condemned it too. Instead, Washington, along with Moscow, has expressed understanding for the Turkish attack.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"What Made the Dollar Swoon?

People looked at him, they saw someone else. Here he was, doing Arnold Palmer's whirlybird, out-of-balance finish. There he was, a pile of golf balls bulging from the front of his shirt, doing Craig Stadler.   When they heard him, it was always someone else as well. Seve Ballesteros or Chi Chi Rodriguez. The lead singer of the rock band Jake Trout and the Flounders was another of his impersonations. He could do everybody.   This year, Peter Jacobsen has added another golfer to his repertory. It is by far his best impression yet. It is of a 40-year-old reborn player, a pretty long hitter and great iron player who has become a short- game wizard, a personable guy who interacts with the galleries, laughs at bad breaks and acts the same way whether he's shooting 75 or 65.   Peter Jacobsen is doing . . . Peter Jacobsen. And what an act it is. A man who had won four tournaments in his career has already won half that many this year. And he has a tie for second and a third-place finish as well. He has won more money in three months ($690,351) than he did in any of his previous 18 individual seasons. Always a good player, Jacobsen is now borderline great.   Put it this way: the $3 million Players Championship gets under way Thursday at the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass with a luminous array of golfing talent -- a field that includes the top 36 ranked players in the world -- and Jacobsen has to be considered one of the favorites. He no longer has to do Nick Price or Greg Norman or Nick Faldo or Ernie Els. He now has the game to think about beating them.   Jacobsen is the leading money- winner on tour, the leading all- round player, No. 1 in four statistical categories and certainly among the favorites. And he is exactly the same person in every way but one. For the first time in his career, he has developed a short game. For someone whose touch was always impeccable when it came to the nuances of an impression -- he would always have the telling little raise of the eyebrow or the habitual movement down cold -- he had no real touch around the greens. Last year he finally broke down and visited the short-game guru Dave Pelz in Boca Raton, Fla.   \"I think we're all a little hard-headed,\" Jacobsen said. \"We don't realize our shortcomings, our weaknesses. I realized after all these years of playing golf and looking at all my stats that my putting and chipping were always somewhere near the back.\"   This is the concrete answer. All the intangibles like confidence, self-assurance, rededication, they all come from an ability to get the ball in the hole. And that is something Jacobsen is doing better now than at any time in his life. A quick analysis of his statistics today versus last year at this time is revealing: he has added 10 yards of distance to his drives, averaging 269.7 this year; he is ranked first in greens in regulation compared with 53d; he is using his length and his touch to birdie more par 5's, ranking third in that department compared with 65th last year.   \"Peter is getting closer and closer,\" Pelz said. \"For years he had been focusing on mechanics in the short game. Now he is focusing his mind's eye on speed and touch. I'll tell you, if you put Tom Kite's short game on Peter Jacobsen, you'd have the best player in the world.\"   What you have right now is one of the best-liked players in the world. Jacobsen was always amiable enough, and that has broadened and developed into a comedic on-course demeanor that reaches out and embraces galleries. It stems from something his father told him just before he died in 1992, when Peter asked him what was the most important thing about golf, the setup or the grip or tempo.   \"He looked at me and said, 'Peter, it's a sense of humor,' \" Jacobsen said.   That is one thing that always came naturally to Jacobsen. Now, with the work on the one thing that didn't, he has become a complete player. CHIP SHOTS    The heads of five of the world's leading professional golf organizations met here Wednesday to discuss existing international competitions and to map out plans for something that could eventually resemble a world tour. . . . . ARNOLD PALMER was named as the captain of the United States team for the 1996 Presidents Cup. DAVID GRAHAM will again be the captain of the International team.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Japanese Police Find Chemicals And Gas Masks at Sect's Offices","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/world/terror-tokyo-overview-japanese-police-find-chemicals-gas-masks-sect-s-offices.html","abstract":"  A police search of a religious sect's training compound on Wednesday turned up about two tons of chemicals, including some similar to those used in the nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, the police said today.

This concerns the situation in which a player has to guess which opponent has a crucial queen and states that a defender who plays instantaneously when the suit is led probably has the queen while a player who plays sluggishly probably does not. This has a sound psychological basis: the player who has the queen is likely to be paying careful attention, while his partner may be wool-gathering.   The author of the law was Sol Seidman, a Brooklyn bridge expert who died of pneumonia on March 5 at age 85. He gave much service to the game, particularly to the appeals committees at national championships, which he headed for many years, and to the Greater New York Bridge Association, which he assisted in many capacities.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950323","headline":"Rail Gunman To Spend Life Behind Bars","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/nyregion/rail-gunman-to-spend-life-behind-bars.html","abstract":"  A judge sentenced Colin Ferguson today to spend the rest of his life in prison for the murder of 6 people on the Long Island Rail Road and the attempted murder of 19 others.

The screens are about 8 inches long and 1.75 inches high, and can accommodate two 40-character lines of text. The $2 million system will be installed during the summer and will be used at all performances beginning next season.   Titling has been a matter of considerable dispute at the Met, one of the last major opera houses to resist simultaneous translation. James Levine, the company's artistic director, has said that supertitles would be used \"over my dead body,\" and in a news conference after the demonstration, both Mr. Levine and Joseph Volpe, the company's general manager, reasserted their opposition in principle to translations. But they added that their strongest objection was to projected titles, which they said interfere with the stage action and also disturb those who prefer not to use translations.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Fencing Off the Women's Conference","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/opinion/fencing-off-the-women-s-conference.html","abstract":"  The United Nations Secretariat is tarnishing a forthcoming conference on women's issues by denying credentials to a slew of non-governmental organizations, possibly more than 200, without explaining why. The action has bred suspicion that the Secretariat is responding to political pressures from the conference's Chinese hosts or such powerful participants as the Vatican.   In several instances, the denials resulted from direct pressure. The Chinese, who were eager to have Beijing as the conference site, pledged that the forum would be open to all relevant non-governmental as well as governmental groups. However, they asked, and got, the U.N. to deny credentials to women's organizations from Taiwan and Tibet, their political adversaries. The Vatican does not want to hear from Catholics critical of the church's views on family life and abortion.

First there was the early hoopla when the museum identified the artists to be included and even showed slides of their works. Then came the inevitable backlash, the published lists of those neglected, the complaints about the ones chosen: that there aren't enough young and hip artists, that there is too much painting and not enough Conceptual and political art, that some artists are too well known, others are completely unknown and a few are just friends of the exhibition's curator, Klaus Kertess. Critics agreed about only one point: that the 1995 biennial isn't like the politically top-heavy 1993 show.   Biennials are the art world's Rorschach tests. They are what you bring to them. I like this one, despite the eccentric and occasionally pallid choices Mr. Kertess has made. The show, which opened yesterday, is low key.

When Ernst Paul Fuchs (Michel Piccoli), a distinguished obstetrician in Czechoslovakia, impulsively marries his German maid, Martha (Marianne Saegebrecht), his three sisters are outraged that he should marry a gentile from a lower class. It is the mid-1930's, and Ernst, revered as \"the doctor with the golden hands,\" lives in a mining town near the German border. Although Nazism is on the rise, Ernst, who is Jewish but calls himself a freethinker, senses no threat.

And this impulse is vividly underscored by Ronald Hayman's magisterial new biography, a biography that not only explicates the many intimate correspondences between Mann and his own heroes but that also demonstrates just how minutely the overarching themes of his work -- art, death and illness -- remained rooted in his own emotional and familial conflicts.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Montana Cuts Homosexual Acts From List of Registered Crimes","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/us/montana-cuts-homosexual-acts-from-list-of-registered-crimes.html","abstract":"  Feeling political heat from around the state and the country, the Montana Senate executed an about-face yesterday, deleting homosexual acts from a list of crimes for which convicts must be registered their entire lives.

The abandonment of the voting booth last November by the majority of voters washed in a band of political opportunists who seem determined to exploit fears and plunder resources allocated to the poor, the young and the aged.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/nyregion/c-corrections-182395.html","abstract":"  Because of an editing error, a report yesterday in the Daily Briefing column in New Jersey copies about a lawsuit involving Jersey City layoffs misstated the location of the Federal District Court.

But over all, he argued, such programs have greatly benefited American society since the mid-1960's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Trade Won't Make Cuba More Democratic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/opinion/l-trade-won-t-make-cuba-more-democratic-212995.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Re \"Cuba: Time to Change Direction\" (editorial, March 19): The claim that trade and contact will bring about the end of the Castro regime ignores facts that make the argument inapplicable to Cuba.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950324","headline":"Head of Detroit White Supremacist Group Faces Trial in Canada","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/us/head-of-detroit-white-supremacist-group-faces-trial-in-canada.html","abstract":"  The leader and founder of a white supremacist music and publishing network based in Detroit is scheduled to go on trial in Ottawa soon, charged with aggravated assault in a 1993 melee between white-power supporters and anti-racist demonstrators.

Though Mr. Grey and Mr. Moody represent different eras and radically different sensibilities, what they have in common is authority and wit. They also share the ability to bring an audience into their inventions, to show them exactly what their improvisations are for and what they mean.   Mr. Grey, who is 69, shared the front line of his band with the trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison and the saxophonist Jerome Richardson on Tuesday night, and together they performed five blues compositions and a few standards. Their swing language, precise and edited, almost surreally exact in improvisation, is so laden with blues ideas that even the standards ended up being blues. Mr. Edison's version of \"Lover Man,\" filled with bent blues notes and sharply articulated riffs, was a reminder of how rich the swing vocabulary was and how much has been lost conceptually.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"BRIEFCASE : International Alliance In Mutual Fund Industry","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/your-money/IHT-briefcase-international-alliance-in-mutual-fund-industry.html","abstract":"The mutual fund industry took an important step toward becoming genuinely international this week with the announcement of the alliance between the American fund manager Massachusetts Financial Services, Hypo Bank of Germany and the British fund manager F","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"Broadway Robbery","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/opinion/broadway-robbery.html","abstract":"  Why do tickets for a Broadway show cost $75?

Mr. Redman, the hottest of jazz's hot young saxophonists, produced his best improvisation of the set, a brazenly imaginative solo that rattled around from register to register, set up contrasts, and seemed strikingly open to the idea that all sound could be incorporated into a swinging context. That sort of improvising is why Mr. Redman's reputation is as exalted as it is: at times he fulfills his promise.   Much of the rest of the set, however, seemed stillborn. Mr. Redman is breaking in a new band -- Peter Martin on piano, Chris Thomas on bass and Brian Blade on drums -- that hasn't yet picked up a personality. The musicians never went beyond the functional, and formally there wasn't much sense of play. Even the normally buoyant and inspired Mr. Redman seemed merely enthusiastic. His improvisations, even on a bad night, are graceful, loping with occasional crashes into a lower register blues phrase. He has been cultivating his upper register, and on most solos on Tuesday he found himself in the zone beyond the natural range of the instrument, drawing lines that seemed less precise or reliant on a specific pitch. They seemed metaphorical.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"Yesterday in Washington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/us/diary-yesterday-in-washington.html","abstract":"  TAX CUTS -- Agitation over the Republicans' promised tax cuts broadened as dozens of moderate House Republicans, joined by 23 Democrats who have consistently voted with the majority, demanded that the cuts be delayed until it was clear how they would be paid for. Earlier in the week, 102 Republicans in the House broke ranks with the leadership on the proposed $500 tax credit for families with children. The combined developments suggest trouble for Speaker Newt Gingrich. SPENDING CUTS -- The Senate Appropriations Committee slashed $13 billion from hundreds of Federal programs as a way to reduce the budget deficit and pay for disaster aid to California. The measure cleared the committee by unanimous consent after Democrats agreed to hold their amendments, and their rancor, for the Senate floor.  WELFARE REFORM -- The House approved one of the most important items on the Republican agenda, a measure to undo six decades of Federal social-welfare legislation. The vote, almost entirely on party lines, was 234 to 199. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION -- The Senate voted to repeal a communications tax break intended to bolster minority ownership of cable and broadcast companies. The repeal, passed on a voice vote, is a blow to the entertainment giant Viacom Inc. The company's plan to use the 17-year-old tax break to defer nearly $500 million in Federal taxes on the sale of its cable systems propelled the provision into the spotlight. On another issue, Deval Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, told a House panel: \"This Administration is committed to the goal of expanding opportunity for all Americans in education, employment and the economy generally. There will be no retreat from that commitment.\" The White House is reviewing affirmative action plans.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950325","headline":"British-American Strains","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/opinion/british-american-strains.html","abstract":"  When Prime Minister John Major of Britain refuses for days to take a call from President Clinton, divisions between Washington and London are getting serious.

Clearly there is still residual affection between London and Washington, born of a common language and a camaraderie that dates from World War II. But the end of the cold war has changed what was once a fairly simple equation, much as it has altered America's relationship with the rest of its allies.

Zagata, the new Commissioner for Environmental Conservation, says the state should begin telling people that if they want cleaner air and water, they must pay more of the bill.    \"We've got to start educating the public about the fact that some of the burden for getting the last increment that's left is going to shift from industry to the consumer,\" he said in an interview after his confirmation by the State Senate on Monday. \"We have not done a good job of that, and that's why I think you're seeing a revolt.\"    That revolt, he said, is being led by ordinary citizens who object to paying more for cleaner-burning gasoline and cleaner-running cars, for public purchases of scenic land and the cleanup of toxic waste on industrial sites. He said that if people do not want to pay, they must understand that making industry foot the bill will hurt the economy.    \"Do we want to say, 'Industry, you're going to have to clean up even though it's a 200-to-1 higher cost,' and run the risk of driving industry out of the state?\" he asked.    In his quest to balance economic interests with environmental ones, Mr. Zagata reflects the dual -- critics would say contradictory -- mission of Gov. George E. Pataki. The Governor has won plaudits from environmentalists, but also campaigned last year to reduce regulation, often citing the Department of Environmental Conservation as a prime example of burdensome bureaucracy. Mr. Pataki now wants Mr. Zagata to satisfy both sides: be less onerous to industry without being less vigilant about pollution.    Without offering details, Mr. Zagata said he envisioned a variety of policies to reverse his agency's reputation for punishing companies rather than working with them to solve environmental problems.    He said he would establish programs to educate companies about regulations so arcane that \"the way a piece of paper is filed\" can be a violation. He would require inspectors to perform their work in fewer visits to avoid \"interrupting production.\" He would speed issuance of pollution and building permits.    And he would give companies more opportunities to correct pollution problems before the state takes enforcement action. To do that, he would have inspectors perform \"environmental audits\" that inform companies about possible pollution violations. Six months later, another team of inspectors would review whether the company had taken steps to reverse those problems. If steps were taken, no fines or penalties would be levied.    \"For the last several years, the appearance has been that our mission has been enforcement rather than compliance,\" he said.     But Mr. Zagata said he did not want the agency to be all carrots and no sticks. \"Enforcement is definitely a tool in my bag of tricks,\" he told a State Senate committee on Monday.    Mr. Zagata cites economic issues in suggesting that he might change the department's direction on other matters. He questioned whether the state should continue plans to centralize its auto-inspection system and to require that 2 percent of all new cars offered for sale by 1998 be electric-powered. He voiced concerns about whether the state should buy more land in the Adirondacks, saying he did not want to hurt local towns by reducing their tax bases.    And he said that any plan to protect New York City's watershed must not harm the economies of watershed towns, criticizing city officials for \"walking away from the table\" during negotiations with those towns.     Mr. Zagata's comments have already infuriated some environmentalists. Lee Wasserman, executive director of Environmental Advocates, a nonprofit group, said Mr. Zagata's policies mean polluters \"will get one free bite at the apple.\" Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly Environmental Committee, attacked Mr. Zagata for allowing Mr. Pataki to make budget cuts that he said would gut the agency's enforcement abilities.    Mr. Zagata, 52, is a native New Yorker who speaks with a Texas twang developed during 14 years working as an environmental manager in Houston for oil and natural gas companies. There, he pioneered a concept known as mitigation banking, which allows companies to earn permits for building on protected wetlands by first expanding existing wetlands. He said he planned a similar policy for New York State, starting with state highway projects.    In 1994, he lost his job as vice president of environmental affairs for Transco Energy during a corporate downsizing, and was hired by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to be the Environmental Conservation Department's liaison to business.    He holds a doctorate in wildlife ecology, has worked as a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society and has taught wildlife resources at the University of Maine.    Born in the tiny rural town of West Davenport, Mr. Zagata is an outdoorsman whose office walls are hung with photographs of him hunting and fishing. Though he is only 5 feet 8 inches tall, he is a former football tackle who clearly takes some pride in his toughness.    He recalls, for instance, being rapped on the knuckles by his parochial-school teachers whenever he wrote left-handed. Today, Mr. Zagata remains a proud and unrepentant southpaw with a pen.    \"Every time they hit me, I'd go home and practice with my left hand,\" he recalled with a smile.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950325","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/nyregion/c-corrections-556095.html","abstract":"  A chart in Business Day on Thursday with an article about a new low-sugar cola announced by the Pepsi-Cola Company carried an erroneous scale.

The entire opera took place between the decaying walls of a classical mansion designed by John Conklin, with draped statues and crates, a leafless tree, empty picture frames and creaky scaffolding. There was no outside or inside, only a disintegrating world on the verge of abandonment.

Last year, under pressure from the Casino Control Commission, all casinos complied.
