The film that accomplishes this, Daniel Suter's \"Square of Light,\" comes from Switzerland and lasts less than five minutes. But with splaying crayon flashes, splats and swirls, synchronized with a soundtrack of thuds and crowd noises that vibrates with the dizzying sense of someone going in and out of consciousness, the film evokes brutal physical contact with a startling intimacy.   \"The Square of Light\" is one of several dazzling short films that make \"The 24th International Tournee of Animation,\" a 14-part survey of artists and styles, well worth a look. Like previous anthologies in the series, this one, which opens today at the Angelika Film Center in Greenwich Village, casts a wide stylistic net. You will find everything from latter-day descendants of \"The Flintstones\" and prehistoric cousins of the dinosaurs in \"Jurassic Park\" to a thoughtful Eastern European surrealism.

The goons who set this story in motion hold court in an amusement park, where they randomly engage in drunken, violent outbursts. It's some measure of this film's tumultuousness that Andrei (Andrei Goutine), the brutish central character, takes solitary rides on a roller coaster in order to collect his thoughts and calm down.   The roller coaster is used to suggest the wild, breakneck trajectory of a society gone out of control, which gives \"Luna Park\" some common ground with Mr. Lounguine's earlier \"Taxi Blues.\" Once again, the film maker offers a startlingly vivid cross-section of a crumbling Russia, and strikes sparks off the relationship between an angry, musclebound anti-Semite and a dissipated Jewish musician.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"Seles Attacker to Face a New Trial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/sports/sports-people-tennis-seles-attacker-to-face-a-new-trial.html","abstract":"  The man who stabbed MONICA SELES is likely to go on trial again but no date for the proceedings has been set, judicial sources in Hamburg, Germany, said yesterday.

First, Government service has become largely reactive rather than creative. Political debate is sharper and commentary often personally vicious in the wake of such divisive issues as Vietnam, Watergate, the civil rights movement, the retreat into ethnocentrism and the multifaceted sexual revolution.

It was an orgy of eating in which men sat in large halls, unhindered by such niceties as knives, forks or napkins, devouring massive amounts of meat and washing it down with pitchers of beer.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940121","headline":"A Danish 'Schindler'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/21/opinion/l-a-danish-schindler-941964.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   A Danish \"Schindler\" (letter, Jan. 12) has indeed been made. \"A Day in October\" tells the inspiring story of the rescue of 7,200 Danish Jews through the plight of a middle-class Jewish family living in Copenhagen in October 1943.

The show includes drawings for feminist cartoons like Lynda Barry's \"God's Gift\" and Jennifer Camper's \"If Men Got Pregnant.\" It has a reading area with books like \"The Four Elements,\" by Roz Chast, \"Bad Girls Do It: An Encyclopedia of Female Murderers,\" by Michael Newton, and the comic book anthology \"Twisted Sisters: A Collection of Bad Girl Art.\"    Visitors can sit on chairs designed by the artist Nancy Dwyer, don earphones and listen to an eclectic mix of blues, rock, rap, folk and opera music -- often parodistic and always full of sexual innuendo and feminist subversiveness -- that starts with Bessie Smith's \"I Ain't Gonna Play No Second Fiddle\" of 1925. At the show's entrance, \"Marge on the Lam,\" a Thelma-and-Louise-type segment from Matt Groening's popular television show \"The Simpsons,\" plays nonstop on a monitor. In the final gallery, a selection of generally entertaining videotapes, organized by Cheryl Dunye, treats such subjects as sexual harrassment, lesbianism, the Beatles and even cheerleading with wit and ingenuity. Viewers may also read wall texts printed with jokes that a stand-up female comic, albeit a not-too-talented one, might use. (Sample: \"You're less apt to be a bad girl if . . . you think wrist corsages are O.K.\") A sprinkling of work by male artists demonstrates how feminism has infiltrated the art activities of the opposite sex.

We arrived by bus from Badgastein on a beautiful sun-filled day. Although it was early in the season, snow conditions above the chairlift, aided by grooming, were the best in the valley. The ride on the Kreuzkogellift was exhilarating and the alpine scene from the peak was the most spectacular in the valley. We enjoyed a hot lunch at midstation in a modern cafeteria, using precisely the method the author described, ordering via the attractive photos of the selections.   The author missed the skiing highlight of Sportgastein, the Heilstollen. Departing from the backside of the mountain, this eight-mile descent brings the hardy skier to a bus stop on the mountain road between Badgastein and Sportgastein.

In THE BRONTES AT HAWORTH: The World Within (Clarkson Potter, $30), Juliet Gardiner adeptly chronicles both the outer world of the grim Yorkshire town of Haworth, where the Bronte children spent most of their lives with their highly educated but eccentric father, the Rev. Patrick Bronte, and the inner world of the imagination to which each sibling turned, first in childhood and then throughout adulthood, for solace in the wake of relentless tragedy. As young children, they witnessed the sudden deaths of their mother and then of their two oldest sisters, Maria and Elizabeth. In the years that followed, with the exception of brief forays at schools, a few trips, scattered attempts at positions outside of Haworth and Charlotte's marriage only a few months before her death at the age of 38, the Bronte siblings spent their time cloistered on the one hand by the secluded atmosphere of their father's austerely furnished parsonage, and surrounded on the other by the vast, windswept expanse of the Yorkshire moors. All four children conjured fantastical characters and kingdoms in miniature \"novels,\" diaries, poems and mock newspapers -- so-called juvenilia that would put many adult writers to shame. Ms. Gardiner, the author of \"The People's War\" and \"Over Here: The G.I.'s in Wartime Britain,\" quotes generously from these documents, as well as from the Bronte sisters' novels, family letters and Elizabeth Gaskell's classic biography of Charlotte Bronte. The books also include fascinating drawings and watercolors by the multitalented family.

Many Caribbean islands have white sand, aquamarine seas and lush mountains, but few display luxury goods in such abundance. A commercial hub long before Blackbeard prowled its waters, St. Thomas is now a prime destination for cruise ships, whose passengers rush ashore -- quite in the spirit of 18th-century buccaneers -- in pursuit of duty-free booty.    Others still come to get away from it all, even if a wave of development that followed Hurricane Hugo in 1989 sometimes gives a jolt of urban American reality.

The sidewalks and narrow alleys of downtown Charlotte Amalie (pronounced ah-MAHL-ya), the territorial capital and St. Thomas's only real town, prove that there can be gridlock in paradise.  Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas's first permanent European settlement, dates from 1671. Set on a grand circular harbor, the town was laid out by planners in Denmark who had never seen the mountainous, 32-square-mile island, and it has kept much of its colonial charm.

The tenants will include a currency exchange, a pizzeria, a coin laundry and Saverama, a variety store. The developer, Broadway Bushwick Builders, is also negotiating with other possible tenants, including Rainbow Shops, a national clothing chain, and Blimpie's, the fast-food chain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Port Authority's Homeless Policy Called a Success","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/nyregion/port-authority-s-homeless-policy-called-a-success.html","abstract":"  THE prolonged cold and icy weather lingering in the metropolitan area has sent hundreds of homeless people searching for warmth in bus, train and airport terminals operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The area was christened in the 1880's, when journalists were touting Florida as the Italy of America -- a restorative land offering sun, joie de vivre and superlativefishing. And Naples, like its sister city, nestles on an inland bay along the western flank of a large land mass. To those who have vacationed on Florida's Atlantic coast, this affluent resort community that swells to 33,000 in peak season may seem an oddity.  The fine sand, like confectioner's sugar, is the first thing one notices. Its origins are somewhat less than romantic, however, the waste produced by coral-eating fish having played a prominent role. Then too, the Everglades are close at hand -- a 40-minute drive -- giving Naples that clearing-on-the-edge-of-the-backwoods feel, particularly if one approaches from Alligator Alley, the highway crossing the state from Fort Lauderdale.

Steven Spielberg: idiot savant or misguided bar mitzvah boy? More than a month after its release, \"Schindler's List\" is drawing large audiences and touching them deeply, but among critics and commentators it is still struggling to shake off the burden of being a Spielberg movie. Early reviews were nearly unanimous raves, but a sneaky condescension showed through. The wonder, these rapturous reviews hinted, was not that a powerful film had been made about the Holocaust but that Peter Pan had made it.    It took a few weeks for the backlash to set in, as the discussion moved from the entertainment pages to the op-ed pages and talk shows. The old Spielberg rap -- too entertaining for his own good -- came back to haunt him. Why did he make a movie about a righteous Nazi? this argument goes. Why did he make a movie about survival when the Holocaust was about death? If you read and listen enough, it will appear that you can't see \"Schindler\" without seeing Spielberg.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940123","headline":"Lauren S. Cahn, Eric S.
