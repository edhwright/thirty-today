His delicate, densely crosshatched ink drawings, suggestive of 19th-century engravings and ironic story-book texts meld into a singular sensibility: gothic, yes, but without a hint of the genre's hysteria.   In fact, the most disturbing element of Mr. Gorey's work is its cool acceptance of all things horrific. \"With God almighty being flighty and absent frequently,\" as Mr. Gorey writes, these witty novels in miniature tend less to build to climaxes than to trail off into existential ellipses, leaving a final impression of forbidding stillness. They are not the sort of thing, one would think, that would naturally lend themselves to the songs and punch lines of musical comedy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"Who'll Defend the Persecuted Smoker?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/opinion/l-who-ll-defend-the-persecuted-smoker-807583.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Am I the only nonsmoker who is shocked and fearful that our freedom is threatened by a government powerful enough to consider laws that ban smoking even more than it is banned now?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"Review/Television; Erik and Lyle, The Year's Stand-Ins For Amy and Joey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/arts/review-television-erik-and-lyle-the-year-s-stand-ins-for-amy-and-joey.html","abstract":"  The Menendez brothers are back, and Fox has got them, at least for the tonight-at-8 moment. Next month, CBS will have a four-hour movie about Erik and Lyle, the weepy young men whose first California trial for the murder of their wealthy parents was a hit, televised live, on Court TV. After hung juries, a second trial seems inevitable. Television entertainment, desperately looking for this year's equivalent of Amy and Joey, couldn't care less. Justice be damned. Just cash in fast on the sensationalism while it's hot.    Fox's \"Honor Thy Father and Mother,\" wistfully subtitled \"The True Story of the Menendez Murders,\" is a typical exercise in television docudrama, replete with warnings about composite characters and compressed time sequences. The script is based on public records, meaning the trial itself and newspaper accounts, and on the book \"Blood Brothers,\" by John Johnson and Ronald L. Soble, Los Angeles Times reporters who covered the case.

Just as \"Capriccio\" wages a war of ascendancy between words and music, so \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday night, lets classical drama and low comedy go 10 rounds to a draw.   Both conflicts are fought on the neutral ground of centuries-old opulence. Bewigged aristocracy serves as referee with liveried servants as discreet seconds. Sequestered from the present, these debates allow Strauss a languid bemusement, a condescending affection toward the heated questions of art his characters personify.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"CUNY to Train Recruits For Police in Puerto Rico","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/nyregion/cuny-to-train-recruits-for-police-in-puerto-rico.html","abstract":"  Tomorrow, almost 900 students will begin their first day of classes in a new City University of New York program to train police officers and confer on them an associate degree in police science.

The band, which mixes aboriginal music from Australia with various international pop styles, performs in aboriginal outfits. The band members come out, bodies painted, playing sticks and didgeridoos. They perform a short set of tribal music, unaccompanied. And they do traditional dances. Inadvertently, their shows become a type of ethnic spectacle.   Their music deserves more of a response. The band, from northeastern Australia, has recently released a new album, \"Freedom\" (Hollywood), and can get a real rock momentum going. Its blend, where a didgeridoo, gutturally repeating a few notes, anchors the bottom end of the music and the clanging of hard wooden sticks sifts in and out of bass, guitar and keyboards, offers a beautiful musical vision of cultures in flux.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940418","headline":"Sports of The Times; This Hextall Joins Ranger History Books","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/18/sports/sports-of-the-times-this-hextall-joins-ranger-history-books.html","abstract":"  HIS family name already resides in the New York Rangers' record book: winning goal in 1940 Stanley Cup final game -- Bryan Hextall Sr.    His grandfather scored the last cup-winning goal in Ranger history.

The legal and ethical uncertainties surrounding ticket resales have long confounded lawmakers, entertainment producers and consumers alike, but the two lawsuits take advantage of one of the few unambiguous points of law: New York State restricts the price at which a broker can resell a ticket to $5 or 10 percent above its face value, whichever is greater.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940419","headline":"U.S. Diplomat's Speech on Extremism in Germany Stirs Storm","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/19/world/us-diplomat-s-speech-on-extremism-in-germany-stirs-storm.html","abstract":"  An unusually frank speech by a senior American diplomat about right-wing extremism in Germany has stirred a tempest here.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), this Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment governs the exercise of peremptory challenges by a prosecutor in a criminal trial. The Court explained that although a defendant has \"no right to a 'petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race,' \" . . . the \"defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria.\" Since Batson, we have reaffirmed repeatedly our commitment to jury selection procedures that are fair and nondiscriminatory. We have recognized that whether the trial is criminal or civil, potential jurors, as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to jury selection procedures that are free from state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice. . . .","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940420","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/nyregion/news-summary-834181.html","abstract":"  International A3-13  SOUTH AFRICA BOYCOTT CANCELED  Zulu nationalist leaders in South Africa called off a boycott of the first all-race elections, greatly increasing hopes for a peaceful transition to democracy there.

But the orchestra's current tour, in more mundane times, is no mere road trip. It is the Dresden's first visit to the United States with its current music director, Giuseppe Sinopoli; it is also an attempt to reaffirm the orchestra's achievements as it adjusts to life in post-Communist Germany.   So there was a certain gravity to its first concert in Carnegie Hall on Monday night (its second was last night).  The curious thing was that though the Dresden is probably the oldest organized group of musicians in the world, it seemed to be seeking its voice. In fact, under Mr. Sinopoli's direction the orchestra sounded much less experienced and coherent than either the Vienna or the Berlin Philharmonic, merely striplings by comparison, which have also passed through town in recent months.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940420","headline":"Frenchman Convicted of Crimes Against the Jews in '44","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/world/frenchman-convicted-of-crimes-against-the-jews-in-44.html","abstract":"  Almost 50 years after he ordered the execution of seven Jews while he was serving in a pro-Nazi militia, Paul Touvier today became the first Frenchman to be found guilty of crimes against humanity during World War II.
