Blatantly manipulative, this playwright isn't averse to withholding crucial facts about his characters until the last minute. If his stacking of his narrative decks seems like cheating, the payoffs are usually worth the chicanery.   \"Three Viewings,\" at Manhattan Theater Club, consists of three monologues, each delivered by a different character in the same funeral parlor in a small town outside Pittsburgh. In the sharpest one, \"The Thief of Tears,\" Margaret Whitton plays a tough cookie named Mac who flies from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh for the funeral of her rich, tyrannical grandmother. \"Thirteen Things About Ed Carpolotti\" finds Virginia (Penny Fuller), the middle-aged widow of a wheeler-dealer with ties to organized crime, in dire straits.

Despite the best efforts of the Republicans to publicize and promote what they call their legislative revolution, the survey suggested that much of the public remained largely disengaged. Only 38 percent said they had read or heard anything about the Contract With America, the Republican policy agenda that has driven the House in these first three months. Forty-seven percent said they were \"mostly disappointed\" with the first 100 days, compared with 39 percent who said they were pleased. And Mr. Gingrich's personal ratings remain remarkably negative.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950406","headline":"Head of Army Forces in the U.S. Is Selected as New Chief of Staff","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/06/us/head-of-army-forces-in-the-us-is-selected-as-new-chief-of-staff.html","abstract":"  President Clinton has selected the head of Army forces in the United States to be the next Army Chief of Staff, senior officials in the Administration said today.

His spare yet ever-expanding vocabulary includes white grid sculptures capable of a nearly Piranesian complexity, and a profusion of wall drawings in pencil and bright ink that have left few geometric stones unturned. These drawings are executed by assistants following written instructions whose fusion of the linguistic, the visual and the philosophical makes them a minor art form in their own right. With Mr. LeWitt's photographs, prints and drawings on paper taken into account, no one except Donald Judd has so thoroughly overturned the notion of the Minimal while remaining true to first principles.   At the moment, three sides of Mr. LeWitt's complex sensibility are visible in exhibitions in SoHo and the South Village, more than Manhattan has seen in some time. A show of enormous sculptures at Ace Gallery New York is buttressed by an exhibition of wall drawings at the Lawrence Markey Gallery and a show of 45 working drawings on paper at the John Weber Gallery, the artist's longtime representative.

The 63-year-old cartoon yokel, who is starring in his first animated feature film, \"A Goofy Movie,\" doesn't have a mean bone in his body. When his teen-age son, Max, sneers at him as the epitome of squareness, Goofy isn't so much indignant as wounded in a droopy, hangdog way.   Goofy and Max have classic generation-gap issues to resolve. Where Goofy's notion of hip is Xavier Cugat, Max worships a strutting hard-rock superstar called Powerline. After Max rudely interrupts a high school assembly to do an impersonation of his idol, the school principal telephones Goofy to warn him that Max is heading for trouble. Goofy's solution is to take his son to Idaho on a fishing trip, during which he hopes they can become buddies.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19950407","headline":"Pathologist Says 5 Children Died of Deliberate Suffocation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/nyregion/pathologist-says-5-children-died-of-deliberate-suffocation.html","abstract":"  Testifying in the trial of a woman charged with killing her five young children, the chief forensic pathologist of the New York State Police said today that all five had been deliberately suffocated and were not, as was originally believed, victims of crib death.

Green has never been a terribly welcome figure in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's City Hall, but yesterday he found himself banned even from a city-owned center for the elderly after the Giuliani administration decided that a forum he planned on the Republican Party's Contract With America was a political activity prohibited on city property.    As a result, Mr. Green and Thomas M. Menino, the Mayor of Boston and a fellow Democrat, met with about 40 older people on the sidewalk yesterday morning at 93d Street and First Avenue, outside the Stanley M. Isaacs Senior Center, which the Housing Authority owns. Afterward, Mr. Green charged that Ruben Franco, the chairman of the Housing Authority, had engaged in \"big-brother censorship.\" But Mr. Franco and Mr. Giuliani said they were only trying to protect the city's Federal housing money.    The dispute began on Wednesday, when Mr. Green notified the Housing Authority that he and six big-city mayors -- all Democrats -- planned to discuss the Contract With America, the Republican policy agenda that has been the focus of the first 100 days of the Congressional session, at the center. A day later, Mr. Franco called the center and said the event was prohibited, citing Housing Authority regulations that say, \"In no case may community center space be used for partisan political activities.\"    Mr. Franco informed Mr. Green as well, but the Public Advocate, a likely mayoral candidate, decided to show up anyway. He and Mr. Menino spent the morning telling older people on the sidewalk how Federal policies will affect them, and then he spent the afternoon telling reporters on the sidewalk outside City Hall about the damage done to the First Amendment.    \"Here we have a city official who is engaging in classic prior restraint because he has decided to ban me from speaking because of his guess about the political content of what we might say,\" said Mr. Green, who was joined by Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.    City officials defended their decision by noting that all the mayors invited to the forum were from the same party, and suggested that only one side of the Contract With America would have been presented.    \"I know the mayors that were here came for a meeting that was sponsored by the Democratic National Committee to raise money,\" said Mr. Giuliani, explaining why the mayors had come to New York in the first place. \"So it would have been very hard to escape the fact that what Mark Green was organizing here was a partisan political event.\"    Mr. Giuliani himself has given the Contract With America mixed reviews, saying that he agrees with parts of it and disagrees with others.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"IN PERFORMANCE: POP","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/arts/in-performance-pop-790095.html","abstract":"  Trumpets and Guitar Over a Tuba's Beat  Spanish Fly   Mercury Lounge","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"Private Offshore Trust Business May Soon Bloom in Dublin","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/your-money/IHT-private-offshore-trust-business-may-soon-bloom-in-dublin.html","abstract":"EUROPE'S fastest-growing offshore financial center may soon be open for business from private investors, if Dublin accountants and lawyers have their way. .The International Financial Services Centre, or IFSC, at Dublin's Custom House Docks has attracte","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"Hockey; Rangers Roll Out a Welcome Mat for the Islanders","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/sports/hockey-rangers-roll-out-a-welcome-mat-for-the-islanders.html","abstract":"  It is becoming increasingly apparent that this might not be another Year of the Rangers.

The candidate, Gina Grant, 19, a high school senior, is a straight-A student, captain of her school tennis team and has taught biology to underprivileged sixth- and seventh-graders in Cambridge, Mass. But in 1990, in what Ms. Grant said was an attempt to defend herself from an alcoholic parent and what prosecutors called a vicious murder, Ms. Grant bludgeoned her mother to death in Lexington, S.C.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950408","headline":"Renewed Repression in Kenya","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/opinion/renewed-repression-in-kenya.html","abstract":"  Kenya's President, Daniel arap Moi, has an easy answer for critics who charge that his Government is corrupt and dictatorial.

The space provides a correct environment for young voices, and Massenet's endearing operatic corruption of Goethe adds just the right music for them. The opera arrived on Wednesday night peopled by singers and players from the Juilliard School and led by Guido Ajmone-Marsan. Mr. Ajmone-Marsan has a good effect on his young pit orchestra, which played not just with competence but also with style and understanding.   Opera has a way of heightening human passions by simplifying relationships. Thus the Edouard Blau libretto embraced by Massenet is about star-crossed love: lovers wrapped in a hopeful embrace that will never really be. Goethe's Werther is more interesting because his life is lived on the inside. He is the ruminating delusionary to whom Albert and Charlotte, a devoted couple, remain loving friends until death. Romantic opera copes poorly with subtleties like this.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950408","headline":"METRO DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/nyregion/metro-digest-760895.html","abstract":"  DEFYING SCHOOL DRIVERS' STRIKE THREAT Pushed by Mayor Rudolph W.
