Vintage International, $11. These stories take place in India, where a retired civil servant recounts the adventures of holy men and courtesans, loveless children and love-struck adults. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hower, said the tales are \"told with skill and sensitivity\" and \"a delight to read.\" DENYING THE HOLOCAUST: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory By Deborah E. Lipstadt. Plume, $10.95. The author examines the arguments of those who insist that the Nazi campaign of  genocide against the Jews never happened, tracing them from the pro-German statements of former isolationists after World War II to \"scholarly\" attempts to debunk the Holocaust in the United States today. It is an \"important and impassioned work,\" Walter Reich said here last year, written \"particularly from  an American perspective.\" Exploring the same problem with a concentration on France is ASSASSINS OF MEMORY: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust, by Pierre  Vidal-Naquet, translated by Jeffrey Mehlman (Columbia University, $15.95). In the same review, Mr. Reich said that this French historian impresses the reader  with his \"intellectual and moral power.\" The historical roots of enmity toward Jews are analyzed in ANTISEMITISM: The Longest Hatred, by Robert S. Wistrich (Schocken, $15), which shows how early Christian prejudice, based on theology, has evolved into a more geopolitical animosity today. It is \"as good a one-volume overview of anti-Semitism as exists in English,\" Mark Silk said here  in 1992. Efforts to remind the world of the victims of Nazi anti-Semitism are the subject of THE TEXTURE OF MEMORY: Holocaust Memorials and Meaning, by James  E. Young (Yale University, $20). The author discusses monuments in Germany, Poland, Israel and the United States, noting how they reflect national identity.

His excellent essay is one of 14 commentaries by artists, critics and collectors that complement the 82-year-old French-born artist's work in LOUISE BOURGEOIS: The Locus of Memory.  Works 1982-1993 (Brooklyn Museum/Abrams, $45). The subtly lighted photographs perfectly render Ms. Bourgeois's luscious yet disquieting forms -- for example,  an array of lotion-pink rubber breasts in \"Mamelles\" (1991) or the odd anemone-like colonies sprouting from sparkling marble in \"Untitled (With Growth)\" (1989). The artist's extraordinary new installations, the \"Cell\" series, are beautifully documented: cubicles of industrial metal fence, rusted and peeling, enclose uncanny assemblages of found objects and finished sculpture, as in \"Cell (Choisy)\" (1990-93), in which a small white marble version of Ms. Bourgeois's family house sits beneath a scale model of a guillotine. The intensely personal nature of Ms. Bourgeois's work, fueled by the artist's deep exploration of her emotions, memories and body, has attracted the  admiration of a wide spectrum of artists and critics; the Minimalist artist Richard Serra and the Conceptualist artists Jenny Holzer and Adrian Piper contribute short statements to the book. Her work is an attempt, as she puts it, \"to give meaning and shape to frustration and suffering.\" It is this quest that  goes beyond the immediate sensory appeal of her sculptures and captivates our sometimes unwilling emotional attention.

Along the way he \"slept rough\" in a bedroll under the stars, kept watch for the infamous \"Beast of Gevaudan,\" a vicious, flesh-eating wolf-man first sighted in the area in 1764, ruminated on subjects like love, history and religious tolerance, and took notes for a book published the following spring called \"Travels With a Donkey in the Cevennes.\" \n\n     Ever since I first read that splendid little volume, I have wanted to hike in the Cevennes.

The native Cevenols are rugged, insular people, many of whose Protestant forebears fought the army of the Catholic French crown during the 18th century War of the  Camisards. Today, as then, there are few towns of any size in the Cevennes; gas  stations and grocery stores are rarities, movie theaters nonexistent -- though first-run films are sometimes shown in village halls, a little like traveling circuses.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940731","headline":"TRAVEL ADVISORY;Construction Delays Bradley Airport Traffic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/travel/travel-advisory-construction-delays-bradley-airport-traffic.html","abstract":"Travelers arriving at or departing from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., should allow additional time getting to and from the airport this summer.

Making music against a background of wider artistic, literary and social contexts needs the preparation and thought these events did not receive. This year the festival has lowered its sights. Ideas of time and place remain but in simpler terms. This past week at Avery Fisher Hall, for example, has centered on Mozart's extraordinary outburst of piano concertos in 1784. On Thursday, the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra under Gerard Schwarz offered three of the six. Under Armin Jordan on Friday, a fourth was played.   The concept works: one notes both astonishing variety and shared tendencies. Each of the four was a world to itself, yet in the piano detail and harmonic gestures lay a recognizable mind. The performers were as various as the pieces. All professional pianists learn music's vocabulary of expression, but Helene Grimaud, who played the F-major Concerto (No. 19, K. 459) on Thursday, showed emotions of her own, her heart speaking acutely and specifically with every depression of the keys. Miss Grimaud's quiet playing is especially effective, yet paradoxically, it is slimness of sonority that creates her principal problem: a sound so slight that it almost disappears within the orchestra around her.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940801","headline":"Bosnians Urge Tougher Response to Serb Rejection of Accord","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/01/world/bosnians-urge-tougher-response-to-serb-rejection-of-accord.html","abstract":"  Bosnian Government leaders today criticized the United States and four other major powers for failing to take decisive action against the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting a peace plan.

The report was prepared by the Office of Government Ethics, the main executive branch agency for handling ethics issues, which is staffed by career civil servants.

They probably could have gone to smoke signals and Brown still would have had a good night.   The temporary confusion with the radio -- something teams can use this season to combat crowd noise -- was about the only thing that went wrong for Brown. The Giants lost the game, 20-19, but they may have found peace of mind at the quarterback position.

They are one of the few alternative rock bands that has retrogressed over the years: between their first album and their third, the sound fidelity actually worsens. But this is part of the Grifters' appeal: they are sloppy but artfully so.   When the Grifters performed on Saturday night at CBGB, they sounded as if they had tuned their instruments after drinking themselves silly. The guitars and bass clanged stridently against one another, chasing after impossible harmonies. The band itself was in beautiful disarray: no instrument responded on cue and few notes were in place. The Grifters not only changed the tunes but also the words on their best known discordant rockers, \"She Blows Blasts of Static\" and \"Soda Pop.\" During duets, the guitarists Dave Shouse and Scott Taylor didn't sing together; they simply sang at the same time.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940801","headline":"A Suburban Eden Where the Right Rules","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/01/us/a-suburban-eden-where-the-right-rules.html","abstract":"  It is a long way culturally and politically from Roslyn, L.I., to conservative Cobb County.
