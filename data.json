Sanchez Vicario said she suffered a stretched muscle early in the match, an injury that all but eliminated her service game.  Her Italian opponent broke serve three times in the first set and once in the second. But Sanchez Vicario broke Golarsa four times in the first set and three times in the second. Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina made her first tournament appearance a winning one with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 decision over Lisa Raymond. In a disappointing match for the fans, Helen Kelesi of Canada was beaten, 6-2, 6-3, by 11th-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.

At the outset of Schubert's \"Unfinished\" Symphony, the festival orchestra's principal oboe and clarinet did not seem to be altogether in tune. Paleness of tone plagued all the winds thereafter, and the strings occasionally wavered as well. Gerard Schwarz signaled ambitiously broad pacing from the podium, but a flat, static performance was the result. The opening and closing sections of the first movement held only a hint of Schubert's pervasive mystery and melancholy.   Next, Eugene Istomin came onstage for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, and the situation stayed grim. Mr. Istomin's playing was clattery and uneven, shifting continually toward the loud end of the spectrum; he found the work's tensely reflective tone only in the closing measures of the second movement. Despite wild applause from the capacity audience, which had earlier made its presence felt by dropping dozens of small to medium-size objects on the floor, this performance was not one for the scrapbooks.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Back to School, Bearing Tales of the Flood","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/us/back-to-school-bearing-tales-of-the-flood.html","abstract":"  For a month, nothing has been as it should be for the children in this blue-collar town.

He thrived on the Scriabin Second Sonata and Chopin's Variations on \"La ci darem la mano,\" but seemed more than a little uneasy in Schubert's Impromptus (D. 899) and the Schumann \"Faschingsschwank aus Wien.\"   When Scriabin's florid, ever-moving detail or Schubert's rhythmic left-hand accompaniments locked Mr. Gampel's melodic movement into place, the pianist became a sound interpreter. When confronted with unadorned melody, however, he seemed at a loss. The Intermezzo from the Schumann, for example, is phrased in one dramatic breath: an upward leap and downward swoop toward dissonance and resolution; Mr. Gampel draws back in mid-plunge, totally dismantling the effect. Similar interruptions undid the tensions of the earlier Romance section. Ritards, accelerations and accentuation, in other words, must sound absolutely necessary to a performance.

Instead of Steely Dan's cool, subtle, meticulous, elegantly ironic songs, matching oblique lyrics to harmonically ambiguous jazz chords, the rock mainstream has turned toward noise, simplicity and blunt impact. Where Mr. Becker and Mr. Fagen could agonize for months over perfecting a smooth transition, hip-hop has brought sudden jump-cuts instead.

Will the Blue Jays allow themselves to be caught? Can the American League East even be called a two-team pennant race yet? Maybe, maybe and probably not are the answers to the above questions. They are questions that will linger as the final 40 games of the season are played and the Yankees, Red Sox and maybe the Orioles continue pursuing the Jays. The second-place Yankees, who have not spent even a day alone in first place this season, could be boosted or buried by certain developments as they attempt to slice their two-game gap. Ways to Boost Yanks' Chances ABBOTT AND PEREZ   Significant contributions from Melido Perez and Jim Abbott. The excuses are growing old. Solid starts and games that could have or should have been won by these two underachievers are no longer important, only victories are. With about eight starts each left, both Perez and Abbott need to pitch supremely better than .500 for the Yankees to continue contending. They are a combined 15-21 with a 4.38 e.r.a. after both had e.r.a.'s under 2.90 last season. They need at least 10 victories in their last 16 starts to make their winter bearable. GETTING CLOSER TO A CLOSER   Rob Dibble, Rick Aguilera, Dennis Eckersley and Bryan Harvey. Those intriguing reliever names have been floated and others are likely to follow, but none are likely to float onto the Yankee roster before it is set for post-season play in 11 days. General Manager Gene Michael has been adamant about not trading away prospects so the new-look bullpen with Bob Wickman and Paul Assenmacher in prominent roles could remain intact.  DEPENDING ON DON MATTINGLY   Perhaps this is finally his year, the year when he finally plays in the post-season. Perhaps, but his robust bat cannot stop spraying hits just yet. Enjoying a 53-game splurge that has seen him hit .369 with 12 homers and 54 runs batted in, Mattingly must do more and more. Or, at least more of the same over the final 40 games. ROAD WARRIORS   Playing above .500 on the lonesome road. They have lost 16 of their last 25 on the road. They play 22 of their last 40 on the road. Figure out the statistics and the odds are not good for a stylish conclusion to their road schedule, but it is needed. Starting Monday in Chicago, the Yanks must play better than their .475 percentage and win at least 12 of their last 22 away from home. That includes a journey to Toronto on Sept. 24-26, which they hope will still be meaningful. Ways to Bury Yanks' Chances A SLUMP BY JIMMY KEY   He is the best the Yankees have. He is 15-4 with a league-best 2.83 earned run average and is fighting Jack McDowell for the Cy Young Award. But his glorious season has not been so glorious lately. Key is 3-2 with a 4.47 e.r.a. in his last six starts after surrendering 22 earned runs and 50 hits in 44 1/3 innings. For Jimmy Key, he is struggling. The Yankees need him to regain his form he displayed so consistently for much of the season. A LOSING STREAK AT HOME   The Stadium has been a haven for the Yankees. They have won 30 of their last 40 games in the Bronx and have the second finest home record in the league. That cannot change. The Yankees and Blue Jays have a somewhat similar schedule over the final six weeks, with each playing 22 of their final 40 games onthe road but New York stil has to play the A.L. West-contending White Sox, Royals and Rangers 15 times while Toronto plays the lowly A's and Angels and stumbling Mariners 19 games. OFFENSE PETERS OUT   Mike Stanley and Paul O'Neill have provided the Yankees with timely hits all season. Make that until the last two weeks. Stanley, who could end his season today with the best statistics of his professional life, has no homers, three runs batted in and a .205 average in his last 14 games. Is the grind of the season catching up with the former backup catcher? O'Neill, once second in the league in batting, is 5 for his last 31 to shrink 13 points off his average and lower it to .312. Is .300 still within reach? INJURY TO TARTABULL   Manager Buck Showalter can burn inside about Tartabull playing only one game in the outfield since July 15 because of a shoulder injury, but he should really just be thankful that Tartabull can swing a bat. If Tartabull remains healthy enough to hit, the Yankee lineup remains healthy. Do you think Mattingly's resurgence has anything to do with having Tartabull behind him? Sure it does. Since the last time Tartabull played right field, he has hit nine homers and driven in 32 runs to help the Yankees go 21-11. Ignore that Tartabull is clogging up the designated hitter slot and leave him there.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/nyregion/c-corrections-261793.html","abstract":"  An obituary on Wednesday about Thomas B.

As the first show organized by Ellen Lupton, Cooper-Hewitt's new curator of contemporary design, \"Mechanical Brides\" suggests that the museum is eager to experiment with new curatorial approaches. And that is a very welcome sign. The field of design is in desperate need of fresh perspectives.   Historically, Cooper-Hewitt's mission has been to celebrate design. Its shows have held up objects its curators have found worthy of public esteem.  But, like other arts institutions in recent years, the museum now aspires to take a more critical stance toward its subject matter. That aspiration holds particular significance for a museum of design. If it wants to be more than a trade show for market commodities, a design museum must find effective ways to demonstrate that a curator's role differs from a salesman's.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930820","headline":"Jordan Thanks the Public, but Scolds the News Media for Speculation","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/20/sports/jordan-thanks-the-public-but-scolds-the-news-media-for-speculation.html","abstract":"  In his first public statement since learning last week that his father had been shot to death, Michael Jordan expressed gratitude yesterday for an outpouring of public sympathy, but chided some members of the news media for speculating that the death might have been linked to his own well-publicized gambling activities.   \"Throughout this painful ordeal I never wavered from my conviction that Dad's death was a random act of violence,\" Jordan said in a statement issued through his lawyer in Washington. \"Thus I was deeply disturbed by the early reports speculating that there was a sinister connection to Dad's death.

Mr. Hayes had a confident and accurate tenor, wooden at times but thoroughly idiomatic. His acting was hardly less impressive; alongside his three Heidelberg buddies (of whom Gordon Gietz's Detlef deserves to be singled out), he artfully conveyed the obnoxious collegiate drunkenness crucial to Act II.

The show, the first organized by Sheryl Conkelton, the museum's new associate curator of photography, includes work by Jan Groover, Andy Warhol, Robert Cumming, Richard Avedon and many other artists. Judging from the works on view, perhaps the most frequent use photographers have made of multiple images has been to create what are in effect mini-movies, sequences of images that describe an event not in a single glimpse but as a series of moments.

The name, meaning relaxation in French, has a sturdy Minimalist lineage: Erik Satie took it as the title for his 1924 ballet project with Francis Picabia. \"Relache\" is also an appropriate term for late-August music making, since French stage bills have long used it to indicate \"no performances, on vacation.\"   The first work on the program was the strongest: Robert Ashley's \"Outcome Inevitable,\" written especially for this group and exploiting its distinctive array of instruments (flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, viola, double bass, percussion and keyboards).
