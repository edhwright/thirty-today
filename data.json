The move temporarily solved New York's roster problem, but it failed to end the speculation regarding Rivers, a 33-year-old point guard who is trying to come back from reconstructive left knee surgery. It's unlikely that the Knicks will keep four point guards all season. They may still make a deal involving Rivers or another guard, or Rivers might be waived if his knee doesn't hold up. But being activated today was a pleasant surprise for Rivers, who wants to resume his career -- no matter where it leads him.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"High Court Backs Cities' Zoning of Sex Shops","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/opinion/l-high-court-backs-cities-zoning-of-sex-shops-972487.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, states confidently that Mayor Rudolph W.

His voice is a deep baritone, full of portentous Jim Morrison mannerisms, and his songs take up Satanism, death, sadomasochism and nearly everything else he could glean from old Black Sabbath records. \"I am a walking screaming hell/A thing of torture to behold\" he vowed as his band, Danzig, started its set on Monday night at a sold-out Roseland. Actually, he was a stocky, long-haired 35-year-old man with Elvis Presley sideburns, black jeans, cowboy boots and a rubber top that might have come from a wet suit, doing his best to glower as seriously as his songs required.   Mr. Danzig first made his reputation in the 1970's leading the Misfits, a punk band with a horror-movie fixation. Danzig is actually more old-fashioned; it draws on the blues-rock and heavy metal that punk-rock wanted to shake up. The four-man band -- with John Christ on guitar, Eerie Von on bass and Joey Castillo on drums -- is breathtakingly predictable. Every riff pounds its appointed number of times, every guitar solo delivers the appropriate squiggles.

The Serbs' war on Bosnia has exposed deep divisions among the Western powers over NATO's role and the question of European security. Some U.S. policy makers believe that the way to revive NATO is to enlarge it by offering membership and the military guarantees that membership confers to a few countries in Eastern Europe. Their rallying cry is \"Expand or die.\"   That is a questionable idea. If Washington continues to move in this direction, it is sure to generate more trans-Atlantic divisiveness. It will burden NATO's existing members with risky new obligations. Moreover, inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join will affront those who are likely to be left out, like Ukraine and the Baltic republics. Worse yet, expansion could strengthen Russian nationalists opposed to Boris Yeltsin and his Western-oriented reformers. The net result is that a larger NATO could diminish rather than strengthen European security.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/nyregion/news-summary-965383.html","abstract":"  International A3-16  U.N.

When he and his family arrived here the other day, fleeing the civil war against Kurdish guerrillas in the southeast, they became part of a wave of migration to the cities that has shifted the nation's center of gravity from village to metropolis. And, propelled from Anatolia's far reaches by poverty and war, needs and dreams, this great column has come to represent another phenomenon, far more troubling to Turkey's authorities and their Western allies -- the grist of an Islamic movement that would challenge the secular core and Western leanings of the 71-year-old republic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"The Met Tries To Reinvent An Opera Classic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/arts/the-met-tries-to-reinvent-an-opera-classic.html","abstract":"  It was, nearly, one of the most touching scenes in one of the most blindly passionate of operas.

But Jellybean Benitez, best known for his production work with Madonna, Sting, Whitney Houston and such Latin artists as Ruben Blades and Marc Anthony, decided to take his new Latin music record label elsewhere. He went to Wall Street, and after some 18 months of negotiating and planning, he has found a backer: Wasserstein Perella, a leading international investment bank. In addition to forming an independent record label that will release pop music by bilingual Latin artists, Mr. Benitez and Wasserstein Perella have formed JB Music Publishing to acquire the rights to music by new and old artists in all genres.   Besides the fact that few record labels have ever found a sponsor on Wall Street, this deal, which industry sources say is in the $15 million range, is unusual for another reason. It shows just how much faith big business has in the exploding Latin music market. Sales of Latin music have nearly doubled since 1990. The pop audience for Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada continues to grow, and the new album by the Mexican singer Luis Miguel entered the pop album charts at No. 29 in August, the best debut ever for a Spanish-language album. And there's still room for sales to grow. Though 10 percent of this country's population is Hispanic, Latin music makes up only 2 percent of domestic record sales.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941201","headline":"It's the End of the Riff for Wynton Marsalis's Septet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/01/arts/it-s-the-end-of-the-riff-for-wynton-marsalis-s-septet.html","abstract":"  Wynton Marsalis made news in his first set on Tuesday night at the Village Vanguard.

Alone and with his three-person backing band, Mr. Jackson played Chopin esque piano nocturnes and two-chord guitar rock, Afro-Caribbean grooves and Celtic-flavored folk.

This is perhaps emblematic of the path Mr. Jackson's career has followed. On his first album, \"Look Sharp!\" (1979), Mr. Jackson came on like a disaffected post-punk wiseacre with smarts to match his attitude. On follow-up albums, he soon proved that \"Look Sharp!\" was just a phase, and since then his entire output has been one of phases, moving from the rhythm-and-blues nostalgia of the album \"Jumpin' Jive\" to the updated salsa of \"Night and Day\" to the jazz and cabaret of \"Body and Soul\" to the mock-classical compositions of \"Will Power.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941201","headline":"CHRONICLE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/01/style/chronicle-980200.html","abstract":"  LANI GUINIER, whose nomination for the position of Assistant Attorney General for civil rights was withdrawn by President Clinton a year and a half ago because of opposition provoked by her scholarly writings, announced a new undertaking on Tuesday.

But the police said today he did it without a degree or license to practice dentistry.   \"He provided a full range of dental services, everything from new bridges and crowns to root canal,\" said Detective Lieut. Gerard Pelkofsky of the Suffolk County police.   Mr. Cordova's illegal practice is an example of an underground network that serves Suffolk's growing population of Central and South American immigrants. It is a network that provides services with no language barriers and no questions about alien status, the police and advocates for Latino immigrants said.   \"Dental and medical care is a big problem for them,\" said Patrick Young, program director for the Central American Refugee Center, an advocacy and service organization in Hempstead. \"They have no idea how things work in this country so they go where their friends go and where people speak their language.\"   Mr. Cordova's illegal practice came to light a week ago when a patient who had had root canal work developed an infection and had to have several teeth extracted by a licensed dentist, the police said.   The patient, a native of El Salvador, complained to the police, who found that Mr. Cordova had attended dental school in El Salvador but had never earned a degree in dentistry and was never granted a license to practice dentistry.   Lieutenant Pelkofsky said detectives raided Mr. Cordova's split-level brick and aluminum-sided home here at 81 Adams Street at 8:50 P.M. on Wednesday and found a complete dental office on the lower floor.   Mr. Cordova, 47, and his wife, Rosa, 42, who worked as his receptionist and dental assistant, were charged with the unlawful practice of dentistry. Both were given desk appearance summonses and are to appear in First District Court in Central Islip on Jan. 17.   Lieutenant Pelkofsky said the Cordovas faced other possible charges, including the violation of environmental laws in disposing of X-ray film and other items, and failure to use procedures necessary to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus.   The police said that Mr. Cordova's father and brothers were all practicing dentists in El Salvador and that his son was a student at the New York University School of Dentistry.   At one time in Central America, it was not uncommon for some dentists to work without formal degrees. Typically, they learned their trade as apprentices to other dentists.   Mr. Cordova had worked as a technician at a dental laboratory on Long Island until two years ago, when he quit to work full time at his growing dental practice, the police said.   The shades were drawn at the Cordova home this afternoon and telephone calls went answered. The mailman made a delivery shortly after noon as two young men, one of whom was described by a neighbor as Mr. Cordova's son, entered the house. Both declined to comment.    Maria Hernandez, who lives around the corner on Jackson Avenue with her sister and brother-in-law -- all Salvadoran immigrants -- said her sister had been a patient of Mr. Cordova's.   \"I can't believe he is not a real dentist,\" Ms. Hernandez said. \"My sister had no problems with him. He and his wife were always very nice to us.\"   Mr. Young of the Central American Refugee Center said that an estimated 85,000 Salvadoran immigrants live on Long Island, of which 35,000 live in Suffolk. The largest concentration, or about 5,000, live in modest single-family homes and apartments in Brentwood, he said.   Most Salvadoran men are legal aliens, he said, while many of the women and children tended to be illegal aliens.   \"Finding good professional health care and legal advice is a difficult problem for Latino immigrants,\" he said. \"There have been many cases involving people who have taken advantage of Salvadorans and their problems with immigration. This case with a dentist points out the need for better educating the Salvadorans about medical services available to them.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"Guilty Verdict For Gunman In Van Attack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/nyregion/guilty-verdict-for-gunman-in-van-attack.html","abstract":"  A Manhattan jury yesterday found a 28-year-old immigrant from Lebanon guilty of murder and attempted murder for firing shot after shot into a vanload of Hasidic students crossing the Brooklyn Bridge last March 1, killing one and injuring three others.

Modern psychiatry might just call it magical thinking: a vision of what the world could be, should be, would be, rather than what it is. Yet an artist like Ferdinand Hodler (1853-1918) had good reason to want the world changed. He was born into poverty, and by the time he was 12, both parents were dead of tuberculosis, a disease that would later kill his brothers and sisters, two of his mistresses and his son.   In one way or another, this traumatic, hammering experience of loss pervades almost every aspect of \"Ferdinand Hodler: Views and Visions\" at the National Academy of Design. The exhibition is the first American overview of this Swiss artist's career in more than 20 years, and even though the large-scale works that made his name are not included, it captures the blend of passion and reserve that defines his work.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"Double Lockout: Minors Bolt Door","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/sports/hockey-double-lockout-minors-bolt-door.html","abstract":"  National Hockey League players, locked out for more than two months, have found another door shut.

The festivities got under way on Wednesday night when the company gave this season's first performance of George Balanchine's version of the holiday classic. The \"Nutcracker\" revelry continues through Dec. 31 and should delight everyone but Scrooge.   Fortunately, in the world of \"The Nutcracker\" there are no Scrooges. The work's eccentric characters are benign. Mischievous children never mature into delinquents. Adults are warmhearted. And although there are wicked mice, those marauding rodents are soon defeated. Almost everything else in the ballet involves merrymaking. There's a wonderful family gathering in the first act.  Snowflake fairies frisk convivially through that act's finale. The second act is another party, this time in an enchanted realm where sweets mingle and give no one indigestion. And the candies' ruler, the Sugarplum Fairy, is not so much an imperious queen as a gracious hostess.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"Inside Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/arts/inside-art.html","abstract":"  The London Auctions    While the pickings were the weakest in memory, the responses at the sales of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture in London this week were not.

This beautiful exhibition, as seductive as it is esoteric, adds a substantial chapter to the general understanding of one of civilization's most widely revered periods.   Not that the word \"chapter\" really describes \"Greek Gold.\" The exhibition is more like a thorough outline, an unusually rich and delightful form of Monarch Notes: one strength is the remarkable degree to which it functions as a microcosm. Its usually tiny works of wearable ancient art echo in miniature many of the themes, motifs and concerns at the heart of classical Greece, including its preoccupation with the human body, its devotion to its all-too-human gods and the perfect pitch with which it distilled its forms and proportions from nature.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/nyregion/news-summary-983799.html","abstract":"  International A3-17  ECONOMIST TAKES OVER IN MEXICO  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon took office as President in Mexico, promising a new fight against poverty and sweeping changes in the corrupt justice system.

The seven-hour play is a landmark of pre-third-millennium theater; it won a 1993 Pulitzer and Tony for best play; it made or hugely enhanced the reputations of actors like Stephen Spinella, Ron Leibman, Joe Mantello, Kathleen Chalfant and Marcia Gay Harden and established Mr. Kushner as a leading American playwright.   \"Angels\" also defeated the inherent dilemma in an important new subgenre, the AIDS play. Plays about an inevitably fatal disease risked having the dramatic tension pricked out of them in midplot by a simple blood test: the audience would know an H.I.V.-positive hero was doomed; an uninfected one had a happy ending in sight, no matter how serious the tone. Mr. Kushner transcended that by introducing angels and lobbying trips to heaven. A switch to science-fiction can make an audience throw up its hands, but he neither yanked a plot-fixing deity out of the heavenly machinery nor confected an ending more apocalyptic than a plea for more time.

After a decade of trap blocks, aches and pains, contract squabbles, two Super Bowl rings, losing seasons and Ray Handley, it's easy to understand why Roberts speaks calmly about his past and future with the Giants.   While Roberts, who has one year left on a two-year deal, says he expects to be back in 1995, he leaves open the possibility that the Giants may decide to go with the younger players next season. He feels that way because when the Giants signed him to a new deal, they didn't give him guaranteed money up front. If they did, it would be harder for them to let him go next season.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19941202","headline":"Article 988219 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/02/arts/article-988219-no-title.html","abstract":"  For 11 years, Paola's has been the kind of charming neighborhood Italian hole in the wall that Upper East Siders have retreated to when the onslaught of the new and the loud became too much.
