Mr. Dendy manages to make something fresh and rich out of all the stereotypes in a performance that is eerily close to the language and rhythms of New York's streets.

After a 1-15 record in the first season, critics had a hearty laugh. And the ridicule continued as the Cowboys wheeled and dealed in trades for draft picks and built a smaller, quicker team than the big, bruising types that inhabited the National Football Conference East.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930906","headline":"Essay; Forward Together, Again","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/06/opinion/essay-forward-together-again.html","abstract":"  In his story of \"The Purloined Letter,\" Edgar Allan Poe showed that the best place to hide anything from avid searchers is to leave it in plain view.

People took to the streets of Bogota and other cities, dancing, honking car horns and waving flags. Besides the host, the United States, and defending champion Germany, Colombia joined Mexico, Russia and Greece for next summer's championship.

The plural \"bravi\" was a tribute to the orchestra, La Scala Philharmonic, or, as Mr. Muti insists on calling it, even on his internationally released records, L'Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala.   This was, in truth, a good concert, part of a short tour of Spain and Italy that the orchestra has undertaken before it buckles down to rehearse its fall symphonic season in Milan. With Brahms's Serenade No. 1, excerpts from Busoni's \"Turandot\" and Ravel's \"Bolero\" and an encore of Verdi's \"Vespri Siciliani\" Overture, the program avoided heavyweight German scores but otherwise revealed an ensemble of skill and style.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930908","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/08/sports/results-plus-985793.html","abstract":"  SOCCER  For England's Manager, It's Win or Else  Graham Taylor will face the most crucial game of his three-year reign as England's soccer manager today when his team plays host to Poland in a World Cup qualifying match it cannot afford to lose.

Several communities are trying innovative styles of government to bridge the economic gap between cities and suburbs and address their shared problems. These efforts are long overdue.    For example, last November in Oregon, Portland-area voters approved a home-rule charter to give new powers to the region's \"metro\" government, a sort of umbrella governing body. The metro government's priority, the new charter states, will be less to provide regional services than to manage the region's growth, which has been exploding. Goals include an affordable housing plan, in which each of the 24 cities and towns in the three-county jurisdiction must accept a proportionate share of low- and moderate-income housing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930908","headline":"NEW NAME EMERGES FOR RIGHTS OFFICE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/08/us/new-name-emerges-for-rights-office.html","abstract":"  John Payton, a lawyer who argued one of the most significant civil rights cases of the last decade before the Supreme Court, has emerged as a leading candidate to head the civil rights division in the Justice Department, Clinton Administration officials said today.

I hadn't looked at that picture, or any of those I took during a journey to Yugoslavia, for a long time. Then recently I saw a very different photograph in The Washington Post. A man carrying buckets of water was crossing a curious structure swathed in scaffolding, tires, planks and blankets to protect it from shell blasts and sniper fire. Were it not for the caption, I would never have guessed it was my bridge -- my bridge because love confers possession, if only in the mind.

Mr. Gabriel headlined a nine-hour marathon with musicians from every continent but South America and Antarctica. Yet the exotic culture explored in greatest depth came from some modest Atlantic islands: Britain.   Although Womad goes back more than a decade, the United States tour is modeled on the Lollapalooza Festival. There are two stages, a large one (with seating) for mainstream rock and a secondary one, in an open field, for lesser-known performers.
