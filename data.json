The London woman, who has not been identified but is described as wealthy, gave birth after eggs donated by a younger woman and fertilized by the older woman's husband were implanted in her at a private fertility clinic in Rome.

The key to the economic plight of these nations is all too easy to overlook: the terrible instability of their currencies and the great difficulty of converting them to other currencies. Yet if the U.S. and the rest of world ignore the currency problems of the old Soviet bloc, we will be repeating the very mistakes that led to World War II -- and forgetting the lessons of the 1940's, which not only corrected these mistakes but also laid the basis for a world trading system and for the collapse of the Soviet empire.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931229","headline":"Books of The Times; A Member of the Band Recalls Its Glory Days","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/books/books-of-the-times-a-member-of-the-band-recalls-its-glory-days.html","abstract":"  This Wheel's on Fire Levon Helm and the Story of the Band  By Levon Helm with Stephen Davis  Illustrated. 320 pages.

The hourlong program itself is divided between Palestinian and Israeli, with the first half given to the enduring leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who seems almost to have shaved for the occasion. Despite a little talk-show vaporing (\"But that's the dream that's never left you,\" Mr. Frost prompts Mr. Arafat about Palestinian claims to Jerusalem), the program does get into several prickly subjects.   On Jerusalem, Mr. Arafat, whose spotty English requires Mr. Frost to repeat some answers, proposes making the contested city the joint capital of Israel and a Palestinian state. For some reason, Mr. Frost does not elicit the Israeli Prime Minister's opinion of any such innovation. Nor does he ask Mr. Arafat about his intentions toward the Jewish settlements in Gaza, which Mr. Rabin maintains \"are going to stay; they are not going to be uprooted.\"   Although Mr. Rabin avows his commitment to successful negotiations, he does not exude as much confidence as his new television partner, who announces more than once, \"Where there's a will, there's a way.\" To one interesting question -- what would the newly organized Palestinian police force do if a Palestinian should shoot an Israeli -- Mr. Arafat replies, \"Sorry, we are not speaking about small issues.\"   Among the issues that Mr. Rabin does not consider small is whether, as Mr. Arafat holds, an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho represents the beginning of a Palestinian state or whether, as Mr. Rabin views it, the withdrawal is only \"an interim agreement that leaves the future open.\" They also disagree on which side will control the borders of the territories in question.   Both men assure Mr. Frost that they can manage the opponents among their own people to any agreement, but Mr. Rabin expresses skepticism about Mr. Arafat's ability to bring into line groups like Hamas, which are continuing to attack Israelis. The Prime Minister observes in his flat bass: \"They deny the right of Israel to exist. They opposed the very peace negotiations. They are against the agreement.\"   The two leaders display different styles. Mr. Arafat is more the showman; he speaks of himself as a martyr. Mr. Rabin is the Jewish Al Gore. But in their different ways, both leaven hope with wariness as they edge toward what Mr. Rabin calls \"calculated risks for peace.\"   Their appearance tonight makes plain, in case there was any doubt, that despite Mr. Arafat's waving away of what he calls \"small issues,\" the road to peace in the Middle East is still a minefield of details as well as principles.

It happened again tonight. After playing an inspired three quarters against the three-time defending champion Bulls and continuing their strong revival with a one-point lead, the Nets wilted during the final period when Chicago stopped toying with them, employed its powerful arsenal of Scottie Pippen and Toni Kukoc and burst to a 94-86 victory.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931230","headline":"2 Quarterbacks, Many Questions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/sports/football-2-quarterbacks-many-questions.html","abstract":"  For two different reasons, the Oilers and the Jets were today pondering the decorum of playing or not playing their starting quarterbacks in Sunday's regular-season finale for both teams at the Astrodome.   The issue arose for the Oilers when Warren Moon cracked his ribs against the 49ers last Saturday. The Oilers have a playoff spot wrapped up, and if Buffalo loses to Indianapolis on Sunday Houston will have a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. If that happens and Moon doesn't play against the Jets, he could rest for three weeks and give his ribs time to heal. Oilers Coach Jack Pardee said today that Moon probably won't practice this week and that he will make a game-time decision on whether Moon will start. The Jets and Oilers will know if the game matters before the opening kickoff. Different Problem for Jets    Jets Coach Bruce Coslet reacted sharply when an article Tuesday in Newsday suggested that the team might decide to bench Esiason if the Jets are eliminated from the playoffs before Sunday's game. The reason: If Esiason increases his quarterback rating to 89 (it is now 87.1), the Jets will owe Cincinnati a second-round pick from the 1994 draft. That was one of the provisions of the trade that brought Esiason to the Jets from the Bengals in the off season. Coslet said Esiason will play \"every snap\" of the game, barring injury.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931230","headline":"Broken Homes, Mended Lives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/opinion/broken-homes-mended-lives.html","abstract":"Does it make sense to spend money to keep troubled families together?

The court was dealing with the old Defense Department ban on homosexuals, but its decision cast doubt on the Administration's slightly more liberal policy, which permits homosexuals to serve in the armed forces but only if they keep their sexual orientation a secret.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19931230","headline":"U.S. Jews Don't Clamor for Spy's Release","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/opinion/l-us-jews-don-t-clamor-for-spy-s-release-237593.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   American Jewish organizations, including rabbinical groups, have been urging President Clinton to shorten the sentence of Jonathan J.

De La Soul has been notorious for years for their tedious live shows but the group has been steadily improving. They used to just stand there.

With such scholarly shows as \"Corot to Monet: The Rise of Landscape Painting in France,\" the splendid Tibetan showcase \"Wisdom and Compassion\" and highlights from several of America's treasurable smaller museums to its credit, the gallery's track record has been honorable, and sometimes a good deal more than that.

No doubt the light, reflective gold paint that covers these objects lends them a mysterious, numinous glow in dark churches and monastic interiors.

Another altar, related to AIDS and put together by a Brazilian priest, Pai Balbino de Paula, presents rows of clay pots adorned with metalwork and sprinkled with popcorn, one of the foods sacred to the Brazilian Yoruba deity Omo-Olu.

It will be hard to find a better party anywhere. The band, whether it's New Year's Eve or not, take the idea of carnival, of excess and celebration, to the limit. They'll play a weird hybrid of country, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll, with the Beach Boys and Sun Ra thrown in for some surrealism. They'll be joined by Terrance Simien and his Mallet Playboys, a rocking Louisiana zydeco band. There are two shows: the first, at 7 P.M., costs $20; the second, at 11 P.M., costs $40 and includes a Champagne toast at midnight. Both shows have a two-drink minimum. PETER WATROUS Classic Blues    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7902. One of the last of the great blues shouters will treat an audience to the classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which will come with a blues nastiness to them. Tickets are available for the 8:30 and 1 A.M. shows. There is a $25 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Zanzibar Guitar    Matt (Guitar) Murphy, Zanzibar, 73 Eighth Avenue, near 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Before this guitarist was saddled with leading the Blues Brothers Band, from the movie of the same name, he was an exceptional blues guitarist who made James Cotton's mid-1970's band rock. He's all speed and texture, and he uses whirling lines that can cause a commotion. There are two sets, at 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. , and $75 gets you a four-course meal and Champagne, while $35 lets you stand at the bar. P. W. Time-Warped Tunes    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. White, a clarinetist, leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's polyphonic, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the raucous group improvisations that bray and holler. He has become a New Year's tradition at the Vanguard, and hearing his band invites audiences into a time warp; it makes a listener understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. There is also a 1 A.M. show with a $20 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Piano Man    John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. He's a florid pianist who always plays like he's never going to play again, and wants to get everything he knows in by the last chorus. He'll be backed by the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Victor Lewis, who is one of jazz's greatest living drummers. It will be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show starts at 9, and for $120 there is a five-course dinner and Champagne. Before 1 A.M. there is a $25 cover and $20 minimum for the bar. From 1 to 4 A.M., the cover is $20 and there is a $15 minimum. P. W. Two Wily Veterans    Nancy Wilson and Gato Barbieri, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. Ms. Wilson can be a viscerally moving performer, one of the best singers to graduate from Dinah Washington's vocal finishing school. She can be smooth or rough and nasal, and both stances imply emotion. Mr. Barbieri is a showman whose best recordings, made in the 1960's, have a hard power. Tickets are available for the 7 P.M. show in the bar for $90. At 1 A.M., the $120 tickets include breakfast and Champagne. P. W. Ulmer Power    James Blood Ulmer, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. This year is Mr. Ulmer's fifth New Year's Eve at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes use of drones and odd tunings, is as distinct as anything that walks the planet. It's hard-rocking, slippery music, charged with power. Sets are at 9 and midnight, and the $20 cover buys a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. Dark Side Sounds    Stephen Scott, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, off Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. Mr. Scott is the most austere pianist of his generation, somebody who plays the dark side of every tune. The music comes out moody and emotional. He's anything but glib, and his sense of space is wonderfully Monkish, elegant and relaxed, yet taut. He's a young master. There are three sets, at 9 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. The $35 cover includes two drinks plus Champagne and party favors. P. W. Adderley's Band    Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best working bands in jazz features Mr. Adderley's cool sound on horn, and Vincent Herring's explosive soloing on alto and soprano saxophones. The rhythm section includes Rob Bargan on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums and it swings with authority. It's mainstream jazz at its most exciting. The show starts at 9 P.M. and $99 includes dinner, Champagne and party favors. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $25 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Visiones, in the Village    Cecil Brooks 3d, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-5576. Mr. Brooks, a good young drummer, always leads swinging bands, and this one includes the trumpeter Jack Walrath and the pianist James Weidman. Jeanie Bryson, a singer, will be on hand as well. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1:30 A.M. The first set has a $12 cover and a $10 minimum; the second, a $25 cover and a $10 minimum, and the 1:30 set has a $10 cover and $10 minimum. For $100, stay for three sets and have a full dinner and Champagne; $65 buys three sets, three drinks and a Champagne toast. P. W. Sharp in SoHo    Elliott Sharp, Nick and Eddie, 203 Spring Street, at Sullivan Street, SoHo, (212) 219-9090. Mr. Sharp, a guitarist and fixture of the downtown experimental scene, will be leading a trio that shows his roots. From 9:30 to midnight, he'll be playing jazz standards. At midnight he'll start playing blues. The $75 ticket includes a four-course dinner and a Champagne toast. P.

The 1948 extravaganza about a ballerina doomed to choose between love and her career is a holiday sugarplum of a movie. It has returned to Film Forum in the South Village, where it will play through Jan. 13.   The film has the same overripe appeal of many smaller 1940's movies in which a tragic love affair sends some woman flying in front of a train or dropping on the pavement (the \"Waterloo Bridge\" genre). Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) is torn mercilessly between two men: the heartless impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), who only wants her to dance, and the young conductor Julian Craster (Marius Goring), who wants her to give up her art for love of him. The acting is florid, but the melodrama and snippets of ballet are as alluring as ever.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"Diner's Journal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/arts/diner-s-journal.html","abstract":"  Going Home, as the Chef    Rick Laakkonen is going back across the East River to the River Cafe in Brooklyn.

But an outcry from political, civic and religious leaders persuaded officials at the Justice Department in Washington to investigate whether the laws could be applied to Mr. Nelson, who was a 16-year-old high school student when the killing occurred in 1991, or anyone else who might be implicated in the case.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"Hornets End Bulls' Streak At 10 Games","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/sports/pro-basketball-hornets-end-bulls-streak-at-10-games.html","abstract":"  Hornets 115, Bulls 95   Dell Curry scored 28 points and was 5 for 7 on 3-pointers as the Hornets, without Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson, snapped the Chicago Bulls' 10-game winning streak, 115-95, last night in Charlotte, N.C.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"Critics' Choices; Artistic Ideas for Starting the New Year Right","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/arts/critics-choices-artistic-ideas-for-starting-the-new-year-right-286993.html","abstract":"  Classical Music   It is not every day one gets to hear Victor Borge clowning around with Robert Merrill, or Robert Sherman delivering the narration to \"Ferdinand the Bull,\" or Giora Feidman coaxing a small concert hall full of hard-nosed music professionals to sing along with a klezmer melody.

Add the fact that the run of \"Singular Dimensions in Painting,\" a selection of Minimalist works in the second-floor galleries, has stretched to six months (it is now to close on Sunday), and one can easily conclude that the Guggenheim SoHo is in something of a holding pattern. The branch has played host to some impressive traveling shows, but otherwise it has seemed underused, as if the museum has bitten off more space than it can handle, whether for curatorial or financial reasons.   Nonetheless, while undeniably familiar around the edges (and scheduled for its own six-month run), this new exhibition does present the early modern master most thoroughly associated with the museum in a refreshing light, one that is intimate and process-oriented and therefore especially well suited to a part of town full of working artists.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931231","headline":"U.S. Recasts Demjanjuk As It Seeks to Oust Him","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/31/us/us-recasts-demjanjuk-as-it-seeks-to-oust-him.html","abstract":"  In a significant shift in its legal strategy, the Justice Department today abandoned its long-held contention that John Demjanjuk was one of the most barbaric Nazi figures of the Holocaust.
