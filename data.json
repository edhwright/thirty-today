The interface between the hard, cold, logical world of physics and the fuzzy, unpredictable realm of human emotions is also the subject of Mr. Lightman's latest novel, \"Good Benito.\" This time, however, he has chosen to focus not on the philosophical implications of physics but on the soul of an individual physicist.

But tranquilizing rhetoric cannot mask the program's potential harm for a city that already exports more Federal tax dollars than it gets back. That powerful message emerges from a report, issued by Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, that provides rough estimates of the impact of G.O.P. spending cuts on the residents of New York City. The chilling numbers document an obligation to protect their constituents that now falls on members of the city's Congressional delegation, especially Alfonse D'Amato, New York's influential Republican Senator.   Mr. Schumer makes a straightforward calculation. To fulfill the contract's pledge to balance the Federal budget and cut taxes, Congress would have to cut about $350 billion out of the budget in the year 2002. But the contract would exempt Social Security, defense and interest on the national debt, thus drastically narrowing the places to find the money. It means Congress would have to chop 30 percent out of all the non-exempt programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950106","headline":"European Lifestyles in the Skies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/style/IHT-european-lifestyles-in-the-skies.html","abstract":"CONSUMER research has many functions, such as finding the need for more research, to prove pretty well anything you want, or simply to rediscover the obvious.

Manila was the first chartered city in the country, designated by Philippine Commission Act No. 183 on July 31, 1901. It became autonomous with the passage of Republic Act No. 409, \"The Revised Charter of the City of Manila\", on June 18, 1949.

She does not earn a salary, and at 68, she is entitled to a less frenetic schedule. But with each passing year, her sense of obligation toward the city she calls home has grown.    Mrs. Karp belongs to a volunteer program run by the Community Service Society of New York, a charity supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Since 1971, the society's Retired Senior Volunteer Program has supplied hundreds of public and private agencies with trained volunteers to do jobs as various as delivering food to the homeless and doing research at universities.    At a time when the city government is eliminating positions and programs at social-service agencies, Mrs. Karp's work is invaluable. She is a court-appointed advocate for children in the city's vast foster care system. Above all, she tries to insure that foster children are happy and secure.    \"Trying to make the system function well can be maddening,\" said Mrs. Karp, a former freelance journalist. \"But I'm a good nagger, so occasionally I succeed.\"    Mrs. Karp's organization, Court Appointed Special Advocates, depends largely on its 94 volunteers to monitor about 750 cases involving 1,200 children. Since Mrs. Karp started volunteering in 1988, the number of children in the city's foster care system has grown to 45,000, and the need for supervision is greater than ever. Often, Mrs. Karp and her colleagues find children who are neglected by a system that is supposed to protect them, usually because caseworkers are overworked and undertrained.    Mrs. Karp works with children whose parents placed them in foster care voluntarily. Often, the parents did so because they were homeless, drug addicted or incarcerated. Most of the children eventually return to their parents, but in a few cases, Mrs. Karp's efforts have led to foster families adopting children. Her most recent victory involved a troubled teen-aged girl who had been abandoned on the street as an infant. Her foster mother could not care for her any longer, so Mrs. Karp did some research and found the girl's baby sister, who was in another foster home.    The girl now lives with her sister, and their foster family is considering adopting them.    \"She was so taken with the idea of being a good role model for the baby that she got serious about her life,\" Mrs. Karp said. \"It's rare to see a situation turn out so well, so I felt especially good about it.\"    But the most common feeling is frustration. She goes to Family Court several times a month, and she often spends hours waiting for her case to be called. Letters to parents detailing their options frequently go unanswered. The most maddening aspect of the job, she said, is dealing with the city bureaucracy.    \"They don't always return my calls, and sometimes they don't even answer their phones,\" she said. \"They do things by rote, and it's very hard to push them in a new direction.\"    But Lee Pardee, the case and research coordinator for the advocate program, said volunteers are more likely than anyone to succeed in changing the system.    \"People like Naomi come in with fresh ideas and a can-do attitude that is crucial for this kind of work,\" Ms. Pardee said. \"They are here because they want to be, and they are more committed than anyone to helping these kids.\"    The experience has also helped Mrs. Karp cultivate self-confidence. She is finishing a novel about the foster-care system, based on her own experiences. And she plans to continue volunteering for as long as she is able.    \"I feel I have to use my time productively,\" she said. \"I have loved living in this city, and this is an excellent way to give something back.\"  Previously Recorded $2,963,874.95 Recorded Yesterday 103,132.20 Total$3,067,007.15","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950107","headline":"Intimacy Turns Out To Be Very Hard Work","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/07/arts/dance-review-intimacy-turns-out-to-be-very-hard-work.html","abstract":"  Whereas it's easy, and sometimes fun, to be nasty, showing affection can be difficult.

Though the performer has already been made up into an uncanny facsimile of images of the painter, it is this singular anatomy lesson that brings Schiele to full life, as the artist seems to sculpture himself into being.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950107","headline":"French Talk to Iraqis, Angering Allies","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/07/world/french-talk-to-iraqis-angering-allies.html","abstract":"  Drawing sharp criticism from the United States and Britain, France received a senior Iraqi official today for the first time since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and agreed to open a diplomatic office in Baghdad soon.

The competition here this week at the 15th World Universities Debating Championship at Princeton University featuring the best student speakers from 27 nations has them all a little nervous.    \"In Canada, we get a lot of respect,\" said Paul Ciufo, 24, a creative writing student at York University in Canada. \"But it's hard to compete with teams like Oxford who have reputations on the international circuit.\" He complained that the judges were too quick to be impressed with any idea delivered with a British accent.    \"The Irish go more for style than facts,\" said Dermot Conway, a member of the University of Cork team, which will be the host of the 1996 championship. \"It's like sitting down and having a good argument with a friend.\"    Nick McGrath, a kilted debater from the University of Glasgow, fretted that Americans who judge the debates were having difficulty understanding his accent and his humor.    Enthusiasm ran high all week as 244 two-member teams from more than 100 schools paired off in a series of preliminary rounds to decide the 32 top teams that will square off this weekend to battle for the world championship. There will have been up to 1,130 separate debates by Sunday's championship finals.    In an age when television and other electronic devices have elevated sound and diminished conversation, it is consoling to some to know that a premium on the art of persuasion and logical discourse is still embraced by young people who can go for the jugular one moment and then go out for a drink together.    \"The quality of political speeches is so poor in the United States today that it is marvelous to see students who may eventually enter public service get up on their feet and construct complete sentences and sometimes do it with a degree of spontaneous wit,\" said Dr. John Fleming, a Princeton professor of English and comparative literature who is master of Wilson College on campus.    Ross Harper, 21, from the University of Glasgow, said, \"I think it's a safe bet to say that many of the debaters here are going to be in the top levels of power in their countries in 10 or 20 years.\"     Most of the 488 debaters will go on to careers in law and politics, said Chris Paolella, a Princeton junior who is serving as tournament director.    It was the fate of Mr. Ciufo and his partner, Lawrence Rabie, to meet the Oxford team in the one \"humorous\" debate of the tournament assigned to all of the 244 teams.    Representing Oxford was the star-quality team of Rufus Black, an Australian, and Rod Clayton. It was their duty, one they took up with alacrity, to defend the proposition \"American Culture Is an Oxymoron.\" The Canadians, by the draw announced only 20 minutes before the start, were on the attack.    Mr. Clayton ripped into American culture, tossing off several lines of verse in Latin in an exhibition of what he championed as real culture as compared to the \"low culture\" exported by Americans.    In rebuttal, Mr. Rabie spun out a bit of verse himself.    \"Bye, bye Miss American Pie.    \"Took my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry.\"    Not to be outdone, Mr. Black, a finalist in last year's championship, relied on an old four-letter Anglo-Saxon word to characterize his sentiments about the quality of American culture, an angle of attack that likely cost him points with the judge, Steven Johnson, 26, a lecturer in rhetoric from Creighton College in Kansas.    \"Rufus is one of the best debaters in the world on a serious subject but to see him dancing around the room speaking profanities goes beyond the substance of argumentation,\" Mr. Johnson said.    Oxford was awarded the match but both teams, by the end of the preliminary rounds, were among the 32 teams chosen for the semifinals, as was the Glasgow team of Mr. Harper and Mr. McGrath.    Daily results and rankings are supposed to be a closely guarded secret but team members seemed to spend most of their time between debates trying to breach the security of the tabulation committee operated by Princeton's venerable American Whig-Cliosophic Society (charter members were James Madison and Aaron Burr), which as host for the tournament did not enter its own teams in the debates.    \"I wish there was a trophy for tab room leaks,\" said Mr. Rabie, the Canadian. \"I'd walk away with it. My secret is to tell a judge who scored my debate that I heard I had won it and watch his reaction before he runs away from me.\"    During a break in the competition, an Irish student got on the public address system and listed the charms that awaited them in Cork next year. \"The judging will be appalling but the tab room will leak like a sieve,\" he said to cheers.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19950107","headline":"BRIEFCASE : Guinness Mahon Lifts Rates in Guernsey","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/07/your-money/IHT-briefcase-guinness-mahon-lifts-rates-in-guernsey.html","abstract":"Guinness Mahon Guernsey, the Channel Island banking subsidiary of the Guinness mahon group, has raised the interest rates on cash in British pounds cash held in its multicurrency Private Interest Check Account..The interest payable is now 4.5 percent f","thumbnail":null,"section":"Your Money"},{"date":"19950107","headline":"U.S. Starts the Return of Haitians From Guantanamo","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/07/world/us-starts-the-return-of-haitians-from-guantanamo.html","abstract":"  Rejecting appeals from human rights groups, the United States began the forced repatriation today of nearly 4,000 Haitian refugees who were granted \"safe haven\" last year at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.

The high-speed train from Madrid follows the palm-fringed curve of a bay where Mediterranean meets Atlantic, then plunges along sand dunes onto a spit with nothing on all sides but wind spray. The first port of call, which the Phoenicians named Gadir, is now Cadiz, the very last stop in Spain. In this ultimate outpost groping toward Africa or the high seas, Western civilization as we know it whites out, ships out, shows its frayed edges. All solid ground gives way to shaky, seasick definitions.\n\nIs this just a stray bit of Morocco studded with Baroque churches? Or could languid Cadiz with its stolid mercaderes be a second cousin of Mexico's Veracruz? Does its mix of walled colonial ramparts, jungle foliage and underemployment suggest a family resemblance to San Juan? Are these cool and cobbled shopping streets, more stately than seedy chasms of 19th-century conceit, a faint preview of urban Peru? Don't the balmy alamedas, windowed-in wooden balcon overhangs and surprisingly grandiose plazas indicate that we're two hours from Havana instead of Sevilla? The fortunes, as well as the look, of Cadiz have long been linked with Spain's New World empire. Here, Columbus outfitted the caravel Nina. His ship the Santa Maria was named after Puerto de Santa Maria, the across-the-bay beach town and Jerez sherry warehouser reached by ferry.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"Clamoring for a Little Quiet","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chelsea-west-village-clamoring-for-a-little-quiet.html","abstract":"  Screaming car alarms, honking cabbies and raucous drunks are facts of city life.

Prostitution laws do not vary across county lines, but by walking a few blocks south into the Bronx, prostitutes enter an area where the court system is so crowded that often, instead of Westchester's 45-to-90-day terms, they serve only a two-day jail stay.

Yet when Teddy Kollek was elected mayor of Jerusalem in 1965, there was scarcely a single park or playground. After the city was united in 1967, he gathered an international committee of architects, landscape architects, writers and professors to establish guidelines for development. As a result, the greening of this ancient city has also preserved its character.   An ordinance requiring that all buildings be constructed of Jerusalem limestone -- a legacy of British rule -- is responsible for the mellow pinkish cast that unifies the cityscape. Regulations limiting the height of buildings (in certain areas they can be no more than eight stories) makes it possible to see the whole city from many vantage points as it swoops up and down the hillsides. One of the first tasks was to clear away the ramshackle housing leaning against the ancient walls and create a greenbelt around the Old City that gives it today, with its more than 30 grass-covered archeological sites, the biblical appearance of a city on an open plain.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"Duke's Coach Hospitalized With Bad Back","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/sports/sports-people-college-basketball-duke-s-coach-hospitalized-with-bad-back.html","abstract":"  Duke Coach MIKE KRZYZEWSKI, hospitalized with back problems, was expected to miss last night's game between the No. 11 Blue Devils and No. 24 Georgia Tech in Atlanta.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"WESTCHESTER GUIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/westchester-guide-972995.html","abstract":"  ANOTHER 'FANTASTICKS'   In May 1960 Jerry Orbach opened in \"The Fantasticks\" in a little theater far off Broadway on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village.

Danto has called Warhol's \"fool\" persona was an intelligence uncannily attuned to the Zeitgeist. When Warhol died in 1987, his legacy included a 27-room town house filled with fine art, furnishings, objets d'art and jewelry that generated a staggering $25.3 million when auctioned in 1988 at Sotheby's -- funds that subsequently would be used to create the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and later, with additional money from the Dia Center for the Arts and the Carnegie Institute, to establish a museum in Pittsburgh devoted solely to Warhol's work. THE ANDY WARHOL MUSEUM (The Andy Warhol Museum/Distributed Art Publishers, $40) is a record of this collective endeavor, filled with photographs from the extensive Warhol archives. It offers a grab bag of readings, from Mr. Danto's provocative essay exploring the philosophical underpinnings of Warhol's art to Helen Searing's long-winded architectural treatise on industrial conversions and the making of museums. In the most personal of these pieces, Bennard B. Perlman, a college friend, writes engagingly of Warhol's childhood and student years. His recollections of Warhol as a shy, physically awkward observer contrast sharply with the irreverent, ultra-hip art star and socialite of Warhol's New York years. More titillating though less revealing is the picture-album-cum-captions chronology that follows. Here we learn everything from the year Warhol underwent cosmetic surgery on his nose to the scoop on the \"50 Most Beautiful People\" party at Warhol's infamous studio, the Factory. A compact disk of 17 brief audio recordings also comes with the book. \"Andy taped thousands of hours of conversations, meetings, parties and dinners,\" reports the narrator, John Giorno, a poet who appeared in \"Sleep,\" Warhol's first movie. Perhaps this obsession with self-documentation explains why Warhol felt he had no need for memory and could glibly announce, \"My mind is like a tape recorder with one button -- erase.\" ANDREA BARNET","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"Congressional Memo; 73 Mr. Smiths, of the G.O.P., Go to Washington","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/us/congressional-memo-73-mr-smiths-of-the-gop-go-to-washington.html","abstract":"  The seven House Republicans chosen by their party to summarize the accomplishments of the opening week of the 104th Congress for the press on Friday had a grand combined total of about 14 days in office.

For prospective home-exchangers, it's the time to read swap catalogues, with their cryptic entries, optimistically seeking a vine-covered cottage by the Avon in England to be exchanged for a split-level on Long Island.    Some searchers may hunch over the electronic fireside: A computer bulletin board for exchangers and renters, begun in November 1993, is so new it has only 200 or so listings, all but a handful in the United States. But access is free except for a toll call to Florida, which can be made at midnight, so there is little to lose. Targeting Teachers    Teacher Swap, now entering its ninth year, will publish its 1995 catalogue in March, plus two supplements after that. The proprietors, Ron and Ellie Frevola of Long Island, have a loose definition of teacher, encompassing active and retired, volunteer and paid, Sunday school and adult-education teachers. Mr. Frevola said the most important qualification is a long vacation making settling-in worthwhile, although some swappers offer long weekends.    People sending information who want the listing to appear in the directory that is distributed overseas should postmark the entry form by Jan. 20. If only a domestic exchange is sought, the deadline is Feb. 15. At the present pace of submissions, Mr. Frevola expects to have 700 listings in the year. Last year the main book had 34 pages with 538 entries: 225 from 32 states, 34 from Canada and 279 from 28 foreign countries, mostly in Europe.   The catalogue, which has telegraphic entries and no pictures, urges subscribers to try early and not give up the first year if they particularly want a house.    Mr. Frevola, asked about the possibility that people might come home to a damaged house, said that he had not heard of this from any exchangers among his 2,000 to 3,000 subscribers over eight years. A half-dozen complaints, none serious, had been received, he said.    Like the other publishers, Mr. Frevola said he got complaints about dirty dishes in the cupboard or car trunks that did not lock. The worst problem, he said, was created by three young teachers from France who loved their exchange with a Westchester teacher but left behind a $400 phone bill for calls to France. Mr. Frevola said his associate in France, Michel Barrere, called the three teachers and the bill was paid.    Typically, the Frevolas' catalogue disclaims \"all responsibility for a successful exchange of homes.\" It also says: \"All subscribers agree to indemnity and save harmless Teacher Swap Inc. of and from any and all liability for damages and injury to the person or property of another and against and from all suits and actions and all costs and damages resulting from the exchange of homes.\"   Those who want to be listed in the catalogue pay $42; those who want to browse but not be listed pay $50.    Teacher Swap, Box 454, Oakdale, L.I. 11769; (516) 244-2845. 7,000 Entries With Pictures    The Vacation Exchange Club, which began in 1960, published its 394-page January 1995 book last month. Karl Costabel, who bought the enterprise in 1991 from its founders, David and Mary Ostroff, says there are 7,000 entries, half with pictures. Two-thirds are in Europe; the rest are in North America, Mexico and Hawaii.   A listing, plus the five books for 1995, costs $65; it's $15 more to include a horizontal photo and $20 for a vertical. Listings for a second home cost $10 more. Information submitted by Jan. 14 will appear in the February book. Those subscribing now will get the January book. The catalogue pictures are not captioned, and unless one knows what sort of house to expect, it is not always clear whether the illustration goes with the entry above or below.    Paul G. Foldes, a lawyer in Arlington, Va., has subscribed since 1987. That year, Mr. Foldes said, he swapped his \"exec home minutes to DC tourist attactions by car, subway, ae, ac, apl, sa, tv, vcr, rr, bc, bi,\" meaning an auto exchange is possible and the house is air-conditioned, has all domestic appliances, sauna/Jacuzzi/hot tub, television, videocassette recorder, family room, balcony/deck/porch, and a bicycle. In return he got a house in upstate New York, which he and his companion and their children used as a base to see Niagara Falls, Toronto and other places.    The next exchange, he said, came in 1992, when he swapped for three weeks with a couple from Hawaii. He said that he was warned that Hawaii was in such demand he would not get anything for years. \"But we hit it right away,\" he said in an interview. \"A house on the beach at Waikiki.\" He is trying again, hoping for something in the San Francisco area.    Vacation Exchange Club, Box 650, Key West, Fla. 33041; (800) 638-3841. Link to 12 Groups    The Invented City, in business since 1991, publishes in March, June and November. In 1993 it linked up with 12 other exchange groups under the name International Home Exchange Association. The proprietor, Glenn London, said the active membership is 2,000, and the November supplement included 700 new listings. The deadline for getting into the March edition is Feb. 1. The fee for listing, or subscribing without listing, is $50.    This catalogue, which has no pictures, is easier to read than most: The entries are arrayed across the page instead of appearing in dense columns. The Invented City, 41 Sutter Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94104; (415) 673-0347. A Florida Sideline    The new one on the block is Home Exchange Network, a computer bulletin board service being operated as a sideline by a couple in Florida. This has been running a year. Because they do not yet have much to sell, the vendors, Daniel J. Rubin and his wife, Linda J. Allen, do not charge for membership. Any computer user with a modem can dial (407) 869-5956 and follow the instructions to sign on for a six-month free membership. The listings, one screen each, can be read immediately, and the instructions are easy, even for a bulletin board novice.    Mr. Rubin said most subscribers requested a form to list a house on the bulletin board rather than entering it directly into the computer. The entries may duplicate those in books; Mr. Foldes of Arlington has his house listed on this service, too.    Home Exchange Network, Box 951253, Longwood, Fla. 32791; (407) 862-7211.   The oldest of the groups, Intervac, was founded in 1951 and, with 9,400 subscribers worldwide, says it is the biggest. For a $65 fee, members receive three catalogues a year, published on Dec. 1, March 1 and May 1. Another catalogue is put out in June and is available for an extra $19. There is an $11 charge for including a photo of the property. Houses in 36 countries are listed, including North and Central America, western Europe, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The United States branch is run from San Francisco by Paula Jaffe and Lori Horne, who bought the business eight years ago.

The branch is expected to open by the year 2000.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"China","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/travel/l-china-571495.html","abstract":"  To the Editor: Having recently returned after nine and a half weeks in China, my wife and I found \"Seeing China Under Your Own Steam\" (Dec. 4) interesting.

Its word-of-mouth popularity with a mature, affluent-looking crowd makes it tough to get either a table or a parking space, even on slower weeknights.\n\nAfter tasting more than two dozen dishes on recent visits -- a cross section of the Italian-American menu -- we found that for every terrific dish, there was one that was not up to par. And that is what keeps the rating for this convivial, family-operated restaurant below its potential.\n\nPasta and seafood dishes are winners, while a few entrees, particularly veal preparations, leave something to be desired. Veal ortolana, for one, could be renamed veal Gucci, with its red and green salad topping and leathery breaded scaloppine. Portions are large, though, and the plate presentation is above average. Also, prices are not high. A complete dinner runs about $24, not counting tax, tip or wine. \n\nThe snug dining area was recently expanded to 85 seats by taking over the former deli's space next door, but the tables are still jammed. Despite being on time for our reservation recently, our fivesome was kept waiting in the tiny foyer for 35 minutes. Better management of the front of the house would help.\n\nOnce people are seated, the personable, bantering waiters in black tie keep things moving. The specials, though, are described accurately only about half of the time and never with prices.\n\nAmong the specials, two excellent choices that appear frequently are the rock shrimp appetizer -- succulent morsels crusty with herbs and spices and reminiscent of \"Cajun popcorn\" -- and pasta with Manila clams. In the latter, a shower of the steamed baby deep-sea clams with green-tinged shells, at once sweet and briny, are tossed with al dente linguine in a garlicky broth.\n\nA nice mix of young greens (misnamed \"Mesculine\" on the menu) in a good vinaigrette with shards of Parmesan outshines the dull Caesar salad, and tenderly plump escargots with shiitake mushrooms and toast points is a more successful combination than the one-note acidic brown sauce on sliced portobello mushrooms, which would be better left whole. Other starters include a trio of succulent shrimp with a tumble of white beans, and tortellini in brodo, meat-filled pasta afloat in a full-flavored broth.\n\nIn pollo balsamico, lightly sauteed chunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms are bathed in a very intense balsamic vinegar sauce. Penne, the quill-shape macaroni, tossed with sauteed eggplant cubes in a tomato and basil sauce with melted fontina cheese, is appealing.\n\n\nVegetables are included with most entrees, but a recommended side dish is the emerald-green spinach, only lightly sauteed, with a fragrant gloss of olive oil and cracklings of garlic.\n\nJoseph Meli, the chef who operates Primavera with his wife, Antonia, cooked at Il Tulipano in nearby Cedar Grove before going out on his own here three years ago.\n\nExcept for the de rigueur tiramisu, richly satisfying in a sundae dish, and the imported fruit sorbets in their natural shells, most of the desserts are brought in from a New York bakery. Although a cheesecake was leaden, a custardy profiterole cake drizzled with chocolate will suit the sweet tooth at the table. \n\nThe brief wine list contains a handful each of California, Italian and French bottles, like a Meridian chardonnay for $16 and a '91 Groth cabernet sauvignon for $26. There are off-list specials, like a 1988 Brunello di Montalcino for $40.\n Primavera \n\nGood \n\n500 Pleasant Valley Way, near Eagle Rock Avenue, West Orange.

Not Till Attitudes Change","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/sports/backtalk-sports-peace-in-our-time-not-till-attitudes-change.html","abstract":"  It is, perhaps, someday soon. A week from now, two weeks, a month, it is finally that unpostponable morning after that follows an unthinkable cancellation of the season. The exhilaration of those final frantic hours when, as owner or player, you stood proudly with your brethren and did what you had to do, is gone. Now it is done. Now nothing about hockey matters until September.   It is 5 years from now, or 10, and every year after that. You are a former player or owner, commissioner or executive director. You are a doer by nature; no thought sits long undirected in your mind, no feeling unchanneled, uncontrolled. But every time you see the line 1994-95 (No Season) you wince. You scramble and cover the wince, explaining to that holdout part of you why it happened, had to happen, how it was better that way, but you can never explain well enough. You see it; you wince.   Three days after, 5 or 10 years after, every year after that, was it worth it? Even remembering all the details of that time, everything that made you do what you did, but knowing the rest, too, would you still do it? Forget the effect on fans, sponsors, bottom lines and bank statements. Those you can argue any way you want. What about on you? How does it make you feel about you?   It is now. The owners, until yesterday, had been insisting on a salary cap or payroll tax. The players had refused. There was no common ground, \"no basis for agreement.\" Everybody was doing his job. Gary Bettman's was to get labor peace for the owners under a formula in which player salaries rise less precipitously. Bob Goodenow's was to build a player union strong and unified enough to resist, to allow the market to take salaries where they go. The problem needed only a nudge to start. Whose push turned to whose shove didn't matter. As with most strikes and lockouts, both sides wanted a fight.   Now, in light of yesterday's new offer by the owners, the question is: Do the two sides finally want to stop?   Issues don't divide, attitudes do. A partly cloudy day is mostly sunny if you decide to see it that way. When there is a will for war, fighting happens. When there is a will for peace, it stops. What can turn hockey's will for division into a will for agreement?   The fans have been remarkably patient. Supposedly passionate about their game and teams, they have done little picketing, issued few threats of future boycott. Perhaps it is because settlement (to them) has always seemed imminent; perhaps because for so long, the alternative game has seemed almost as exciting. Showdown meetings, team player against team owner, expressions of solidarity, not much that had \"Play of the Day\" potential, but something to talk about.   Yet the fans have been patient because they know their place. Players and owners can choose to play, or not play. The power is in their hands, and fans know that. They do not like it, but it's a power they respect. And between the fans, the players and the owners, some unexpressed bargain seems to have been struck. How much of a season you give me, a fan says, is your right. That you give me a season, is mine. Not because I have any power over that, but because it is right. Break the bargain, break the patience.   A sport seems unimaginably important during the early days of a strike or lockout. As days pass, it becomes clear how much greater fantasy is to any reality. Life does go on. Call the bluff, and you may get an answer you don't want to hear. What we always assumed was passion may have only been habit.   But the will to agreement needs a way, and the players and owners, until now, have found none. It may be they have been looking in the wrong place. They want to put this unrelenting squabbling behind them. They're tired, the fans are tired. Everyone needs to get on with it. Always fighting over who gets what share of the pie, they need peace to grow that pie. Years of it! But what is the formula, appropriate now, flexible enough to apply to all the changes of later, that both sides can live with? Basketball thought it had one; now its players don't think so, and they play the N.B.A. season looking for something new. Football and baseball are looking, too.   It's not there! That's the message of the length and vehemence of the baseball and hockey labor disputes.  History is moving in the players' direction; the owners want to stop the clock. For them, the future seems an impossibly difficult place. Next year is one thing; two, three, four years from now, they can see where the players are going and they can't see how they can get there themselves. But history isn't lived in four-year chunks. Today, you manage; tomorrow, you find a way. And tomorrow after that. There is no way that every baseball team in 1975 could survive this free agency era that has followed, and yet every team has.   The business of sport is changing too rapidly. The formula as solution is an illusion. Long-term interests, from the perspective of now, are too divided. If the search for formula continues through negotiation and seasons await the outcome, there will be no seasons. There isn't one team that can't survive until next year. Focus on four-year deals to put trouble behind you, and you put nothing but trouble in front of you. A four, five or six-year focus turns things ideological, hypothetical, rhetorical, makes the possible impossible. Yesterday's formula was power, and the owners had it. Now in all sports, there is a growing balance. It is hard to break the other guy, bring him to your way of thinking unless it is his way of thinking, too.   Deciding there must be either peace or war is disastrous. There is nothing wrong with muddling along. Maybe there will come a time when more is possible. If not, the parties still will have survived, the games will be played. And muddling along also forces players and owners to muddle together. In time, perhaps they will come to understand, trust, respect and get respect back, to work together and produce through the back door what neither side would tolerate through the front -- some form of cooperation.   It was time to fight; now, it's time to play. Time for Gary Bettman's and Bob Goodenow's job to be defined differently so that success for each is measured in a season played, in the 1995 Stanley Cup being won. So that neither side forces the other to carry the can of a bad deal, days and years later, having to wince even harder at that. Great performers in any activity have a sense of timing. Now, they realize, is when the game is being won and lost, now is when the big hit must be made, the goal must be scored. Now is when the deal must be done.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950108","headline":"The Prices Are Down and Business Is Up","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/nyregion/dining-out-the-prices-are-down-and-business-is-up.html","abstract":"  NOW you see it, now you don't.
