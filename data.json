Then he sat down, seemed to leave his nervousness behind, and proceeded with the help of his band to perform three rocking pieces that perfectly blended improvisation and arrangement with jazz and Afro-Cuban musical sources.   Mr. Perez is a smart and gifted pianist, and he has placed himself right at the nexus of several cultural streams. With his band, which includes David Sanchez on saxophones, Larry Grenadier on bass, Ignacio Berroa on drums and Kimati Dinizulu on percussion, he moves easily between the music of the Caribbean and the United States. In Mr. Perez's hands, rhythms constantly shift. And he sends cultural references flying. One minute a boogie-woogie figure spreads shadows over an Afro-Cuban riff, another Mr. Perez muffles the strings inside the piano with his left hand while playing a riff surrounded by a dense and static percussion barrage, only to slide the music gracefully into a deeply swinging section.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940505","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/sports/results-plus-994863.html","abstract":"  HORSE RACING Sky Beauty Returns to Winner's Circle  Sky Beauty made a successful return to racing yesterday, scoring a three-length victory over For All Seasons in the $81,425 Grade II Vagrancy Stakes for fillies and mares at Belmont Park.

(AP) AUTO RACING  Changes Are Detailed in Pit Lanes  Immediate changes to make pit lanes safer are to be made in the wake of last weekend's spate of accidents at the San Marino Grand Prix, the International Automobile Federation president, Max Mosley, announced yesterday. Mosley, speaking at a news conference after an emergency federation meeting following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola, said that effective with the Monaco Grand Prix May 15, a mechanism would be introduced at the entry and exits to pit lanes to force cars to slow down drastically. Three Ferrari mechanics and a Team Lotus employee were injured when struck by a car leaving a pit near the end of the San Marino race.

The memorial salute, which Dean Gann wrote on April 26 to send to Mr. Nixon's family, will serve as an alternative to the moment of silence that was sought in a petition from 105 (not counting the prankster who signed Henry Kissinger's name) of the 190 students graduating from the law school this weekend. An Uneasy History    Four decades ago, shortly after he became Vice President, the university offered Mr. Nixon an honorary degree, then rescinded the gesture because of an uprising by faculty members angered at what they saw as his history of nasty campaigning. Then, in 1961, Mr. Nixon turned the tables, rejecting a degree when the offer was renewed.   And in 1981, seven years after he was forced from the Presidency by the Watergate scandal, the university decided against allowing his Presidential library to be built on campus.    Against that backdrop of strain, the law school's faculty met yesterday to discuss whether to honor the school's most famous alumnus and, if so, how. There was no vote, Dean Gann said in a statement issued later; publication of the tribute was her decision.    \"The law school does not recognize the deaths of faculty, alumni or friends of the law school at its graduation,\" the dean said. \"An exception was made in this case because of the students' request and because President Nixon's death occurred so close in time to the graduation weekend. This particular method was chosen because the in memoriam statement provides a useful summary of Mr. Nixon's associations with the law school and his particular interest in foreign affairs in China, including the special efforts of the Duke Law School in the last 10 years to educate Chinese students about law and legal institutions.\"   Although the issue had not been the hottest one on the Duke campus, Kate Bartlett, senior associate dean of the law school, said some opposition to honoring Mr. Nixon had remained. \"It puts the law school in an awkward position,\" she said, \"where the failures of his life bear directly on our mission: the rule of law and the highest standards of ethics and accountability.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Baseball; Gallego Goads the Yankees With His Serious Thoughts","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/sports/baseball-gallego-goads-the-yankees-with-his-serious-thoughts.html","abstract":"  When Don Mattingly addressed his Yankee teammates last Friday in Oakland because their play had occasionally lacked desire, Mike Gallego was happy to hear the critical words.

In its panic, the Fed has raised interest rates three times, taking everyone by surprise. Long-term bondholders have lost billions and international currency markets have been rattled. Yet the Fed's economists admit they can't point to even a hint of inflation in the current numbers. They are missing the obvious: the 90's are likely to be an inflation-free decade, and their interest rate hikes will squash the current economic recovery.    The 70's and 80's were inflationary times. The failure to raise taxes to pay for the Vietnam War led to slowly accelerating inflation that exploded with the oil and food shocks of the 70's. Inflation stubbornly receded in the 80's. If the effects of surging health care costs are subtracted from inflation figures, it is clear that more prices have fallen than risen this spring.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"INSIDE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/nyregion/inside-001961.html","abstract":"  Israeli-P.L.O.

The story revolves around three elaborate dream sequences, stuffed with portentous Freudian imagery, that illustrate her repressed sexuality, her indecisiveness and her sense of shame.    \"Lady in the Dark\" revels in high-style Manhattan glamour, 1940's style. Moss Hart's book drips with famous names, chic references and characters gasping \"dahling\" to each other. Kurt Weill's delicious tunes, while retaining vestiges of the acerbic angularity of his German operas, well up with a giddy all-American buoyancy.

But many of the films are pretty good; most offer first-rate acting, and all of them provide, for anyone interested in Germany as opposed to German cinema, telling insights into what present-day Germans are fretting about.   Some of the Germans' concerns are specific to them: the reunification of their country and the difficulties that Easterners (\"Ossis\") and Westerners (\"Wessis\") have in comprehending one another; former terrorists coming in from the cold (a special interest of the post-1968 generation that now dominates German film), and the festering problem of neo-Nazi skinheads' violence and the hatred of foreigners.

While legislatures, courts and special commissions dither over whether to sanction doctor-assisted suicide, desperately ill patients are taking matters into their own hands. The jury's eagerness to find any loophole to exonerate Dr. Kevorkian suggests an underlying belief that patients have a \"right to die\" with dignity and to be assisted in their suicides by a willing doctor.   That right got another legal assist this week when a Federal district judge in Seattle ruled that a Washington State ban on assisted suicide was a constitutional infringement on individual liberty. The issue, which is also being contested in the state courts of Michigan, may be headed ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court. Some 30 states currently have laws against helping people kill themselves.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940506","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/arts/art-in-review-012920.html","abstract":"  Jock Sturges   Laurence Miller Gallery  138 Spring Street  SoHo  Through May 28    Three years ago Jock Sturges's photographs of nude adolescent girls made him the target of an F.B.I. raid in which agents, acting on suspicions that the photographer was producing child pornography, seized equipment, prints and negatives from his San Francisco apartment.

When Chuck Mangione came to Manhattan from Rochester in the 1960's, he and his brother Gap (Gaspare), a pianist, were leading a hard-bop group called the Jazz Brothers. The two brothers soon went their separate ways. Chuck Mangione played trumpet with Woody Herman, Maynard Ferguson and Art Blakey, and, switching to fluegelhorn, led one of the most popular jazz groups of the 1970's. For his appearance at the Blue Note, his first there in seven years, he will include a special \"Young People's Matinee\" tomorrow to which adults will be admitted only if they are accompanied by someone under 21. Admission is $20, plus a $5 minimum, for shows at 1 and 3:30 P.M. There are also to be the customary evening shows at 9 and 11:30 tonight, tomorrow night and Sunday night, with a $40 music charge at tables or $25 admission to the bar; there is also a $5 minimum at the tables and a one-drink minimum at the bar. Howard Prince Quintet    Howard Prince Quintet, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan (212) 582-2121. A broad range of influences come to bear on the trombonist Howard Prince's playing. These include such trombonists as his idol, J. J. Johnson, and his friend Jimmy Knepper, as well as performances on the bass trumpet in the Wagner \"Ring\" cycle with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. But it is the modal jazz emphasized by his mentor, the pianist and composer George Russell, that is, he says, crucial to his playing. His group, with the pianist Jon Davis, the guitarist Dave Moreno, the bassist Bryce Sebastien and the drummer Victor Jones, is to perform today and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. There is a $10 music charge at the tables or bar.  Carol Sloane    Carol Sloane, Fat Tuesdays, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Gramercy Park, (212) 533-7900. Carol Sloane's dark and husky voice burst on the jazz world when she was the unheralded star of the 1961 Newport Jazz Festival. Since then she has periodically disappeared from public view for several years and then renewed her singing career with a richer, deeper understanding of her art. She is settled in Massachusetts but makes regular visits to Fat Tuesdays, where she is to perform tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight, and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M.

She recently had a tough week. One day, she went to the aid of a neighbor whose son had been shot. Next, she pleaded with the leader of the gang in her building to hold off seeking revenge for the beating of a member -- she didn't want any shooting to start while children were coming home from school. The next day, she comforted the mother of a 14-year-old girl who had been shot in the head.\n\nHousing authorities nationwide have recognized that we will get a handle on violence only when we stop looking at projects as warehouses for the poor and start turning them into neighborhoods. But that is impossible when society's interest extends no further than protecting the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure -- a freedom that is an abstraction to parents who so fear stray bullets that they put their children to bed in a bathtub every night.\n\nNo one thinks police sweeps are the final answer. Everyone recognizes that getting a handle on the issue will involve tenant participation in managing and patrolling buildings. Many housing authorities are starting community policing efforts and focusing social service programs on particularly troubled projects. \n\nMany people, particularly Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, are saying high-rises should be torn down and replaced with low-rises or scattered-site housing. All this takes time and money that isn't always available. And it is hard to encourage people to act like neighbors when they're afraid to leave their apartments.\n\nFor now, the Chicago sweeps should at least clear away some fear -- sending the message that the authority hasn't abandoned the buildings and instilling some self-reliance and a recognition that a better way of life is possible. Plenty of Chicago Housing Authority residents will tell you that the day after a police sweep they feel freer than they have in a long time. There may be alternatives that accomplish the same purpose without running into constitutional issues. But if all we can summon the will to do is to tut-tut about excesses of authority, we will never find them.\n\nUntil we can look Brenda Bolden in the eye and say, \"This will make your life better,\" it is unprincipled to condemn people like those in the Chicago Housing Authority who have honestly been trying to do so.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940507","headline":"Joint Military Games Supported in Russia","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/07/world/joint-military-games-supported-in-russia.html","abstract":"  The Russian Defense Minister, Pavel S.

The nearly 30-year career of AMM, a British improvisational group that has been on a rare American tour the last few weeks, shows otherwise. Rooted in free jazz, AMM was famous at first for its association with Cornelius Cardew, one of the wild innovators of European composition in the 1960's and 70's. Its extraordinary first album (\"AMM Music,\" now reissued on ReR Records) came out on Elektra, with production help from associates of Pink Floyd. The group outlived its initial hype, survived Cardew's death in 1981 and has stuck to its esoteric avant-garde mission.   The core members remain Eddie Prevost, a drummer of extraordinary energy and inventiveness, and Keith Rowe, who draws the most unearthly sounds from an electric guitar laid out on a table. Their set on Tuesday night at Context Studios on the Lower East Side lasted about an hour; it ranged from minimal whispers of timbre to grinding, buzzing onslaughts. Mr. Rowe bent over the vibrating corpse of his guitar, manipulating metal implements and electronic gizmos. His favorite trick is to bring a transistor in proximity to the strings so that random radio transmissions show up like aural ghosts.

There were speeches, fanfares and guards of honor on both sides of the Straits of Dover to celebrate the completion of a $15 billion engineering triumph that is being compared to the Panama and Suez Canals. But today's opening was wholly ceremonial. Ordinary fare-paying travelers will not be able to use the tunnel until the fall, after the tunnel's safety systems are installed and tested.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940507","headline":"Bosnians Angry at U.S. and U.N. as New Battle Looms","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/07/world/bosnians-angry-at-us-and-un-as-new-battle-looms.html","abstract":"  A Bosnian Army officer, Mevludin Hasanovic, stood today in the small mosque here close to the most sensitive front line in the Bosnian war and delivered an impassioned message to the kneeling throng.   \"Clinton won't help you, Boutros-Ghali won't help you,\" Dr. Hasanovic declared, as the local mullah stood beside him. \"After Gorazde, we know that we must fight for victory alone, and Mohammed wants you all to give all you can for the battle.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940507","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/07/nyregion/no-headline-016578.html","abstract":"  I can't remember the first thing I said when I saw her.
