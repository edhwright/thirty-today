Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company is one of this country's most provocative and interesting modern dance troupes, even when operating at something less than full capability as it did on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea). The new dance on this second program of a two-week season was relatively minor. But the performing was as impressive as ever. And Mr. Jones and dancers still provide one of the few occasions when today's modern dance addresses social issues of the time theatrically, and does so with a cathartic passion.   \"There Were So Many\" takes its name from a haiku-like elegy for departed friends and for blossoms that have fallen from a tree that was concealed in the once-crowded landscape. Set to John Cage's \"Six Melodies for Violin and Keyboard,\" the new piece, which looked unfinished, managed to suggest a cast of hundreds, all dressed in soft white fatigues designed by Linda Pratt and Jean Claude Mastroianni. Ranged in lines, at four corners and in converging circles throughout the piece, the 12 dancers moved through their paces like robots trained in Baroque dance. The look was formal and ornamental. A few duets flecked the milling landscape like nubbles in woven fabric.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931022","headline":"City Incentives;\nTenements Are Rebuilt As Rentals","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/us/city-incentives-tenements-are-rebuilt-as-rentals.html","abstract":"Six months ago they were empty, trashed shells.

In an unusual, if not unique, joint venture tying Hollywood to the New York stage, Steven Spielberg has agreed to underwrite up to 10 playwriting commissions over the next two years for plays to be produced and developed by Playwrights Horizons. The commissions of between $7,000 and $12,000 each will go to young, emerging playwrights, the recipients to be chosen by and agreed upon by Don Scardino, artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, and Mr. Spielberg. For his investment, Mr. Spielberg is assured a first look at the play as a potential film property. That is, his production company, Amblin Entertainment, will have a chance to bid on each play's film rights.    If Amblin does make the film, the playwright is assured the assignment of writing the first and second drafts of the screenplay, and in addition, Playwrights Horizons will be involved, as associate producers, in the production, contributing to the creative development of the project and, just as important, participating in the profits. (The traditional arrangement is that the developing theater gets 40 percent of the writer's share.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19931022","headline":"Conner: The Whitbread's Sourdough","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/sports/IHT-conner-the-whitbreads-sourdough.html","abstract":"Dennis Conner was not a happy man. .Sailing's most identifiable competitor stepped off his scarlet racing yacht Winston with a scowl a bay wide.

Today an expurgated version of \"The Program\" arrives at the nation's theaters. The Walt Disney Company, whose subsidiary Touchstone produced the film, has deleted the scene. The decision is thoughtful, even pious, but it sets a terrible precedent. Having to worry about attracting an audience is tough enough.

(AP)   FIGURE SKATING  Harding Takes Lead  Tonya Harding of Portland, Ore., the 22-year-old former United States champion, skated the best technical program of her life last night to take the lead after the preliminariy program at Skate America in Dallas over the reigning world champion, Oksana Bayul of Ukraine. Harding skated deliberately but cleanly last night, landing a triple Lutz, double-toe combination, a double loop and a double axel. The four-minute long program will count for 66 percent of the total score.

This by no means ends American involvement in a United Nations operation, since 6,300 U.S. troops remain in Somalia, and 3,600 U.S. marines are deployed offshore. But Mr. Clinton seems finally to realize that commando raids and the civilian deaths that result from them can't cure what is ailing Somalia.    Taken together, the changed approach suggests that Mr. Clinton has heeded an aroused Congress and widespread bafflement over a humanitarian mission that by degrees turned into a bloody vendetta. Washington's new course does not mean Americans reject U.N. peacekeeping, but rather its muddled misapplication.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"Senate Ethics Panel Seeking To View Packwood Diaries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/us/senate-ethics-panel-seeking-to-view-packwood-diaries.html","abstract":"  The Senate ethics committee's inquiry into accusations of sexual misconduct by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon boiled over today into a public feud over whether the panel has an unfettered right to read the Senator's voluminous private diaries.

That has suddenly changed. On Thursday night, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, led by the trumpeter Jon Faddis through a group of tunes associated with Benny Goodman, gave notice that arrangements are no longer sacrosanct. Where other repertory groups might change the emphasis in an interpretation, or open up solo space beyond the constraints of the original three-minute recording of a piece, the Carnegie Hall band radically rewrote the material.   The historical and creative liberty the band took comes not a moment too soon. It happened during the second half of the show, when the band began to play some Goodman tunes newly arranged by its pianist, Jim McNeely. It started with \"Air Mail Special,\" then moved into \"Stompin' at the Savoy\" and \"King Porter Stomp.\" Each of these pieces featured odd touches, and some nice, sly dissonances that seemed to cram too many notes into too small a space; \"King Porter Stomp\" had two clarinets harmonizing on the melody.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"Administration Is Fighting Itself On Haiti Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/world/administration-is-fighting-itself-on-haiti-policy.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration appears to be at war with itself over policy toward Haiti and the Haitian leader supported by the White House, the Rev.

The opera, \"Stiffelio,\" written between \"Luisa Miller\" and \"Rigoletto,\" disappeared from the world's stages soon after its 1850 premiere not because it was a musical failure, but because its story about a Protestant minister who discovers his wife's infidelity fell afoul of the Roman Catholic censors.

Wearing long, studded tunics, with daggers at their waists, the Georgians harmonized on work songs, Christian hymns, humorous songs and traditional toasts. In many songs, two voices converged and separated over a drone note, sometimes in a dulcet parallel third, sometimes veering toward combinations that sound dissonant to Western ears. The voices could be hushed and ethereal with little vibrato, as in medieval music, or clear and hearty. Then, suddenly, a downward slide or a yelp or a yodel would make clear that the choir had its own sonic traditions. There were antiphonal songs, filled with non-Western asymmetry; a comic song, similar to children's songs from elsewhere, had a fast, ever-expanding patter section and vivid animal noises.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"ADRs Avoid the Hassle In Investing Overseas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/your-money/IHT-adrs-avoid-the-hassle-in-investing-overseas.html","abstract":"SUPPOSING you have ferreted out a specific emerging market stock, and you're thinking about going direct to its home exchange in São Paulo or Jakarta to buy shares.

Ten people were killed: one of the IRA bombers, a UDA member and eight Protestant civilians, two of whom were children. More than fifty people were wounded.

And they are crisscross-laced with about a dozen flat-wound, cotton athletic shoestrings, in sky blue, purple, argyle or gold, tied in large, loose, loopy bows. WHERE THEY'RE FOUND: On the 53-year-old feet of George Clinton, the zany godfather of funk music. The foot-stomping, blues-based, rock-and-R-and-B-fused sound has made him the funkiest man on the planet (and sometimes off). And so go his shoes.   The shoes are also featured in the album art of Mr. Clinton's latest recording, \"Hey Man . . . Smell My Finger,\" on Prince's Paisley Park Records. (And Prince is someone else with a fetish for uplifting footwear.) WHAT THEY REALLY, REALLY ARE: Attitude with sole. Like Elvis's (late Vegas period) oversize belt buckle, Louis Armstrong's handkerchief, James Brown's conked kinks and the omnipresent scarf that Aerosmith's Steven Tyler clings to when he sings, Mr. Clinton's shoes, no matter which ones he wears, are a show-biz-hyped distillation and projection of his style. And what a style: from a pair of five-inch-high platform sneakers to feathered, mid-calf-length, hand-stitched trapper boots.   Mr. Clinton, a former hairdresser in Newark who likes to wear his hair these days in a freaked-out, funny fright wig of braids, tresses and coiled multicolored yarn, was recently quoted in Interview magazine as saying, \"I can wear any style -- or have no style -- and it doesn't bother me.\" WHY: Funk feeds the deep nostalgia of inner-city baby boomers and the insatiable hunger of members of the hip-hop generation, who've sampled songs like Mr. Clinton's \"Atomic Dog,\" \"Flash Light\" and \"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)\" with abandon and reverence. And thus Mr. Clinton is high-stepping the pace of his almost-30-year recording career.   A resurgence of 1970's-era disco and funk music is also sweeping the nation, stirring a storm of interest and dollars in Mr. Clinton's various musical incarnations, including his solo act and his role as leader of the eccentric Parliament-Funkadelic funk mob. Re-releases of early albums are planned, as well as a major Clinton tour, record executives said. ADDITIONAL CLINTON PROPS: Funky eye wear, diapers, United States Army-surplus fatigues, chains, rings, wacky T-shirts, knit caps, broad-brimmed hats, capes, cloaks, face paint and, of course, his concert flying saucer, the Mothership. SHOE-IN: Mr. Clinton's ability to transform the ordinary -- like the pair of boxing shoes -- into a highly personalized statement \"speaks to his strength as an artist,\" said Susan Nininger, the Los Angeles-based costume designer who was the stylist on Mr. Clinton's \"Smell My Finger\" album shot and provided the shoes.   \"I was basically asked to bring the wildest stuff I could find and he would be able to wear it,\" she continued. \"I let my imagination go and meld with his outrageousness, and it worked.\" CLINTON'S STYLE CREDO: \"Colors don't clash; people do,\" from Mr. Clinton's new single, \"Paint the White House Black.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Barbara Nonas, Robert Hunter Jr.","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/style/weddings-barbara-nonas-robert-hunter-jr.html","abstract":"  Barbara Nonas, a daughter of Dr. Gerson Nonas of New York and the late Marjorie Crystal Nonas, was married yesterday to Robert Wallace Hunter Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs. Hunter of Sarasota, Fla.

This is the calm setting for the surprisingly modern metropolitan area of five million. In contrast to the chaos found in many big Latin cities, Santiago has a distinct sense of order, along with the flavors of colonial antiquity. Founded by Pedro de Valdivia in 1541, it has benefited from Chile's economic boom over the last four years. The city is easy to get around, has the most up-to-date technology and infrastructure available in Latin America and is relatively safe for travelers.    On a clear day, the mountains around the city can be a shimmering sight of brown topped with white, as they rise above the modern buildings from a thin brown haze at the edge of the city. But a view of the mountains, particularly in winter, is never guaranteed, since in June, when winter begins in the Southern Hemisphere, the city is often troubled by smog.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Elizabeth Katz And Peter Xilas","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/style/weddings-elizabeth-katz-and-peter-xilas.html","abstract":"  Elizabeth Mindy Katz, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Melvin J.

The contrasting textures, shadings and points of view of the 213 crisp black-and-white photographs arouse much esthetic pleasure. But beyond his delight in form, the photographer seems to have stared at surfaces to capture substances and scrutinized the esthetics of characters for clues about their identities and contexts. Toward the end of the book, Mr. Friedlander, whose previous photography books include \"The Jazz People of New Orleans\" and \"Like a One-Eyed Cat,\" shows complete words and sentences: some graphically advertise the stuff of everyday life (chicken, a shoeshine parlor, books); most express beliefs and yearnings. From a white wall, an elongated black \"Sin\" heckles passers-by; a black-marker diatribe against Ronald Reagan defiles a model's smiling face; messages about love and sex are shouted in spray paint or whispered in tiny scratches.

White Plains was once a Republican stronghold, but Democrats gained control of the Common Council two years ago.

Mayor Del Vecchio, who lost the primary by 85 votes, is running on the Conservative line. He is still a popular figure in White Plains and will undoubtedly attract votes. The Republican candidate, Michael Coffey, a Common Council member for 18 years and owner of a moving and storage company, will be competing with Mr. Del Vecchio for both Conservative and Republican support. Reaping the benefits of the division may be the Democratic candidate, Sy J.

The work, in which Israeli Jews, Palestinian Moslems, and Americans are given a sort of religious Rorschach test about the patriarch Abraham and his immediate family, includes ritualistic chanting from the Hebrew Scriptures by an Ethiopian Jew, Ephraim Isaac. By tradition, each word in the Hebrew text carries fixed melodic tropes, but Mr. Isaac's chant was unlike any I have heard. Its sinuous ornamentation was marked by strong, irregular accents; the chant was clearly influenced by African and Middle Eastern music.   One preoccupation of Mr. Reich and his wife, Beryl Korot, who created the video portions of \"The Cave,\" is the transformations and interpretations of sacred texts, including such traditional musical settings as Mr. Isaac's. The authors explore how tales are understood and misunderstood by Arabs, Jews and Americans. And while \"The Cave\" does not live up to its promise to illuminate contemporary mythologies -- only the bluntest distinctions can be made in the sound bites coming from the video screens -- its ambition is intriguing.

With its spacious front yards, green shade trees and porticoed doorways on respectably sized homes, Tyler seems like the essence of modern Southern gentility. On a recent Sunday afternoon, the manicured lawns are strangely empty; the streets are eerily quiet, and the broad intersections are bereft of traffic. The weather is hot and bright like Indian summer, but most of Tyler seems to be locked away behind closed doors.   In the amphitheater of the public park, though, a small crowd of hippie-generation couples, plus assorted aunts and uncles and cousins, has gathered for what is surely an unusual event by Tyler standards: a free outdoor concert by the Texas singer and songwriter Jimmie Dale Gilmore. But then Mr. Gilmore is not your typical country performer. For years he has been one of Texas's best-kept secrets. An Austin resident in his late 40's, he has only recently begun to emerge into the national spotlight. His show in Tyler is the first stop on a two-month national tour in support of his new album, \"Spinning Around the Sun\" on Elektra. (The tour arrives in New York this week for three shows Tuesday through Thursday at the Ballroom.)","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"IN SHORT: NONFICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/24/books/in-short-nonfiction-288293.html","abstract":"  HUMOR  A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN . . .

Photographs that masquerade as art, acting as grand and self-assured as paintings, or leading a piecemeal, hybrid existence in paintings or sculpture or installations, are right in the center of things, and gallery walls fairly teem with them. This story of photography's incorporation and metamorphosis into art amplifies a recurrent theme of this century: a marginal form -- welded metal, factory-made artifacts, rhythm and blues -- shifts into prominence, even predominance.   \"Photographic: Works of the 60's and 70's,\" at the Zabriskie Gallery through Saturday, assembles examples of the many ways photography has progressed through the halls of art and into its living quarters. A couple of museum shows have presented the subject more comprehensively -- \"Photographic\" has only about three dozen objects -- and some have been more generous to photographers than this show, which deals mainly with artists who experimented with cameras. But several of the pieces here are quite satisfying and instructive, and the show touches enough bases to suggest that when photography took up residence in art's inner sanctum, the look of things shifted in just about every direction at once.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931024","headline":"Norah K.
