The film, which opens the Joseph Papp Public Theater's 1994 Italian Summer Festival tonight at 8:05, is remarkably similar in look and pacing to the Broadway musical adaptation except for one crucial difference. The character of Fosca, the ugly, ailing woman who conceives an obsessive passion for Giorgio, a handsome 19th-century cavalry officer, was softened for the Broadway musical.   The difference between Valeria D'Obici's movie portrayal of Fosca and Donna Murphy's performance is the difference between commedia dell'arte and Chekhov, between Margaret Hamilton in \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Olivia de Havilland in \"The Heiress.\" The scenes in which Miss D'Obici's bony, hollow-eyed Fosca throws herself at Bernard Giraudeau's dashing Giorgio lend the film an undertone of gallows humor. The character is a leering, voracious symbol of death. Ms. Murphy's lush voice and air of mournful abjection, deepened by Mr. Sondheim's yearning music, makes Fosca seem more romantically tragic than scary. The two performances are equally powerful in their very different ways.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940624","headline":"WHAT THEY'RE READING","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/24/style/IHT-what-theyre-reading.html","abstract":"-.

Though the U.S. delegate praised France's \"bold\" and \"noble offer,\" it has been generally opposed by human rights and humanitarian groups, and has been assailed by the rebel Patriotic Front, whose leaders are mostly Tutsis.    It is obviously risky for the Security Council to approve a peacekeeping force that is viewed as a mortal enemy by one side in the very war the U.N. is striving to end. France insists that its 2,500 or so troops will not occupy territory but will only try to save threatened civilians for a two-month interim period, then turn over peacekeeping tasks to an all-African force. But as the Somalia experience attests, \"humanitarian\" mandates tend to expand very rapidly, and to prevent another debacle France needs to be held to its word.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940624","headline":"Terry Murray Hired to Coach the Flyers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/24/sports/sports-people-hockey-terry-murray-hired-to-coach-the-flyers.html","abstract":"  The Philadelphia Flyers yesterday named the former Washington Capitals coach and former Flyers defenseman TERRY MURRAY as the team's head coach.

With the recent death of another friend, Kristen Pfaff, the bassist in Courtney Love's band, Hole, it seems as if the group could spend the rest of its career dedicating albums to absent friends.   Understandably, when the band performed on Saturday night at CBGB, its rock-and-roll was forged from anger and hate, and delivered in the form of threats and accusations.

Stockton's father won the tournament in 1974 and is currently leading the PGA Seniors Championship at Dearborn, Mich., after also shooting two 66's. The younger Stockton had a bogey and five birdies to finish 36 holes at eight-under-par 132. David Frost shot a 68 for 133 and sole possession of second over the 6,820-yard Tournament Players Club at River Highlands. He was seven under after 12 holes but missed a chance to tie Stockton when he double bogeyed No. 4. Five golfers were at 134, including Greg Norman, who shot a bogey-free 65. Stockton, in his first year on the PGA Tour, has missed the cut in 16 tournaments and hasn't placed higher than 30th in the other six. Last year, he earned $64,214 to place 23d on the Nike Tour.

The need for novelty remains critical in an era without popular new operas, and the Russian repertory from Glinka to Schnittke infuses accessible Western forms with a primal communal vitality. These operas offer the sort of heady exoticism that appealed to Diaghilev's Western audiences before World War I and the same cosmic yearnings heard today in the mystical Minimalism of Eastern Europe.

Or to contemplate anything? This is not the coast to bring on oblivion, or even the impulse to strip and bask and swim. It is too dramatic. And it is often too cold, particularly when the summer fog is in. Even at the warmest times of year -- spring and fall -- it is never hot there. The few hardy people one sees in the rough, icy water are wearing wet suits and carry surfboards. Many beaches are deserted, some inaccessible by land.

It was an era when amateur baseball among adult men thrived, mainly in industrial leagues and in twilight leagues, in Hartford, West Haven and Stamford. In addition, strong semipro teams like the Savitt Gems in Hartford, the Meriden Insilicos, the West Haven Sailors, the New Britain Cremos, the Waterbury Barons and the Stamford Pioneers drew big crowds to their games, many of them against famous barnstorming teams, including some from the old Negro leagues.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940626","headline":"Best Students' Needs Regaining Attention","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/nyregion/best-students-needs-regaining-attention.html","abstract":"THE number of public schools offering special instruction for the brightest and most creative students is increasing again, educators say, after a serious decline caused by state budget cuts in recent years.\n\nIn restoring programs for children identified as academically gifted or artistically talented -- usually the top 5 percent of students in each category -- school officials have made two important changes: they depend only on local tax dollars for support, and they have embraced a less elitist philosophy that calls for greater challenges for all students in the regular classroom.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940626","headline":"Journal; The Gay Card","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/opinion/journal-the-gay-card.html","abstract":"  \"Jane Alexander defends the slopping around of AIDS-infecting blood!\" shouted Representative Robert Dornan of California on the House floor on Thursday.

Here is a remote, rural California of quiet country towns, fairgrounds and wildflowers, verdant farms and tidy orchards stretching off to distant mountains, majestic redwoods and, finally, the craggy Mendocino coast and the cold, vast Pacific.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19940626","headline":"The Face of AIDS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/books/in-short-nonfiction-the-face-of-aids.html","abstract":"  In their striking collections of photographs of men, women and children affected by AIDS, Carolyn Jones and Sal Lopes capture, with compassion and dignity, the faith, optimism and grief prompted by illness. The images are moving and at times anguished, but the faces depicted in both books convey hope and fortitude far more than sadness. For LIVING PROOF: Courage in the Face of AIDS (Abbeville, $19.95), Ms. Jones, a New York fashion photographer, asked people who are H.I.V. positive to pose in her studio with an object or person that meant a great deal to them. The symbolism speaks for itself -- a close-up of two hands entwined, a mother embracing her daughter, a young man straightening his tie to prepare for whatever comes next. Her subjects' comments focus less on the pain of loss than on the determination, verve and spirit of renewal that they need to live. Almost without exception, their goal is to enjoy the life that remains, and the ultimate effect of these powerful portraits is surprisingly upbeat. In LIVING WITH AIDS: A Photographic Journal (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $24.95), Mr. Lopes chronicles three related stories. First, he illustrates the emotional -- and political -- impact of AIDS by depicting the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt as it was unfurled during demonstrations in Washington in 1988 and 1992. Candid shots show mourners touching, lying sprawled across and even wrapped around sections of the quilt. In the next section, Mr. Lopes, the author of \"The Wall: Images and Offerings From the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,\" records the bonds that develop between AIDS patients and the volunteers assigned, through a community \"buddies\" program, to help them through their illness. The agonizing immediacy of these dual portraits -- in many cases the AIDS patients are visibly close to death -- carries a message of courage and mutual support. The final section tells the story of John and Sharon Boyce and their daughter Brianna, adopted when she was 3 years old and already suffering from AIDS. Brianna is heart-wrenchingly lovely, even in her frailty; in a postscript we learn she died last June, at the age of 7.
