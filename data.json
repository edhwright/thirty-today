Today, monastic hospitality is also extended to tourists, who are attracted by the low price tag, the secluded medieval ambiance and the unspoiled locations.Spain has several dozen monasteries and nunneries that accept guests, many in sites of great natural beauty.    Most such religious establishments in Spain are geared toward modern travelers, but some monasteries and nunneries open their doors to either men or women only and limit guests to those who genuinely seek solitude and retreat. None require participation in religious activities although punctuality for meals and respect for the monastic way of life are requested.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Charmaine Beepot and David Evans","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/style/engagements-charmaine-beepot-and-david-evans.html","abstract":"  Mr. and Mrs. Lothian Beepot of Hyde Park, Mass., have announced July wedding plans for their daughter Charmaine Marie Beepot and David Carmichael Evans, a son of James C.

A secondary advantage is that while your call to the C.D.C. is a toll call to Atlanta, the Government pays the cost of transmitting the fax sheets to you in return. A drawback is that if you receive faxes at a shop that charges for each sheet, you do not know before you order how many sheets there will be, and there may be as many as 10.

They are the famous automates, the three mechanical puppets of the Museum of Art and History in Neuchatel.   The cleverest of the three figures is the Scribe, a life-size barefoot boy, 3 or 4 years of age, who is seated at a mahogany desk.  Wielding a goose quill, he tips it in an inkwell and with perfect penmanship writes a short text while his eyes attentively follow the tracing of each letter. His movements are a bit jerky, but surprisingly lifelike. The second figure, also a little boy, in a reddish-brown jacket, is known as the Draftsman. Interchangeable sets of rotating cams tell the puppet to draw; he blows dust off the drawing paper by means of a bellows concealed in his head. The Musician, the central figure, is larger than the other two, representing a teen-age girl with blond curls wearing an elegant blue-and-gold dress. She plays rococo tunes on a period instrument described as an orgue-clavecin, a cross between a harpsichord and a harmonium. She seems to breathe as her chest heaves, she moves her head and eyes, and at the end gets up and makes a graceful bow. The effect is eerie.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Sheryl Kurtz, J. B.

In 1986, she started nursing school and completed training as a drug abuse counselor. Two years later Ms. Baker was hired as a counselor at the women's prison and began to pioneer several programs. But by then she had become ill with an aggressive form of cancer, gradually forcing her to come to work on crutches and later in a wheelchair.

M. Dawn's new album. \"This\" is the sound of turntables scratching above four different vamps, and the answer to the question is clearly \"hip-hop.\" But in the hands of P. M. Dawn and Basehead, both of whom have just released their second albums, and of performers like Arrested Development, Me Phi Me, Divine Styler and Papa's Culture, the borders of hip-hop have grown fuzzy. Now there's not only hip-hop that speaks to urban teen-agers but hip-hop for students and suburban slackers, for dreamers and for lovers.   The music is no longer just the public sound of street parties and booming car stereos; it can also be the private, playful, sometimes trippy results of musicians toying with instruments and samples and words. Instead of the stark rhymes and basic funk of old-school rap, some hip-hop embraces melody, digressions and introspection. Without speculating on the musicians' drug predilections -- though Michael Ivey regularly mentions smoking joints on Basehead's \"Not in Kansas Anymore\" (Imago 72787 21016; cassette and CD) -- the music might be called psychedelic hip-hop. Old hippies would appreciate its open-ended forms, free-associative lyrics and earphone-friendly solipsism.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"The Big Rigs That Give Kids a Big Thrill","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/nyregion/the-big-rigs-that-give-kids-a-big-thrill.html","abstract":"  \"BIG Truck Day is kind of a spiritual thing for my boy it's the zen of trucks,\" Kathie Swenson said, as she watched Mac, her 3-year-old son, climb into the driver's seat of a huge yellow backhoe and pretend to drive. \"I'm not sure if we fantasize at his age,\" she said, \"but if we do, Big Truck Day is it for him.\"    The concept of this event is simple.

From John Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\" to Caryl Churchill's \"Top Girls,\" from Alan Ayckbourn's \"Absurd Person Singular\" to David Hare's \"Plenty,\" there is hardly a modern English play of any significance (or insignificance) in which the characters are not sniffing out one another's class signals as if to establish who is the mongrel and who the pedigree poodle.   Seldom can that have been more obviously the case than in Willy Russell's \"Blood Brothers,\" the musical opening on Broadway next Sunday at the Music Box Theater. Liverpool twins who are separated as infants accidentally meet and become friends. Mickey (played by Con O'Neill) is brought up in poverty, goes to an inferior school, loses his dead-end job and slips into crime. Edward (Mark Michael Hutchinson) rises to local eminence, thanks to a posh education and all the advantages of wealth. But can the affinity they feel when they meet transcend the built-in bitterness of class? Part folk tale, part social document, \"Blood Brothers\" tries to answer that question. With Stephanie Lawrence as the tormented mother, the show also features music and lyrics by the author.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Public & Private; What You See","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/opinion/public-private-what-you-see.html","abstract":"  I remember visiting an apartment in Brooklyn several years ago that had almost no furniture except for two televisions.

The TV provided background music to fractious family life and copacetic child care, little eyes glassy in the reflected glare.    But it also brought the world into a place where most people were afraid to go out after nightfall. Or at least the slice of the world that television shows, which had about as much to do with the life of this family as an Amy Fisher mini-series has to do with \"Masterpiece Theater.\" The image of the two televisions stayed with me, a symbol of how powerful TV is in the lives of so many families just like that one.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Medieval Riches of El Cid's City","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/travel/medieval-riches-of-el-cids-city.html","abstract":"BURGOS, about 150 miles north of Madrid, has long been a stopover for serious travelers in northern Spain. Hemingway would visit to watch a bullfight and to dine on trout from the Rio Arlanzon, Castilian roast lamb, and the \"delicate Burgos cheese\" that he used to bring to Gertrude Stein in Paris. Others -- Alexandre Dumas, Hans Christian Andersen, James A. Michener -- usually stayed long enough to see the great Gothic Catedral de Burgos and pay their respects to El Cid, Spain's national hero. \n\nBurgos's location -- at the junction of the main road from France and the east-west Camino de Santiago, the great pilgrim route of the Middle Ages -- helps account for its wealth of historic sites and medieval ambiance. Yet with only 160,000 inhabitants, Burgos has the atmosphere of a small town, and most attractions are within or in walking distance of its beautifully restored old quarter, leaving plenty of time to enjoy the fine Spanish art of \"doing nothing,\" as the 19th-century English writer Richard Ford once observed. Watching the people parade on the Espolon, reading a book in an outdoor cafe, ferreting out little shops and tapas bars in the back streets, stopping along one of the bridges to watch trout fishermen and admiring the dramatic lighting of the monuments on nightly strolls to the city's relaxed restaurants are perfect counterpoints to the historical riches of Burgos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Republicans Hold Clinton Accountable; Senate Childishness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/opinion/l-republicans-hold-clinton-accountable-senate-childishness-577893.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   Our Government should not be run by filibuster.

Watching the people parade on the Espolon, reading a book in an outdoor cafe, ferreting out little shops and tapas bars in the back streets, stopping along one of the bridges to watch trout fishermen and admiring the dramatic lighting of the monuments on nightly strolls to the city's relaxed restaurants are perfect counterpoints to the historical riches of Burgos.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Paris Has Burned","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/style/paris-has-burned.html","abstract":"  LOOKING like endangered birds, the drag queens tottered on their heels as they entered -- \"a bit early in the day for we girls,\" said one.

The son of wealthy and adoring parents, he was forced to flee Russia with the rest of the family after the Bolshevik revolution, then to flee Europe as the Nazis closed in. Yet, as this first volume of Brian Boyd's biography shows, neither turmoil nor subsequent poverty impeded his writing. \"Nabokov's life reads like a work by a very imaginative creator,\" Sergei Davydov said here in 1990. \"Mr. Boyd gives us that life and ventures many shrewd glimpses beyond it. As a biography his book can hardly be surpassed.\" Princeton University has also reissued Mr. Boyd's second volume, VLADIMIR NABOKOV: The American Years ($16.95), an exploration of the two decades Nabokov spent in the United States.

It is a retrospective of work from the last 30 years by Melvin Edwards. The sculptor, who welds his steel pieces out of a studio in Plainfield, N.J., is gaining a growing nationwide reputation as a mature talent with urgent things to say.\n\nMr. Edwards is a large, powerful-looking man whose works are clear records of that strength. The show contains a videotape of him in his alien-looking welder's gear, fusing various metal objects together; it is obvious how readily the forms flow out of the person. The pieces he works on in the video are from his much-discussed series titled \"Lynch Fragments.\" There are 70 of these compressed works in the show, and the way they are arrayed one after the other on the gallery walls reminds one of a string of bullet holes made by an outsized antiaircraft gun. \n\n\"Lynch Fragments\" is not a pretty title, and the works are meant to disturb; but they also fascinate and elicit an occasional laugh. They range from the essentially frontal and symmetrical \"Afro Phoenix No. 2\" (1964) to the exercise in loose and loopy forms that is \"Dry Days\" (1992). Variety results from the deft way that the artist shepherds his arsenal of materials, which includes heavy chains, blacksmith nails, scissors and even horseshoes, which portend either good luck or bad depending on the way they are turned.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"A Blessing on Your Head","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/a-blessing-on-your-head.html","abstract":"  THE MAN IN THE BOWLER HAT   His History and Iconography.

In flimsy machines built of cloth, wood and wire, the new knights of the air engaged in one-on-one combat during World War I in which skill and luck combined to create a different form of chivalry. LEGEND, MEMORY AND THE GREAT WAR IN THE AIR (Smithsonian Institution/University of Washington, cloth, $34.95; paper, $18.95) both debunks and enriches the myths that developed almost immediately around military aviation. The authors -- Dominick A. Pisano, a curator in aeronautics at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, and Thomas J. Dietz, Joanne M. Gernstein and Karl S. Schneide, all curatorial assistants at the museum -- describe how military commanders developed the strategies that remain part of the doctrine of air warfare to this day, how they learned through trial and error what was effective, and how aviators lost their lives as the subjects of these experiments. The book also details how myths about aerial combat were formulated in contemporary propaganda, posters for movies made a half-generation after the war, and the misty-eyed memoirs of aces. \"Legend, Memory and the Great War in the Air\" is a concise synopsis of the origin of a modern form of combat and its impact on our culture.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"Electoral Reform Is the Focus of Italian Referendums","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/world/electoral-reform-is-the-focus-of-italian-referendums.html","abstract":"  Italians vote in a series of referendums on Sunday and Monday that ostensibly chart the nation's future but also provide a chance to pass a verdict on its past.

Still, Hollywood cartoons can impinge on a nerve, activating reservoirs of shame and secret longing, tapping into inadmissible impulses, in the process providing a release for moral and sexual anxiety in much the way that horror movies are said to release other types of tension. Consider \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Basic Instinct\" and, with an opening-week gross of $25 million, the current leading box-office attraction, \"Indecent Proposal,\" a film that begins in the soft focus of a Kotex ad, and goes on to prove that nothing is sacred.   The picture's evocative title instantly telegraphs the link it draws between sex and money, the two issues that even the most sanguine individuals are least sanguine about. This combination is examined through a premise that is as bogus as it is intriguing: can a middle-class marriage survive after a devoted wife sells herself for an evening to a stunning-but-lonely billionaire winsomely played by a guarded-yet-tender Robert Redford? Or, to recycle the question Erich Segal posited more than 25 years ago, does being in love really mean never having to say you're sorry?","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930418","headline":"A Reasoned Verdict in Los Angeles","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/opinion/a-reasoned-verdict-in-los-angeles.html","abstract":"  The two Los Angeles police officers convicted in the Rodney King beating committed national crimes.

A city and nation that were alarmed over the beating and torn by riots after last year's state trial are entitled to a new national, collective sense of relief that due process has prevailed.

Shcherbo, who won six gold medals at the Barcelona Olympics, added the vault and parallel bars titles to the all-around championship he had won Thursday.  Miller, a 16-year-old high school student from Edmond, Okla, floundered on the beam, one of her strongest events, and finished last. But the American won a gold in the floor exercises to add to the all-round and uneven bars titles she had already won. The American women's team wound up with three golds, all won by Miller, and two silver medals won by Dominique Dawes. (AP) TENNIS  Sampras Is King Kong of Hong Kong  Pete Sampras, the world's top-ranked player, won a showdown with second-ranked Jim Courier yesterday, beating the former No. 1 player, 6-3, 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-2), to win the Salem Open in Hong Kong. Sampras, who took over Courier's top ranking last week when he won the Japan Open, won the first set with a service break in the sixth game. Courier squandered two break points in the sixth game of the second set. Both Americans held their serves, with Courier winning the tie breaker, 7-1. Courier saved a match point in the 12th game of the third set to force another tie breaker, but this time it was the 21-year-old Sampras who won it with ease. Sampras hit 15 aces in the final, which lasted nearly three hours. He now has a 7-2 record in matches against Courier.  (AP) A Title for Goellner: Marc Goellner of Germany won his first career title by coming from behind to beat Ivan Lendl, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, in the final of the Nice Open in France. It was the first final on the ATP Tour for the 6-foot-6-inch Goellner, ranked 95th in the world. He had never gotten past the quarterfinals of a pro event before Nice. It was the 143d career final for Lendl, who has won 92 titles.  Goellner had to win three qualifying matches to get into the main draw. He reached the final with a victory over top-seeded Stefan Edberg. Yesterday, Lendl broke Goellner's serve three times in the first set. But after that, Goellner did not lose another serve. In the second set, the 23-year-old Goellner broke Lendl, 33, in the fifth game to take a 3-2 lead and hold it for the rest of the set to even the match. (AP) MARATHON  Martin Is the Man of the Hours  Eamonn Martin of Britain, running in his first marathon, broke free in a dramatic sprint over the last 100 yards to beat Isidro Rico of Mexico and win the London Marathon yesterday. The women's race also went down to the wire with defending champion Katrin Dorre of Germany sprinting away from Lisa Ondieki of Australia over the last 1,000 yards for the victory. The 34-year-old Martin ran shoulder-to-shoulder with Rico over the last four miles before showing the kick that had made him a Commonwealth champion. The winning time was 2 hours 10 minutes 50 seconds. Rico clocked 2:10.53 for second, while Gajdus Grzegorz of Poland was third in 2:11.07. Dorre finished in 2:27.09. Ondieki clocked 2:27.27 and the Briton Liz McColgan 2:29.37. (AP) SOCCER  Team Needs to Practice Celebrating  Steve Morrow scored the winning goal yesterday as Arsenal defeated Sheffield Wednesday, 2-1, to win England's League Cup. But victory had a price, as Morrow ended up being carried from the field with an injury that was sustained when he was tossed in the air in celebration. Morrow's winning goal came in the 68th minute and was his first for Arsenal. But when his teammates tossed him into the air after the game, they failed to catch him. And as they accepted the trophy, Morrow was carried off the field on a stretcher with an oxygen mask over his face. It was later determined that he had broken an arm. Sheffield Wednesday went ahead, 1-0, on a goal by the American John Harkes in the ninth minute. But Arsenal got the equalizer in the 18th minute when Paul Merson volleyed home a curling 25-yard shot. Harkes, of Kearny, N.J., became the first American to score a goal in a Wembley Stadium final. Two years ago, he became the first American to play in a Wembley final. The two teams will meet again in the final of the more prestigious FA Cup final at Wembley on May 15. (AP) Canada Stays Unbeaten: Canada, behind John Catliff's two second-half goals, beat Honduras, 3-1, yesterday to remain in first place in its qualifying group for the 1994 World Cup. The victory, before a sellout crowd of 6,868 at Swangard Stadium, gave Canada a 2-0-1 record and 5 points in the group representing North and Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico (2-1-0) has 4 points and will play Canada next Sunday in Mexico City. Mexico defeated El Salvador, 3-1, yesterday before a capacity crowd of 120,000 in Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.

Huge boulders act like mounds of Styrofoam, being tilted and lowered on all-too-visible ropes.   But then, a moment later, the Met's production redeems itself, taking on another character. The giant castle gradually sinks until it seems to become part of an underwater world; rocks rise with the Rhinemaidens playfully grasping the magic Ring that has finally been tossed to them. As the music swirls, that rock too lowers, the lighting shifts slightly and in the rear Valhalla can be discerned, engulfed in flames. It is an intelligent and compact solution to Wagner's attempts to show all three regions of his universe in the score's final pages.  The performance of the Met's first \"Ring\" cycle this season, which ended on Saturday afternoon after three previous Saturday matinees, seemed to combine that final scene's mixture of clunky artifice and supple grandeur throughout its 17 hours. Much of the grandeur was heard in James Levine's conducting, which could, at its best moments, be both subtle and sweeping, aware of the score's ambiguous shifts in expression as well as its more blunt invocation of motifs. But there was much else to take pleasure in as well, and there will be two other opportunities to do so: this Otto Schenk production of the \"Ring\" will begin again tonight with \"Das Rheingold,\" with all four works to be seen within the week, as Wagner originally wished; they will repeat again next week.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930419","headline":"With an Accent, All-Star Repertory Theater","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/19/arts/with-an-accent-all-star-repertory-theater.html","abstract":"  Often neglected, or at least not fully appreciated, is the role of television as the equivalent of an all-star repertory theater.

medical student, to your reporter in \"Future Doctors Unsettled by Health-Care Changes\" (front page, April 9) would be a stunner to any young person embarking on a career in the arts.    If Ms. Lumpkin feels as if she's in \"limbo\" because of uncertainty about which way medical care is heading, let her listen to any fledgling writer or visual artist talk about limbo in their field, which may stretch for a decade or more -- without any guarantee of critical or financial success.    A young artist's apprenticeship is generally unsupported and ignored; uncertainty in the arts is the name of the game.    Why should Ms. Lumpkin and her peers in science assume that, just because they are smart and determined, things will turn out the way they planned from the moment they knew they wanted to be doctors? It seems to me that uncertainty when you're still in school is far more salutary than knowing exactly what sort of desk and curtains will adorn your medical offices.

He recalls a bygone age of eccentric, flamboyant pianism, the heyday of legends like Hofmann and Horowitz. But his technique sometimes lags behind his chosen ideal. In the Chopin Second Concerto on Saturday night, certain passages were poorly articulated and ill focused; the interpretation unfolded more as a succession of startling moments than as a coherent whole. The Larghetto, however, left no doubt of Mr. Halim's gift for evocation and emotive intensity.   The central problem was the disparity between the pianist's sumptuous delivery and the somewhat meager resources of the New York Chamber Symphony, under the direction of Gerard Schwarz. Mr. Halim, perched at the edge of the stage, was under unforgiving scrutiny from the hall's close acoustics, and the orchestra did not provide full support. In the end, it's hard to deliver a firm judgment, although the pianist's approach certainly stands apart from the norm.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930420","headline":"Transactions","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/20/sports/transactions-658393.html","abstract":"  Baseball  National League   FLORIDA MARLINS -- Placed Bret Barberie, infielder, on the 15-day disabled list.

Also, Daly will probably reinsert guard Drazen Petrovic, who seems back to his normal brilliant-shooting self after a long layoff because of a torn ligament, into the starting rotation when the Nets (43-36) play the Knicks on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden.

Funny Gay Males, a slick, fast-talking comedy trio that opened a two-week engagement at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street, Chelsea) last Tuesday evening would like to think so. They have created an act that cautiously broaches gay themes with a snappy, wisecracking delivery smack dab in the mainstream of stand-up comic styles.   The members of the group -- Danny McWilliams, Bob Smith and Jaffe Cohen -- are more allies than collaborators. Although they appear together briefly at the beginning and end of their act, the bulk of the show consists of solo sets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19930420","time":"1993-04-20
