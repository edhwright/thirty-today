Heath Shuler was back at the helm for Washington, a team that has split the time at quarterback among Shuler, Gus Frerotte and John Friesz. Shuler, the rookie from the University of Tennessee, showed promise, but it was sandwiched around shakiness. His final statistics -- 11 of 28 for 165 yards and 1 interception -- were certainly nothing to rave about.

Refusing to recognize positive Iraqi moves discourages further cooperation and drives a wedge between America and other members of the U.N. Security Council.    Baghdad seriously damaged its credibility last month by staging menacing military maneuvers near Kuwait. After that ploy backfired, Iraq reversed course and recognized Kuwait's sovereignty and borders.

Giuliani and the City Council for primacy over the city's budget grew more heated yesterday as the Giuliani administration asserted that the Council's spending plan would leave the city budget $100 million out of balance.   Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said yesterday that cuts Council sought in the number of employees in the Mayor's finance office and in the sheriff's department would reduce revenue because of slower processing and collection of city taxes and fines for parking tickets.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941128","headline":"Britain's Civil Liberties Backslide","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/28/opinion/britain-s-civil-liberties-backslide.html","abstract":"  Britain, sometimes romanticized as the mother of some American liberties, is dismantling its own safeguards against compelled self-incrimination -- at a time when \"Miranda rights\" seem to enjoy new respect in the United States.

On the first half, Liszt's arrangement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony; on the second half, music by the Viennese-born American composer Robert Starer. The pianist's exuberance and confident attack on the keyboard tied his unusual program together.   Mr. Starer celebrates his 70th birthday this year. When the history books are written, he will probably land somewhere in the great open middle of American compositional tradition. His language is sometimes dissonant and even 12-tone in orientation, but it is fundamentally consonant beneath the surface, and his liking for open intervals puts him a shade close to Copland than, say, to Elliott Carter. Among other qualities, he has a certifiable gift for melody. Mr. Kolb gave the world premiere of his Sonata No. 3, an unpretentious but possibly overlong work in three movements. He also played numerous shorter pieces, among them the \"Sketches in Color\" familiar to many piano students.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941129","headline":"U.S.-Russian Space Mission Stumbles, With Delivery Delays at Customs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/29/world/us-russian-space-mission-stumbles-with-delivery-delays-at-customs.html","abstract":"  The first major step in an effort to get beyond the cold war in space has stumbled as the delivery of gear for an American-Russian mission early next year has been delayed by, among other things, problems at Russian customs.

He has signed onto the accord after extracting innocent side agreements from the White House. Mr. Dole, whose threats were harshly criticized on this page, deserves full credit for rising above politics to rescue an agreement fashioned over seven years of tortured negotiations. His leadership has made it likely, barring last-minute defections by Democrats, that the Senate will approve the agreement on Thursday after the House does so today. Countries around the world will quickly follow suit.   Though Mr. Dole's approval removed much of the drama, the importance of the votes should not be overlooked. The trade accord will deliver a shot of economic adrenaline that few other government policies can match. By some estimates, it will raise living standards in the U.S. by $1,000 or more per family.

His voice is a deep baritone, full of portentous Jim Morrison mannerisms, and his songs take up Satanism, death, sadomasochism and nearly everything else he could glean from old Black Sabbath records. \"I am a walking screaming hell/A thing of torture to behold\" he vowed as his band, Danzig, started its set on Monday night at a sold-out Roseland. Actually, he was a stocky, long-haired 35-year-old man with Elvis Presley sideburns, black jeans, cowboy boots and a rubber top that might have come from a wet suit, doing his best to glower as seriously as his songs required.   Mr. Danzig first made his reputation in the 1970's leading the Misfits, a punk band with a horror-movie fixation. Danzig is actually more old-fashioned; it draws on the blues-rock and heavy metal that punk-rock wanted to shake up. The four-man band -- with John Christ on guitar, Eerie Von on bass and Joey Castillo on drums -- is breathtakingly predictable. Every riff pounds its appointed number of times, every guitar solo delivers the appropriate squiggles.

The Serbs' war on Bosnia has exposed deep divisions among the Western powers over NATO's role and the question of European security. Some U.S. policy makers believe that the way to revive NATO is to enlarge it by offering membership and the military guarantees that membership confers to a few countries in Eastern Europe. Their rallying cry is \"Expand or die.\"   That is a questionable idea. If Washington continues to move in this direction, it is sure to generate more trans-Atlantic divisiveness. It will burden NATO's existing members with risky new obligations. Moreover, inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join will affront those who are likely to be left out, like Ukraine and the Baltic republics. Worse yet, expansion could strengthen Russian nationalists opposed to Boris Yeltsin and his Western-oriented reformers. The net result is that a larger NATO could diminish rather than strengthen European security.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"NEWS SUMMARY","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/nyregion/news-summary-965383.html","abstract":"  International A3-16  U.N.

In many ways, though, his uprooting from village to city is the story of modern Turkey.   When he and his family arrived here the other day, fleeing the civil war against Kurdish guerrillas in the southeast, they became part of a wave of migration to the cities that has shifted the nation's center of gravity from village to metropolis. And, propelled from Anatolia's far reaches by poverty and war, needs and dreams, this great column has come to represent another phenomenon, far more troubling to Turkey's authorities and their Western allies -- the grist of an Islamic movement that would challenge the secular core and Western leanings of the 71-year-old republic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"The Met Tries To Reinvent An Opera Classic","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/arts/the-met-tries-to-reinvent-an-opera-classic.html","abstract":"  It was, nearly, one of the most touching scenes in one of the most blindly passionate of operas. Cio-Cio San, abandoned and nearly penniless, knelt by a picture of her long-absent husband, urging her servant to faith with an elaborate fantasy of Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton's return. Catherine Malfitano made the aria \"Un bel di\" a wrenching revelation of Butterfly's delusion and desperation. And yet something was missing.   Suddenly, toward the end of the aria, a man slipped alongside Ms. Malfitano, shadowing the soprano's movements. In the final bars, he reached down and gripped Pinkerton's portrait with trembling hands. He stepped forward. \"Io con sicura fede l'aspetto,\" he sang. \"With unalterable faith, I wait for him.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941130","headline":"Signs To a Global Village In Progress","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/30/arts/art-review-signs-to-a-global-village-in-progress.html","abstract":"  The 22d Sao Paulo Bienal is a megashow that needs to make up its mind.
