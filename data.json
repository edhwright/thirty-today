The problem, in the section of his life covered in his latest monologue, \"Gray's Anatomy,\" is that these eyes no longer see in the same way.

At one moment, covering one eye and then the other, he sees alternative versions of the world outside him: \"Ecstasy. Despair,\" he chants as he shifts his hand. \"Ecstasy. Despair.\"   In a sense, of course, Spalding Gray has always viewed the universe through at least two seemingly autonomous levels of perception. Mr. Gray has described himself as a \"poetic journalist,\" and his particular skills as an observer have always hinged on a dialectic seesaw between satiric clarity and paranoiac murkiness. At one moment, he can create a portrait of, say, a doctor's office with searing journalistic detail.

He would complain publicly and frequently about being the prisoner of a single role and an unchanging formula, but the money and the power, which he wielded with aplomb, proved irresistible. He died at 76 in September, his last performing effort devoted to still another \"Perry Mason\" case, part of a series of periodic two-hour features carried on NBC since 1985.    Tonight's \"Perry Mason: The Case of the Killer Kiss\" involves, appropriately enough, a gaggle of soap-opera denizens, one of them murdered, the rest suspects. Created in a series of best-selling novels by Erle Stanley Gardner, the lawyer and author, the defense lawyer Perry Mason moved on to radio in 1943 where, for 12 years, five days a week, he was a character in a series that was part soap opera, part detective story. When that series was adapted in 1956 for television as the afternoon soap \"The Edge of Night,\" the characters were given new names. The name Perry Mason was reserved for the Raymond Burr weekly series that would run until 1966.    \"The Killer Kiss\" hews to basic cookie-cutter form. Several characters are brought together, in this instance working on a soap opera. One is always abrasive or worse, and he or she will wind up the murder victim. The police pounce on a prime suspect, who often turns out to have some acquaintance with Perry Mason (\"Her father was a judge,\" he will casually explain, \"her mother a law clerk\").    He takes the case, begins his investigation and, by the time of trial, everyone in the immediate vicinity is looking suspicious. His devoted secretary, Della Street, played from the beginning by Barbara Hale, can always be depended on for some motherly hovering. In increasing pain over the years from assorted ailments, the rather massive Mr. Burr is almost always sitting or leaning on some sturdy prop.    The trial unfolds with the inevitability of Greek drama. Viewers are assured of a tidy beginning, middle and end. The prosecuting attorney opens with overweening confidence but, inasmuch as Perry Mason has lost only one trial over all these years -- in 1963, and only because his client refused to enter evidence that would save her -- viewers are hardly in doubt about the outcome.    Even the judges, apparently awed by basso-voiced authority, are prone to give Perry Mason unusual courtroom leeway. And when the lawyer's investigative assistant rushes into the courtroom with the latest piece of uncovered evidence, it's only a matter of minutes before the true culprit blurts out something like: \"He was going to take it all. I couldn't let him do that.\" Tonight's final installment, starring a slew of real soap-opera actors, doesn't miss a well-worn trick.    Like Eugene O'Neill's father doomed to playing the Count of Monte Cristo for much of his professional career, Raymond Burr may well have felt suffocated by the role of Perry Mason. The problem is that Mr. Burr did it to perfection, even when on automatic pilot. For a while in the early 1970's, he did some wheelchair sleuthing as \"Ironside,\" but that was just riding on Perry Mason's coattails.    CBS tried to revive the \"Perry Mason\" series in 1973 with Monte Markham in the title role. No way. Mr. Burr had put a lock on the property. The actor and the role were bonded forever. It's one way, and certainly not the worst, to live the always precarious life of a performer.

So secretive are their sale and deployment that nobody really knows where or how many mines remain in the ground.

He's sensitive, but with a smirk. He's literate without being intellectual. And he's emotional without being messy about it. Mr. Dando, a 26-year-old hunk, is perfect for his huge audience of teen-age girls, and for much of his show on Saturday night at Roseland his audience sang along with his songs, producing a high-pitched sound that was mostly drowned out by the band's grinding sound. He's everything a teen-ager would want to be: smart, good-looking, successful, and still wearing T-shirts and ratty jeans.   One of rock's main tensions has always between melody and sound, between the contours of a song and the exuberant annihilation of blasting, distorted guitars. Mr. Dando is an extraordinary melodist with a flair for a 60's pop sound, and his best songs have the sort of logic all great melodies share: they seem so obvious, and it's hard not to wonder why they hadn't been written before. On his records, Mr. Dando emphasizes his pop side, all within an alternative, post-punk framework that's not always convincing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931129","headline":"New York May Need To Expand Boundaries","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/29/nyregion/metro-matters-new-york-may-need-to-expand-boundaries.html","abstract":"  \"NO man is an island,\" the politically incorrect John Donne wrote.

The orchestra's goal is to expand its repertory and, not incidentally, to tap New York's large Hispanic audience.   The first festival, from Jan. 29 through Feb. 6, is to focus on Mexican composers. The chamber music performances be at Weill Recital Hall, the Americas Society on Park Avenue at 68th Street and at Hostos Community College on the Grand Concourse at 149th Street in the South Bronx. The orchestral program, which closes the festival, will be at Carnegie Hall as part of the orchestra's regular series there.

Not only would the virus spread rapidly through sexual contact but it would also contaminate the nation's blood supply. Many homosexual men had been giving blood in an effort to help find a vaccine against another disease, hepatitis B, that seemed to attack homosexuals.

Kennedy's assassination has come and gone, and with it the endless retrospectives, magazine and newspaper articles and television specials, it's worth asking: how did the several dozen J. F.

The answer is that some did better than others and many seemed to cancel each other out, as is often the case when so many similar books emerge at once. It will take months before final figures are in, of course. But so far, in a field that runs the gamut from coffee-table picture books to meticulously researched biographies to outre accounts of new conspiracy theories, the most successful has been Gerald Posner's \"Case Closed\" (Random House), which takes the radically unradical view that there was no conspiracy surrounding Kennedy's assassination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19931201","headline":"Critic's Notebook; A 'Nutcracker' Filmed From Balanchine's Angle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/01/movies/critic-s-notebook-a-nutcracker-filmed-from-balanchine-s-angle.html","abstract":"  Fans of the seven-headed Mouse King will be thrilled to see their favorite villain in yucky detail as he sallies forth in the film \"George Balanchine's 'The Nutcracker.' \" Like Tchaikovsky's two other ballets, \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Swan Lake,\" \"The Nutcracker\" incorporates a fable about the forces of light and darkness.
