In Virginia, the powerful National Rifle Association failed to kill Gov. Douglas Wilder's measure limiting handgun purchases to one a month. In New Jersey, similar bullying failed to block a ban on semiautomatic weapons. Now Connecticut, long a gun-loving state, weighs a comparable prohibition.    The drive to impose a ban on semiautomatic assault rifles in Connecticut has gained particular momentum this year as police who feel outgunned by street criminals add their voices to the clamor for gun control. If the gun lobby loses in the Connecticut Legislature, that would palpably improve chances for passage in Washington of Federal gun controls. Such are the larger stakes as Connecticut's 36 state senators vote this week on banning the sale of semiautomatic weapons. Gov. Lowell P.

How does toothpaste for sensitive teeth work?   A.  Teeth often become sensitive when the gum recedes because of age, disease or too-vigorous brushing, Dr. Conrad A. Naleway, a researcher at the American Dental Association, wrote in Pharmacy Times, a publication for pharmacists. The newly exposed dentin is more porous than the rest of the tooth surface and opens new pathways to the nerves inside the pulp.    The resulting sensitivity to things like hot and cold may go away by itself, but some over-the-counter treatments can help. How well they work is hard to measure, and how they might act is largely speculative, Dr. Naleway said.   Chris Martin, manager of public information for the dental association, said ingredients in toothpastes recognized by the association's Council on Dental Therapeutics as effective in diminishing discomfort included potassium nitrate, strontium chloride, sodium citrate and stannous fluoride.    One respected theory of how these agents work, as described by Dr. Naleway, is that the pain is caused by movement of fluid filling the tiny tubes in the dentin that open into the pulp chamber. The fluid might either stimulate the nerves near the dentin-pulp border or stimulate the bony cells of the tooth so that they somehow simulate receptors in the pulp. Under this theory, the pain might be stopped or lessened by some means like blocking the tubules, coagulating material in them, or blocking the nerve impulse.  Cyanide Poisoning    Q.  How does cyanide kill?   A.  Cyanide kills by asphyxiating the cells of the body, said Dr. Margaret F. Dietert, associate professor of biology at Wells College in Aurora, N.Y.   Cyanide competes with oxygen in the body's cells, she said. The enzyme responsible for using oxygen has more affinity for cyanide than it does for oxygen, so the presence of cyanide starves a cell for oxygen. Cells' respiratory pathways use the oxygen in a complex process to break down glucose to produce energy for vital cell maintenance, Dr. Dietert said.   The last step adds oxygen to hydrogen to make water. If the last step does not occur, high-energy molecules of a substance called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, are not made.   Cells use the energy from ATP to maintain their semipermeable membranes, which control their chemical balance. Without maintenance, cell membranes lose their integrity and the cell eventually dies. If enough cells in the body die, toxic symptoms or death will result.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19930518","headline":"Hail the Conquering Horse: Prairie Bayou Is a Star","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/18/sports/on-horse-racing-hail-the-conquering-horse-prairie-bayou-is-a-star.html","abstract":"  When he arrived at Belmont Park on Sunday to take up residence for the Belmont Stakes on June 5, he was the acknowledged star of his class, and nobody was making fun of his name or his pedigree.

Chabrier, a well-to-do esthete and Government functionary, quit his job for composing in 1880, three years after \"L'Etoile\" appeared at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Unsuccessful on the stage, sunk in debt and long afflicted by health problems, Chabrier died 14 years later.

The Vietnam War continues to haunt and guide American military thinking, from Somalia to Bosnia. When puzzled by conflicting policies about whether to intervene in warring corners of the world, it sometimes makes sense to turn to fiction for another perspective.

Some do well, some not; very few go on to pursue solo careers.   Over the past week I attended a broad sampling of debuts: four pianists, two cellists, a clarinetist and a violinist. There were, as usual, a few bright moments and surprises. Benjamin Breen, a young violinist from Australia, played sonatas of Prokofiev and Brahms with a passionate if not always accurate tone; William Hagenah, a proficient young clarinetist, fashioned his own intriguing cadenza to Rossini's \"Introduction, Theme and Variations\"; and Sevgi Topyan displayed cool expertise in the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 2.

Most of its concerts offer a couple of recent works (one short, one full length) and some oldies (one from the 1960's or 70's, and one composed from the 1920's to the 40's). The pieces do not always sit easily beside each other, but there is something for everyone.   It was a fairly motley program that Paul Lustig Dunkel conducted on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall. The curtain raiser was \"Snake Alley\" (1989), by David Dzubay, a composer in his late 20's. Like many young composers, Mr. Dzubay writes in an eclectic style, which is essentially tonal, but which raids atonal techniques when they suit the work's thrust. In a way, this is a comic-book piece, painted mostly in bright primary colors and describing an exotic and sometimes scary journey through an alley in Taipei. There are moments when Mr. Dzubay's techniques seem simplistic and manipulative, but so what? For the most part, this is a vital piece that holds one's interest.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930519","headline":"2D TRIAL ALLOWED IN SKINHEAD CASE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/19/us/2d-trial-allowed-in-skinhead-case.html","abstract":"  An 18-year-old skinhead whose probation in the murder of a black man ignited racial protests may be tried on conspiracy charges, a state district judge ruled Monday.

There's always the same sort of publicity flurry, based on the musician's abilities in the jazz and Afro-Cuban idioms and the political and personal bravery it often took to escape. Usually their careers dwindle after a few years as the escape story loses its potency and as the musical limitations become clear.   The latest arrival is Gonzalo Rubalcaba, a 30-year-old Cuban pianist who has moved to the Dominican Republic with the blessings of the Cuban Government. Mr. Rubalcaba has been playing jazz festivals abroad for the last seven years and has had a remarkably fertile recording career, making Latin jazz, jazz and fusion albums for a variety of labels. It's easy to see why a record company might smell money around Mr. Rubalcaba. Not only is Afro-Cuban music blooming in popularity, but Mr. Rubalcaba is a classically trained virtuoso pianist. And even if he does have the blessing of the Cuban Government, he's still performing under a severe limitation: because of stipulations imposed by the United States Government he can't accept a penny of his earnings.

Here are a handful of his worst days on the job.  April 19, 1992    Torborg, less than a month into his tenure with the Mets, confesses to having underestimated the difficulty of managing in the National League. \"Our pitcher always seems to be coming up,\" Torborg said after a tactically suspect loss against the Expos 24 hours earlier. June 26, 1992   In a painful version of his daily radio show, Torborg is grilled about the coverup for Bobby Bonilla's phone call from the dugout the day before. The manager winds up apologizing to \"all the New York media\" for any lack of candor, real or perceived. Aug. 4, 1992    The Mets, only four games back of the Pirates and lacking their top players, respond to the manager's call for a \"critical win\" in Pittsburgh by losing in 12 innings. The Mets, who would wind up 4-14 on the season against the Pirates, go on to complete the decisive road trip 0-6 to fall hopelessly out of the race. Sep. 1, 1992    Torborg gets involved in a profane and physical confrontation with outfielder Vince Coleman on the field after Coleman was ejected for arguing a strike call. The scene dramatized what had been a season-long frustration for many Mets, namely that Torborg's failure to argue with umpires began to seem like a failure to stand up for his players. April 11, 1993    Torborg chooses not to discipline or criticize Bobby Bonilla after the outfielder's run-in with a reporter in the clubhouse at Shea Stadium. The Mets then go out and lose their third straight home game to the Astros.  April 25, 1993    The Mets squander a comeback from an 8-3 deficit and lose 9-8 to the Padres on an unearned run. April 26, 1993   Torborg opts to hide the cause of Dwight Gooden's shoulder injury after a clubhouse mishap shortly before Gooden is scheduled to start. It is later revealed that Vince Coleman inadvertently struck Gooden with a golf club while practicing his swing an hour before game time. April 29, 1993    Bret Saberhagen, who won't win a game against a non-expansion club before Torborg is fired, is bombed for three home runs in a 10-5 defeat to the Giants. The Mets commit five errors.  May 2, 1993    A second straight defeat in San Diego underscores another of the club's weaknesses: the bullpen is 0-10  May 8, 1993   Torborg, who said upon his hiring that all players would do all things his way, sees Bobby Bonilla fail to run full out from first base on an eighth-inning flyball by Howard Johnson, even though the Mets are trailing the Marlins by two runs. Torborg does not challenge Bonilla himself and ultimately has to act as a peacemaker after Bonilla flys into a rage at third base coach Mike Cubbage, who criticizes Bonilla's lack of effort on the field. Bonilla is neither fined nor reprimanded. May 9, 1993    After enduring the ignominy of having to identify a May series against the Marlins as critical, the Mets lose their second straight to the expansion club, securing occupancy of last place in the N.L. East. May 14, 1993    The Mets get a season-high 14 hits but lose to the Expos, 8-7. Frank Tanana gives up five runs on one hit in the first inning as errors and hit batsmen doom the Mets. The one-run loss is the first of three that weekend against the Expos. The Mets wind up 2-10 in one-run decisions under Torborg. May 17, 1993    \"Jeff Must Go\" is heard at Shea as the Pirates beat up Dwight Gooden and the bullpen in a 9-4 loss to the Pirates.   May 18, 1993    This time the Mets get 17 hits, but the ultimate result is a fifth straight loss, a 10-8 embarrassment to the Pirates that leaves New York at 12-25, the second worst record in baseball.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19930520","headline":"Five for Campaign Reform?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/20/opinion/five-for-campaign-reform.html","abstract":"  There are moments when elected lawmakers must decide whether to break with their party's leadership or toe the party line on an issue of fundamental public importance.

The 80 delegates who attended the session met in a mood of growing confidence that the United States and other Western governments will eventually accept the results of the referendum.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19930520","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/20/nyregion/c-corrections-657993.html","abstract":"  An article yesterday about Congressional opposition to President Clinton's tax proposals, and a caption with the article, named the chief White House lobbyist incorrectly.

Les Grands Ballets Canadiens made the distinction, no holds barred, with the stunning performance that opened its season on Tuesday night with three United States premieres.   The accent was mainly on sweep, not steps, at City Center (131 West 55th Street, Manhattan) although Mark Morris's new \"Paukenschlag\" is something of an exception on this first of two mixed bills. And certainly, the first is not to be missed. This company from Montreal plunges daringly into the earthiness of \"Na Floresta,\" a 1990 ballet by the Spanish choreographer Nacho Duato. But it is James Kudelka's 1991 work to Prokofiev, \"Desir,\" a bold meditation on how both emotions and bodies can take flight, that is the real heart-stopper.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930520","headline":"Critic's Notebook; Teaching Young Virtuosos How to Play Rough","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/20/arts/critic-s-notebook-teaching-young-virtuosos-how-to-play-rough.html","abstract":"  Scripture promises a Messiah who will make \"the crooked straight and the rough places plain.\" The first few days of the two-week-long Isaac Stern Chamber Music Workshop at Carnegie Hall have worked hard to reverse that process. Attending these more or less private sessions (three days of public master classes begin on Tuesday) are selected young quartets, trios and duos from as close as the Juilliard School and as far away as France and Austria. They have arrived revving their powerful, well-tuned motors and been quickly made aware that musical performance has indeed a starting point and a destination, but that its beauty lies in the curves, the bumps and the scenery speeding past along the way.   Shuttling back and forth between Weill Recital Hall and the Kaplan Space, this observer was struck by the identical messages issuing simultaneously two floors apart. Important among them was that phrases, though legs of a single journey, have lives of their own, their own logic, their own energy and their own peculiar punctuation.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930520","headline":"Brazil Minister Is Said to Quit","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/20/world/brazil-minister-is-said-to-quit.html","abstract":"  President Itamar Franco accepted Minister of the Economy Eliseu Resende's resignation Wednesday, Globo Television reported.
