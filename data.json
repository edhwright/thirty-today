So it's hardly Dee Dee Myers's fault that even some of Bill Clinton's loyal partisans use phrases like \"the last straw\" to characterize the President's shotgun marriage to the Haiti strongmen formerly known as thugs. The televised images of the thugs' thugs wielding crowbars in Port-au-Prince may overpower any words emanating from the White House for some time to come.   Just the same, who can doubt that Mr. Clinton has the worst public relations of anyone in politics, Dan Quayle included? The President has done more than a few things right, but such is his low estate that even the foolproof tonic of a growing economy won't lift his poll numbers. When Mr. Clinton isn't busy being his own worst enemy, sending forth mixed messages about Haiti or his numerical definition of universal health care, his inept messengers work overtime seeing to it that the good news is garbled as well.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940929","headline":"Advice for America : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/opinion/IHT-advice-for-america-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"The recently concluded population conference in Cairo seems to have come up with useful guidelines for family planning policies, namely that women should be involved in the decision-making process at all levels, that there must be broad dissemination of","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940929","headline":"2 Ex-Marines Refight War In Struggle For Senate","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/us/the-1994-campaign-virginia-2-ex-marines-refight-war-in-struggle-for-senate.html","abstract":"  After months of unemotional campaigning, Senator Charles S.

This is a craven and destructive bow to the demands of textile firms in his home state of South Carolina, who fear competition from abroad under the accord. If Mr. Hollings is successful, as he well might be, he would thereby delay and possibly block for good approval of a bill that would add $200 billion a year to the U.S. economy.   Mr. Hollings is the main culprit, but the White House was his enabler. It dallied in getting the legislation to Congress. Then it rejected advice to sidestep Mr. Hollings's committee. The danger is that the Senate vote could be delayed until next year, or longer.

But as the panic mounts in India and other countries, it is reassuring to recall that this disease, for all its historic savagery, should be controllable in the modern world. There are potent antibiotics to treat the victims, sanitation measures to reduce rat populations that harbor the lethal bacteria, and pesticides to kill both the rats and the fleas that spread the disease. The fight may be difficult in India, where millions of impoverished citizens live jammed together in slums with poor sanitation and rudimentary health care.

Sometimes he came to the brink of punk-rock, with the band pounding away at Iggy Pop's \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\"; at others, the violin and cello played stately, elegiac lines. In between, Mr. Escovedo was a storytelling songwriter upholding the verities of roots-rock: staunch guitar lines, terse lyrics and a sense of muscular sincerity.   Mr. Escovedo has been performing since the mid-1970's, playing punk-rock in the Nuns, country-rock in Rank and File, hard-rock in the True Believers and, in the 1990's, his own music. Many of his newer songs start quietly, kick into bluesy rock, then ease back into rumination.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940929","headline":"What Success Story?","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/29/opinion/what-success-story.html","abstract":"In drawing attention to the need for better family planning and reproductive programs worldwide, the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo this month was proclaimed a great victory for women.

Bangladesh's fertility rate has declined from seven births per woman in 1975 to fewer than five today -- a considerable achievement in a country that is the world's most densely populated and getting more crowded.

Granted it's gratifying to see an 83-year-old woman achieve art-star status and become as ubiquitous on the international scene as male artists (mostly European) slightly more than half her age. Over the last 12 years, Ms. Bourgeois has been featured and feted from Venice, where she represented the United States in the 1993 Biennale, to New York and beyond. (The Venice exhibition came to the Brooklyn Museum and is now at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.)    But overexposure usually comes with unquestioning admiration, and the art-world-doyenne slot into which older women can fall -- Georgia O'Keeffe and Louise Nevelson being earlier occupants -- encourages a particular lack of skepticism. The weaknesses of Ms. Bourgeois's work are rarely discussed, and only reverence seems to greet her rather skillful, self-mythologizing intertwining of her art and life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940930","headline":"RESULTS PLUS","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/30/sports/results-plus-393320.html","abstract":"  COLLEGE FOOTBALL  Auburn Extends Winning Streak     Auburn made a successful return to national television, extending the nation's longest Division I-A winning streak to 16 games with a 41-14 victory over struggling Kentucky last night.

The attraction was not the gala opening of the Carnegie Hall season, nor was it the presence of Sir Neville Marriner conducting the Academy of St.-Martin-in-the-Fields. Despite the orchestra's 1,000 or so recordings and widely respected achievements, the focus of attention was on Cecilia Bartoli, who is arguably the only classically trained singer under the age of 45 who is a box-office and recording star.   Toward the concert's end, one heard why. In a selection from Bellini's \"Sonnambula,\" Ms. Bartoli's voice became an expression of pure delight: sensuous, exuberant and overflowing. Amina's rapturous series of declarations, extending from \"Care compagne, e voi, teneri amici\" to \"Sovra il sen la man mi posa,\" is a celebration of unqualified, innocent love. Ms. Bartoli gave it precisely that character. The florid ornaments were never matters of display; they never proclaimed: \"Look what my voice can do. Don't you like it?\" Instead, the turns and roulades seemed to be emotion transmuted into sound, eruptions of feeling that could not be constrained by a simple melodic line.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940930","headline":"Eastern Europe, Post Communism: Five Years Later -- A special report; East Europe's Hard Path to New Day","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/30/world/eastern-europe-post-communism-five-years-later-special-report-east-europe-s-hard.html","abstract":"  The sleek new international air terminal here is filled each day with tourists and business investors flashing passports at border guards who sit behind high-tech glass booths, watching as the travelers breeze past customs with a wave.

I do not write as an inveterate Zeffirelli detractor; his \"Tosca\" is one of the Met's handsomest, most effective productions, and even the chaotic \"Turandot\" has a few points in its favor.

The distinction most are making is between a clean vote count on election day (which took place) and a free and fair electoral process (which did not). The process was not fair because the playing field was slanted in favor of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico uninterrupted for more than 65 years.   Pre-election reports by Civic Alliance, Mexico's most important monitoring group, and by the Carter Center's Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government, described widespread use of state resources to promote PRI candidates, large resource disparities between the PRI and other parties, and bias favoring the PRI in television coverage.

officers being led away in handcuffs have become a distressingly common sight in New York this year. This week, 14 more cops from Harlem's scandal-ridden 30th Precinct were arrested on corruption charges, bringing the total number of arrests there to 29. Two sergeants were taken in as well, suggesting that active complicity in corruption runs higher than the cop on the  beat. The shameful behavior in Harlem's \"Dirty 30\" precinct underscores the need for a permanent independent anti-corruption agency to help stamp out police crime before it becomes so widespread.         The rogue cops in the 30th called themselves \"Nannery's Raiders,\" after their supervising officer, Sgt. Kevin P. Nannery. The band is charged with faking police radio and 911 emergency calls to cover up illegal raids on drug dealers'  apartments, during which they seized drugs and stole large amounts of cash. The  Mollen Commission noted that supervising officers often looked the other way while street cops ran wild. But Sergeant Nannery allegedly went further and became an enthusiastic participant. In one case, investigators say, the sergeant and two of his \"raiders\" stopped a man in an apartment building, took his keys and then ransacked his apartment. They found several thousand dollars' worth of  drugs and cash, took the money and then let the dealer go. The officers also perjured themselves in many court cases, a development that could eventually lead to the dismissal of as many as 50 cases.
