Thursday's Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall began, however, with Mozart at a distance. The Mendelssohn String Quartet -- more elegant and not nearly as driven with its new violinist, Nick Eanet -- was pretty much smothered by the big space in which it played. An example: the finale of Mozart's D-Major Quartet (K.499), which with some straining of the ears became playing of admirable high-speed precision but which reached normally attentive listeners as a kind of blur.   Felix Mendelssohn's E-Flat Octet enjoyed, by sheer size alone, a more competitive muscle. It was also supported by a robust and joyful performance, one that mixed the best elements of shared gesture and individual free enterprise. Questions along this line -- the ones that ask whether chamber-music playing should be uniform or argumentative, a unanimous chorus or a colloquy between differing personalities -- were more fully explored in the Mozart G-minor Piano Quartet occupying the middle of this program.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930710","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/nyregion/c-corrections-906093.html","abstract":"  A report by The Associated Press in the Company News column of Business Day on July 2, about E.

In trying to stop the spread of nuclear arms, the U.S. has tried hard to keep such plutonium and uranium out of the hands of would-be bomb-makers. That becomes harder to do as more and more nuclear material is produced. The obvious answer is to ban the production of any more weapons-grade uranium or plutonium and deplete the world's existing stocks.    Until recently the U.S. and its allies have hesitated to take such a step, believing that they might run out of uranium to fuel their nuclear power plants and would need to rely on plutonium.

As one approaches his native land, Goldoni's stature becomes downright majestic. Nearly every Italian city, and especially his native Venice, is festooned with Goldoni statues, piazzas and boulevards. And in this, the 200th anniversary year of his death, stages all over Europe have been crowded with Goldoni's works.   Despite Venice's claims to primacy, no Italian city has been a more active champion of the playwright and his works than Milan. The reason is simple: Milan is where Giorgio Strehler, far and way the most important Italian theater director of the last half-century, began the modern-day tradition of Goldoni performance in 1947 with his production of \"Arlecchino, or, the Servant With Two Masters.\" The city is the site of Mr. Strehler's Piccolo Teatro, where three major Strehler Goldoni productions for this anniversary year, including a new \"Arlecchino,\" have been presented.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19930710","headline":"New York Restores the Catskills Into a Synthetic Wilderness","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/opinion/l-new-york-restores-the-catskills-into-a-synthetic-wilderness-450693.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   As author of the \"locally notorious article in The New Yorker\" that declared New York's Kaaterskill Falls \"all but unreachable behind a newly grown-up wilderness\" (news article, July 1), I'm writing to object to the adjective \"notorious.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930710","headline":"New York Restores the Catskills Into a Synthetic Wilderness; Grande Dame Hotels","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/opinion/l-new-york-restores-the-catskills-into-a-synthetic-wilderness-grande-dame-hotels-535993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   I played piano in the house band at the Laurel House in the Catskills the summer of 1964, just before New York State bought the grand old hotel and, in a sadly unimaginative mood, burned it down (news article, July 1).","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930710","headline":"High Bidder Reneges on Calculator","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/arts/high-bidder-reneges-on-calculator.html","abstract":"  The Swiss dealer who set an auction record at Chistie's in London in May with his bid of $11.8 million for a 19th-century German calculator now says he cannot pay for it.

Three clubs showed a hand that for most players would be a three-heart opening, and that bid was made in the replay.

Some journalists I know have divorced after covering a campaign, others have married and still others have quit the profession altogether. As for me, I turned to giant vegetables.   Last summer, during the dog days of the 1992 campaign, I traveled down to Arkansas to do a story on Bill Clinton and visited his by-now famous hometown of Hope. It was watermelon season, which is a big deal in Hope, a town that calls itself \"the Watermelon Capital of the World.\" Although melons didn't play much of a role in the President's early years, the drama of the season was hard to resist. So I made my way to the farm of Ivan Bright, who, aside from Mr. Clinton, has probably done more than anyone else from Hope to keep Hope alive. Mr. Bright's farm has produced two world-record winning watermelons -- a 200 pounder in 1979 and a 260 pounder in 1985.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930711","headline":"German Guerrillas Assert Leader Was 'Executed'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/world/german-guerrillas-assert-leader-was-executed.html","abstract":"  An urban guerrilla group has accused a member of an elite Government commando squad of killing one of its leaders in cold blood last week in eastern Germany, and the authorities say they fear reprisals.

In captioning, subtitles are transmitted along with the television signal for viewers unable to hear the audio portion of a broadcast. Until now, these subtitles could not be seen on regular television sets; a separate decoder costing from $130 to $180 was needed. But henceforth, decoders will be part of every set and can be activated at the touch of a button.

About 30 years later, Mr. Eastwood may not be so fast to yank off his shirt, but he has carried a trace of Rowdy -- tougher and more vulnerable than ever -- to his new film, \"In the Line of Fire.\" Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the film promised to be a blip in Mr. Eastwood's career.

Formed in 1976 by the singer and lyricist Mark E. Smith, it evolved into one of the most critically acclaimed and influential groups of the post-punk era. In the mid-80's, the Fall was the prototype for the abrasive British genre of \"shambling bands.\" More recently, its coruscating sound and cryptic lyrics have been a major influence on the \"indie\" scene in the United States. Pavement, the most prominent band in the burgeoning American lo-fi underground, is indebted to the Fall, as are other up-and-coming groups like Truman's Water, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 and God Is My Co-Pilot.   The Fall has signed with the hip independent label Matador, and the band's new album is its first for some while to be widely distributed in the United States. \"The Infotainment Scan\" (Matador/Atlantic 92263; all three formats), the Fall's 16th studio album, is one of the group's most accessible, so it may be that the band will reach a whole new audience, primed by Pavement, et al.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930711","headline":"Pursuing School Choice In a Political Minefield","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/nyregion/pursuing-school-choice-in-a-political-minefield.html","abstract":"  When school reopens in September, a class of gifted sixth-grade students from the Upper West Side will make their school choice by moving crosstown en masse to Robert F.

There are at least four faces to the city, roughly defined by the 90-day winter meeting of the State Legislature; the boat shows in spring and fall; the summer months, and the academic years of St. John's College, and, of course, the Naval Academy. (It is the academy schedule that the visitor should be concerned about: certain academy events require hotel reservations a year ahead). But the summer visitor has only to contend with other summer visitors, and a little planning will smooth the way to a rewarding sojourn, whether it is spent tramping the brick sidewalks to the unparalleled wealth of historic houses, attending one of the Bay-region bacchanalias, or chartering a boat for a sail on the Chesapeake.\n\nTo the uninitiated, Annapolis is deceptively self-explanatory. You arrive in the Historic District, which encompasses virtually the entire town and you park (this is never easy; take a lot of quarters, or consider shuttle buses from outlying hotels or the Navy Stadium).

In turn-of-the-century America, men personalized their mugs to reflect their place in the world. When you went in for your twice-weekly shave, your barber plucked your shaving mug off the shelf. You stepped up into the oak and leather barber chair, a throne for the middle class, and were pampered in a manner that would soon be nearly extinct. Today, shaving mugs are collectibles, selling for as much as $3,000 apiece. Barber chairs are cold chrome. The neighborhood barber is unlikely to have worked his way up from apprentice. In THE VANISHING AMERICAN BARBER SHOP: An Illustrated History of Tonsorial Art, 1860-1960 (Windmill Publishing Company, 2147 Windmill View Road, El Cajon, Calif. 92020, paper, $16.95), Ronald S. Barlow bemoans the loss and gives scavengers some hints about how to make money from the remnants. He pays tribute to a gentlemanly era of high-quality tools and pride in a job well done, but the book itself is a slapdash effort, too long in some places, too short in others. Mr. Barlow, the author of \"The Vanishing American Outhouse,\" includes a rapid history of the barber's profession, and the book is nicely illustrated, with vintage photographs and excerpts from barber-school manuals and barber-supply catalogues. \"The Vanishing American Barber Shop\" makes a persuasive case for barbering as an everyday art in its twilight.

The peeling white paint and rust-spotted roof of the house we had rented for two weeks on Lake Vanare, about five miles southwest of Lake George, only increased my optimism.  It was one of six Lakeview Fireplace Cottages, but unlike the other five -- one- and two-bedroom cabins with log siding -- this was the original lake house, a ramshackle white frame structure that made up in character what it lacked in paint. Because it \"needed some work,\" George Conable, the owner of Lakeview, rented the 1,600-square-foot cottage for $399 a week during our first stay and $415 when we returned last summer -- rates that were just a few dollars more than what he charged for cottages half its size. My husband, Daan, and I were delighted with the deal. When you have a 10-year-old who likes to practice his forward rolls and flips in the living room and a 4-year-old who prefers to be called the Weedwacker, you don't want anything too fancy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19930711","headline":"How to Undo a Century of Racism in Politics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/opinion/l-how-to-undo-a-century-of-racism-in-politics-023993.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   The Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of Congressional districts based on distribution of minorities in states has redrawn the battle lines of minority empowerment.   One approach to achieve equitable voting in minority communities has been to allow state legislatures to create county, state and Federal districts to represent large racial minorities. In the South and major cities, often an entire Congressional delegation of eight or nine would not include a single African-American, though African-Americans were 35 percent of the overall population. There was obviously something wrong with this system. The idea of creating the majority minority districts in these instances caused a furor and sparked resistance throughout the country. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 intended just that.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19930711","headline":"Russia's Nuclear Transition Ends Economic Security for Scientists","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/world/russia-s-nuclear-transition-ends-economic-security-for-scientists.html","abstract":"  The first to protest were scientists at two top-secret Russian nuclear weapons centers who called thousands of their colleagues into the streets to draw the Government's attention to their demands for a living wage.

Once the province of the monied and the socially connected, opera has in the last decade become much more democratic in both substance and style. Subjects that might once have sent operaphiles into fits of derision, like President Nixon's trip to China or the hijacking of a cruise ship, have quickly entered the culture. And because of opera's sweep and scope, it has attracted a wide range of artistry from various disciplines. Other artists can now flex new muscle, whether they are poets like Alice Goodman (\"Nixon in China\"), playwrights like William Hoffman (John Corigliano's \"Ghosts of Versailles\"), costume designers (Bob Mackie, Gianni Versace, Willa Kim), scenic designers (Tony Walton) or stage directors (Harold Prince, Frank Galati).   Paradoxically, in becoming more democratic, opera has also become more glamorous. Everyone -- artists and audiences alike -- wants in on the action. The glamour that was once the movies and the legitimate theater has found a new home. When the opera season begins in the fall, the life of glamour will itself be a plot subject, from \"Marilyn\" at the New York City Opera to \"The Dream of Valentino\" at the Washington Opera. A season later, the San Francisco Opera will make the stage and film hit \"Dangerous Liaisons\" sing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930711","headline":"NOTES","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/style/egos-ids-notes.html","abstract":"  Underwear, one of the most profitable divisions of Calvin Klein's empire, may be the subject of a new book by his wife, Kelly (above).   \"She is researching another book, but the topic has not been confirmed,\" said Lynn Tesoro, a spokeswoman for the Kleins. \"Underwear is under consideration.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19930711","headline":"BACKTALK;\nThe Making of a Wimbledon Champion: the Formative Years","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/sports/backtalk-the-making-of-a-wimbledon-champion-the-formative-years.html","abstract":"Ever since Pete Sampras was a little boy, his single goal in tennis has always been to win Wimbledon.\n\nAs I watched Pete play against Jim Courier in the final last Sunday, I thought back to a meaningless consolation match in Michigan when Pete was 13.

It Was the Pits  Rusty Wallace, with the aid of a quick pit stop, won the Slick 50 300, the inaugural Nascar Winston Cup race, yesterday at New Hampshire International Speedway yesterday in Loudon, N.H. The crew of the Penske Racing South team took advantage of the last of six caution flags in the 300-lap race as Wallace went into the pits second to Davey Allison and came out in front. The green flag came out for the final time three laps later, on Lap 274, and Wallace kept his Pontiac Grand Prix in front the rest of the way as pole-starter Mark Martin got past Allison to take the runner-up spot on the 1.058-mile oval. Most fans in the crowd of more than 60,000 were on their feet as Wallace, who has walked away from two crashes this season, took the checkered flag for his fifth victory of the year and the 26th of his career. (AP) Tracy Beats Fittipaldi and Mansell to Finish: Paul Tracy slipped past Nigel Mansell on the 15th lap and led the rest of the way for his second career Indy car victory, beating Penske teammate Emerson Fittipaldi and Mansell to the finish line of the Cleveland Grand Prix by about 30 seconds. Tracy had won the pole but lost the advantage to Mansell immediately, while several cars farther back in the field collided on the hairpin turn at the start. The collision ended the day for the local favorite, Bobby Rahal, and Roberto Guerrero, but no serious injuries were reported. After a five-lap caution flag was lifted, Tracy soon regained the lead from Mansell on that same hairpin turn and led for the rest of the 85-lap race on the 2.369-mile, 10-turn temporary road course at Burke Lakefront Airport, averaging 127.913 miles an hour.

Rai, the music of the disaffected urban landscape of Algeria, is a hybrid that has produced music of protest and beauty. Antique American fusion, which has become the secret hobby of third-world musical intellectuals, seems inevitably to poison everything it touches.   Mr. Boutella, who studied at the Berklee School in Boston, home of the internationalization of fusion, can write intricate lines that owe a debt to Arab classical music. The lines, played on keyboard and violin, zipped along, darting and turning, and always giving off the sound of passion.
