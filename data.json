Mr. Stenholm's bill would limit annual increases to an amount that would offset inflation and increases in the number of eligible recipients. That may seem reasonable, but it fails to account for many other reasons spending rises -- such as health-care prices that drive up the cost of Medicaid faster than inflation, or import surges that drive up the cost of agriculture subsidies.   A Congressional committee estimates that the Stenholm cap would require cutting entitlements by a whopping $150 billion over five years. Under the bill, Congress could close the gap by cutting entitlement programs or raising the cap. If it did neither, programs would be cut across the board.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940721","headline":"Kidd's Absence Angers Motta","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/sports/sports-people-basketball-kidd-s-absence-angers-motta.html","abstract":"  It didn't take long for JASON KIDD to anger Dallas Mavericks Coach DICK MOTTA.

Fernandez led, 6-0, 4-1, when Helen Kelesi withdrew because of a strained thigh. Davenport beat Patricia Hy, 6-2, 6-4, in the two-of-three-match team competition. Top-seeded Spain, Austria and Bulgaria also swept their singles. Today's quarterfinals pit the United States against Austria, Spain versus Japan, Germany against South Africa and France against Bulgaria. (AP) Upsets at Legg Mason: David Wheaton defeated the No. 7 seeded Ivan Lendl, 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (10-8), yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the $650,000 Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington. In two other upsets, Byron Black of Zimbabwe downed the No. 13 seed Henrik Holm of Sweden, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4, and No. 14 Jason Stoltenberg of Australia topped No. 3 Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 6-2, 6-2. No. 8 Aaron Krickstein rallied past Sweden's Mats Wilander, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). At night, No. 2 Stefan Edberg was to play No. 15 Jonathan Stark and No. 5 Andre Agassi was to face Bret Steven. Edberg's match, originally scheduled for the afternoon, started more than four hours late, the result of two rain delays. Rain stopped play for 75 minutes just after the the Krickstein-Wilander match, and again for more than two hours as the Wheaton-Lendl match ended. (AP) Injured Medvedev Loses: Marc Goellner, helped by an injury to Andrei Medvedev's serving hand, upset the Ukrainian, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, in the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Germany. But Goellner, ranked 78th in the world, had no time to celebrate winning his second-round match, which had been halted by darkness on Wednesday. Later yesterday, Lars Jonsson defeated him in the third round, 7-6 (13-11), 6-3. Top-seeded Michael Stich advanced to the quarterfinals with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Horst Skoff. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD  1-2 Finish for American Juniors  Two Americans, Sabrina Kelly and Aspen Burkett, raced to a 1-2 finish yesterday in the women's 100-meter final at the International Amateur Athletics Federation's world junior championships in Lisbon. Kelly won in 11.36 seconds, followed by Burkett in 11.40 and Ghana's Philomina Mensha in 11.43. Before the day's action in the meet for athletes 21 and younger, the United States track and field federation told the international federation that the apparent world junior 100-meter record set on May 20 by the American sprinter Tim Montgomery would not be submitted for ratification because the track was too short. The Americans said the time of 9.96 seconds was being withdrawn because the distance Montgomery ran on the Odessa, Tex., track was measured to be four centimeters less than the proper distance. Subject to I.A.A.F. ratification, the current world junior record will now stand at 10.08 seconds, run by Obadele Thompson of Barbados in El Paso on April 16.

In breaking the Open scoring record with a stunning round of 63, eight under par, Alfredsson finished two shots lower than any round ever shot by a woman in the Open.   The round by the 28-year-old Swede is a landmark achievement that transcends women's golf. No one, man or woman, has shot a lower round in any major championship. For magnitude, it approaches the record 63 shot by Johnny Miller at Oakmont in the final round of the 1973 United States Open, a breakthrough at the time. It also approaches the 63 shot by Greg Norman in the 1986 British Open at Turnberry and the 63 by Patty Sheehan in the 1984 L.P.G.A. Championship at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Center at King's Island, Ohio.

The decision to stay open was one of three choices before the Board of Trustees today; the others were to close outright or to reopen in the fall without a freshman class. In a unanimous decision, the trustees chose a very difficult path. It depends on reducing enrollment further, from last year's 1,000 to 600 this fall, cutting course offerings, reducing salaries of the faculty and reassigning teachers to administrative positions, and hoping that the state will come up with money to save the school.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940722","time":"1994-07-22

In the upside-down world of alternative rock, however, pretending to hate the business is the best way to get it to come to you. And Catherine certainly has all the ingredients that go into making a good alternative rock band. It may even have too many. It produced its five-song album \"Sleepy\" (TVT) with Billy Corgan, who leads Chicago's biggest current success story, the Smashing Pumpkins. It also shares a bottom-heavy rock esthetic with the Smashing Pumpkins; Mark Rew sings in a raspy, self-mocking growl reminiscent of Kurt Cobain. And as proved by the band's bad jokes on Wednesday, it has trouble communicating directly with its audience, in the manner of Mr. Corgan and Mr. Cobain.   Catherine played few songs with many parts. Songs usually began as slow, winsome rock ballads and after a screeching guitar solo, turned into heavy rockers and finally all-out noise made by three guitars squealing, scraping and clanging in unison. Catherine's music was as ambivalent as the band's relationship to success: it seduced and then repelled.
