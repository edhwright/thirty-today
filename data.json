The vote in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council was 8 to 1. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the dissent. FROM THE DECISION By Justice Stevens    The President has directed the Coast Guard to intercept vessels illegally transporting passengers from Haiti to the United States and to return those passengers to Haiti without first determining whether they may qualify as refugees. The question presented in this case is whether such forced repatriation, \"authorized to be undertaken only beyond the territorial sea of the United States,\" violates Sections 243(h)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (I.N.A. or Act). We hold that neither Sections 243(h) nor Article 33 of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees applies to action taken by the Coast Guard on the high seas.                    . . .         Aliens residing illegally in the United States are subject to deportation after a formal hearing. Aliens arriving at the border, or those who are temporarily paroled into the country, are subject to an exclusion hearing, the less formal process by which they, too, may eventually be removed from the United States. In either a deportation or exclusion proceeding the alien may seek asylum as a political refugee for whom removal to a particular country may threaten his life or freedom. Requests that the Attorney General grant asylum or withhold deportation to a particular country are typically, but not necessarily, advanced as parallel claims in either a deportation or an exclusion proceeding.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19930622","headline":"Kate Reid Memorial","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/arts/kate-reid-memorial.html","abstract":"  A memorial service for the actress Kate Reid is to be held next Tuesday at 11 A.M. at St. Clement's Church Theater, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton.

The Americans went ahead on goals by Chris Henderson in the 20th minute, Peter Vermes in the 36th minute and Dominic Kinnear in the 51st. But Jose Dolgetta scored in the 65th and 77th minutes and Miguel Echanaussi in the final minute. The United States, 2-8-10 this year, was playing for the first time in the America Cup, South America's biennial championship. The Americans, who are missing most of their good players, previously lost to Uruguay, 1-0, and Ecuador, 2-0, and had been the only team not to score in the tournament. The tie clinched advancement to the quarterfinals for Uruguay (1-0-1), which played Ecuador late last night. Venezuela (0-1-2) is unlikely to advance as one of the two-best third-place teams because of a minus-5 goal differential.

Dennis Conner, sailing his 60-foot yacht, Winston, crossed the finish line first in both races as an unofficial entry.

But although he is still youthful at 48 and has been famous since his 20's, when he was regarded as the young American conductor mostly likely to follow in Leonard Bernstein's footsteps, Mr. Thomas has never been tapped for any of the posts for which he was presumed to be a candidate. And although his prolific recording activities, television appearances and guest conducting have kept him in the public eye, he has not held an American directorship since 1979, when he ended an eight-year association with the Buffalo Philharmonic.    That changed on Tuesday, when the San Francisco Symphony announced Mr. Thomas's appointment as its music director, starting in September 1995. The orchestra had been searching for seven months to find a successor to Herbert Blomstedt, the Swedish conductor who will step down after the 1994-95 season. Mr. Blomstedt, who has done much to promote the orchestra's international reputation through tours and an extensive series of recordings, will become conductor laureate.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19930624","headline":"SENATORS TAKE UP CLINTON'S BUDGET WITH ACID DEBATE","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/us/senators-take-up-clinton-s-budget-with-acid-debate.html","abstract":"  The grand debate over President Clinton's package of tax increases and spending cuts opened at last in the Senate today, and Democrats and Republicans, well aware that the outcome is predetermined, seized the occasion to paint the economic differences between them in the starkest political terms.   The two sides suspended the invective long enough for the Republicans' alternative to the Democratic plan to be rejected. The Republican proposal would have capped spending on Federal benefit programs, frozen most other Federal spending and kept taxes at current levels. Republicans cast it as a tax-free way to reduce the Federal deficit; Democrats called it a sham because it simply decreed a halt to the explosive growth in benefits spending, without specifying how to halt it. A Turncoat in Each Camp    The vote against the Republican plan was 55 to 43.

Balanchine, despite such pitfalls, choreographed three versions of \"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\": in 1932, 1944 and 1979, on commission for the New York City Opera.

In doing so, it has given the executive branch a legal victory and a moral black eye.    Revolted by episodes of forced repatriation of political refugees, the United Nations and Congress prohibited the practice -- but not, says the Court, on the high seas.
