Unlike most cities, New York contracts the work to a private organization, the Legal Aid Society. Despite a history of dedication to an often thankless job, the society has grown fat with age. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has correctly chosen to pare the fat. That will cause the society financial pain. But it may also bring about new ways of dealing with the city's immense criminal caseloads and better justice at lower cost.    Two factors moved the society into the Mayor's line of fire. One was the city's budget crunch. The other was the society's foolish two-day strike in September. The strike, which Mr. Giuliani halted with a threat to fire the society, strengthened his hand just at budget time. Now he calls for a cheaper system -- $12.5 million less than the current budget of $79 million -- and a modern legal services contract to replace the one first signed in 1966.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"THE MOVIE GUIDE : Il Mostro","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/style/IHT-the-movie-guide-il-mostro.html","abstract":"Il Mostro.

The show, organized by the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Manitoba, brings together 14 Latin American artists, several of whom have shown in New York. They are an eclectic bunch, often thought-provoking, in one case genuinely exciting. But neither the specific works nor the essays in the show's vague, buzzword-filled catalogue suggests why they were deemed suitable company.   Given the lack of a unifying theme, one is left to judge the artists one by one, and generally speaking, the lighter their touch the better they look. It's refreshing to encounter a political metaphor as understated as Maria Fernanda Cardoso's \"Flag,\" a checkerboard pattern of guava candies forming an emblem both sweet and insubstantial, or to find gender issues as deftly explored as they are in the work of Jose Leonilson, whose crudely sewn dresses and wall hangings stitched with provocative inscriptions are \"women's work\" quietly in revolt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Jury Recommends Death Penalty for Abortion Foe Convicted in 2 Killings in Florida","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/us/jury-recommends-death-penalty-for-abortion-foe-convicted-2-killings-florida.html","abstract":"  A jury recommended today that Paul J.

His signature style is the clear-sighted film that serenely explores emotional and social upheavals, like \"Diary of a Country Priest,\" the 1950 tale of a quiet priest's religious crises. \"The Devil, Probably\" is a late, little-known Bresson film that takes the same calm approach to a world crumbling from the inside out. The film was shown at the 1977 New York Film Festival, then virtually disappeared from the United States until today, when it begins a weeklong run at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.    The film, set in contemporary Paris, begins with a newspaper account of a young man's suicide, then flashes back to the final six months of his life. Charles is 20 and in despair over a meaningless life. With his head hanging down, and his long hair parted in the center and hanging over his face like curtains, he seems a fragile, Christ-like creature. He has lost interest in the causes that consume his closest friends. One leads an environmental group; another hands out anti-clerical pamphlets in church. And when Charles finally sees a psychiatrist, the advice he gets is the most dangerous of all. Who controls such a world? \"The devil, probably,\" says a man on a bus engaged in a typical Bressonian philosophical argument.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Democrats Count on Little-Known Candidate for 'Insurance' in Senate Edge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/us/1994-campaign-minnesota-democrats-count-little-known-candidate-for-insurance.html","abstract":"  The Democrats desperately need an insurance policy for next Tuesday's midterm elections, and they think they may have found one in Ann Wynia, their little-known Senate candidate in Minnesota.

Even as polls of American Catholics show deep dissent from his positions -- a 1992 poll, for example, showed that 67 percent favor opening the priesthood to women -- John Paul II remains hugely popular. Why? Various explanations have been offered. He is charismatic, and a master of the world tour and the vast open-air Mass. In a culture of mendacious politicians and instant celebrities, he is appealingly countercultural: this world leader is no floating waffle.

Ulmann's subjects, among them the mountain people of Appalachia and the blacks of the Gullah region of South Carolina, were staples of socially concerned photography during the New Deal era, whether Margaret Bourke-White's sensationalist reportage for Life magazine or the more measured documentary work of Walker Evans and other photographers working for the Farm Security Administration.    But Ulmann's soft-focus portraits, presented in richly expressive prints made using the platinum process, are distinctly unlike the sharp, detailed images favored by her contemporaries. A diverse selection of Ulmann's powerful but rarely seen images, at the 292 Gallery in SoHo, is a pleasure to see for its own sake, and also valuable as a challenge to the widespread notion that only the sharp-focus approach of Modernism is appropriate for social analysis and critique.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"1919: Sober Assessment : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/opinion/IHT-1919-sober-assessment-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"PARIS - [The Herald says in an editorial:] Prohibition has had the paradoxical effect of serving, in a twofold way, as a stimulant.

Some of these excavations -- like the illuminating exhibition devoted to the Indian Space Painters held at Baruch College a few years ago -- add new information and broaden the sense of artistic participation. Others rehearse the progress of the artists most frequently associated with the period, reinforcing the notion that this sea change was the work of a handful of geniuses.    \"Barnett Newman: The Sublime Is Now,\" the beautiful exhibition of Newman's early work at the Pace Gallery, presents more than 50 drawings and small paintings dating from 1944 to 1949, and falls somewhere between the two types.

VIRGINIA -- Two new polls show that the race for Senate in Virginia is still unsettled in the final days and Senator Charles S. Robb may be gaining ground. Both suggest that the Democratic incumbent has overtaken his Republican challenger, Oliver L. North, but the leads are within the statistical margin of sampling error. The surveys were conducted by the Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research company and the Virginia Commonwealth University. Scott Keeter, a director of the Virginia Commonwealth poll, said that the most notable difference in the last two polls was a decline in the percentage of voters who said they trust Mr. North to tell the truth -- from 37 percent last month to 26 percent this time. One explanation, Dr. Keeter said, could be Nancy Reagan's comment last week that Mr. North \"lied to my husband and lied about him.\" MICHIGAN -- Detroit's largest black-owned newspaper, The Michigan Chronicle, has sent shock waves through state political circles by endorsing Gov. John Engler, a conservative Republican, for re-election on its front page. While polls have shown Mr. Engler far ahead of his challenger, former Representative Howard Wolpe, the Governor has been even less popular than most Republicans among black voters. Indeed, he received only 13 percent of the vote in Detroit in 1990. The Chronicle, which has historically endorsed Democratic candidates, described Governor Engler as having shown a lack of \"compassion\" toward blacks, but said Mr. Wolpe had failed to describe how he would improve Michigan's economy.

Tommy, who lives with his widowed mother (Patti Allison) and dour brother (Neal Jones) in a working-class neighborhood, is the highly symbolic main character in Kenneth Branagh's socially pointed melodrama \"Public Enemy,\" which is having its American premiere at the Irish Arts Center.   The play, which predates the films directed by Mr. Branagh, takes place in the mid-1980's, when the strife in Belfast was worse than it is today. One way Tommy has avoided being caught up in the warfare that divides the city is by spinning a fantasy of himself as a latter-day Cagney character. In the play's opening scene, he wins a talent contest in a bar by doing an impersonation of the Hollywood legend singing and dancing \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" But it quickly becomes clear that Tommy's identification with Cagney is more than a crowd-pleasing daydream. It is an obsession that has spun dangerously out of control.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941104","headline":"Article 726389 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/arts/article-726389-no-title.html","abstract":"  The history of Chinese food in New York is filled with as many embraces and betrayals as a prime-time soap opera.

More than 30 young men and women took part in the writing group, and for our final project I asked them to discuss issues that directly affect their lives. Here are some excerpts. Keep Positive I am 90 percent African-American. My desires and my goals are to be a choreographer, an actor, a singer, a writer, a model, an African-American activist. To keep myself motivated, I pick role models. I put inspiring themes on my bedroom wall. To be positive, you have to think positively. I am determined. I know times are going to be hard. I know I have strikes against me. I have come a long way. I want to take further steps.   Being a teen-ager and black in the world today is very hard. You never know what's going to happen. We live in a world of racism, hate, prejudice and other problems. Today for me and for others we need more racial pride and more racial identity. You Can't Win P eople think that because I take Ritalin my brain is messed up. Just because I handle things differently and my thoughts might be on another cloud from yours does not mean I'm messed up in the head. To me life is just a game you can't win. Why can't you win? The answer is clear to me: you are not supposed to win because the object is not to win. The object is just to play for fun.   I could never express myself very well through words -- that's why I turned to music to show other people how I feel. Other people never really get my ideas though.   When I look at the world today, I see hunger, pain, misery, drugs and crime. Making a Future People call me C-Dog. I have been to hell and back. I have been shot in the leg. I could have died. I have been to every school in Rochester. My mother and I have been through some tragic things. My father died when I was 11 months. My life was going downhill, but I'm in a comfortable school now, and I'm about to try and turn my life around. My mother works two jobs. I'm still alive. I want to go to college.   The real issues in the world today are crime, guns, us, our community. I know why people are killing each other. People are killing each other because they don't have a future. People live on the streets today, and no one cares about them.   Ever since I was in third grade I was a follower, but now that I have seen what is going on in the world I strongly believe I can be a leader. It's hard. I have to keep on pushing myself. I want to graduate and make my family proud, and most important I want to make myself proud.   -- Collice, 17 I Prefer Animals I am a very polite person. I like to practice different languages. My favorite music is jazz. I like pop and blues, too. I spend most of my time working at my house. I like to play basketball in my backyard or play football in the street. I am not a perfect person, but who is? I like animals better than humans. At times an animal is my best friend. My favorite subjects in school are science and social studies. I like everything that is natural.   Lately I have been thinking about the way drugs go around. I think people should go to church and put their money in church instead of drugs or cigarettes. Most people today are greedy, and that's why I do not care for money. Animals are not greedy. Animals are not wasteful.  -- Patrick, 15 One Dream I want to make it in the world. Maybe I can be an actor or a singer. I want to be somebody for my people. When I get older I want to do something that nobody can do but me. This is my one dream.   I have learned that if you want something in this world you have to take the initiative and work to the best of your ability. One other thing I have learned is that I am no different from a grain of sand on the beach.   Attitude I could care less about being on an honor roll. At this school before lunch we have 10 minutes of free reading. I have started a book. I have enjoyed reading the book. I am getting toward the end, and I don't like the thought of coming to the end of the book.   My favorite kind of music is heavy metal. My favorite group is Slayer. I think a lot of my attitude comes from the music I listen to. I'm not saying music gives me a bad attitude -- just sometimes music goes with the mood.   The most important thing in my life is my family. At this time in my life my family is having a lot of problems. My family puts a lot of pressure on me, and right now I'm trying not to let that bother me too much.   Childhood Walking through the outside air, the cold spring is all in my hair. It is dark. It is wet. It is gloomy. The ground is wet and soggy. It is like I am dark and secluded, not in a violent sense, in a sad sense. I like to sleep. Sometimes I wish I would never wake up. I want to sleep under water. My wish is to be blind and deaf so I could never see or hear the wrong doing.  Childhood brings memories. I lost my childhood the day I was born. I was always on my own. Maybe in some way I was happy as a child, not in the sense of anyone being nice, but in the sense of so much happened.   -- Jason, 16 Face It Drugs, crime, drugs are everywhere today. People fight and kill and hurt others for a buck. It is hard trying to make it in this lifetime. I don't believe drugs and crime will stop. Today we have to learn to live with murder, rape, robberies, fights. We have to learn to deal with them. We have to stop turning our heads the other way. We have to face the facts of life.  -- John, 19","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941105","headline":"Israelis Say Slain Arab Was Planning New Attack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/05/world/israelis-say-slain-arab-was-planning-new-attack.html","abstract":"  An Islamic militant leader who was killed by a car bomb in the Gaza Strip this week was himself planning a car-bomb attack inside Israel, the Israeli press reported today.

The concert was meant to feature some of the older musicians in jazz, and Doc Cheatham, the irrepressible and formidable 89-year-old trumpeter, opened the concert, aiming his trumpet at the ceiling as if he were thanking some higher power.

Surmounting inauspicious beginnings -- a host of singularly African plagues, from malaria to man-eating lions to tribal tensions and cost overruns -- the railway was begun in 1895 and completed in 1928. It became such an important conduit of goods and people that trains running twice daily between Kenya and Uganda were full with passengers, who included in the early years Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. Churchill called Uganda the \"Pearl of Africa,\" a sobriquet that stuck.   But in the early 1970's Idi Amin put his chokehold on Uganda, and the East African community, which had created common currency and markets among Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, rancorously disintegrated. By 1977 relations had so seriously deteriorated that the Nairobi-Kampala train trips came to a screeching, 17-year halt.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Travel"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Partying With Newt","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/opinion/partying-with-newt.html","abstract":"  The voters are angry.

On one of her crossings in 1944, the Mary, as she was affectionately known, was ferrying a full complement of United States Army Air Forces personnel, mostly pilots, to their duties in England. As she neared the end of her trip, sailing north through the Bay of Biscay in sparkling weather, lookouts aboard spotted a Nazi reconnaissance plane that in turn had seen and marked the ship as the incredibly valuable target she would be. In those days, the Mary sailed by herself; she was too fast to travel in convoy.

A millionaire businessman who co-founded one of the most successful computing services in the world, Automatic Data Processing. Born in Paterson, now lives in Cliffside Park. Has raised $7.4 million for this race.   GARABED (CHUCK) HAYTAIAN, 56, Republican. An electrical engineer first elected to the State Assembly in 1981; Speaker of the Assembly since 1992, which makes him the third most powerful elected official in New Jersey. Born in the Bronx, now lives in Independence, in rural Warren County. Has raised $4.4 million.                    --------------------         ANDREA LIPPI, independent   RICHARD J. PEZZULLO, Conservative Party   GEORGE PATRICK PREDHAM, independent   ARLENE GOLD, Natural Law Party   JOANNE KUNIANSKY, Socialist Workers Party   BEN GRINDLINGER, Libertarian Party   MICHAEL P. KELLY, independent THE ISSUES    Politically, the candidates are polar opposites -- Mr. Lautenberg's politics are liberal to moderate and Mr. Haytaian is a strict conservative. The centerpiece of Mr. Haytaian's campaign is a flat Federal income tax, and one of his campaign props is a slick brochure outlining 94 ways to cut waste and spending in Washington. Mr. Lautenberg says the tax plan is a fraud that would add $1 trillion to the national deficit over five years; he calls other Haytaian ideas unworkable or unoriginal.   Although both candidates have been in office a long time, each is trying to cast himself as the outsider and his rival as the career politician. At times, however, Mr. Lautenberg portrays himself as an inside outsider, saying that he would be able to do more for New Jersey as a third-term Senator than Mr. Haytaian would as a novice in Washington. ANALYSIS    Though polls throughout the campaign have shown Mr. Lautenberg with a comfortable lead, the New Jersey electorate is notorious for last-minute volatility and there is still a large bloc of undecided voters.   Mr. Lautenberg needs a good turnout from the traditionally Democratic urban areas. A year ago, Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, lost to Christine Todd Whitman by about 25,000 votes out of 2.5 million votes cast, largely because he did poorly and she did surprisingly well on that kind of turf. For Mr. Haytaian to win, he must rally his bedrock of conservative voters and the rest of the Republican faithful, but as importantly, he must match Mrs. Whitman's performance in urban areas, particularly among black voters.  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES    FRANK A. LOBIONDO, 48. Republican from Vineland, a State Assemblyman who works as the operations manager for his family's trucking business. A former member of the Cumberland County Board of Freeholders, first elected to the State Assembly in 1987.  Has earned a reputation as its most conservative member. Sponsored law making \"stalking\" a crime. Lost 1992 race for Congress against the Democratic incumbent, William J. Hughes.   LOUIS N. MAGAZZU, 37, Democrat from Vineland. A lawyer, currently the solicitor for the city of Vineland; has never held elected office. THE DISTRICT    Before 1974, the Second could be counted on to vote Republican. But Mr. Hughes rode to victory that year on the Watergate wave that swept dozens of Democrats into office. In spite of his party label, his conservative politics and his support of environmental protection, anti-crime legislation and senior-citizen issues helped him hold on to that office for 20 years before he decided earlier this year to retire. It is expected that with the popular Mr. Hughes now off the political scene, the district will return a Republican to office. THE ISSUES    Mr. LoBiondo has campaigned unwaveringly on conservative beliefs: lower taxes, spending cuts and reduction of the Federal Government. Mr. Magazzu has stressed fighting crime as the main theme of his campaign, including championing gun control laws. ANALYSIS    In land mass, southern New Jersey's sprawling Second District -- which encompasses all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, is the largest in the state. In politics, it is bedrock Republican and conservative. In 1992, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats 85,000 to 70,000 with about 150,000 unaffiliated voters. If Mr. LoBiondo loses, it will rank as a major Election Day upset. The Republican candidate has raised more money than his opponent by a 3-to-1 margin and polls show him with at least a 30-point lead.   The race has significance beyond even the impressive boundaries of the Second. Under the redistricting that reduced the New Jersey Congressional delegation to 13, Mr. Hughes's lock on the Second District gave Democrats a 7-to-6 majority. The majority will assuredly shift to the Republicans on Nov. 8. In practice, it will give the Republicans little more than political bragging rights, but it will be another blow to the political psyche of New Jersey's Democrats, who in the last four years have also lost control of both chambers of the Legislature and the Governor's mansion. EIGHTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES    HERB KLEIN, 64, a Democrat and a lawyer from Clifton. Served in the State Assembly for four years in the 1970's. Won Congressional seat two years ago in an expensive and bitter race. A prominent Democratic fund-raiser between his two stints in elected office, Mr. Klein spent more than $500,000 of his own money and $1.2 million overall in his victory two years ago.   BILL MARTINI, 47, a Republican and a lawyer from Clifton. Served on Clifton City Council and is a Passaic County Freeholder; also a former Assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey. THE DISTRICT    The Eighth was redesigned two years ago after New Jersey lost one of its 14 Congressional seats as a result of the 1990 Census. When Representative Robert A. Roe, a 12-term Democrat, saw the new district lines, he decided to retire. The district, once a haven for Democrats, is now highly competitive. It includes the blue-collar urban centers of Paterson and Passaic, as well as suburban towns like Glen Ridge, Cedar Grove and Verona. THE ISSUES    Both candidates say fear of crime is the chief concern of voters, with the economy, taxes and government spending also high on the list. Mr. Klein points to the recently enacted Federal crime bill as the first initiative coming out of Washington in years that offers real hope of increasing public safety. Mr. Martini calls the bill \"pork laden,\" with programs that have little to do with crime-fighting. He has said that only the certainty of prison sentences will reduce violent crime. Mr. Klein said he voted against the Clinton budget because it did not have enough spending cuts, and has consistently opposed tax increases that affect the middle class. Mr. Martini charges that his opponent later voted for all the spending proposals in the budget he opposed and that he repeatedly passed up opportunities to vote for further deficit reductions. ANALYSIS    Leaders in both parties agree that this is the closest Congressional race in the state this year. Both sides have spent heavily on campaign advertising and have been supported by visits from party luminaries from outside the state.

Uncommonly sensitive for someone in his trade, Tanner can be trusted to run a discreet background check on the woman his clients have chosen to carry their child, and you know that he'll bring an open mind to the politically murky ethics of artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization.   \"Kids are always kids, in my experience, and I imagine it's true even in the embryonic stage,\" Tanner smoothly reasons.

Today, a growing number of American educators believe that the world is too small, too competititve and too dangerous to tolerate the sort of ignorant chauvinism that so provoked James. The cure, they say, is not small, easy or cheap: American higher education needs to go global.    That does not mean lightheartedly dispatching students to sample cultural bonbons in exotic lands. To serious-minded American educators, globalization means such things as the presence of large numbers of foreign students and professors on campuses in the United States, so that this fall at New York University's Washington Square campus, for example, more than 30 different languages are being spoken.    It means tens, ultimately hundrends of thousands of American students resident in foreign countries, mastering the local language and culture and -- as with present-day University of California students -- taking a full load of rigorous, faculty-screened courses taught in the native tongue at one of 100 institutions in 32 different countries.    It means internationalizing the curriculum, as in a course in accounting at the University of Michigan School of Business that now includes the study of Japanese regulations permitting the depreciation of assets at many times the rate allowed in the United States.    It means using the latest technology so that sudents at Ramapo College, a small, publicly supported institution in Mahwah, N.J., join in discussions with other students, scholars, artists and officials around the world in 120 teleconferences every year.    \"International education is not a new idea, but the times have now conjoined to make it dominant,\" said L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who has taken a leading role in the movement.    \"What's happening here,\" he continued, \"is comparable to what happened in the 19th century when Johns Hopkins University adopted the philosophy of the great German research universities and set the pattern for Harvard, Yale and the others.\"    The number of American student studying abroad has grown steadily over the last five years and is now at a record high of 72,000, according to the Institute of International Education, the nation's leading educational exchange organization. This figure is small in comparison with the number of foreign students studying in the United States (438,000, or six times as many), but -- significantly -- the profile of these itinerant American students has changed.    \"Typically, they used to be affluent women in their junior year at one of the elite Seven Sisters colleges and they would be studying architecture and French language in Paris,\" said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute. \"But today more of them tend to be male, they are less likely to be affluent, they may be interested in business or industry and there's a slight shift away from Europe as their destination.\"    One conspicuous sign of the growth of international studies is the number of study-abroad programs now being offered. Ranging from a business and economics course at the university of Hungary in Pecs to another concentrating on language and culture at the leading university in Hanoi, Vietnam, these programs have virtually doubled over the last decade, from 1,857 to 3,701.    Students are eagerly responding. At an elite institution like Harvard University, 51 percent of the undergraduates participate in at least one work or study program abroad. At Kalamazoo College, a small, selective liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Mich., 85 percent of the students study overseas thanks to a private gift of more than $5 million that subsidizes travel and on-site living expenses.    A few American colleges and universities have not been satisfied with merely offering study-abroad programs but have adopted globalism as a fundamental objective for the entire institution. Speaking for N.Y.U., Mr. Oliva recently declared: \"We plan to enter the next century as the quintessential global university. We will extend to every undergraduate the opportunity to study abroad as part of his or her N.Y.U. education, and we will become a center for global faculty inquiry and a center for worldwide conferences of university leaders.\"    Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said his institution aspired to be \"a global college\" for more practical reasons. \"We believe,\" he said, \"that our graduates likely will either supervise or be supervised by someone of another race, ethnicity or nationality, and that their careers and lives as citizens will be affected by international and intercultural life.\"    Several American colleges and universities have established campuses in foreign countries so that students may spend extended periods abroad and earn credits readily accepted by employers and graduate schools in the United States. Webster University in St. Louis operates wholly owned branches in Geneva, London, Vienna and the Dutch city of Leiden.    Emerson College, a small liberal arts school in Boston, has established a branch in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where students study subjects such as global marketing, communications and advertising.    Some of these branches fare better than others; Japan, for example, has proved especially tricky for American institutions to penetrate. Of the more than 20 American branches established in Japan in recent years, at least 9 have failed, most recently a Texas A & M branch in Koriyama. All are said to have been victims of the economic recession in Japan and the unexpected difficulty of recruiting Japanese students.    But if it has not always been easy to attract foreign students to American compuses overseas, foreign students have for years flocked to attend colleges and universities in the United States. In fact, according to the Department of Commerce, the 438,000 foreign students currently resident in the United States, while only a small fraction of the total enrollment of 14.5 million, have fed a major and all-but-hidden export industry bringing some $6 billion annual to the American economy.    The cohort of foreign students has kept growing steadily at the rate of about 4.5 percent a year for the past two decades. Quite often, these students become leaders in their societies at home. Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said he recently attended a state reception in Seoul, South Korea, at which no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers introduced themselves to him as Berkeley graduates.    \"That's typical,\" Chancellor Tien remarked. \"I get the same greetings in Indonesia and Singapore.\"    The reasons for all of this activity are many. The first and most important is the rise of the global economy. Alert, job-oriented students have come to realize that as the world shrinks, many of the best jobs are going to go to college graduates who possess international skills. For example, after graduating from Wellesley College in 1987, Cynthia Jeffers taught English for two years in Japan under a program run by the Ministry of Education. She then returned to the United States, entered the Harvard Business School and upon her graduation last June landed a job as an associate in the corporate finance department of Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the major brokerage firms on Wall Street. Her experience in Japan, she said, greatly increased her prospects in the job market.   Another stimulus for globalization is that most financial aid for students has recently become \"portable,\" as college officials like to say. In the past, vaguely worded Federal statutes authorizing financial aid for college students -- Pell grants, Stafford loans and the like -- made many student advisers hesitant to recommend the use of these grants overseas.   Stephen Cooper, the director of academic programs abroad at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that he and a group of associates successfully lobbied Congress to make every form of Federal aid for students applicable for study overseas. The new explicit language appears in the Higher Education Act of 1992.   \"Judging from the number of inquiries I've received from around the country, this is having a big impact,\" said Professor Cooper.   Still another spur is the development and prevalence of new communications technology that allows educators to leap oceans and cross borders with impunity. B. Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School and a pioneer in the field educators now call \"distance learning,\" has taken the new technology a step further. Last year Dean White set up a program sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the national airline of Hong Kong, that employs interactive television to link M.B.A. candidates in Hong Kong with professors at Ann Arbor.   \"It's actually a complex teaching system because we don't believe we can provide the quality we want with interactive TV alone,\" said Dean White. \"Consequently, we send our faculty to Hong Kong and bring their students here for face-to-face meetings.\"   \"It's the future,\" he continued. \"Our pilot project for Cathay Pacific carries with it a vast productivity potential.\"   Another reason for the growth of interest in globalization is that travel abroad, like hit shows on Broadway, has good word of mouth. \"It's a cliche, but over and over you hear students saying 'It changed my life!' \" said Dr. Krasno.   It is a point confirmed by Corbin Smith, the director of Stanford University's Overseas Study Office. \"When we surveyed the senior class here over the last few years,\" Mr. Smith said, \"asking what was the most meaningful experience during their undergraduate years, more than 87 percent of those who participated in a Stanford study-abroad program gave that the highest rating.\"   Not everyone is so enthusiastic. Roger Kimball, the neoconservative author of \"Tenured Radicals,\" which takes a skeptical look at academia, observes that colleges are \"making out like bandits\" by collecting full tuition from students and \"placing them at a fraction of that cost at overseas institutions.\"   It is true that the ranks of foreign students in the United States have been swollen not only by the quality of colleges here but also by sharp-eyed admissions officials who have successfully recruited well-heeled foreign students when they were unable to fill their campuses with enough American students able to pay the ever-rising tuition costs.   In fact, unregulated overseas recruitment proved so easy -- and profitable -- that a few years ago unscrupulous hucksters began to recruit foreign students for small community colleges in the United States with misleading promises that after a year or two the student could transfer into Harvard or M.I.T. Today, some professional organizations have adopted generally effective guidelines and codes of ethics to substantially reduce such misrepresentations.   And some critics, like Mr. Kimball, say there is a great   Continued on Page 31  Continued from Page 26  deal of wishful thinking in the notion that \"a semester abroad is going to make one into an internationalist.\"   Holly M. Carter, dean of the office of educational opportunity programs at Northeastern University, argues that the belief that today's college students are more culturally aware than their predecessors is a comforting myth that ignores \"the increase in hate crimes, blatant bigotry and racism on the campuses.\"   But educational leaders like Mr. Oliva of N.Y.U. argue that a global perspective is vital to the international community. \"There are at least three factors driving the globalization of education today,\" he said. \"The first is purely serendipitous: We're on the cusp of a new wave of immigration.\" (About a million immigrants have come to New York over the past decade, many of whom have attended N.Y.U.)   \"Second,\" he continued, \"people realize that the more different environments you move into, the more you learn. Conversely, the more you study with people just like yourself, the less you learn.    \"I realize in my own life that I never learned more than when I was overseas for a year and a half. Everything became very vivid. There was no moment when I could let my mind relax. And gradually, I discovered that I could master change.\"   \"And third,\" Mr. Oliva said, \"the demise of the Soviet Union has made Americans more international than ever. It made us realize that the Soviet Union had been a major force in policing ethnic rivalries. The world got capped under big cloaks. We used to think of the division between Northern and Southern Ireland, and what's happening in Yemen, as anomalies. Now we see them as the rule.    \"In the future,\" he continued, \"we probably face 30 to 40 years of instability and border wars like the 19th century, but with one frightening difference -- small nations possessing immensely destructive weapons. So our job in international education is to help provide a global environment in which these ethnic disputes can be handled on the basis of intellectual discourse and debate, not war.\"   John Markham, director of the University of California's Education Abroad Program, says, \"The question I like to ask is: Should the University of California have a foreign policy?\"   Most educators acknowledge that the vast majority of American faculty and students are still relatively insular, but they are optimistic that economic forces will prevail.   \"The sea change will occur,\" Dr. Krasno said, \"when the global economy drives corporate leaders to say they want to hire people with foreign language skills and knowledge of foreign cultures, and that all things being equal they will hire them first. That's when the rush will begin.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Gerry H. Rubin, David L.

One of the most significant of these outbreaks was the appearance in the late 1940's and 1950's -- overnight, like so many mushrooms -- of countless small independent record companies based in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and other urban centers.    Fed and watered by the huge numbers of blacks who had swarmed to the cities for defense jobs during World War II, the indies, as they were called, pumped out dance music, hot blues and boogie-woogie records that the major labels usually just didn't bother with. These small companies were often started by music-industry amateurs -- small businessmen, nightclub owners and hustlers, some of whom actually had a genuine ear for music, all of whom had an eye for the main chance.  Spurred by an amalgam of opportunism, megalomania, true love for music and sheer greed, they managed to document some of the most vigorous popular music ever recorded in America.

And T.W.A. also deserves an aerial loop-the-loop. While the airline contested the designation of parts of Eero Saarinen's 1962 building, described by Robert A. M. Stern as the \"Grand Central of the jet age,\" it had good reason for doing so. In addition to sharing J.F.K.'s general state of dilapidation, the T.W.A. terminal is in dire need of design modifications. Airport security regulations and increased air traffic have placed demands on the building unforeseen 30 years ago. Happily, these changes will now be supervised by a preservation architect sensitive to Saarinen's design.   The Grand Central comparison is probably stretching it. While T.W.A. is a powerful piece of expressionistic sculpture, echoing Erich Mendelssohn's dynamic designs of the 1920's, it lacks Grand Central's urban prominence and complexity. Wallace K. Harrison's main terminal for La Guardia remains the most architecturally distinguished airport building in New York, not least because of the skill with which Harrison knitted the terminal into the context of urban transportation. With its raised roof canopy tilted toward the sky above the terminal's concave facade, the design deftly merges the highway's horizontal curve with an airplane's upward angle of takeoff.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Ghostly Spot, New Life . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-morrisania-ghostly-spot-new-life.html","abstract":"  When Pearl Fleming moved to Walton Avenue more than two decades ago, she would see the bustle around the Morrisania Hospital's emergency-room entrance and the students in the adjoining nursing school.

It has become a posthumous tribute to the American artist rather than a follow-up to the gallery's Dehner exhibition of 1993. The show opens today and will continue through Dec. 4.   Influenced heavily by the Fauves, Cubists and German Expressionists of the 1920's, Dehner drew and painted until the 1950's, when she began to sculpture as well. The show contains line drawings, watercolors, gouaches and bronzes, varying in scale and ranging in style from the figurative to the abstract.   During the 50's she divorced her husband, the sculptor David Smith, and began achieving a reputation for herself. The gallery director, Vincent Baldassano, said: \"Dehner is often analyzed in terms of her 25-year marriage to Smith, during which she nurtured him intellectually and artistically. His effect on her life and art, however, is variously described as competitive, intimidating and stifling.\"   The gallery, at 43 Katonah Avenue, is open Thursdays through Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. For more information, call 232-7529.

The sponsoring nonprofit groups are dedicated to promoting the use of fleece, cotton, wool, silk and flax in creative ways, and they encourage people to use natural fibers in weaving. Visitors who come dressed in their own fibre creations will receive gifts, and those who donate a knitted or woven cap to a drive called Caps for Kids will get a free raffle ticket.   Throughout the day there will be classes for beginners and experienced practitioners, children, teenagers and adults, in knitting, spinning, weaving, dyeing, crocheting, pattern charting and machine knitting. Yarn, fleece, flax, silk, buttons, books, videos and all kinds of knitting, spinning and weaving equipment will be on sale.   The college cafeteria will be open for lunch, and all events will be held in Rita Hall, including the raffle, a bake sale and a fiber fashion show.  Admission will be $5, $2 for children.

The only really appropriate response to these pictures is either to go down on your knees or to swoon, but since both are rather out of date, a little skeptical admiration will do.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Great Minds Think . . .","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/theater/l-uncle-vanya-great-minds-think-727261.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In her essay on the contemporary relevance of Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya\"  [ \"Why 'Vanya,' and Why Now?,\" Oct. 16 ] , Patricia Bosworth attributes to the critic Harold Clurman the quote \"Life is a tragedy for those who feel, a comedy for those who think.\" This quote is a particular favorite of mine and originated with Horace Walpole, who said: \"This world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel.\"  MILLICENT JENSEN  St. Simon's Island, Ga.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"McNally, True, but Vaguely Neo-Chekhovian","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/theater/sunday-view-mcnally-true-but-vaguely-neo-chekhovian.html","abstract":"  YOU MIGHT NOT THINK THAT Terrence McNally, the man who wrote \"The Ritz,\" one of the few authentic modern American farces and one with a decidedly gay sensibility, has much in common with Anton Chekhov, but then you haven't yet seen \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\" The new play, now at the Manhattan Theater Club, is a big, generous, haunted comedy that in its vaguely neo-Chekhovian way is both very funny and filled with intimations of time's passage, of loss and death.   \"But,\" you might say, \"Chekhov wasn't gay.\" To which Buzz Hauser (Nathan Lane), one of the eight homosexual characters in \"Love! Valour! Compassion!,\" would reply, \"Who says so?\" It's probable that Buzz, who's convinced that virtually everybody is gay and just doesn't admit it, could make a case for Chekhov. Yet it isn't homosexuality that links the new comedy to \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"The Seagull.\" Rather, it's Mr. McNally's breadth of vision and his ambitious attempt to deal with characters, who are both privileged and threatened, in a way that ignores self-pity but doesn't ignore the larger world outside. Though the audience never sees that other world, what's happening in it is very much a part of the life of the play itself.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"The Barnstorming of New York Candidates","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/the-barnstorming-of-new-york-candidates.html","abstract":"  From the Brooklyn waterfront to Brookhaven, L.I., to a rally in Rochester, the man who wants a fourth term as Governor and the men who would succeed him sped into the last weekend of an election campaign that will test the power of anti-incumbent anger and perhaps reshape New York politics.

In countries where graduates find they have trained for careers in fields already crowded with professionals, many schools are shifting their emphasis to job training and workplace skills. Some universities find themselves short of students; others have a surplus. As institutions of higher learning struggle to find solutions, they are questioning long-held traditions and beliefs about their systems of higher education.    If French students were long thought to spend their time sitting around drinking coffee, smoking Gitanes and discussing philosophy, that image vanished in clouds of tear gas this spring when tens of thousands of them took to the streets to insist on their right to a well-paid job after they completed their studies.    The spark for the violent protests was a new law allowing employers to pay less than the legal minimum wage to those with technical diplomas. Affected students were outraged. They said they had been led to higher education by the promise of good jobs, but now were being told that their studies were worthless.    The Government quickly backed off, saying it had merely tried to fight unemployment, which affects one in four French youths between the ages of 18 and 25. But the dispute helped focus on a more fundamental issue. What is the purpose of higher education in France today? Should youths be educated for the sake of being educated or should the emphasis be on preparing them for the workplace?    Traditionally, French universities had a somewhat elitist approach. But since 1984 everyone who passes the baccalaureat examination at the end of high school has the right to a place at a university. As a result, the number of students in higher education has jumped from 1.2 million in 1980 to 2 million this year.    Over this period, umemployment has continued to rise. And since by law university students can study what they like, they are rarely guided toward degrees with better job prospects. It is only when they complete their studies, then, that many discover they have not been prepared for the job market.    Officials in the Ministry of Higher Education conceded that they were under pressure from university rectors to limit the number of students and even to institute entry exams, and under pressure from the private sector to focus more on practical education. But they said all efforts to bring change are politically explosive, not only because higher education is now considered a right, but also because universities absorb youths who might otherwise be unemployed.    \"It's a critical situation,\" one ministry official said. \"The student needs to know if he's capable of doing a specific job, but the university doesn't answer that question. It's only posed when the graduate looks for a job and is told, 'You've done three years of law studies, but tens of thousands have done the same thing, so why should we choose you?' People are only now discovering that their blind faith in degrees is a fiction.\"    As a result, more students are now opting for two-year courses in so-called University Institutes of Technology because graduates from these schools are in greater demand than those from a conventional university. It is not surprising, then, that they fought the wage cut. Some experts believe students must change as much as universities. \"No one wants to stop studying before university,\" said Jean Barrans, a retired professor from Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse. \"Everyone wants a white-collar job and no longer accepts a blue-collar job.\" Professor Barrans also said that he felt French students had grown passive because only 20 percent work their way through the university. The rest are supported by their parents or government grants. \"If they had to work to finance their studies, as in the United States,\" he said, \"perhaps things would be better here.\" ALAN RIDING","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"BEST SELLERS: November 6, 1994","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/books/best-sellers-november-6-1994.html","abstract":"                   Weeks    This   Last   On    Week   Week   List   Fiction              1   1   3   INSOMNIA, by Stephen King.

To the design by Alexander Jackson Davis from the early 1830's, which was almost surely not followed exactly? To its appearance when completed in 1839 as the New York City Lunatic Asylum? To the time in 1878 when the low roof was replaced by a Victorian dome, designed by Joseph M. Dunn?   The Octagon is an eight-sided tower with a spectacular flying staircase that spirals around a 62-foot-high rotunda. It once served as the hub between the south and west wings of a much larger building. The wings were demolished in 1970. The dome was lost in a 1982 fire that also ravaged the interior.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Real Estate"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"For This Father, Daughter Knows Best","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/theater/theater-for-this-father-daughter-knows-best.html","abstract":"  IT IS JUST BEFORE A REHEARSAL for \"Night Seasons,\" Horton Foote's next play in the Signature Theater Company's season of his work, and Hallie Foote, his daughter, has some questions.   \"How long is it between Laura Lee's visit to Dolly and Mr. Weems's dying?\" Ms. Foote asks her father.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Journal; Double Trouble","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/opinion/journal-double-trouble.html","abstract":"  Those of us who live a safe distance from Virginia and California are probably having too much fun arguing the No. 1 election-eve question over dinner: Who would be scarier, Senator Oliver North or Senator Michael Huffington?

CURRY JR., 42, Democrat. State Comptroller since 1990, lawyer, State Senator from 1979-83, ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1982, former political director of Freeze Voter, the political arm of the nuclear-freeze movement.    EUNICE S. GROARK, 56, A Connecticut Party. A one-time Republican, Lieutenant Governor since 1990 when she ran on the third-party ticket of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker. Lawyer, corporation counsel for Hartford from 1987-90, and a Hartford City Councilwoman from 1981-85.   JOHN G. ROWLAND, 37, Republican. Congressman from Waterbury from 1985-91, barely lost the 1990 race for governor, member of House Armed Services Committee. Consultant since 1990 for several military contractors based in Connecticut.    TOM SCOTT, 36, radio talk-show host, State Senator from 1981-1991, led anti-income tax movement in 1991, ran unsuccessfully for United States House of Representatives in 1990 and 1992. THE ISSUES    The state income tax, imposed in 1991, has been the central issue. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott promise to scrap it without raising other taxes. Mrs. Groark would not change the income tax, and Mr. Curry wants to keep it and economize elsewhere to provide money to cities and towns to cut property taxes. All candidates have called for expanded efforts to reduce crime, and all four favor the death penalty. Mrs. Groark has been attacked over the Weicker administration's policy of giving tax breaks and cash incentives to attract and retain companies, an approach she favors. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott says tax cuts would do more for the economy than such incentives. Mr. Curry would shift economic assistance to smaller companies. ANALYSIS    Mr. Rowland has been the front-runner since the campaign began, and has had a large advantage in financing, spending much of his money on television commercials. But Mr. Scott, who appeals to many of the same conservatives, has drawn off some support, and many voters, particularly women, have been troubled by Mr. Rowland's efforts to suppress a police report on a domestic dispute with his ex-wife in April. After a surprise primary victory, Mr. Curry has campaigned aggressively, but in a close race he may lose critical votes to Mrs. Groark.

Rapoport, Democrat, A Connecticut Party UNITED STATES SENATE  CANDIDATES    GERALD LABRIOLA, 62, Republican, retired pediatrician, State Senator from 1981-83, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1982 and for the Republican nomination for governor in 1982 and 1986.    JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, 52, Democrat, United States Senator since 1991; State Attorney General from 1983-89, State Senator from 1971-81. THE ISSUES    Mr. Lieberman's TV advertising depicts him as an advocate for creating jobs, fighting crime and making Congress more accountable. Dr. Labriola, relying largely on handshaking and yard signs, assails Mr. Lieberman for backing President Clinton's budget plan last year, calling it the largest tax increase in history. Dr. Labriola says Mr. Lieberman \"fakes right and votes left.\" ANALYSIS    Mr. Lieberman has had a commanding lead in the polls from the beginning and a huge advantage in fund raising, allowing him to air television commercials that focus on his family and his achievements and do not mention his opponent. Dr. Labriola has had little money for television ads. Some Democratic Party analysts have predicted the most lopsided victory in state history. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES    SAM GEJDENSON, 45, Democrat, dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House of Representatives, seeking his eighth term.    EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 53, Republican, a retired statistician at Pfizer. Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr. Gejdenson in 1992, a race he narrowly lost. THE DISTRICT    The Second Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut. It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism jobs have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard. THE ISSUES    Mr. Munster campaigned last time on the argument that Mr. Gejdenson had lost his local bearings after more than a decade in Congress. This time, the debate has centered more on effectiveness. Mr. Munster's commercials attack Mr. Gejdenson's attendance record for major votes. Mr. Gejdenson's commercials say Mr. Munster failed to do much of note as a State Senator. ANALYSIS    Mr. Gejdenson did not appear to take Mr. Munster seriously in 1992, but he is fighting hard this time, trading blow for blow in a negative campaign that seems to have shifted the advantage to Mr. Gejdenson. He has portrayed his Washington savvy as reaping huge benefits for the district in business for military contractors. FIFTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES    GARY A. FRANKS, 41, Republican, seeking his third term, the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in 60 years. Former labor-relations executive.    JAMES H. MALONEY, 46, Democrat, State Senator from Danbury since 1986. THE DISTRICT    The district is economically diverse, encompassing wealthy enclaves like Wilton and Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide. THE ISSUES    Mr. Maloney, with far less name recognition or money than his opponent, has tried to portray Mr. Franks as a Congressman more interested in gaining a national reputation than serving constituents. Mr. Franks has contended that Mr. Maloney has no real agenda to pursue if elected. ANALYSIS    Mr. Franks was considered vulnerable in 1992, when Bill Clinton carried Connecticut in the Presidential election, but he won with a 43 percent plurality when two Democrats -- one running as an independent -- split the Democratic vote. This year, he could benefit from having John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, on the ticket. Mr. Rowland represented the district from 1985 to 1991, and remains popular there.

IDENTITY: Makeup artist. AGE: 32. RECENT PROJECTS: Fashion Week spring shows for Isaac Mizrahi, Donna Karan, DKNY, Richard Tyler for Anne Klein, Ralph Lauren, Todd Oldham; author of \"The Art of Makeup,\" (HarperCollins, 1994; $60). PAST CLIENTS: Tina Turner, Barbra Streisand, Roseanne, Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Ross, Susan Sarandon, Uma Thurman, Audrey Hepburn, Anjelica Huston, and Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Allure magazines. Q. How did you get into makeup? A. As I was growing up in Louisiana, people told me I was ugly. I think it was because I was effeminate. Mine is the story of the ugly duckling, about being able to see that you're not what everyone around you is telling you that you are. I became interested in the idea of transformation.     Where it stemmed from, for me, was the awareness from a very early age that I was gay, then hearing how awful and evil that was. Eventually I realized that was all lies, and then I started questioning what else I had heard that wasn't true. It was a wonderful springboard for me into the world of fashion and beauty, because it kept me from accepting what was and made me see the possibilities of what could be. Q. It's interesting that you translated notions of illusion into such a literal metaphor. A. It wasn't anything conscious, but I guess it was vicarious, in a way -- the idea that if I can make you look good and feel good about yourself, that makes me feel good about myself because I helped you.  Q. What's this glamour thing about? A. At a certain point in the 80's, there was a no-makeup movement, which was, I think, a political movement. I always think everything that happens in the fashion world is based on politics. In the 80's, people in the fashion world were losing their friends to AIDS, they were watching gay and lesbian civil rights being destroyed, there was an enormous amount of sexism going on. And the fashion business reacted in several ways.     During the beginning of the Reagan years, there was a real white-male view of women as Barbie dolls -- very glamorous, and voluptuous. So in the early 80's there was a lot of Big. Big hair, big makeup, big breasts. Then, suddenly, came the no-makeup movement. What it meant politically was that women don't have to wear makeup to be accepted. It's O.K. for women to be bare-faced. And not only is it O.K., it's good, it's a great look. And it was important to expand the boundaries of what we considered acceptable.     Now, there's a return to glamour because even the no-makeup look was becoming oppressive. Q. So the fashion world presents us with an extreme? A. Always. No one's going to go home and do their makeup the way we do it for a magazine. But you can go off and say \"Oh, purple's the message.\" It's not about saying, \"Go wear this to go out tonight,\" but rather: \"Oh, yellow! Color! I'll put a little spring into it.\" Q. Who creates trends, and how? A. There's a really small group of people that can make a big difference. It's not like some little committee, and it keeps changing, but it's a group of people who love women and feel a great respect for women, and most of them have their finger on the pulse of what's going on, in terms of what affects their lives.     Manipulation is not part of the inspiration. It's the desire to open up doors and make things more acceptable.     That's where Kristin McMenamy and Kate Moss come in. That's where Roshumba comes in, or Naomi Campbell, who has more traditional black features than most of the black models before her. When Steven Meisel brings Kristin to the American public and says, \"This is beauty, and it's not the typical all-American blonde,\" it's because Steven fights for it that America wakes up. Like Barbra Streisand. Those are the people I love and adore, because they are breaking the boundaries and creating more acceptance for everyone. Q. What are some of the runway makeup trends that are new and interesting? A. I'll tell you what I think is the most old-fashioned: a ton of foundation. I think what's new is someone with dark, smoky eyes -- yet you can see their skin -- and glossy lips. Not so long ago, there was a return to the 70's, but it was done very literally, copied from a 70's magazine, without any modern take on it, which to me is uninspiring.     What I'm here for, as a makeup artist, is to present women with options. A new option is to be inspired by a look from the past, and then make it modern. Q. Who's doing the most innovative makeup nowadays? A. The Japanese are light-years ahead of everyone else when it comes to formulating makeup. It's scary to me that American companies have no clue, compared to the Japanese. For the Japanese it's more of an art. For American companies it's about how much something will sell. Q. What looks do you like? A. The whole range, from a woman who's completely dressed up, has her hair pulled back, let's say, and wears a velvet coat, huge earrings and no makeup, except for some sort of oil in her face (I love skin that looks glowing like that). Women with a lot of makeup on also catch my eye.     I love the extremes. It's fascinating to see that someone's far up on either end of the spectrum. It says they're not afraid of being different. And those are the people I gravitate toward, because that's me. Q. Where do your ideas come from? A. I get a lot from children. I look at my niece -- her little cherub cheeks, rosy lips, long blond eyelashes, dark eyebrows -- and I think: \"That's it! That's the makeup for the show!\"     It's not at all about making women look just like little girls, either. It's just that my niece inspired me, just like I get ideas from old movies I watch. Q. Where do fashion and beauty go now? A. That depends on what happens in politics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Style"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"A Hot Investment Entices, But It's Not Always Wise","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/us/a-hot-investment-entices-but-it-s-not-always-wise.html","abstract":"  Do you pay too much in taxes?

That mission failed disastrously, and as German film exports under the Nazis fell, Goebbels turned his efforts toward conquering the audience at home. His theory was that propaganda worked best when an audience didn't know it was there. So while emigrant German film makers like Fritz Lang successfully planted the roots of film noir in Hollywood, those who stayed behind were given the far more difficult task of transplanting the light, optimistic American style to the Third Reich -- of creating a dream factory in hell.   The resulting Nazi doppelganger of Hollywood is on view in \"The Ministry of Illusion: German Film 1933-45,\" starting Friday at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which is a co-sponsor with Goethe House. The program of 29 movies, which runs through Nov. 30, is the first to focus on the entertainment films -- historical epics, melodramas, comedies and musicals, rarely screened and mostly unavailable on video -- that accounted for more than 85 percent of motion-picture production in the Third Reich.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Weegee's Grisly Images Gaze on These Dancers","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/arts/dance-weegee-s-grisly-images-gaze-on-these-dancers.html","abstract":"  \"I DON'T RELATE TO VIOLENT crime,\" the choreographer Susan Marshall was saying. \"No one in my circle of loved ones has ever been touched by that.\" As she talked while sipping tea in a cafe near her apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, her hands took the precaution of knocking on every wooden surface within reach, a comic ripple in her otherwise intense demeanor.    \"Unfortunately, I do know something about illness,\" she continued. \"It's a slower-acting violence but similar in its randomness.

Now, after years of fruitless debate, a solution may have arrived: A growing shortage of applicants is forcing the country's universities to consider the most farreaching changes since their founding.    Demographics rather than a shift in values is behind the new thinking. The birth rate is tumbling and Japanese society is aging with remarkable speed. Within 30 years the number of people over 65 will soar to 25 percent of the population, from the current 12 percent. The number of 18-year-olds peaked in 1992, and is expected to drop steadily in coming years.    Yoshiya Abe, an expert on education policy at Aichi Gakiun University, near Nagoya, said there would be 20 percent fewer university applicants in the year 2000, a figure that is sending shock waves through Japan's educational factories.    Now universities, which traditionally accepted only the students they wanted after putting them through a battery of mind-numbing exams, are changing their standards as they compete for students. They are accepting students based on recommendations or skill in sports like rugby. In other words, students are slowly finding their outside interests encouraged rather than regarded as distractions from the tasks of memorizing dates and facts.    In another change, universities have begun to trim costs. Up to now, parents have paid vast sums to insure their children spots at good universities because diplomas from the right schools -- rather than the student's academic record -- have been the most important criteria for jobs at the best companies and government ministries.    In a startling report issued earlier this year, the Government found that Japanese parents with two children spent nearly 16 percent of their incomes on education -- with much of it on cram schools to prepare youngsters for the rigorous and minutely detailed entrance exams at middle schools, high schools and universities. By contrast, the survey found, American parents spend on average less than 3 percent of their income on their children's education.

Ito draws back from his threat to ban the camera from the O. J. Simpson trial. That threat, which will be the subject of a hearing tomorrow, grew out of his annoyance at an inaccurate news report by a Los Angeles television station, not the actual courtroom coverage. On calm consideration it may occur to the judge that punishing courtroom television for the doings of a local station would be like jailing a felon's blameless cousin who happens to be within reach: guilt by relationship or accessibility.   As friends of courtroom coverage, including The New York Times editorial page, have pointed out, it is a form of television least susceptible to distortion. But critics, including Max Frankel, once the head of that editorial page and later executive editor of the newspaper, and now a columnist for The New York Times Magazine, find such reasoning superficial. They see the television camera not as an extension of the press but as a new sort of monster with the ability to cloud viewers' minds. \"Images on a screen,\" Mr. Frankel wrote, \"draw us into the action; they pound the emotions, bypass the mind.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"IN SHORT: FICTION","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/books/in-short-fiction.html","abstract":"HISTORICAL NOVEL\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER\nBy Barbara Chase-Riboud.\nCrown, $24.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Books"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Corrections","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/c-corrections-727695.html","abstract":"  A chart last Sunday with an article about the reduction in traffic on major Long Island roads included incorrect data.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Voting Isn't Pretty, but Somebody Has to Do It; Where the Mandate Is","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/opinion/l-voting-isn-t-pretty-but-somebody-has-to-do-it-where-the-mandate-is-749770.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Re \"Here Come the Republocrats\" (Op-Ed, Nov. 1): In advocating political abstinence, Ted Rall follows a curious logic. \"When you don't vote,\" he writes, \"you force politicians to reassess their policies and actions.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Voting Isn't Pretty, but Somebody Has to Do It; Those Good People","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/opinion/l-voting-isn-t-pretty-but-somebody-has-to-do-it-those-good-people-749761.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:    Re \"Here Come the Republocrats\" (Op-Ed, Nov. 1): Ted Rall's explanation why he is abstaining from voting calls to mind a comment made by the humorist John Henry Faulk.

Ms. Andrews's sensitive, stirring collection of 70 black-and-white photographs with accompanying oral histories, FAMILY: A Portrait of Gay and Lesbian America (HarperSanFrancisco, paper, $25), is an important record of 20th-century gay life and a joy to read. From the conventional to the outlandish, Ms. Andrews portrays an extraordinary range of subjects: a World War II veteran, shyly proud in his American Legion cap; the pastor of the Full Truth Unity Fellowship of Christ Church, singing a gospel song, eyes closed in ecstasy; a cowboy, muscular and self-assured, who rides on the gay rodeo circuit; a lesbian garden club in Georgia called the Digging Dykes of Decatur; even a Mardi Gras \"krewe\" or club, featuring transvestites in Las Vegas-style beaded costumes. Though the more eccentric photos grab attention, the substance of the book lies in its soulful depiction of people as simply themselves. Ms. Andrews's portraits are filled with texture and natural light and reveal a skillful photographer who makes her subjects comfortable. The text conveys each person's story and manner of speaking, and varies from rambling to eloquent. \"Family\" affirms gay men and lesbians in all their diversity, while widening the reader's image of what a family can be.

Six years ago, when only one out of six high school graduates entered universities, the Government announced that times were changing. It vowed to give more people the opportunity to get a university education and it set a target: One out of every three high school graduates would go on to higher education by the end of the century.   It didn't take nearly that long. As the Government, which subsidizes higher education in Britain, encouraged expansion by increasing the funds it provides to universities by almost a third, the number of students rose from 261,900 in 1988 to 436,200 in 1993.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Education"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"The Lore of the Custard Castle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/books/the-lore-of-the-custard-castle.html","abstract":"IN THE MOUNTAINS OF AMERICA\nBy Meredith Sue Willis.\n171 pp. San Francisco: Mercury House.

But did his name come up in connection with \"Pulp Fiction,\" a movie that some say transformed movie making? We think not.    Instead, it can be argued that Danny DeVito is not only the most powerful man in Hollywood but also the center of the universe. Through this actor-director-producer-beautician, anyone could theoretically get to anyone else. Producing, through his company Jersey Films, has made Mr. DeVito's reach all encompassing. The company's productions run the gamut of subjects (and studios) from \"Hoffa\" (20th Century Fox) to \"Reality Bites\" (Universal) to \"Pulp Fiction\" (Miramax). Next up: \"Get Shorty\" (MGM), starring John Travolta and \"Feeling Minnesota\" (New Line Cinema), starring Keanu Reeves. Mr. DeVito will also direct \"Matilda,\" based on the Roald Dahl children's book, for Universal. Here's how Mr. DeVito Links up to the universe. JOSH YOUNG GRAMMY WINNERS    Mr. DeVito appeared in \"Ruthless People\" with Bette Midler, opened for Barbra Streisand at a benefit for Bill Clinton and was born in Asbury Park, N.J., the town Bruce Springsteen put on the map. PEOPLE WITH TELEVISIONS    Nearly everyone remembers Mr. DeVito from the series \"Taxi.\" \"People pat me on the back, and say, 'Hey, how are Rhea and the kids?\"' Mr. DeVito said. Anyone deprived of \"Taxi\" has certainly been to \"Cheers,\" where Mr. DeVito's real-life wife, Rhea Periman, served drinks as Carla. WORLD LEADERS (INCLUDING MICHAEL OVITZ)    In \"Junior,\" which opens on Nov. 26, an airline flight attendant (played by Judy Ovitz, wife of Michael Ovitz) tries to eject the DeVito character from the First-class cabin. \"Let's face it, Danny knows everyone,\" says Ivan Reitman, the film's director. Also co-starring: Emma Thompson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Kennedy spouse and head of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during the Bush Administration. GENERATION X    For a 50-year-old, Mr. DeVito has impeccable credentials with 20-somethings. \"Reality Bits,\" directed by Ben Stiller, 28, and written by Helen Childress, 24, is known as the definitive Gen-X movie. If not for Mr. DeVito and his partner, Michael Shamberg, backing this film, the revival of the Knack's hit \"My Sharona\" might be years away. ALUMNI OF THE WILFRED ACADEMY OF HAIR AND BEAUTY CULTURE    The Wilfred Academy once had 58 branches in the New York area. After completing his studies in Asbury Park in 1964, Mr. DeVito got his beautician's license and practiced at his sister's salon. Told that all Wilfred outlets are now closed, Mr. DeVito sheepishly admitted, \"I haven't kept up with my alma mater.\" NEW HOLLYWOOD    Jersey Films has made movies at nearly every studio except its home base, Columbia Pictures, so it shouldn't be surprising if the company gets a film going with the new studio formed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen. During Mr. Katzenberg's reign at Walt Disney Studios, Mr. DeVito starred in three Disney films: \"Tin Men,\" \"Ruthless People\" and \"Renaissance Man.\" OLD HOLLYWOOD    Mr. DeVito's first turn on the golf course was with Jack Nicholson, a close friend since they appeared together in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest \" (1975). \"I played 18 holes my first time out, and I lost every ball in Jack's bag,\" Mr. DeVito said. \"Michael\" -- Michael Douglas, a pal since the 70's and a collaborator on four DeVito films -- \"is a golf enthusiast too, but I'm not getting out there with him.\" Mr. Nicholson's best friend is Warren Beatty. QUENTIN TARANTINO    Since the critical success of \"Pulp Fiction,\" Quentin Tarantino is a universe unto himself. Three years ago, Stacey Sher, president of Jersey Films, slipped Mr. DeVito and Michael Shamberg the script for \"Reservoir Dogs,\" then in production. Jersey Films bought Mr. Tarantino's next script, for \"Pulp Fiction,\" sight unseen and was the executive producer of the film, distributed through Miramax. \"The only guidance you need to give a guy that talented is what kind of lenses to use,\" Mr. DeVito said.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"Democrats On Defensive In a Handful Of Contests","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/the-1994-campaign-legislature-democrats-on-defensive-in-a-handful-of-contests.html","abstract":"  The Democrats are on the defensive in a handful of contested legislative races around New York State this year, and while the Republicans could pick up seats in both the Assembly and the Senate, the gains would not upset the balance of power in either house and seem unlikely to have any sway in the death-penalty debate.

Women with the highest antennas seem to be mirroring what was shown in some of the best New York designer collections.    The look is still only a trickle on the scene (and stores report sales for it have done poorly). But it is a style that recalls women in the paintings of the artist Reginald Marsh in the 1930's and 40's. The cut of the satin crepe bias-cut dresses and skirts has the same saucy sensuality. The hemline has stabilized at the top of the kneecap, and the overall image is one of understated plainness in somber black, navy, ivory, beige and an occasional brown.

Pataki, and to stress his ties to United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Green, who lost a bid to unseat Mr. D'Amato in 1986, said a victory by Mr. Pataki would turn the state government into what the Mayor called \"a government of D'Amato, for D'Amato and by D'Amato.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19941106","headline":"72d St. Riders Protest Delay In Repairs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/nyregion/neighborhood-report-upper-west-side-72d-st-riders-protest-delay-in-repairs.html","abstract":"  Four years after West Siders were told that the subway station at Broadway and 72d Street would be renovated and expanded, news that the project has been deferred indefinitely for lack of funds has ignited outrage from local residents, who staged a rally on Thursday night to call attention to what they say are the station's dangerous conditions.
