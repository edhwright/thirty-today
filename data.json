He has been fighting with the elected parliamentary majority, a coalition of parties descended from the old Communist dictatorship, and now threatens to exercise his power to dissolve Parliament and force new legislative elections.   Though Mr. Walesa portrays himself as a beleaguered defender of market reform and democracy, many Poles see him as a clumsy and sometimes undemocratic maneuverer primarily seeking his own re-election this November. Winning will not be easy. The former electrician and Nobel laureate, who led the Solidarity union movement to power in the 1980's, must overcome abysmal poll numbers that reflect a reputation for erratic leadership.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950207","headline":"Documents Show F.A.A.

Having given efficient performances of the Debussy Sonata and a set of Beethoven Variations, and more winning readings of Mendelssohn and Beethoven Sonatas, they offered the Adagio from Rachmaninoff's Cello Sonata as an encore. They stepped thoroughly into the work's spirit, Mr. Harrell supplying a melting tone and shapely phrasing and Mr. Bronfman matching his performance closely in both gesture and warmth.    It was a long way from the Debussy to this. Mr. Bronfman had started the Sonata with a hard-eged reading that deprived the work of some of its mystery. Mr. Harrell softened those edges somewhat, but even so, a listener was primarily taken with his technical resources -- his speed, precision and coloration -- rather than with his ability to evoke the magic and exoticism of Debussy's world.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950207","headline":"Plumbing the Depths of Two Sad, Vacuous Lives","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/07/theater/theater-review-plumbing-the-depths-of-two-sad-vacuous-lives.html","abstract":"  The title character of Austin Pendleton's \"Uncle Bob\" is a familiar type in 20th-century American fiction, from John O'Hara to Joseph Heller.

The message from a prestigious group of experts in preventive medicine and exercise physiology was this: you don't have to become a jock or a fitness nut, you don't have to exercise vigorously three times a week for 20 minutes at a time and you don't have to build muscles a la Arnold Schwarzenegger to reap major health benefits from regular physical activity.   All you have to do, these experts concluded, is to incorporate a total of about 30 minutes a day of moderate activity into your routines. That means actions like taking stairs instead of elevators and escalators, walking short distances instead of driving door to door, gardening, raking leaves, doing housework, dancing, playing actively with children or pets, riding a stationary bicycle while watching the evening news, playing golf without a cart or doing any other activities at the intensity of a brisk walk for however long you choose -- as long as you log a total of 30 minutes a day.

To those who have assiduously pursued the fitness gospel of exercising three or more times a week for 20 or more minutes at a time at a level that gets the heart beating at a rate of 60 to 90 percent of its maximum, the new guidelines may sound like heresy or at least a capitulation to a basically sedentary society that has so far largely resisted the exhortations to work up a sweat.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950208","headline":"Mutombo an All-Star, After All","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/sports/sports-people-basketball-mutombo-an-all-star-after-all.html","abstract":"  Denver Nuggets center DIKEMBE MUTOMBO, who complained bitterly last week about the National Basketball Association's lack of recognition for defensive players after he was passed over for the All-Star team, was named to the Western Conference squad yesterday.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19950208","headline":"For Citizen Cuomo, a Law Job and a Book Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/nyregion/for-citizen-cuomo-a-law-job-and-a-book-deal.html","abstract":"  Turning down a lucrative offer to be the host of a daily talk-radio show, former Gov.

the circuit of blues bars and rock clubs, all the way to a major-label contract and an album, \"Relish\" (Mercury), to be released in late March. Her voice, full of raw-throated emotion and bluesy finesse, helped propel her. But unlike many good-timey singers around the country, Ms. Osborne has more to offer than party anthems. At the Mercury Lounge on Tuesday night, she and a new band previewed her new album, in a set of remarkable songs that contemplate sex and faith, despair and trust, pleasure and loss.   Ms. Osborne's songs carry the essentials of roots rock -- blues riffs, soul vamps, a folky twang -- into a modern urban setting. She has plenty of vocal technique, from Bonnie Raitt's blues turns to Balkan glottal stops, but she uses it to illuminate the songs, not to show off. In \"St. Teresa,\" she had a hoarse, ravaged voice to sing about a drug-addicted prostitute; she was sweetly comforting in \"Crazy Baby,\" pleading with a depressed friend not to commit suicide.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Davis Hopes Practice Routines Will Leave Jitters Behind","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/sports/figure-skating-davis-hopes-practice-routines-will-leave-jitters-behind.html","abstract":"  His stomach churning triple axels, his confidence spiraling into a death-drop spin, his nerves turning to slush, Scott Davis has resorted to an extreme cure for his stage fright -- virtual reality.

The NATO line is that expansion has its own timetable, with a study of requirements for new members under way this year, and that turbulence anywhere, including Chechnya or the Kremlin itself, is irrelevant to that timing.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Bridge","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/nyregion/bridge-995395.html","abstract":"  We are always advised not to leap from the frying pan into the fire, but there are rare occasions on which the fire proves preferable.

But no longer. Indeed, President Clinton must have envied those days as he searched for someone to take the job overseeing a troubled Central Intelligence Agency and a constellation of other espionage organizations, all becalmed in the aftermath of the cold war. Several good candidates turned down the daunting but essential business of overhauling the intelligence services and their $28 billion annual budget.   The man who ultimately accepted, Michael Carns, a retired Air Force general, is a sound choice, with the potential to be a distinguished one. General Carns, who served as vice chief of staff for the Air Force and is a graduate of Harvard Business School, brings extensive management experience to the job. He could provide what the C.I.A. desperately needs -- a strong executive to pull the agency together after the trauma of the Aldrich Ames case, the most serious American espionage betrayal of the cold war.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950209","headline":"Congress Isn't Eager to Play Hardball in the Big Leagues","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/sports/baseball-congress-isn-t-eager-to-play-hardball-in-the-big-leagues.html","abstract":"  As bad baseball metaphors rained on Capitol Hill like so many fungoes at fielding practice, Republicans insisted en masse today that President Clinton's proposal for a legislated end to the baseball strike is the wrong solution, offered at the wrong time.
