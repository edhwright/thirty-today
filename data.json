The secret is never mentioned by the characters whose lives it threatens to ruin. Having no name, it can't be spoken even on a dare. Instead, it's always referred to indirectly, and with a kind of puzzled Christian innocence that denies the secret's corrosive effects. Mr. Foote's characters say that everything's all right, but he knows better.   After \"Talking Pictures\" and \"Night Seasons,\" the Signature Theater Company continues its season devoted to the playwright with a first-rate production of a work that will haunt you long after the performance. \"The Young Man From Atlanta\" is both quintessential Horton Foote and, in terms of subtext, one of his least characteristic works.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Theater"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Neo-Fascists Remodel Their Party in Italy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/world/neo-fascists-remodel-their-party-in-italy.html","abstract":"  In the final hour of Italy's neo-Fascist party, which died here this weekend to make way for a more moderate successor, a wave of emotion swept through the delegates to a party congress.

Sir Michael Rose, whose one-year tenure as U.N. commander in Bosnia ended last week, had a thankless assignment. He was supposed to protect civilians in Bosnia's besieged cities, but had neither the mandate nor the means to repulse their Serbian besiegers. In theory, the U.N. is neutral between aggressors and victims in Bosnia's dirty war.   Even allowing for the toughness of the job, General Rose damaged the U.N.'s credibility. His efforts to avoid confrontation and protect his troops went beyond the narrow dictates of neutrality. He began well enough last January, cooperating with NATO efforts to get the Serbs to pull back artillery from the hills surrounding Sarajevo. But when the Serbs shifted their attention to Gorazde, General Rose impeded effective NATO air strikes. Later, he seemed to encourage Serbian military operations around Sarajevo's airport. Most recently, at Bihac, he seemed to ignore the Security Council's instructions to protect civilians.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19950130","headline":"Clinton Tests Cooler Congressional Waters on Raising the Minimum Wage","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/us/clinton-tests-cooler-congressional-waters-on-raising-the-minimum-wage.html","abstract":"  After a month of trial balloons and uncertainty within the Administration over how best to push for a higher minimum wage, this much has become clear: the White House is still grappling with the question of how best to act in a new political world dominated by a Republican Congress.

After that, he was not certain about taking Mr. Greeley to New York, where Lasix and other medications are outlawed.

In a concert performance by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, this tale of a hapless, disturbed soldier beaten down by poverty, sleeping in sordid barracks, earning pennies by subjecting himself to perverse medical experiments and by submissively shaving the beard of a pompous military officer -- this tale of the archetypal modern victim -- actually became hauntingly lovely. Its horrific exclamations, sickly dances and unnerving juxtapositions were not distressing but fascinating; its characters almost seemed to take on abstract roles in a large-scale symphony.    The cast for this unusual exploration of the score was one of the best that can currently be assembled. The singers would have blossomed in a different direction in conventional operatic settings, but here they gave an esthetic polish to the jagged drama. Hildegard Behrens's singing as Marie, the soldier's mistress, was unblemished by the intermittent difficulties that have plagued her during recent seasons; in fact, her voice seems to have passed through a refiner's fire.

Gov. George E. Pataki wants to deny parole to violent felons and change New York's sentencing system so it would impose fixed flat sentences instead of minimum and maximum terms. And last week he signed an executive order barring violent felons from work-release programs. The Governor hopes to avoid the need for more prison space by loosening laws that require jail time for low-level drug dealers. Connecticut abolished parole completely in the early 80's but brought it back because of prison overcrowding and fiscal difficulties. According to the New York State Division of Parole, it costs about a tenth as much to supervise a person on parole as to house that person in prison. Graphs show the number of parolees to parole officers, the number of parole violations in 1993, the parole budgets in New York and New Jersey, and the cost of supervision in N.Y., N.J. and Conn.

The most common type is known as sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin found in red blood cells. This leads to the red blood cells adopting an abnormal sickle-like shape under certain circumstances; with this shape, they are unable to deform as they pass through capillaries, causing blockages. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain in joints, anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, dizziness and stroke. The probability of severe symptoms, including long-term pain, increases with age. Without treatment, people with SCD rarely reach adulthood but with good healthcare, median life expectancy is between 58 and 66 years. All of the major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver, heart, kidneys, gallbladder, eyes, bones, and joints can be damaged from the abnormal functions of the sickle cells and their inability to effectively flow through the small blood

Hadja Soumano and Leou Tirera, two women from Mali, were accompanied by a superb, unnamed band at S.O.B.'s on Wednesday, and two nights later, Baaba Maal, from Senegal, and his band, Daande Lenol (\"voice of the people\"), were at Irving Plaza.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950131","headline":"Smithsonian Scales Back Exhibit Of B-29 in Atomic Bomb Attack","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/31/us/smithsonian-scales-back-exhibit-of-b-29-in-atomic-bomb-attack.html","abstract":"  This spring, when the Smithsonian Institution displays part of the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan, it will be accompanied only by a small plaque and perhaps a video interview with its flight crew.

The latest example is a bizarre byproduct of the notorious Intel Pentium bug. Fire up a spreadsheet that originated on a buggy Pentium machine, run it on one with a new chip, and you may discover that two identical math computations can produce two answers, one right and one wrong.   The original Pentium chips, you will recall, caused very occasional errors in division. Just how occasional remains a matter of dispute, but the ensuing outcry was enough to prod the Intel Corporation into offering to replace the defective chips for anyone who complained. The toll-free number for starting the replacement process is (800) 628-8686.

As in opera and song, words are central. But in those forms the composer dictates pitch, rhythm, tempo, phrasing and coloration, effectively controlling the text's expressive power. In melodrama, the words and the reader's mastery of it are central. The music can be supportive, illuminating or in the way, but it is inescapably secondary.   The trick, of course, is to make the music seem so integral that a plain reading would seem naked without it. The Unterberg Poetry Center at the 92d Street Y posed this challenge to Lee Hoiby, Ned Rorem and Robin Holloway, three composers best known for their expertise at setting texts. Each was commissioned to write a work for speaker and piano -- specifically, for Claire Bloom and Brian Zeger -- and their very different solutions were given premieres on Monday evening in a program called \"Women in Mind.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950201","headline":"1990's Decadence Hits a New Low","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/style/1990s-decadence-hits-a-new-low.html","abstract":"ALICE MEDRICH introduced the world to golf-ball-size truffles and her definitive version of chocolate decadence cake, benchmarks for gastronomic sybarites of the 1980's, through her seven Cocolat stores in the San Francisco area.

Ewing has been an All-Star more often than anyone else in the Knicks' history, surpassing the seven appearances of both Walt Frazier and Willis Reed. And this year's trip to the All-Star Game on Feb. 12 in Phoenix may be more special to Ewing than some of the others.   After undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in July, Ewing missed the entire preseason and started the regular season slowly.
