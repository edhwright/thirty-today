Now the plan is threatened by budget cuts, inadequate materials and pessimism among principals and teachers. Despite hurdles, Mr. Cortines must keep pushing forward -- for the sake of students and the city.    One of the legacies of former Chancellor Joseph Fernandez was a requirement that city high school students take three years of math and, beginning in 1995, three years of science. That requirement, however, was diminished by allowing it to be fulfilled with \"non-academic\" courses like consumer math, which was basically applied arithmetic.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"Along the Andersonstown Road, Relief and Armed Patrols","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/world/cease-fire-northern-ireland-neighborhoods-along-andersonstown-road-relief-armed.html","abstract":"  Christine Williams did not turn around when the armored patrol car slowed at the curb behind her and the two helmeted British soldiers inside warily eyed the evening strollers along the Andersonstown Road.   \"You know, I've been looking over my shoulder for a long time,\" said Mrs. Williams, 43, as the soldiers, rifles pressed to their soldiers, continued slowly up the road past the rundown video stores and curry shops and newsstands. \"But tonight, for maybe the first time in 25 years, I actually feel relaxed out here.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"No Headline","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/nyregion/no-headline-113174.html","abstract":"  \"This is a tragedy for everybody on both sides.

The N.A.A.C.P., like most civil rights groups, made racism its focus in combating the forces of inequality that strangled opportunities for blacks at the beginning of this century. Its specialty of attack was painstakingly shaped in our nation's courtrooms. Its piece de resistance -- the legal brief -- was fashioned by scholars and advocates like Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall, who raised the defense of black interests to high, dramatic art.

Its two commuter rail lines, Metro North and the Long Island Rail Road, which had dismal service in the early 80's, are now excellent. Even the subways are substantially better than they were a decade ago (although they still have a long way to go). As quality has picked up, so has the number of riders.   There is one glaring exception to all this success: ridership on city buses is down almost 50 percent over the last 30 years. Much of the decline has come in the last decade, which saw a 6 percent increase in commuter rail and subway ridership. The total demise of the bus system is within sight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"BUSINESS DIGEST","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/nyregion/business-digest-115258.html","abstract":"  NATIONAL FIGURES SWARM TO ALBANY RACE With the possible exception of California's gubernatorial race, no statewide election this year is drawing more attention from politicians with an eye on the 1996 Presidential election than the New York campaign, top Democratic and Republican officials say.

B3. BOMB TRIAL IS POSTPONED UNTIL DECEMBER Acting over the objections of 11 defendants, a Federal judge postponed for more than two months the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 12 others accused of conspiring to wage a war of urban terrorism on the United States. B3. EMERGENCY SHELTERS WITHOUT KITCHENS Struggling to find shelter for the more than 150 homeless families who are sleeping in New York City offices each night, the city will again put homeless families in hotel rooms without kitchens because its existing shelters are full. B3. GETAWAY CAR HITS BICYCLE, KILLING A BOY A car chase through the Hollis section of Queens, with robbers in one car exchanging gunfire with a store owner in another, ended after the robbers' car struck and killed a teen-ager riding his bicycle, the police said. B3. REGION  MAN SUSPECTED IN SERIAL DEATHS  In the last two years, five prostitutes have been found strangled in Bridgeport, Conn. On Saturday, a man confessed to killing one prostitute that morning and trying to kill another. The police say that he may have been involved in some of the earlier killings.

The Overlook Press. $23.95   \"I would rather sell peanuts in Mexico than make films at Fox,\" Jean Renoir wrote, in an uncharacteristically griping mood, to his friend the screenwriter Dudley Nichols. When this great French director arrived in Hollywood at the start of World War II, he was not prepared for the way studios would cramp his brilliant, graceful style. Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, actually took over the editing of Renoir's first American film, \"Swamp Water,\" a story of love and injustice in the Georgia bogs. Yet Renoir did more than survive in Hollywood. He adopted the whole country, if not its methods of film making, and died at home in Beverly Hills in 1979, at the age of 84.    The paradox of the auteur in Hollywood is just a piece of Renoir's huge, eventful life. He was born 100 years ago, on Sept. 15, 1894, and his career spans the history of movie-making itself. His work ranged from silent films to Technicolor classics (Anna Magnani in \"The Golden Coach\") to television.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940901","headline":"For Football Union, A Cap Is No Big Deal","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/01/sports/on-baseball-for-football-union-a-cap-is-no-big-deal.html","abstract":"  More than 750 striking major league baseball players missed their first paychecks yesterday.

A report this week by New York's Citizens Budget Commission challenges this stereotype in useful and enlightening ways. It shows that women on welfare make up a far smaller percentage of the poor than popular wisdom would have it. It also confirms what previous studies have shown: Medicaid, not welfare, is the prime source of runaway spending on poverty.   Welfare mothers are routinely portrayed as slackers who make up the bulk of the poor and soak up more money every year. The fact is that only one in four poor households in New York City is headed by a single parent; welfare payments, when adjusted for inflation, have actually declined by 30 percent since 1972.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940902","headline":"Pentagon Estimates It Will Cost $427 Million to Invade Haiti","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/02/world/pentagon-estimates-it-will-cost-427-million-to-invade-haiti.html","abstract":"  Pentagon experts have estimated that an invasion of Haiti would cost $427 million on top of nearly $200 million already spent rescuing Haitians who have fled the country by boat and building camps for them, Defense Department officials said today.

This strong bill brings together three generations of avant-garde musicians. Mr. Conrad, best known for his work in the 1960's with the Minimalist composer La Monte Young, rarely performs nowadays. But his few recent concerts, where he stands silhouetted behind a screen and plays long, overtone-filled drones on the violin while a small, homemade mechanical contraption bows a second violin, have been loud, intense and beautiful. Mr. Sharp is a multi-instrumentalist who has been performing in New York City for 15 years, improvising with and composing for scores of musicians and creating dense musical textures out of a double-necked guitar and a sound sampler. Mr. O'Rourke, who also plays in the abstract rock band Gastr del Sol, is among the youngest brains in the avant-garde, working with field recordings and processing his guitar playing not to make music but to create a landscape of sound.

The next thing we know, he is at work as an orderly in the psychiatric section of a hospital. He sneakily reads the chart of a beautiful young woman and becomes intrigued by her. Eventually they become lovers, or so he imagines. Maybe she imagines it, too.   As the man moves from the bright daylight of the restaurant to the claustrophobic, hauntingly photographed hospital, this shrewd film follows a similar pattern.

The unmistakable whiff of cooler weather -- yes, it's out there, even if the thermometer lies and reads 90 -- is a preview of coming attractions, a teaser for full-tilt fall, when leaves die but New York City comes to life.

Thee Hypnotics differed from their British contemporaries, however, by also looking to the proto-heavy metal of the Stooges, a noisy late-1960's Detroit group led by Iggy Pop.

I have sent quite a few,\" wrote Lieut. Joe Tom Meador in a letter to his parents dated June 17, 1945, two months after a collection of 10 priceless medieval church treasures disappeared from a closely guarded cave on the outskirts of Quedlinburg in central Germany. The Nazi Government had hidden them there for safekeeping during World War II.   \"There are two that I want to know about for sure,\" he continued. \"One is a box that contains a book, the cover of the book has a statue of Christ on it. By all means, if it gets home take extra good care of it. I have an idea that the cover is pure gold and the jewels on the cover are emeralds, jade and pearls. Don't ask me where I got it! But it could possibly be very very valuable.\"    Lieutenant Meador's identity as the Quedlinburg thief was disclosed by The New York Times in June 1990. Lawyers representing the Government of West Germany and the owner of the treasure, the cathedral called the Stiftskirche Domgemeinde Quedlinburg, promptly filed suit in Federal District Court in Dallas to recover the artworks. Letters Are Uncovered    In 1992, an out-of-court settlement between German officials and Lieutenant Meador's heirs led to the exhibition of the treasures at the Dallas Museum of Art that spring before they were returned to Germany. The next year they were exhibited before overflow crowds at the State Museum for Decorative Arts in Berlin, and last September they were finally returned to Quedlinburg.    The letters from the Quedlinburg thief to his family in Whitewright, Tex., a farm town 15 miles south of the Oklahoma border, were recently inspected by The New York Times.   They make clear that Lieutenant Meador, who studied art with his mother and taught art in the high school in New London, Tex., before entering the Army, recognized the unusual value of what he was stealing. When Lieutenant Meador's brother and sister were trying to sell the treasures after his death, they asserted that he had found them \"in the gutter\" and considered them of little value.   Current professional estimates of the value of the collection range from nearly $200 million to \"priceless.\"   The letters also demonstrate that the theft of the Quedlinburg treasures by Lieutenant Meador, who died of cancer in 1980, was not an isolated indiscretion by a war-weary soldier. He mentions having sent home two moving picture projectors, camera lenses, other optical instruments and clothing. Warning to Parents    Furthermore, he cautioned his parents not to show the treasures to anyone and later confessed that he had \"appropriated\" the artworks \"from a cave in the mountains.\"   The treasures had been kept for a millennium in the Schatzkammer, or treasure chamber, of the Quedlinburg cathedral. After Allied air attacks on Germany began, the treasures were moved to a cave outside of town.   Lieutenant Meador stole the treasures when his unit, the 87th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, was briefly stationed in Quedlinburg in the waning days of the fighting in Europe.   Apart from their physical beauty, the treasures have great historical importance to Germany because of their association with Heinrich I, a 10th-century Saxon ruler who united an early configuration of German-speaking states.   The most valuable item in the collection is the Samuhel Gospels, a sumptuously illustrated and illuminated ninth-century manuscript lettered with gold ink. It contains full-page paintings of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the four Gospel scribes, which are among the earliest and best-preserved examples of early Western painting.   The other treasures include a gold, silver and ivory casket from the ninth or 10th century, a biblical manuscript dated 1513 and emblazoned with gold, silver and jewels; a liturgical ivory comb dating to the seventh or eighth century; five fancifully shaped reliquaries of cut rock crystal dating to the 10th century and a heart-shaped vessel believed to have been fashioned in the 15th century. The Loot Declines    In a letter to his parents dated July 7, 1945, Lieutenant Meador said the second medieval manuscript he had sent home was bound in solid gold covers encrusted with nearly 80 jewels. \"Please store it most carefully for me as it is very valuable,\" he stated.   A week later, he wrote that he had sent home \"a chest of the same type except the chest has a bunch of ivory inlay in it.\"   By Aug. 2, 1945, he was bemoaning the scarcity of easily available \"loot.\"   \"Now that the war is over it is harder to get things,\" he complained.   The next December, Lieutenant Meador was court-martialed and fined $600 for the theft of valuable silverware and gold-decorated china from the villa of the Marquise of St. Carlos in Biarritz, France. Although the Army investigated the theft of the Quedlinburg treasures after the war, they were not traced to Lieutenant Meador at that time.   In the out-of-court settlement in 1992, Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the siblings and heirs of Lieutenant Meador, received nearly $2.75 million from the German Government for relinquishing all claim to ownership of the artworks. The case has been investigated by the Internal Revenue Service, which, according to people close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity, is now demanding $30 million in back taxes, interest and penalties from the Meadors.   \"The I.R.S. is attempting to levy a tax and we expect to have to challenge it in tax court,\" Randal Mathis, the Dallas lawyer who represents the Meadors, said last week.   In a book about the case published in Germany last week, Willi A. Korte, a German investigator, says he has evidence that two of the treasures are still unlawfully in the United States and held by persons other than the heirs.   He says he has sworn statements from people in the Dallas area who have been able to describe or recognize photographs of artworks long missing from Quedlinburg. These include a rock crystal flask in the shape of a bishop's cap and a gold reliquary in the form of a crucifix.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940903","headline":"1944: Hitler to Speak : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/03/opinion/IHT-1944-hitler-to-speak-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html","abstract":"LONDON - [From our New York edition:] Adolf Hitler, reported by German diplomats to be planning a sensational speech Sunday [Sept. 3], probably will announce the crossing of the German frontier by General George S.
