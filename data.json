In her keynote speech, the director Anne Bogart commented on the astonishing productivity of Broadway, where in 1927 alone there were 268 openings covered by critics from the 24 New York City daily newspapers. While recognizing the contribution of musical theater, she was quick to add that it was paralleled by experimentation in drama: Eugene O'Neill and Sophie Treadwell shared a spotlight with Rodgers and Hart.

It quotes the \"Dies Irae\" -- the plainchant for the dead -- which also figures prominently in the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.

ON THE SCREEN: A couple, Harry and Louise, is sitting over breakfast. He is reading a newspaper, she a published version of the President's health care plan. The camera angle changes, and we see the health care plan from above as Louise underlines a passage with a yellow marking pen. At the end of the ad, an 800 number appears along with a tag identifying the sponsors. THE SCRIPT: Harry: \"I'm glad the President's doing something about health care reform.\"....Louise: \"He's right. We need it.\"... Harry: \"Some of these details--\"... Louise: \"Like a national limit on health care?\"... Harry: \"Really.\" ...Louise: \"The government caps how much the country can spend on all health care and says, 'That's it!\"'...Harry: \"So what if our health plan runs out of money?\"...Louise: \"There's got to be a better way.\" ACCURACY: The implication of the ad is that under the President's plan, only a certain amount of money can be spent on health care, and after that, patients will be out of luck. The President has proposed a complicated set of regulations to limit the rate in increase in health care spending to the inflation rate. Among other things, these regulations would limit the amount that health insurance premiums could rise each year. Many health care providers are concerned that the limits would adversely affect the quality of care and that some health care plans might actually run out of money. The President's proposal also calls for each state to set up contingency funds to bail out insolvent plans. SCORECARD: The ad purports to reflect the concerns of average citizens, and it effectively appeals to a generalized sense that the Clinton Administration's plan doesn't quite add up. But the ad has an melodramatic, overacted quality that may make viewers suspicious. And once they learn the ad is sponsored by the insurance industry, these suspicions are only likely to increase.

The 15 works on view were made by Pollock in 1948 and 1949, when he was creating, on canvas, some of his greatest and most influential drip paintings. The selections at C&M Arts are also drip paintings, and also great, but they are relatively small, executed for the most part on paper measuring no more than 22 by 30 inches.

The two countries will play a soccer match here Friday in this final round of Asian World Cup qualifying. It will be their first official international match in 17 years, and although players and coaches have done their utmost to minimize the history, there is little doubt that this game still holds special meaning. Both teams need a victory to maintain a reasonable chance of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States. Iran is 1-1, losing to South Korea but defeating Japan. Iraq lost to North Korea and tied South Korea. 'We Can Never Forget'    \"You must remember,\" said midfielder Hamid Derakhshan, the Iranian captain. \"Face to face, we are friendly now and say hello, but inside, we can never forget what happened between us.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19931022","headline":"Art in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/arts/art-in-review-532193.html","abstract":"  'Ann Hamilton'  'Tropos'  Dia Center for the Arts 548 West 22d Street Chelsea Through June 19    In \"Tropos,\" Ann Hamilton's latest installation-performance work, the artist once more orchestrates several emotionally charged elements in the vicinity of a meaning that remains tantalizingly yet irritatingly vague.

Nor would it advise whether older women, who studies have shown benefit from mammograms, should have the test every year or every other year.

(AP)   FIGURE SKATING  Harding Takes Lead  Tonya Harding of Portland, Ore., the 22-year-old former United States champion, skated the best technical program of her life last night to take the lead after the preliminariy program at Skate America in Dallas over the reigning world champion, Oksana Bayul of Ukraine. Harding skated deliberately but cleanly last night, landing a triple Lutz, double-toe combination, a double loop and a double axel. The four-minute long program will count for 66 percent of the total score.

This by no means ends American involvement in a United Nations operation, since 6,300 U.S. troops remain in Somalia, and 3,600 U.S. marines are deployed offshore. But Mr. Clinton seems finally to realize that commando raids and the civilian deaths that result from them can't cure what is ailing Somalia.    Taken together, the changed approach suggests that Mr. Clinton has heeded an aroused Congress and widespread bafflement over a humanitarian mission that by degrees turned into a bloody vendetta.

Where other repertory groups might change the emphasis in an interpretation, or open up solo space beyond the constraints of the original three-minute recording of a piece, the Carnegie Hall band radically rewrote the material.   The historical and creative liberty the band took comes not a moment too soon. It happened during the second half of the show, when the band began to play some Goodman tunes newly arranged by its pianist, Jim McNeely. It started with \"Air Mail Special,\" then moved into \"Stompin' at the Savoy\" and \"King Porter Stomp.\" Each of these pieces featured odd touches, and some nice, sly dissonances that seemed to cram too many notes into too small a space; \"King Porter Stomp\" had two clarinets harmonizing on the melody.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"Administration Is Fighting Itself On Haiti Policy","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/world/administration-is-fighting-itself-on-haiti-policy.html","abstract":"  The Clinton Administration appears to be at war with itself over policy toward Haiti and the Haitian leader supported by the White House, the Rev.

It may be rife with flaws, but it is also ripe with melodic invention, vigorous dramatic sequences and inventive ensemble pieces. And it is by a composer who pretty much defined the grand opera tradition: Giuseppe Verdi.    The opera, \"Stiffelio,\" written between \"Luisa Miller\" and \"Rigoletto,\" disappeared from the world's stages soon after its 1850 premiere not because it was a musical failure, but because its story about a Protestant minister who discovers his wife's infidelity fell afoul of the Roman Catholic censors. The libretto by Francesco Maria Piave was so disfigured by attempts to eliminate signs of a married religious leader considering divorce and murder that Verdi cannibalized the music and created a more artificial drama, \"Aroldo,\" out of the pieces.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19931023","headline":"The Next Kukoc Is Alive, Well and Waiting for the NBA","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/sports/IHT-the-next-kukoc-is-alive-well-and-waiting-for-the-nba.html","abstract":"The next Toni Kukoc, perhaps, is a shooting forward for an Italian team sponsored by a nonalcoholic beer.

The voices could be hushed and ethereal with little vibrato, as in medieval music, or clear and hearty. Then, suddenly, a downward slide or a yelp or a yodel would make clear that the choir had its own sonic traditions.
