Although the dynamics are low and the texture is unvarying, the music has a certain monumental aspect suited to performance outdoors, at least the fairly intimate surroundings of the Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art. At an exceptionally well-attended Summergarden concert there on Friday night, Joel Sachs drew a polished performance from a group of Juilliard players, with Nan Hughes and Renee Santer singing solos in lovely, haunting fashion.   One is accustomed to annoying distractions at outdoor concerts, but during the first scene of \"Socrate,\" Alcibiades' monologue at the banquet, there was a rather magical visual accident that might have been devised by Satie himself. Shortly after the music began, a film at the Modern's theater ended, and moviegoers began to issue from the escalator on the other side of the plate-glass windows. The slow, sad stepping motion of the music matched this long, silent procession to an almost uncanny degree.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940801","headline":"Hitler Plot Had No Bearing on War's Outcome; Morality Drove Them","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/01/opinion/l-hitler-plot-had-no-bearing-on-war-s-outcome-morality-drove-them-830348.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   In \"Germans Need Their Martyrs\" (Op-Ed, July 19), Donald Koblitz describes the key members of the resistance, among whom was my grandfather, Ulrich von Hassell, as a \"group of reactionary German aristocrats.\" He also states that \"these men had not been enraged by the seizure of Poland and Czechoslovakia or the extermination of European Jews,\" and that they joined the opposition \"only when the army could see the tide turning.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940801","headline":"U.N.

It will be televised by \"Live From Lincoln Center\" on PBS and seen by millions of viewers.   There will be a debate between Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of the program, and the writer James Lincoln Collier, about Mr. Collier's contrarian opinions on Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong as well as his perception of the inadequacies of Mr. Marsalis's program at Lincoln Center. Tributes to the saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath and the trumpeter and fluegelhornist Art Farmer will feature newly commissioned compositions and arrangements, along with small group performances.

The opera shows some daring in its attempt to trump the famous Glyndebourne production designed by David Hockney with costumes and sets by a lesser-known painter, Jorg Immendorff. It has a cosmopolitan character, with Sylvain Cambreling conducting an accomplished cast that includes the American singers Sylvia McNair, Jerry Hadley and Grace Bumbry. It stretches the conservative classical boundaries of the festival by being part of a miniature homage to Stravinsky (\"L'Histoire du Soldat\" is being staged, as well as Peter Sellars's much-awaited interpretation of \"Oedipus Rex,\" which will have its premiere in a few weeks).   And like much of Mr. Mortier's Salzburg programming, \"The Rake's Progress\" seems to flirt so dangerously with radical innovation that it cannot possibly work. Then it often does, creating an entirely new set of interpretations and possibilities. Controversy is guaranteed, but so are rewards; I hope this production will make its way to New York.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940803","headline":"N.B.A. Rejects 2 Contracts In Strategy for Salary Cap","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/03/sports/pro-basketball-nba-rejects-2-contracts-in-strategy-for-salary-cap.html","abstract":"  Citing a silver-lining clause in an otherwise adverse court ruling last year in the Chris Dudley case, the National Basketball Association is making a new effort to defend its salary cap against imaginative contracts.
