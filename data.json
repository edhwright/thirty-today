Its five movements, each inspired by a character or situation in the Superman comics, have more the character of a suite of scherzos or lively overtures, or what are now called concert openers. Yet an American composer trying to make his living at orchestral music is hard pressed to write anything but concert openers, so the symphony's somewhat ad hoc character might be overlooked.   The more pressing issue is whether Mr. Daugherty has come up with a style befitting the sexiness of his subject. Although he produces a distinctive texture -- thudding ostinatos, quick-cut jumps and shifts, swirling glissandos, sirens and rimshots and the like -- his harmonies are curiously static, his rhythms more often insistent than incisive. Echoes of Sibelius's Fourth Symphony, Britten's \"Sinfonia da Requiem,\" Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand (heard later on the program, as it happened) and even Franz Waxman's score for \"Sunset Boulevard\" collide in strangely joyless fashion, and with the exception of the darkly glowering \"Krypton\" movement the music never seems to take flight.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940112","headline":"Self-Esteem and Friendship In a Factory on Death Row","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/12/us/self-esteem-and-friendship-in-a-factory-on-death-row.html","abstract":"  The death row garment factory is humming at midday.

Mr. Sims (he used LaRoca as a stage name while working in Latin bands) is an exceptional drummer who combines the lightness of Billy Higgins's style and the rolling rhythms of Elvin Jones without sounding like either of them. He has a nicely cluttered sound when he solos; he'll hit the rims and the skin of a drum almost at the same time, giving his playing a chattery sound.

By the time it was revived on Broadway in 1973 with an all-star cast of hissers and scratchers, it had acquired the unmistakable gloss of high camp. Now, the director Anne Bogart has taken the work to a third, perhaps unavoidable level in its life as a pop-culture artifact: She has deconstructed it.

The Webern piece, brief as it is, even seemed to affect memories of the preceding night, when Parnassus, another of the city's neo-modernist groups, presented recent compositions at Columbia University's Miller Theater.    Webern must now be considered an old master, and this early piece, written in 1909, is not so ethereal and stringent as his later works. But the issues Webern faced throughout his life remained the same: how to create new compositional systems and sounds out of the wreckage of a long tradition. These issues persist in many of the programs presented by these performing groups, which have taken their stand in the modernist esthetic that Webern helped codify. In fact, the quartet's idiosyncratic phrasing, its skittish energy, its internal coherence and replicating and transforming gestures seemed to anticipate the ambitions of most of the other works on these programs.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940113","headline":"O'Brien Hurt in Fall","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/13/sports/sports-people-track-and-field-o-brien-hurt-in-fall.html","abstract":"  DAN O'BRIEN, the world champion and world-record holder in the decathlon, cut three fingers on his right hand and needed 10 stitches to close the wounds when he slipped on ice and fell outside his home in Moscow, Idaho.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940113","headline":"I.B.M.

And the scariest of all, whether in the news or in the forefront of popular culture, are suddenly high-powered career types with a yen to humiliate men. The motivating force in \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" the season's most popular film, is a woman who kicks her husband out for no good reason, and whose crisp professionalism is presented as her worst character flaw. Meanwhile, back at the bookstore, Michael Crichton's latest movie-on-paper is \"Disclosure\" (Alfred A. Knopf), about a female executive who connives her way to the top and then tries to force an ex-boyfriend to have sex with her.   \"Remember the night we broke the bed?\" Mr. Crichton's Meredith Johnson asks playfully, at the start of a closed-door session that is supposed to be a business meeting. But Tom Sanders is suspicious, as well he should be: Meredith forces a drink on him, then arranges for her assistant (also a woman) to deliver a package of condoms and lock the door to Meredith's office. If Senator Bob Packwood were accused of this particular behavior it might sound embarrassingly clumsy, but Mr. Crichton presents Meredith as a serious threat to Tom's well-being. \"She moved toward him in a steady, confident way, almost stalking,\" he writes in another scene.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Senator Accuses School Agency of Shoddy Repairs","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/nyregion/senator-accuses-school-agency-of-shoddy-repairs.html","abstract":"  Standing outside a Manhattan high school damaged by leaks, the chairman of the State Senate's Investigations Committee accused the School Construction Authority of shoddy repair work at dozens of public schools across New York City.

The possibilities are (1) that France has violated the European Charter on extradition to secure a market in Iran for its high-tech exports; (2) that it has yielded to Iranian threats of terrorism, and (3) that the Balladur Government, with an ear to anti-immigrant sentiment, places less value on human life if the victim is a non-European, like the Iranian dissident who was slain in Geneva.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"CLINTON IN EUROPE: Reporter's Notebook; President Finds Muscovites Warm but a Bit Preoccupied","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/world/clinton-europe-reporter-s-notebook-president-finds-muscovites-warm-but-bit.html","abstract":"  For most Russian politicians, the Clinton visit was a pleasant but not particularly relevant event during a week in which the new Russian Parliament was setting the stage for new battles with a new set of players elected just a month ago.   \"It would have been better if he had put it off for two months,\" said the former Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil Popov, \"until things here had had a chance to sort themselves out.\" Vadim V.

And looking at his sculptures and paintings in the show titled \"A Tribute to David Hare\" at the New York Studio School, one begins to see why. They are the work of an intelligent, purposeful, highly literate artist, but one who somehow got left behind in time, frozen in a style that many of his colleagues moved beyond.   Originally a photographer, Hare began making figurative sculpture in the early 1940's when European Surrealist art struck him with the force of a revelation. This watershed moment, however, coincided with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, a movement that established painting as the privileged international medium. (Hare himself didn't start to paint until the late 50's.) It also came at a time when many of his most adventurous New York colleagues were taking the plunge into pure abstraction. Hare didn't follow their lead. His devotion to Surrealism -- with its psychological preoccupations and its interest in fantasy and myth -- was complete, and would remain so for the rest of his life.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Inside Art","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/arts/inside-art.html","abstract":"  Not Heat, but Humidity    Frank Lloyd Wright took his time designing and building the Solomon R.

The assault on Kerrigan at last week's United States Figure Skating Championships will focus even more attention on how Kerrigan will perform at the Games in Lillehammer, Norway, and will probably help CBS exceed its previous high ratings for figure skating, the highest for any sport in the 1992 Winter Olympics.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Sports"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Let's Not Set Up an Orthodoxy for Ethics","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/opinion/l-let-s-not-set-up-an-orthodoxy-for-ethics-870234.html","abstract":"  To the Editor:   \"Fetal Ovary Transplant Is Envisioned\" (news article, Jan. 6), like so many other \"gee whiz\" articles on the ethics of medical technology, turns to professional \"ethicists\" for their opinions.

The unlikely marriage of what appear to be Shaker quilt patterns, African textile designs and suburban curtain fabric looks like a multiculturalist sendup, but Mr. Isermann has never been an artist interested primarily in irony. In fact, what continues to make his work engaging is exactly its wholehearted, even optimistic embrace of popular crafts, in this case one traditionally regarded as \"women's work.\" The results may be too blandly self-effacing to match the work of Robert Kushner and Alan Shields, artists who helped break the craft barrier 20 years ago, but Mr. Isermann is certainly on the right path.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Turning a Spotlight On a Life in Shadow; An Outsider Is Under Suspicion","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/nyregion/turning-a-spotlight-on-a-life-in-shadow-an-outsider-is-under-suspicion.html","abstract":"  For most of his 43 years, Lewis S. Lent Jr. lived on the margins of society, inhabiting a world epitomized by the job he held for the last seven years: cleaning the empty and silent theaters of an 11-screen multiplex in the wee hours of the morning. He came, with his own key, when the ticket-takers and moviegoers were long gone and the laughter and excitement were stilled. In turn, he was usually gone when the first employees came in for the new day.   But Mr. Lent, whose life is now at the center of a sprawling investigation into grisly charges of child abduction and murder, including the slaying of Sara Anne Wood in upstate New York, was not, by most accounts, the sort of morose loner who often turns up on a police blotter.","thumbnail":null,"section":"New York"},{"date":"19940114","headline":"Fossils Point to a Walking Ancestor of Whales","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/14/us/fossils-point-to-a-walking-ancestor-of-whales.html","abstract":"  Scientists have discovered unusually complete fossil remains of what could be an ancestor of modern whales that walked on land and hunted in the sea about 50 million years ago.
