Not surprisingly, the Library of Congress has not quite known what to do with the film. While it did put \"The Birth of a Nation\" on the National Film Registry in 1992, certifying it as a classic, the library has otherwise treated it as if it were toxic waste.

When the film was given an NC-17 rating, it was dropped by its distributor, Miramax. It is now being released without a rating by the Samuel Goldwyn Company.    But Mr. Lawrence has higher ambitions than to throw street language and sexual gestures at mainstream audiences. In \"You So Crazy,\" he creates a blunt comedy of hip-hop manners, and politeness has nothing to do with it. He paces around the stage, slipping easily and impressively in and out of many voices, accents, walks and faces. He imitates Hispanic people commiserating with blacks about the treatment of Rodney King (\"The way they beat Rodney Dangerfield was bad\"). He plays both parts in a conversation between a man and a woman trapped, through every fault of their own, in a bad relationship. And in his half-minute version of \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" he kicks old Daisy out of the car. That's the demure part.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Movies"},{"date":"19940427","headline":"Let the '50s Shine : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/opinion/IHT-let-the-50s-shine-letters-to-the-editor.html","abstract":"Regarding \"A Darker View of the '50s on a Desperate 'Carousel'\" (Opinion, April 1) by Frank Rich:.Probably the reason Lincoln Center audiences begin crying as soon as they hear \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" has less to do with the sensi","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940427","headline":"A Step Toward Gift Reform","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/opinion/a-step-toward-gift-reform.html","abstract":"  Yesterday the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee took an important step toward cleaning up a long-festering Congressional scandal: the gifts that lobbyists and other powerful interests give to lawmakers.

This is something so subtle that it can be missed on Ms. Bartoli's many recordings, which have built her reputation for charm and mastery, particularly in performances of Mozart and Rossini.

They are distinct from by-elections, which fill a seat that has become vacant between general elections. In most systems, a general election is a regularly scheduled election, typically including members of a legislature, and sometimes other officers such as a directly elected president. General elections may also take place at the same time as local, state/autonomous region, European Parliament, and other elections, where applicable.

The puck was stopped Valery Zelepukin. Tommy Albelin failed to clear the rebound, and Dave Hannan jumped on the loose puck and backhanded a shot that sailed over a fallen Brodeur.

That agenda emerged from three weeks of debate, confrontation and aggressive lobbying among delegates from 170 countries meeting at the United Nations this month. True, it is not yet the hoped-for consensus document that could serve as a blueprint for international family planning in the 21st century. But in recognizing that population and development policies must include the empowerment of women, it creates the right context for the Cairo discussions. The draft document acknowledges the inseparability of population control, equal rights, the environment and development.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940428","headline":"No Apparent Front-Runner To Fill Supreme Court Seat","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/us/no-apparent-front-runner-to-fill-supreme-court-seat.html","abstract":"  Senior White House officials said today that President Clinton hoped to select a nominee for the Supreme Court within two weeks, in time to hold hearings before the Senate's summer recess.

Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, denied Mr. Clinton the opportunity to select a candidate who would have probably been widely acclaimed and easily confirmed.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19940428","headline":"An Inspector Calls; Turning 1946 Stale Into 1994 Stunning","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/theater/an-inspector-calls-turning-1946-stale-into-1994-stunning.html","abstract":"  If there were a society for the preservation and restoration of aging plays, the British director Stephen Daldry would deserve the presidency.

My uncle, who was then a stone mason for Wright, led me past endless Oriental Buddhas, Japanese screens and ceramics. The culmination of the tour was our arrival at the office vault, which was stacked with Wright's Japanese prints.

Mr. Takeshita starts his program with a slide show describing the neighborhood's inception in the 1830's; he then leads a tour through Chinatown's skinny streets to cut free, metaphorically speaking, the maternal spirits. Only then, as he tells several of their stories, can they describe their roles in Chinatown's 160-year history. One example is a woman who, by tradition not allowed to go outside, sat at a tenement window and watched people visiting Transfiguration Church on Mott Street day after day.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940429","headline":"A Hole in the Middle","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/sports/sports-people-basketball-a-hole-in-the-middle.html","abstract":"  With the five-time All-Star BRAD DAUGHERTY still nursing a sore back, the Cavaliers disclosed yesterday that Daugherty's replacement, JOHN WILLIAMS, has an injured right thumb and is lost for the playoffs.

Fra Angelico is probably a better-known figure here than Jan van Eyck, though van Eyck is as great as any Renaissance painter.   Christus painted in Bruges after van Eyck's death there in 1441. For years scholars assumed he was van Eyck's protege because his style seemed to be influenced by the great master. Christus died sometime between late 1475 and early 1476. A small group of works are attributed to him, some of them signed, signatures being still a new device in Netherlandish art, adopted by Christus from van Eyck.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940429","headline":"Article 929972 -- No Title","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/29/arts/article-929972-no-title.html","abstract":"  Some restaurants grow old without getting tired; they simply do things so well that people keep coming. El Cid, at six years old middle-aged in restaurant years, is a case in point.   On a recent Friday night, some friends and I met at a new tapas bar in SoHo that had opened to acclaim. The long, narrow room was, in fact, a bar, with no tables for a party of five. While the menu looked alluring, the insufferable attitude of the staff left us in no mood to accommodate.

This was, after all, the lyric soprano's first full-scale solo recital since being fired by the Metropolitan Opera for \"unprofessional\" behavior. Moreover, her piano accompanist was the artistic director of that very institution, James Levine. And while there were elaborate displays of mutual affection and admiration onstage -- Mr. Levine applauding Ms. Battle, Ms. Battle passing a rose to Mr. Levine -- at least until the encores, much of the audience reaction seemed muted, as if listeners were no longer quite certain about Ms. Battle's superstar status. The applause that consistently interrupted the groups of songs was polite and noncommittal, although one fan's exuberance was so unqualified his cries seemed an embarrassment.    That changed by the end of the evening, though, and at least as far as vocal quality was concerned, the experience of recent months has done no harm. Ms. Battle's mellifluous sound was still intact and perhaps even more controlled and polished than it has been in recent years. She can make a song seem entirely constructed of vowels, eliding all the disruptions of consonants. The voice can slip effortlessly into the ear, leaving behind a silky afterglow. There were some signs of wear, to be sure: a few slides up to pitch, a handful of wavery intonations, a couple of edgy highs. Ms. Battle also shied away from repertory requiring too much technical display. But she can still produce one of the most sensuous sounds on the current opera circuit.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"}],"wiki_events":[],"weather":[{"date":"19940429","time":"1994-04-29
