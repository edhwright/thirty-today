Rustling a tissue, shedding a tear into a beer mug or offering words of consolation would have been more appropriate responses to the dark, depressing songs of Mr. Van Zandt, an influential Texas singer and guitarist. In \"Marie,\" from his new album, \"No Deeper Blue\" (Sugar Hill), the song's unemployed protagonist must leave the housing shelter where he lives when he meets his new wife, Marie. Living under a bridge together, the two suffer nearly all of life's hardships until one morning she dies, still carrying their unborn child. The end.   For more than 30 years, Mr. Van Zandt has been writing songs imbued with a cosmic weariness, one of which, \"Poncho and Lefty,\" went on to become a No. 1 country hit for the duo of Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard.

It can count among its founders the painters Benjamin West and Charles Willson Peale and the gifted sculptor William Rush, and, among its alumni the painters Thomas Eakins, Thomas Anshutz, Robert Henri and Stuart Davis. In 1908, the academy mounted an exhibition of the Realists known as the Eight, organized by Henri, after their paintings had been rejected by the National Academy of Art in New York. And even as late as the mid-1960's, when the Pennsylvania Academy was relatively moribund, its annual exhibitions were routinely reviewed in tandem with those of the Whitney Museum of American Art.    At the moment, the academy may be edging toward the center again. For one thing, the body -- or the figure, as academicians would say -- has been ubiquitous in much recent art, and even realist painting has more adherents among younger artists than it has had in some time. So there's a chance that the academy can remain true to its founding principles and regain a contemporary relevance it has not enjoyed at least since the advent of Abstract Expressionism. More important, the academy itself seems to be trying to raise its profile, celebrating its latest round of renovations with a large exhibition drawn from its idiosyncratic collection.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950314","headline":"What's in a Number? 143 Years of News","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/nyregion/what-s-in-a-number-143-years-of-news.html","abstract":"  This was front-page news in No. 1: \"In England, political affairs are quiet.\" So were two stories about New-York, a city that still had a hyphen in its name: a 35-year-old Manhattan woman had died in police custody, and two Death Row inmates were facing execution.

The former Soviet grandmaster, now a Swiss, is one of the super class who have repeatedly challenged for the world championship.   Scoring 8-3 in a field of 12, Korchnoi was trailed by Boris Gulko, a Fair Lawn, N.J., grandmaster, and John Nunn, an English grandmaster, sharing second place. Each scored 7 1/2-3 1/2 in the tourney, sponsored by Mindscape, maker of the computer program Chessmaster 4000, and by the Mechanics Institute, one of the oldest chess clubs in America.

One virtue of 4 e5 in the Classical French Defense is that it avoids the reduction of material that can arise from 4 Bg5 de 5 Ne4 Be7. Over a century ago, Wilhelm Steinitz favored it because it pressed for spatial superiority in the center. The main question is how well it can put down black counterattacks.   On 4 . . . Nfd7, the old attempt to erect an imposing center with 5 Nce2 c5 6 c3 Nc6 7 f4 b5 8 a3 cd 9 Nd4 Nd4 10 cd has reappeared again; it is not clear whether White's lead in endgame development after 10 . . . b4 11 Nf3 ba 12 ba Ba6 13 Ba6 Qa5 14 Bd2 Qa6 15 Qe2 Qe2 16 Ke2 should amount to anything serious.

Qb6 8 Na4 Qa5 9 c3 cd 10 b4 Nb4 11 cb Bb4 12 Bd2 Bd2 13 Nd2 g5 14 Rb1 gf, but with 15 Bb5 Rb8 16 Nc5 Qc3 17 Nd3, Nigel Short got decisive advantage for White.   Korchnoi's order of moves, 7 . . . cd 8 Nd4 Qb6, produces a considerable change. Now, 9 a3 Bc5 10 Na4 Qa5 11 c3 Bd4 12 Bd4 Nd4 13 Qd4 b6 14 Qb4 Qb4 15 ab Ke7 gives White nothing more than an even game. And the gambit with 9 Qd2 Qb2 10 Rb1 Qa3 11 Bb5 Nd4 12 Bd4 Bb4 13 O-O a6 14 Rb3 Qa5 15 Rfb1 Be7 yields Black positional advantage after 16 Bd7 Bd7 17 Rb7 Rc8 18 Kh1 Bc5 19 Bc5 Rc5 20 Rb8 Bc8, according to an analysis by Jorge Magem Badals in Informant 61.   So Hubner reverted to the sharp 9 Ncb5, which John Nunn introduced in 1988, but Korchnoi unflinchingly came up with the innovation 9 . . . a6!, in place of the weak 9 . . . Bc5 or 9 . . . Qa5. Hubner could not retreat without losing his b2 pawn and therefore came on with 10 Nf5. And once again, Korchnoi stood his ground with 10 . . . Bc5!   He did not mind having his king jolted by 11 Bc5 Nc5 12 Nbd6 Kf8 and he resisted 13 Qh5 by 13 . . . Nd8. A retreat with 14 Nd4 would have failed against 14 . . . Qb4! 15 c3 Qb2 16 Rd1 Qc3 17 Kf2 Bd7 18 Be2 Ba4.   Thus, Hubner tried 14 Ng7, hoping for 14 . . . Kg7 15 Qg5 Kf8 16 Qh6 Kg8 17 Ne8, forcing mate. But Korchnoi struck first with 14 . . . Qb4! 15 c3 Qb2 16 Rd1 (16 Qh6 Qa1 17 Ke2 Ke7 18 Qf6 Kd7 also fails to rescue White) Qc3 17 Rd2 h6! There was no use playing 18 Qh4 because 17 . . . Kg7 18 Qf6 Kh7 19 Nf7 would be crushingly rebuffed by 19 . . . Qd2! 20 Kd2 Ne4!   After 18 Nge8 Ne4!, Korchnoi's easiest winning procedure would probably be 19 Qe2 Ke7 20 Nc8 (20 Ne4? de 21 Nd6 e3 is even worse) Rc8 21 Nd6 Nd6 22 ed Kd6 with two pawns to the good. Hubner gave up.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19950314","headline":"Garbo's Pedestrian Side: Everything Not on Film","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/books/books-of-the-times-garbo-s-pedestrian-side-everything-not-on-film.html","abstract":"  GARBO A Biography  By Barry Paris  Illustrated. 654 pages.

But now a new study by pediatric researchers at Yale University School of Medicine suggests that the parents' observations may be correct.   The study showed that within hours after normal, healthy children are given a lot of sugar on an empty stomach, their bodies release large amounts of the hormone adrenaline, which causes symptoms like shakiness, anxiety, excitement and concentration problems. The children were more likely to report or exhibit these symptoms, and an examination of their brain waves revealed significant changes in their ability to pay attention.","thumbnail":null,"section":"U.S."},{"date":"19950315","headline":"COLLEGE BASKETBALL: Top Rung Is Always a Bit Shaky; This Time, No. 1 U.C.L.A.

PRODUCER     Russo, Marsh & Associates, Alexandria, Va., and Sacramento, Calif. VISUAL     The advertisement begins with the words \"workfare or welfare\" flashed in white letters on a black screen. For most of the rest of the ad, half the screen is filled with a black-and-white photograph of the Assembly Democrat who is under attack, as the script scrolls up the other half. When the narrator mentions Gov. George E. Pataki's support for workfare, a color photograph of the smiling Governor appears. SCRIPT     Announcer: \"Workfare or welfare. It's up to Assembly member John/Jane Doe. You want workfare. So does Gov. George Pataki. Tell Democratic Assembly member Doe welfare doesn't work and to stop wasting our tax dollars. This month, John/Jane Doe will cast a crucial vote to keep welfare or create workfare. Tell him/her you want workfare, not welfare. Tell him/her to vote for Gov. George Pataki's budget plan for change.\" ACCURACY     There is nothing patently inaccurate in the ad except for the implicit suggestion that the Assembly Democrats oppose workfare. In fact, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Democratic leader, maintains that every member of his conference supports the notion that able-bodied welfare recipients should work for their benefits.   Where the parties differ is over how to make that happen. Mr. Pataki has proposed a 90-day limit on employable recipients of the welfare program known as Home Relief, most of whom are single, childless adults. During that 90-day period, he would force welfare recipients to work in public-service jobs. Mr. Silver has said he can support the notion of time limits as long as the state provides job-training programs to prepare welfare recipients for the realities of New York's tough job market. SCORECARD    The strategy is to paint Republicans as the agents of change and Democrats as the defenders of the status quo. Few issues help make that case more effectively than welfare. The ground for this mesage is particularly fertile in the upstate and Long Island districts where this ad is running.    Like most political advertising, the ad simplifies the debate. Mr. Pataki's budget is about far more than workfare, and it includes deep spending cuts that may be anathema even to those who support welfare reform. But personalizing the budget debate may prove effective. Every campaign, after all, needs an enemy.
