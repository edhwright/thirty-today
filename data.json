Eight events scattered around Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens spread the word on two generations of composers. It also sorted their aims into opposing categories: one, the need to be Mexican; the other, a need not to be Mexican at all.   The last piece played, \"La Noche de los Mayas,\" was theoretically this festival's starting point. Written as movie music by Silvestre Revueltas in 1939 and performed by the American Composers Orchestra at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon, its four movements exude an elephantine, wholly irresistible generosity. Booming pentatonic melody signals Mexico's pre-Columbian foundations. Brisk dances expressed in slippery meter changes describe a culture at play. Next a country broods. At the end it explodes: a jungle of percussion, a rhythmic tangle of volcanic energy.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"For Ivory Coast's Founder, Lavish Funeral","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/world/for-ivory-coast-s-founder-lavish-funeral.html","abstract":"  Two months after his death, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, one of the last of a generation of African leaders to guide his people from colonialism, finally received a somber state funeral today in the world's largest church, which he had built in his ancestral village.    The 7,000 guests inside the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro, and the tens of thousands of mourners who endured withering equatorial heat in the huge esplanade outside, witnessed what it seems safe to say was the most lavish ceremony ever held to pay homage to an African leader. A Mix of Traditions    All the panoply of Western religious liturgy mixed with traditional African customs were on display here, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's birthplace: the stirring music of Handel and Gounod; the undulating music and dance of ancient African rituals; a huge chorus dressed in bright batik dress singing \"laagoh budji gnia,\" the Baoule-language words for \"Lord, it is you who has made all things\"; a military honor guard dressed in bright red coats and brandishing glittering swords, and hundreds of village elders, resplendent in huge multi-colored strips of kente and korhogo cloth.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"Classical Music in Review","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/arts/classical-music-in-review-114740.html","abstract":"  New Millennium Ensemble  Weill Recital Hall    The New Millennium Ensemble, a strong new contemporary-music group, made its New York debut on Sunday night with a program weighted toward, but not dominated by, academic composition.

Its cuts and additions -- a billion here, a few hundred million there -- are dwarfed by the total spending proposal of $1.5 trillion. But the tinkering does follow themes, and some areas will fare better, or worse, than others. Here are some examples. Dollar figures show what the Administration seeks from Congress for each program, not what may be spent in the 1995 fiscal year. WINNERS Technology Just about any program whose title boasts the words \"computer\" or \"research\" gains money. Some big winners: the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, once known only for winding the national clock but now a grantor for private research; information \"superhighway\" research. Still, the total Federal research and development budget, up 4 per cent to $72 billion for 1995, only slightly beats inflation.                 Program   1994 spending   1995 spending   Increase or          in millions   in mill-prop.   decrease-per.

Chapter I programs       for low-income schools   $6,912   $7,579   10%       Safe and Drug-free schools   472   660   40%       \"Dislocated\" workers   1,118   1,465   31%       Health Mr. Clinton's health plan aside, the budget envisions large spending increases for a select series of preventive care and drug-rehabilitation programs. Spending in the 1995 fiscal year for the National Institutes of Health's many units -- the National Cancer Institute, National Institute for Mental Health, and so on -- would rise a little over 7 per cent, to $11 billion.

But with crime atop the list of public concerns in polls, the new budget mirrors political reality, and seeks big increases for more police and for prosecuting and jailing wrongdoers. A caveat: much funding relies on passage of the crime bill now before Congress.

Public Works One area where the Clinton Administration differs from its Republican predecessors is in its support for construction projects. Democrats believe economic growth flows directly from investments in highways and mass transportation. But even here, the Administration is selective: for example, grants for operating expenses of mass transit systems (13 percent of which is spent in metropolitan New York) would be cut to $600 million from $800 million.

LOSERS Foreign Affairs The State Department would take it on the nose, losing a bigger share of its budget than any other Cabinet agency. Total foreign affairs funding, which includes items like Pentagon military aid and export loans, stays stable but loses ground to inflation. Aid to Israel ($3 billion) and Egypt ($1.8 billion) would not change. A growth area: aid to the United Nations for troops in foreign war zones, up 33 per cent.

Energy Department stockpiles of nuclear materials would be drawn down. One weapon prospers: the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, beloved by the National Rifle Association and despised by liberals, rises $61,000 to $2.54 million.

In trouble: foreign food aid, oilseed subsidies, the Rural Electrification Administration, the Commodity Credit Corporation (which makes loans for farm exports) and a raft of others.

One big reason is a snow cover that has lingered for about six weeks in many places, including parts of metropolitan New York; without it, nighttime and early-morning temperatures that have been in the teens and single digits would probably have been some 10 degrees higher.   But if the global climate system behaves this year as it has in recent years, scientists say, April and May will bring the latest in a series of abnormally warm springs. This would shrink the snow cover of the entire Northern Hemisphere to a historically small area, and with the cooling effects of the snow lessened, the springtime climate would warm even more. The result: a canceling out of the cold of January and February that would, on balance, make the first half of 1994 warmer than normal.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Science"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"President Plans to Raise Drug Treatment Budget","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/us/clinton-budget-anti-drug-effort-president-plans-raise-drug-treatment-budget.html","abstract":"  Following through on a campaign promise, President Clinton today proposed a sharp increase in spending for drug treatment and programs to prevent drug abuse.

More than a footnote and less than a household name, Mr. Kooper has been most widely heard as a sideman -- the keyboardist on Bob Dylan's mid-1960's masterpieces and on the Rolling Stones' \"Let It Bleed\" -- and he discovered and produced the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd.   But he was more visible in two fondly remembered 1960's bands, the Blues Project and the first lineup of Blood, Sweat and Tears, which were fully and partly reunited for the occasion; Blood, Sweat and Tears was billed as Child Is Father to the Man, the name of its debut album. With both bands, Mr. Kooper was a model of try-everything 1960's eclecticism. The Blues Project dipped into blues, folk-rock and near-jazz; Blood, Sweat and Tears, with its horn section, accessorized 1960's soul with touches of big-band jazz and Renaissance music. One of Mr. Kooper's major skills is in arranging just a few horns (two trumpets, alto saxophone and trombone) to create opulent crescendos, underlining sentiments like \"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know.\"","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"When Push Comes to Shove, Knicks Can't Respond","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/sports/baseball-when-push-comes-to-shove-knicks-can-t-respond.html","abstract":"  The Knicks got what they deserved tonight.

Yet in all the news coverage of skinheads, little attention has been paid to their music. German authorities cite the connection between this music and violence when they add titles to \"the index,\" a list of recordings for which distributors can be prosecuted. According to the Ministry for Women and Youth, there are more than 50 albums and singles on the index.    The authorities have mounted a search and destroy campaign. The most successful raid, in February 1993, brought in more than 30,000 records, tapes and compact discs. A key target has been Rock-O-Rama, a company based in Bruhl. It has 28 bands on its label, including Storkraft, whose lead singer is under investigation for inciting racial hatred and other crimes.   In December, five members of Tonstorung were sentenced to up to 21 months for inciting racial violence, including a 1992 attack on a Turkish wedding party after a concert in Mannheim (the sentences were later suspended). Another band, Radikahl, whose name is a pun combining the German words for radical and bald, was charged in connection with the song \"Swastika,\" which appears here.   These lyrics, collected by the editors of Searchlight, a London-based anti-fascist magazine, and translated by Elizabeth A. Jackson, are typical of neo-Nazi music in their calls for the ethnic purification and military revival of Germany. -- STEPHEN SILVER, staff writer, Searchlight magazine Winter in the F.R.G.

The concert was at times a victim of its own ambition, but its ambition made it special as well. While most tributes to Coltrane venerate the saxophonist for his improvisational ability, this one attempted to rewrite history.   What made the show, presented as part of the Jazz at Lincoln Center series, so complex was its tension between the orthodox interpretations of original material, and the unorthodox. Mr. Jones, who was a member of Coltrane's legendary quartet in the 1960's, was clearly airing out the suites to illustrate Coltrane's approach to composition. He could have chosen to play \"Giant Steps\" with the four or five saxophonists regularly trotted out for Coltrane tributes, but he didn't. In fact, he didn't use a saxophonist at all. And his sidemen -- Wynton Marsalis on trumpet, Marcus Roberts on piano and Reginald Veal on bass -- could have imitated the conventions decreed by the Coltrane quartet of the early 1960's, but they didn't.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Arts"},{"date":"19940208","headline":"Building Chief Resigns Post, Citing 'Stress'","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/nyregion/building-chief-resigns-post-citing-stress.html","abstract":"  New York City's new Buildings Commissioner, Frank A.

Argentine specialists in psychology and psychiatry said in Buenos Aires on Sunday that Maradona needed urgent psychiatric help because, in the words of Mauricio Abadi, the country's best-known psychiatrist, Maradona was \"losing his identity and could become dangerous.\"   According to news reports last week, Maradona fired at journalists with an air rifle outside his sprawling country home near Buenos Aires after he was dismissed by his club, Newell's Old Boys, for repeatedly missing practice. He is scheduled to appear in court today to answer those charges. United States    Without a professional league to keep the players sharp every week, the World Cup team of the United States has been the most active in its preparation for next summer.   After a victory over Norway and ties against Switzerland and Russia last month, the Americans left for Hong Kong yesterday to play in a tournament this week that includes Denmark and Romania.   Coach Bora Milutinovic took 18 players to Hong Kong, where the Americans will open against Denmark on Thursday. None of the players on the squad for the Hong Kong event play in Europe.   The Americans will return to California on Monday and leave two days later for the Joe Robbie Cup in Miami, where they will play Bolivia and Sweden in a tournament that also includes Colombia. Belgium    Immigration authorities have approved the naturalization of Josef Weber of Croatia that will allow him to play for Belgium in the World Cup next summer. Weber's citizenship is expected to be rubber-stamped by the Belgian authorities this week so he can play for Belgium as soon as possible. The 29-year-old Weber, who plays for Cercle Brugge, was the leading scorer in the Belgian League last season and is the leading scorer this season. Mexico    The Mexicans have regressed a great deal, especially defensively, since their surge to becoming one of the world's top teams at the end of last year, when they were the first team to qualify for the World Cup and captured the Gold Cup with a 4-0 triumph over the United States in the championship game. After a poor performance in a 1-1 tie with Bulgaria in San Diego last month, the Mexicans suffered a 5-1 loss to Switzerland and were crushed, 4-1, by the Russians last Wednesday night in Oakland, Calif.   What should be of concern to the Mexicans is that Italy, Ireland and Norway, the teams in their group in the World Cup, play a style similar to those of Switzerland and Russia.  Nigeria    The Super Eagles, who have qualified for the first time for the final stages of the World Cup, suffered a setback in their preparation with the cancellation of their tour of South Africa. The South Africans called off the tour, which was supposed to start last Saturday, when the Super Eagles could not guarantee the release from the clubs of their best players, most of whom play outside Nigeria.  Switzerland    After boycotting a meeting of the Swiss Football Association, members of the World Cup team have been offered improved bonuses for the World Cup and for qualifying for the final stages of the tournament for the first time since 1966. The Swiss will be the first opponent for the Americans. They will play June 18 at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., in the first World Cup game to be played in an indoor stadium.

Others asked why Mr. Reinsdorf gave this man a chance over others who have paid more dues and shown more promise.","thumbnail":null,"section":"Opinion"},{"date":"19940209","headline":"It's Better Late Than Never: Oakley Joins All-Star Cast","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/09/sports/basketball-it-s-better-late-than-never-oakley-joins-all-star-cast.html","abstract":"  Charles Oakley gladly changed his plans for the weekend.

Instead, to the consternation of supporters looking for decisive leadership at a critical moment, right-wing opposition parties are riven by personal rivalries, naked ambitions and nasty name-calling. The feuding became so serious in one important party, Tsomet, that it split in two this week, with talk of a breakaway faction possibly joining the very governing coalition it has denounced.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940209","headline":"Astros' Reliever Gambles And Wins at Arbitration","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/09/sports/baseball-astros-reliever-gambles-and-wins-at-arbitration.html","abstract":"  Of the five players who no longer were on baseball's salary-arbitration list yesterday because they had negotiated contracts, Tom Edens of Houston emerged with the lowest 1994 salary by far.

The ruling added fuel to a three-month public outcry led by the press and politicians who charge that the presence of the United States troops in Juanchaco Bay in southwest Colombia is illegal and that American labor is being used at the expense of unemployed Colombians.","thumbnail":null,"section":"World"},{"date":"19940210","headline":"Report Issued in Helicopter Crash","web_url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/nyregion/report-issued-in-helicopter-crash.html","abstract":"  Inadequate regulation by United States and Canadian transportation agencies contributed to the fatal collision of two helicopters over Niagara Falls in 1992, a final report by Canadian officials says.
